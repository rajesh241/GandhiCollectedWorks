   MY NOTES  
 WORTHY OF EMULATION
 I reproduce the following relevant extract from a reader's letter from Palitana: libtech_221_footnote
 What a great advance in reform can be brought about if other [public] servants emulate this example! Through such work one serves both the Ruler and the people, and one’s own interest as well. This couple will, by and by, have all their cotton and woollen garments made from yarn and wool spun by themselves. We have noted that among the Kaliparaj tribals the annual expenditure  on  clothes amounts to Rs. 10 for every person. The expenditure in the family of this correspondent must be even higher. He will save considerably on that expenditure and, in the bargain, will have acquired a skill, earned the blessings of the poor and learnt something about the varieties of cotton and wool and how to improve their quality. At this time when spinning and allied activities are making good progress in Kathiawar, I wish that officials of all grades who come into frequent contacts with the public in the course of their work should teach the people, as this correspondent does, to spin and do other work relating to khadi. This friend wants a portable spinning-wheel which can be carried on horse- back. Others, too, are likely to ask for such a wheel. But the right solution is that people in every village should have spinning-wheels in their homes. Whether in Kathiawar or elsewhere, there ought to be no village without at least one spinning-wheel. If in a village there is none, arrangements must be made to instal them, so that officials can borrow them and do their spinning. If all the people take up spinning, there should be in the central meeting place in every village two or three spinning-wheels which may be used by the patelslibtech_222_footnotelibtech_223_footnoteas also by the poor people and the officials on their visits. Meanwhile, however, the idea of having a portable spinning-wheel which can be carried on horse-back is an excellent one.
 KHADI STORE
I frequently receive letters about the closure of the khadi store
 
 run by the Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee. One such letter is lying before me just now. I notice from it that there is some misunderstanding about this matter. I have never advised that the Provincial Committee should run no khadi store. What indeed I have suggested is that a khadi store which runs at a great loss or in which the loss is increasing, instead of diminishing, should be closed down, and that buying khadi for a store from outside Gujarat should be stopped. This advice is inspired by nothing else but a careful calculation and some knowledge of economics. I cannot, even in my dream, wish ill of other provinces and well to Gujarat. It is, however, of the very essence of the principle of swadeshi that one should serve one’s neighbours first. This principle is violated when wheat from the south is preferred to the wheat produced in Gujarat and the procedure, therefore, is detrimental to Gujarat, to the south and to the whole country. The philosophy of khadi had its origin in this principle.
 Let us now examine the aims we hope to serve through khadi. The first is that it will revive Indian villages. This can happen only when every village produces its own khadi. This in its turn is possible only if every province produces its own khadi and uses what it produces.
 The second aim behind khadi is to bring about a boycott of foreign cloth through it. This can be achieved only if India manufactures all the cloth its population requires. If Indians demand cloth similar to the foreign product, India cannot meet that demand. Indians, therefore, should accustom themselves to wear, with pleasure, such cloth as the country produces. If all the people insist on wearing only khadi manufactured in Andhra, Andhra cannot meet all that demand and the boycott of foreign cloth can never be  achieved.  Every province, therefore, should try to produce fine khadi. For the same reason, every province should produce its own khadi. As a general rule it is observed that, so long as there is no demand for a commodity, no effort is made to produce it.
 This certainly does not mean that no one should wear or order Andhra khadi. My only point is that the Congress at any rate should always adopt the ideal course. If it wishes, the public will adopt the second best course. If, because the ideal course is difficult, even the Congress does not adopt it, no one else is likely to do, and without such efforts success is impossible.

   SHORTAGE OF SPINNING-WHEELS  
 I notice that spinning has now spread considerably and, in consequence, there is a great demand for supply of spinning-wheels by the Ashram. The latter cannot provide all the spinning-wheels demanded. Nor can the movement progress in this manner. Each province, each district, each taluk and, finally, each village should be able to boast of a carpenter who can make spinning-wheels. The spindle-holders are now made of string or coir. The benefits of the spinning-wheel movement are not confined to the spinners and weavers. It provides work to carpenters and blacksmiths, too. There will be no section of society which will not share in the benefits.
 NEED FOR VOLUNTEERS
 It is but natural that at this time when a determined effort is made to spread the khadi movement in Maha Gujarat we should require a large number of volunteers. We need both part-time volunteers and full-time volunteers. It is essential that every volunteer should know all the processes connected with spinning. Any persons who wish to offer their services as such volunteers may send their names to me, so that as and when the need arises their services may be utilized. This request for names is not addressed to those who are already working some-where or other. I invite, however, the names of persons who are able and willing to serve but who have had no opportunity till now. Those who send their names should also give particulars of their age, aptitude for work, etc.

  From 	the Gujarati original: Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy: Beladevi Nayyar and Dr. Sushila Nayyar      PERTINENT QUESTIONS    	I printed sometime ago a thoughtful letterlibtech_230_footnotelibtech_231_footnotefrom 	Bengal on the question of untouchability. The writer is still 	pursuing his diligent search. Now I have a similar search from a 	Madras correspondent in the form of questions. It is a healthy sign 	that the orthodox Hindus are moved to an inquiry into this thorny 	question. There  is  no  denying the earnestness of the framer of 	the questions. They are typical because there is hardly one among 	the long list that has not been put to me in my rambles. In the 	hope, therefore, that my answers may guide the path of the 	correspondent who claims to be a worker and an earnest seeker, and 	such other workers and seekers, I make an attempt to solve the many 	riddles presented by my correspondent.  What are the practical steps to be taken to remove untouchability?    To 		open to 		untouchables all 		public schools, 		temples and roads 		that are open to 		non-Brahmins and 		are not exclusively 		devoted to any 		particular caste. For caste Hindus to open schools for their children, to dig wells     corresponded 	to February 4.   
 for them where they are in need and to render them all personal service that they may need, e.g., to carry on temperance and hygienic reform among them and to provide them with medical aid.
  What 	would be the 	religious status 	of the 	untouchables when 	the ban of untouchability 	is completely removed? 
 The religious status would be the same as that of the caste Hindus. They will therefore be classed as Sudras instead of Atisudras.libtech_232_footnote
  What 	would be the relation 	between the untouchable 	and the high-caste 	orthodox, Brahmin, when 	untouchability is removed? 
The same as with non-Brahmin Hindus.
 Do 	you advocate 	inter-mingling of castes? 
I would abolish all castes and would keep the four divisions.
  Why 	should not 	the untouchables build 	temples for their 	own worship, 	without interfering 	with the existing temples? 
The “higher” castes have not left them much capacity for such
 enterprise. It is the wrong way of looking at the question to say that they interfere with our temples. We, the so-called higher caste men, have to do our duty by admitting them to the temples common to all Hindus.
  Are 	you an advocate 	of communal 	representation, and do 	you hold 	that the untouchables 	must have representation in 	all administrative 	bodies? 
 I am not. But if the untouchables are purposely shut out by the influential classes, it would be an improper exclusion barring the road to swaraj. My disapproval of communal representation does not mean exclusion of any community from representation but, on the contrary, it lays the burden on the represented communities to see to the proper representation of the unrepresented or inadequately represented communities.
 Are 	you a believer in the efficacy of varnashrama dharma? 
 Yes. But there is today a travesty of varna, no trace of ashram and a misrepresentation of dharma. The whole system needs to be revised and brought in unison with the latest discoveries in the field of religion.
  Don’t 	you believe 	that India is Karmabhumi, 	and that 	everybody born 	here is endowed 	with wealth and intelligence, 	social status 	and religious aspirations 
 
 according to his good or ill deeds in his previous birth?
 Not in the sense the correspondent means. For everybody everywhere reaps as he sows. But India is essentially karmabhumi (land of duty) in contradistinction to bhogabhumi (land  of enjoyment).
  Is 	not education and 	reform among the 	untouchables a 	primary condition to 	be fulfilled are one can begin to talk of the removal of untouchability? 
 There can be no reform or education among the untouchables without the removal of untouchability.
  Is 	it not natural, 	and just as 	it should be, 	that non-drunkards avoid 	drunkards, and 	that vegetarians avoid non-vegetarians? 
 Not necessarily. A teetotaller would regard it as his duty to associate with his drunkard brother for the purpose of weaning him from the evil habit. So may a vegetarian seek out a non-vegetarian.
  Is 	it not true 	that a pure 	man (in the 	sense that he 	is a teetotaller, and 	vegetarian) easily 	becomes an impure 	man (in the sense 	that he becomes 	a drunkard, 	and non-vegetarian) 	when he is made 	to single 	with men who drink, 	and kill, 	and eat 	animals? 
 A man who being unconscious of the wrong, drinks wine and eats flesh foods, is not necessarily an impure man. But I can  understand the possibility of evil resulting from one being made to mingle with a corrupt person. In our case, however, there is no case of making anyone associate with untouchables.
  Is 	it not owing 	to the 	above fact 	that a certain 	class of orthodox 	Brahmins do not 	mingle with the other 	castes (including the 	untouchables), but 	constitute themselves into a separate class, and live together or their spiritual uplift? 
 It must be a poor spirituality that requires to be locked up in a safe. Moreover, days are gone when men used to guard their virtue by permanent isolation.
  Would 	you not be 	interfering with 	the religions and 	caste-system (varnashrama 	dharma) of India, 	whatever may be 	the bad or 	good points of 	the above 	systems and religions, if you advocate the removal of untouchability? 
 How do I interfere with anything or anybody by mere advocacy of a reform? Interference there would be, if I were  to  advocate removal of untouchability by the use of force against those who retain untouchability.
 Would 	you not be guilty 	of doing 	himsalibtech_233_footnoteto the 	orthodox Brahmins, if you 
 
 interefere with their religious beliefs without convincing them in the first instance?
 I cannot be guilty of himsa to the orthodox Brahmins as I do not interfere with their religious belief except through conviction.
  Are 	not the Brahmins guilty 	of untouchability, 	when they do 	not touch, 	dine with or marry the various other castes leaving along the untouchables? 
Brahmins are guilty of the sin if they refuse to “touch” the
other castes.
  Does 	it satisfy 	the hunger 	of the 	untouchable when 	he is made 	to parade Brahmin 	agraharamslibtech_234_footnotein the exercise 	of his right 	as a man? 
Man does not live by bread alone. Many prefer self-respect to
food.
  Does 	not satyagraha 	in this 	direction lead 	to violence, seeing 	that the 	untouchables are not so 	well educated 	as to understand 	the full 	doctrine of non- violence 	non-co-operation, and 	also seeing that 	the Brahmin cares more 	for his 	religion than 	or politics? 
If reference is to Vykom, experience shows that the “untouch-
 able” has shown amazing self-restraint. The latter part of the question suggests the possibility of violence by the Brahmins concerned. I should be sorry if they resort to violence. They would then have shown, in my opinion, not regard for religion but ignorance of and contempt for religion.
  Do 	you advocate 	that all 	should become equal, 	without any distinction 	of caste, race, creed or avocation? 
 Such should be the case in the eye of the law in the matter of elementary human rights, even as, irrespective of caste, race, creed or colour, we have certain things in common, e.g., hunger, thirst, etc.
  Would 	that supreme 	philosophical truth be of 	any use in 	the field 	of practical 	politics, to 	the average 	grihastha or 	householder, seeing 	that only great souls, who 	have come to 	the end of 	their cycle of 	karma, could realize are 	practise that supreme 	philosophical truth, and 	not the ordinary 	grihastha, 	who has only to 	follow what 	the rishislibtech_235_footnotehave ordained, and 	in that 	following, get discipline 	which consequently leads  	to release from birth and death? 
Not much “supreme  philosophical  truth”  is  involved   in   the
 recognition of the simple truth that no human being is to be regarded as untouchable by reason of his birth. The truth is so simple that it is
 
 recognized all over the world except by orthodox Hindus. I have questioned the statement that the rishis taught the doctrine of untouchability as we practise it.

96. ON ANOTHER’S LAND
A friend says :
 You ask us at every turn to yield to Mussalmans, you ask us to resort to law- courts on any account. Have you fully considered the consequences of what you are saying? Have you taken into the account human nature? What are we to do when mosques are being put up on our ground without our permission? What are we to do when unscrupulous men bring suits against us for monies we do not owe or when they actually rob us of our possessions. In giving your answers you must take our poor selves into consideration. You dare not say you do not know us. Or if you give your fatwaslibtech_236_footnotein utter obliviousness of us, you must not blame us if we do not respond to your counsels of perfection. Let me tell you that you are sometimes impossible.
 I sympathize with the friends who talk to me in this strain. I am prepared to recognize the limitations of human nature for the very simple reason that I recognise my own. But precisely as recognizing my own limitations, I do not decieve myself by refusing to distignuish between what I ought to do and what I fail to do. I must not deceive others by refusing to notice the same distinction and telling them that what they propose to do is not only perhaps defensible but also right. Many things are impossible and yet are the only things right. A reformer’s business is to make the impossible possible by giving an ocular demonstration of the possibility in his own conduct. Whoever thought it possible before Edison to speak to people hundreds of miles away from us. Marconi went a step further and made wireless communication possible. We are daily witnessing the phenomenon of the impossible of yesterday becoming the possible of today. As in physical science so in psychological.
 Now for the concrete questions. The question of mosques built on another's land without his permission is incredibly simple. If A is in possession of his land and someone comes to build some things on it, be it even a mosque. A has the right at the first opportunity of
 
 pulling down the structure. Any building of the shape of a mosque is not a mos-que. A building to be a mosque must be duly consecrated. A building put up on another’s land without his permission is a pure robbery. Robbery cannot be consecrated. If A has not the will or the capacity to destroy the building miscalled mosque, he has the right of going to a law court to have the building pulled down. Law-courts are forbidden to convinced non-co-operators but not to those who require such conviction. Moreover, full non-co-operation we have never practised. A practice has a flaw in it when it is not only inconvenient but clearly defeats the end it was desi-gned to serve. So long as I own property I must defend it whether by the force of law-courts or by the force of my own strong arms. The act is in essence the same. Our national non-co-operation is or was with a system. It presupposed co- operation among ourselves in a general way. But when we non-co- operate among ourselves, national non-co-operation is a mira-ge. Individual non-co-operation is possible when we own not a clod of earth. It is possible only for sannyasin. The highest fulfilment of religi-on therefore requires a giving up of all possession. Having ascertained the law of our being, we must set about reducing it to practice to the extent of our capacity and no further. That is the middle way. When a robber comes to take away A’s property he can deliver the property to him, if he recognizes in him a blood brother. If he does not feel like one but dreads the robber and would wish that someone was near to knock him down, he must try to knock him down and take the consequence. If he has the desire but not the ability to fight the robber, he must allow himself to be robbed and then call in the assistance of law-courts to regain the lost property. In both the cases he has as good a chance of losing his property as of regaining it. If he is a sane man like me, he would reach with me the conclusion that to be really happy he must not own anything or own things only so long as his neighbours permit him. In the last resort we live not by our physical strength but by sufferance. Hence the necessity of uttermost humility and absolute reliance on God. This is living by soul-force. This is highest self-expression.
 Let us bear the law in mind not as an academic and attractive proposition when it is written on paper but as the law of our being to be continually realized and let us fashion our practice in accordance with the law and the measure of our ability to live up to it.

   WELL DONE  
 The Secretary, Taluka Congress Committee, Haliyal, Karwar, writes:
 Our Municipality here has a congress majority. We are therefore trying to carry out the Congress programme through it. Spinning has been made compulsory in the municipal schools. Municipal employees have khaddar costumes given to them. Primary education of the children of depressed classes has been made free and compulsory. Their children sit side by side with other children. They are permitted to make use of the common tank. We have no Hindu-Muslim or Brahmin-non-Brahmin differences. We are organizing a temperance campaign.
This is all good and substantial work. I congratulate the Haliyal
Taluka Congress Committee on its solid constructive work and wish that other will follow them.

   NOTES  
 TOWARDS UNITY
 The All-Party Committee met to consider the questions referred to it by the Conference. It appointed a sub-committee of nearly fifty to consider the question. The sub-committee appointed a smaller committee to consider all possible swaraj schemes and report to the sub-committee the results of its deliberations. Dr. Besant is labouring at this smaller committee with her usual application and energy which put to shame younger men and women. But naturally the attention centred round the Hindu-Muslim problem; not that it is intrinsically more important except for individuals like me but because it blocks all progress towards swaraj. The sub-committee proved too formal for the task. It was necessary to avoid the reserve and the stiffness even of a committee and to be absolutely informal and to have a still smaller number of persons. This was done and a few of each community met at Hakim Saheb’s house. The result has been succinctly given to the Press by Pandit Motilalji Nehru. I agree that there is no cause for anxiety or disappointment. For all want a solution. Some want it at once, some regard the time not to be seasonable, some would sacrifice everything to get a solution, others would be cautious and would wait till they have secured what to them is an indispensable minimum. But all agreed that a solution of the problem was essential to swaraj. And
 as all want swaraj, a solution must not be beyond the reach of those who are engaged in finding it. The prospect was never so bright as when we parted to meet again on 28th February. Meanwhile everyone is to explore fresh avenues to a settlement.
 The public will want to know my view of communal representation. I am opposed to it with all my heart but I would agree to anything so long as it ensures peace and is honourable to both the parties. In the absence of agreement on the plans suggested by either party I have presented a solution which might answer the purpose . But I need not discuss it at the present stage. I hope that the  responsible members of both the communities will leave no stone unturned whether by means of private, quiet talks or by means of a public expression of their opinions. I hope too that newspapermen will write nothing to irritate any party but will observe discreet silence where they cannot usefully assist.
 INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA
 The Viceregal answer to the Deputation that waited on His Excellency was sympathetic but non-committal. It betrays unne- cessary consideration for the difficulties of the Union Government. It is just for one Government to appreciate the difficulties of another but the performance might easily be overdone. The Union Government observed no delicacy when it had to make its choice. The Indian Government has had many an occasion to make such a choice. Each time, except once, it has surrendered. The exception was made by Lord Hardingelibtech_237_footnotelibtech_238_footnotewho hurled  defiance  at  the  Government  of  South Africa and ranged himself on the side of Indians in South Africa. There were reasons for it. The Indians were fighting by direct action. The method was new. They had proved their capacity for resistance and suffering and yet they were demonstrably and wholly  non- violent. But at the present moment Indians of South Africa are leaderless.  With  Sorabjilibtech_239_footnotelibtech_240_footnote,  Kachalialibtech_241_footnotelibtech_242_footnote,  P.K.Naidulibtech_243_footnoteand   now   Rustomji gone, they do not know what they should do or can do. There is ample scope for nonviolent action. But it requires thinking out and
 
 
 vigorous working out. That seems hardly possible at the present moment. I have, however, great hope of one or two young men who are resident in South Africa. Not the least among them in Sorabji, the brave son of the brave Rustomji. Young Sorabji is himself a seasoned soldier in satyagraha. He has been to prison. He organized the wonderful receptions that were given in Natal to Sarojini Devilibtech_244_footnote. Let our countrymen in South Africa realize that they must work out their own salvation. Even heaven helps only those who help themselves. They will find that if they show their original grit and spirit and sacrifice, they will have the people of India, the Government of India and the world helping and fighting for them.
 There is a passage in the Viceregal pronouncement which needs supplementing. His Excellency says,
 It is stated in your address that “the Municipal Franchise was solemnly assured to Indians by the Natal Government when in 1896 Indians were deprived of the Parliamentary Franchise.” But you have not indicated the exact source or the nature of the assurance. My Government are making the necessary enquiries to verify the position.
 The statement made by the Deputation is substantially correct. It was, however, not in 1896 but probably in 1894 that the assurance was given. I am writing from memory. The facts are these. It was in 1894 that the first disfranchising bill was passed by the Natal Assembly. Whilst it was passing through that assembly a petition was presented to  it on behalf of Indians wherein it was stated that the Indians enjoyed in India the Municipal and indirectly even the political franchise. Fear was also expressed that the deprivation of the political franchise was likely to be a prelude to that of the Municipal Franchise. It was in answer to this petition that the late Sir John Robinson, the Premier of Natal, and the late Mr. Escombe, the Attorney General, gave the assurance that there was no intention to go further and deprive the Indians of the Municipal Franchise at a future date. The disfranchising bill was disallowed by the superior Government but another non-racial in character was passed. The assurance referred to by me was several times repeated by Mr. Escombe who had charge of all the bills and who was virtually the dictator of Natal’s policy whilst
 
 he was in office.
 IS A SWARAJIST A ONGRESSMAN ?
 I have before me a curious letter in which the writer says, a distinction is being made by Congressmen in Sind between Swarajists and Congressmen, and the former are obstructed by  the  latter.  I should have hoped that such a thing would be impossible after the Belgaum Congress which recognizes the Swaraj Party as an integral party of the Congress and which suspends the non-co-operation programme. Every Swarajist who subscribes to the Congress creed and conforms to the new franchise is as much a Congressman as the one who is not a Swarajist, that is to say, who does not believe in Council- entry. Let it be also remembered that the Swaraj Party has itself altered its constitution to make it obligatory on every member of that party to accept the Congress franchise. There should therefore not only be no obstruction by one of the other but each should help the other wherever the help is not inconsistent with one’s conscience.
 FROM VYKOM
 The following from the Satyagraha Ashram at Vykom cannot fail to be of general interest.
 I hope you have got our telegram about the spinning competition. Two volunteers took 578 yards and 508 yds., each yarn being of 8 counts. Our weaving is not up to the mark now since some of the boys who knew weaving have left the Ashram on leave. We have, according to the directions of Vinobaji,libtech_245_footnotereduced our number to barely fifty. But this has proved trouble- some since the climate here is very bad and many of the resident volunteers become incapacitated to offer satyagraha for six hours. So it has become necessary to go in for some ten to fifteen volunteers more, so that we have to keep a permanent strength of 60 volunteers. I hope you will agree that this is necessary.
 Of the 24 hours 8 hours for sleep, 6 hours for satyagraha, 2 hours for spinning, 1 hour for HIndi, 2 hours for Ashram work (sweeping, washing, etc.), 2 hours for meals, bath, and other bodily wants, 1 hour for reading-room and 2 hours for daily prayer and meetings in which usually some good subjects are dealt with either by me or by some of the prominent guests who usually attend the Ashram.
 Our treasurer is now exerting himself for building a school in memory of
 
 
 the satyagraha campaign under orders from Sri Narayana Guru.libtech_246_footnoteAll of us are anxiously waiting for your coming here. It has become almost an obsession with most people here to consider what they should do to expedite your coming. I hope that God will grant you the health and time to proceed here shortly.
The scrupulous care with which things are being managed by
 the Vykom satyagrahis is the surest assurance of success. It may seemingly take long, but it is my deliberate conviction that it is none the less the quickest way. It is the only true way. The fight against untouchability is a religious fight. It is a fight for the recognition of human dignity. It is a fight for a mighty reform in Hinduism. It is a fight against the entrenched citadels of orthodoxy. Victory which is a certainly is worth the patience and the sacrifice, the band of devoted young Hindus is giving to it. The process of waiting is a process of self-purification for the young men engaged in the fight. If they persist they will be ranked among the makers of India of the future.
 As for the satyagrahis longing that I should go to Vykom I can only give them the assurance that I am longing to be with them. I am looking for a chance. But the choice becomes difficult when there are so many calls upon my time. My heart and my prayers are with them; who knows that they are not more than my bodily presence in their midst.
 BEWARE
 The Ganjam District Congress Committee has sent me a postcard from a dealer asking for quotations for hanks of 2,000 yards of yarn for the purpose of sale on the market. It is not possible to object to such an open trade. But those who do not want to spin but want to buy yarn and to give it as their subscription, should beware of buying yarn in the bazaar. They should try to get their quota spun in their own families. If that be not possible they should engage a reliable spinner and get him to supply the yarn. The Akola Congre-ssmen who do not want to spin themselves have solved their difficulty by getting Mr. Mashruwalalibtech_247_footnotewho   is  an   enthusiastic   believer   in   hand-spinning   to supply them with the required quantity. This ensures the kind and the quality of yarn. No province should import hand-spun yarn from
 
 another province.
 
 
WASTE OF YARN
 A 	friend from Kumbakonam writes:  Perhaps 	you are aware 	of a 	custom, now 	prevalent in 	the country, 	to honour 	political leaders with 	hand-spun yarn garlands. 	Such garlands are 	invariably used 	on every 	political occasion and 	I may 	add that an enormous 	quantity of hand-spun 	yarn is wasted since none takes care of it. As an example  of such 	waste, I have 	sent per separate 	post, a parcel 	of yarn 	which I was 	able to 	pick up at the Tamil Nadu Khilafat Conference held recently at 	Kumbakonam under the Presidency of Maulana Shaukat Alilibtech_248_footnote. But 	for my interest 	in the 	yarn 960 	yards of 	yarn would 	have gone to 	waste. I am sure that 	at the said Conference 	alone, much larger quantity of yarn had been wasted. Hence I would 	like to 	suggest to 	you to 	instruct our 	countrymen through 	Young India to 	prepare garlands in 	hanks of 	uniform length, say 	2,000 yards, so 	that at 	every meeting 	garlands of 2,000 	yards may be collected 	and utilized 	according as the 	garlanded leaders propose.  	I can endorse the correspondent’s complaint as to waste. It is a 	good custom to present leaders with yarn garlands but they should be 	prettily made and not much yarn should be used in them. If the idea 	be to present yarn to leaders and not to garland them, the 	correspondent’s suggestion should be adopted and uniform  size  	hanks should be given. For, if the habit of presenting yarn garlands 	becomes universal and care is not taken, there might be an enormous 	waste of good yarn which might otherwise have been utilized for 	making cheap khaddar for poor people.  	“HABITUAL 	WEARING” A 	Bengal school teacher writes:  I 	am a 	teacher of 	a national 	school. The resolution 	about national schools 	passed at 	Belgaum has 	given rise to 	considerable stir amongst 	the teachers 	and students 	of national 	schools. Some are trying 	to interpret 	the resolution 	as it 	suits their own 	interest. The 	words “habitual wearing 	of khaddar 	by students” 	is being 	interpreted by 	some as 	not meaning 	compulsory wearing and 	hence they 	say that 	those, who are attending 	school without 	khadi on, 	need not 	be debarred. 	All that 	the teachers 	should do is always 	to ask them 	to put on khadi 	and gradually 	initiate them into wearing it. 	They say, even if 	they have to 	wait indefinitely to see their students clad in khadi they can continue calling their    
 institutions “national” without transgressing the resolution of Belgaum. They say, even if 60 p.c. of the students come to school with mill cloth they can claim to call their schools national if only the school teachers continued teaching the utility and propriety of using khaddar, hoping that they would take to it in due course which may be six months, one year or even more.
 In our opinion the resolution does not admit of this interpretation. It means that the schools should not tolerate anybody’s coming to school without khaddar but in cases of emergency or helplessness resulting from unavoidable causes over which one has no control a student may be allowed to join school on rare occasions. We think the resolution debars everybody from attending who systematically comes to school without khaddar. We have been trying to run the institutions in our area on this line.
 I therefore appeal to you to write to me, and in the pages of Young India  if you think it necessary, the real meaning and sense of the resolution in clear unequivocal language so that your idea about the point may be known to all concerned.
 I have no doubt about the meaning of the word “habitual”. My correspondent’s meaning is the only possible meaning. A school cannot be called national, in terms of the Congress resolu- tion, whose scholars do not wear khaddar as a rule. But in seek- ing to know the meaning of words, the safest rule is “go to the dictionary”. Here is the meaning given in the Concise Oxford Dictio-nary of the word “habitual”: “customary, constant, continual”.
 SHOULD  THEY AFFILIATE
 The question then arises: are the schools which cannot fulfil the test then to become affiliated as Government institutions? Surely such is not the only alternative or for that matter any, for a school that has non-co-operated. There is room enough for schools independent both of the Congress and the Government. There may be schools whose conductors do not believe in Government patronage, control or interference and yet may not believe for instance in khadi or in teaching the vernacular or Hindustani. There is no reason why such schools should not continue if they receive public support or the conductors are themselves rich enough to carry them on themselves. All that the Congress has done is to prescribe the limits within which it can recognize or support educational institutions. And what can be more natural than that the Congress should insist on Congress institutions conforming to conditions which in the opinion of Congressmen promote the interest of the country?
 TILAK MAHARASHTRA UNIVERSITY
 Mr. Gharpure, the Registrar of the Tilak Maharashtra University, writes:
 Many friends and colleagues have drawn my attention to a sentence in your presidential address on page 25, last two lines. “Many provinces have their national schools and colleges. Gujarat alone has a National University maintained at an annual cost of Rs. 1,00,000/- and having control of three colleges and 70 schools wih 9,000 pupils.”
 This gives rise to a misunderstanding. You are right if you mean that no other Province has a University maintained at an annual cost of one lakh. But people are liable to interpret it in another way, viz., that no other Province has a University. The cost is regarded only as an adjectival clause.
 I shall be glad if you will be kind enough to remove this misunders- tanding through the pages of Young India as early as you can.
 The Tilak Maharashtra University is maintained at an annual cost of Rs. 6,000, with three colleges, 30 schools and 2,000 students. The annual cost is less simply because each college and school takes care of its own self and no charges are made to the University.
 The National Medical College is not yet recognized though it is on the way to it. Still the Tilak Mahavidyalaya maintains 75 students with an annual cost of Rs. 15,000.
I had thought that I knew English fairly well and that read in its
 context the sentence, referred to by Mr. Gharpure, was capable of bearing only one meaning, i.e., that not to mention the other  provinces, Gujarat alone underwent so much expense and trained so many scholars. But I see that friends at least  as  conversant  with English as myself have put a different construction upon the sentence. My only consolation is that both they and I are judging the meaning of a sentence written in a language foreign to us. I therefore derive the very poor consolation from the thought that they are as likely to be wrong in their interpretation as I in mine. But I can give them the assurance that I used Gujarat as merely an illustration and I mention Gujarat rather than any other province because I had the figures relating to Gujarat at hand. The emphasis was not meant for the University as distinguished from schools and colleges. I was aware at the time of writing my address, not only of the Gujarat National University but also of the Muslim National University at Aligarh and the Punjab National University at Lahore and the Bihar National University at Patna and the Kashi Vidyapith at Banaras besides the
 Tilak Maharashtra University. I do not know the expenses of the Punjab and the Bihar Universities and the Kashi Vidyapith. But  I know that the Muslim University cost last year nearly Rs. 75,000.
 VOLUNTEERS
 I have been asked to give my impressions of the volunteers’ work at Belgaum during the Congress week. I thought that I had already dealt with it in my Belgaum impressions. But I gladly respond. Their work will bear a fuller and separate treatment. In my opinion the volunteers reached at Belgaum comparatively the highest watermark in efficiency within my experience of four Congresses. They were hardworking, efficient and willing. I heard no complaint from the delegates about them. Physically too they appeared to me to be fit. Dr. Hardikarlibtech_249_footnotelibtech_250_footnotewas good enough to take me through their camp which had a businesslike appearance and was fairly tidy. I say fairly tidy for in my opinion a volunteer camp must be a model of tidiness, not a thing being out of its place and everything being not only in its own place but being in its place in a neat manner. For instance, a volunteer may have his bedding in its place and yet may have put it in  a heap instead of having properly and neatly folded it in the prescribed manner. In point of sanitation too a volunteer camp must be perfect, not a scrap of paper or dirt should be found anywhere. I understand that Dr. Hardikar specially restricted the number of volunteers. They had therefore more than a fair share of work to do. During the time that the Congress was in session they had to work over sixteen hours per day, being on their legs practically the whole of that time. I must not omit to mention the lady volunteers. They were most helpful and attentive. They too had undergone previous training. Though we cannot manage a Congress session without the efficient help of volunteers, let me say that work is the least part of  a  volunteer’s training. Volunteers must be our greatest asset in winning swaraj. This they can only be, if in addition to having a spotless character and the necessary training in drilling, sanitation and first aid to the injured, they know how to organize the nation for swaraj. For this purpose therefore every volunteer must be an expert carder and spinner, and must be able in addition to doing his share of spinning, necessary for the franchise, to organize carding and spinning in his own district. It should be remembered that hand-spinning has been
 
 part of a volunteer’s training since 1921.
 STRIKING, IF TRUE
 A correspondent writes severely criticizing the  cry  of Mussalman deficiency in the matter of education and says that I am being deceived. In order to enlighten me he has sent me some striking figures showing the proportion of literates among the two communities. I reproduce them below.

favourable to the Mussalmans. Nevertheless my statement stands. The real rivalry is not between the rank and file—the merely literate—but
 between the highly educated among both. And I suppose it is an undeniable fact that the so-called higher education is not so common among the Mussalmans as among the Hindus. I should like my correspondent to examine the figures as to higher education and say whether I am not right. Meanwhile let the students of statistics analyse the returns reproduced above and inform me of any inaccuracy in them. I have taken it for granted that the absence of figures for the provinces not mentioned by the correspondent shows that the figures in respect of them were not favourable to the charge brought by him. So far as literacy among women is concerned, I am glad to find that the percentage among Mussalman sisters in so many provinces is higher than among Hindu women. It shows that the purdah is no bar to literacy. This is no defence of the purdah for I am totally opposed to it. I note the fact as a pleasant surprise. For whilst I knew that many Mussalman sisters though remaining in seclusion were learned, I did not know that literacy among them was higher than among Hindu sisters.
 EASONABLE IGURES
 Whilst the Hindu-Muslim question is occupying the attention of the country, the readers will appreciate the following tablelibtech_251_footnoteprepared by a friend and giving the percentage of population according to religion in India as a whole and also in the various provinces.

   SPEECH AT RAWALPINDIlibtech_255_footnote  
 February 5, 1925
 I was present here last December and held some talks with you.libtech_256_footnoteAt that time I assured you that if you all had not returned to Kohat, I would come back and would talk to you; and if some Muslim brothers came by then from Kohat, I would make some inquiries also.
 Some Muslim brothers have come from Kohat and I am talking things over with them. As a result of these discussions I am in no position to advise you to go back to Kohat. I was hoping that by holding talks with them something good might turn up. I am not without hope but today I do not have a single reason for asking you to return to Kohat. In fact I feel like advising you to the contrary. It is possible that I may not succeed in my task with the Muslim brethren. Moreover those Muslims who have got a hold over Kohat have not come here. On the other hand they have sent a telegram saying, “A compromise has already been reached here and the Hindus are returning to Kohat. Why do you call us then? Why do you again throw all people into panic?
 The implication is that Shaukat Ali and myself should not interfere in this matter. But while talking to the Muslims who have come here I asked them, “Do you take the responsibility of taking Hindus to Kohat?” One of the gentlemen frankly replied, “If the Hindus want to return to Kohat, let them do so but we can take no responsibility. We are not even in a position to invite them, the reason being that those who are there at present are hated.” So I cannot advise you to go back to Kohat.
 There is yet another matter. If you want to return there relying on the strength of the Government and if the talks with the Government have inspired some faith in you, you are free to go back. But even now I hold firm to the belief that we are not going to benefit by working with or through the Government . And therefore I do not advise you to go there under the protection of the Government. Wherever you stay you have to rely on your own strength.
 
 
 If there is need for holding talks with anyone before returning to Kohat it is with the Muslims. In the first place their number is large. Even if they were equal in number it would not be good to return without holding talks with them since we have run away from there in fear. It is a different thing if someone goes there and sacrifices ones honour for the sake of money or for saving one’s life. To me it is not a life worth living, it is veritable death.
 I learnt something very distressing yesterday namely, that many among you embraced Islam to save your lives and then you came here. In my view such poeple have not truly embraced Islam but have done so under fear and in order to save their lives. If it were not so why should they say, Cut off my tuft “or Make me  read  the  Kalama”? If we do so the Gayatri libtech_257_footnotewould have no meaning and our Hinduism too would be deemed meaningless. This is true or Sikhs and Arya Samajists as well. What I mean to say is that we should be prepared to lose our lives but not to change our faith. Our true wealth is not money, land or gold. They can be pillaged. But our true wealth is religion. When we abandon that we can be said to have pillaged our own homes. Ever since I heard these things I feel there is nothing to be gained in your going and staying there. You are losing much through love of wealth and life.
 Sometimes Muslims kidnap a woman and make her embrace Islam. I do not understand how, in this manner, she can become a Muslim. She does not know the Koran. She does not know the Kalama. Alas, she knows very little even of her own religion. I cannot understand how she can become a Muslim. If someone abducts my wife and she reads the Kalama, then I can no more live in this world. Either I would seek your help [in defending her] or beg you to take her back into the Hindu fold. I would be a coward if I did not act in this manner. I cannot claim to be her husband. If you are men and wish to live like men, then make a solemn declaration that as long as conditions do not change, you will not return to Kohat.
 I am told that if Kohat Hindus do not return, other Hindus also may well flee from the Frontier Province. I think it would be right if that happened. I ask you to live there in your own strength or in friendship with Muslims. I do not wish that Hindus should become cowards. I wish to make both Hindus and Muslims brave. I want that
 
 they should grow together in strength. I cannot bear it if Hindus grow in strength by destroying Muslims or the other way about. Hinduism does not teach us to destroy other religions.
 I could not swallow that argument yesterday about  the possibility of a Hindu woman being converted to Islam. I wish to have this point further clarified by Muslim friends— does Islam teach them to abduct my wife? My wife might not even know what Islam and Christianity are about. She was born in a Hindu family, she chants the name of Rama, and reads the Ramayana  and  Bhagavatalibtech_258_footnotelibtech_259_footnote. She cannot use her intellect in embracing Islam. She continues to stick to her own dharma and that too with complete faith. What should one make of it if someone comes and tells one that such a woman has embraced Islam? She has not embraced Islam in full knowledge and therefore she is not prepared to regard herself as a Muslim. I want to ask Muslim friends: Does their religion teach them to abduct anyone’s wife and make her a Muslim? It is unbearable for me if any woman living in the Frontier Province is forcibly violated. If it is argued that she has embraced Islam, I am not prepared to believe it. That is why I want to tell you that if you hold your religion dear, then do not go back as long as Muslims there do not say, “Come back with honour”; you should not go till then. If you go back you might make money but if you forsake your dharma and live there, that life is not worth living.
 So far you have not died of hunger. In December I told you that I couldn’t bear any able-bodied man living by alms, i.e., by begging for food. If I advise you to do that, I would be doing a wrong thing. Even today I am firm in this. That is why I have not asked for a single pie for Kohat. I would collect funds only when I know the purpose for which they are collected. I have made no list. It is true that if someone has sent something to me [for the relief of Kohat Hindus], I redirect that there. But if you act on my advice and those who are able-bodied live on their own labour, I pledge you my full help.
 I am even prepared to take you to Sabarmati. There I shall give you whatever you need as food and shelter. I shall share my food with you. First I shall see you eat and then eat myself. But I will take full eight hours’ work daily. If you intend to do manual labour, I am
 
 
 prepared to help you in every way. But if some of you say “we are lawyers and get us a practice”, that I can’t do. I can’t get you a brief by getting two persons to quarrel. Similarly if some businessmen demand rupees ten or twenty lakhs or ten thousand, I certainly can't give them that. I can only provide you some kind of work. With this end in view I tell the people of India that everyone should ply the charkha at least for an hour daily. The charkha is a symbol of labour. One who plies the charkha can do other work also. I can't offer you work on land. But there is plenty of work by way of spinning, ginning and weaving from which lakhs [of people] can earn their livelihood. I read in the newspapers that the Maharaja of Mysore has also started spinning on the charkha. If those among you who are artisans want implements for their vocation, such as gold-smiths’ implements,— it will be my job to provide them. It is my duty to make arrangements for each man to pursue his vocation. I am prepared to beg on their behalf. So I ask you again to prepare lists from which we can know how many can pursue a particular vocation and how many members of their families can work and what kind of work they can do. Even a sick or infirm person can do some work. I get work out of  my widowed sister and only then do I feed her. She says, “we are children of a Diwan”, but I do not believe in these [distinctions]. We are only labourers in the service of India; so I cannot but exact work from those whom I feed. I keep a clear account with my sister and wife and so I shall even with a widow.
 There is something I have heard and which has pained me. I have heard that some of the Kohat Hindus gamble; some, having  taken their ration once, ask for it again and make a row if they do not get it; if they have one quilt they ask for a second and make money by selling it. This distresses me much. I can bear what has happened in Kohat but if these things are true I cannot bear that. If you want to live like this then you may return to Kohat and drown your religion. In my view religion does not mean that one becomes a Hindu simply because one reads the Gayatri. According to me, he alone is a Hindu in whose heart the Gayatri is inscribed. A man does not become a Sikh by merely reciting the Granth Sahib. He alone is a true Sikh who cherishes the Granth Sahib in his heart with genuine pride. One does not become an Arya Samajist because one chants Vedic mantras well. But one who shapes his life in accordance with those mantras is a true Arya Samajist. I will ask Muslims also whether I become a Muslim because I read the Kalama. Thus, ever since I have heard this about
 you I have been greatly perturbed.
 This is Kaliyugalibtech_260_footnoteand only because of such incidents are we in a fallen state. I request you not to put me to shame by behaving in such manner. If you want to act in this way then keep me away from you, because I would not be fit for your service.
 Malaviyajilibtech_261_footnoteagrees with me that you should not go to Kohat in this kind of atmosphere. I would not put him to the trouble of coming here, because in the Central Assembly a decision is being taken on the Bengal Ordinance and he is busy there. He was ready to come here but I told him that I would not trouble him this time. Lalaji also arrived here today. He had telephoned from Lahore. I invited him here but unfortunately he fell ill and could not be with us today. I gave him the trouble of coming here—Rawalpindi—because if we two are not of one mind, then you would be deceived. We three hold the same opinion. They do not know what I told you about Islam. But in view of what has happened in Kohat, they have come to the identical view that it would be wrong for you to return under the existing conditons. What I said over and above that was that without effecting a settlement with the Muslims it would be wrong for you to return.
 I do not even wish that the free food being given to you now should be continued. It is written in the Gita that he who eats without performing yajnalibtech_262_footnoteis in fact a thief.  Yajna has many meanings and physical labour is one of them. So it is a sin to eat without labour. I have come to talk things over with you. If you want to know anything else, you can question me. I want that you should tell those working here to make a list of persons having food here and also tell them that whatever you take from here, you would return through your labour. You must find some work for yourselves. If you come to Sabarmati with me I am prepared to give you some work. I feel like staying here with you and doing some manual work. At present, I have also other work to do. That is why I cannot stay with you. Sit down together, all of you, and think it over. If my proposal is acceptable to you, then rent a house, set up a loom and start work. I am prepared to get funds for that. There is nothing to be ashamed of in asking me for money
 
 for this purpose.
 I have thus made the request I had wanted to. I am ready to reply to your questions. Let me also know if what I have heard about you is wrong. To those who have given you shelter you owe a duty and that is to take up some work for yourselves.

   EXAMINATION OF KAMAL JAILANE ON KOHAT RIOTlibtech_263_footnote  
 [RAWALPINDI]
 February 6, 1925
Q. Do you live near Kohat?
A.	I live quite close by.
Q. Are you a zamindar?
A.	I  am a  zamindar. I own several villages in.	libtech_264_footnoteBesides these our ancestors
were given shares in lands in almost all the villages (here).
Q. Are you on good terms with the Hindus?
A.	I can confidently claim that my relations with the Hindus are very good.
 Q. Do you ever live in Kohat itself?
 A.	I come and go to and from that place daily, as my dwelling place is only 500 yards away from it.
 Q.	What do you think is the cause of the disturbance between the Hindus and Mussalmans?
 A.	I think it was due to several causes that existed already. The pamphletlibtech_265_footnoteaffair proved to be the last drop. It occasioned the outbreak, but the hearts of the parties had been poisoned already.
Q. Will you please briefly explain yourself on this point?
 
 
 seems, I have exhausted all my skill in cross-examination. The witnesses never realized that they were being cross-examined.” Mahadevbhaini Diary,  Vol.VII,  p.  133
 A.	For the last few years the Hindus have been presecuting such persons as became converts to Islam, by starting law-suits against them, thus giving vent to their resentment.
Q. Since when ?
 A.	The practice commenced some four or five years ago and some recent instances are: (1) a photographer's wife in Kohat, a Hindu woman in Tal, and a Hindu in Bhago, who were converted to Islam. (2) Then there was a case of a Hindu embracing Islam, or becoming a Sheikh and marrying a Mussalman woman, his subsequent reconversion to Hinduism, and institution of a law-suit in connection with the woman. (3) The filing of a suit by the Mussalmans in connection with a Mussalman girl, their failure  to obtain the desired sentence against the accused, the whole thing being followed by (a campaign of) litigation (against each other). (4) The securing by the Mussalmans of more than their due share of representation in social and political life and the starting of some Hindu organizations by some Hindu young men, etc. (are some other causes.)
Q. Is this (the last thing) also four or five years old?
A.	It happened within the last four or five years.
Q. Before the Khilafat movement or after?
A.	It commenced a year after the inauguration of the Khilafat movement.
Q.          Are conversions to Islam very frequent in Kohat district?
A.	Yes. There is a very large number of conversions in the district.
Q. What would be their approximate number?
 A.	Some conversion does take place in every Jumalibtech_266_footnotemosque. The total number of these conversions comes up to about one hundred or one hundred fifty every year, though all the cases do not necessarily belong to Kohat proper. On every Friday there are one or two cases of conversion.
Q. Are all the persons converted Hindus?
A.	They are all Hindus. Sometimes they are Sikhs also.
 Q.	Did anything else also happen before this, besides the pamphlet incident ?
 A.	There were some minor incidents relating to tanks, etc., but nothing happened affecting any large number of people except the incidents mentioned already. The affairs relating to the tanks, etc., were of a very restricted nature, but they gathered head and permeated the public outside.
Q. Did the interference of the Hindus, in the matter of coversions,
cause any resentment among the Mussalmans ?
 
 A.	Yes, it did cause resentment. There have been conversions of Hindus to Islam always, but the Hindus never took any notice of them. But Heaven knows what has happened today. They are raising a storm over it. After all, these people embrace Islam of their free will and for the love of it.
Q.	Are all these people who are converted to Islam of full age?
 A.	In cases where the parents accompany the children, the latter are  also converted. All the rest have attained maturity.
 Q.	Did ever any Mussalman tell the Hindus that they ought not to behave like this ?
 A.	Yes. They (the Hindus) were told so. I myself told them. But none of those to whom I spoke was a person of distinction or otherwise taking interest in public affairs.
Q.	Was this started before the shuddhi libtech_267_footnotemovement or after ?
 A.	This happened after the shuddhi movement. All these instances that I have mentioned happened after the shuddhi and sangathanlibtech_268_footnotemovements were started.
Q.	Do yo believe that this has any bearing on the disturbances ?
A.	There was ill will in the hearts already. This served as an additional excuse.
 Q.	Is this Muslim girl to whom you have referred the same as the one mentioned in connection with Sardar Makhan Singh’s son ?
A.	Yes. She is the same.
 Q.	What is your opinion about the pamphlet, what share had the general Hindu public in it ?
 A.	The pamphlet was sent for and sold here with the knowledge of the members of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha.
Q.	Are many Hindus members of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha ?
A.	I do not know their exact number.
Q.	Are Hindus in general, members of this Sabha ?
 A.	So far as I can think, there must be numerous (non-Sanatani ) Hindus as its members. About fifteen or sixteen members, whose names are often mentioned here for their fanaticism, belong to this class.
Q. Have you read the whole of this pamphlet ?
A.	I have read it through.
Q. Are all the poems in this pamphlet bad ?
A.	The poem coming just before the objectionable poem is very good. The
 
 remaining religious poems also are good, but song No. 11 is highly objectionable and calculated to severely shock the Muslim sentiment.
Q.	Were many copies of this poem sold ?
 A.	Copies of the pamphlet were seen in the hands of quite a large number of people, both Hindus and Mussalmans. The first copy which I saw was with Maulvi Ahmad Gullibtech_269_footnote. The second copy was with another Mussalman.
Q.	The Hindus say that not more than 30 or 35 copies were sold. Is
it true ?
A.	Maybe it is true, but I cannot say exactly.
 Q.	The members of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha apologized for the objectionable poem that was published. Was it not sufficient ?
 A.	I knew nothing about the apology till the deputationlibtech_270_footnotereturned from Peshawar. Nor have I even now seen the terms of that apology. I have heard that it was deemed insufficient by the Mussalmans.
Q.	Do you know in what respect it fell short?
A.	I have not seen its contents, so I can say nothing.
 Q.	Do you know that the page containing that poem was torn out or an the copies of the pamphlet?
A.	I have no knowledge of it.
 Q. Do you know  that  the  remaining  copies  were  sent  by  the Sanatan Dharma Sabha to the Deputy Commissioner and were burnt there?
A.	Yes. The remaining copies were sent to the court and burnt there.
Q. Was Jivandas, the publisher of the pamphlet, arrested ?
A.	Yes sir.
Q. Was the arrest of Jivandas not sufficient ?
 A.	So far as I am concerned, it was quite enough. When Jivandas was committed to custody, a promise regarding his prosecution was given and the remaining copies of the pamphlet were burnt.
Q.	Did this leave any room for complaint on the part of the Mussalmans ?
A	It ought not to have left any.
Q. Do you know when these copies were burnt ?
 
     failed   
 A.	On September 3rd 1924.
Q.	Do you know also that Jivandas was let off on bail ?
A.	I heard that Jivandas was let off; whether on bail or otherwise I do not know.
Q.	Was he sent out of Kohat and afterwards he was let off ?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did this make the Mussalmans indignant ?
 A.	Yes. The release of Jivandas, after the promise made by the Mussalman Deputy Commissioner that he would be prosecuted, inflamed the Mussalmans.
Q.	Was any meeting of the Mussalmans held on account of this ?
A.	I heard that the meeting was held on the night of September 8.
 Q.	Did the Mussalmans assemble in a large force and go to the Deputy Commissioner on the night of the 9th ?
A.	Yes Sir.
Q.	Were you present at this meeting ?
A.	I was given no notice of it.
 Q.	Did you come to know the facts about it only from hearsay reports ?
 A.	Yes Sir, I saw the crowd passing through the bazaar both on its way to and back from the Deputy Commissioner’s place. I saw it near the Town Hall as I was going to the bazaar.
Q.	What was the strength of the crowd ?
 A.	There must be about 1,500 men in crowd. There was hartal in the bazaar on September 9. The shops of the Hindus and Mussalmans were closed. Here and there some Sikhs were standing in front of their shops, having been compelled to open their shops.
Q.	When did this happen ?
 A.	I went to the town at 9 o’clock; when I returned at 11-30, all the shops were closed.
Q.	Did you see the crowd both the times, i.e., when it was going to
and when it was returning from D.C.’s place ?
 A.	I saw it both the times inside the Chhavani Darwazalibtech_271_footnotewhen it was returning and near the Town Hall when it was going out.
Q.	In which direction was the crowd proceeding ?
A.	It was going towards the Town Hall at 9 o’clock.
Q.	Did you talk to anyone from the crowd ?
 
 A.	Yes. I had some talk with some persons, while I was returning from the town.
 Q.	What was the nature of your conversations and what replies did you receive ?
 A.	I asked what the matter was and where they were going. They said that they were going to D.C. to ask why Jivandas had been released, and why he had betrayed his promise to them inasmuch as he had fixed the 11th as the date for the hearing of the case.
Q.	Was this all the talk you had ?
 A.	There were some other things also but they were more or less of this very nature.
Q.	Did you try to prevent them from this, and did your efforts have
any effect ?
 A.	I told them that at least we (Hindus and the Mussalmans) ought not to behave like this. By quarrelling among ourselves we give the third party (the Government) chance of interfering in our affairs. But my words had no effect upon them.
Q.	Have you any knowledge of the happenings on the 9th ?
 A.	I was in my house that day. I heard that there had been firing in the bazaar as a result of which a Mohammedan had been killed and that arson was going on.
Q.	Did you come to know all this from hearsay or did you see
these things yourself ?
 A.	I only heard about it but the flames and smoke could be seen and the reports of the firing could be heard.
 Q.	When you were in Kohat at about half past eleven and saw the crowd there, were any people from the villages present there ?
A.	No outsiders from the vilages were present in the town.
 Q.	Were there any people from the villages in the crowd at the Town Hall ?
A.	About 1/3 part consisted of the villagers.
Q.	Did you visit Kohat on the 10th September ?
 A.	On the evening of the 9th I sent a man of mine to the town to fetch some things for my friends and relatives. He brought back the news that peace had been restored in the city, that losses in lives of Mussalmans were heavier than those of the Hindus and that the fire in the bazaar was going on as before.
 On the 10th I motored through the school gate in my car. The Military had thrown a double cordon round the city wall. I obtained permission from the European Officer (in-charge) to enter the city. On reaching there, I found that perfect order prevailed. I saw several breaches in the city wall. As my motor reached the tahsil
 gate, I again heard the reports of firing. That day was an image of the doomsday (Kayamat ka namuna). This state of things continued from 10 o’clock to one o’clock.
 Q.	What do you mean by the image of the doomsday (Kayamat ka namuna) ?
 A.	I mean that anybody who fell into the hands of the mob was robbed and killed, the houses of the people were set on fire. The houses of both the Hindus and Mussalmans were burnt. The opportunity was seized upon for paying off all ancient grudges. All gentlemen took shelter behind closed doors for fear of their lives.
Q.	Did you return at one o’clock ?
 A.	I returned at 10·30. But I was witnessing this spectacle from the top of a hillock near my village.
Q.	You said you witnessed some horrible sights on the 9th ?
 A.	Yes, on the 9th I witnessed one or two incidents of unarmed Hindus being murdered.
Q.	Where did these murders take place ?
 A.	One of these incidents took place on the Shahi Road, i.e., Bhagi Kohat Road, the other on the Charouda side.
Q.	Were these people pedestrians ?
 A.	I afterwards learnt that one of them was proceeding in the  direction  of Pcshawar in a motor car and that he was taken out of this car and killed. I saw the corpse lying there.
Q.	Who killed him ?
 A.	I think it was the villagers from outside, who did not live in the vicinity of Kohat, because in the same car besides the Hindu gentleman there were two other Mussalmans one of whom was a nephew of Khan Bhadur Gulli Khan who had been in Kohat as an E. A. for several years. Had these people come from Kohat or the neighbouring villages they would have recognized the nephew of the Khan Bahadur or the nephew of the Khan Bahadur would have recognized them.
Q.	Who was the other Mussalman besides the Khan Bahadur’s
nephew ?
 A.	The other person was a professor of the Islamia College. Besides him, there was a driver, that is to say, there were three men in the car besides the driver, one of them being a Hindu who was killed.
Q. Were the three Mussalmans who were in the car with the Hindu
gentleman unable to save him ?
A.	These three could not save the Hindu because the assailants were so many.
Q. You mentioned another Hindu who was killed. Can you say
 anything about him ?
A.	I only saw his corpse lying in a field. I could not identify him.
Q.	Could you recognize the other Hindu who was killed first ?
 A.	As I had seen his corpse lying on the road, I inquired the facts about him on my way. I do not know how many hours his corpse had been lying there before I passed by.
Q.	Did you see any temples also that were burnt ?
 A.	After the Hindus had left for Rawalpindi I saw some portions of some temples burnt. One of these was the temple in mandi (market). The building adjoining it in which we sat for peace negotiations was also burnt.
Q.	Did you see any burnt Gurdwara also ?
 A.	We saw that the Gurdwara overlooking the springs was burnt. A few months ago, dispute between the Hindus and Mussalmans had arisen over this Gurdwara. The Hindus claimed it as a temple of theirs while the Sikhs contended that it was a Gurdwara and belonged to them. Some Hindu sadhus used to sit in this Gurdwara and smoke charas to which the Sikhs took strong objection. The Sikhs then came to the Gurdwara in force and ejected the sadhus from that place and took possession of it. As    a result, a Sub-Inspector of Police with some sergeants and a full body of police remained camped there for several weeks to prevent a disturbance as the Gurdwara was situated outside the city.
 Respectable leaders of both the communities were also made to deposit securities and bound over for peace and good behaviour. I myself gave a piece of land belonging to me opposite our cemetery to that sadhu. This sadhu declared that he would not leave that place till he had burnt that Gurdwara. During the riots this sadhu along with two respectable Hindu leaders who had taken refuge with him remained there for two days and besides risking his own life, protected the lives of two other Hindus. Afterwards I learnt that some Sikh gentlemen had reported to the police that the burning of the Gurdwara had been instigated by that sadhu. So the police expelled him from that place and sent him out of the district.
Q.	Did you see any other temples or Gurdwaras besides this Gurdwara that were burnt ?
 A.	I do not know (on being reminded, the witness admitted that Khan Jogran which was built mostly of wood had also been burnt).
Q.	Do you know how many Hindus and how many Mussalmans
were killed on the 9th and 10th ?
 A.	I do not know of any Hindu who was killed in the city on the night. Of Mussalmans, three were killed and three or four wounded. These included those boys also.
Q. Do you know the age of the child ?
 A.	I have heard that that child was about 10 or 11 years old.
Q.	Was anyone of them a child or were both of them children ?
 A.	Both were children—one of them was 10 or 11 years, the other one was a bit older.
Q.	Have you any knowledge of the casualties on the 10th Sep-
tember ?
 A.	All the rest of the casualties took place on the 10th September. Eight Mussalmans were killed. The number of wounded was greater. But the number of dead and wounded among the Hindus exceeded that of Mussalmans.
Q.	When did the Hindus from Kohat arrive in Rawalpindi ?
 A.	On the eleventh Rai Bahadur Mathuradas and Rai Bahadur Isherdas sent me word that they were putting up in the Commercial House and that I should take them to the railway station. I went there with two motor cars and in seven trips brought them and their relatives to the railway station. The Hindus lying in the Commercial House and by the roadside were in very sore straits. Their women folk also were sitting by the roadside in a very sad plight. The Government had made no arrangement whatever either for their accommodation or for removing them to the railway station.
Q.	When did they remove to the Commercial House ?
 A.	I learnt from them that they shifted to the Commercial House on the 10th September.
Q.	The Hindus state that between 9th and 10th September several
 Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam. Do you know  anything about it ?
 A.	I think no Hindu was forcibly converted to Islam. But some Hindus who had taken shelter with the Mussalmans, feeling that their lives were  in  danger, themselves requested that their tuft of hair, etc., might be removed and their  protectors, feeling that the lives of Hindus were really in danger, removed their chotilibtech_272_footnote & c., and gave out that they had become Mussalmans.
Q.	You had mentioned another procedure also ?
 A.	Something like that might have happened. Only I have no knowledge of any case when a Mussalman in order to save the life of a Hindu advised him to become a Mussalman and removed his choti. I can, however, believe an incident like this taking place.
 Q. Why do you believe it to be possible  that  some  Mussalmans  might have advised some Hindus to become Mussalmans to save their lives ?
 
 A.	Simply because the people from the villages were uneducated and protection of life was a serious matter.
Q.	Would you regard a person who has been converted to Islam in
this manner as a Mussalman ?
 A.	So long as such a person does not of his own free will declare himself to be a Mussalman in circumstances of peace, he cannot be regarded as a Mussalman.

   EXAMINATION OF AHMAD GUL ON KOHAT RIOTlibtech_273_footnote  
 [ RAWALPINDI]
 February 6, 1925
Q.	Your name, Maulvi Saheb?
A.	My name is Ahmad Gul.
Q.	What work are you employed in?
A.	I am a dentist.
Q.	Since when are you the Secretary of Khilafat?
A.	Since 1922.
Q.	Since when do you live in Kohat?
A.	I was born there.
Q.	In your opinion what is the cause of the Kohat troubles?
 A.	In some respects I agree with Pir Kamal Saheb, but in others I differ. In my opinion the cause of the disturbances was the pamphlet.
Q.	Any other cause, apart from the pamphlet?
 A.	There was another incident. In my life there were only two such occasions when the Mohammedans went to the Government in large numbers. One was the case of S. Makhan Singh’s son and the other of the pamphlet. Besides these occasions never has such excitement prevailed. Neither they collected nor was there any such disturbance.
 Q.	Do you take only these two incidents as the cause of disturbances?
A.	There were some mutual dissensions also.
Q.	What was the matter regarding S. Makhan Singh’s son?
A.	There was a general rumour among the people that S. Makhan Singh's son had
 
 illegitimate connection with the wife of his gardener. He went away to Lahore and the malanlibtech_274_footnotealso followed him and this was followed with a great stir among the people. The Pathans as a community look upon this kind of action with hatred even if it is done by a Mussalman. Therefore the Government also treats the accused severely and the people are disturbed thereby even if the case is between two Mussalmans. In the case of S. Makhan Singh's son the Government did not pay heed although  a deputation waited. I mean to say that the Sardar’s son was not convicted and the gardener did not get justice. It was a great shock to the Mussal-mans when a Hindu or a Sikh dared to do so. It was also rumoured that S. Makhan Singh pacified the gardener by giving some money. It was also broadcast that S. Makhan Singh saved himself on other occasion also by payments.
Q.	When did this occur?
 A.	It was about one year ago, i.e., one year before the pamphlet incident. When Jivandas was arrested and put into lock-up, S. Makhan Singh went to the jail in the capacity of a non-official visitor. The Jail Superintendent also complained against his conduct as a visitor as he interfered in jail arrangements. The Superintendent kept Jivandas in a solitary cell but the Sardar Saheb asked Jivandas to be taken out of it. There was a regular complaint about it as the daughter of Jivandas was betrothed to the Sardar's son. This rumour was also going round that Sardar Saheb would get Jivandas released in a few hours. After that when the first firing took place, the first thing that was heard was that the boys were killed before the house of Sardar Saheb. This was the past incident and again the release of Jivandas and the firing near Sardar Saheb's house excited the Mussalmans and in my opinion this is the reason  of  the  disturbance.
Q.	Who put out the rumour that Sardar Saheb and his son fired?
 A.	When I was in court and the crowd was being assured that Jivandas would be prosecuted, we had no complaint against other Hindus. The Mussalmans were satisfied when the court decided to proceed against the accused. The basis of the charge was being established, when the information reached there that firing took place in the bazaar. Ahmad Khan Saheb informed me and, taking me with him in motor car besides three other Mohammedans, proceeded to the scene of the occurrrence. We entered the city by the Cantonment gate and were yet fifty paces from Sardar Saheb's place when we met a crowd of fifty or sixty which came to stop us and said that firing was going on and we should not proceed further. One boy was lying killed near Sardar Makhan Singh's balakhanalibtech_275_footnoteand one man was wounded. On this the motor car was brought back to Kotwali without being turned as the space was not adequate. The Kotwali might be a hundred paces distance from there.
 
 Q.	Did you go there where the firing took place.
 A.	No, I did not. My companion and myself got down from the motor car and Ahmad Khan Saheb went back. When I was going to my house from Kotwali, shots were being fired from all sides at that time and some people
 also began to enter the city. In this fearful condition I went home as I was also indisposed. But later on I heard that the bazaar was being burnt and that three of the Mussalmans were killed and three were wounded.
Q.	Did you hear of any Hindus being killed or wounded at that
time?
 A.	I inquired about the Hindus also but no such case was reported to me. The night passed quietly.
Q.	When did it happen ?
A.	It was on the 9th September.
 Q.	When you were in the motor car and were informed of the firing, did Ahmad Khan Saheb also go there?
A.	Ahmad Khan Saheb did not go to the place of firing and went back.
Q.	When did you go to the bazaar?
A.	When I went with Ahmad Khan Saheb to the bazaar it was about half past one.
 Q.	You were mentioning some other matter besides this and before the Sardar Saheb's case?
A.	Those are ordinary things and are not worth mentioning here.
 Q. Pir Saheb said that since four or five years ago the Hindus were taking some steps in the cases of those converted to Islam and re- sorting to law-courts. This had shocked the Muslims. Do you also agree?
 A.	The village people might be of this idea as Pir Saheb has connection with people of the interior. He may be of that opinion but to my mind it cannot be so.
 Q.   Pir Saheb said that more than four years earlier the Hindus did  not care for those Hindus who were converted to Islam, and it was since then that they were resorting to courts. What is your opinion in the matter?
 A.	In this respect I differ from him. It happened only in the cases of converted women and not of men. It is a different thing where a Hindu becomes a Muslim and the Hindus try to take him back. All have religious liberty. As the Muslims are in majority in the Frontier, the Government cares exceptionally for the religious feelings of the Muslims. For instance, in other districts the meat prohibited for Muslims is sold in bazaars or it is openly taken in the bazaar but such has not been
 the case in Kohat up till now. But on the contrary the meat prohibited for Hindus is openly sold and used in the bazaar in the Frontier especially in Kohat.
Q. When did you hear about the pamphlet?
A.	I came to know of it on Friday the 29th August, when I was in the mosque.
Q. Who informed you ?
 A.	One volunteer named Gulam Ayub gave me the pamphlet after he had entered the mosque with a big crowd. He had with him such people also who did not enter the mosque on account of their clothes being unfit for entering and stayed out.
Q. What did the volunteer do?
 A.	He told me that there was a great row in the bazaar on account of this pamphlet and these people wished to consult the general Muslim public about it and take such steps by which people may be subdued.
Q.          What did you do again?
 A.	I took that book in my hand and from all sides people were asking me to read the poem in Pushtu which they had already heard; they wished to be acquainted with its subject-matter. I translated it before the crowd and also looking  to  their excitement and intention which I could guess I kept them back from resorting to any kind of disturbance and reminded them of the bad consequences of the riots in Malabar, Multan, Saharanpur and in other places and advised them that in case they could not control themselves they should go to the Government in this case also, as they were doing about other matters.
Q. You said that people wanted to hear what they had heard before;
why was it so when they had already heard?
A.	The crowd in the mosque said so, as some knew about it and others did not.
Q. But did it hear about it for the first time in the mosque?
A.	Yes.
Q. What happened later on?
 A.	They were whispering to each other after that and were plotting against the Khilafatists and were complaining that these people were lagging behind even in religious matters. ""They took thousands of rupees from us in subscriptions but when the time for the service of Islam has come, they hesitate."" They also said that on a previous occasion Pir Kamal Saheb and myself degraded the Mussalmans by taking bribe from S. Makhan Singh.
Q. What happened over the pamphlet after that ?
 A.	After that a letter from Sanatan Dharma Sabha came to me on 2nd September after Isha prayer, i.e., at about 9.30 p.m. in which Hindus had shown their excuse on behalf of the Hindus regarding the publication of the pamphlet. I took that letter with
 me on 3rd September to the mahallalibtech_276_footnoteof Parachgan where I had gone for condolence and where were collected people of different communities and read it to them and said that the members of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha convey their apology in those words. When I read the letter to them, instead of being satisfied with it, they felt the tone and method of the letter was. . .libtech_277_footnote; one of them expressed it thus, that when the soldiers were killed in the Great War and the King expressed his sorrow, this letter resembled the same. Neither there was any word of apology nor any such subject. After this the whole assembly went to the Superintendent of Police  and  the  Assistant Commissioner so that the accused could be proceeded against. The Deputy Commi- ssoner was at Usmana at that time. The Assistant Commissioner directed us to go to the court and he himself also went. The constables were sent to fetch Jivandas and he was brought into the room in our presence. After this the pamphlets were also sent for and Jivandas was put up in lock-up and the pamphlets were burnt there in the presence   of the A.C.
 Q.	You said you went for condolence and there you read the letter and this was not liked by them. Did the Hindus do anything also?
 A.	I came to know there that some people had decided with Hindus without my knowledge that according to the custom of this place the members of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha should come to a meeting to be held for this purpose as a jirga so that the matter be decided in consultation with the Ulemas.
 Q.	When the people said that the letter was not satisfactory, did you agree?
 A.	Looking to their attitude at that time, I did not think it advisable to give any kind of opinion and did not interfere.
Q.	But what was your opinion?
A.	My opinion was also the same. The letter did not smell of any apology.
 Q.	When Jivandas was arrested and the pamphlets were burnt, what was their number?
A.	I could not say, there might have been more than 500.
 Q.	Were you told that the objectionable poem had been taken out of it?
A.	Some such plea was put forward.
Q. The copies sent to the court were without that page?
A.	Some leaves were shown separately.
 
 Q. Was there a portrait of Krishnaji on that book?
 A.	Yes Sir.
Q. Did any Hindu object to it?
A.	No.
Q. Had anybody said so?
 A.	I would have been the first man to try to take out that leaf as there was no poem on it.
Q.	What about the Peshawar Deputation ?
 A.	On 4th September a deputation from Peshawar met me; after that  Sayid  Sikandar Shah Saheb came up fortunately. We were going to Pir Kamal Saheb, he met us on the way and we all went to a place near my house and talked about the matter. The Peshawar deputation and these two gentlemen tried to hush up the matter as far as they could, but the public excitement went high and everyone who tried to impose mild conditions or took up a mild attitude in this matter was suspected by the people.
Q.	Did you meet in the presence of the public?
 A.	The public had come at that time and they troubled me so much that no occasion of a private talk with the deputation was given to me. Had I done anything against their opinion the same condition would have been created as the people had created against other national leaders. I was forced to be with them, because had I also been cut off from them there was great danger of the situation being serious, but I can say this much that, on account of my being with them, the Muslims heard my advice and did not take the lead in the disturbances.
Q.	Were there Hindus also in that crowd at that time?
 A.	No, none. It is a different thing if there were any Sikhs standing there, as the Muslims had good opinion about them on account of their joining the Muslims on occasions of processions, etc. They could join in any meeting without any hindrance.
Q.	What did the people want and what did the Peshawar Deputation
do?
 A.	The public wanted that the Government should punish the accused in such a way that in future no Hindu should dare to publish such . . .libtech_278_footnotepamphlet. And the deputation wanted to decide the matter amongst ourselves as we were non-co-operaters and did not like to take the matters to the Government. The conditions which were arrived at with the deputation were these:
 
 
 That the matter be decided according to shrahlibtech_279_footnoteor according to the custom of the country; the members of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha could come to the Muslims as a jirga. The deputation including Saiyid Pir Kamal Saheb talked to the Hindus but when these gentlemen met me afterwards they expressed their failure on [sic] behalf of the Hindus.
Q.  Was Pandit Amir Chandlibtech_280_footnotelibtech_281_footnotealso there at that time?
 A.	Yes Sir. He was also there. When the deputation was talking to me about this matter in the presence of the public, he was hissed very much and Khilafatists also were cursed and it was rumoured about them that the Kohat Hindus had given ten thousand rupees as a bribe, therefore, these people not caring for our religious feelings were advising us to keep quiet on such an important matter.
Q. Pir Sahib said that the matter of jirga was not brought up in his
presence?
 (The previous statement of Maulvi Ahmad Gul was read to him and Saiyid Pir Kamal and others also explained the matter.)
Q. When the deputation, the Sayid Sahib and the Pir Sahib talked
together, what conditions did they decide to present to the Hindus?
 A.	We had ceased even talking with the Hindus as the Muslims felt annoyed. I asked the deputation to appease the public who were in religious colour [sic] at that time.
Q. What did you all think about the matter?
 A.	We were in that house for about an hour and a half. It was on the 5th September and not on the 4th. On the 4th I met only the Peshawar deputation who were my guests.
 Q. When you gathered on the 5th, what did you decide about the advice being given to the Hindus?
 A.	I decided that the case be handed over to the Government but the deputation did not wish it. At that time when the deputation and these two gentlemen met together nothing was decided.
Q. What did the people want?
 A.	The people wanted that the matter be handed over to the Government. The matter of shrah was also talked to the people. They would be very happy over it if the Hindus accepted.
 
 
 Q.	If the people were ready for both the alternatives, then what was the necessity of appeasing them?
 A.	It was on account of this, that they wish to take revenge themselves. I made them understand not to take the law into their own hands.
Q.	Who brought the people there?
 A.	The people came thems/ elves and suspected the deputation. When the matter of jirga came up Pir Saheb was not present at that time.
Q.	Were the Hindus told of the shrah and jirga?
 A.	I was not present there. Only the deputation talked to the Hindus and it came back with the reply that the Hindus did not accept either of the terms. A third term was also suggested by the deputation that the matter be handed over to the Khilafat, to which I replied that the Khilafat could not decide the matter as it had gone into the hands of the general public.
Q.	What happened after 5th September?
 A.	The deputation went back to Peshawar on the 6th September. We all were under the impression that Jivandas was in lock-up and that he would be proceeded against.
 Q.	Was there any excitement in Kohat on the 6th and 7th September?
 A.	There was nothing of the kind on those days. Ordinary business was going on normally.
Q.	At what time was Jivandas released on the 8th September?
 A.	On that day I had gone to Churqota and was away from 4 p.m. when Mian Fazal Shah and Mian Rahmat Ullah were with me. I returned from there after the prayers of Magrablibtech_282_footnote. On my way to Kohat, I met some village people bringing their necessaries. They told me, “You are here. Jivandas has been released and there is so much uneasiness prevailing in the city. People are gathering in the mosque of Hazrat Haji Bahadur.” On this I went to the mosque. It was about 8.45 p.m. at that time. I saw a crowd in and outside the mosque which went protesting against the action of the D.C. in releasing Jivandas before the fixed date, the 11th September. I went inside the mosque and inquired what they wanted. They replied, “The Government does not care for our religious feelings.” We also protested against those who advised the release of Jivandas. This charge was against some of my friends also. This I contradicted and advised the crowd that we will go to the D.C. on the 9th September and would inquire from him what good he thought would come by releasing Jivandas before time, and I asked the people to go to their homes and they went away. It was about half past ten or eleven that they left. Some time we spent in prayer also.
 
 Q. Was there much excitement among the crowd?
A.	Yes.
 Q.	You said that they were so very angry that they did not listen to you and then you said that you argued with them and made them understand that they would have justice and said, “If we failed, then you could do anything you liked.”
 A.	Yes. Once the Hindus boycotted the Muslims and did not buy meat and vegetables from them. On this I posted pickets for two days on Hindu shops, which resulted in Hindu halwais ,libtech_283_footnotesweets being let unsold. It was about two years ago. In fact  I did boycott the Hindus. Had the Hindus not given up this atitude I would have recommended this method to the Muslims.
Q. Did the Muslims take oath of boycott in the meeting?
A.	It is altogether wrong.
Q. And was there no talk of burning and looting?
A..	Not at all.
Q. What happened on 9th September?
A.	I approached the D.C. at the ground near the Town Hall with the people.
Q. What was the number of people with you?
A.	About 2,000.
 Q. Were there village people in the crowd?
A. People of the village within the Municipality were there.
Q. Were not the people of far off places there?
A.	Not of very far off places.
Q. What did you do then?
 A.	We gathered in the open and the D.C. went inside the Town Hall. The officers, etc., were also there. They called me inside, but the people in the crowd said that they would hear the talk in the open.
Q. Were you the leader of the deputation?
 A.	Yes. I was the leader. And according to their wishes I also said that we should talk in the open. At last the D.C. with other officers came out and addressing the crowd asked who would talk with him. All unanimously proposed my name. I talked to the D.C. and asked why he released Jivandas before time. “This has excited the people, now you should talk to them and subdue their excitement.” He replied that he
 
 
 
 had released him on bail with this idea that perhaps a large number of people would come on the appointed date, and the accused might be put to trouble. I said, “You did what you were to do, but now the demand of the people is that the one guilty of the pamphlet be hauled up and this can be only if some proceedings commenced in their presence to satisfy them.” This was consented to by the D.C. and he told the Assistant Commissioner to take Jivandas’s case in his own hands and commence the proceedings. After this the whole crowd reached the court as I have said before.
Q.	Was the order for the D.C. conveyed to the crowd?
 A.	Whatever was being told by the D. C. in reply to my talk, I conveyed to the crowd at the same time. At the end I told the crowd, “The D.C. has accepted your demand.” After this some dispersed and those from outside went to their homes. By outside, I mean villages nearby in municipal area; and some went to the court.
Q.	Were there bamboos or axes in the hands of these people?
 A.	Some people had hand-sticks and some had bamboo-sticks. One or two of them had axes according to the custom of that place. The people use this in the Frontier as a pleasure.
Q. Was there no gun with anybody?
A.	No gun. Had there been any, the D.C. would not come into the crowd.
Q. When did it end?
A.	This ended at 12 noon.
Q. You went in motor car at half past one.
 A.	Yes.
Q. Is the garden of S. Makhan Singh outside the city?
A.	It is near the court.
Q. Was it burnt on that date?
 A.	I came to know later on that on the first day the children plucked the fruits of the garden and destroyed much of it and spoiled small plants also. On the second or third day, it was also heard by me that the house in the garden was burnt.
Q.	The Hindus say that this house was burnt on the 9th?
A.	To my knowledge this house was not burnt on the 9th. I am fully satisfied.
Q.	Was looting and burning commenced in Kohat on the 9th?
 A.	It was commenced in the bazaar. It was all right when I left. The houses of Hindus and Muslims were burnt and looted.
Q. Did you remain within your house on the 9th?
A.	I did not stir out. People were coming to me and giving news.
 Q.	Up to what time did looting and burning go on on the 9th?
 A.	I believe the bazaar was burnt within two hours on the 9th. The flames were coming up in the night. Even on the second day the smoke was coming out. On the same occasion I heard looting was going on.
Q. When did the fire commence?
A.	I was told that the flames of fire were seen at half past two.
 —Ended at 12·30 p.m.
Commenced at 6·30 p.m.
 Q.   You said that you heard the news of firing in the court on the   9th and on this you came in motor car? Did you see yourself or did you hear from where the shot came?
 A.	I did not see. Neither did I see the children killed. I was told at that time that the shot came from the upper storey of Sardar Saheb as a result of which one child died and one man was wounded.
Q.	Did you make any investigation about it?
A.	No.
Q.	Do you still believe that Sardar Saheb fired?
 A.	People told me so, that Sardar Saheb fired. Some said that a man was killed near the tahsil. Others said that it was he who died first.
Q.	Did he die by Sardar Makhan Singh’s shot?
 A.	I heard this.
Q.	It was such a big thing and yet you did not make inquiries?
 A.	I did not inquire about anything. Nothing occurred to me. I was in such a condition of mind at that time that I was not able to form any opinion.
 Q.	What kind of relations were there between you and  Sardar Sahib?
A.	My relations with all Hindus have been friendly and with Sardar Saheb also.
Q.	Was it not your duty to inquire from Sardar Saheb?
 A.	The condition was such that I could not reach him; I could neither form an opinion nor make any inquiry.
Q.	When your relations with the Hindus have been good, did you
 think over the matter why all the Hindus whom I have seen think that you are the cause of all these troubles?
 A.	I myself have not been able to solve this mystery why they have formed such an opinion about me. There are some people to whom I went and for whose protection I arranged and I tried to bring about peace.Even then I have not been able to
 understand the cause and even now I fail to find out the cause of being blamed.
Q.	Did you protect their womenfolk?
 A.	Many of them came into a compound. There was one beggar woman or whose purdah I arranged. Men were taken to Hujra and all the women to a big house with some men. This is what happened on 10th September at 3 p.m. The Muslims in my mahalla secured certificates from the Hindus whom they protected but I did not do even that.
Q.	Can you recognize the Hindus whom you helped?
 A.	I helped many people including women. I recognize L. Ramji Mal. There was one Ladha Ram and also Pir Sahib of Than.
 Question was put to L. Ramji Mal if he was there. He answered that B. Ahmad Khan was a friend of his father. ‘‘There were other Mussalmans also with whom we had good relations. I asked Maulvi Ahmed Gul if he could make some arrangements. He kept silent, but other Muslims said to him, ‘Maulvi, let bygones be bygones, and the matter be ended now.’ Other Mussalmans asked us what we wanted. They took out our children and we lived in the house of B. Ahmad Khan. On my return I said to M. Ahmad Gul, ‘The Muslims are looting our houses because there is no one there.’ On this, he replied, ‘You should go to the Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner who would make arrangement.’
Q.	You say that other Muslim brethren gave refuge on the 10th ?
 A.	Yes. In Jungle Khel, in Gari Muwaz Khan, Mahalla Mian Badshi Mian Khelan, Mahalla Pir Sayat-ul-Am, also Dr. Gulam Sadiq.
 Question was put by S. Gurdit Singh: ‘‘When Maulana Saheb came in Kotwali on the 10th I told him how much ruin has taken place, to which he replied that that was the scene of Vishnu’s temple. Was it so?’’
A.	Yes, I said so.
Q.	Did all the Hindus go to cantonment on the 10th?
 A.	Some went because I myself went with three or four groups. The volunteers were sent for protection to all places. There may be one or two instances in which Hindus suffered. I could not say. The Hindus were taken, out from their houses and brought to Thana and handed over to the Government.
Q.	What do you mean by handing over to the Government?
 A.	The authorities ordered that those who stayed behind and were safe be gathered  in Thana. D. C. told me and the police also. I said that there were some in my house.
Q.	Did the D. C. leave the management in your hands?
 A.	There was no particular management in my hands which the authorities could do, excepting that I would give them men, so that when people would enter the city from outside they could be recognized or if anybody would go out, it would be known
 that the man was not a suspicious character. There was Police and border [sic] with the volunteers also.
Q.	Were you working with the D. C. or the Government?
 A.	I co-operated with them so far as by not doing so there would have been not much trouble to the people [sic].
Q. Are you a member of the Working Committee?
A.	Yes.
Q. Are there Khilafatists on the Working Committee?
A.	Four or five Khilafat workers are there.
Q.          Who is the Chairman of the W. C.?
A.	Nawabzada Bag Mohd. Khan, rais libtech_284_footnoteof Tiri.
Q. Those who are with you here, are any of them members of the
W. C.?
 A.	Now there are two sections of the W. C. The Khans of the city who belong to Kohat Tahsil form one party, whom the other party of city people do not recognize. There is one of my companions a member of the W. C. My connection is with the city people.
Q.	What connection has the W. C. got with the Government?
 A.	It has no special connection with the Government. It was founded only to give relief to distressed Muslims and to arrange for the conduct of cases. In fact it was formed to arrange for a reconciliation with the Hindus. But if it could not be effected, then the Muslims would be helped in their cases.
Q.	The settlement arrived at now, was it done by W. C.?
 A.	The members went to Peshawar many times but there was no settle- ment. When the Hindus went to Kohat, at that time open talk took place and terms of settlement were reached and both the parties signed them. The signatures were put down by those also who were outsiders, which means those who had gone out of the W.C.
Q.	When negotiations were going on at Peshawar, were you there?
A.	I always went to Peshawar with the W. C.
 Q.	How   many   members   of   the    deputation   were   present	at Peshawar?
A.	Sometimes six, at other times 12 or 15.
Q. Were you the spokesman there?
 
 A.	Either Nawab Sahib or Pir Sahib worked as spokesman as occasion arose, and sometimes I also talked. As I did not know English, I could not take more part in it.
Q.	Who is the Secretary of the W. C.?
A.	Now Sheikh Abdul Rahman is the Secretary.
Q.	Do you consider the last settlement a forced choice?
 A.	I could not say it was such. The officials described it as one beneficial for both the Hindus and the Muslims.
Q.	Do you consider it a settlement free from all kinds of pressure?
 A.	I would have considered it as free if there had been no hand of any Government man. It was a settlement made under fear.
Q.	Were the Muslims also put in jail before they were made to sign
the settlement?
 A.	No, but the members of the Hindu deputation were put in jail and then their signatures were taken on the settlement. The conditions arrived at would not have been better between the Hindus and Muslims in my opinion whoever would have done  it, as these were settled after full discussion. The discussion took place between the members of the Hindu and Muslim deputations and [the terms] were agreed upon unanimously.
Q.	Why do you say so, that there could not be better terms?
 A.	Because conditions were such. Jivandas was released and we felt helpless. Because of the way in which he approached the people we could not say anything in his favour; he was guilty before God. When he did not obey the Shariatlibtech_285_footnotehe was handed over to the court as we could not help it; we feared the Ulemas.
Q.	Had all the Muslims demanded the release of Jivandas, would
the Government still detain him?
 A.	The Government said that they would take up the case against him. I could not say the Government would let him go if the Muslims agreed.
Q.	Why was such a restriction placed regarding the Gurdwara?
Could not the Sikhs expect something better from the Muslims?
 A.	They could not expect anything better as there were many mosques nearby. According to old records, the Sikhs could not construct it. It would have demolished itself. One mosque was erected near it and it fell of itself. I agreed on their behalf that the Sikhs must be given the same status as before the 9th. The condition of the cutcha wall was made because the public did not like the first condition.
Q.	What became of looting and burning after the 10th?
A.	Firing was going on the 10th but no looting and burning took place after that.
 
 Q.	Could you give any estimate of proportion of losses of Hindus?
A.	I could not tell.
Q.	Was the loss of the Hindus greater?
A.	Surely the Hindus suffered more.
Q.	Is the booty or loot to be found in the villages or Kohat?
 A.	I could not say about it that some goods like cloth were recovered and they are deposited in the Tahsil by the authorities. I could not say if the goods were in Kohat. They must have gone into villages.
Q.	Do you agree with Pir Saheb regarding the change of faith? Was
there any such incident on the 9th and 10th?
A.	I agree with him. It took place in those days as Pir Saheb said.
 Q.	Are you of the same opinion that every year 100 or 150 conversions take place?
 A.	I do not agree with the number. To my mind the number is 40 in a year on the average and in this people from outside are also included.
Q.	Are you of the same opinion as Pir Saheb regarding conversion
of women?
 A.	If no pressure has been used in the case of a woman. If she accepts Islam under pressure, the Muslims are forced to let her go to her Hindu husband.
Q.	If the court decides in favour of the Hindu husband, would the
Muslims still not return the woman?
 A.	No, the Muslims would not agree to it and will consider her connection with her Hindu husband illegitimate.
Q.	Can the Muslims conceal the woman or adopt some other
method about it?
 A.	It will be the duty of the Muslims not to let the woman go to her Hindu husband, as her bond with her Hindu husband is broken as soon as she accepts Islam.
Q.	How can the Hindus go back to Kohat?
 A.	When they would agree to two conditions. First they would not publish such a pamphlet and they would not fire as they fired. If they would accept [these terms] they could go at any time they liked; there is no danger. I see no reason for any disturbance in future if they would give up such injurious methods. The Muslims’ attitude will be all right if these people are careful.
Q.	Should they accept both of these conditions?
A.	We did not fix any conditions before nor do we now.
Q.	I would therefore ask you what they should do?
 A.	I don’t fix any condition. They can come without any conditions.
Q.	If I would seek your advice, what would you  suggest?
 A.	I would advise them to go to their places, but they should take the Frontier into account and mind the temperament of the Pathans.
 Q.	Is the atmosphere of Kohat such that Hindus cannot live in Kohat honourably?
 A.	I have not seen such conditions nor heard it that their living there honourably is difficult.
 (At this stage S. Makhan Singh said that the treatment meted out to Hindus was not the same as before.)
Q.	To Hindus! Why so much said against the Maulvi Sahib?
A.	Individually there is no complaint against him.
 Q. (by S. Gurdit Singh) Was the apology considered in your presence when the apology was thought over by the Santan Dharma Sabha on the 2nd September? Were you there at that time?
 A.	I was not there, I came to know only when I got the letter. There was no mention of apology.
 Q.	(by M. Shaukat Ali) Did you come to know or try to know if any invitation for looting was given to the Muslims of the city or of outside on the 8th or before that?
A.	No.
 Q.	Had there been any such movement or others would have done so, was it possible that the matter would not have come to your notice?
A.	Had there been any such plot or movement, I would have got the news anyhow.
Q.	Was the incident of 9th a pre-arranged one or accidental?
A.	There was no arrangement by the Muslims, at least I had no idea at all.
 Q.	Do you know that any Khilafat worker or volunteer took part in burning or looting of Hindu houses?
A.	No.
 Q.	Did they put fire to any bazaar or take part in looting or in exciting the people for it?
A.	No, I don’t think.
Q.	How many volunteers are there?
A.	There are 14 or 15 volunteers nowadays.
Q.	Did any of them take part in it?
A.	It was put into my ears, but I could not say that they did it.
 Q.	You non-co-operated when the Khilafat declared it; when did you commence co-operating?
 A.	I worked with my volunteers only [in some things] in which the Government authorities took part, so that people be not put to trouble.
Q.	Did you go to the D. C. before that and ask his help?
 A.	Once when I joined the Anjuman one year ago, I had to go to the D.C. about the Anjuman School. Since the Khilafat commenced, besides this occasion I did not go to the D.C.
Q.	What troubles arose that you gave up your principle?
 A.	People were suspecting the workers that they would not hear anybody. They trusted me alone. If I had gone out then, such people would have entered the field and it would have been more troublesome.
Q.	Since when did you begin to mix with the officials?
 A.	I commenced since the pamphlet matter and it was not officially. Since I joined the Khilafat I had given up co-operation.
Q.	Do your enquiries make you believe the Muslim lad was killed by the first shot?
A.	Yes, on hearing of the same shot I went to bazaar.
 Q.	Had there been no such accident, the disturbances would not have occurred. Do you believe it?
A.	Certainly not.
Q.	(by Maulana Shaukat Ali) Did the volunteers take part in looting?
A.	I could not swear about it that no volunteers took part.
Q.	Did you hear anything about it?
A.	I heard much about it, I don’t think that any Muslim took part in loot.
 Q.	Did the Khilafatists take part in looting and burning the shops and troubling the Hindus?
 A.	I could not swear about it. I have heard complaints that the Muslims did so. (Pir Sahib said none was free from it. Khilafat volunteers were also in it .)
Q.	Did you hear that the Khilafat volunteers took part in looting ?
 A.	Yes, I heard.
Q.	Were the Khilafat volunteers sent out with a message to bring outsiders for loot?
A.	I have no knowledge.

   TELEGRAM  TO  MADAN 		 MOHAN  MALAVIYAlibtech_286_footnote  
 February 7, 1925
  PANDIT 	MALAVIYAJI 	BIRLA 	HOUSE DELHI REACHING	DELHI	TOMORROW 	MORNING BHATINDA MAIL.     From 	a handwritten draft: S.N. 2456           GANDHI 
        TO	KATHIAWARIS    	In a few days I shall be again in Kathiawar, and that, too, in 	Rajkot this time. Shri Bharucha has been so much impressed by 	Kathiawar that he has asked for permission to prolong his stay there 	and propagate the spinning-wheel movement . I hope that the usual 	remark about our being enthusiastic merely in the beginning will not 	be proved true in this case. If the political leaders of Rajkot 	decide, they can infuse new life in Rajkot as also in other parts of 	Kathiawar. “In other parts”, because Rajkot is the central place 	and, as it is the headquarters of the (Political) Agency also, 	political workers foregather there. No one can say that politicians 	are pressed for time, and they have sufficient influence over the 	people. They can make the whole of Kathiawar khadi-minded, 	revitalize it and check the exodus of Kathiawaris for a few pounds 	of bajrilibtech_287_footnote. 	We shall not understand how the problem will be solved in this way, 	by asking the question what a person can earn through the 	spinning-wheel; we shall be convinced that it can be, if we 	calculate how much money the people will save. If we only think how 	much everyone will suffer by the increase of a pie in a rupee in the 	salt tax, we shall see no reason to be seriously upset. But when we 	calculate the total revenue yielded by this impost, we shall be 	astounded by the figures. Loss of this kind is like a prick by the 	cobbler’s needle. It is felt by the society as a whole. We can 	deduce from this the effect on every individual. Similar 	is the case with the spinning-wheel. Suppose that in     
 every home spinning brings half an anna every day. That will amount to twelve rupees at the end of a year. And if we assume that there are five persons in every home, then, 2,600,000 ÷ 5 = 520,000 ¥ 12 = 6,240,000, that will be the figure of rupees saved for Kathiawar. Let us do another calculation. Assuming that for every person in the population of 2,600,000 on the average five rupee are spent every year on cloth, Kathiawar uses cloth worth Rs. 13,000,000. If we deduct from this sum one-third as representing the cost of cotton, then Kathiawar will be saving Rs. 9,000,000.
 What a glow of fresh life would the people of Kathiawar feel if they found that they were exempted to the tune of nine million rupees from the levy which they have to pay to the Bombay Government annually! If we give up counting the benefit to each of us individually, we would understand the invisible gains or losses in which we share. I expect the people of Katihawar to count the collective gain or loos. If Kathiawar does that today, the rest of India will follow suit. If we merely ask, “What will it profit to me?” Our conclusion  will  be absurd and ruinours. Activities beneficial to society will be undertaken when we learn to ask: “How will this benefit the people?” If every person thought of his own gain, all would be ruined. When all seek the benefit of all, that is, collective welfare, the whole society and every members of it would benefit.
 If the Kathiawaris think on these lines, they will realize the miracle which the spinning-wheel can work. And I hope to receive from them a balance—sheet drawn on these lines of work done in this month. Did those who took the pledge to spin do the spinning every day? Have those who did not know spinning learnt it? Has the cotton for which an appeal was addressed to the people been collected ? If it has been, has any plan been drawn up regarding its disposal? The Executive Committee and the individual workers will have to answer these and many other similar questions.
 I expect of Rajkot, too, a similar—balance sheet of work done. Preparations are under way there for honouring me. What need is there to honour me? If the people think, however, that they ought to honour me, they can do so by raising a pile of yarn before me and by every person adorning himself in Khadi. I can take no pleasure in high—sounding epithets. I shall be undertaking this my second visit to Kathiawar in the hope of being able to propagate the cause of Khadi and spinning, for serving the Antyajas, the people and the
 
 Rulers.
 I shall be opening a national school at Rajkot. I believe that sincere workers have been giving their services for it. The Gujarat Provincial Committee has donated liberally towards its establishment. His Highness the Thakore Saheb has given land at a low price. I wish that the citizens of Rajkot should take interest in this school. They should watch it, correct any mistakes it may be making and, if it has men of character on its staff, help it by sending their children to it. It is but proper the Rajkot itself should shoulder the burden of its expenses.
 This time my tour of Kathiawar will include a visit to Wadhawan. I shall give a few hours to the town for the sake of the national school there. Great sacrifices have been made for its sake. I have heard of much criticism against it, too. Clouds have gathered over it, and cleared. Some Khadi work has been done in the town. It is, again, a town which claims Motilal as its citizen. It has enjoyed the benefit of Shivlal’s enterprising spirit and wealth. I will expect many things from this town. I am sure it will not disappoint me.
 I wish that, instead of wasting their time and resources on honouring me, people at every place which I visit should think of utilizing my services. I request the workers to see that my time and that of the public is not wasted in useless speeches. May I claim a right to beg that, wherever a meeting is organized as being unavoidable, every man and woman attending it will be clad in khadi?

   MAHARAJA OF MYSORE  
 His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore has taken up spinning. This news cannot but gladden the hearts of those who look upon it as  a sacred duty? The correspondent reporting this news also adds that this development has followed Sir Prabhashanker Pattani taking up spinning. We need not get elated on hearing of these instances. Even so, they draw attention to the nature and extent of the power which lies in spinning. Moreover, the example of eminent men is bound to have an effect on the common people. I congratulate the Maharaja of Mysore and hope that he will not give up till the end of his life this activity which he has taken up. It will do immense good to him and
 his subjects. Its immediate benefit may seem insignificant, but I have no doubt that it will ultimately grow into an impressive giant tree. The work of spinning will become a golden link binding the Maharaja and his subject. This will revive the rule that princes should engage themselves in useful work which is calculated to benefit the subjects, the knowledge that even the work done by the poorest among the subjects has a place in the palace of the Maharaja will always act as an inspiration to the people, and it will be established that in reality there is no distinction of class between the prince and the poor. Such results do not follow from a few days’ work. They require continuous and regular work, done with complete faith.

   TRUE EDUCATION  
 The following letter of Dr. Sumant Mehta came into my hands only during my recent journey to Delhi. For one thing, during tours I do not receive my post regularly and, for another, even if letters are received in time my secretary cannot look into them immediately. After he has seen them, he passes on to me those needing immediate attention, and I can look into them as and when I find time. This naturally entails delays. Had I received Dr. Sumant Mehta’s letter in proper time, I would have made use of it during the convocation.libtech_288_footnoteThat occasion was missed. I, therefore, discuss the letter here. It reads as follows:libtech_289_footnote
 I welcome this letter. In fact, Acharya Gidwanilibtech_290_footnotehad acted on the idea underlying the main suggestion made in it. That is, snatakaslibtech_291_footnote were posted at various places for special service and contact was maintained with them. This practice was not a part of the curriculum but was followed in individual cases and on an experimental basis.
 
 The doctor proposes, and rightly, that it should be made a permanent feature and included in the curriculum itself. The letter seems  to  imply that the doctor intends his scheme to be adopted in place of the present scheme of studies.
 Personally, I might like even that; there is, however, no need to completely replace the present scheme, and even if there be, it is not possible to do so. We had in mind the students’ inclinations when framing it. In comparison with other provinces, Gujarat felt the spirit of service a little late. Every student, therefore, will not be eager for a course of studies essential for training in service. Moreover, along with the needs of social service we have to pay attention to the problem of livelihood. The prevailing idea is that education is intended to equip the student with the means of livelihood. If the aim were no more than this, it could be excused, but there is also the idea that education should help the student to make money or to get appointed to a position of authority. As long as this attitude does not change, our curriculum is bound to remain defective from a theoretical point of view. I think it impossible to change it immediately. But it is essential, and quite possible, gradually to reduce the idea of career to secondary importance.
 The Vidyapith also will have to create for the students fields of social service which can offer them means of livelihood. Livelihood may not be the aim of education, but the ability to earn it must be one of the fruits of education. The aim of education is spiritual development, and where this is achieved, the ability to make a living is bound to follow.
 It is also noted that students are not happy unless they acquire a knowledge of English. They also crave for a knowledge of literature. There can be no harm at all in either. We have only to guard against making a fetish of them, against making the study of English and of literature the sole aims of education and forms of self-indulgence. In their right place, which they occupy at present, they are of great value.
 It cannot be maintained that the curriculum of the Government colleges is in every respect harmful. I do not feel that all of it deserves to be kept out. Its features of parrot-learning, prohibition of the use of the mother tongue, grand display of the knowledge of English, one- sided study of history, almost complete indifference to our ancient culture, absence of training in self-control, all these and similar features must be guarded against.
 I, therefore, believe that there is considerable room for improvement in the present curriculum of the Vidyapith. But this is sooner said than done. Who will effect the improvement? There is none among its workers who is rich in the experience of life. Those who are in charge of formulating the curriculum are products of Government colleges. Some of them may have been disillusioned about those colleges, but how can we expect them to have a new vision and experience of new methods? Hence the defects in the curriculum of national education. The heads of all institutions have tried to effect what improvements they could and their efforts have met with some measure of success.
 Now a word about Dr. Sumant Mehta’s suggestion. I agree that the programme of studies embodied in his proposal deserves to be implemented. Some of the subjects suggested therein can be introduced in the early stages of the course in the Mahavidyalaya. Some others can be taught even in the pre-Mahavidyalaya stage. Yet some others seem to be such as might be taught after the general studies are completed. I invite Dr. Sumant Mehta to prepare his plan of study in detail. I could have done this even by writing a letter to him. The reason for writing about the subject here is to induce the teachers and the students to think about it, discuss it and also help Dr. Sumant Mehta. We have very few persons who can think. And even those we have are busy each in his own field of work. This position is becoming normal day by day, as is proper that it should. If everyone were to dabble in every subject, he would do justice neither to the subject nor to himself. Unless each one of usselects his own field of work and works with single-minded devotion in that, we shall never achieve our goal. The task of implementing the plan will have to be accepted by the Doctor himself. Thoughtful teachers and social  workers who take interest in academic matters may assist him. My role was to bring them and him together and, to an extent, express my own views. The doctor has retired to Petlad for one year, and he has an opportunity there or experimenting with his scheme. It will be easy for him, therefore, to elaborate it.
 When it is fully developed, the scheme will require teachers who can implement it, but that is a separate problem. I am sure that we shall get them when the need for them arises.

   KOHAT HINDUS  
 
 [February 9, 1925]
 I know that the pages of this week’s Young India will  be searched for the finding of Maulana Shaukat Ali and myself on the tragedy of last September. I am sorry to disappoint the curious. For Maulana Shaukat Ali is not with me and I must not publish anything without his first seeing it. I may, however, tell the reader that I have already discussed my impressions with Pandit Motilalji, then Pandit Malaviyaji and lastly with Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khanlibtech_292_footnotelibtech_293_footnote,  Dr. Ansari and the Ali brothers, and I have justlibtech_294_footnotefinished writing them out during my journey to Sabarmati. My notes will be immediately forwarded to Maulana Shaukat Ali and I shall hope to publish themlibtech_295_footnotetogether with Maulana Shaukat Ali’s endorsement, addition, or amendment as the case may be. But apart from the finding, I am in a position to reiterate my advice to the Hindus that in their place I should not return to Kohat unless there is an honourable peace with the Mussalmans without the Government Intervention. This is not possible at the present moment. For unfortunately, the Muslim Working Committee which is at present guiding the Mussalmans of Kohat was not and would not be represented before us. I can appreciate the delicate position of the Hindus. They do not want to lose their property. The Maulana Saheb and I have failed to bring about peace. We have failed even to draw the principal Mussalmans for a discussion. Nor am I in a position to say that we should succeed in our attempt in the near future. In the circumstances the Hindus are at liberty to take any course they may consider advisable. In spite of our failure, I can only advise one course. “Don’t return till the Mussalmans take you to Kohat with self-respect and dignity.” But I know that this is cold comfort except for those who are able to stand on their own legs and are in need of no advice from any quarter whatsoever. Such is not the position of the Kohat refugees. I have conveyed my views to Pandit Malaviyaji. He has been their guide from the beginning and they must act as he advises them. Lalaji came to Pindi but he was unfortunately laid up in bed. My own considered opinion is given in the statement
 
   1921      
 sent to Maulana Shaukat Ali. But I confess in advance that it will bring no solace to them. I am but a broken reed not worth relying upon.
 But there is no hesitation about my advice regarding what the refugees should do whilst they are outside Kohat. I cannot help remarking that it is demoralizing for men and women  who  have strong arms and legs and who are otherwise physically fit, to subsist on charity. They must find out some occupation for themselves or with the aid of the local men. I have suggested carding, spinning and even weaving. But they may do any other useful work they choose or that may be chosen for them. The idea is that no person, man or woman, who is physically fit should live on charity. There must be always enough occupation in a well-ordered State for all who are willing to work. The refugees must be able to give a good account of every minute of their time whilst they are being supported by the nation. “Idle hands some mischief still will ever find to do” is not a mere schoolboy rhyme. It contains a profound truth which can be verified by everyone for himself. Let there be no distinction between rich and poor, high and low. They are all bed-fellows in adver-sity. And the rich and the well-to-do should set an example to the others by labouring usefully even though they may not be drawing rations.
 What an incalculable good it must be to a nation  whose  members know an occupation which can stand them in good stead in distress. The refugees’ life would have taken a nobler turn if they had all been spinners or carders or weavers. The refugees’ camp would then have presented the appearance of a busy hive and could have been kept up indefinitely. If the men do not decide to return at once, it is not yet too late to mend. It is a mistake to issue dry rations. It is no doubt less trouble to the committee of management but it means more waste and utter indiscipline among the refugees. They should place themselves under soldiers, discipline keeping regular hours for rising, washing, praying, feeding, working and retiring. There is no reason why there should not be Ramayana readings or such other readings for them. All this requires thought, care, attention and diligence. Given these the calamity could be turned into a blessing in disguise.

   LETTER TO SIR PRABHASHANKER PATTANI  
 Maha Vad 2 [February 10, 1925]
SUGNA BHAISHRI,
 I returned from Rawalpindi yesterday. Today I got your letter for which I was waiting. I could not resist sending a telegram conveying my thanks. Please do not be angry with the person who wrote to me. I shall try to let you know his name also. On reading that you do not consider any letter as wholly confidential, I have begun to feel more proud of mankind. I feel humbled. I thought that I was perhaps the only persons who had nothing private of confidential. You have surpassed me, because you are living in an environment where it would be difficult to publicize one’s private life. Had the writer been a schemer or a wicked man, I would have written nothing to you from his letter, nor would I have allowed it to influence me in the least. But he is a gentleman, discrimination, disciplined  and learned. He cannot possibly have any malice towards you; but I can well understand how he came to commit this mistake. I am sending him a copy of your letter. It will do him good. He is such a pure- minded person that I wouldn’t be surprised if he came to you and offered his apology. I did well in writing the letter to you. You recollect your past lapses; but who is free from these? I have been saved thrice from falling. It was not owing to my own strength but owing to my unlettered mother. She bound her son by the thread of a vow and he was saved.
 I shall reach Rajkot on the 16th. Shall we meet there or any where else?

   SPEECH AT SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, SABARMATI  
 February 10, 1925
 I am in the predicament of a man who having come to know that there is a serpent under his mattress shakes the matters vigoro- usly, sweeps the room and washes the floor with water. I have come to know what I did not know earlier about the situation in Kohat. I talk to you about it because it is a matter concerning religion. We all have to take this as a warning. It does not mean that we have  to  do something special and novel; but we have to prepare ourselves  mentally and emotionally. We have to become purer.
 At this stage Gandhiji referred to the number of conversions in Kohat and
 said:   That number may 	possibly be considered as small elsewhere. In 
  	an area were Muslims barely number 15,000, this is terrible. The 	Hindus there work up and the Muslims could not tolerate the 	awakening; those looking for a chance to wreak vengeance found it in 	the form of that booklet. If that was the only reason, the  man 	concerned could have been arrested, he could have been crushed, and 	perhaps all those connected with the booklet could have been 	crushed. But here the whole community was persecuted. Its cause must 	be deep-seated. I found that cause quite by chance. The Muslims said 	many things frankly about proselytization. But that activity has 	hurt me very much. I would not mind it at all if 30 crores of Hindus 	became Muslims as a result of scriptural studies and  rational 	arguments. Then I would be the single Hindu left and thereby I would 	add lustre to Hinduism. Or I would adduce proof of the immortality 	of Hinduism and say that the others became Muslims because they 	could not bear the brilliance of Hinduism. But if people turned 	Muslims out of greed or fear, as it happened there, I could not 	endure it. I am talking about this matter because I am to make you 	strong of mind, in order that you may be more attached to dharma. 	Despite this, 
 there will be no change in my non-violent behaviour, my attitude of love and in my behaviour towards Muslims. The more I see their weaknesses, the more shall I serve them. My love for them will  certainly endure. But the language of love will change—it has become more firm and will become firmer still—just as my words to Englishmen are becoming stiffer. That will be the only difference. My sole object is to rouse you this morning and to caution you. I want to caution you because you may sometimes face a similar situation. If any little boy or girl in the Ashram is kidnapped, you should not just look on, interpreting my non-violence in a superficial way. The determination to be pure is itself a source of strength. A man having a pure and unsullied heart has no need to develop his body. His body automatically becomes strong. And thereafter mere resolve is enough. It is my resolve that I would utter the name of Rama before retiring, so that without chanting the name I can never get sleep. And if I do get it, I utter Ramanama while turning on my side and I do see my standing near me. The same true of every resolve.
 Even a child in the Ashram is not afraid if he faces danger. If he does not have strength of soul, he surely has nails. We clip nails becuase dirt accumulates in them. When they grow big they get in the way and we clip them. In like manner, we should go on removing the dangerous elements in the body one by one.

     [PS.]       Glad to know that you 	are quite well.  Yours,  MOHANDAS 	GANDHI 
  From 	the Hindi original: C.W. 6104. Courtesy: G.D. Birla      SPEECH AT ANKLAV    February 	11, 1925  	Swaraj is there where the poorest of the poor can live happily. It 	is we who have not known hunger that are responsible for famine. A 	hundred years ago women of this village used to spin and men used to 	spin or else to weave.  	The Dharalas have some bad habits. They drink liquor and 	commit thefts. As long as these things persist, religion is not 	safe. Unfortunately Hindus and Muslims here keep reviling each 	other. One’s religion should be dear to oneself, but if 	untouchability is a     
 part of Hinduism, I will have none of it. Even if a man has bathed and washed off his filth, we believe that still we cannot touch him—this attitude is sinful. The people of India are the Dheds and Bhangis  of the world. A man has to answer for his deeds. It is not the adult of the British that we are slaves. The tree of slavery has grown from the seed of untouchability in our midst.

   SPEECH AT BORSAD  
 
 February 11, 1925 Borsad has become a place of pilgrimage, thanks to the satyagraha struggle. But the holy places in India are no longer holy,
and I hope this has not become the fate of Borsad. Your struggle and
 the success you achieved in it were no ordinary ones. But to fight a battle is one thing, and to follow it up with constructive work  is  another. One discovers that to reap happy benefits from one’s success is a difficult matter,and it often seems as if the struggle had never been fought. To return to the normal conditions after a struggle is as difficult as after a prolonged fast. We discovered this even after the Kheda agitation, and feel it after the present struggle. We saw the same thing, on a wider scale in Europe. There, a great War was fought between Britain and Germany; colossal sacrifices were made and we had expected to see a new Europe as a result of these, expected to see its people more moral and pure, wiser and more godfearing. But the evil ways which prevailed there persist even today, and the people who made the sacrifices are in an unhappy plight. Let us hope that the difference in the manner of fighting that War and our struggle will be reflected in thier repsective outcomes. In the War in Europe, the two sides fought to destroy each other. In a satyagraha struggle, neither side is destroyed, but on the contrary both benefit. How does it happen, then, that we do not see the desired result at the end of even such a pure struggle as satyagraha? The reason is just this, that we find excitement to be a common feature of the two kinds of fighting. We are not able to maintain an atmosphere of peace and show patience, as we should, and so we seem to lose the gain we have made. About Borsad, however, the Durbar Saheb had forewarned me that he would not be able to show me Khadinagar, that the struggle had not taught
 the people the value of khadi. I did not, therefore, come here with any high hopes and so I am not very much disappointed either.
 Even running a school requires considerable ability. The aphorism, as in one’s body so in the universe, holds true on all occasions. If I can conduct the Satyagraha Ashram well, I can succeed even in Lord Reading’s seat. The difficulties I have to face Ashram, the anxious thought I have to bestow and the number of problems I have to solve, I do not have to in a struggle like yours. What after all is to be done in running a campaign? I have to chalk out a programme and tell you what to do, merely give instructions to people; running an Ashram is much more difficult that this. I have no aspiration to be a Viceroy even in this life; I only wish to be a devoted servant of the country. But I beg leave to say that running an Ashram taxes one’s spiritual resources more agonizingly than discharging the duties of a Viceroy ever does. You, too, I wish, should tax yourselves in like manner in running the Vidya Mandir, or the more one suffers the purer one becomes.

   SPEECH AT BHADRANlibtech_311_footnote  
 
 February 11, 1925
 Before I thank you for your love and the address you have presented to me, I have one request to make. You have assembled here in such a large number at this late hour of the night. I would be guilty of a crime against you if I did not say that this makes me happy. But there is also something else which pains me. I do not know if the organizers of the meeting deliberately made the arrangements which we find here, but by now everyone who attends such meetings knows my idiosyncrasies. One of these is that I am extremely paimed to see at a meeting a separate enclosure for Antyajas, and find it impossible to start my speech. But, as you have said, and many others besides you say, non-violence is the central creed guiding my life, and I am trying to act every moment in accordance with it. If what you have said is true, I can never wish to give you pain. I would not like you to do anything without knowing its implications, nor can I get angry with
 
 you and force you to do anything. Whatever I wish you to do, I should persuade you to do by touching your heart and reason. I, therefore, appeal to you to join me in wishing, if you believe that the practice of untouchability is a blot on Hinduism, that the wall which separates our Antyaja brethren from us should be demolished.
 I do not mean that you should demolish that wall this very moment, or do anything that may create a disturbance in this meeting.  I only want to ask you whether you agree with me. Do you wish that this wall should disappear and that our Antyaja sisters and brothers should take their seats with us?libtech_312_footnotelibtech_313_footnoteIt is only now that you have presented me an address. The manner in which you have framed your address and the fact of its being printed on [hand-made] paper or, maybe khadi, can have no value in my eyes, or only as much as you give by your daily conduct. The address, however, which you have presented to me this moment by removing the fencing [separating the Antyajas from the rest of the audience] will ever remain inscribed in my heart. I beg for another address like this from my Hindu sisters and brothers. I would not be pleased by your giving me a little yarn, or offering me flowers and fruits of various kinds and bringing an Antyaja girl to place a tilak on my forehead (as was done here). These I may have anywhere. But the gift you have made me just now should be accompanied with the chain of love; I want nothing less than that, for love is a part of non-violence, is comprehended in it.
 My Sanatanilibtech_314_footnotefriends should not please believe that I wish to strike a blow at Hindu society. I count myself as a sanatani. I know that my claim will be accepted by few, but that is my claim and I will continue to make it. I have said again and again that people are sure to admit, if not today after my death, that Gandhi was a sanatani Hindu. Sanatani means that which goes back to ancient times. My ideals are of this kind, that is, I find them in the oldest of books and try to live up to them; I am, therefore, justified in claiming myself to be a sanatani. I would not accept people as sanatanis merely because they can recite the Shastras in a beautiful manner. Those  alone  deserve to be called sanatani who have the spirit of Hinduism in every fibre of their being. The revered Shankara summarized that spirit in
 
 
 one sentence:  Brahma satyam jaganmithya.libtech_315_footnotelibtech_316_footnoteAnother sage declared that there is no higher dharma than truth, and still another that Hinduism means perfect non-violence. You may accept any one of these three statements, and you will get the essence of Hinduism. They represent the very cream of the holy books of Hinduism, and I who claim to follow dharma as defined by them simply cannot wish to hurt anyone. I merely want you to mix with Antyajas, for they are also human beings. I want that we should serve them for they deserve our service. They render to society service which a mother gives to her child. To look upon them as untouchables and to despise  them amounts to forgotting our humanity. Indians have become the pariahs of the world in this age because they look upon countless numbers of human beings as untouchables. This has resulted in the Muslims, too, being treated as untouchables, because of their association with us. What is the cause of this unhappy state of affairs? There is only one answer: “Reap as you sow” is a divine law. There is nothing mysterious in the fact that, through the world, God is dealing us this justice. It is perfect justice we are getting. “As men worship me, so I give   myself   to   them”libtech_317_footnotelibtech_318_footnote,   so   said   Shri   Krishna.   If,   therefore,   you understand what I want from you, you will not be pained. I am not out to give pain to people. I am not asking too much from you. I have never asked you to enter into marriage ties with Antyajas or eat in their company. That is a matter of your own choice. But you cannot claim that to regard them as untouchables is also a matter of your choice. It cannot be a matter of your choice to avoid contact where you should not and not avoid if where you should. If you do not see the sufferings of Antyajas, how can you say sarvam khalvidam Brahmalibtech_319_footnote? The author of that Upanishad was not hypocrite since he has ascertained that this entire universe in Brahman; we should be worse than brutes if we do not suffer when we see others suffer. Our dharma declares in the most emphatic terms that the brute, too, has a soul just as we have, but we have in this age distorted the teaching of that religion, Akhalibtech_320_footnotedescribed this idea [of anyone being defiled by the touch of another human being] as a superfluous limb. You should discard it, cut it off. I want you to destroy this evil of untouchability
 
 by arousing in you compassion and love, or, if you would have it so, a sense of brotherhood. If we end it, we shall win glory for Hinduism and will have saved it. I do not mean that Antyajas will then stop embracing Islam or Christianity. No religion depends for its survival on the numerical strength of its followers. There has been no more fallacious idea than that the strength of a religion depends on the number of those who profess it. Even if but one person remains a true Hindu, Hinduism will not perish; if, on the other hand, the crores of Hindus in the country adopt the ways of hypocrisy and evil, Hinduism will not live long but is certain to be destroyed. When I say Hinduism will be saved, I mean that we shall have atoned for our errors, paid the debt of centuries and escaped bankruptcy.
 There is no doubt that the practice of untouchability is inspired by hatred. If anyone claims that he bears love for Antyajas though treating them as untouchables, I will not believe him. I see no evidence of love whatsoever in this practice. If we bore love for them, we would not add-ress them insultingly, would not throw at them our left-overs; if we had love for them, we would hold them in reverence as we do our mothers, would provide them better wells and schools than what we ourselves have, and permit them to visit temples. All these would be indications of love. Love shines with the light of countless suns. If one little sun cannot be hidden, how can love remain so? Does a mother ever have to declare that she loves her child? An infant which cannot even speak looks at its mother’s eyes and, as their eyes meet, we see something mysterious passing between them.
 Because I say this, let no one believe that a Hindu returned from South Africa with reformist ideas wants to impose his ideas on Hinduism. I can truthfully say that I entertain no ambition  of reforming other people. I am a selfish man, immersed in my own joy.  I seek my own spiritual welfare, and that is why I have been able to detach myself from everything and can live in complete peace. But I want you to feel the joy which I do and, therefore, ask you to welcome contact with Antyajas, to serve them and experience the happiness which you will get by doing so.
 We can but garland the bride and the bridegroom. What more can we desire than to see them bound with the chain of love? What more can a person wish for than that he or she should be united to another who will be his for her life’s partner? Anyone who desires more than this has no right to marry. I would not like anyone to
 
 marry in slavish obedience to rigid custom. If a girl faced with such a harsh necessity resolves to remain unmarried for her whole life and lead a life of self-sacrifice and voluntary suffering, if, like Uma, she takes a vow that she would marry only if she got a husband like Siva, she is bound to get such a husband, if not in this life in the next. Such  a woman will be an ornament to her whole community. The purpose of marriage is not self-indulgence, but self-control. I want all people to understand this idea.

   LEAVES FROM A DIARYlibtech_321_footnote  
 Misses Angus and Hindsley were sent from Adyar to the  Ashram by Dr. Besant to learn carding, spinning, etc., so as to be able to train others at Adyar. They passed a month at the Ashram and kept a diary of their daily experiences. On their departure they left relevant notes from their diary for publication in these pages. On first reading I thought I could not well publish them as they appeared to me to be too personal. The next thought was to cut out the personal references and then publish them. But on re-reading, I have decided to present the notes without a single alteration. I have stood the strain of personal reference now for a long time. I can very well bear the additional strain. There is a merit in the notes which compels publication. The references to the Ashram are not wholly true. All is not so rosy as it has appeared to these friends. The Ashram has its jars, it has its trials and difficulties, it has to wear away many a rough edge. But it does try to live up to its name. There are certainly things about the Ashram which can be copied with safety. But I must warn the reader against being carried away by some of the flattering description, and applying for admission. There is a standing notice from the Manager to me that he has more inmates than he can take care of and more work than he can cope with. Let those  who like  the way of the life described by Misses Angus and Hindsley copy it wherever they may be.

 There was a meeting of the Bihar P.C.C. . . The programme for the whole year is  to  secure at least 13,000 self-spinning members.	The P.C.C.
 proposes this year to produce khaddar worth at least five lacs of rupees. The present monthly production is Rs. 13,000. If they are to manufacture five lacs, the monthly production must be trebled. Rajendra Babulibtech_324_footnoteis enthusiastic about it.       The people here are anxiously looking forward to your visit. If you can
 come, the work will certainly receive a great push.
 I hope that the other provinces too will lose no time in preparing their programme of work. I should love to go to Bihar as early as I can. But I am not master of my own movements. I go where fate takes me. It is therefore futile for me to make promises in advance.
 AT CAWNPORE
Dr. Abdussamad writes:libtech_325_footnote
 Cawnpore was a scene of disturbance on the 2nd of this month and, as it is the venue of the next Congress, I think it is just proper that you may know the truth of the affair and if the statement is corroborated by Dr. Morarilal, the President of the local Congress Committee, I hope you will publish the whole or a part of it in your paper Young India. . . .
I have not written to Dr. Morarilal for confirmation of Dr.
 Abdussamad’s statement as on the face of it, it appears to  be colourless and innocent. If Dr. Morarilal has a different version of the incident related, I would gladly publish it. Quarrels will sometimes take place in best regulated societies but the spirit that prompted the parties after the incident seems to have been admirable. As for the charge against “a section of Arya Samajists” I do not know how far they will admit it. I can only hope that every section in Cawnpore will try its best to exercise the greatest self-restraint, keep under control the mischievous element and be ever ready to be charitable to rivals who may hold different political views or different faiths.
 A SILENT WORKER
A Chittagong correspondent sends me the following story of a
 
 
 silent worker:
 Sreejut Kalisanker Chakrabartee, a silent but indefatigable worker of Chittagong, has, of late, arranged practical demonstrations of charkha. He does not believe in wordy battles. He personally approaches four families every morning with his big charkha, spins before them by way of giving first lesson and begs of them their contributions. The process may seem futile to some, but the melodious sound and sweet music of the charkha, preceded by the recitation of a prayer in the early hours of the day, wonderfully conquers the sceptic who orders a good charkha and promises due contributions. Uncompromising unbelievers who sneered at the charkha are daily won over. The business-like promptitude with which Kalisanker Babu is progressing, ensures success. He has set an example to other workers who may if they choose copy it with profit to themselves and the country.
I have taken the liberty of condensing the letter and making its
 English readable. I commend the letter to the attention of all workers. There is no doubt that example is better than precept.

   A REVOLUTIONARY’S DEFENCE  
 A correspondent, who has given his name but not his address, has sent me what he calls “an open letter”. It is a letter in reply to my remarkslibtech_326_footnoteon the revoluntionary movement in my address to the Belgaum Congress. The letter breathes love of the country, fervour and a spirit of self-sacrifice. It is moreover written under a sense of wrong, said to have been done by me to the  revolutionaries.  I  therefore gladly print the letter without the name. The address of the writer is not given. The following is the unchanged full text of the letter:libtech_327_footnote
 I think it my duty to remind you of the promiselibtech_328_footnoteyou made some time back that you would retire from the political field at the time when the revolutionaries will once more emerge from their silence and enter into the Indian political arena. The experiment with the non-violent non co-operation movement is now over. You wanted one complete year for your experiment, but the experiment lasted at least four complete years, if not five, and still do
 
 you mean to say that the experiment was not tried long enough?
 You are one of the greatest of personalities in the present age and under your direct guidance and inspiration, your programme was actually taken up for some reason or other by the best men in the land. Thousands of young men, the flower of the youth of our country, embraced your cult with all the enthusiasm they could gather.       Sacrifice and sincerity on the part of your
 followers were not wanting.	You wanted one crore of rupees and you  got
 more than you wanted.	still do you mean to say that the experiment was
 not tried far enough? . . .
 To say that non-violent non-co-operation failed because the people were not sufficiently non-violent is to argue like a lawyer and not like a prophet. The people could not be more non-violent than they were during the last few years. . . .
 Non-violent non-co-operation movement failed not because there was sporadic outburst of suppressed feelings here and there but because the movement was lacking in a worthy ideal. The ideal that you preached was not in keeping with Indian culture and traditions. It savoured of imitation.       It
 was not the spirit of kshamalibtech_329_footnoteof the Indian rishis, it was not the spirit of ahimsa of the great Indian yogis. It was an imperfect physical mixture of Tolstoyism and Buddhism and not a chemical mixture of East and West. You adopted the Western methods of Congress and Conferences and tried  to persuade the whole nation to accept the spirit of ahimsa, irrespective of deshlibtech_330_footnote, kallibtech_331_footnoteand patralibtech_332_footnotelike Tolstoy, but which was a matter of individual sadhanalibtech_333_footnotewith the Indians. And above all, you were and are still vague as regards India’s ultimate political goal. This is miserable. Your idea of independence is not in consistence with Indian ideals. India stands for sarvam paravasham dukhham sarvam atmavasham sukhamlibtech_334_footnoteand for the ideal that individual existence is solely for the purpose of humanity and through humanity serving God. Jagat- hitaya Srikrishnaya chalibtech_335_footnote. The non-violence that India preaches is not non- violence for the sake of non-violence, but non- violence for the good of humanity, and when this good for humanity will demand violence and bloodshed, India will not hesitate to shed blood just in the same way as a surgical operation necessitates the shedding of blood. To an ideal  Indian,
 
 violence or non-violence has the same significance provided they ultimately do good to humanity. Vinashaya cha dushkritalibtech_336_footnotewas not spoken in vain.
 To my mind therefore, the ideal that you gave to the nation or the programme of action that you laid before it is neither consistent with Indian culture nor practicable as a political programme.
 It is simply inconceivable and incomprehensible to think that you still dare to entertain the slightest hope that England can be just and generous out of her free will—this England “which believes in Jallianwala Bagh massacres as a legitimate means of self-defence”, this England which tried the O’Dwyer- Nair case and gave judgment in favour of barbarism. If you have an iota of faith left in you in the good sense of the British Government, then according to you where is the necessity of any programme at all? . . . A sovereign independent Indian Republic is alliance or in federation with the other independent nations of the earth is one thing, and self-governing India within this imperialistic British Empire is perfectly another thing. Your sentiment of remaining within the British Empire reminds one of the many Himalayan miscalcualtions that you have repeatedly commited. It seems to me that you have compromised a worthy ideal with the present needs of a false expediency and this is the reason that you have failed to capture the imagination of the youths of the country— youths who could dare and who are still daring to go against your wishes although they unhesitatingly recognize you as one of the greatest of personalities of the modern age. These are the Indian revolutionaries. They have now decided to remain silent no more and therefore they request you to retire from the political field or else to direct the political movement in a way so that it may be a help and not a hindrance to the revolutionary movement. . .
 . Further, I would like to point out that you have misjudged the revolutionaries
 in many respects when you blamed them in your recent presidential address in the 39th Congress. You said that the revolutionaries are retarding India’s progress. I do not know what you mean by this word “progress”. If you means political progress then can you deny that every political progress that India has already made, however little that might be, has been made chiefly by the sacrifices and the efforts of the revoluntionary party? Can you deny that the Bengal partition was annulled through the efforts of the  Bengal revolutionaries? Can you doubt that the Morely-Minto reform was the outcome of the Indian revolutionary movement? Can you be blind to the forces of this revolutionary movement which was mainly though not wholly instrumental in bringing about the Montford reforms? . . . .
 If you mean that these reforms are no index to true progress, then I would
 
 venture to say that this revolutionary movement has achieved  no  mean progress in the moral advancement of India. Indians were miserably afraid of death and this revolutionary party once more made the Indians realize the grandeur and the beauty that lie in dying for a noble cause. The revolutionaries have once again demonstrated that death has a certain charm and is not always a dreadful thing. To die for one’s own beliefs and convictions, to die in the consciousness that by so dying one is serving God in the nation, to accept death or to risk one’s life when there is every probability of death, for a cause which one honestly believes to be just and legitimate—is this no moral progress? . . .
 You have said to the revolutionaries, “You may not care for your own lives, but you dare not disregard those of your countrymen who have no desire to die a martyr’s death.” But the revolutionaries are at a sad loss to understand the meaning of this sentence. Do you mean to say that the revolutionaries are responsible for the deaths of 70 men who were condemned in the Chauri Chaura trial? Do you mean to say that the revolutionaries are responsible for the bombing and killing of innocent people at Jallianwala Bagh and Gujranwala? Did the revolutionaries during their struggle for the last twenty years, in the past or in the present, ever asked the starving millions to take part in the revolutionary struggle? The revolutionaries have perhaps a better knowledge of the mass psychology than most of the present leaders. And this was the reason that they never wanted to deal with the masses until they became sure of their own strength. They always believed that the masses of Northern India were ready for any emergency and they were also right in thinking the Northern India mass as a dense matter of high explosive, dangerous to be handled carelessly. It was you and your lieutenants who misjudged the sentiment of the masses and dragged them into the satyagraha movement, people who were groaning under a thousand oppresions from within and without, where the lightning of anger laid unperceived and you had to pay the penalty for it. But can you give any instance where the revolutionaries dragged unwilling souls into the valley of death?
 But if you mean by the sentence that innocent people are being harassed, imprisoned and put to death due to the activities of the revolutionaries, then I would unhesitatingly and honestly admit, as far as my knowledge goes, that not a single individual was hanged who was innocent of any revolutionary activity, and about imprisonments and tortures, I may say that many innocent men were actually harassed and put to torture. But can the revolutionary party be made responsible for the atrocities committed by a foreign government? The foreign government to determined to crush any manifestation of manhood in the nation, in any form whatsoever; but in so
 crushing, the government is very liable to commit blunders and harass and imprison and put to torture cowards along with the heroes; but are the brave people to be blamed for the sufferings of the cowards? Moreover these  sufferings cannot be termed as martyrs’ death.
 Lastly, I would like to say something about the remarks you have made in connection with the strength of the British Empire. You have said to the revoluntionaries: “Those whom you seek to depose are better armed and infinitely better organized than you are.” But is it not shameful that a handful of Englishmen are able to rule India, not by the free consent of the Indian people but by the force of the sword? And if the English can be well-armed and well-organized why can the Indians be not better armed and better organized still—Indians who are saturated with the high principles of spirituality? Indians are men in the same sense as the Englishmen are. Then, what on earth makes the Indians so helpless as to think that they can never be better organized than their English masters? By what argument and logic of fact can you disprove the possibilites in which the revolutionaries have immense faith? And the spirit of non-violence that arises out of this sense of helplessness and despair can never be the non-violence of the strong, the non- violence of the Indian rishis. This is tamaslibtech_337_footnotelibtech_338_footnotepure and simple?
 Excuse me Mahatmaji, if I am severe in criticizing your philosophy and principles. You have criticized the revolutionaries most unsympatheti- cally and even you went so for as to describe them as the enemies of the
 country, simply because they differ from your views and methods. You preach tolerance but you have been violently intolerant in your criticisms of the revolutionaries. The revolutionaries have risked their everything to serve their motherland, and if you cannot help them, at least be not intolerant towards them.
 I never made any promise to anybody as to when and how I should retire from the political life of the country. But I did say and now repeat that I would certainly retire if I find that India does not imbibe my message and that India wants a  bloody  revolution.  I should have no part in that movement because I do not believe in its utility either for India, or, which is the same thing, for the world.
 I do believe that there was a wonderful response to the call of non-co-operation but I do also believe the success was more than proportionate to the measure of non-co-operation. The wonderful awakening of the masses is a standing demonstration of the fact.
 
 I do believe too, that the country exercised great self-restraint; but I must reiterate my opinion that the observance of non-violence was far below the required standard.
 I do not believe that “my philosophy” is an indifferent mixture of Tolstoy and Buddha. I do not know what it is except that it is what I feel to be true. It sustains me. I owe much to Tolstoy and much to Buddha. I still somehow or other fancy that “my philosophy” represents the true meaning of the teaching of the Gita. I may be totally mistaken. Such a mistake can do no harm either to me or to anybody. For the source of my inspiration is of no consequence if what I stand for be unadul-terated truth.
 Let the philosophy I represent be tested on its own merits. I hold that the world is sick of armed rebellions. I hold too that whatever may be true of other countries, a bloody revolution will not succeed in India. The masses will not respond. A movement in which masses have no active part can do no good to them. A successful bloody revolution can only mean further misery for the masses. For it would be still foreign rule for them. The non-violence I teach is active non- violence of the strongest. But the weekest can partake in it without becoming weaker. They can only be the stronger for having been in it. The masses are far bolder today than they ever were. A non violent struggle necessarily involves construction on a mass scale. It cannot therefore lead to tamas or darkness or inertia. It means a quickening of the national life. That movement is still going on silently, almost imperceptibly but none the less surely.
 I do not deny the revolutionary’s heroism and sacrifice. But heroism and sacrifice in a bad cause are so much waste of splendid energy and hurt the good cause by drawing away attention from it by the glamour of the misused heroism and sacrifice in a bad cause.
 I am not ashamed to stand erect before the heroic and self- sacrificing revolutionary because I am able to pit an equal measure of non-violent men’s heroism and sacrifice untarnished by the blood of the innocent. Self-sacrifice of one innocent man is a million times more potent than the sacrifice of million men who die in the act of killing others. The willing sacrifice of the innocent is the most powerful retort to insolent tyranny that has yet been conceived by
 God or man.
 I invite the attention of the revolutionaries to the three great hindrances to swaraj—the incomplete spread of the spinning-wheel, the discord between Hindus and Mussalmans and the inhuman ban upon the suppressed classes. I ask them patiently to take their due share in this work of patient construction. It may not be spectacular enough. But on that very account it requires all the heroic patience, silent and sustained effort and self-effacement of which the tallest among the revolutionaries is capable. Impatience will blur the revolutionary’s vision and lead him astray. Slow and inglorious self- imposed starvation among the starving masses is every time more heroic than the death of the scaffold under false exaltation.
 All criticism is not intolerance. I have criticized the revoluti- onary because I have felt for him. He has the same right to hold me to be in error as I believe him to be in error.
 There are other points that are covered by the “open letter”. But I have omitted to refer to them because I think that they can be easily answered by the reader and in no case do they touch the vital issue.

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO SEVA MANDAL 		ADDRESS, BHADRAN  
 February 12, 1925
 I have been asked to say something about brahmacharyalibtech_342_footnote. This is one of those subjects on which I write in Navajivan from time to time. I rarely speak on it, because I think that it is an extremely difficult subject to talk about and one cannot explain one’s ideas about it in a speech. You wish to hear my views on ordinary brahmacharya and not on brahmacharya in the extended definition of the term which connotes the control of all organs of sense. Even ordinary brahmacharya is said by the Shastras to be very difficult to observe. Permit me to say that there is ninety-nine per cent truth in this view, but that it falls short of absolute truth by one per cent. The observance of this ordinary brahmacharya is felt to be difficult because we do not strive to control the other organs of sense. The most important of these is the palate. For him who has learnt to  control the palate. The observance of brahmacharya will be easy enough. Students of zoology tell us that lower creatures observe brahmacharya better than man. What they say is true, and if we try to know the reason we shall discover that the lower creatures have the completest control over the palate, which is not the result of an effort of will but is instinctive. They feed on grass and plants, and eat only as much as would satisfy their hunger. They eat to live, and do not live to eat. We do quite the opposite of this. The mother feeds her child all manner of delicacies, believing that only so can she express her love. By acting in this way, we do not make our food more tasty, but rather less so. Food is made tasty by appetite. A plain rotlalibtech_343_footnoteis more tasty to a hungry person than ladulibtech_344_footnotecan be to a person who has no appetite. We actually use all kinds  of  spices  and  prepare  an   endless   variety  of
 
 
 dishes so that we may be able to load our stomachs to the full, and then we ask why we cannot observe brahmacharya. We let our eyes, which God has given us for seeing things, be tainted with lust, and do not learn to observe what we ought to. Whyshould a mother not learn the Gayatri and teach it to her child? It would be enough if, without going into its deeper meaning, she merely understands that it is an invocation to the Sun-god and teaches the child to worship the Sun. Sanatanists and Arya Samajists, both may worship the Sun. In explaining the Gayatri as worship of the Sun, I have given its most obvious meaning. What is the meaning of this worship? It means that, holding up our heads and looking at the Sun we should cleanse our eyes. The author of the Gayatri was a rishi, a seer. He tells us that nowhere shall we find anything to equal the drama of sunrise or see beauty and mystery like its. There is no  sutradharalibtech_345_footnoteas skilled as God and no stage grander than the sky. But which mother ever asks her child to look at the sky, for fear that the child might hurt its eyes? Her mind is filled with all manner of worldly thoughts; the education which they give in that big building, she perhaps tells herself, will make her child a well-paid officer. Does she ever ask herself, however, how much the child benefits from what it learns, consciously or unconsiously, from the atmosphere in the home? Parents paid their children with clothes till they feel suffocated, try to make them look smart and handsome, but do the children really look so? Clothes are meant to cover the body, not to beautify it; they are meant to protect us against heat and cold. We should ask a child shivering with cold to go and warm itself at the stove, or sun in the street or go and work on the farm; then alone can we help it build a body as strong as steel. Anyone who has observed brahmacharya ought to have a body of such strength. We, on the contrary, ruin children’s bodies. We wish to keep them within the four walls of the home and make them comfortable. This produces a kind of artificial heat in their skin which we can only compare to eczema. We have ruined our bodies by pampering them overmuch, we have been playing with fire.
 So much about clothes. Then, through the things we talk about in the home we produce harmful effects on a child’s mind. We talk about marrying the boy or the girl, and the things which the child sees around it have much the same effect on its mind. What surprises me is that we have not yet become the most uncivilized people on the earth. Despite everything calculated to destroy decent social restraints, they have survived. God has so made man that, though placed again and
 
 again in circumstances which might tempt him to evil, he comes out safe—so profound is His mystery. If we eliminate all such factors which increase the difficulties in the way of brahmacharya, we would find it quite easy to observe.
 Though this is our condition, we wish to oppose others with physical force. Than are two ways in which we can make ourselves fit to do this, a lower and a higher. The lower way is to cultivate strength of body by any means whatever, by eating and drinking anything which may serve our purpose, training ourselves for physical fighting, eating beef, and so on . When I was a boy, a friend used to tell me that we ought to eat meat, that if we did not we would never be as strong and stout as Englishmen. The poet Narmadashankerlibtech_346_footnotelibtech_347_footnotealso gave this advice in a poem of his. The lines, “The Englishman rules and the Indian is content to submit” and “The foreigner is full six feet tall” are intended to suggest this very idea. Narmadashanker has rendered great service to Gujarat but there were two phases in his life, the first of self-indulgence and the second of self-control. This  particular poem belongs to the period of self-indulgence. In Japan too, when they found it necessary to fight other countries beef eating became common. If, therefore, we wish to cultivate physical strength the lower way, we shall have to start eating such things.
 But brahmacharya is the only means for us if we would cultivate physcial strength the higher way. I feel pity for myself when I hear people describing me as a man of inviolate brahmacharya. I have been so described in the address presented to me. I must tell you, therefore, that the person who drafted the address does not know who may be called a man of inviolate brahmacharya. Didn’t he  ask  himself how a man like me, married and having several children,could be so described? A man of inviolate brahmacharya would never get fever, not even so much as headache, he would never have an attack of bronchitis or appendicitis. Doctors say that appendicitis may even result from an orange seed sticking in the intestines. But the seed will never be retained inside if one’s body is clean and healthy. When the intestines have lost their tone, they cannot eliminate such things in the natural course. My intestines also must have lost their tone and so I might have failed to assimilate something which I swallowed. Children often swallow similar things, but their mothers seldom take serious notice of that. The reason [why no harmful effects follow] is that their intestines have the natural strength to eliminate such things. I do not,
 
 
 therefore, want anyone to become a hypocrite by attributing to me the observance of inviolate brahmacharya [and following my example]. The power and light of inviolate brahmacharya are far greater than what I can boast of. I am not perfect in my brahmacharya, though it is true that I strive to be so. I have only placed before you a few observations from my experience which indicate how one may erect a protecting hedge [to preserve one’s brahmacharya]. Observing brahmacharya does not mean that one may not touch any woman, not even one’s sister. It means that one’s mental state must be such that touching a woman would disturb one no more than touching a piece of paper. If, in order to preserve my brahmacharya, I must guard against touching my sister to nurse her when she is ill, that brahmacharya is worth no more than the dust under our feet. We would be perfect in our brahmacharya if, even when  touching  a young and extremely beautiful woman, we are disturbed no more than when we touch a corpse. If you wish your children to be capable of such brahmacharya, you cannot prescribe their studies but should let a man like me, imperfect though he be in his brahmacharya, do that.
 A man who observes brahmacharya is a sannyasi by nature. The stage of brahmacharya is superior to that of sannyasalibtech_348_footnote, but we have corrupted it and in the result the stage of active life as a householder and that of retired life have lost their beauty, to speak nothing of the stage of sannyasa—such is our plight.
 If we follow the lower path indicated above, we shall not, even after five hundred years, be strong enough to fight the Pathans. If we can follow the higher path today, then we can meet them this very day, for the inward change required by that path can take place in no time, whereas change in our physical constitution will require ages to bring about. We shall be able to follow that higher path only if we have earned holy merit in our previous lives and if our parents equip us for the purpose.

   SPEECH AT VIRSAD  
 February 12, 1925
 Look at the marvel that is God! What for was I invited and what for   have   I   come?   Kashibhailibtech_349_footnotelibtech_350_footnotehas   decided   that   no   unnecessary
 
 expenses should be incurred  on  the  wedding  of  Dahyabhailibtech_351_footnoteand Yashoda. For that he has brought down on himself the anger of his relatives. Let me serve notice on all the rich men who have fortunes to spend on weddings that they should send all that money to me, I will put it to good use. Money spent on ostentation is not well spent. We are going the wrong way. As a result, for one in the Patidar community to have a daughter has become a torture hard to bear. When Kashibhai said that he would have an inexpensive wedding, we all agreed. I seek your approval also. Pray silently within yourself that you should have the strength to perform weddings with simplicity and in a religious spirit.
 I need not thank you for your address. Nor would you expect it. You have mentioned khadi and charkha in your address. If it is true that khadi has divine power, if the charkha has the power to win us swaraj and if it is a true sudarshan chakralibtech_352_footnote, then all of you should have made khadi your own. Otherwise presenting such addresses, praising khadi and the charkha and making girls sing on the occasion, serve no purpose.
 Why are the Antyajas in the meeting sitting at the back? I bow to them. I take pride in calling myself an Antyaja. I  have often said that if I am born again, I wish to be born an Antyaja. At present I do not serve them—but I am making atonement and purifying myself. I wish to ask of Hindu society “Do you want to cast me out just as you cast out the Antyajas?” Even though I am a non-Antyaja at present, I cannot say that I follow all the injunctions in thought, word and action. My prayer is that if I be reborn I should be a purnapurushalibtech_353_footnoteand that in an Antyaja family. It is not the mark of a Kshatriya to make them sit at the back. Patidars are a brave  community. They have many good qualities as well as a few bad ones. But there is none in this world who is without good qualities and none without bad. None of us is a true Purushottamalibtech_354_footnote. That would be most unlikely in the Kaliyug. I can’t therefore think of the Antyajas as low. It is much better to live among them and be untou-chable than to live with you and be touchable. I have to seek forgiveness in the court of God. He will tell me that, if I consider them untouchables, they will
 
 give me a slap on my face; because I am guilty of the sin of treating my brothers as beasts. Kshatriyas do not retrace their steps. Keeping the Antyajas backward is retracing one’s steps. I tell you this lest you should do wrong by keeping the Antyajas backward. I tell you this because attempts are being made to hide the adharmalibtech_355_footnote.
 Patidars tyrannize over lower communities, beat them and exact forced labour from them. I know that this is true. Dread such conduct. If you persist in it, your courage would ebb away. One who is happy should try to make others happy. It is our duty to bear hardships and make the world happy. It is devilish to make others unhappy while we enjoy our pleasures. It is not your address I want. I want rather that you should make your Antyaja brothers happy and by so doing be happy yourselves.

   SPEECH AT PALEJ  
 February 13, 1925
 We must develop fearlessness at the end of a war and, by doing constructive work, acquire the capacity to plan and execute. If we do not have the latter, our independence cannot be preserved.  If  we secure swaraj through non-violence, it can be preserved through service. If we want swaraj for the sake of power it can be retained only through violence. It is worthwhile to foster the strength of non- violence and give up the strength that comes from power. As long as we do not have the strength to live together, swaraj cannot be won through  non-violence.  That  is  why  I   placed   before   the   public a
 
 threefold programme.
 We can do anything in the name of religion but, when we realize that it is adharma, we cannot persist in doing that. To me untoucha- bility is more unethical than slavery. When the movement for ending untouchability was going on here, there was a suggestion that Christians should take part in it. But I objected to it. An honest Christian like George Josephlibtech_356_footnotelibtech_357_footnotewanted to enrol himself for this work in Vykom but I had said “No” to him. If we go to the whole world for help, our work may become more complicated.

   ABOUT STUDENTS  
A friend writes:libtech_358_footnote
 I have often acknowledged the sacrifices made by students. But it is a universal rule admitting of no exception that the world does not take note of the sacrifices of those who themselves proclaim their sacrifices, for that is no sacrifice which has to be proclaimed by the person making it. Sacrifice speaks for itself. Would it not be better if the students thought of what they had gained, rather than of what they had sacrificed?
 Anyone who does not know that national education is of value in itself does not know what it is. Snatakas need not believe that the value of the graduates of national universities has now gone down. Why should they themeselves reduce their value by believing so? I would expect these graduates to have full confidence in themselves. Let them not behave as baggars without self-respect. They should have faith in God. Do they want me to beg before the Rulers of Indian States? Why should they not enhance their value by their own knowledge and strength of character? We should hope for a time when employers themselves would demand graduates of national universities. It is for snatakas to hasten such a time. A diamond lying among pieces of glass cannot long remain undetected. That should be
 
 the condition of national graduates. In my speeches in Kathiawar, I do not wish to utter a single word about snatakas. I am going there is the hope of being able to spread the use of khadi and the spinning-wheel, to convert the Rulers and the authorities of the States to love of khadi.  I am going there so that I may request the Rulers to thing of their duty. If the value of khadi and the spinning-wheel comes to be better recognized, that of national graduates is bound to rise,  for  those among them who have not fully mastered the science of spinning do not deserve to be called national graduates. I am going to Kathiawar in the hope of being able to create an atmos-phere in which people would require the services of experts in spinning in the same way that State officers formerly required the services of secretaries proficient in English.
 Having said this, I beg leave of my correspondent to correct a few of his errors. It is not true, as he believes, that a non-co-operating student cannot suspend non-co-operation as others have done. The painful and humiliating truth is that thousands of students who had joined non-co-operation have returned, and more are returning, to co- operation, that some snatakas, whom we had taken to be non-co- operators, have appeared at examinations controlled by the Govern- ment though they had obtained national diplomas. As against this, some lawyers had their sanadslibtech_359_footnotecancelled by the courts and are forced to be among non-co-operators. Some others, moreover, who were in Government service and resigned their posts are truly in a pitiable condition, but they do not feel that way and are as happy as kings, for though enjoying the benefits of Government service they were slaves then, and are free now though without those benefits. For this reason, they regard themselves as fortunate.
 I, therefore, ask those students who are overcome with despair to see that they have no reason to lose heart; on the contrary, they have brighter prospects before them. Of course, this is subject to one condition. The general impression about non-co-operating students is that they should be upright, fearless, self-controlled, hardworking and patriotic. Students who possess these qualities will have no reason any time to lose heart. The salvation of the country depends on them. They will be the foundation on which the golden temple of the  Goddess of Freedom will be raised.

   MY NOTES  
 A  CORRECTION
 I said in the last issue that I would declare open a  national school at Rajkot. The auspicious ceremony, however, is to be performed by the Thakore Saheb. That had always been the intention of the workers and in case the Thakore Saheb was not available I would be there to perform the ceremony. Having had no telegram or definite information on this point, I assumed that I would have to do the job. I was in Delhi, touring, and I wrote the note in question from there. I was happy to find, on my return to Ahmedabad, that the opening ceremony would be performed by the Thakore Saheb. This, of course, is the most proper arrangement.
 AN EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW
 Hulyal is a town in Karnatak. The Secretary of the taluk [Congress] Committee there writes as follows:libtech_360_footnote
 This Municipality deserves compliments. If, besides doing the work described above, it pays attention to the civic needs of the town, keeps the public tank clean and sees to it that cattle do not wallow in it while quenching their thirst, and men and women do not bathe and wash clothes in the very same tank, and if it provides pure and cheap milk for children, then it must be regarded as a model municipality. If its example is followed by all other municipalities it requires no effort to see that our problems would be solved and the level of public life would rise very high.

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO WELCOME ADDRESS, RAJKOTlibtech_361_footnote  
 [February 15, 1925]libtech_362_footnote
As I entered the Darbargadh today my memory went back to an
 
 incident of my childhood which happened on this very  spot  and which I have treasured all these years. It was customary in those days, on the occasion of a royal wedding, to send a deputation to bridal States, before the wedding took place. The sons of the minister would form part of the deputation. My father who was then minister, however, had made it a point never to send his boys on  such  occasions. At the time which I am recalling today, deputations were to go to Kanpur and Dharampur. My father, of course, kept us back. My good mother, who was more worldly and did not want her children to be robbed of the prizes of position, pressed my brother and me to go to the late Thakore Saheb and cry before him. When he asked us what we were after, we were to tell him that we wanted to go to Dharampur. We followed the advice and we were sent not to Dharamapur but Kanpur. Today also I must cry to conquer. I shall cry not for name and fame or wealth and position. Fame, said the shastrislibtech_363_footnotewho blessed me, was ever a virgin inasmuch as she failed to find a suitable match for her, and they wished that that coy damsel should at last wed with me. May she ever remain “in single blessedness”. For I am sure that were she to marry me I would be undone. I cry not, therefore, for fame, but one or two things you have withheld from me.
 I am thankful for all the kind things you have said about me, and more for the kinder sentiment expressed by the Thakore Saheb. I wish I was worthy of them. I do not for a moment flatter myself with the belief that I am all I have been described to be . I am one of the people and want to continue as such. Let me pray that I may remain untouched by the honour you have done me.
 Whilst, then, I thank you I must register my complaint about one or two things. You have omitted all mention of that in the address, whether purposely or not I do not know. You have rightly mentioned truth and non-violence as my guiding principles. I would indeed be a lifeless corpse without those two life-principles. But I am surprised that you have studiously omitted all reference to the two things , pursuit of which is inseparable from the practice of truth and non- violence. I refer to khaddar and removal of untouchability. These two things are in a manner more important than Hindu-Muslim unity, for that unity is impossible without them. So long as we have not rid
 
  
 
 
 
 Hinduism of the stain of untouchability, it is impossible to achieve real Hindu-Muslim unity.
 A very thoughtful Mussalman once told me that so long as there was untouchability in Hinduism it was difficult for Mussalmans to entertain any regard for that faith or its followers. I have repeated times without number that an “untouchable” community is unknown to the Shastras. The weaver and the scavenger are not classed as untouchables by the Shastras. I am both. My mother was certainly a scavenger inasmuch as she cleaned me when I was a child. But she did not, on that account, become an untouchable. Why then should a Bhangi, who renders similar necessary service, be regarded as untouchable? Even if the whole world of shastris were to be against me I would proclaim from the housetops that they are wrong in considering untouchability to be part of the Hindu religion.
 And in this connection I take leave to mention one thing that both pleased and pained me . I was glad to notice that the shastris’ blessings was the first item of today’s programme. But I wondered whether there was a false ring about them. Their praise meant endorsement of my work on untouchability. Did they approve of my activity about it or did they merely obey the presumed or declared will of the Thakore Saheb that they should bless me? The benediction rang untrue because of the omission in your address of my campaign against untouchability. I beseech you, Thakore Saheb, to be kind to them, to befriend the depressed people of your State, even as Rama of old befriended Shabari and Guha, both presumably untouchables. I ask you to ensure them admission into schools, temples and all public places.
 I was distressed to find the boy scouts clad in foreign khaki. I did expect that these at least would be clad in khaddar. If you have khaddar uniforms for your boy scouts and your Police  you  can relieve the misery of the poor, the untouchables and the indigent widow. I entreat you, therefore, Thakore Saheb and members of the Representative Assembly, to resolve to wear khaddar and to have khaddar uniforms for all the State employees. You have given me a rich casket. I have no strong-room nor safe to keep it in. Nor have I
 
 men to keep charge of the strong-room or the safe, if I had them. I have thus to hand over all such costly presents to friends like Jamnalal Bajaj to take care of them for public use. But I have room enough to store khaddar and I therefore beg khaddar of everyone I meet; I would not hesitate to ask even Lord Reading to dress himself and his orderly in khaddar.
 Your sword, worthy ruler, is a mighty symbol. Your path is like your sword’s edge, you may not depart by even a hair’s breadth from the straight and narrow path of truth. It is an eternal reminder of the fact that in your state there should be not a single drunkard, and no impure man or woman. It is your duty to put strength where there is weakness and cleanliness where there is dirt. Befriend the poor and the oppressed. Your sword is not meant for others’ necks, it is meant for your own. You can tell your people that the moment you exceed the bounds of your authority they may put you to the sword. I speak in these terms to you as I owe a duty to you, Thakore Saheb. Your father made my father an unconditional gift of some land. I have thus eaten your salt and I should not be worth the salt, if I did not on this solemn occasion invite your attention to what are a prince’s obvious duties. The honour you have done me lays me under a deep debt of gratitude. I prize the relief of the poor and the oppressed and the untouchables more than all that honour. Tell me that you have introduced numerous spinning-wheels in your villages and schools, that you have introduced khaddar in all your departments, and that all your public institutions and places are thrown open to the untoucha- bles, and I shall feel doubly honoured and in reverence bow down my head to you. May God bless you with strength to serve your people.

   SPEECH AT OPENING OF NATIONAL 		SCHOOL, RAJKOT  
 February 15, 1925
 This school, or rather the Vidyapith from which it has sprung, is a part of the great experiment which is at present being conducted in the country. Durbars and Indian States rarely undertake an exper- iment of this kind. Their general inclination is to follow the royal path. We shall hardly find any State which would think of abandoning this path and venturing upon experiments. It is for the people, not their rulers, to undertake experiments. Rulers are the protectors and representatives of their subjects. If I may go further, I would say that a real king is the servant of his subjects. He cannot, therefore, conduct experiments at their cost. From that point of view, the Thakore Saheb was right in what he said regarding teachers, but people like me who have spent their whole lives in making experiments cannot follow any other course. I would, therefore, pray to the Thakore Saheb to look kindly on us. If the rules intended for the teachers of a country which aspires to be free, that is, to be self-controlled, are not very strict, we shall find it difficult to get teachers of even moderate quality for the ordinary schools.
 I would tell the teachers that they should always be ready to face difficulties, and should follow the path of dharma till the very end. No matter if the number of students goes down from 150 to 40, they should continue to serve the school. It is their faith which will give a magnetic quality to the school and attract more students in the future. It is said that we are always brave in the beginning, but, when difficulties come, instead of praying to the God of mercy we abandon the task, the egotists that we are. If we examine the history of nations, we shall see that among people who enjoy freedom there have been countless men and women who had remained loyal to their principles at the cost of their lives. It does not matter if the school makes no progress, not merely for five years but for twenty years. In the history of a school twenty years mean nothing. Whether or no we see any tangible results, if the teachers have faith in themselves they should follow what seems to them the most straightforward path; they are bound, in the end, to see the coast.
 It is necessary to say a few words about the distinctive features of this school. One is that it has decided to admit Antyajas in the face
 
 of many difficulties, and another that it has given the highest importance to bodily labour. Its teachers and pupils have had a share in the labour behind the greenery we see on its grounds. Such bodily labour is a form of yajna. In his age, however, the best yajna for this country consists in spinning. Every man and woman should give half an hour daily to the spinning-wheel for the sake of the country, for the sake of the Antyajas, of the countless poor and the numberless widows. The parents should realize that their children ought to  cultivate not only their intellect but also their bodies, should learn not merely to serve their own interests but also to work for public good. Those who see that the spinning-wheel advances public good, will never abandon it. I hear, on the contrary, that parents do not like their children to do bodily work, they do not like them to spin. True knowledge consists in a harmonious development of the body, the intellect and the soul. Our highest welfare lies in cultivating all the three. Ours is a country in which even self-sacrificing and hard- working teachers will lose heart. I pray to the Thakore Saheb that he should look kindly on teachers living in such an atmosphere.
 Does the school violate any moral principles? If it does, the position of course would be different. Maybe some will think that the issue of untouchability involves a moral principle; those parents who think that contact with Antyajas defiles us need not send their children to this school. I will then pray to God to open my eyes if I was in the wrong, or to vouchsafe that the parents should give up their obstinacy if they are in the wrong.
 I shall say in conclusion that this school will  not  prosper through the sympathetic interest of the Thakore Saheb or through the efforts of the parents, nor will it prosper because of my efforts or Vallabhbhai’s or through the promise of help by the none too flourishing Vidyapith. Everything will depend on the teachers. I do not believe that money alone can help any institution. If it could, the Hardinge School in Calcutta would not have had to be closed. It did not succeed because it did not get sincere workers to breathe life into it, such as an institution of its kind requires. You should aspire to give life to this school and should start work with God’s name on your lips. Those who regard themselves as weak as women and work with God’s name of their lips, who turnto God with Draupadi’s piteous crylibtech_364_footnotelibtech_365_footnotefor help, will need neither the Thakore Saheb’s support nor the
 
 Vidyapith’s assistance. If, therefore, it becomes necessary to close the school, the blame will be entirely the teachers’.

   SPEECH AT OPENING OF JAIN STUDENTS’ HOSTEL,  
 RAJKOT
 February 15, 1925
 The Thakore Saheb expounded fine ideas about education, but was pessimistic about being able to put them into effect in a small State like this. But there is no justification for his pessimism. In fact a State enjoys many advantages in being small. The people of Rajkot are such that it should be easy to win their co-operation. The smaller countries of Europe, like Sweden, Norway and Switzerland—countries about which the world has not heard much because they were not involved in the last War—boast a civilization in no way inferior to that of the bigger coun-tries; they have carried out many successful experiments in the field of education. The problems of big countries are also big. I can well understand what difficulties a person in the position of Lord Reading generally has to contend with. With so many parties and interests to consider, and the field of work so large, what effective work can be done? It is, therefore, only in small countries that promising plans can be easily implemented. The Gujarat Vidy- apith has been, in a way, doing what the Thakore Saheb explained. If we run one model institution with ideal students, many more institu- tions of the same kind will grow out of it. A  zero  can  produce nothing, for it cannot be multiplied, whereas one can grow into many. There is, therefore, no cause for despair. The cause of despair  generally lies in the man himself. The atman is its own friend and its own enemy.libtech_366_footnotelibtech_367_footnoteWe may not put any limits to what human effort can achieve. There can be any such limits only if we can see above us any obstruction to upward flight. For rising the sky is the only limit. There is a limit to how low we can fall. God Himself has created such limit in the form of land, rock, water, etc. Hence we need not despair. I advise the people to take the fullest advantage of the Ruler, and should like to say to the latter that he has done much, but much more needs to be done.
 
 The Ruler and the subjects should develop the  completest  mutual understanding and confidence. If it is true to say “As the Ruler, so the subjects”, it is equally true to say “As the subjects, so the Ruler”. If you yourselves do nothing, however much the Ruler may wish to help, he, too, can do nothing. If you let hypocrisy, flattery and wickedness govern your lives, the Ruler’s life is bound to mirror those evils. I have to mention this because the saying, “Salt is better even than honey”, is still true.

 Your kind card to hand. The Travancore Legislative Council yesterday voted by 22 against 21 against the right of entry to the Vykom temple road for which purpose satyagraha is now being offered. Naturally people here are very much agitated and feel aggrieved all the more, because the voting was gained by the direct pressure brought by the Government on the voters. I am ashamed to say, one member of the depressed and prohibited classes himself voted against the entry and sided with the Government. The situation hereafter is fraught with all kinds of difficulties. There is very little enthusiasm now for the peacecful methods of satyagraha. Some have already begun to advocate “direct action” and even forcible entry into temples. Small-pox has broken out in the Satyagraha Camp itself and with the growing heat of the advancing summer it may attack more and more. We are carrying the struggle with faith in your leadership and gospel of non-violence. But I am afraid the Provincial  Congress Committee of Kerala is waning in its enthusiasm. They have collected very little money during the last many months by their own efforts. For everything we depend on your own esteemed help and advice. We are hard up for money. All satyagrahis are anxiously awaiting your forthcoming visit which would, it is needless to say, be of inestimable help to our cause.
 It is a good letter because it is a frank letter. I am unable to congratulate the Travancore Government, if the facts are as stated. But  I do not know them. I therefore suspend my judgment till I know them first hand . I am eager to visit Vykom at the earliest possible date. I hope that it will not be long.
 Meanwhile, satyagrahis must not be dejected. They dare not give way to despair. Of all my Tamil lessons one proverb at least abides with me as an evergreen. Its literal meaning is, “God is the only Help for the helpless”. The grand theory of satyagraha is built upon a belief in that truth. Hindu religious literature, indeed all religious literature, is full of illustrations to prove the truth. The Travancore Durbar may have failed them. I may fail them. But God will never fail them, if they have faith in Him. Let them know that they are leaning on a broken reed if they are relying on me. I am living at a safe distance from them. I may wipe their tears, but suffering is their sole privilege. And victory will surely come out of their sufferings provided they are pure. God tries His votaries through and through, but never beyond endurance. He gives them strength enough to go through the ordeal He prescribes for them. For the satyagrahis of Vykom their satyagraha is not a mere experiment to be given up if it does not succeed within a prescribed time or after a prescribed force
 of suffering. There is no time limit for a satyagrahi nor is there a limit to his capacity for suffering. Hence there is no such thing as defeat in satyagraha. Their so-called defeat may be the dawn of victory. It may be the agony of birth.
 The Vykom satyagrahis are fighting a battle of no less consequence than that of swaraj. They are fighting against an age long wrong and prejudice. It is supported by orthodoxy, superstition, custom and authority. Theirs is only one among the many battles that must be fought in the holy war against irreligion masquerading as religion, ignorance appearing in the guise of learning. If their battle is to be bloodless, they must be patient under the severest trials. They must not quail before a raging fire.
 The Congress Committee may give them no help. They may get no pecuniary help, they may have to starve. Their faith must shine through all these dark trials.
 Theirs is “direct action”. They dare not be irritated  against their opponents. They know no better. They are not all dishonest men as satyagrahis are not all honest men. They are resisting what they honestly believe to be an encroachment upon their religion. The Vykom satyagraha is the argument of suffering. The hardest heart and the grossest ignorance must disappear before the rising sun of suffering without anger and without malice.
 I am alarmed at the appearance of small-pox in the satyagraha camp. It is a disease born of filth and yields to hygienic treatment. They must isolate small-pox patients and discover the cause of the disease. Is their camp in a perfectly sanitary condition? Doctors have no medicine for small-pox. Water cure is the best cure. Low diet or no diet is the safest. Let the patients have copious draughts of pure water. Above all neither the patients nor the others should lose nerve. The disease is also a course of suffering. Soldiers’ camps are not free from disease. Indeed it has been ascertained that more soldiers  die  of  disease than of bullet wounds.
 For finance, they need not worry. Their faith will bring them all the pecuniary aid they may need. I know of no good cause that has died for want of funds.

   HINDU-MUSLIM QUESTION  
A correspondent writes:
 You have entertained in the columns of Young India an attempt made by one of your correspondents to show up the shibboleth of  the  Muslims’ extreme backwardness in education. That emboldens me, if you will permit an humble worker in the country’s cause, to put before you one more of these shibboleths which has been ruling our political life for long, but which is palpably more absurd than the one as regards Muslim backwardness to which I am glad your attention has at last been drawn.
 “The Muslims are a minority in India.” How often is such a statement made, and how many times more is it tacitly assumed in political argument! But are they really a minority? Even taking one sect of them, viz., the Sunni
 Henafi, for comparison, do we not find that it is numerically stronger by far
 than any single community amongst the Hindus, or even than each of the other religious groups in India, as the Christians, Parsis, Sikhs, Jains, Jews and Buddhists? And is it not the case that the Hindus are divided into communities and sects which are in most cases farther apart from one another socially than the Muslims are from the non-Muslims? Then, what about the Hindu untouchables? Is not their number equal to, if not greater than, that of the Muslim “minority”? If Muslims as “a minority” in India may claim separate and special treatment, protection and guarantees, how much stronger must the claim of this untouchable section of Hindus be allowed to be, since they not only are by their numbers as important a “minority”—and a claimant one too, since the date of the Lucknow Pactlibtech_368_footnote, —but have been suffering for ages from actual present disabilities with which no Muslim or any other touchable minority’s apprehensions for the future may possibly bear comparison? As witness the Vykom satyagraha, the palghat dispute, the Bombay “lynchers”. I leave alone the innumerable backward castes and the aborigines so far reckoned within the Hindu fold. Are the Muslims then the minority?
 The italics and the black types are the writer’s. I have given the letter for its undoubted earnestness. And yet to me, an ob- server untouched, I hope, by any bias one way or the other, the reasoning appears to be specious when it is used to demonstrate that the Mussalmans are not a minority in India. The writer forgets that the claim is that of all Mussalmans against all Hindus. The latter cannot
 
 both have the cake and eat it. Though divided among themselves, the Hindus do present a more or less united front not only to the Mus- salmans but to all non-Hindus, even as the  Mussalmans  though divided among themselves present naturally a united front to all non- Muslims. We shall never solve the question by ignoring facts or re- arranging them to suit our plans. The facts are that the Mussalmans are seven crores against twenty-two crores of Hindus. The latter have never denied it. Let us also know the issues. A minority does not always fear a majority be-cause it is a majority. The Mussalmans fear the Hindu majority because the Hindus, they say, have not always treated them with justice, have not respected their religious prejudices and because, they say, the Hindus are superior to them in education and wealth. Whether these are facts or not is irrelevant for our purpose. It is enough that Mussalmans believe them and therefore are afraid of the Hindu majority. The Mussalmans expect to meet this fear only partially be means of separate electorates and special represen- tation even in excess of their number in some cases. The Hindus admit the Mussalman minority but deny the Mussalman charge of injustice. This must therefore be verifed. I have not known Hindus to deny the statement that they are superior to Mussalmans in education and wealth.
 The Hindus on their part fear the Mussalmans because they (the Hindus) say that Mussalmans whenever they have held power have treated them with great harshness and contend that though they were in a majority they were non-plussed by a handful of Mussalman invaders, that the danger of a repetition of the experience is ever present before the Hindus, and that in spite of the sincerity of the leading Mussalmans the Mussalman masses are bound to make common cause with any Mussalman adventurer. The Hindus therefore reject the plea of weakness on the part of the Mussalmans and refuse to entertain the idea of extending the doctrine of the Lucknow Pact. It is again beside the question whether the Hindu fear is justified. The fear is a fact to be reckoned with. It would be wrong to  impute  motives to any community or leaders. To distrust Malaviyaji or Mian Fazl-i-Hussain is to postpone a proper solution. Both honestly state what they feel. Wisdom lies therefore in brushing aside all side issues and facing the situation as it is, not as we would like it to be.
 In my opinion therefore the writer has tried, be it ever so unconsciously, to overprove his case. He is right in saying that Hindus
 are divided into many antagonistic sects or parties each setting up a claim or separate treatment. He is right also in stating that the untouchables have even stronger case than the Mussalmans for separate representation. The writer has made out a case not against the fact of Mussalman minority but against communal representation and separate electorates. He has shown that any extension of the doctrine of the Lucknow Pact must inevitably lead to communal representation for innumerable sub-castes and other denominations, thus indefinitely postponing the early advent of swaraj.
 To extend the Lucknow Pact doctrine or even to retain it is fraught with danger. To ignore the Mussalman grievance as if it was not felt is also to postpone swaraj. Lovers of swaraj cannot therefore rest till a solution is found which would allay Mussalman apprehen- sions and yet not endanger swaraj. Such a solution is not impossible.
Here is one.
 In my opinion the Mussalman claim for majority in Bengal and the Punjab in accordance with their numbers is irresistible. That claim cannot be resisted for the fear from the north or the North West. Hindus, if they want swaraj, must take the chance. So long as we fear the outside world, we must cease to think of swaraj. But swaraj we must have. I would therefore rule out the Hindu fear in considering the just claim of the Mussalmans. We must dare to do justice even at the cost of future safety.
 What the Mussalmans want is not separate electorate for its own sake but they want their own real representatives to be sent to the legislatures and other elective bodies. This can be done by private arrangement rather than legal imposition. There is flexibility about private arrangement. A legal imposition tends to become more and more rigid. Private arrangement will continually test the honour and good faith of each party. Legal imposition avoids the necessity of honour or good faith. Private arrangement means a domestic settle- ment of domestic quarrels and a solid wall of united  opposition against a common enemy—the foreign rule. I am told that the law prevents the working of the private arrangement I have in view. If it is so, we must seek to remove the legal obstacle and not create and add a new one. My plan therefore is to do away with separate electorates but secure the elec-tion of the desired and agreed number of Mussalman and other candidates in a given constituency under a joint ticket, Mussalman candidates o be nominated by previously known Mussal-
 
 man associations. I need not enter into the question of representation in excess of numbers at the present stage. It can be considered and all difficulties in that direction can be met when the principle of private arrangement is accepted by all.
 No doubt my proposal presupposes a sincere desire on the part of all concerned to reach a solution in terms of swaraj. If communalism is the goal, then any private arrangement must break down. If, however, swaraj is the goal and the parties approach the question purely from a national standpoint, there need be no fear of a break-down. On the contrary every party will be interested in its  faithful working.
 What the law should, however, provide is a just franchise whereby every community can have, if it wished, voters on the roll in proportion to its numbers. Our voters’ rolls should answer the number of representatives in proportion to its population. But that question requires a critical examination of the working of the existing franchise. For me the existing franchise is wholly untenable for any swaraj scheme.

   NOTES  
 REMEMBER 1ST MARCH
 It will be remembered that many workers made promises at Belgaum just after the close of the session as to the number of self- spin-ning members they would register before the 1st March next. That day is soon coming upon us. I have before me the list  of promised members. I hope the makers of these promises will prove as good as their word. Let me say for general information  that  the number promised for the whole of India was 6,803. All the workers
 
 were not present at the time. Bihar and Gujarat have, for instance, resolved upon securing far more than the figures promised at Belgaum. I would like the Provincial Secretaries, if they kindly will, to telegraph to Young India the numbers of self-spinning and other members registered at the end of the month. Workers everywhere are finding the task of securing voluntary spinners far more difficult than getting four-anna members. To me the value of the spinning franchise consists in its dificulty due not to want of ability but want of application. For let it be noted that the difficulty is confined not merely to unbelievers, it is applicable also to believers. They readily make promises but equally if not more readily break them. Witness the falling off in spinning during the month of December. I hope therefore that there will be ceaseless effort on the part of those who made promises.
 RE: PRIZE ESSAY
 Some friends have suggested that the time for sending in the prize eassay on hand-spinning and khaddar should be extended. One friend suggests the extension to as late as November. If I did so, it would defeat the purpose for which the essay is required. Mr. Revashanker has issued the prize with a view to stimulate thought and activity on the message of the spinning-wheel during this year of grace which is fast running out. The idea moreover of allowing a brief period is to concentrate the energy of the few searchers we have on the subject and to make it worthwhile even from a pecuniary standpoint for those khaddar students who may be in need, to devote their whole attention during the period to the essay. I do not expect an exhaustive treatise, but I do expect a classical introductory essay on the subject so as to serve as an infallible guide for more elaborate work. It should give an exhaustive bibliography on the subject and a scientific, brief, relevant, connected, summary of them.
 There are many who question the facts often set forth in these columns and elsewhere to prove the economic value of the wheel. Many doubt the ability of the wheel to compete with the mills. Others regard it as a mere toy incapable even of producing an effect on the foreign cloth imports. The essay should contain incontestable statistics and argument in support of the value of the wheel unless the  researches of impartial and truthful students make such presentation impossible. Such an effort is required during this year whilst the
 
 spinning franchiselibtech_370_footnotelibtech_371_footnoteis being tested.
 I am happy to be able to inform the reader that some brilliant young men are regularly at the work already and that too not for its monetary value but for the love of it. I have consulted two of them on the suggestion of extension and they would be glad if the time can be extended. I am therefore extending the period to 30th April next. That means six more weeks. I trust that the extension will be considered sufficient by all who are making the attempt to bring out an essay worthy of the occasion.
 Another suggestion comes from another friend. He thinks that the examiners should include one or more mill-owners, such as Messrs Ambalal Sarabhai and Matubhai Kantawala. The names of examiners were selected by me and I must confess that the omission of a mill- owner’s name was deliberate. I felt that the examiners to be just to the subject should be believers in khaddar but open to reason and able to judge. My correspondent, however, suggests that even experts like Mr. Maganlal Gandhi are likely to make mistakes for their want of an intimate knowledge of the mill industry. I recognize the force of the objection and will therefore gladly put myself in correspondence with the gentlemen concerned and seek their co-operation in the examination.
 BENGAL UNTOUCHABLES
A Bengali correspondent asks:
  In 	Bengal the 	untouchables are 	not allowed to 	draw water from the 	wells, nor 	are they allowed to 	enter the 	room where drinking 	water is 	kept. What 	should be 	done to 	remove this 	evil? If 	we dig separate 	wells for them 	or establish separate schools, that will be making allowance for this vice.  The 	mentality of 	the untouchables 	in Bengal 	is that 	the upper classes 	should take 	water from their hands, 	but they themselves 	refuse to take 	water from 	the hands 	of those 	who are below 	them. What should be done 	to wean 	them from the error?  The 	Hindu Mahasabha in 	Bengal and 	the Hindus in 	general tell the 	people that you do not like the idea of taking water from the hands of untouchables—? 
My answers are:
  One 	way of removing 	the evil 	is for 	us to take 	water from the hands of the untouchables. I do not think that digging of separate 
 
 wells for them will perpetuate the evil. It will take a long time to root out the effects of untouchability. It would be wrong to withhold help from the untouchables in the shape of providing them with separate wells for fear of others never letting them use public wells. My belief is that if we build good wells for the untouchables many people will use them. Reform among the untouchables must proceed side by side with breaking down of the prejudice against them by caste. Hindus realizing their duty towards them.
  When 	the so-called 	“superior” Hindus 	begin to “touch” 	the untouchables, 	the untouchability 	among the untouchables 	thems- elves 	is bound 	to die 	a natural 	death. Our work must 	commence with 	the lowest 	among the untouchables.  I 	do not 	know what the 	Hindu Mahasabha 	of Bengal 	has been 	ascribing to 	me. My 	position is 	clear. Untouchables 	should be 	treated as 	and classed among 	Sudras. And since 	we do take 	water from the 	hands of 	Sudras, we should 	not hesitate 	to accept is 	from untouchables. 
 HOW IMPRISONMENT BENEFITS
 I quote interesting extracts from Acharya Gidwani’s letter to his wife which I have been privileged to share with her:
 How are the children? Do cure them and yourself of the tea habit and give them all the milk that they can get. How is your study progressing? You will not make further improvement soon unless you attend to your composition. I trust that you are not neglecting Hindi and spinning. Spend all the hours of daylight in sunshine and fresh air. Although the gain seems small, I feel distinctly better. By the time you come again, I hope to be quite presentable; thanks to Muller’s system to which Jawaharlallibtech_372_footnotehad introduced me when he shared a cell with me here, the injury to my health is not irreparable. Throughout those nine months of confinement I kept up my breathing and muscular exercises. I have almost mastered the system. I wish I could persuade you also to start on it and bring up the children on it also. In any case tell Parvati that I want her to introduce it at once for young and old at home. The book is available at booksellers.
 I have not read much since I wrote to you last. My Sanskrit study is interrupted for want of the books I asked you to send me.
 
 I am taking lessons in carpentry now. I hope to start on weaving after some time.
 As an ex-prisoner it is pleasant to compare notes with fellow prisoners. Acharya Gidwani is not alone in developing dislike of tea in his prison. I was myself a regular drinker of tea and coffee. But my first experience cured me of the habit. There was no tea allowed, and I began to like the idea of being free from the slavery of tea. For us in India it is a luxury we can ill-afford. But the worst of tea is that it replaces milk. Tea has only as much nutritive value as there are milk and sugar in it. The way we prepare tea in India counteracts the effect of milk and sugar because of the boiling of the leaves which sets free the injurious tanin contained in the leaf. If tea is to be drunk at all the leaves should never be boiled but they should be put in a strainer and boiling water poured gently over them. The water that thus trickles down into the kettle should be straw colour. But the safest thing to do is to follow Acharya Gidwani’s prescription and to give up tea altogether. Those who want simply to drink, but not eat, may take boiling water with sugar and milk and add a little cinnamon powder to give the water a colouring. Acharya Gidwani’s remarks on Muller’s system will be read with interest. In my opinion the Acharya shares the weakness of new converts. All these systems promise much more than they can perform. There is nothing new in Muller’s system. It is an indifferent and incomplete reproduction of some of the Hatha Yogalibtech_373_footnotelibtech_374_footnotepractices. Considered purely from a health point of view  Hatha Yoga practices are almost perfect. Only they share with everything Indian the disabilities of their origin. The secret consists in deep and well-regulated breathing and gently tretching the muscles. Muller attracts us because he has given physical reasons for the exercises he prescribes. His system has its use, no doubt, in that those who will not take the trouble to understand the intricacies of Hatha Yoga exercises can certainly profit by following the easy instructions prepared by Muller. What is more, we have not many accessible representatives of Hatha Yoga and the few there are naturally and rightly do not trouble about its physical consequences and therefore teach them only to those who are spiritually minded.
 Lovers of spinning cannot but appreciate  the  Acharya’s devotion to the wheel and to Hindi and Sanskrit. It is pleasure to me to be able to give after a long time a cheery letter from Acharya Gidwani
 
 who is now keeping much better health than he did some time ago.
 THE LATEST DISCOVERY
 Since my return from Pindi I have visited nearly ten villages of Borsad taluk. It is a taluk of the successful and glorious satyagraha of 1923 under Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel’s leadership. It contains an intelligent, able and comparatively hard population. But even in this taluk I was pained to find in some villages squalor and degradation that were due purely to poverty. The crops were damaged by a severe frost. In certain villages the people were in constant danger of having their fields raided by cattle lot loose upon them at the instance practically of the principal landowner. It was not possible for them to feel settled in life or feel that they had a home of their own which they could take pride in. The result was despair and consequent indifference to effort. There was nothing but the charkha for such people. But even the charkha makes slow headway. They do not want to do anything. They want merely to eke out a living somehow. “We have gone on like this for years, let us close our lives like this”, is the reply written in their blank and incredulous looks. It is the same thing to them even if one presented them with some other industry. They do not want to work because they have hither- to slaved. And having only done that, they believe in slaving but not in working . This is a sad discovery not made by me for the first time. It was the same thing in Champaran, worse in Orissa. But it came upon me in Borsad taluk with  a strange and overwhelming force. I was ill-prepared for the discovery in this taluk. On the contrary I had expected to find well-ordered villages where I would see enthusiasm and brightness and hope. Not that all the villages were alike. Although they are so near one another, each has problems of its own and each has a distinct individually. For the villages I have described, the spinning-wheel is the only hope, if there is any. Cattle cannot raid it. Frost cannot bite it. It is man’s protection against cruel nature’s ravages and some protection against man’s depradations.
 Ample work awaits those patriotic young men who do not mind the village life and who can derive pleasure from silent and sustained labour, not too taxing and yet taxing enough for its monotony. It requires sufficient application to be able to appreciate the monotony of life-giving industry. A beginner of music knows the dullness of the initial effort but the very monotony becomes a pleasure as soon as he has mastered the art. So it is with the village workers. As soon as they
 have lived down the excitement of the intoxicating town life  and settled down to work, the monotony of labour will give strength and hope because it is productive. Who is ever jaded by the monotonous and unfailing regularity with which the solar system works. Though as ancient as time, it has never ceased to excite wonder and praise. We know, too, that a disturbance in the even tenor of its working means destruction of our race. So it is with the village solar system whose centre is the wheel.

  LETTER TO SIR PRABHASHANKER PATTANI 
 Magh Vad 11 [February 19, 1925]libtech_375_footnote
SUJNA BHAISHRI,
 I write this letter on the train to Porbunder and hence I am using a pencil.
 I shall be at the Ashram from 22nd to 26th and shall leave for Delhi on the 27th. I shall be staying there till at least the 3rd March. The English gentleman can see me during that period. The programme after the 3rd will be decided at Delhi.
 At the last minute, when I was about to leave Rajkot, Jayshanker Vaghji saw me on behalf of the Jam Saheb and said that he, the Jam Saheb, was eager to meet me. He wishes to meet me in Bombay after the 7th March. It has been decided that I should send a wire to Jayshanker when I go to Bombay.
 I have received an unsatisfactory reply from the Dewan  of Gondal in which he says that it is improper for me to interfere in the affairs of the Gondal State. Please let me know the result of your effort.
 In Rajkot the Thakore Saheb showed many courtesies. I have told him my ideas.
Hope your spinning-wheel is working well.

   From 	a handwritten draft: S.N. 2456; also Young 	India, 26-2-1925  GANDHI 
       SPEECH IN REPLY TO WELCOME ADDRESS, 		PORBUNDER     February 	19, 1925  	I am grateful to the citizens of Porbunder for arranging that this 	address should be presented to me by the Diwan Saheb, and compliment 	them on their good sense in giving me a cheque for Rs.  	201 instead of presenting the address in a casket of silver or 	sandalwood. If the people of this place do not understand my wishes 	and fulfil them, where else in this wide world can I expect the 	people     
 to do so? I have said at so many places that I have no provision for the safe custody of articles of silver and other valuables. To make such provision is to invite trouble. I have been able to preserve my freedom only because I have refused to possess such articles. I have been, therefore, telling the country that those who wish to follow the path of satyagraha should be ready to live in poverty and embrace death at any moment. How can I spare space for preserving a silver casket? I am, therefore, glad that you gave me a cheque instead.
 But, while on the one hand I offer compliments to you, on the other I pity myself for my avarice. My appetite is more than can be satisfied by this piece of paper. A sum of two hundred and one rupees is not good enough for me. I say this because I can assure you that you will get from me twice as much as what I take from you or even more. I do not receive a single pice which does not grow into a veritable tree raining coins—not through interest but through the manner of its use. It would be much better to perish than to live on interest. I put every pice to the best possible use and profit. I will use every pice I receive to help the country to preserve its purity and to clothe its naked. Every pie, more-over, will be accounted for. I have not come into contact with any person whom I might have told that he had given me enough. This is why my Memon friends always keep away from me. Were it not so, persons like Omar Haji Amod Zaverilibtech_378_footnotewould be present in this meeting. They tell me that wherever I meet them I try to rob them. It is, thus, very risky to be a friend of mine in these hard times. Only such persons who, being Hindus, are ready to offer their money freely for the service of the Bhangis, or are ready to use all their strength and their money to win the country’s freedom— only such persons can afford to be my friends in these hard times. The Thakore Saheb of Rajkot showered his love on me so much that I was almost drowned in the flood. But all the time I was trembling, wondering how long I would be able to retain his friendship. Why should I not feel happy at receiving an address from the hands of the Ruler of a State in which my father was a Diwan? My grandfather was the Diwan of the State during the rule of the present Maharana’s grandfather, and my great grandfather was Diwan to the latter’s  father. The Rana Saheb’s father was my friend and client. Having
 
 received material benefit from him, is it possible that I would also not be pleased by an invitation from the present Maharana Saheb? But it is difficult to retain all friendships, for instance, I have not been able to retain that of the British. The reason is that I think it necessary to preserve only one friendship in this life, namely, God’s. God means the voice of conscience. If I hear it say that I must sacrifice  the world’s friendship; I would be ready to do so. I am eager for your friendship and would not feel satisfied even if I could take away all your money. I will always ask you for more and, should you send me away, I would seek a place in God’s house. My field of work is India. So long as a fire is raging in the country, I cannot possibly think of leaving it to go anywhere else. South Africa would welcome me, but at present I would not like to go even there as the fire in Sourth Africa can be put out only when the fire in India has been put out. I have been appealing to all Princes for help in extinguishing that fire. Is it unreasonable of me to expect most from Porbunder in this matter?
 I expect similar help from the people too. I ask for co-operation from you all. If you give it, the result may be that all of us will resume co-operation with the British. I do not mean that we shall go running to them; rather, they will come running to us. They tell me that I am a good man, but that my co-workers are rogues, that incidents like the one at Chauri Chaura will betray me. But I believe in human nature. Evreyone has a soul and can exercise soul-force as much as I. You can see the soul-force in me because I have ever kept my soul wide awake by humbly entreating it, or beating a drum or dancing before it. Yours may not be equally awake, but we are all equal in our innate capacities. The Rulers and their subjects, Hindus and Muslims, all are fighting one another but without God’s help they cannot move even a blade of grass. If the subjects think that they will cultivate strength and harass the Rulers and the latter think that they can be strong enough to crush the subjects, if Hindus believe that it is no difficult matter for them to crush seven crores of Muslims and the latter think that they can easily crush the twenty-two crores of Hindus nourished on no strength-giving food, then the Rulers and the subjects, Hindus and Muslims, all are thoughtless. It is khuda’slibtech_379_footnotelibtech_380_footnoteinjunction, it is said in the Vedas and in the Bible, that all men are brothers. All  religions proclaim that the world is held together by the chain of love, and learned students of Shastras tell us that, without this chain, the atoms
 
 
 would fall apart, that water would lack the property of existing as liquid and each drop would exist by itself. If the same chain, likewise, did not bind hu-man beings to one another, we would all be dead. We should, therefore, have such a chain to bind us if we want swaraj or Ramarajya. That chain of love is no thing but the thread of hand- spun yarn. If the yarn is foreign, it would only serve as iron shackles on your feet. Your links should be with your villages, with the Rabaris and with the Mers of Barda. If, instead, you have your links with Lancashire or Ahmedabad, of what profit will that be to Porbunder? What the people really want is that we should have some use for their labour, that we should not force them to remain idle and so starve them. Is it right that instead of getting stone from  Ranavav,  you should order your requirements from Italy? How can you afford to order your cloth or ghee from Calcutta in preference to the cloth woven in your own villages and the ghee made from the milk of your own cows and buffaloes? If you do not use your own products but order your needs from elsewhere, I would say that you were chained with fetters. I have been a free man ever since I discovered this sacred principle of complete swadeshi and understood that my life should have a link with the poorest among the poor. Neither the Rana Saheb nor Lord Reading nor even King George can deprive me of my happiness.
 I should like to tell the women that I will regard myself san- ctified by their sight only when I see them adorned with khadi and know that they spin. You go to the temple regularly to preserve your dharma, but only those among you who spin will have hearts as holy as temples. I want to know from you whether you will listen to me only if I tell you about some miracles in the Himalayas. Will you say that I have lost my head because I tell you that you should have a spinning-wheel in each home as you have a stove? I am quite sane. I am wise, and have been proclaiming what I have known from experience.
 Someone asked me what I hoped to gain by  accepting an address in Porbunder, and advised me to ascertain first what class of persons here wear khadi. Instead of asking what class of persons wear khadi, I may ask whether anyone at all does so. You like to wear fine cloth. Some rich millionaires told me that even they could not afford to wear such cloth always. You will, however, get fine cloth to wear if you spin fine yarn with the same care with which you prepare thin
 shevlibtech_381_footnotelibtech_382_footnotein your homes.
 So long as this problem of yarn is not solved, you will not be able to forge the chain of love with which to bind people together. If you wish to bind the whole world with such a chain, there is, assuredly, no way but this; nor is there any other way of bringing about Hindu- Muslim unity. When I went to Rajkot, I was accompanied by Shri Shuaib Qureshilibtech_383_footnotelibtech_384_footnote. The local Muslims told him that I was deceiving him, that in asking the people to propagate khadi my motive was to ruin Muslim merchants. But Shuaib is not a man who can be misled in this manner. He knows that I would never concern myself about the  handful of merchants engaged in the foreign cloth trade. He himself is a lover of khadi, and he knows that I have not been able to serve the cause of khadi or the country as well as I have served Islam. Our Muslim brethren should know that India is the land of their birth, and that they cannot hope to free the Islamic countries without  first securing India’s freedom.
 This may turn out to be my last tour of Kathiawar. Perhaps I have only a few years to live. It was with the utmost reluctance that I accepted the Presidentship of the Congress, and also of the Kathiawar Political Conference. Only ten months remain now. I have, therefore, come here to tell you that if you look upon me more especially as your brother—though I regard myself as a brother of all living creatures—listen to my appeal and spin for half an hour daily. You will lose nothing thereby, and the country will have her problem of poverty solved. On how many things shall I pour out my heart to you? If you do not get rid of the evil of untouchability, our dharma will  perish.   True   Vaishnava   dharmalibtech_385_footnoteis  the   most   life-giving.   At present, on the contrary, Antyajas are being destroyed in the name of that dharma. The essence of Hinduism does not lie in the practice of untouchability. Eradication of untouchability, Hindu-Muslim unity and khadi—these are the three sacred articles of my faith, and I appeal to both men and women, to the prince and the pauper, to work for them.
 The evil of drink must go, and that through the people’s own efforts. I have no doubt that people can end this evil by their own efforts. If some unthinking persons had not adopted methods of
 
 
 coercion, this evil would have disappeared from the country long ago. I have heard that many sea-men in Porbunder have given up drinking, and also that the Rana Saheb approves of this movement and is ready to help. We cannot hope to be free till we are free from the evil of drink. The methods adopted in Europe for winning freedom will not help us. There is a world of difference between the temper of the people in Europe and the climate there, on the one hand, and on the other, the temper of our people and our climate.  The  people  of Europe can harden their hearts against pity, our people cannot. Muslims of other countries tell me that Muslims of India are comparatively of a mild temper. Whether this is a good thing or not, only the Hindus and the Muslims, or the world, can say. Personally, I feel that we stand to lose nothing by their being mild. Being compassionate does not mean being timid or forsaking the use of arms; the really strong man is he who, though armed, does not strike the enemy but stands before him boldly, ready to be killed. It is the ruling principle of a brave man’s life, and the essence of the Kshatriya spirit, that he never abandons his post of duty, never turns back. It is necessary for anyone who wants to cultivate these qualities to give up the use of intoxicants. I, therefore, would be happy to hear that the people of Porbunder had totally given up drinking. In Rajkot, the evil is spreading wide. The shopkeepers are competing with those in the civil station, with the result that liquor is sold at the same price as soda. But those who get liquor thus cheap shed tears of blood afterwards. Workers’ wives come and ask me if I cannot persuade the Thakore Saheb [to close the liquor-booths]. The evil of drinking, they tell me, has ruined their homes and introduced discord in their families; their husbands have taken to immoral ways and their homes are sinking into poverty. If we want to earn the blessings of these poor women, we shall have to take courage in our hands in asking the Rulers to save the people from this terror. That the drink-trade is a source of income to the State or that drinking makes people happy for a while should be no consideration with them. If the evil spreads, the condition of the country will become so frightful that it will automatically perish; no one will have to try to destroy it. May God bless you and give you the good sense to listen to my words and understand what I say, so that the entire world may benefit through you.

  SPEECH AT “ANTYAJA” MEETING, PORBUNDER 
 February 19, 1925
DIWAN SAHIB, “ANTYAJA” BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 I am very happy to see you all. I feel great happiness in meeting the Antyajas who have come here—the term denoting Dheds, Bhangis and Chamarslibtech_386_footnotewho are mistakenly treated as outcastes. You know that caste Hindus do not come into contact with Antyajas. They believe that they can offer to Antyajas the food left over by others. Thus all manner of injustice is done to them. Many amongst the Hindus are trying hard to set this right. In the Congress important discussions are going on and great efforts made [to end this].
 But they cannot do much by themselves. Your help too is needed. Many Hindus tell me: “You take their side; but you should see for yourself how these people live. They eat carrion and they do not bathe or wash. One feels nausea at the sight. They have dirty habits. How then can we touch them?”
 There is some truth in this. The truth is worth listening to. You should give up whatever is bad in you and should help in reforming yourselves. Even God does not help those who do not help themselves. So it is I tell you to help yourselves. Wash your face at dawn at four o’clock, clean your eyes of mucus, and pray to God. If you ask me how to do this, I would beg you to take the name of Rama. Krishna or Karsan, or whatever name we call Him by, signifies the same Being. But the name Rama is easiest of all. We must beg of Him, “Oh God, make us good”! Bathing once in several days is not good. You should bathe daily. Labourers should bathe at night after their work. You should not steal. You should keep your children clean. It is your fault if they are not clean. What can the poor school teacher do? The third thing is not to drink liquor. The man who drinks becomes Satan. You should not eat carrion,—in fact you should avoid meat. Won’t it do if you get only roti and milk? Those who know how to weave should keep up weaving. I can put up with it if you do not spin, but not with bad habits.

The revered memory of Shivlalbhai reminds me of the 	extent of our own loss. If we want his memory to live for ever, we 	should take his place. We should feel no shame in surpassing him in 	work. One should be ashamed only if one does not add to one’s 	inheritance. One is considered a true descendant only if one adds to 	one’s inheritance. Our duty is to add to Shivlalbhai’s legacy. I 	am sorry that this has not been done.  	It is my ambition that khadi work should become every man’s job 	and it should enter every village. As long as the wheel does not 	find a place in every single village and everyone does not wear 	khadi,    
 we are not likely to attain pure swaraj. Hindus and Muslims have not united. If they want to do so they should begin spinning. Khadi also covers the problems of Antyajas. This problem has created commition in Wadhwan. I do not understand why. We will have to embrace the Antyajas if we want to make khadi every man’s work. The good name of India depends on Muslim and Antyaja weavers. One cannot get khadi of one’s liking without an organization among weavers. I have just come from Wankaner; there are three hundred Muslim weavers there whose work is beautiful. But there are only two or three who weave hand-spun yarn. If we want others to weave khadi, we must begin spinning. We do not want those women who spin for money to give up their other occupations and spin for us. We want to make those spin who do not get even two pice. In our country where one gets only roti and salt, the wheel is a Kamadhenulibtech_392_footnote. This much of yajna is essential. It is good if it is performed system-atically.
 While doing the work of spinning do not go over to weaving. If we want fine yarn we have to spin with our own hands, and without fine cloth what will our delicate brothers do? You will pay six annas or eight annas for weaving one seer of yarn. But no one will spin for you forty-count yarn for six annas.
 If you want to preserve the memory of Shivlalbhai, then keep his work alive. Khadi work was Shivlal’s first and last love. He has given so much money for khadi work that we should be ashamed of ourselves if we failed to keep it up.

  SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, WADHWAN 
 February 21, 1925
 I am just returning from a visit to the Antyaja quarters. I felt happy as I sat among them, for I was doing my duty. For being with you here, god will certainly ask me whether I had come here to give you, the citizens of Wadhwan, any new thoughts. You have confined them to their locality and, therefore, I had much to tell them which they had never been told. I have no miracle to perform before you and dazzle you. I   only  beg  you  to   understand  your  dharma  and
 
 follow it. I will tell you nothing more than that what you take to be dharma is, in fact, sin. Ponder over this carefully, accept it only if it appeals both to your heart and to your head and cease treating the Antyajas as untouchables.
 On my returning to India [from Africa], I [first] went to Ahmedabad, consulted the citizens there, placed my views before them and established my Ashram there only after they had agreed  to support and help me for one year. In my consultations with them I had also spoken of my views on the issue of Antyajas. I said that I did not discriminate even against those belonging to other  faiths  and would most certainly admit Antyajas. They told me that I would never get Antyajas of the type I had mentioned. Well, I decided to stay there, got utensils and others articles of household use. But there was no money. But I had faith [ in God]. A few months passed and Duda- bhailibtech_393_footnotelibtech_394_footnotearrived with a note from Thakkarlibtech_395_footnotelibtech_396_footnote. As soon as I took him in, the people of Ahmedabad decided to boycott me. The people who drew water from the same well as we also boycotted us. But I told them that I would bear everything they might do, but would not leave Ahmedabad. If it is God’s will that I should live here, I told them, He will enable me to do so, otherwise I would go and live among  Antyajas. I knew, I said, what my self-respect required, and would not feel insulted by their talking angrily with me. After five days, the people using the well melted and Dudabhai was permitted to draw water from it. But the problem of money remained. But on the day I had no money left, God came in person and gave me the money I needed. One fine day, a car drove up to the  Ashram gate.  A gentleman whom I had never met previously alighted from it, came up to me and told me that he wanted to donate Rs. 13,000, and asked me if I would accept the money. Next day he came with Rs. 13,000 in banknotes, gave the money to me and left. That Satyagraha Ashram still exists. I wanted to be loyal to my principles of satyagraha and stand my ground in Ahmedabad. The Ahmedabad people have not deserted me, they come to see me and I enjoy their goodwill. This is so simply because I had bound them with the chain of love and I was confident that I would get the reward of my love from Ahmedabad
 
 itself. Shri Fulchand is a man who will stick to his post as I did. Why should he run away from Wadhwan? He should not desert his post even if has to starve. If he does anything in anger or out of obstinacy, or says anything to hurt you, that would be sin. If, however, his words spring from love, they will touch your heart. God alone knows with what feelings he acts; the result will depend on what they are.

  SPEECH AT OPENING OF NURSERY SCHOOL, 	WADHWAN 
 February 21, 1925
 I am supposed to take away with me this lock and key, as also this trowel which has not been soiled with earth at all. The gold coins which Shri Dhorajiwala has given to me, I will hand over to Fulchan- dbhai. Both these things have a meaning. A good many activities are going on in the country at present; who can say how many of them are genuine, or what self-sacrifice and sincerity of effort lie behind them? I, for one, do not know. All that I know is that of the  innumerable institutions which are being run in the country at present, a few, we can say, have life in them. An English poet has said, describing Heaven, that St. Peter stands guard at its gate, and the key with which he opens the gate is of iron and not of gold.libtech_397_footnotelibtech_398_footnoteExplaining this, another poet has said that it is not easy to open the gate of Heaven, that it cannot be opened with a key made of gold since gold is a rather soft metal, whereas iron is supposed to be one of the strongest metals. The gate, therefore, can be opened only with a key made of iron. Here in Kathiawar we say of a very difficult task that it is as difficult as chewing iron pellets. Running an institution like this is   a task of that kind. For building the walls of a library, a trowel made of silver can be of no use. We need one made of iron. Likewise, we cannot use a silver padlock for locking its doors. We must have an iron one. There is, thus, an artificiality about the first steps we have taken in  doing both these things. I  laid the  foundation  by   merely
 
 His keys were rusty, and the lock was dull.”
 spreading some earth; the work of building will be done  by  the masons and the doors of the temple [of knowledge] will be opened by the teachers. A library does not mean a building containing books, or the books in it, or idle visitors who do not read the books. Were it otherwise, we would find many booksellers to be men of character. Because the building of the nursery school is a fine one, and much money has been spent on it, can we say that the school will flourish? It will do so only if it gets the services of men who can run it on sound lines, only if it has a soul in it. Ordinarily Ido not like to perform the opening ceremony of such institutions, for how does it help me to do so? But I agreed to perform the opening ceremony of this because I have faith in the workers who are behind it. That is all. You should not suppose that any particular good will follow because I have performed the opening ceremony. I am a bird ever on the wing. Today I am here, tomorrow I may be in Ahmedabad and the day after in Delhi. However, I welcome your exploiting my name to do what good you can. The survival of this library will not depend on the support of the rich, or on the children using it or on anyone donating a hundred thousand gold coins. On the contrary, all that money may prove to be an obstacle. It has been my experience that whenever I received much help in money the cause suffered. At the time of the struggle in South Africa, as soon as money poured in from this country the movement lost its vigour, in the same way that Yudhishthira’s cha-riot  came down a little nearer the earth when he said: “Whether man or elephant I do not know.”libtech_399_footnotelibtech_400_footnoteGod has given only 24 hours to all of us, and all that we require for that length of time can be obtained by eight hours’ work. Everyone should be satisfied with that. This is my reason for not wishing that this institution should prosper financially. It should have only enough to enable the workers to keep body and  soul together while they serve it; they will lay down their lives for it if they find it necessary to do so.
 I would describe an institution which had plenty of money but no more than five workers as one which had come up like a  mushroom. It will survive for five days and then perish as the
 
 
 mushrooms do. The point of what I have been saying is that the workers who are attending this meeting and have pledged themselves to lay down their lives for it, should put their faith in god and, even when they feel that they are drowning, they should cling to their faith and keep swimming. If they do not act thus, you may be certain that they will invite upon themselves the curses of the country, for they will not have justified this imposing building. Such palatial buildings may be all right for Princes and Rulers, but this building may be all right for Princes and Rulers, but this building will become the poverty of the country, if we do not justify it by an appropriate return to the country by way of service and if the workers do not feel haunted by it as by a ghost so long as they have not been able to render such return. The establishment of this institution and my performing its opening ceremony will have been justified if Shri Fulchand and his co-workers live in it as men who had given up all attachment, even as king Janaka was known to have done though he lived in a palace. If, however, the spirit of renunciation vanishes and love of comfort comes to prevail in its place, the institution is bound to perish. That school alone is a national school which helps us to win swaraj and all whose teachers abide by the rules, are inspired by a spirit of self-sacrifice and lead an austere life.
 I was pained to hear that the citizens of Wadhwan have boy- cotted this institution. Money should be available locally for an institution for as long as it is in need, and the workers who run it should also be able to win the goodwill of the local population. The position of public workers like us who are fighting for swaraj is difficult, for they are also reformers. A reformers finds himself in an anomalous position, for he is not able to enter the atmosphere of the locality and is content to receive that help he can get from outside. Otherwise, what connection can Dr. Mehta of Rangoon have with this school? Wadhwan contributed to the fund even though they knew Shri Fulchand’s views about serving Antyajas; I do not understand, then, why the people have boycotted him now. I should like them to come and put their point of view to me, tell me what they feel.
 A national institution means one which strengthens the nation’s soul, and not merely one which is not connected with the Government in any way. A national institution flourishes on the foundation of character, it does not become national by having a large number of pupils and enabling them to make a living. They are indeed welcome to work for their livelihood; but it is not the aim of education to equip
 them for that purpose. Its aim is to awaken the pupil’s soul, to bring out his spiritual powers, to train his body, intellect and soul. I am told that such a large number of pupils are enrolled in the school at Wankaner because its results at examinations are one hundred per cent. This a narrow way of measuring its worth.
 Probably it is true that the teachers there are good; however, the children are enrolled there not in the hope that they will learn from the teachers to live virtuous lives, but in the expectation that because of the teachers’ efficiency they will pass the examinations. We must abandon this narrow criterion. The Vidyapith and the national schools exist in order that we may learn to do so. I urge the parents, therefore, to support such institutions, and urge the teachers to remain loyal to their ideals, to welcome suffering and to draw the pupils to them by the strength of their character. If they succeed in this, my coming here and performing the opening ceremony will have been fully rewarded.

  MY NOTES 
 KHADI IN UTKAL
 From Calcutta Shri Shankerlal Banker writes about Utkal, i.e., Orissa:libtech_401_footnote
 There is no other province as poor as Utkal. Khadi work, therefore, could progress better there than anywhere else. But the above letter tells us that the work done there is the poorest. The reason is well known. Where food is scarce, energy and enthusiasm for work disappear. If good workers are steadily forthcoming, Utkal can be trusted to overtake all other provinces.
 YARN IN ADDITION TO KHADI
 A gentleman writes: “Will it not be much better if, instead of purchasing hand-spun yarn and sending it to you, we send you the requisite amount for khadi and wear it?” There is a misunderstanding behind this question. The Congress has demanded not one of the two things, but both of them. First, everyone should send 2,000 yards of hand-spun yarn every month whether spun by oneself or someone
 
 
 else. Secondly, everyone should wear khadi. And so there is no alternative, but the two together are obligatory. A mere spinner cannot become a Congress member nor can a mere khadi-wearer. And this is quite right. By making spinning universal we shall increase the production of khadi and by making the use of khadi universal we shall increase the consumption of khadi. That along will remove starvation from India.
 A WOMAN’S OBJECTION
 This gentleman further writes: “When I went to persuade a woman to wear khadi, she objected: ‘If I wear khadi, my husband may be attracted by a woman using foreign or mill-cloth and thus lose his character.” I cannot expect such a reply from any virtuous woman. But since the issue has been raised it should be considered. If any husband deviates from his moral course simply because his wife observes simplicity or performs her duty, then the  virtuous  wife  should scarcely care for him. A man’s character is not worth anything if he could be tempted merely by another woman’s clothes.  A  husband who is seduced by a change in dress can also be seduced by a more beautiful woman.
 My experience, however, is contrary to the statement of this woman. I know hundreds of husbands who have been delighted to find their wives in khadi clothes. Their household expenditure has been reduced and their love for their khadi-clad wives has grown. But it is also possible that this sister had no mind to use khadi and so unawares she might have raised this unworthy objection. I appeal to the sisters who think like her to take boldly to khadi and realize that beauty does not consist in dress but in purity of character, and clothes are not meant for adornment but for protecting the body from heat and cold.
 WHAT SHALL WE DO?
 Two residents of Jetpur had sent me the following letterlibtech_402_footnoteto my Jetpur address:
 The description is correct. We can hardly emerge out of the enervating atmosphere without the strength of will. The class to which the above correspondents belong suffers from the ailment of idleness. Being accustomed to earn their wealth by means of cunning, they do
 
 not like to earn it by physical labour. Wants have multiplied and so the meagre earnings from physical labour cannot satisfy them. Unwarranted expenses on such heads as marriages and deaths have all soared so high that they cannot be met without incurring debts or earning by unfair means. The body cannot undertake the tiller’s toil; nor is there the requisite capital or skill. All that is left is the spinning- wheel. Here the wheel symbolizes not only spinning but all the processes of cloth production. This is an occupation that requires very little capital and also very little physical strength. This can offer a good livelihood if one gives up the prevalent pomp, simplifies living and sheds lethargy. If the correspondents cultivate a little more will- power, they can with moderate efforts learn spinning and weaving and thus earn their living.
The earnings from weaving are not enough yet, because khadi
 has not caught the fancy of the people. But with the spread of khadi many of us will take to weaving as a profession or earn our bread by honest trade in khadi. In short, if these gentlemen can promise some little effort they should seek admission to any khadi training centre. In Kathiawar, there is one such institution at Madhada. And the Political Conference has made spread of khadi its main activity in Kathiawar these days. The correspondents can consult its secretary and find a solution to their problem. They should remember that in this occupation there is no room for parasites.
 KHADI EXHIBITION
 In describing the Khadi Exhibition organized during the anniversary celebrations of the Supa Gurukul, the manager of its khadi section writes:libtech_403_footnote
 If such exhibitions are held occasionally, they will  certainly result in the spread of khadi and the spinning-wheel.

  INTERVIEW TO ASSOCIATED PRESS OF INDIA 
 AHMEDABAD,
 February 22, 1925 Mr. Gandhi has arrived in his Satyagraha Ashram this morning after visiting  Rajkot, Porbunder, Wankaner and Wadhwan in Kathiawar. He also visited on his way back Ganod Garashia centre. He met the Princes of all these States and was much
 
 struck by the solicitude they seemed to evince for the welfare of their subjects. People of all these States whom he met also spoke highly of their Princes. The experiment that His Highness the Thakore Saheb of Rajkot is making with a Representative Assembly he has founded, says Mr. Gandhi, is deeply interesting, though it is yet too early to give any definite opinion about it. From what he has come to know of it, however, makes him hopeful of success. Wankaner has made primary education compulsory in Wankaner itself and amongst the higher classes.
 Mr. Gandhi remarked:
 It is sign of the times that in all these places I noticed among the people the keenest desire for total prohibition. In Rajkot it is most keen-ly felt, because there an unhealthy an ugly competition is going on bet-ween the State liquor shops and the Civil Station liquor shops. The result is that the prices have considerably gone down and the lower classes are taking to liquor more than ever before. Their womenfolk are bitterly complaining about the havoc that is being played in their families owing to men returning day after day in a drunken state. People are urging the Thakore Saheb to abolish liquor shops altogether. The latter is reluctant to do so on the ground of individual liberty. He is of opinion that temperance should be brought about by preaching. The State Assembly has unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Darbar to close all licensed liquor shops, and prohibit distillation of liquor except for medicinal purposes, if necessary. It will be interesting to learn how the Thakore Saheb deals with this resolution.

SABARMATI,
 February 23, 1925
 
MY DEAR FRIEND & BROTHER,
 I have read today your commentary on my statement on Kohat. I honour you and love you all the more for your out-spokenness. But your commentary shows how with all the detachment and impartiality in the world sometimes people most closely related as we are can come to opposite conclusions on identical facts. It makes me more charitable than ever towards opponents and more distrustful of my judgment even than I am. I have twice read your commentary and I see the wide gulf that separates us in the affair. I am prepared to strongly condemn the publication of the poem but I am unable to condone the looting and arson. I do not endorse your opinion that the pamphlet was the cause of the conflagration. The ground was already prepared. I cannot treat the conversions as lightly as you seem to do. In my opinion the Khilafatists have greatly neglected their duty and Maulvi Ahmed Gul certainly betrayed the trust reposed in him.
 I do not say these things to influence your opinion if there is no cause for it. But I do want you to look more deeply into the facts than you have done and see whether there is cause for reconsideration. I tremble to publish our statements. The publication will give rise to an acrimonious discussion. I would therefore even suggest the whole matter being examined by Hakim Saheb or Dr. Ansari. I would love to have new light on the question. I would like all the friends to look at the facts and try to influence us both. But if after we have exhausted all our resources to come to a joint conclusion, we fail, we must dare to let the public know our difference of opinion and know too that we shall still love one another and work together. But that very love demands that we take no hasty action. Are you coming to Delhi? If you are, let us travel together. I leave by the metergauge on 27th. But if you are coming and you would rather leave by the Punjab Mail I would join you at Baroda. It may be advisable to have leisurely discussion between us. The train seems to be the best place for such discussion. Do let me know what you would like to do. Please wire if
 possible. I am not publishing the statement this week.
With love,
 
 
[PS.]

Courtesy: Beladevi Nayyar and Dr. Sushila Nayyar     SPEECH AT AHMEDABADlibtech_418_footnote     February 	25, 1925  	Prayer time is the best time for words of blessing. On two earlier 	occasions, when young people who grew up in the Ashram were married 	off, many among us did not appreciate the significance of the 	occasion. Whoever comes to the Ashram, whether children or married 	men, would like to observe brahmacharya; and, therefore, how 	can marriage be solemnized in the Ashram where is the aim  is  to 	encourage everyone in the observance of brahmacharya ? It is 	natural that the question should arise in the minds of many people; 	and yet three marriages came to be solemnized here. Though the 	regulations of the Ashram are strict, we are unable to enforce 	discipline. It is not easy to impart training in brahmacharya to 	young persons. Not that older folk are able to observe brahmacharya 	strictly. To fulfil an ideal, one should have ardour in one’s 	heart. The subject is so profound that the more I delve into it, the 	more aweinspiring it seems and I see its beauty and drink deep of 	its delights.  	We can’t use force on the young people whom we keep in the Ashram. 	It happens sometimes that marriages cannot be avoided.     Vide 	also “My Notes”, 	29-3-1925. 
 There were three such cases. In order to pacify my mind I took the one way out. The ceremonial should be performed outside the precincts of the Ashram. One should get married without deceiving the inner self or the outer world. And then one should come to the Ashram and receive everyone’s blessings.
 If marry one must, it should not be to indulge the senses but to practise self-control—this must be made clear to the married couple as well as the inmates of the Ashram. Inmates should not eagerly look forward to wedding occasions. It is a different matter if they can’t be avoided. That is an event linking the soul and God. That is why in English the soul is feminine in gender. Jaydev has also descried the soul as a feminine entity sporting with the Supreme Being. Little remains to be done in this world after such marriage of spirits. If marriages must take place even when this union of souls does not obtain, well, let it be so. It is necessary for me to tell you on this, the fourth, occasion that marriage is not meant for greed but for sacrifice. Resolve that even if you wish to derive sense pleasure from this relationship, you will do so within limits. Among us the rule of fidelity is meant for women only, though the last four morsels given to [the couple] while solemnizing the marriage stand for the union of flesh, spirit and bone. It is a pity we did not lay down a similar rule for men. Therefore I can only say that you must live in moderation and realize that the pleasures of the body should be only a means of procreation.
 Who has the right to give birth to a child in these terrible times? Countless persons in India observe brahmacharya and many  in  Europe as well. Among Roman Catholics, there are many adult men and women who observe brahmacharya throughout their life. An eighteen-year-old girl walks out of worldly life andobserves unbroken brahmacharya. They have monastries and nunneries where such men and women live. In these hard times no one in India has the right to beget children. No one has at any time the right to bear children before one is strong enough.
 I wanted the marriage to be solemnized in the Ashram, because the priest performing the rites would explain their significance and you could thus learn that marriage is not a matter of pleasure but of self-control. Both of you, therefore, should understand this occasion and remember it. I have taken upon myself one responsibility and I will never regret it. The result is bound to be beneficent. You know my relations with Vallabhbhai. He asked me of his own free will that
 this marriage be solemnized by me. Kashibhai was also favourable to the idea. There is no need for spending lots of money on a marriage. It is penance that is needed. Outside the Ashram a marriage cannot take place without money being spent, for you cannot have only the religious rite, leaving out things like  baratlibtech_419_footnote. That is why the marriage has been solemnized here. The seed that is sown will grow into a tree. But be worthy of your parents to nurture that seed and eschew worldly pleasures. For not spending money, the motive was not stinginess, and it certainly was not greed. Such expenditure bears heavily on the Patidar families and our intention was to save them from it altogether. I have known Dahyabhai for a long time and Yashoda too. I feel confident that they are strong enough through self-control to add lustre to this marriage. All these things which I say to inmates of the Ashram can-not be said too often. I do not mean to seek out such
 occasions, for that is not my vocation. But if they arise, I perform the ceremonies in the hope that self-control can be strengthened thus. This may well be an illu-sion. I do not wish not to take the chance if it comes. But I wish for all of you that you develop more self-control through such occasions. That is why we are all assembled here. Let us pray to God that we may attain our ideals and we may bring up men and women here who do not think about marriage and procreation, but who regard all children as their own, and who spend their lives in serving children who have no sunshine in their lives. Dahyabhai and Yashoda must think for themselves and realize how great is their responsibility. It seems to me as if they have lost their freedom today. But this state too can be beautiful. Let them be happy and restrained. Let them breathe the spirit of sacrifice and be worthy of their parents and also of us; so that no one may feel like asking why this marriage was celebrated in the Ashram.

  THE EMBARGO 
 I publish the following telegraphic correspondence between the Private Secretary to H.E. the Viceroy and myself.
 
 TELEGRAM TO THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO THE VICEROYlibtech_420_footnoteREPLY TO THE ABOVElibtech_421_footnote
 SECOND TELEGRAM TO PRIVATE SECRETARY TO THE VICEROYlibtech_422_footnote
 REPLY TO THE ABOVElibtech_423_footnote
 It is quite true that my going to Kohat is likely to reopen the settlement in so far as it is intrinsically bad. It is settlement brought about my coercion, for it has been arrived at under threat of prosecu- tions on either side. It is not a voluntary settlement that pleases the parties. Both the Hindus and the Mussalmans whom Maulana Shaukat Ali and I met at Rawalpindi said as much. But my visit to Kohat, whatever else it may or may not bring about, can never mean greater estrangement between the parties. If, therefore, I had been permitted together with Mussalman friends to proceed to Kohat it would have meant furtherance of peace which the Viceroy claims to have at heart equally with me. Whilst, therefore, I was able somewhat to understand the refusal when the things were still in a ferment, I am unable to understand the prohibition at the present moment. Friends were not wanting who suggested that I should have proceeded to Kohat without permission or intimation and taken the risk of a prohibition order. I could not do so unless I meant to disobey any such order and court imprisonment. And as I hold that there is no atmosphere at the present moment in the country for any such step I could  not  take  the proposed risk. I can only hope that the authorities will appreciate the deliberation with which I am avoiding every step that may precipitate civil resistance. My purpose so far as it is humanly possible is to avoid taking a single step that may even indirectly precipitate violence on the part of the people. But a time must come when non-violent resistance on my part may become a duty in total disregard of untoward consequences. I do not myself know when such a time can or will come. I know that it is a possibility. But when that time comes I hope that friends will not find me wanting. Till then I must ask them to bear with me.

  INHUMAN IF TRUE 
 Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee sends me the following telegram:
 Reports from Nabha just received give harrowing details of inhuman tortures including wholesale merciless beating to unconsciousness, dragging  by  keshas (hair) and beards, ducking into water, putting hot iron rods on various parts of body and hanging by their feet heads downward, resulting in several deaths at the spot. Many more are in a precarious condition. A large number is seriously wounded. No ration issued on 13th and 14th to some jathas libtech_424_footnote. Great excitement prevails. Situation extremely serious. Immediate action necessary.
 I print the telegram, but alas! what immediate action can be taken? Of Public sympathy the prisoners can be sure. I have little doubt that there will be questions and usual answers in the Assembly but of what use will they be to the sufferers? I can only hope that the picture is overdrawn and that the authorities are not guilty of the inhumanities ascribed to them. I trust that the Administrator of Nabha will give a full explanation about the awful charges brought against the prison authorities and court an impartial inquiry into the allegations.
 Young India, 26-2-1925
 
  MORE ABOUT VYKOM 
 The folllowing letter will be bread with painful interest by those Hindus who look upon untouchability as a crime:
 We have seen your articlelibtech_425_footnotein Young India about us. It is our fervent prayer that we do really deserve the high terms in which you have been kind enough to characterize our activities here. On reading it we have become to some extent depressed by the sense of our own shortcomings and we are strivings our utmost to come up to the level which will satisfy you when you come here and see things actually for yourself.
 In the meantime the local Legislative Council has thrown out “our resolution” by a majority of 22 to 21 votes. The Government majority was made up of 15 officials, 3 nominated members, one Brahmin representative of vested interests and three elected members. The constitution of the Council is
 
 15 officials, 7 nominated non-officials and 28 elected non-officials. So of the 35 non-officials 21 voted for us, two stood neutral, 7 against us and the rest were absent. And of the 7 who voted against us, as already stated three alone were elected from the general electorate. It is clear from the facts stated above that the Government, far from taking a neutral attitude, actually went the length of canvassing against the resolution. You may remember that, the Regent Maharani in her reply to the caste Hindu jatha expressed a desire to know the attitude of the councils before doing anything in the matter. Then we had expected that the Government would at least have kept a neutral attitude. But now we find that it is not so. It has now become clear that the Government is to a large extent acting as the real opposition where enlightened opinion is in favour of reform.
 But what, however, I wished to bring to your notice is this. The result of the resolution in the Council may prove the last straw on the camel’s back. There are signs everywhere of an impatience at the gentle and “slow” method of satyagraha. Even responsible leaders may fall victims to the general restlessness. So if it is absolutely impossible for you to go over here in the near future, it must be at least possible for you to issue an authoritative statement regarding the implications of satyagraha. Such a statement coming from you is bound to have the healthiest effect on minds that have begun to waver in the face of the present heavy odds. Some people have begun to advocate social ostracism of the high castes, non-co-operation and so many other methods, all of which are more or less dangerous in the present state of our society.
 Considerable strength of mind and perseverance is required now even to manage the Camp. But this is not the real difficulty. The matrix in which satyagraha flourished is the general communal consciousness and I only point out that after ten months of satyagraha when people realize that the Travancore Council has thrown out the “Freedom of Road” resolution, there is either a tendency to take to extreme steps or to completely collapse. Of these I am only afraid of the first and that is why I request that a message, clearly conveying to them all the implications of satyagraha, how though seemingly dilatory in its working yet it is the quickest agent for success, and how other methods are less useful if not positively harmful, especially in a “communal problem”, etc., is highly necessary. I hope you will find time to do so.
That a State reported to be advanced should work in opposition
 to progressive opinion is a sad commentary on its “advanced” state. The progressives really won the battle from a moral standpoint. Whilst it is regrettable that 22 should have voted against the use by the so- called untouchables of the public road in question, it is consoling to
 find that 21 members vindicated the position taken by the Hindu reformers by voting in favour of their resolution. The saddest part of the letter, however, is the fact that the satyagrahis seem to be losing hope. I do not wonder. Theirs is the first experience of sustained satyagraha. Let me, however, assure them that victory is assured. For their cause is just, their means non-violent. Let them realize, too, that by their sufferings they have attracted the attention of the world. Whoever knew Vykom before the struggle commenced? They should also know that they are fighting an age-long superstition. What is a year’s suffering on the part of a few reformers in their attempt to break down the iron wall of prejudice? To lose patience is to lose the battle. They must fight to the finish. What is the alternative anyone can have in view? The breaking of heads will not serve the purpose. Orthodoxy will stiffen its back and will suck nourishment out of the blood of its martyrs. For if the orthodox are injured, sympathy will irresistibly be drawn towards them though their cause is wrong. To attempt to force the entry will invite stronger barricades. And even if force succeeded, it would merely mean mechanical use of a single public road and not change of opinion.
 What, however, the Hindu reformers want is the conversion of the orthodox people who have made of untouchability a religion. This they will only do by sufferings such as they are now undergoing. Satyagraha is the shortest cut to success. All the reforms that have been brought about by violent methods have taken not one year but years. The victory of enlightenment over darkness in Europe was a long and torturing process. And one is not sure that it was a lasting success. There was no conversion of those who opposed and died. The others who were converted were attracted by the sufferings of those who died even whilst inflicting death on their opponents. The net legacy that age bequeathed the world was a confirmation of belief in methods of violence. I hope therefore that the satyagrahis of Vykom will not swerve from their path even though their ranks may  be thinned and victory may seem further off than ever. Satyagraha is utter self-effacement, greatest humiliation, greatest patience and brightest faith. It is its own reward.

  NOTES 
 28TH FEBRUARY
 The Sub-Committee appointed by the All-Parties Conference Committee is to meet once more on the 28th instant at Delhi. No Sub- Committee had perhaps a more difficult task before it. The Sub- Committee redivided itself into two groups, one for drafting a skeleton swaraj scheme and the other for framing a skeleton Hindu-Muslim Unity scheme. Dr. Besant was Chairman of the Swaraj group of the Sub-Committee and she has already presented a report for the consideration of the Sub-Committee. The adjournment took place for the consideration of the Hindu-Muslim question as no  agreement could be reached last time, and as the desire was expressed that the members then present should be able to confer with those who were absent and those others who though not members might be able to assist in reaching an agreement. It is to be hoped that those who can will attend the forthcoming meeting. Lala Lajpat Rai has telegraphed asking me to postpone the meeting to a date after the third week of March. Several members have informed him that they will not be able to attend. I have informed himlibtech_426_footnotelibtech_427_footnotesaying  that  I  could  not  postpone without reference to the meeting itself and that the meeting might postpone if it was thought desirable. Everybody has by this time made up his mind as to what should be done. No new light would possibly be thrown on the question at the forthcoming meeting. The only question for consideration would be whether there is a middle course between the two extremes that were discussed at Delhi at the last meeting. That leads to another question. Is there a will on the part of both the parties to find an immediate solution ? The swaraj scheme is also a tremendously important problem. Only, the Hindu-Muslim question seems to block all progress. I do hope that all who are at all able will come and assist the deliberations. I would advise the  absentees to send in their opinions lest the meeting should decide to continue its deliberations instead of postponing as suggested by Lalaji.
 ACHARYA GIDWANI RELEASED
The reader will share with me the joy of reading the following
 
 telegram received on Monday morning from Ambala:
 Gidwani released yesterday evening sentence being suspended again. Administrator’s order states facts correctly this time. Administrator sent word through his brother Alim Gidwani, who went to see him on the 8th instant to ask for appointment for Mrs. Gidwani that if Gidwani did not interfere in Nabha politics he could go away that day. Gidwani sent word that if that meant obedience to externment order he had no intention of disobeying it when he came and none in future. Mrs. Gidwani brought word on the 11th that that was what Administrator required, when Gidwani sent immediately following letter: “Mrs. Gidwani tells me that you desire some assurance from me that I have no intention of disobeying your externment order. I have not the slightest hesitation in giving you that assurance. When I started from Amritsar last year   I had no intention of disobeying the order when I wrote to you for permission to enter Jaito. As I explained in my written statement on 8th March 1924, I had fully intended to abide by your decision; my friends tell me that you did not get that letter in time which perhaps explains the unfortunate misunderstanding. The Congress position and Mr. Gandhi’s wishes in the matter which I had ascertained personally before starting required me to obey the order and my future course of action will of course be the same, obeying the order until it is withdrawn.” Administrator left for Delhi on 12th morning returned on 15th and had to go immediately to Jaito returning again on 21st night. The suspension order came at 4 a.m. on 22nd. Gidwani proceeding Delhi tonight staying with Principal, Hindu College, awaiting Mahatmaji’s instructions.
I rejoice to have the news of Acharya Gidwani’s release because
 his imprisonment was a gross injustice and because that injustice has been redressed. Truly the ways of the Nabha authorities are strange. What they have now received from the Acharya they could have had long ago. In fact as has been repeatedly pointed out in these columns, Acharya Gidwani never entered the Nabha boundary in order to defy orders. He entered purely and simply in order to perform  a humanitarian service. But neither the nation nor the Acharya has lost by the imprisonment. It is the necessary training for swaraj and the price that one must pay for liberty.
 STONING TO DEATH
 I have a long telegram sent to me as President of the National Congress regarding the stoning to death in Afghanistan of two members of the Ahmediya sect. I purposely refrained from any comment on the awful penalty imposed on the late Niamatulla Khan
 
 but I dare not ignore the incidents now reported especially when a personal appeal for expression of opinion is made to me. I understand that the stoning method is enjoined in the Koran only in certain circumstances which do not cover the cases under observation. But as a human being living in the fear of God I  should  question  the morality of the method under any circumstance whatsoever. Whatever may have been necessary or permissible during the Prophet’s lifetime and in that age, this particular form of penalty cannot be defended on the mere ground of its mention in the Koran. Every formula of every religion has in this age of reason, to submit to the acid test of reason and universal justice if it is to ask for universal assent. Error can claim no exemption even if it can be supported by the scriptures of the world. I extend my sympathy to the sect in its distress. Needless to say I can express no opinion on the merits of the case. I do not think the public has any data for forming an opinon on merits. It is the form penalty that wounds the human conscience. Both reason and heart refuse to reconcile themselves to torture for any crime, no matter how vile the crime may be.
 SOME POSERS
“A well-wisher” sends these lines for my meditation:
 The Bible can be read in 566 languages. In how many can the Upanishads and the Gita?
 How many leper asylums and institutions for the depressed and the distressed have the missionaries? How many have you?
It  is  usual  for  me   to   receive  such  posers.   “A  well-wisher”
 deserves an answer. I have great regard for the missionaries for their zeal and self-sacrifice. But I have not hesitated to point out to them that both are often misplaced. What though the Bible were translated in every tongue in the world? Is a patent medicine better than the Upanishads for being advertised in more languages than the Upanishads? An error does not become truth by reason of multipled propagation, nor does truth become error becase nobody will see it. The Bible was a greater power when the early fathers preached it than it is today. “A well-wisher” has little conception of the way truth works, if he thinks that the translation of the Bible in more languages than the Upanishads is any test of its superiority. Truth has to be lived if it is to fructify. But if it is any satisfaction to “A well-wisher” to have my answer I may gladly tell him that the Upanishads and the Gita have been translated into far fewer languages than the Bible. I
 have never been curious enough to know in how many languages they are translated.
 As for the second question, too, I must own that the missionaries have founded many leper asylums and the like. I have founded none. But I stand unmoved. I am not competing with the missionaries or anybody else in such matters. I am trying humbly to serve humanity as God leads me. The founding of leper asylums, etc., is only one of the ways, and perhaps not the best, of serving humanity. But even such noble service loses much of its nobility when conversion is the motive behind it. That service is the noblest which is rendered for its own sake. But let me not be misunderstood. The missionaries that selflessly work away in such asylums command my respect. I am ashamed to have to confess that Hindus have become so callous as to care little for the waifs and strays of India, let alone the world.
 A SUPERSTITION
 A Bengal zamindar sends me a long letter dealing with Hindu- Muslim unity, untouchability and swaraj. The letter is too long for publication and covers no new ground. I cull, however, one typical sentence from it. It is:
 For over 500 years the relation between Hindus and Mussalmans was that of foes. After the advent of British rule both the Mussalmans and Hindus were compelled out of policy to forget that racial hatred and the acrimony of that bitter enmity is now no more. But the permanent difference in the constitution of these two races does even now exist. I believe the present cordial relation is due to British rule and not to the catholicity of modern Hinduism.
 I regard this statement as pure superstition. The two races lived at peace among themselves during the Mussalman rule. Let it be remembered that many Hindus embraced Islam before the advent of Muslim rule in India. It is my belief that had there been no Muslim rule, there would still have been Mussalmans in India even as there would have been Christians had there been no British rule. There is nothing to prove that Hindus and Mussalmans lived at war with one another before the British rule. My belief is that the British policy of “divide and rule” has accentuated our differences and will continue to do so, till we recognize that we must unite in spite of the policy. This cannot and will not happen unless we refrain from a scramble for place and power. The beginning must be made by the Hindus.
 BHARUCHA’S DIARY
 Here is a record of Mr. Bharucha’s work:
 Am touring in East Khandesh with Messrs Dastane and Deva. Here is the
 
 diary:
 13-2-25 Bhusaval—Khadi Rs. 350 sold principally to lawyers and cotton collection 12 Bengali maunds.
   2  Bengali 	maunds. 
  15-2-25 	Chalisgaon—Khadi sold to lawyers Rs. 310/- and to cloth merchants 	Rs. 450/-. Cotton collection 1 Bengali maund.  16-2-25 	Pachora—Cotton collection 12 Maunds and at Sindurni 5 maunds pucka 	Bengali.  17-2-25 	Today we are at Yaval. Mr. Dastane wants three days more for West 	Khandesh, i.e., up to 23rd instant. I 	reproduce this extract from one of Mr. Bharucha’s letters as  	spur to action by the other workers. Not without business-like and 	continuous effort is success possible in the spinning and khaddar 	propaganda. My experience is that wherever there is work put in, the 	response is quick.  INDIA’S 	PLIGHT  	Mr. Higginbottom of the Agricultural Institute of Allahabad was 	examined by the Taxation Inquiry Committee on the 6th instant when 	he gave expression to interesting opinions on several matters of 	importance. I cull the following from theCivil and Military 	Gazette:  India, 	while being poor, is the most extravagant country on the face of the 	earth in matters of agriculture. The extreme poverty in the land is 	not so much due to want of either land or material for agriculture 	but want of a scientific system of agriculture. The existence of 	numerous uneconomic cattle and religious mendicants are the source 	of a fearful economic drain on the country. There are far too many 	cattle for food supply, and there are too many cattle for the work 	to be done. Lack of food reduces the size and value of cattle. Lack 	of food and the refusal to eliminate unfit ones has led to the 	Indian cow giving the least amount of milk of any cow on the earth. 	Indian milk is most expensive to produce and over 90 per cent of the 	cattle in this country is an economic loss. . .  The 	most expensive manure, which is difficult to get, is being burnt by 	the people.  The 	potential taxability of 	India is 	very great, but 	her present taxable 	capacity is 	very low. The 	burden of 	the land 	tax is 	very much lower than what 	it ought to 	be. Land revenue 	in India 	is burdensome 	when the holding 	is smaller 	than an economic holding.  Legislation 	is necessary 	for abolishing 	uneconomic holdings. 	 The present 	legislation was 	putting a 	premium on 	small farming. 	The size 	of a 
 holding is seldom sufficiently large for the use of labour-saving machinery. The present state of legislation is making all economic holdings to become a number of uneconomic holdings. There is absence of a proper system of village industries to take care of the surplus people. Further the land is asked to provide a whole-time living for a very large number of men and animals who can work on it only for half the time. The remedy is to devise and devlop rural seasonal industries for men, women and oxen so that they can be gainfully occupied for a portion of the time when the land does not require their services.
 The landlord regards his income as personal, and does not consider the improvement of the countryside as his gain. Moreover, tenants and landlords are eternally at war.
These extracts deal with four things. Waste of valuable manure,
 the distressing problem of cattle, uneconomic holdings and want of occupation for the peasantry all the year round. All these, apart from the burden of taxation, deepen the poverty of the masses and deserve conside-ration at the hands of all patriots. Everyone of them is capable of being handled in an effective manner. In a country where the cow is an object of worship, there should be no cattle problem at all. But our cow-worship has resolved itself into an ignorant fanati- cism. The fact that we have more cattle than we can support is a matter for urgent treatment. I have already suggested the taking over of the question by cow-protection societies. It is their legitimate function. The question of uneconomic holdings requires revision of the family system. The question of wanton destruction of manure requires a true agricultural education and that of unemployment for half the year for millions of men and women can only be solved by the spinning- wheel. It is clear that to the fight with the Government we must add a scientific study and handling of the problems discussed by Mr. Sam Higginbottom.

Vykom	March 8
 The programme after that will be decided in Vykom. I expect to return to the Ashram on 26th March. I have to be at Botad on the 1st April and then I have to go to Madhada, Palitana, Sihor, etc.
 Now I can see the Jam Saheb only after my return from Vykom;  I would come to Bombay, provided he goes there.
 Herewith Bhai Fulchand’s letter. I have a very high opinion of him. This is an example of how the best of men are deceived by rumours. I am sure you will forgive Bhai Fulchand. When he of his own accord wrote to me saying that he would apologize I asked him to send the letter of apology to me.

 Don’t I go to people who do not wear khadi? The cause of prohibition would gain nothing directly by my doing as you suggest. Our not drinking despite going to his place does help it.
 If we would have no such relations, we should leave society altogether.

  REMINISCENCES OF KATHIAWAR-1 
 PEOPLE’S REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY
 The memories of my visit to Kathiawar, which lasted from the 15th to 21st , will ever remain fresh in my mind. I was delighted to see the independence displayed by the Thakore Saheb of Rajkot. I had my misgivings about the usefulness of the People’s Representative Assembly, but my presence during this body’s deliberations for three hours dispelled them. The ultimate benefit from this organization would be known only in the future but it can be said that it is useful even in its present form. It rests with the representatives to increase its utility. The representatives have complete freedom to express themselves and they were seen exercising this to the full. Nobody seemed to worry about what views the Thakore Saheb would approve. The representatives expressed even such views as were likely to offend the Thakore Saheb.
 
 As the proceedings were conducted in Gujarati, the atmos- phere was lively. Here was none of the artificiality, snobbery, and so on that one finds in English speeches. Some speeches, one could say, were excellent and effective. The speeches did not drag on and most of them were to the point. I would not consider this council inferior to any other assembly in respect of debating ability, self-restraint and orderly procedure.
 Prohibition was the main topic discussed by the Assembly. It unanimously passed a resolution to the effect that the Durbar should ban the distillation of liquor. The representatives knew that the Thakore Saheb was opposed to this resolution. And yet it was passed a second time.
 A FLAW IN ARGUMENT
 The Thakore Saheb had himself argued with the representatives. Hence his views on this subject could be known. He argued that if drink shops were banned, individual liberty would be curtailed. I think that there is a great flaw in this argument. It is difficult to understand how individual liberty is curtailed if liquor shops are closed down. People did not want drinking to be considered a crime, but they wanted a ban on the preparation and sale of liquor. No society or individual is entitled to prepare or sell a thing if it is considered harmful by them. Everyone is aware of the harm done by drinking. As there can be no liberty for anyone to steal, there can be none to distil or sell liquor. Those who cannot do without liquor  may transgress the law. Many instances of such restrictions are found even in countries where individual liberty is cherished. Liberty and license are not the same thing. One cannot have the license to act as one pleases. If such license exists, then the goddess of liberty can never stay there. Everyone has the right to enjoy as much liberty as will not harm others. There is a legal maximlibtech_445_footnotelibtech_446_footnotein English that one should use one’s property in such a way that others are not injured. I have every right to dig up my whole plot of land but I cannot dig it so that the foundation of my neighbour’s house is damaged. If a section of the people drinks wine, the evil consequences are not suffered by the drinkers alone but their children and neighbours also suffer. America has closed down drink shops and breweries. That has not resulted in
 
 the curtailment of individual liberty. When the whole world loudly protests against the drink trade, it is regrettable that the Thakore Saheb of Rajkot is defending individual liberty to drink.
 PUBLIC OPINION
 Assuming that the ban on the drink trade would  curtail individual liberty, even then, if the people clearly hold a unanimous view, it is the duty of the ruler to act according to the wishes of the people. That is a principle recognized all over the world. There was no one in the People’s Representative Assembly who did not desire a ban on the drink trade. There is evidence to show that the addicts themselves desire such a ban. Their families have suffered. It will be regrettable if the Thakore Saheb does not respect the wishes of the people in this matter. The ruler has taken the initiative in forming the People’s Representative Assembly, and I would expect that he will not disregard the people’s wish clinging to wrong reasoning and that he will earn the sincere blessings of the poor by banning the drink trade.
 REGULARITY
 The Thakore Saheb of Rajkot is a stickler for regularity. He does all his work at the appointed hour and diligently goes through all his appointments, and makes others do the same. He loves discipline. He believes that our greatest drawback is lack of discipline. That this is very much so cannot be denied. The people are not able to fulfil their good intentions for want of rules and discipline.

 I am sorry that I am silent. But you can say what you wish to. I will answer by writing. I am very busy editing Young India—but I will spare a few minutes.
 INFLUENCE OF CHARKHA
It is not so much the individual I have in view as the nation. The
 
 
 effect of spinning on the individual may be imperceptible but its  effect on the nation will be very considerable even as the work of a single soldier plodding at a trench may be nothing, but the cumulative effect of thousands working at it may turn the scale.
 POSITION OF BROWBEATING SECTION OF INDEPENDENTS
 They threaten to take a leading part. But they will not succeed. India’s heart is not that way. What you have seen of brutality is, I hope, confined to a very narrow group.
 POSSIBILITY OF AMICABLE SETTLEMENT WITH ENGLAND
Certainly there is every possibility. I am working to that end.
But the thing largely depends upon English conduct as a whole.

 I kept your letter by me all this time. I can see nothing to except in Maulana Mahomed Ali’s statement.libtech_450_footnoteMay not a man seven feet tall say of another five feet in height that the former is superior to the latter in height, although the latter is superior to the former in every other respect? May not the Maulana truthfully say that he is superior to the so-called greatest man in the world in so far at least as the Maulana believes a religion which in his opinion is the best of all? I think the Maulana has legitimately drawn the contrast.

 You 	were kind enough to ask Maulana Mahomed Ali to let me

I am entirely in favour of the Mussalmans in the Punjab and Bengal having representation in accordance with their numbers. But I have been unable to follow the argument in favour of separate electorates. Its working seems to be proving unsatisfactory almost everywhere. And if you have separate electorates for one community you can hardly resist such a claim on behalf of the others and finally by sub-sects. This must mean ruin of nationalism. Have you given a thought to the proposal made by me?
 I hope you are better and stronger than when I met you. I wish it was possible for us to meet again and oftener.

  From 	the manuscript of Mahadev Desai’s Diary.

We were also 	required and authorized by the meeting to give a resume of the 	position as it stands today. The meeting was attended by very few 	members—14 out of 53. They were Maulana Mahomed Ali, Maulana 	Shaukat Ali, Swami Shraddhanand, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr. S. 	Datta, Mr. Ahmed Ali, M.L.A., Raja Ahmad Ali Khan of Salempur, Nawab 	Sir Sahibzada Abdul Quiyum, Mr. Mohamed Yakub, Mr. N.M. Joshi, Mr. 	N.C. Kelkar, besides ourselves Mr. Jinnah came in for a few minutes 	from another meeting (Independent Party’s meeting) he was 	attending at that time.  	Lala Lajpat Rai had asked for a postponement by reason of the 	inability of Messrs Jayakar,Srinivasa Iyengarlibtech_454_footnotelibtech_455_footnoteand 	Jairamdas to attend. We were unable to postpone the meeting on our 	own responsibility. We, therefore, informed Lala Lajpat Rai that the 	question of postpone- ment be placed before the meeting. This was 	consequently done. But apart from the absence of Lala Lajpat Rai and 	of  the  gentlemen named by him the attendance was otherwise also 	too meagre for     
 coming to any decision. In our opinion there was moreover no material for coming to any definite conclusions. Nor is there likeli- hood of any being reached in the near future. We, therefore, see no hope of being able to convene a general meeting of the Conference within the prescribed period except upon a requisition referred to by us. The failure to reach a decision is likely to disapoint the public. We would, however, advise publicists and others not to despond. That the Sub-committee has not been able to reach any decision is no reason for individuals or groups to relax their effort towards a solution.
 There still remains to mention the swaraj scheme framed by the Sub-committee under Dr. Besant. Dissenting notes are being received by us from the members of that committee. In view, however, of the meagre attendance and the failure to reach a decision on the Hindu- Muslim problem the scheme could not be considered by the meeting.

  NOTES-I 
 HINDU-MUSLIM PROBLEM
 The reader will see from the statement published in the Press that the Sub-committee of the All-Party Conference has not been able to come to any decision on the problem of problems. But perhaps it was as well that it did not. The atmosphere for a reasonable solution is lacking. Each distrusts the other. In such circumstances there can be no common ground of action. Each necessarily wants to surrender as little as possible. Nor does one notice a real anxiety on the part of any of the parties for a solution. There is, however, no cause for despair. The present failure may be a stepping-stone to success, if those who can trust and who have no fear of one another will be true to their faith and try to work at a solution. Any solution to be national must disregard the Government, i.e., must have inherent working power and must not depend for its proper working upon the goodwill of the Government.
 HELPLESSNESS
 I have a long telegram describing a daring dacoity attempted in Sukkur at 10 p.m. on the 22nd near the Police Station and in the heart of the town. The telegram adds that the bankers are feeling unsafe and that the dacoits are still uncaught. The object of the telegram no doubt is to excite public sympathy and criticism of a Government the most expensive in the world and yet failing to afford simple protection to life and property. That sympathy the citizens of Sukkur  have. Criticism of the Government they may also have by the cartload. But the more relevant question is what the bankers were doing when the dacoits came. From the telegram it would appear that they more or
 
 less successfully attempted self-defence. Those who would keep the possessions cannot have too much power of self-defence. When the helpless cry of robbery comes under my notice, I think more of the weakness of the robbed than of the incapacity of the Government to protect. Law allows the right of self-defence. Human dignity demands the courage to defend oneself. It would be a training in swaraj if the people everywhere instead of looking to the authority to defend their lives, property and honour would learn to rely upon themselves for self-defence.
 A CRY FROM SYLHET
 Here is a pathetic appeal from Sylhet in support of the invitation to visit that District:
 Although our present may not justify us in giving you trouble, we have a past which may not fail to draw your sympathy. Ours is a peculiar position. Politically we are under the administration of the Government of Assam, but we have a close inseparable affinity with Bengal in all matters, linguistic, social, religious and political. This District Congress Committee is within the jurisdiction of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee.
 During the palmy days of non-co-operation this province of Assam including our district was perhaps a victim of bureaucratic wrath next only to the Punjab.
 Tea-garden-labour exodus, the incidents of tearing Koran at Maijbhag and lastly the tragedy of Kanaighat had introduced this district to the rest of India.
 The “Law and Order” exacted a punitive tax of two lacs more or less from this district containing about 26 lacs of souls.
 Nearly 200 national workers were imprisoned.
 This ruthless repression dealt a fatal blow to the Congress activities. Many went to their respective callings and hence there is a miserable fall in our ranks.
 Out of ten national schools we have only one dragging its weary life. About 20,000 handlooms are at work, but, alas, with the exception of a very few, almost all work in foreign yarn. Sufficient quantity of cotton is being exported by the foreign capitalist year by year from our hills.
 The past record of Sylhet is undoubtedly brilliant. But no nation can live merely upon its past. A glorious past may be, ought to be, an inspiration for the present. But the future can only be determined by the present conduct. It is, therefore, necessary for the people in the Sylhet District to bestir themselves and make the constructive
 
 programme a success so far as their part of the country is concerned. It is a sad reflection that all over the country the imprisonment left the people paralysed. If we had understood the secret of suffering, they should have invigorated us instead of enervating us as they did in general. It ought not to be beyond the ability of the people of Sylhet to intercept some of the cotton that leaves their district nor to persuade the weavers to weave hand-spun yarn and to supply them with such yarn spun in their own district. Then and not till then will they be entitled to ask me to visit them.
 THE BAR SINISTER
 General Smutslibtech_459_footnotehas at last spoken out on the proposed extension of the Colour Bar in South African Legislation. The reader will remember the cablegram received sometime ago that the Union Government was seeking to put the ban on Asiatics being employed in the mines. Speaking on and against that legislation General Smuts is reported to have said:
 In opposing the Colour Bar Bill in the Union Assembly, General Smuts declared that the Bill sought to give the Government power by regulation to apportion work in mines and works between whites on the one hand, and Natives and Asiatics on the other, which he thought was a very serious matter. He felt that the Bill was not honest dealing and it was his deliberate opinion that there was only one guarantee of the security of white civilization namely, honest justice between man and man in this country. (“Hear, hear!”) Turning to the Bill, as it affected Asiatics, he said that in the days of his negotiation with Mr. Gandhi the position which the latter took up, and which had been taken up at subsequent conferences in London, was an appeal not to dishonour Indians. “We recognize”, said Mr. Gandhi, “there is a difference between you and us and that distinctions must be made, but don’t cast a stigma on us in the laws of your country,” but in this Bill they were doing the very thing they were asked to avoid. They were gathering on their heads the hatred of the whole of Asia from one side to the other. In conclusion, he suggested that the matter should be seriously considered, whether they should not discharge the order for the second reading of the Bill, and see whether some way out of the difficulty could not be found.
General   Smuts   has   correctly   given    the    substance    of  my
conversation   with   him.   My   point   was   that   whilst administrative
 
 difference there was bound to be so long as human nature remained what it was and so long as there was a conflict between European culture and the Indian, a legal recognition of the difference in the shape of the introduction of the Bar sinister in the laws of the country was an intolerable burden. The settlement of 1914 chiefly consisted in the vindication of the Indian position. With General Smuts’  opposition we may hope that the Bill will now be dropped. But let us not deceive ourselves. The Natal Disfranchising Bill recently passed is an extension of the “Bar Sinister”. General Smut’ opposition therefore means only a protest against the bar being introduced even in the matter of employment, not against the bar altogether. However I tender my congratulations to General Smuts on his plain speech at the risk of still further weaken-ing his political position in his country. We may not be satisfied till the South African statute-book is purged of all legal inequality as between whites and Asiatics or better still as between white and coloured people.
 Young India, 5-3-1925
 
  GOD AND CONGRESS 
A friend writes:
 There is one matter on which I have been longing to approach you for an explanation. It is about the term “God”. As a national worker I would not have anything to say against such a passage as this occurring in a recent number of Young India: “I present it (Ramanama) to the reader whose vision is not blurred and whose faith is not damped by overmuch learning. Learning takes us through many stages in life, but it fails us utterly in the hour of danger and temptation. Then faith alone saves” (Young India, 22-1-’25, p.27).libtech_460_footnoteFor it is a confession of your individual faith; and I know also that you have not failed on occasions to put in a word of praise about conscientious atheists where it was deserved. As witness the following sentences in your Niti Dharma: “We come across many wicked men, priding themselves on their religiosity, while doing the most immoral deeds. On the other hand, there are also men like the late Mr. Bradlaughlibtech_461_footnotewho, while being extremely virtuous and moral, take pride in calling themselves atheists.” As for the faith in Ramanama which “alone saves us in the hour of danger and temptation”, I may mention the martyrdom
 
 
 of the rationalist Francisco Ferrer in 1909 at Barcelona in Spain at the hands of men who believed in Jesus’ name, their Ramanama. I shall not dwell on the Holy Wars, the burnings and mutilations of heretics, and the torture and slaughter of animals and sometimes of men in sacrifice—all of which have been carried out ""for the greater glory of God and in His name"". This is by the bye [sic].
 As a national worker, however, I feel, I must draw your attention to the objection which Mr.—raised (on behalf of a rationalist friend of his) to your saying that only “godfearing” men can become true non-co-operators, and remind you of the assurance you then gave to all to the effect that the programme of national work does not require a man to declare his religious faith. (Vide Young India, May 4, 1921 pp. 138-9)libtech_462_footnoteThat objection applies with greater force now than it did at that time, because “God” has now a place on pledges and vows such as that administered to Congress volunteers, which begins “with God as witness, I. . .” Now you must be knowing that the Buddhists (like the Burmese. . . now an “Indian” people, and your friend Prof. Dharmanand Kosambi) and the Jains, as well as many Indians who do not belong to these ancient recognized sects are agnostic in faith. Is it possible to these, if they wish, to enrol as Congress Volunteers conscientiously and with full understanding of a pledge which begins in the name of an Entity they ignore? I not, is it proper to exclude from Congress service any such merely because of their religious faith? May I suggest that a conscience clause be added to accommodate all such cases, allowing of solemn affirmation in place of the oath in the name of God (to which even some believers in a personal God object, as the Quakers), or else a substitution of “Conscience” in a place of “God” by all conscientious objectors to the use of the latter, or—best of all— that a solemn affirmation without reference to God and with or without “Conscience” be required of all comers without distinction? I approach you as you are the author of that pledge and now the President of the Congress. I did so once before, but I am afraid, not in time for you to be able to attend to it before you historic arrest at Sabarmati in 1922.
 So far as the conscientious objection is concerned the mention of God may be removed if required from the Congress pledge of which I am proud to think I was the author. Had such an objection been raised at the time, I would have yielded at once. I was unpre- pared for the objection in a place like India. Though there is officially the Charvaklibtech_463_footnoteschool, I do not know that it has any votaries. I deny that
 
 Buddhists and Jains are atheists or agnostics. The latter they cannot be. Those who believe in the soul as apart from and capable of life independent of and after the dissolution of the body cannot be called atheists. We may all have different definitions or “God”. If we could all give our own definitions of God there would be as many defini- tions as there are men and women. But behind all that variety of definitions there would be also a certain sameness which would be unmistakable. For the root is one. God is that indefinable something which we all feel but which we do not know. Charles Bradlaugh described himself as an atheist no doubt but many  a  Christian  declined to regard him as such. He recognized in Bradlaugh a greater kinship with himself than many a lip Christian. I had the privilege of attending the funeral of that good friend of India. I noticed several clergymen at the function. There were certainly several Mussalmans and many Hindus in the procession. They all believed in God. Bradlaugh’s denial of God was a denial of Him as He was known to Bradlaugh to have been described. His was an eloquent and indignant protest against the then current theology and the terrible contrast between precept and practice. To me God is truth and love; God is ethics and morality; God is fearlessness. God is the source of Light and Life and yet He is above and beyond all these. God is conscience. He is even the atheism of the atheist. For in His boundless love God permits the atheist to live. He is the searcher of hearts. He transcends speech and reason. He knows us and our hearts better than we do ourselves. He does not take us at our word for He knows that we often do not mean it, some knowingly and others unknowingly. He is a personal God to those who need His personal presence. He is embodied to those who need His touch. He is the purest essence. He simply Is to those who have faith. He is all things to all men. He is in us and yet above and beyond us. One may banish the word “God” from the Congress but one has no power to banish the Thing Itself. What is a solemn affirmation if it is not the same thing as in the name of God. And surely conscience is but a poor and laborious paraphrase of the simple combination of three letters called God. He cannot cease to be because hideous immoralities or inhuman brutalities are comm- itted in His name. He is long suffering. He is patient but He is also terrible. He is the most exacting personage in the world and the world to come. He metes out the same measure to us that we mete out to our neighbours—men and brutes. With Him ignorance is no excuse. And withal He is ever forgiving for He always gives us the chance to
 repent. He is the greatest democrat the world knows, for He leaves us “unfettered” to make our own choice between evil and good. He is the greatest tyrant ever known, for He often dashes the cup from our lips and, under cover of free will, leaves us a margin so wholly inadequate as to provide only mirth for Himself at our expense. Therefore, it is that Hinduism calls it all His sport—lila, or calls it all an illusion—maya. We are not , He along Is. And if we will be, we must eternally sing His praise and do His will. Let us dance to the tune of His bansi—lute, and all would be well.libtech_464_footnote
 Since reference has been made to a bookletlibtech_465_footnotelibtech_466_footnoteof mine on ethics and religion, I must draw the attention of the reader to the fact that what the correspondent refers to is a translation of the original which is in Gujarati. But the Gujarati itself as the preface makes it clear is not an original effort but an adaptation from an American publication called Ethical Religion by Mr. Salter. The translation came under my notice in Yeravda Jail and I regretted to notice the absence of any mention of the source from which I had borrowed. The translator himself I understand did not rely upon the original Gujarati but a Hindi translation. The English rendering therefore is a round-about thing. I owe this explanation to the author of the original book and I am glad that the mention of the work by my correspondent has reminded me of my obligation.

  MY CRIME 
 I gladly print the following from Maulana Zafar Ali Khan written by him in his capacity as President of the Punjab Khilafat Committee:
 I have read with feelings of mingled amazement and pain your pronouncement, in Young India of the 26th instant, on stoning inci- dents in Kabul. You say that “this particular form of penalty cannotbe defended on the mere ground of its mention in the Koran”.libtech_467_footnoteYou, moreover, declare that “every formula of every religion has in this age of reason to submit to the acid test of reason and universal justice if it is to ask for universal assent”. Finally you maintain that error can claim no exemption even if it can be supported by the
 
 scriptures of the world.
 I have always paid unstinted homage to your greatness and have all along looked upon you as one of the few men who are making modern history; but I would be failing in my duty as a Mussalman if I refrained from pointing out to you that by challenging the right of the Koran to regulate the life of its followers in its own way you have shaken the belief of millions of your Muslim admirers in your capacity to lead them.
 You are at perfect liberty to express your opinion one way or the other as to whether renegades can be stoned to death under the law of Islam. But to hold that even if the Koran supported such form of penalty, it should be condemned outright as an error, is a form of reasoning which cannot appeal to the Mussalmans.
 Error is after all a relative term and Mussalmans have their own way of interpreting it. To them the koran is an unalterable law which transcends the ever changing policies and expendiencies of puny humanity. Would to God that to your multifarious activities as leader of India you had not added the rather delicate task of adversely criticizing the teaching of the Holy Koran.
The Maulana has put an interpretation upon my note which it
 does not bear. I have not adversely (or otherwise) criticized the teachings of the Holy Koran. But I have criticised the teachers, that is, the interpreters, in anticipation of their defending the penalty of stoning to death. I claim to understand enough of the Koran and the history of Islam to know that a multitude of interpreters have interpreted the Koran to suit their preconceived notions. My purpose was to issue a warning against the acceptance of such interpretations. But I would like to say that even the teachings themselves of the Koran cannot be exempt from criticism . Every true scripture only gains by criticism. After all we have no other guide but our reason to tell us what may be regarded as revealed and what may not be. The early Mussalmans accepted Islam not because they knew it to be revealed but because it appealed to their virgin reason. I fully endorse the Maulana’s statement that error is a relative term. But we know as a matter of fact that some things are universally accepted as errors. Death by torture is, I expect, such an error. In making the three statements the Maulana has quoted, I have simply mentioned three canons of interpretations which I think are incapable of challenge. Anyway, I abide by them . And if I am at perfect liberty to express my opinion “as to whether renegades can be stoned to death under the law of Islam” why may I not express an opinion as to whether
 penalty of stoning to death can be imposed at all under the law of Islam? The Maulana has betrayed intolerance of criticism by a non Muslim of anything relating to Islam. I suggest to him that intolerance of criticism even of what one may prize as dear as life itself is not conducive to the growth of public corporate life. Surely Islam has nothing to fear from criticism even if it be unreasonable. I therefore suggest to the Maulana the advisability in the light of my criticism of applying himself to an elucidation of the tremendous issues involved in the incidents reported from Kabul.

  NOTES–II 
 AN OASIS IN THE DESERT
 In the midst of complaints against Bombay in the matter of Khaddar,one is glad to find that a group of ladies are doing silent and effective work in spreading khaddar. A letter before me says:
 This month we are selling over Rs. 2,000 worth of khaddar vests for the work guild and schools. Moreover we have sent some to Bhavnagar. Add to this the usual money sales. A new class is being opened in the Seva Sadanlibtech_468_footnoteon the condition that only those children are to be admitted to it who are prepared to do a certain amount of spinning every day. When they have mastered the art, they are to contribute 2,000 yards per month. This is impressing the existing classes. The girls are to commence hand-spinning in some of them.
 Another friend properly remarks that it is not the people that are apathetic. It is the workers, the leaders. They are doing nothing to spread the gospel. The people have not yet developed that liking for khaddar as to make them go out of their way to procure khaddar, but if it is brought to their doors, they would gladly take it. The harvest is indeed such but the labourers are few. Why will not every worker make it a point to sell a given quantity of khaddar per month? I know that we have made sufficient progress in the manufacture of khaddar to be able to supply the most fastidious tastes. I was shown the other day a rich bride’s trousers. It was all made of khaddar and silver and gold embroidery. There was nothing wanting from a rich man’s point of view. And the khaddar saris were as fine as one could possibly desire. There was the inevitable richly-coloured shawl too made of
 
 khaddar which the bride has to wear on her being given to the bridegroom. Let no one therefore pretend that he or she does not use khaddar because it is not fine enough or coloured according to one’s tastes. Will the workers all over India please note and  copy  the example of the silent sisters whose efforts I have brought to their notice?
 FARIDPUR CONFERENCE
 I have telegrams from Faridpur urging me to attend the Bengal Provincial Conference. I am extremely sorry for my inability to attend it, much as I would love to do so. I had warnedlibtech_469_footnotethe Faridpur friends not to rely upon my attendance. I had told them that my movements were uncertain. Mine is not an enviable position. I have calls from Bihar, Wardha, Orissa, Andhra and several other places. I would like to visit all of them. But since I cannot visit all at the same time, I must judge where I can be of the greatest service at a particular moment. I feel that my place just now is among the valiant band of satyagrahis at Vykom. It is a promise long overdue. They are endeavouring to enforce the doctrine of satyagraha in every minute detail. They are few in number. They are fighting against heavy odds. Till now I have interfered with their seeking monetary and other help from outside. It is due to them that I should as a professing expert go to them and guide them and hearten them for all that lies in front of them. The friends from the other provinces will not grudge me or them this privilege of long-deferred communion.
 What is more, whereas I fancy I can be of some assistance to these satyagrahis, I feel sure that I can be of no use in the other provinces except to be on show there. My prescription for them is incredibly simple. Settle your local differences whether they are between Hindus and Mussalmans or other or whether they are between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. Spin as much as you can, wear khaddar on all occasions, enrol as many selfspinning members as you can for the Congress. And add to these those who will not spin themselves but will gladly furnish 2,000 yards of yarn per month, hand-spun for them by others. Help the suppressed classes in your district  or province in every way you can, rid your place of the drink and the opium evil, and then invite me for further effort. If we want an era of hope drawning upon us next year, during this year of grace we shall
 
 devote all our energy to the national constructive programme undeterred by anything that the Government may or may not do , the Bengal Ordinance notwithstanding. If we want to see the Ordinance removed, we must generate enough strength for the purpose. The only way I know of so doing is to work the constructive programme with all our might.
 A CASE FOR RECONSIDERATION
 Mr. A. V. Thakkar, that friend of the suppressed classes, has sent me a copy of the Report of the Committee appointed by the Bombay Corporation to inquire into the ejection from municipal chawls of certain members belonging to the suppressed classes. These poor men and women have been driven out on the grounds that they are not in municipal service, that some of them can afford to pay more and that some others are undesirable persons against whom prosecutions have been proved. On behalf of the evicted people it has been contended that they are near relatives of the employees, that they have been living in municipal chawls for years and that the evictions have been brought about at the instance of corrupt municipal servants who could not get bribes from the evicted persons. In the Municipal Commissioner’s report it is stated that
 some years ago after visiting the chawls and making enquiries I was satisfied that the evidence and statements made (about corruption) were such that no impartial person could accept them.
I cannot recall any such statement having been made by me. But
 the question of bribery is irrelevant. Even if every Municipal official would be proved to be above corruption, the eviction of the people other than employees is bad in principle so far as the suppressed classes are concerned. Theirs is a special case. They have nowhere to go to. They do not cluster together in municipal chawls for the sake of finding cheap habitation. They live there because they can procure no other for love or money. I hold that it is the duty of the Corporation not only to let the relatives of the suppressed class employees remain with them but it is also to provide enough and decent additional accommodation for these classes. The Corporation will be entitled to charge a reasonable rent for such accommodation. I know instances of very respectable members belonging to the suppressed classes having been unable to procure lodgings at any rent whatsoever. The owners will not  let  their  houses  to  these  classes. The objection of the Committee or the Municipal Commissioner to
 persons other than employees occupying municipal chawls would be valid, if it were raised in connection with any other class. I hope therefore that the case will be reopened and provision made for every one of the evicted men and women of the suppressed class.

  INTERVIEW TO PRESS ON HINDU-MUSLIM PROBLEM 
 BOMBAY,
 March 5, 1925
 My views remain the same as hitherto. Unity is inevitable. It will take longer than I had expected. The estrangement is undoubtedly growing. Let us hope that even in the midst of the storm, same of us will remain calm I am out for conquest. I as a Hindu will not therefore quarrel with the Mussalmans, neither will I yield to threats, such as I see are reported to have been uttered at Peshawar. I am in correspon- dencelibtech_474_footnoteboth with Maulana Zafar Ali Khan and Dr. Kitchlewlibtech_475_footnote.  I  hope that they are incorrectly reported. But I must refuse to lose my head even if they have said all that has been reported of them.I do not believe in the efficacy of retaliation. I would urge the Hindus not to be angry over such incidents. But I see that there is no settlement to be had in the near future. No lasting settlement can be had by higgling. I cannot be interested in a fight for sharing power with the bureaucracy. Such fight can only strengthen British dominance. I would prefer anarchy to that dominance. As equals I would value co-operation of the British, but I would prefer anarchy to their dominance. For I know that we can never become one nation through that dominance. I can see the chance of reconciliation between Hindu and Mussalmans after
 
 
 a free and hearty fight, but I see none with British arms restraining us. We must learn to restrain ourselves. My motto, therefore, is “Unite now, today, if you can; fight if you must. But in every case avoid British intervention”. I know that the temptation is great. But, great or small, I must avoid it at all cost. I can see swaraj rising out of the Thermopylae being enacted in every street or village in India, but I can see no swaraj out of the armed neutrality between the two communities. There is as much need for a change of heart among the Hindus and Mussalmans, as there is among the British, before a proper settlement is arrived at.
 “But who will follow your advice ?” asked the interviewer. The Mahatma replied:
I will. Is it not enough ? Must I surrender my belief because no
one will follow it ?
 “Still, that is no answer to my question,” said the interviewer. The Mahatma answered:
Your complaint is just. I cannot however take you any further. I
 know that I am at a discount just now. People will rush to the Govern- ment and in such circumstances if I were the Government, probably I would do exactly as the British are doing, i.e., try to divide both and rule. What can one do with those who want to be ruled? The Hindu- Muslim problem is therefore just now an insoluble puzzle. I propose to keep out of it, holding myself available whenever wanted. I believe in God, not as a theory but a fact, more real than that of life itself. I must therefore wait upon Him. In the hour of my need He will guide my steps on this question as He has done hitherto. Meanwhile, in the spinning-wheel and untouchability, I have more than enough to  occupy my time and that of those who think like me.
 “ But will you not make some concrete suggestion for those who will (not ?) follow your advice ?” was the last question.
I must think about them. I do not want to add to the
 complications by adding a new formula to the many that are current among us, unless I see a chance of its proper working.

DEAR JANAKDHARI BABUlibtech_476_footnote,
 Your letter has been travelling with me all this time. I am now writing this in the train that is taking me to Madras. I had no intention of being inattentive to anybody at Belgaum. But what was I to do ? I had not a moment for personal chats. I therefore hardened my heart.
 You are morose. There is no occasion for it. Let us do the day’s work to the best of our ability and smile. All work faithfully done has the same value in the book of life. Why then should we worry?
 You have not asked any definite questions. But if you have any, pray do not hesitate to ask them. Be assured that you are the same to me that you were before. I treasure the memory of the faithful co- workers of Champaran. I shall never have and never had a more faithful band to work with. If I had such a band throughout India, swaraj will not be long in coming to India.

   INTERVIEW TO “SWADESAMITRAN”libtech_479_footnote      MADRAS, 
  March 7, 1925 Our representative had an interview with Mahatmaji at about 1.30 p.m. at the residence of 	Shri Srinivasa Iyenger.	When 	our representative 	arrived there, a few    
 college girls were already there to have the darshanlibtech_480_footnoteof Mahatmaji.
 Mahatmaji asked the girls:
Do you spin on the charkha?
 One of the girls replied that as they were at college, they could not find time for spinning . Mahatmaji asked them a few questions about their college, curricula, etc, and asked,
“Do you like Tamil language more, or English?”
 One of them replied that they have more liking for Tamil which was their mother tongue. At the end, when the girls took leave of Gandhiji, he advised them to take to spinning on charkha. The girls promised to do so.
 Thereafter, our representative had the following conversation with Gandhiji:
 QUESTION: When I read in papers about what you told a Press correspondent at Bombay regarding the problem of Hindu-Muslim unity, I felt that the atmosphere was such as to cause difference. I would therefore like to know from you directly your assessment of the present situation.
 There is an increasing lack of unity between the two fraternal groups. Mutual suspicion has grown.
 What would be your immediate solution to this problem?
 Mutual mistrust should be given up to strengthen the bonds of unity; the people should repose faith in their leaders.
 In connection with the Viceroy’s visit to England, the British Press have started a propaganda campaign against India and against Indian interests and advancement. In this context, a few persons have suggested that we should also do counter-propaganda in England for making the truth known and for explaining the viewpoints of the Indian people. I would like to know your opinion in the matter.
 It is impossible for us to do propaganda through the British Press. The British Press is bent upon furthering Imperial aims. However much we give them facts about the actual position in India, they would not publish them. At one time, factual material for publication as an advertisement was sent to a British paper by a person along with the charges for publication. But the paper returned the money saying that it could not publish it.
 Can’t we propagate our views among the general public in England?
 The British people are not such as to believe only the views expressed by our speakers. The Englishmen by nature are made to
 
 realize the bad situtation in a country only by two indications, that is, by the eruption of revolution or the launching of the mass movement of non-co-operation with government in that country. Once upon a time when Babu Surendra Nath Banerjealibtech_481_footnotewent to England and ably represented the degenerated state of affairs in India, it is said that an English gentlemen posed this question: “If what you say is true, why havn’t your countrymen risen in revolt?” The same mentality still persists.
 It is said that the majority report of the Reforms Enquiry Committeelibtech_482_footnoteis retrograde. Is it not necessary to start a country-wide agitation against Government accepting the findings of the committee?
As far as I am concerned, I try my level best to read the minds
 of the common people whether it be the retrograde findings of the Muddiman Committee, Government’s repressive measures, or its frightful governance, I do not think that any of these factors would be able to arouse feelings among our countrymen at present. To the extent I can, I only see a sense of despair overwhelming the people all over our country.
 What then is your suggestion to rid the people of their despair and infuse spirit in them?
There is no better device to inculcate the right spirit in the
 people than the universal adoption of hand-spinning on charkha. The primary demand of the masses, the poor, is food. It is charkha alone that is capable of giving food to all of them, like a grand benefactor.
 You might have come across the recent speeches made by General Smuts. Is it advisable for South Africans Indian to join hands with him and his partymen in the agitation for securing the rights mentioned in his speeches?
If General Smuts really intends to put in practice  all  that  he
uttered in his [recent] speeches, it is enough if united efforts are made
 
 to achieve the rights enumerated by him. At present he is in the opposition. Indians [in South Africa] may join him in his efforts to secure the said rights. But one has to be cautious as the possibility of his going back on his words when he is back in power should also be borne in mind.
 Gandhiji said it was not possible for him to say then how long he would stop at Vykom, and that he would inform all concerned prior to his return to Madras.

   INTERVIEW TO FREE PRESS OF INDIA      MADRAS, 
  March 	7, 1925  A 	representative of the Free 	Press of India interviewed 	the Mahatma 	in regard 	 to Lord 	Reading’s visit to England.  Do 	you anticipate any change in Britain’s Indian policy consequent on 	Birkenheadlibtech_483_footnoteReading 	consultations?  	What a big question this for a simple man believing in the 	spinning-wheel?  Supposing 	Government takes to a policy of repression in the near future, what 	will be your message to the country? I 	will say: “Khaddar, khaddar, khaddar”. That is one thing I emphasize. Remember 	the removal of untouchability too.  Do 	you believe that khaddar only is sufficient answer for repression. Yes, 	that is so. It is an effective one.  The 	Bombay Chronicle, 9-3-1925                    
  INTERVIEW TO “SWARAJYA” 
 MADRAS,
 March 7, 1925
 Questioned by the Swarajya representative whether the acceptance of office by the Swarajists would in any way affect the relations between the Congress and the Swaraj Party, Mahatmaji answered with a decisive “No” and added that the Congress had given a carte blanche to the Swarajists in regard to their activities in the Councils.
 On his attention being drawn to the Viceroy’s assent to the Hindu Religious Endowments Act in spite of opposition from the elected Hindu members, Mahatmaji stated that he had not studied that Act or its implications, and added that in case it became absolutely necessary for him to do so he would pay his attention to it and express his opinion in course of time.
 Questioned whether it was consistent with the policy of the Congress for the President of the Tamilnad Congress Committee to openly support the Act, Mahatmaji replied that he saw no objection to any Congressman supporting the Act who also accepted the principle of entry into the Councils.
 To another question Mahatmaji replied that he would certainly avail himself of the opportunity of his visit to Vykom to see the Maharani Regent if he could.
 He also confessed with regret that the prospects of Hindu-Muslim unity in the North which he lately visited were not very bright. He said that on his way to Bombay he had written on the subject to Dr. Kitchlew and other Muslim leaders and he was expecting a reply from them. Mahatmaji expressed his satisfaction at the cordial relationship existing between the two communities in this province.
 The only message he could give to the South was.
I ask them to spin, that’s all.

 220 SPEECH IN REPLY TO CORPORATION ADDRESS, MADRAlibtech_484_footnote
     MR. PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF THE CORPORATION, AND FRIENDS,  March 	7, 1925 
  	As usual, I hope you will excuse me for my inability to speak to you 	standing. I thank you very sincerely for the beautiful address that    
 you have been pleased to present to me. It is always a matter of embarrassment for me to receive addresses. On several occasions I have described myself as a scavenger, and I should be content if I could die also as a scavenger. I am a lover of municipal work. Fates have decided otherwise There was a time when I was myself thinking seriously of taking to municipal life. It is a life in which a great deal of plodding is required. I am myself a plodder, and I call myself a scavenger because I believe in sanitation from more than one point of view, that is to say, in outward sanitation, as also inward sanitation.
 I am not a stranger to Madras. I have lived off and on several occasions in Madras, sufficiently long to enable me to study and understand the sanitation of your city; and it has always grieved me whenever I have walked through your streets early in the morning to see them disfigured. I used to talk when I used to live with Mr. Natesanlibtech_485_footnotelibtech_486_footnoteabout the conditions of the streets of Madras. I do not wish to single out the streets of Madras as if they are more insanitary than the streets of other cities of India. But I cannot help remarking upon the condition of your streets because I think that more than any other city of India, the streets of Madras were at that time disfigured even by grown-up elderly men. It was a sight to which I must confess I was unused before I came to Madras, and often did I feel like taking a broom myself and cleaning up every nook and corner of the streets through which I passed. I still indulge in it as a pastime. Whenever I can get a little bit of cleaning work, I assure you, it gives me a pleasure and you could understand my weakness also from municipal addresses. If I must receive addresses at all, I always feel that the receipt of the municipal address does give me opportunity to drive this one truth home to the citizens of India. I feel that in the matter of outward sanitation we have to learn a great deal from the West. It has been my painful duty often to speak against the Western civilization and the methods of the West. I, therefore, whenever I get  an opportunity, never miss the opportunity of saying what we can legitimately and usefully learn from the West; and I think that for the methods of sanitation in the large cities that we have in India we cannot do better than go to the West for the lessons. I wish I could drive the truth home to you that scavenging is an occupation which is a noble occupation although it may not give as much renown and that notoriety which services in other departments of life bring to us. You
 
 
 will not misunderstand me when I make this comparison in favour of municipal service. Service in other walks of life is just as important as municipal service, but I have noticed a tendency in our public life to disregard the value of municipal service.
 You have said several things in your address in praise of such humble services which I have been able to render in my capacity as a humanitarian. I am humanitarian first, and I want to remain a humanitarian up to the very last. I notice, however, one singular omission from your address, and that is in connection with khaddar. I would like to point out to you that among my humble services in the cause of humanity I place khaddar almost in the forefront. Unity among the different races and the different communities belonging to different religions of India is indispensable to the birth of national life. Remove the curse of untouchability, which is as necessary as the removal of phthisis to an individual. It is eating into the vitals of Hinduism, but the removal of the degrading poverty of the masses is dependent upon khaddar and it is for that reason that I say to every Indian, to every Englishman in India, every foreigner who comes to India to visit me when they ask me what is it that I would desire for a foreigner to do. I tell him: “Study the conditions of my country and find out whether you have anything better than simple  spinning- wheel, and if you find, after a careful study of the conditions of India, that there is nothing better, speak a word on behalf of the spinning- wheel.” I wish that I could isolate the spinning-wheel from several other things, from the politics of the country. But you are aware I have said on more than one occasion that all these departments of life are interwoven and intermixed, that it is impossible to isolate them from the other departments of life. But I do know that, apart from the political value of the spinning-wheel, and to produce khaddar, if we are to remove the economic distress under which this  land  is labouring, if we are to serve the dumb millions of India, we cannot do without khaddar, we cannot do without the spinning-wheel. I therefore humbly commend it to the attention of the Municipal Councillors. I ask you to give it a place in your schools and I ask you whether you are Englishmen or Indians, whether you are Mussalmans or Hindus, whether you belong to one political school or other in the country, to give place to the spinning-wheel and khaddar in your homes.
 I assure you after a little bit of experience of spinning-wheel and khaddar that what I have said is the truth and nothing but the
 truth. I thank you very much again for presenting me with this address. I wish the Municipal Corporation of Madras a successful career and in the competition for shining in the matters of municipal life the first place. I thank you once again.

221. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, MADRASlibtech_487_footnote
 March 7, 1925
MR. CHAIRMAN AND FRIENDS,
 I thank you all and the various associations sincerely for the addresses that have been presented to me this afternoon. It is a matter for great pity that even after so many years it is not possible for you to understand Hindustani or Hindi and it is a matter of shame and sorrow for me that I am unable to speak to you either in Tamil or in Telugu. I was looking forward to the pleasure of being able to address the audiences in the southern Presidency in Tamil if I had  been allowed to finish my six years in Yeravda. Unfortunately for me and unfortunately for you it was not to be. But I do hope that a time will come, and that soon, when you will insist upon people coming from the north and the western Presidency addressing you in Hindustani. You know, and if you have not, you ought to know, that over Rs. 75,000 have been brought from the other parts of India and spent in the southern Presidency in order to induce it to pick up Hindustani. There are teachers covering this Presidency who are giving lessons in Hindi or Hindustani. After all you should take the trouble of learning them. If you have not yet availed yourselves of the opportunity afforded to you let me hope that you will do so now.
 It is but a stage in my journey that I find myself today in Madras. I have come not to pay a visit to Madras but to visit the satyagrahis at Vykom and if, after I have finished my work there, time is left for me I do intend to pass a few days in Madras and renew my acquaintance with you individually. (“Hear, hear!”) Meanwhile, I ask you to respond to the request made from the chair that you should pray for the success of the mission that awaits me in Vykom. I am going to Vykom personally to tender my sympathy and support to the devoted band of satyagrahis. I hope that they will allow me to wait
 
 
 upon the orthodox party and try to find out their viewpoint. Satyagraha not being a war of violence but being a war of conversion and of conviction, no opportunity will be lost be me in trying to understand the view point of the orthodox party and placing my own before them. If she will graciously permit me I hope also to wait upon Her Highness the Maharani as also upon the Diwan and the other officials concerned.
 For me the question of untouchability is a deeply religious question. It is a matter of penance and purification on the part of those who are not untouchables. It is a matter of essential reform in Hinduism. If you will therefore out of deepest conviction pray for success to my mission I want all these prayers of yours.
 I know that having come here you will expect me to say something on the present situation that faces India, but you will not expect me to speak upon what may be termed the political side of the question. I am uninterested in it. Whilst it is an integral part of the Congress organization, I have purposely refrained from interesting myself in it.
 I have no aptitude for it, nor faith in it. But that does not by any means mean that others need not or should not have faith in that programme. My life’s work is chalked out for me. I know for certain that if we can ensure reform from within, the other will follow as day follows night. I am equally certain that no reform from without can avail without reform from within. Every effort that might be made in the Legislative Councils or in the Legislative Assembly, every effort that might be made on your behalf in London, will be perfectly fruitless. this is not said by way of criticism of those who are taking part in that activity, but this is said in order to emphasize the fact that you and I, the men in the street, have to look after ourselves. This is said in order to emphasize the fact that if you and I are to help the fruition of that programme, we must work from within. What can your Councils do if Hindus and Mussalmans fly at one another’s throats? What can the Councillors do on the Council floor if we, the Hindus, ostracize a fifth of our own kith and kin? What can they do if we will not identify ourselves with the down-trodden, poverty-stricken masses of India by turning the wheel and wearing khaddar? I am told times without number, in season and out of season, that nothing can be done in this great country of ours unless there is some excitement provided for the people. But please remember that swaraj is not a product of excitement or intoxication. Swaraj will be the natural and inevitable
 result of business-like habits. It will be a natural and inevitable result of co-operation among our own ranks, of exacting discipline and obedience, and of sustained energy and willing, well-meant, calculated sacrifice. It will be natural and inevitable result of co-operative industry on the part of the whole nation. It will be the natural and inevitable result of an enlightened awakening amongst the masses of India. But half-a dozen or twenty cities of India along  working together cannot bring swaraj. We who have attained a degree of political consciousness and have begun to love our country for the sake of it, must spread ourselves out amongst the masses and go back to the villages.
 Of Hindu-Muslim unity you know what I have said in Bombay. Those of you who know how to spin will understand the simile I am about to give you. Indifferent spinners amongst you know how sometimes when you are unwinding your yarn from the spindle it becomes sometimes a tangle. You know the more you try to undo the tangle the more knotty it becomes, and a wise spinner leaves his tangle aside for the moment when he has lost his temper and approaches it after he has cooled down. So it is with the Hindu-Muslim question. It has become a hopeless tangle at the present moment. I thought I was an expert in solving that tangle as I think I am also an expert in spinning. But for the time being I have put away in my cupboard this Hindu-Muslim tangle. That does not mean that I have despaired of a solution. My mind will eternally work at it till I find out a solution. But I must confess to you today that I cannot present a workable solution that you will accept. In the atmosphere surcharged as it is with mutual distrust I cannot persuade either the Hindus or the Mussalmans to accept my solution. But for you I would like to leave this little single thought that those of you who have to deal with Hindus or Mussalmans as the case may be, be straightforward, honest and fearless in your dealings with one another. In spite of the horizon which is black before you, do not lose faith, be loving to one another, remembering that the same Divine Spirit inhabits whether it is the Hindu body or Muslim body and try to be charitable, one towards the other.
 Of untouchability you know the exact position wihtout my having to say a word. But I am aware, probably you will also agree, that we have, during the last four years, made a tremendous advance in the right direction. It is not enough, I know, for the purpose required; but it is enough to fill us with the hope that within the present
 generation the curse will be blotted out of Hinduism.
 Last but not the least to mention remain the spinning-wheel and khaddar. I know that even in that direction we have done something. But it is sheer laziness and our ignorance that have left khaddar in the position in which it stands today. There is no question here of passion and prejudice as there is about the Hindu-Muslim problem. There is no question of religious intolerance as there is about untouchability. I have not yet met a single man who has told me that it is against his conscience either to turn the spinning-wheel or to wear khaddar, its product. It is the simplest A B C of economics that millions of the masses of India who have at least four months of idleness on their hands would be able to turn those four months to good use if they had the spinning-wheels in their cottages. Whilst a few pies per day may be nothing to you and to me, those few pies are a heavensent gift to these masses. It must be a matter of ordinary common sense to understand that if we would have our masses to spin the charkha we must first of all learn the art that has all but died out before we would take the message of hope to these cottages. You will agree that it will be easy enough for a child to understand that if the masses are to spin the charkha and weave khaddar, the classes and masses together must use and wear khaddar, and I am sorry to have to prophesy that if we have become so soft as not to be able to wear coarse khaddar, remember that there is no swaraj for us in this generation. Swaraj is a hardy tree of patient growth and therefore it requires the patient toil of hardy men and women and you will have to do what Elizabeth of old did for her own country. She prohibited the import of soft cloth from Holland and herself wore and coarse cloth that was woven for her in her own dear England and imposed that obligation upon the whole of that nation. You need not go into the complications about the question of khaddar and the spinning-wheel. You need not bother your heads about the question whether it cannot by itself bring swaraj. Let it be a simple but easy test for you and for me. Are we or are we not ready to give half an hour to the nation and spin away for all we are worth for the sake of the nation, for the sake of identifying ourselves with the poorest in the land? Are we or are we not ready to wear such cloth as may be spun and woven by our sisters and  brothers? What is better, that we send away one anna or two annas per yard of calico to Manchester or Ahmedabad or send one anna or two annas to the cottages near Madras? Which is your choice? Have you or have you not enough patriotism in yourselves to think of your near
 
 neighbours who are starving?
 I am patient by nature. But patient as I am, I grow impatient when clever people talk to me all kinds of sophistries, when it is easy enough for them to understand that one yard of khaddar bought by them means at least two annas in the pockets of the poorest. I have no other and better message for our land and if I am the only one living, a solitary witness of the message, I must continue to deliver that message so long as I have life in me.
 You want civil disobedience. I want it also. I know it is the only substitute for an armed revolt. It is the real test of our strength. But disobedience to be civil implies discipline, thought, care, attention. Civil disobedience and excitement and intoxication go ill together. And I know that without proper careful organization of the spinning- wheel and khaddar, there is absolutely no civil disobedience. As Lalaji well said, we may gain swaraj but we shall not have the power to retain it. He said that on another occasion, speaking on another subject; but that remark applies with equal, if not greater force, in connection with civil disobedience.
 I thank you for having listened to my remarks with such great patience and courtesy. Let me hope that you will be courteous enough to translate my message into action, if it has carried conviction to you. May God give you the strength and the wisdom necessary for the purpose.
 In conclusion, he asked the audience to remain quite at their seats and let him slip out of the meeting without any disturbance whatsoever.

222. REMINISCENCES OF KATHIAWAR–II
 OTHER STATES
 I found that the Rulers of Porbunder, Wankaner and Wadhwan enjoyed the same popularity which I had noticed in the case of His Highness the Thakore Saheb. Each of them seemed to desire the good of the people. I was left with the impression that every one of them was trying to satisfy his subjects. However, I must say one thing. I found that in each State the Ruler’s expenses exceeded his income, more or less. I am certain that a Ruler cannot justify his guardianship so long as he does not cut down his expenses. He takes a share of his subjects, earnings and offers his own services in return. One whose services are indispensable becomes the leader. He remains a true
 leader only so long as he is loyal. A Ruler’s loyalty should mean two things.On the one hand, he must protect the welfare, freedom and virtue of his subjects and, on the other hand, he must put to good use the revenues collected from them. If the Ruler spends money on himself in an unbecoming manner, he is not utilizing the revenues properly. He may certainly spend a little more than his subjects, he may indulge in luxuries if he so wishes; there must, however, be a limit to this. As one disinterested, I can clearly see that, in this age of public awakening, such a limit is entirely essential. No institution  which cannot prove its utility for the people will be able to survive long. Having observed, as much as I could in a week, four States in Kathiawar, I did find some justification for my defence of the form of Government existing there; along with this, however, its weaknesses also became apparent to me. As a well-wisher of the Rulers, I would humbly request them voluntarily to introduce the above changes, for, if they do so, not only will they gain more popularity but will enhance the prestige of their thrones. He who sets limits to his own authority, is the real Ruler. God has Himself set limits to His own power, and in spite of having the capacity of misuse that power, He does not do so. Anyone who, despite the capacity to subsist physically, renounces that capacity attains  mokshalibtech_488_footnotelibtech_489_footnote. The   perfect  brahmacharilibtech_490_footnotelibtech_491_footnote,  by  voluntarily conserving his energies, reaches such a state that finally he becomes, as it were, impotent. That state is beyond description. It is beyond all duality. Though he appears corporeal, he is pure and immutable  spirit. That is why the English maxim says: “The king can do no wrong.” The author of the Bhagavata says that the Radiant One can do no wrong. Tulsidas remarked in his sweet Hindi: “Oh holy man! The Mighty can have no faults.” In our age, all these three maxims are being misinterpreted; and it is believed and said that the powerful one even though he commits an offence cannot be guilty. The very opposite is true. He alone is strong who never misuses his strength and voluntarily renounces the misuse of his strength, so much so that he becomes incapable of such misuse. Why cannot our Rulers become so? Is it beyond their powers?
 NATIONAL SCHOOLS
 I witnessed the opening of two national schools. One was in Rajkot. His Highness the Thakore Saheb performed the opening
 
 ceremony at which I was present. The other was in Wadhwan. Here I myself performed the opening ceremony. Both had to face storms; both had to grapple with the problem of the  Antyajaslibtech_492_footnotelibtech_493_footnote.  Both  have solved that problem but are not completely out of danger. The strength of the teachers will be tested by their ability to avoid this danger. If the teachers carry on their work discreetly, peacefully, with circumspection and forbearance, they will not antagonize the people in spite of admitting Antyajas; and children of other castes will continue to attend the schools. The national character of the school consists in the strength of the teachers’ character, their patriotism, their readiness for sacrifice and their determination. I am envious in a good-humoured way of the buildings of both the  schools.  These would prove a boon if austere teachers dwell there, otherwise they may bring about our downfall. In Burma there was a time when in every town sadhus taught diligently in good schools housed in good buildings. The buildings today are the same. However, when I visited those schools I found sleepy, indolent sadhus there. The schools existed merely in name. They had lost their souls. Just as admission of Antyajas is an essential aspect of national schools, so is the spinning- wheel. On the regular turning of that wheel depends the turn of the wheel of India’s fortunes. The full development of the wheel is possible only through  national schools. I look forward to its deification in every school. The teachers’ service to the country will be measured by their ability to inculcate respect for it. The spinning- wheel is the only means for energizing this country which is slumbering in idleness. As the wheel calls for disinterested labour, it yields the greatest reward; and it is beautiful work. It may at first appear monotonous, however; there is music in that monotony. It is for the teachers to train the ear for this music. I hope that both these schools will become perfect models.
 TO CITIZENS OF WADHWAN
 I appeal to the citizens of Rajkot and Wadhwan to take interest in their schools. My appeal is especially directed to the citizens of the latter. There was some bitterness at Wadhwan between Acharya Fulchand and the citizens. I deliberately sought an occasion to understand this matter. I met those gentlemen who had some complaints. As a result of this, I came to the conclusion that there was no cause for complaint unless it be Shri Fulchand’s temper. The
 
 citizens have a prominent role under the new  arrangements. The school belongs to them. It is desirable that they take part in its activities with enthusiasm. It is their duty to take such part. They did so once and they also contributed funds. Everyone said that had Shri Shivlal been alive Wadhwan would have shone out uniquely. All men, however, are mortal. We may, if we choose, immortalize those whom we love. Why cannot many wise citizens of Wadhwan become Shivlals? It is not too much to hope that the wealthy citizens of the town will take it upon themselves to finance the school. While the teachers are the souls of such institutions, the citizens should become the bodies.
 TECHNICAL SCHOOL
 The technical school for spinning and weaving founded at Wadhwan by Shri Shivlal is also remarkable. A fair amount of propagation of khadi has been carried out by that school. However, I consider it insufficient in view of the potentialities of the villages around Wadhwan. On the principle that where nothing has been done all round, even a little effort shines out, Wadhwan may be deemed to have done well. However, we cannot rest satisfied with a little. The real question is whether Wadhwan has done all that it could. I have said already that its capacity is great. The technical school is a solid memorial to Shri Shivlal. The spinning-wheel was his life’s work. I was told that he had fully understood its significance. I hope that all aspects of the art of the spinning-wheel will be developed in Wadhwan.
 THREE SPRINGS
 Today, there are three springs of khadi in Kathiawar— Wadhwan, Madhada and Amreli. The organizing committee has drawn up plans to produce more khadi. However, it is desirable that these three centres should exchange their experience and enter into a  healthy competition with one another. All the three centres can multiply the production of khadi. There is every hope that khadi will get encouragement from the States. Hence these centres should not falter in producing khadi. Proper steps should be taken incessantly for the propagation of khadi amongst the people. The organizing committee is primarily responsible for this. I wish that this committee should buy up all the khadi that is left over and stock it. It should take over the monopoly of khadi. What is practised by the rich in America in order to increase their wealth should be practised by us for the
 good of the people. In order to gain control over a certain business, they buy up the entire stock of that article and then sell it at any price they choose. Why should we not do the same for khadi in the interest of the people? In America, such monopoly is practised in order to raise prices. We shall do so in order to bring down prices. The cost of producing khadi varies at different places because there is some variation in the cost of spinning, etc. Moreover, we are seeking gifts of cotton. This is in a way a bounty or encouragement for  khadi. Because of this, the committee can afford to sell khadi at a loss, whereas private organizations usually cannot do this. The former can add up the different charges, then add to it the cost of cotton received by way of gift, and then sell khadi at the price arrived at. The rate at which private organizations are to be paid can be fixed by talking the matter over with the organizations concerned. They should, however, bear the following in mind.
  They 	should locally dispose 	of as much as 	possible. For instance, 	some of 	the khadi 	produced in 	Wadhwan must 	find a local 	market. In other 	words, the organizations 	concerned must make efforts for 	local safe.  The 	organizations should 	improve the quality 	of yarn 	and attend 	to the 	count and fineness. The 	standard of 	weaving should be improved.  They 	should take 	only the cost 	price from 	the committee 	and satisfy 	the committee 	on this score. 
 This task can be achieved only when everyone works diligently, honestly and in mutual trust. We are faced with many difficulties because we have not developed either the enthusiasm or the ability to team together for public service. These organizations can keep away from all these shortcomings because their workers have a well- developed sense of public service. They are imbued with a missionary spirit and have had some experience too. They might not have learnt how to work harmoniously together and to tolerate different temperaments. Where the motives are good, experience alone will overcome the shortcomings.
 IMPROVE THE SPINNING - WHEEL
 Ordinarily I carry my spinning-wheel with me when I travel. However, because of my faith in Kathiawar and the reluctance to travel with excessive luggage, I did not take the spinning-wheel with me and decided to borrow one wherever I went. This gave me a good
 
 opportunity for testing [the progress of spinning]. I had hoped to get  a good spinning-wheel in Rajkot, at any rate. However, I would by no means call it good. A good spinning-wheel is one the tape, belt, etc., of which are of the best quality, and its spindle is neither thin nor bent. I do not think that it passed all these tests. However, what I found intolerable was the dust that had gathered on the spinning-wheel. A workman always keeps his tools in the best shape. Why should the wheel gather dust? In Jetpur the very limit was reached. Devchandbhai hastily promised that he had an excellent spinning-wheel which he would send immediately. He had taken me to Jetpur by car. It was eleven o’clock at night but how could I go to sleep without spinning? The spinning-wheel duly arrived, but why should it work at all? The spindle worked was if it was the guest of the Girnar mountain, the tape consisted of yarn wrapped anyhow, the belt, a mere string. Ordinarily, my arm does not ache when I work on the spinning-wheel but this time I had to turn the wheel so hard that within half an hour my arm was tired. Such was Devchandbhai’s fine spinning-wheel. After this bitter experience, it appeared as if Devchandbhai had called the public meeting in order to mock at the spinning-wheel. I did not spare the wheel nor its owner my rebuke at the meeting. However, in the light of the aforesaid misinterpretation of the maxim, namely, the powerful are blameless, who would put the blame on Devchandbhai’s spinning- wheel? After all, he was the secretary. He himself was convinced that his spinning-wheel could not possibly be faulty. I would, therefore, like to make it publicly known that if Devchandbhai does not immediately set right his spinning-wheel, he will be removed from office.
I  have had  enough  of  joking.  But  even  a  joke  has   a   sting.
 However, as the sting is merely that of conscience, it will be wel- comed even though it hurts. It is difficult to get a pure and upright secretary like Devchandbhai. We should make the best use of him that we could. Where the subjects slumber, the king cannot be awake. How could Devchandbhai be vigilant when all of us are negligent ? He has understood the significance of the spinning-wheel but he did  not repair or adorn it because of the slackness all around him. If he was devoted only to the spinning-wheel, the imperfection in his wheel would be unforgivable. I was a little less dissatisfied with Porbandar. The same could be said of Wankaner. This imperfection gave me an idea of the progress of the spinning-wheel in Kathiawar. The wheel has not yet secured the place of honour which it deserves. It is being
 tolerated but not welcomed; it is a stranger at the door and has not become an honoured guest. So long as it is not treated as an honoured guest Kathiawar will continue to starve.
 I have reason to write at length about imperfections in the spinning-wheel. It is easy to find fault with it. My suggestions are as follows:
 The 	secretaries should keep 	account of the spinning-wheels.  An 	expert or 	two should 	be appointed 	to go 	round and 	examine each spinning-wheel.  Owners 	should be invited 	to register 	complaints about their 	spinning-wheels.  The 	spindles, etc., 	of the 	wheels in 	use should 	be repaired. 	Large spindles may be replaced by rods with necessary modifications. The 	expert should explain 	all the changes 	to the owners.  In 	every town 	which he 	visits, he 	should train a 	local expert 	and maintain 	a list 	of these experts.  The 	expert should 	keep a 	record of 	the output 	of each 	spinning-wheel and 	the hours for 	which it 	is used. 
 If work is done systematically in this manner, a great improvement will be noticed within a short time in the spinning wheel and its yarn output. I found that whereas I can easily turn out a hundred yards of yarn on my spinning-wheel, on these other wheels I could hardly spin fifty. Moreover, except in Rajkot nowhere else did I experience the pleasure that one has while plying a good spinning- wheel. Before the end of this year, not only should khadi gain a firm foothold in Kathiawar, but we should acquire such skill as to be able to weave fine saris. I found that Yashodabehn had had hand-spun dhotis woven for her husband, Dahyabhai. These could compete with the fine dhotis made in Andhra. Why cannot hundreds of men and women spin such fine yarn?
 POLITICS
 The division of labour agreed to at the time of the conference was as follows—the people should spin, wear khadi, and I should take care of political matters. I have already explained its implications, yet it is necessary to explain them again. This is what it means. Just as the people must actively fulfil their own pledge, similarly I too must be alert and fulfil mine. The people can, by being vigilant, fulfil their pledge and succeed therein. This is because the key to success is in
 
 their own hands. It is possible that, in spite of my vigilance and in spite of fulfilling my pledge, I may not succeed, because my success depends on others. Moreover, my success too is dependent on the people’s fulfilment of their pledge. It is sad that it should still be necessary to explain how politics is linked with yarn. The collective strength of the people lies in spinning yarn. I am convinced that its invisible power will influence everything. Whether this is true or not, it is necessary that the people realize the implication of my pledge. There is no guarantee that I will indeed be able to achieve something. I have only pointed out to the people the path which I consider the best. A nation cannot achieve anything through demonstrations alone. We should also understand the situation of the Rulers. Our purpose is not served by mere condemnation or criticism. In order to understand this situation, I advised the conference to refrain from passing resolutions on political matters. I have pledged myself to examine the matter as thoroughly as possible in my capacity as the president. I am striving to fulfil the pledge. I am not reclining at ease, nor shall I do so. However, this does not mean that those who are suffering should seek no remedy. My advice merely means that the conference can assist in the above manner. It should be clearly understood that I am in no way opposed to people adopting whatever truthful and peaceful means they prefer to redress their grievances. The conference should give all possible assistance. At the moment, that assistance has taken the form of my using all my powers of persuasion with those States against which complaints have been made. Success depends on the purity of the issue and the persons concerned and on the people’s fulfilment of their own pledge. The people too must create an impression by their vigilant work. They will gain self-confidence if they preserve their self-respect by means of constructive work. Today, the people of Kathiawar, like those elsewhere, have lost their self- respect. My experience suggests that in many States of Kathiawar, the conditions are such that the people can make as much progress as they wish. Some facilities that are absent in British India are available to the people of the States of Kathiawar. The people can take full advantage of these only by engaging themselves in constructive work.
 FIRST OF APRIL
 I have taken such a fancy for Kathiawar that I have arranged to visit it again in April. I had to see the Antyaja school at Botad, the khadi centre at Amreli and the Ashram at Madhada. This, however,
 was not possible during my last visit. Those who wish to take me to different places should arrange my April programme in consultation with Devchandbhai and the Amreli office. I hope that no one will wish to take me to a single place where khadi is not the attraction. I expect to see a large number of members enrolled in April. I also hope that cotton which was promised has already been collected and more promises secured; and lastly, those centres which were to be opened under the Rajkot resolution have started working.

   MY NOTES  
 A SISTER’S SENTIMENTS
Bhai Vitthaldas Jerajani writes:libtech_494_footnote
 This feeling is understandable. Anyone who has worn khadi spun by himself and woven by himself or others can realize the value of the pearl-like tears which have fallen from this sister’s eyes. A certain gentleman had lost a towel made of self-spun yarn. He was restless with anxiety so long as it was not traced. We attach no value to   a match-stick or a pin but what would be our attitude if we had made it ourselves? The same sweetness and sentiment that one sees in food cooked by oneself one also finds in hand-spun, hand-woven khadi.
 AMONG “KALIPARAJ”
 The following is an extract from a letter I have received from the Vedchhi Khadi Ashram:libtech_495_footnote
 The experience of this correspondent is shared by others in many places. The spinning-wheel has become the focal point for nation-building.
 WHAT IS REQUIRED IN EDUCATION
An educationist writes as follows:libtech_496_footnote
The reader will see that these ideas are contrary to those of Dr.
 
 Sumant Mehta. There is truth in both these view-points. It would be good if both were put into practice. However, we do not always have the strength to do everything that is good. Experience alone will determine the ultimate shape of education. It is not our indifference to chemistry and other such subjects but rather lack of equipment which is responsible for our not teaching them at the moment. It is for this very reason that only the most important things have been accommodated. The spinning-wheel is the symbol of industry. When it is firmly established in its proper place, the sciences and crafts of the blacksmith, the carpenter and others will automatically find a place. There is no doubt that our efforts should be to meet the needs of all the four castes. I can see that we are making progress in that direction. If all educationists who put their faith in national education continue the work assigned to them with faith and courage, the desired changes will come about of their own accord. Where the intention is honest, success is inevitable. I observed during my tour that people are prepared, or almost anxious, to contribute funds for these activities, but we have a dearth of men with conviction and competence.

      SPEECH IN REPLY TO CORPORATION 			ADDRESS, ERNAKULAM    March 	8, 1925  	I thank you very sincerely for the address and the sentiments 	expressed in it. It is a matter of great sorrow to me that, at the 	present moment, I have not beside me my friend Maulana Shaukat Ali 	or Maulana Mahomed Ali. As you know we had become almost inseparable 	in all our travels in India. One of the brothers, however, is today 	immersed in his journalism and the other Big Brother has practically 	buried himself in and about Bombay. As I have arrived in this 	Presidency purely for the sake of visiting Vykom and entering the 	zone, where my work chiefly lies, during the present visit, it 	pleases me to receive this address from you. This is an errand of 	peace and I want all the assistance that I can receive from public 	opinion throughout the length and breadth of this land. Above all, I 	want the prayers of those who believe in prayers, whether they are 	HIndus, Mussalmans, Christians, Jews or Parsis. Whatever faith they 	may belong to, if they believe in prayers I want their prayers for 	the success of my mission.  	There are other things also in which I am interested and  in which 	you should also be interested. It makes no  difference whatsoever 	whether you belong to British India proper or to one of the 	Protected States. I refer to Hindu-Muslim unity which is a form of 	unity amongst all the races professing the various religions of 	India. I know that in this State you have no such question, as I 	understand, as between Hindus and Muslims or between Hindus and 	other races. It is a matter of great pleasure to me to find that in 	this State all the races are living in peace, amity and brotherhood. 	Let that state of things last 
 for ever. But I am afraid I am unable to pay you the same tribute so far as the spinning-wheel is concerned. I took the oppor-tunity, in replying to the address of the Madras Corporation, of mentioning the fact that no municipality’s work in India can be considered to be complete until that municipality had identified itself with the lowest of its citizens. One often learns that the order is really reversed, that is to say, the municipalities give to those who have much and take away much from those who have very little. They care more for the rich and the powerful and little or less for the poor and down-trodden. (“Hear, hear.”) I hope that it is not true of this town and that you are observing the proper order of things. I therefore suggest the spinning- wheel only by way of addition. It is to me a symbol of inseparable connection between the rich and the poor. It is the one certain definite solution for the poverty of the masses of India. I ask you therefore to introduce the spinning-wheel in your schools and also its product, khaddar. I ask you to give it a sacred place in your homes as it occupied years and years ago. I have not hesitated to call it one of the yajnas of this age and as the great ones do, so do the lower order of beings follow. You will not therefore be able success-fully to carry the message of the spinning-wheel to the humble homes of India, unless you adopt it yourselves. May you have the courage and the strength and the goodwill to follow the advice that I have humbly tendered to you!

         FRIENDS,    SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, COCHIN    March 	8, 1925 
  	It gives me much pleasure to be able to meet you. When I decided to 	come to Vykom, I little thought that it would be possible and 	necessary for me to stay here before proceeding there. I know that 	yours is a historic city. It is full of all kinds of vivid 	recollections, not all of them of a pleasant type. Living on the 	seaside you are aware of what adventure can do. The sea is an 	epitome of adventures. At the present moment, however, I am not 	concerned with the adventures that the sea offers. What we need is 	the spirit of adventure in our national life and if we find that we 	have made but little progress towards our 
 goal, it is because the spirit of adventure is absent from us. It requires for instance an adventurous spirit to find out in the Hindu religion its black spots. Those who are not fired with that spirit are satisfied with things as they are. They do not stop to enquire whether they are good or bad; but ever since I have been in India, after my sojourn in South Africa for a period of nearly 20 years, I have been telling the Hindus that we have in our religion a black spot which must be removed. It is untouchability and here I am sorry to add also unapproachability. I have not come in order to argue with the orthodox people. I have come with a message of peace. I want to plead wisdom and tell them that this untouchability and unapproacha-bility cannot be part of Hinduism. I have come to tell them that the satyagrahis who are fighting against enormous odds at Vykom are not out to destroy religion, but to reform it. I have come to tell them of all the implications of this struggle. I have come to tell them also that it is wrong for us to be satisfied with things as they are, if we find that they are bad. It, therefore, gives me pleasure that I shall be carrying with me your blessings and your sympathy, for in the address presented to me on your behalf by the municipality I am assured of  your  sympathy and support. I want you also to carry the same spirit a little further and I want you to find with me that one of the most potent causes of the ever-deepening poverty of the masses is that they have nothing to do for nearly a third part of the year throughout India. I would like you to discover with me that if we give them the spinning- wheel which had a place in every home in India only a hundred years ago, they will find enough to occupy themselves during their leisure hours. But the introduction of the spinning-wheel in the millions of our homes will be a perfectly useless thing if we do not discard the use of foreign cloth or mill-made cloth.
 In going about, therefore, from place to place I am pleading with those men and women whom I see that it is their bounden duty to discard the use of foreign cloth and mill-made cloth and replace it with hand-spun and hand-woven khaddar. For you in Malabar plenty of clothing is a burden. I have no doubt that I am an object of envy with most of you. In this weather of ours the least we have in the shape of clothing the better it is from every point of view. I wish you will not run away with the idea that dignity or civilization requires multipli-
 cation of clothing. (Laughter and “hear, hear!”) “Handsome is not who is handsome clothed, but handsome is who handsome does.” The truest test of civilization, culture and dignity is character and not clothing. I feel overwhelmed with sorrow whenever I find the people in India telling me that they have outgrown khaddar and that it is impossible for them to return to the savage days when our ancestors were satisfied with khaddar clothing. I would like you to answer with me the critics who think in that way, that the best way of ridding India of the curse of poverty and pauperism is for one and all of us to be dressed in khaddar. Those of you who will go in for fineries and fineness, it is possible for you to get as fine a hand-spun yarn as you wish to. I hope therefore that you will tax yourselves, tax your minds and dot every home in Cochin with the spinning-wheel and see to it that everyone in Cochin uses khaddar and nothing else.
 I need say nothing about the Hindu-Muslim question. I know that you miss the presence of one of the Ali Brothers. It has been usual for one of them to be touring with me throughout India. But it was not possible to do so this time. But I wish to congratulate you on the freedom from this taxing problem in your midst. It is a matter of great pleasure to me to find that all the communities belonging to the different religions are living in a spirit of goodwill and brother-hood in this State. I wish that we could in every part of India copy your worthy examples. May God give you the strength and the wisdom to introduce khaddar and the spinning-wheel in your homes and to rid Hinduism of the curse of untouchability! May all the races inhabiting this fair land remain for ever united as they are today!

   LETTER TO DR. VARADARAJULU NAIDU  
 March 10, 1925
DEAR DR. VARADARAJULU,
 With reference to the Gurukul controversylibtech_503_footnoteI told Mr. Iyerlibtech_504_footnotethat I would not give a definite opinion unless I had seen you and heard you. Having heard you, it seems to me that in so far as the present brahmacharis are concerned, if the parents of the Brahmin boys insist on their boys being allowed to dine separately, their scruples should be respected. But, for the future, it may be announced that no brahmacharis would be accepted whose parents would not let their boys dine in the same row with the others. I understand from you that the cook at the Gurukul would be always a Brahmin. What you object to (and that properly) is the separating of non-Brahmin boys from the Brahmins. I do think that all the boys should sit in the same row whilst they are taking their meals.
 Yours sincerely,

   DISCUSSION WITH CASTE HINDU LEADERS, VYKOMlibtech_505_footnote  
 [March 10, 1925]
 GANDHIJI: Is it fair to exclude a whole section of Hindus, because of their supposed lower birth, from public roads which can be used by non-Hindus, by criminals and bad characters, and even by dogs and cattle?
 NAMBUDIRI TRUSTEE: How can it be helped? They are reaping the reward of their
 
 karma.   G.	No 	doubt they are suffering for their karma by being born 
  	as untouchables. But why must you add to the punishment? Are they 	worse than even criminals and beasts?   They 		must be so, for otherwise God would not have condemned them to be 		born untouchables.   G. But 	God may punish them. Who are we human beings to take the place of 	God and add to the punishment?  N. 	  We are but instruments. God uses us as His instruments in order to 	impose   on 	them the 	punishment that their 	karma has earned 	for them.  G. But 	supposing the avarnas said that they were instruments in the 	hands of God in order to impose afflictions on you? What would you 	do?  N. 	Then Government would stand between them and us and prevent them 	from so doing. Good men would do so. Mahatmaji, we beseech you to 	prevent the avarnas 	from depriving us of 	our age-old privileges.  G.  Will 	 you  prove  to  me  that  you  are  entitled  to  prevent them from 	 using the  roads? I  am  sure  that   the   suppressed  classes 	have as much right to use  the  roads  as  you  have.  The Shastras  	nowhere  lay  down  that  they  may  not  use   these   roads. Do 	you know that even the Dewan thinks that you have taken up a     invitation 	the local 	orthodox caste 	Hindu oppositionist 	leaders at the 	residence of 	Indanthurithi 	Nambyathiri. Among those who 	accompanied Mr. 	Gandhi were Messrs 	Rajagopalachari, Mahadev 	Desai, Ramdas Gandhi and Krishnaswami Iyer. 	 He discussed 	with them for over 	three hours and made 	certain practical proposals with a 	view to 	bringing the 	struggle to 	a speedy 	termination. These 	alternative proposals 	were an 	arbitration, a 	referendum, an 	examination by 	select pandits of 	the Sankara 	Smritis. The oppositionists did not choose to accept any of these.” 
 wrong attitude?
 N. How does the Dewan’s opinion help us? He is welcome to hold what opinion he likes. And why, Mahatmaji, do you use the word “suppressed” for these classes? Do you know why they are “suppressed”?
 G. Oh, yes! Just for the same reason that Dyer massacred the innocents in Jallianwala.
 N. So you think those who introduced the custom were Dyers? You would call Shankaracharya a Dyer?
 G. I am calling no Acharya a Dyer. But I do characterize your action as Dyerism, and if indeed any Acharya was responsible for introducing this custom his ignorance was as monstrous as that of General Dyer.
 N. But how can we give up an ancient custom? You say the satyagrahis are going through suffering. Suffering is entirely on our side. The satyagrahis sit at the gates of the temples. Their shadow would pollute us and so we have to take a long and circuitous way to the temple. Is that not a great hardship?
 G. That surely is extraordinary. It reminds one of the old story  of the wolf and the lamb. I beseech you to talk with some reason at least.
 N.	Reason is out of place in matters religious.
 G. If this is an ancient sanatani custom it must  obtain everywhere in India. But I do not find it in any other part of the country.
 N. Surely untouchability is there is every part of  India.  We  carry untouchability a little further. That is all.
 G. You say these people are worse than criminals. Supposing they became Mussalmans or Christians tomorrow. Would they then cease to be criminals?
 (The Nambudiri remained silent. But the Devaswom Commissioner answered on his behalf: No fresh Christian or Mussalman convert would have the right. It is old Christians and Mussalmans who enjoy the right.)
 C. RAJAGOPALACHARI (who was present at the interview): So Christians and Mussalmans may upset God’s rules and regulations?
 (No Reply.)
 G. You cite Shankaracharya’s authority in support of your contention. Will you show it to me?
 N.	Yes.
 G.	And if Shankaracharya’s books do not support the custom will you withdraw your opposition?
 N.	There is enough evidence there. But of course you may explain it away.
 G.	No, I will not explain it away. We will have it interpreted by recognized pandits.
 N.	If the interpretation goes against the custom we cannot accept it.
 G. So then there is no authority in Shankaracharya’s books,  but in your own lack of reason? Well, supposing the court were to decide that the roads should be opened to the avarnas?
 N.	We should use the roads no longer, and we should leave the temples.
 G. And if the Maharaja were to issue a smriti throwing open the roads like the Shankaracharya Smriti that you claim there is in support of the prohibition, what will you do?
 N.	The State has authority to issue what smriti it likes. We should have to obey it.
 G. I beseech you not to forget that you are the trustee of  Hinduism, and I hope you will not besmirch its fair name. Well, let me suggest a compromise. Would you accept a referendum?
 N.	A referendum of only the temple-going public?
 G.	That’s not fair. I mean a referendum of all savarnas, I don’t say of all avarnas. That should satisfy you.
 (No reply.)
 G. Another suggestion. Supposing we ask a recognized pandit  in India to interpret the Shankara Smriti? Would you accept his interpretation?
 N.	There may be no authority in the Smriti, but there would be sufficient authority found in the commentary on the Smriti.
 (An old man at this stage exclaimed: It was Parashurama who gave us the whole of Malabar. Now if you were to ask us to produce Parashurama’s charter, how can we do so? Similar is the present right. How can we produce authority for it?)
G.	A last alternative. Would you accept arbitration? You
appoint a pandit, I appoint a pandit on behalf of the satyagrahis, and the Dewan acts as Umpire. What do you say to that?
 (No reply.)

 FRIENDS,
   SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, VYKOM  
 March 10, 1925
  	I know you will excuse me for not standing up to speak to you, and I 	hope you will also excuse me for being a few minutes late. I can 	only give you my assurance that my being late was due to no delay on 	my part. I have been occupied the whole day long with the mission 	that has brought me here. It gives me very great pleasure to see 	such a large assembly here, because it enables me to tell you the 	purpose of my mission.  	At the outset, however, I wish to thank all those who presented me 	with addresses yesterday; at the time the address was presented, a 	letter was delivered into my hands protesting against that address 	and assuring me that it did not represent the sentiments of all the 	people in Vykom (“Shame!”). I gladly accept that protest and 	inform you of it. The very fact of the letter having been signed by 	a few gentlemen shows at least that they were not in sympathy with 	the address or rather the wording of it. Nor does it surprise me 	that the address did not carry the consent of all the people of 	Vykom. I know that you are unfortunately divided here over a very 	vital question. So far as I am concerned, I would be happier without 	any address whatsoever, but when I do receive addresses, they give 	me a topic of conversation with the meetings which I address and 	this address does show that in a most particular manner. I thank 	those who have pres-ented me with the address this evening also. 	That too deals with the subject that has brought me here and that is 	the subject of untouch-ability and unapproachability and the method, 	namely, satyagraha, adopted in Vykom in order to rid this place of 	unapproachability in a particular way. As you are aware, that 	struggle from its very inception has commanded my deep admiration 	and sympathy. It is possible that the conductors of satyagraha may 	have made mistakes in the campaign. Who is there in the world who is 	infallible? But I am satisfied that the mistakes, if any were 	committed, were not deliberate. Satyagraha, like the name itself, is 	a somewhat new doctrine, or rather a new presentation of an old 	doctrine. The 	 question  of  untouchability  is  one  which  lends  itself  to  	the method of  satyagraha  in   a  peculiar  manner,  for  	satyagraha  is a method of suffering, not suffering imposed upon 	those who are opposed  to   you,   but   suffering  imposed   upon  	oneself.   Now the 
 position taken up by the satyagrahis at Vykom is that the roads that pass by the great temple should be open to those who are considered to be untouchables or unapproachables. The claim is based upon humanity itself. Any road which is open to the public, so  far  as Hindus are concerned, any road that is open to those who are caste Hindus, should and does claim to be open to those who are thrown out of caste and considered untouchables or unapproachables. In my humble opinion, it is a natural and just claim. As you know, ever since I set my foot on Indian soil after a long exile in South Africa, I have been speaking frankly, fearlessly and freely on the question of untouchability. I claim to be a sanatani Hindu. I claim to know sufficient of the Shastras for my own purpose and I venture to suggest that untouchability and unapproachability, as they are practised in this holy land of ours, have no place or sanction in the Hindu Shastras. (“Hear, hear”, and cheers.) Neither approve nor disapprove, but simply listen to my remarks. I venture to suggest to those who are professors of Hinduism, who hold Hinduism as dear as life itself, that Hinduism like every other religion, apart from the sanction  of  Shastras, has got to submit itself to the test of universal reason.
 In this age of reason, in this age of universal knowledge, in this age of education and comparative theology, any religion which entrenches itself behind Shastric injunctions and authority is, in my own humble opinion, bound to fail. In my opinion, untouchability is a blot upon humanity and therefore upon Hinduism. It cannot stand the test of reason. It is in conflict with the fundamental precepts of Hinduism. The first among the three principles I am about to enunciate of Hinduism is Satyannasti paro dharmah,libtech_506_footnotelibtech_507_footnotei.e., there is no religion other than or higher than truth. The second is  Ahimsa  paramo dharmah and if ahimsa, meaning love, non-violence, is the law of life, is the greatest religion, is the only religion, then I suggest to you that untouchability is in direct conflict with that truth. The third is that God alone is Truth and everything else is transitory and illusory. If it is so, I suggest to you that it is impossible for us to reconcile untouchability and unapp-roachability with the grand doctrine. I have come, therefore, to reason with my orthodox friends.  I have come to plead with them, and by their courtesy and goodwill. I was able to wait upon them this afternoon. They gave me a patient hearing and listened to me. We argued, I appealed to their reason, I appealed to their humanity, I appealed to the Hinduism in them. I am
 
 sorry to confess to you that I was not able to produce an impression that I had expected I would be able to do. But “despair” is a term which does not occur in my dictionary. (Laughter.) I shall despair when I despair of myself, of God and humanity. But as I believe in God, as I believe in the fact that we are all met here together and as I believe also in humanity, because I see that in spite of all our differences, all our quarrels, humanity lives on, I believe also that the truth that I claim I represent for the time being, will impress itself upon my orthodox friends here.
 I have made three sporting offers to these friends of mine. In the name and on behalf of the satyagrahis of Vykom, those offers are binding on me, but I have left them free to reject or accept them. I have pleaded with them that they should accept these offers even though it may be by way of trial. I have not hesitated to enter into such unilateral contract because I believe in the truth that I implicitly believe and stand for. For I have come not to precipitate and enhance the quarrel, but to bring about peace and goodwill between the orthodox section and those who are today trying to act in the name of humanity and justice. Though I may seem at times to be fighting, my purpose is never to fight, nor have I undertaken a fight to prolong it, but to bring about peace at the shortest possible notice. An English friend when I embarked upon non-co-operation, told me that my non-co-operation was only skin-deep but that I was pining for co- operation. I immediately closed with him and I told him that he had read my heart correctly, and so it is with my orthodox friends, I assure them. Satyagraha is there, but to be called off as soon as they wish it, it  is for them to make a sporting offer and it will be accepted, only let them beware of murdering truth. A satyagrahi has always his minimum and it is the minimum that is wanted in connection with this struggle. The right of way is such a reasonable demand that it has only to be asked to be given. Let it be understood, therefore, that there is no mental reservation behind this struggle.
 I have repeatedly told the Hindus of India what the removal of untouchability means to me and  to  those  who  are  today  en- gaged  in  that  holy  campaign.  It   does   not   mean   the   breaking up of Varnashrama dharma. It does not mean inter-dining or inter marriages. But it does mean the common relations between man and man that should exist in any civilized society. It does mean that places of worship should be open if they are at all open to anybody, to all those who are considered Hindus. But I grant that if there is a
 particular class, say, Brahmins, who want to build temples and exclude non-Brahmins from them. I say that it is their right to do so. But if there is a temple which is open to non-Brahmins also, then there is no such thing as a fifth caste which may be put out of that temple. I see no warrant for such an exclusion in the Hindu Shastras. Similarly I claim that public places such as schools should be open alike to the untouchables, if they are open to other classes. So would it be with watering places such as wells, lakes and rivers. That is the whole of my claim on behalf of those who are engaged in this campaign against untouchability and unapproachability.
 Let me, however, clear the position a little so far as Vykom is concerned. The present satyagraha is merely directed towards vindicating the right of the unapproachables to pass through the roads through which Christians and Mussalmans and caste Hindus are entitled to pass. Satyagrahis today are not fighting for entry into temples. They are not fighting—I do not know if there is any prohibition in the schools of Travancore—they are not fighting for admission in the schools, not that such is not their claim. But I am presenting you today the implications of the present struggle. Since satyagraha is a method of conversion and conviction, it seeks never to use the slightest coercion. I therefore gladly endorse in its entirety the remarks made by the Dewan Sahib in his addresslibtech_508_footnotelibtech_509_footnoteto the Travancore Assembly, and if I find the satyagrahis in Vykom in denial of their own faith use violence or any other method in order to put undue pressure upon the orthodox Hindus of Vykom, you will find me, on proof given to me, entirely dissociating myself from those satyagrahis so-called. But so long as satyagrahis keep within the terms of their contract, so long shall I consider it to be my bounden duty to give them all the assistance that a single, humble individual is capable of giving. I plead, therefore, with all the force at my command that the orthodox Brahmins and non-Brahmins of Vykom who may be opposed to this campaign study it in all its bearings, to apply their reason to bear upon the struggle and stand for justice and humanity; if they find that this struggle is just and the means adopted by the satyagrahis to vindicate the right of humanity are also fair, reasonable and non-violent.
 I am glad to be able to bear my testimony to the happy relations that have hitherto subsisted generally between the police authorities and the satyagrahis; they have shown how a decent gentlemanly battle can be carried on without any vexation, without any hard swearing
 
 and without violence. I know that prejudices die hard. Untouchability is an error of long standing. I have, therefore, told my satyagrahi friends that they will have to exercise tremendous patience.
 Time is always on the side of those who will wait upon it. Public opinion, I hope, even of Vykom, is on their side. Public opinion outside Vykom, I know, is on their side. The world opinion is growing strong on their side and if the satyagrahis will only play the game well, have patience and will be able to endure silent and slow sufferings, I have no doubt that victory is theirs. The Government of Travancore, so far as I can see from the address of the Dewan Sahib, has held the scales evenly between the two parties. I know that my satyagrahi  friends here shook their heads when I told them that the presentation by the Dewan was not open to exception. Whatever the truth may be, there is no doubt about it that the credit will be yours if the two sections of the community meet together and find a reasonable and honourable solution for the difficulty without the intervention of the Government. The Dewan himself, so far as his own opinion is concerned, has told the orthodox people where his opinion lies. He invites them to march with the times, to recognize the time spirit. I hope my orthodox friends will listen to the sound advice given by him. In any event, I give them my best assurance that no matter what they think of it, no matter how they behave, whether they accept my offers or reject them, I shall only do according to the behests of the Hindu religion as I know it. I recognize no one as my enemy on the face of the earth. I shall, therefore, love them in spite of differences between them and myself. I shall ever pray to God that he may guide their steps in the right direction, open the eyes of their understanding, open their eyes to the writing on the wall and render justice to these down-trodden countrymen of ours. I am humble enough also to pray to God at the same time that if I have misread the Hindu Shastras, if I have misread humanity, and have erred in giving the advice that I have tendered to the satyagrahis, He will open my eyes also, show me my error and give me strength and the necessary courage to acknowledge my error and apologize to my orthodox friends.
One thing more and I  have done. When there is  a  difference
 between you and me on the question of untouchability, I hope there is no question of difference of opinion about another matter which also concerns the poorest of the land. I refer to the spinning-wheel and khaddar. You owe it to the poorest in the land to find a sacred corner in your homes for the spinning-wheel and you owe it to them that you
 wear the product of the spinning-wheel and place a few coppers in the pockets of the poorest of your countrymen and countrywomen. I shall not be satisfied as I have said repeatedly until the prince and the peasant, the Viceroy and his page, are clad from top to toe in khaddar, hand-spun and hand-made.
 The third thing I need not mention to you, namely, the Hindu- Muslim unity. You have in this connection much to teach to the rest of India. All the different races and communities belonging to different religions, I am happy to be able to know and testify, are living in perfect harmony and friendship in Travancore. I hope that the rest of India will copy the admirable spirit which actuates you. I thank you all for the very patient hearing you have kindly given to me and I now close with the hope and fervent prayer that the battle that is going on in Vykom may end in the only manner it should. (Cheers.)

 [March 11, 1925]libtech_511_footnote
 (The following is almost a verbatim report of the quiet talk I gave to the inmates of the Satyagraha Ashram at Vykom. The Ashram has at the present moment over fifty volunteers who stand or squat in front of the four barricades which are put up to guard the four entrances to the Vykom temple. They spin whilst they are stationed there and remain there at a stretch for six hours. They are sent in two relays. I reproduce the talk as being of general interest and applicable to all satyagrahis. M.K.G.)
 I am sorry that I shall be going away today without having a chat with you which I would regard as complete and satisfactory. But it seems it is not possible to do more. Those in charge of arrange- ments about my programme are of opinion that I ought to see, in order to help the cause, more places than Vykom. I have yielded to their advice but my own conviction based on past experience is that the success of the movement depends more on yourselves than on outside support. If there is nothing in you, any amount of enthusiasm
 
 
 brought about by a passing visit like mine will be of no avail. But if I had not come here and there had been no enthusiasm on the part of the public, and if you had been true to yourselves there would have been nothing wanting. Your work would have commanded all the enthusiasm that might have been needed for a cause like this. Therefore if I could have passed here a longer time than I have, it would have been more profitable. However, that could not be done in face of the advice of friends who are guiding me.
 But I want to tell you as briefly as I can what I expect of you. I would ask you to forget the political aspect of the programme. Political consequences of this struggle there are, but you are not to concern yourselves with them. If you do, you will miss the true result and also miss the political consequences, and when the real heat of the struggle is touched you will be found wanting. I am therefore anxious, even if it frightens you, to explain to you the true nature of the struggle. It is a struggle deeply religious for the Hindus. We are endeavouring to rid Hinduism of its greatest blot. The prejudice we have to fight against is an age-long prejudice. The struggle for the opening of the roads round the temple which we hold to be public to the unapproachables is but a small skirmish in the big battle. If our struggle was to end with the opening of the roads in Vykom you may be sure I would not have bothered my head about it. If therefore you think that the struggle is to end with opening of the roads in Vykom to the unapproachables you are mistaken. The road must be opened. It has got to be opened. But that will be the beginning of the end. The end is to get all such roads throughout Travancore to be opened to the unapproachables; and not only that, but we expect that our efforts may result in amelioration of the general condition of the untou- chables and unapproachables. That will require tremendous sacrifice. For our aim is not to do things by violence to opponents. That will be con-version by violence or compulsion, and if we import compulsion in matters of religion, there is no doubt that we shall be committing sui-cide. We should carry on this struggle on the lines of strict non- violence, i.e., by suffering in our own persons. That is the meaning of satyagraha. The question is whether you are capable of every suffering that may be imposed upon you or may be your lot in the journey towards the goal. Even whilst you are suffering, you may have no bitterness—no trace of it—against your opponents. And I tell you it is not a mechanical act at all. On the contrary I want you to feel like loving your opponents and the way to do it is to give them the
 same credit for honesty of purpose which you would claim for yourself. I know that it is a difficult task. I confess that it was a difficult task for me yesterday whilst I was talking to those friends who insisted on their right to exclude the unapproachables from the temple roads. I confess there was selfishness behind their talk. How then was I to credit them with honesty of purpose? I was thinking of this thing yesterday and also this morning, and this is what I did. I asked myself: “Wherein was their selfishness or self interest? It is true that they have their ends to serve. But so have we our ends to serve. Only we consider our ends to be pure and therefore selfless. But who is to determine where selflessness ends and selfishness begins. Selflessness may be the purest form of selfishness”. I do not say this for the sake of argument. But that is what I really feel. I am considering their condition of mind from their point of view and not my own. Had they not been Hindu they would not have talked as they did yesterday. And immediately we begin to think of things as our opponents think of them we shall be able to do them full justice. I know that this requires a detached state of mind, and it is a state very difficult to reach. Nevertheless for a satyagrahi it is absolutely essential. Three fourths of the miseries and misunderstandings in the world will disappear, if we step into the shoes of our adversaries and understand their standpoint. We will then agree with our adversaries quickly or think of them charitably.
 In our case there is no question of our agreeing with them quickly as our ideals are radically different. But we may be charitable to them and believe that they actually mean what they say. They do not want to open the roads to the unapproachables. Now whether it is their self-interest or ignorance that tells them to say so, we really believe that it is wrong of them to say so. Our business therefore is to show them that they are in the wrong and we should do so by our suffering. I have found that mere appeal to reason does not answer where prejudices are age-long and based on supposed religious authority. Reason has to be strengthened by suffering and suffering opens the eyes of understanding. Therefore there must be no trace of compulsion in our acts. We must not be impatient, and we must have an undying faith in the means we are adopting. The means we are adopting just now are that we approach the four barricades and as we are stopped there we sit down and spin away from day to day, and we must believe that through it the roads must be opened. I know that it is  a difficult and slow process. But if you believe in the efficacy of
 
 satyagraha you will rejoice in this slow torture and suffering, and you will not feel the discomfort of your position as you go and sit in the boiling sun from day to day. If you have faith in the cause and the means and in God the hot sun will be cool for you. You must not be tired and say “how long”, and never get irritated. That is only a small portion of your penance for the sin for which Hinduism is responsible.
 I regard you as soldiers in this campaign. It is not possible for you to reason out things for yourselves. You have  come to  the Ashram because you have faith in the management . That does not mean faith in me. For I am not manager. I am directing the movement so far as ideals and general direction are concerned. Your faith therefore must be in those who are managers for the time being. The choice before coming to the Ashram was yours. But having made your choice and come to the Ashram it is not for you to reason why. If we are to become a powerful nation you must obey all directions that may be given to you from time to time. That is the only way in which either political or religious life can be built up. You must have determined for yourselves certain principles and you must have joined the struggle in obedience to those principles. Those who remain in the Ashram are taking as much part in the struggle as those who go and offer satyagraha at the barricades. Every piece of work in connection with the struggle is just as important as any other piece, and therefore the work of sanitation in the Ashram is just as important as spinning away at the barricades. And if in this place the work of cleaning the closets and compound is more distasteful than spinning it should be considered far more important and profitable. Not a single minute should be wasted in idle conversation, but we must be absorbed in the work before us and if everyone of us works in that spirit you will see that there is pleasure in the work itself. Every bit of property, anything in the Ashram, should be regarded by you as your own property and not property that can be wasted at pleasure. You may not waste a grain of rice or a scrap of paper, and similarly a minute of your time. It is not ours. It belongs to the nation and we are trustees for the use of it.
 I know that all this will sound hard and difficult for you. My presentation may be hard, but it has not been possible for me to present the thing in any other way. For it will be wrong on my part if I deceive you or myself in believing that this is an easy thing.
Much corruption has crept into our religion. We have become
 lazy as a nation, we have lost the time sense. Selfishness dominates our action. There is mutual jealousy amongst the tallest of us. We are uncharitable to one another. And if I did not draw your attention to the things I have, it will not be possible for us to rid ourselves of all these evils. Satyagraha is a relentless search for truth and a determination to search truth. I can only hope you will realize the import of what you are doing. And if you do, your path will be easy—easy because you will take delight in difficulties and you will laugh in hope when everybody is in despair. I believe in  the illustrations rishis or poets have given in religious books. For example, I literally believe in the possibility of a Sudhanvalibtech_512_footnotelibtech_513_footnotesmiling away whilst he was being drowned in the boiling oil. For to him it was greater torture to forget his Maker than to be in boiling oil. And so it can be in a lesser measure here, if we have a spark of Sudhanva’s faith in this struggle.libtech_514_footnote
 Mahatmaji was then put a series of questions by the workers. Mr. T. R. Krishnaswamy Iyer, M.A.,B.L.,asked how long the struggle should be continued. Mahatmaji said:
 I do not know. It may last a few days, or for ever. I embarked on the South African struggle fancying that it would be over in a month’s time but it lasted eight years.
 Asked as to why batches in large numbers should not be sent to the barricades, he stated that it would result in disturbance and misunderstanding, and secondly, they had not sufficient numbers for the purpose. He thought good deal must be done by way  of consolidating public opinion. It was claimed that public opinion was on their side which was correct to a certain extent, but that public opinion had not been rendered effective and that meant tremendous organization which they lacked. He saw no use in forcing the pace and advised the workers to learn Hindi in three months, also Sanskrit and engage themselves in work of some kind which should in the long run make the institution thoroughly self-supporting. Mahatmaji opined that if subscriptions were solicited from outside Kerala and Travancore, it should have a demoralizing effect and mentioned that in Champaran he had offers of money from all sources but did not accept them except from a private friend, that at the time of the labour strike in Ahmedabad he rejected offers of thousands of rupees from a single individual. In the Kheda campaign he accepted something from personal friends and not even half of
 
 what was given had been spent. From South Africa he brought back three to four lakhs  of rupees. He could not recall a single battle he had fought where there was a debit balance and the amounts in every case were obtained with the minimum amount of trouble and fuss.

   NATIONAL EDUCATION  
An Assistant Principal in a national institution writes:
 In order to save the young generation from the slave mentality created in the Government schools, the national education movement was started on a large scale in the first decade of this century. It only aimed at establishing schools where education was imparted “on national lines and under national control.”. . . It undoubtedly produced a band of workers many of whom have taken a vigorous part in the struggle for freedom. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that as a purely educational movement, it had neither a separate source nor a separate existence . . . .
 The non-co-operation movement gave a second impetus—indeed a tremendous one– to the cause of national education. Hundreds of mushroom schools sprang into existence all over the country. Their object was also limited in scope. They mainly aimed at accommodating the N.C.O. students for one year only. The boys were to be made “Swaraj Soldiers”, i.e., workers to carry out the different items of N.C.O. Here again the educational movement had no existence separate from the political one. When the latter lost its force, the former became feeble and infirm.
 The result is that national education has always been given a secondary or subordinate place in the programme and no scientific and independent thought has ever been accorded to it by any leader. It seems that with you it is not as dear as khaddar, or it may be that with you khaddar and national education mean one and the same thing! The Swarajists are enamoured only of the Councils. Taking these facts into consideration is it possible for the movement to make any progress? And if it meets with failure now and again, will it not produce a lamentable and discouraging effect upon the majority of the people?. . . .
 The aim of education  is  to  develop   the   physical  and  mental   organs of children so as to make them worthy citizens of their country. This can only be done  when boys are in the secondary schools. Before  that they are too young and after that their character will have taken already a
 particular  bent difficult  to  be  turned   to   any   other   desirable   direction. Now according to your opinion, the age in secondary schools  is  to  be  devoted mainly to hand-spinning, hand-weaving and everything connected with it. Is not that education unnatural and oppressive where students of varied capabilities	and different aptitudes are cramped together in one and the same mould?. . . .
 Hand-spinning and hand-weaving may become one item of the curriculum, but it cannot and must not become the whole. It is not better to lay down some broad fundamental and definite principles of national education and give every institution discretion to act according to its requirements, capabilities and the calibre of the students?. . . .
 During the last forty years or more, a number of experiments were tried in the field of national education. Can you point out at least one institution, the model of which we can proudly ask the Government to imitate?
 The whole world is advancing in material civilization, without which we shall certainly be handicapped. It is now a settled fact that India fell a prey to western nations because she was wanting in scientific and material progress. History has taught this lesson and it cannot be overlooked. But you never seem to give much importance to subjects like physics and chemistry. Is this not strange?
I do not know the conditions of 1906 but I do know those of
 1921. National education to be truly national must reflect the national condition for the time being. And as the national condition at present is one of uncertainty national education too must remain in a more or less uncertain condition. How do children fare in a besieged place? Do they not according to their capacity take part in repelling the attack of the besiegers and suit themselves to the changing circumst- ances? Is that not their true education? Is not education the art of drawing out full manhood of the children under training? The greatest drawback of the present system of education is that it does not bear the stamp of reality, that the children do not react to the varying wants of the country. True education must correspond to the surrounding circumstances or it is not a healthy growth. The necessity of this response was the object of non-co-operation in  education. True, we have not acted up to the ideal. That is because of our limitations, because we are unable to shake off the hypnotic effect of our surroundings.
 But this is not to say that our educational institutions must become mere spinning and weaving  institutes.  I  do  regard  spin- ning and weaving as the necessary part of any national system of
 education. I  do  not  aim  at  taking  the  whole  of the  childrens’  time for this purpose. Like a skilled physician I tend and  con- centrate my attention on the diseased limb knowing that that is the best way of looking after the others. I would develop in the  child his hands, his brain and his soul. The hands have almost atrophied. The soul has been altogether ignored. I therefore put in a plea in season and out of season for correcting these grave defects in our education. Is half an hour’s spinning every day by our children too great a strain upon them? Will it result in mental paralysis?
 I value education in the different sciences. Our children cannot have too much of chemistry and physics. And if these have not been attended to in the institutions in which I am directly supposed to be interested, it is because we have not the professors for the purpose and also because practical training in these sciences requires very expensive laboratories for which in the present state of uncertainty and infancy we are not ready.

   SOUTH AFRICA  
 Things are clearly going from bad to worse in South Africa and there is no telling where they will end. In two separate measures, which have been put forward by the Government in power, “Asiatics” are discriminated against and classed with “Native”, as contrasted with the “Coloured”, people. It is somewhat difficult for those who have never been to  South  Africa  to understand clearly what such discrimination means. What has to be realized is that the great bulk of the “Native” population is entirely uneducated. On the other hand, the “Coloured” people (i.e., those who have a slight mixture of European blood in their veins) are on the whole a fairly literate community. It appears that the policy of the new Government, under General Hertzog is to depress still further the “Asiatic” and to raise the status of the “Coloured” people.
 A further measure is scheduled, whereby South African citizenship will be confined to the pure white population, which has been born and bred in South Africa. An Englishman coming out straight from England will not have his citizenship in South Africa as an inherent right on account of his English birth and origin. He will have to take out naturalization papers in South Africa. Leading newspapers in South Africa suggest that a compact has been made between the Labour Party (which relies chiefly on the British labour
 vote) and the Nationalist Party (which relies chiefly on the Dutch vote) on the understanding that the Nationalist will support a strong anti-Asiatic labour policy provided that the labourites will support a strong “burgher” policy.
 In addition to this, we have the further news that a new segregation measure, of even more drastic character than the late “Class Areas Bill”, is already being prepared. It will be remembered that the Municipal Franchise Act for Natal, depriving Indians in future of municipal franchise, has now been passed and sanctioned by the Governor-General. If a racial Segregation Act is also passed, it will be difficult to see what will still remain of “vested rights”, which were to be strictly observed under the Smuts-Gandhi Agreement of 1914.
 In the Transvaal, a picketing system and a boycott of all Indian trade has again been started. This time, in the present inflamed atmosphere— it has met with some measure of success. The repatriation of Indians in Natal by means of Government “recruiters” is still proceeding. I have personally cross- examined those in Madras who have returned. They have told me that they have been unable to find employment in India. They are therefore now to be found, after great misery and privation, entering the emigration depot for Malaya, asking to be sent out of India to the rubber plantations of the Federated Malaya States. Truly the whole situation of Indians in South Africa has reached the lowest point where even stout hearts may find it difficult to look forward to the future with hope. There is one redeeming feature, however, which continually meets us in every fresh information that reaches us in India. The Hindu-Muslim problem out there does not exist. In face of common suffering Indians are one people—one in heart and soul as well as one in Indian birth.libtech_515_footnote
 In view of the foregoing gloomy study of the situation in South Africa,  the  remarks  of  General  Smuts  quoted  last  weeklibtech_516_footnotein   these columns derive an added interest. The picketing referred to by Mr. Andrews is nothing but veiled coercion. If with all the elaborate precautions it did not remain peaceful everywhere in India in 1921, how less likely it is to be peaceful in South Africa, only those who know its white population can realize.

   SWADESHI AND NATIONALISM  
The following from a friend has been on my file for a long
 
 No doubt you have read M. Romain Rolland’s book entitled Mahatma Gandhi. On page 176libtech_517_footnoteof this book appears this paragraph: “What is this but the triumph of nationalism—the narrowest and most unpolluted?  Stay  at home, shut all doors, change nothing, hold on to everything. Export nothing, buy nothing, uplift and purify body and spirit! A gospel indeed of medieval monks! And Gandhi of the broad mind, lets his name be associated with it! (By way of preface to D. B. Kalelkar’slibtech_518_footnoteGospel of Swadeshi.) Coming from an ardent admirer of yours, this indeed calls for an answer from you. I notice in the November 27 issue of Young India, you append a note at the foot of Mr. Andrews’ article entitled “Truth about Nationalism”, which purports to state that Indian swadeshi cannot become impure or racial. Will you not stretch the argument further in a subsequent issue and allay the fears of the author of this wonderful book and its innumerable readers?
So far as D. B. Kalelkar’s pamphlet is concerned, the position is
  	this. It is a rendering of a Gujarati pamphlet. My preface was to 	the original. D. B. Kalelkar is a valued associate. I therefore 	wrote the half dozen lines of preface also in Gujarati without 	studying the pamphlet.  I had only glanced at passages here and 	there. I knew my friend’s views on swadeshi. I had no difficulty 	about identifying myself with them. But at the instance of Mr. 	Andrews, I have read the translation and I confess that the 	presentment is narrow in places. I  have  discussed them with Mr. 	Kalelkar too and he agrees that they do read narrow in the 	translation for which he is not responsible. So far as my own views 	are concerned, my writings in Young India make it quite plain 	that my swadeshi, and for that matter Mr. Kalelkar’s, is not as 	narrow as the pamphlet would lead one to suppose. So 	much for the pamphlet itself.  	My definition of swadeshi is well known. I must not serve distant 	neighbour at the expense of the nearest. It is never vindic- tive or 	punitive.  It  is  in  no  sense  narrow,  for  I  buy  from  every 	part of the world what is needed for my growth. I refuse to  buy  	from anybody anything however nice or beautiful if it interferes     
 with my growth or injures those whom Nature has made my first care.  I buy useful healthy literature from every part of the world. I buy surgical instruments from England, pins and pencils from Austria and watches from Switzerland. But I will not buy an inch of the finest cotton fabric from England or Japan or any other part of the world because it has injured and increasingly injures the millions of the inhabitants of India. I hold it to be sinful for me [not] to buy the cloth spun and woven by the needy millions of India’s paupers and to buy foreign cloth, although it may be superior in quality to the Indian hand-spun. My swadeshi therefore chiefly centres round the hand- spun khaddar and extends to every thing that can be and is produced in India. My nationalism is as broad as my swadeshi. I want India’s rise so that the whole world may benefit. I do not want India to rise on the ruin of other nations. If therefore India was strong and able, India would send out to the world her treasures of art and health-giving spices, but will refuse to send out opium or intoxicating liquors although the traffic may bring much material benefit to India.

   BIRTH-CONTROL  
 It is not without the greatest hesitation and reluctance that I approach the subject. The question of using artificial methods for birth- control has been referred to me by correspondents ever since my return to India. Though I have answered them personally, I have never hitherto dealt with the subject publicly. My attention was drawn to the subject, now thirty-five years ago, when I was a student in England. There was then a hot controversy raging between a purist who would not countenance anything but natural means and a doctor who advocated artificial means. It was at that early time in my life that I became, after leanings for a brief period towards artificial means, a convinced opponent of them. I now observe that in some Hindi papers the methods are described in a revoltingly open manner which shocks one’s sense of decency. I observe, too, that one writer  does  not hesitate to cite my name as among the supporters of artificial methods of birth-control. I cannot recall a single occasion when I spoke or wrote in favour of such methods. I have seen also two distinguished names having been used in support. I hesitate to publish them without reference to their owners.
There can be no two opinions about the necessity of birth-
 
 control. But the only method handed down from ages past is self- control or brahmacharya. It is an infallible sovereign remedy doing good to those who practise it. And medical men will earn the gratitude of mankind, if instead of devising artificial means of birth-control they will find out the means of self-control. The union is meant not for pleasure but for bringing forth progeny. And union is a crime when the desire for progeny is absent.
 Artificial methods are like putting a premium upon vice. They make men and women reckless. And respectability that is being given to the methods must hasten the dissolution of the restraints that public opinion puts upon one. Adoption of artificial methods must result in imbecility and nervous prostration. The remedy will be found to be worse than the disease. It is wrong and immoral to seek to escape the consequences of one’s acts. It is good for a person who overeats to have an ache and a fast. It is bad for him to indulge his appetite and then escape the consequence by taking tonics or other medicine. It is still worse for a person to indulge in his animal passions and escape the consequences of his acts. Nature is relentless and will have full revenge for any such violation of her laws. Moral results can only be produced by moral restraints. All other restraints defeat the very purpose for which they are intended. The reasoning underlying the use of artificial methods is that indulgence is a necessity of life. Nothing can be more fallacious. Let those who are eager to see the births regulated explore the lawful means devised by the ancients and try to find out how they can be revived. An enormous amount of spade-work lies in front of them. Early marriages are fruitful source of adding to the population. The present mode of life has also a great deal to do with the evil of unchecked procreation. If these causes are investigated and dealt with, society will be morally elevated. If they are ignored by impatient zealots and if artificial methods become the order of the day, nothing but moral degradation can be the result. A society that has already become enervated through a variety of causes will become still further enervated by the adoption of artificial methods. Those men therefore who are light-heartedly advocating artificial methods cannot do better than study the subject afresh, stay their injurious activity and popularize brahmacharya both for the married and the unmarried. That is the only noble and  straight  method of birth-control.

   NOTES  
 LATEST FIGURES
 Further figures reported since last week from Gujarat and through a telegram from Pandit Jawaharlal from Allahabad bring the total of membership to 7,851. The figure reported last  week  was 6,644. So far only five provinces show an advance on their position as it stood last week. The revised figures of these provinces are as follows:
A	B	TOTAL
1.	Gujarat	1847	80	1927
2.	U.P.	129	254	1094
 (including unclassified figures)
3.	Bihar	418	146	737 (do)
 Maharashtra	48	123	171 
 
   Sind	Details	not 		furnished  168 
  	6.	Burma	26	3	29    	The last named Province is one of the six Provinces from whom no 	report has been received on the 1st of March. The other five, i.e., 	Tamilnad, Kerala, Delhi, Assam and North-Western Provinces still 	remain unrepresented in the grand total given above.  	As had been foreshadowed in the previous report the larger number of 	provinces have not yet been able to cope with the task of collecting 	district figures. It is hoped that full classified figures will be 	communicated to Young India office next week. Messages should 	not reach us later than Wednesday morning.  MEMBERSHIP 	RETURNS  	The figures, published last week, of membership leave a great deal 	to be desired. Six Provinces have not sent in any returns at all. Of 	those that have, many have not even taken the trouble of giving the 	clas-sification. One had hoped, from the letter I published some 	weeks ago, that Berar will at least make a brave show at least in 	yarn-giving mem-bers. But I am sorry it stands at the bottom of the 	list. Ajmer could, if it wished, easily give one thousand 	self-spinners. It has begun with only two self- spinners against 	fifteen yarn givers. I expect 
 Bengal, Andhra, Karnatak and Bihar and Tamilnad which have well- equipped spinning centres, to beat Gujarat if only because they have a much larger population than Gujarat. They have moreover spinning traditions whose memory still lingers in the present generation.
 THE RS. 1,000 PRIZE
 I observe that several youngmen are making an earnest effort to win Mr. Revashanker’s prize. Some of the essays promise to be brilliantly written. These competitors will be glad to learn that Mr. Ambalal Sarabhai has agreed to join the examining board. I  am looking forward to worthy contributions to the growing literature on the subject.
 SPINNERS’ YARN
 A District Congress Secretary writes to say that some spinners have grown so fond of spinning that they are anxious to purchase their own yarn and get it woven into cloth for personal use. He asks whether those who have sent their yarn as Congress subscription may buy their own yarn for the purpose mentioned. The ideal is undoubtedly for people during the leisure hours to spin enough for their own clothing. It is the easiest and the best method of India becoming self-supporting for her cloth. I would therefore advise all secretaries to encourage the idea of spinners buying their own yarn on the understanding that they do not use it for paying the subscription again.
 SOME STRIKING FIGURES
 A lover of khaddar has handed me the following condensation of figures to prove how easy it is to make India self-supporting for her cloth, if only the people could be induced to shake off their laziness and work the charkha and to wear khaddar garments:libtech_519_footnote
 NO STONING IN KORAN
 I gladly publish the following telegram from Dr. Mahomed Ali, President, Ahmadiya Anjuman Ishaat-i-Islam:
 The Koran enjoins no such punishment as stoning for any offence whatever. Your note is unfair to Islam and her Prophet and liable to
 
 tremendously prejudice the world against Islam. I am sure this is not your considered opinion and is based on hearsay. A reference to my English translation of Koran on the points concerned will convince you that your informants are in error. Pray consider and refute.
Dr. Mahomed Ali has misunderstood my criticism. I knew that
 stoning to death had been defended by some as a penalty described by the Koran in certain circumstances. Without stating my opinion as to whether such a penalty had or had not been prescribed in the  Koran or the traditions, I simply said that it could not be defended even on the authority of the Holy Koran. I am glad that Dr. Mahomed Ali assures me that “the Koran enjoins no such punish-ment as stoning”. I would like to know on what ground it has been defended at Kabul and the defence upheld in India by a section of Mussalmans. I would like to see a unanimous condemnation by Mussalmans of stoning as a form of penalty. If it could be had it would make a repetition of the penalty impossible in any part of the Islamic world.
 A TYPICAL LETTER
 A well-known Indian public worker once wrote to a well-known Englishman a letter asking for an interview. Here is a characteristic reply sent by the Englishman:
 In reply to your letter I regret that I cannot see you for the simple reason that, in my opinion, no benefit could be derived by you from an interview with me in the present state of the Indian question. I can neither understand nor sympathize with the action and purpose of the leaders of  the  Indian community. Your people must surely understand something of the nature of the race of men with whom they are dealing. Much has been given you by the British Government. Can you not put to its full use that which has been given  in the spirit of justice? It is possible for your people, by high organization of their voting power and by the careful selection and continual criticism of their best men, to prove over a series of years that they are capable of exercising the highest duties and fulfilling the most exacting responsibilities of citizenship. I am sure that in giving this proof of political capacity you would carry with you for future political evolution, the best minds and the most effective sympathies of my countrymen. If you place your trust in political bargains among English parties, you can but be disappointed by results.
It is difficult to choose whether to deplore the insolence of the
 letter or to admire the sincerity of the writer’s convictions. He had made up his mind that he had nothing to learn from the would-be visitor. He had only to give. Who can satisfy this Englishman who keeps himself locked up in a safe and refuses to see that no amount of
 argumentative powers can possibly fit us for the “exacting respon- sibility of citizenship”? Who can prove to such an Englishman that the responsibilities of citizenship require the primary capacity for self- defence and that this cannot be acquired by learning the art of debating? Who can show to him that his own race learnt the art of self- government by developing the capacity for defending its country and that such debating power as it has learnt came to it only after the English people began to have self-government? Who can show to this writer and his like that we Indians think not that much has been given us in the spirit of justice, but that so little has been given to us, and that too by force of circumstances? Lastly, who can show him that we put our trust not in “political bargaining among English parties but in our own strength?” This ignorance of Englishmen and their attitude of studied isolation is truly deplorable. The letter, however, teaches us a lesson. We must not court insult by asking for interviews with those we do not know. Our own conduct will right our relations with the whole world.
 A WORKER IMPRISONED
 I have a telegram from Cochin saying that Sjt. Kurur Nambudiripad has been sentenced to two months’ simple impris- onment. I do not know the cause of imprisonment. Sjt. Nambu-  diripad is a seasoned soldier and staunch worker. I congratulate him on his imprisonment. In my opinion he also serves who is imprisoned in the act of service and without any moral lapse.
 A POLITICIAN?
 Mr. Andrews sends me for answer a letter he has received from an English friend. This is the friend’s puzzle:
 I was surprised to read in a recent article Gandhi’s repudiation of intermarriage between touchables and untouchables. That seems to me the test question. Not that I would have him advocate marriage between any particular caste and any other, any more than between any person and any other person. But surely the right marital relations, and the right children, are found whenever man and wife are of one mind, in the fullest sense. And is that not Gandhi’s aim in India? In proportion as it is  reached,  will  not intermarriage between castes not become as natural as in Ephesus was intermarriage between Jew and Greek?
 I know Gandhi is a politician and I can guess he wrote the words to avoid offence. But surely the political price of such a statement is sure to be fatally injurious to his central aim? How can he expect the European farmer in Kenya to treat the Indian shopkeeper as he should, if Brahmins are to deny equal
 privileges to sweepers on the sole ground of caste?
 I have repeatedly expressed my view of caste and intermarriage. With me marriage is no necessary test of friendship even between husband and wife, let alone their respective clans. I cannot picture to myself a time when all mankind will have one religion. As a rule there will, therefore, be the religious bar. People will marry in their own religion. Similarly there will persist the territorial restriction. The caste restriction is an extension of the same principle. It is a social convenience. An English nobleman’s son does not, as a rule, marry a grocer’s daughter. She would, as a rule, be rejected  on  the  sole ground of her birth. I am opposed to untouchability because it limits the field of service. Marriage is not an act of service. It is a comfort man or woman seeks for him or herself. And I see no harm in restricting the circle of comfort or being selective in regard to such a life-change as marriage. If a Kenya settler will not tolerate my  presence in Kenya because I will not give my daughter in marriage to him or receive his for my son I should be sorry for him but would content myself with exclusion from Kenya rather than be compelled to contract an incompatible tie. I would only add that the Kenya settler would not permit me even to think of any such relation. And if  I put forth any such claim it would be regarded as an additional reason for excluding me from his preserve. Though the point is absolutely clear as it seems to me and though marriage is restricted in practice all over the world to classes, clans, etc., Mr. Andrews’ correspondent is not likely to be satisfied with my answer. But I can give him the assurance that I have not evaded the issue for fear of giving offence. I am not a politician in the narrow sense given to the word by the correspondent. I have written as I have believed. I have sacrificed no principle to gain a political advantage. Probably I would gain greater reputation in the circles I move in, if I did not accept the Hindu restraint on intermarriage. And what is my central aim? It is equal treatment for the whole of humanity and that equal treatment means equality of service. The duty of service may be denied to none. The privilege of marriage presupposes temperamental and other affinity. It would be no crime for a woman to reject the hand of a red- haired man but she would be guilty of a gross sin if she neglected the duty of serving him because of his red hair. Marriage is a matter of choice. Service is an obligation that cannot be shirked.
 TO ANOTHER REVOLUTIONARY
I am afraid your advice to me to retire from public life is not so
 easy to follow as it is to give. I claim to be servant of India and there through of humanity. I cannot always have it my own way. If I have had my share of fair weather I must face the foul too. I must not abandon the field of battle so long as I feel that I am wanted. When my work is done and I have become a disabled or worn-out soldier, I shall be put away. Till then I must continue to do my work and endeavour to neutralize in all the ways accessible to me the poison of the revolutionary activity. A well-meaning and self-sacrificing physi- cian who prescribes arsenic when he should have given fresh grape juice is one to be shunned in spite of his good intentions and even sacrifice. I invite the revolutionaries not to commit suicide and drag with them unwilling victims. India’s way is not Europe’s. India is not Calcutta and Bombay. India lives in her seven hundred thousand villages. If the revolutionaries are as many let them spread out into these villages and try to bring sunshine into the dark dungeons of the millions of their countrymen. That would be worthier of their ambition and love of the land than the exciting and unquenchable thirst for the blood of English officials and those who are assisting them. It is nobler to try to change their spirit than to take their lives.
 HINDU AGGRESSION
 A Mussalman correspondent takes me gently to task for my article dealing with the alleged building of mosques on private property, and then quotes unsupported instances of alleged Hindu aggression. He, however, supports one statement with facts. I have invited him to support his other statements and have promised full publication and even investigation in the event of his so supporting them. Meanwhile, I give below the only statement made and supported by my correspondent:
 The Moslems of Lohani want to substitute a pucka structure for an old cutcha mosque. The Hindu might won’t let the Moslem right prevail. Our brethren are using the same weapons of boycott against the  rightful countrymen which they were taught to use against foreign aggression. Prayers and call to prayers are all stopped.
 If the Hindus of Lohani have done what is imputed to them, they are certainly guilty of aggression. I invite them to send me their version for publication and set the matter right without delay, if the allegations made against them are right. Those who seek justice must come with clean hands.

 238. THE LOWLANDS OF KENYAlibtech_520_footnote
 After a recent visit to Delhi, I feel it to be of the utmost importance to make plain, beyond any shadow of misunderstanding, how emphatically I should object to anyone being sent out from India officially to investigate an area in the Lowlands of Kenya in which large free grants of Crown lands should be given to Indians for colonization purposes.
 In the first place, to accept even tentatively such an offer, or even to examine it with a view to approval, is to stultify the whole Indian position. For the Indian claim is not to receive free grants of Crown lands anywhere, but to recover the legal rights of sale and purchase of land in the Highlands which have been illegally taken away after a solemn promise had been made that they should remain intact. Indians are asking for an  elementary  right  of citizenship. They are asking to be placed on a basis of equality with other citizens in the eyes of the law. It, therefore, can easily be seen, that if Indians even examine the proposal that they should be given grants in the Lowlands, it will be certainly understood as their final abandonment of legal rights elsewhere. I do not think that it can be made too plain, that the very act of sending an Indian official to examine an area in the Lowlands  will  be interpreted as a giving up of Indian legal rights in the Highlands altogether.
 In the second place, for Indians to use the British military force to take possession of a large area in the Lowlands, thus depriving the natives of still further territory, in addition to the 12,000 square miles of fertile soil that has been taken from them in the Highlands by the whites, is to commit an injustice. It means that India, for the first time, by a definite act is prepared to enter upon a policy of imperial “grab”, wherever an opportunity occurs. That the African Natives, as far as they have any voice or power, will most  strongly object to any such policy of “grab”, on the part of India, goes without saying. If they are voiceless and powerless, then the wrong done to them will be all the greater. It must be remembered that Kenya is not an empty country, with no Native inhabitants. It is a large territory, with only a very small fraction of good, well-watered agricultural land. If it had not been for the labour exploitation that has been going on, with its inevitable demoralization, the Native population would already have spread over the cultivable soil and occupied it. Even today, in spite of the exploitation that has taken place, the Native “reserves” are already proving too small. It would be an act of grave injustice, therefore, if Indians were to seize, under the cover of British and Indian bayonets, a great slice of the territory still remaining open for Native occupation.
 
 In the third place, the Indian claim to free immigration into Kenya and Uganda is based entirely on the ground that Indians are helping and not hindering the Native advancement. There is no other claim than this. What is put forward is this, that for two thousand years the trade between East Africa and India has gone on. Indians have come freely to East Africa and have been hospitably received because they came in peace and not for war; because the trade and the barter that they brought with them was mutually beneficial. East Aricans have, from this side, been able to come freely to India in the same manner. They have been hospitably received for the same reason. Thus free emigration on both sides has been encouraged and has prevailed. But if an entirely new relationship is advocated—the relationship (however decently veiled) of conquest and possession,—the whole aspect changes. The Indian claim, to respect the Native and to benefit the Native, falls to the ground. Indians become imperialistic invaders of Africa and are classed as such in the same category with the Europeans. Though feeling  the  iron yoke of subjection themselves, they are ready to bring others into subjection. They do not any longer stand out on the side of the oppressed, but themselves take the side of the oppressors and their own share of the spoils. Any such    action on  the part of responsible Indians, on such a large scale as is now contemplated, is to me unthinkable.
I entirely endorse Mr. Andrews’ view that it would be wrong in
 every way to countenance the idea of Indians being excluded from the highlands and restricted to the lowlands especially if it is true that the lowlands have to be stolen from the native of the soil.

239. TO M. V. N.
 I draw a sharp distinction between untouchability and varna or caste. The former has no scientific basis. It cannot be supported by reason. It denies man the privilege of service to fellow beings and deprives the “untouchables” in distress of the right of receiving service from their kind. The caste system has in my opinion a scien- tific basis. Reason does not revolt against it. If it has disadvantages, it has also its advantages. It does not prevent a Brahmin from serving his Sudra brother. Caste creates a social and moral restraint. The doctrine of caste cannot be extended. I would restrict it to four divisions. Any multiplication would be an evil. I would reform the castes and rid them of undoubted abuses but I can find no reason for their abolition. For me there is no question of superiority or inferiority. A Brahmin who regards himself as a superior being born to look down upon the
 other castes is not a Brahmin. If he is first he is so by right of service.

   TO R.S.S.R.  
 You have not given your address. If, in your opinion, the Gita advocates violence in the other chapters, the verses you quote from the 12th do not take us much further along non-violence. But I do not agree with you that the Gita advocates and teaches violence in any part of it. See the concluding discourse at the end of Chapter II. Although that chapter lends itself to a violent interpretation, the concluding verses seem to me to preclude any such interpretation. The fact is that a literal interpretation of the Gita lands one in a sea of contradictions. The letter truly killeth, the spirit giveth life.

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO MUNICIPAL 		ADDRESS, QUILON  
 March 12, 1925
MR. PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL AND FRIENDS,
 I thank you sincerely for the beautiful address that you have given to me and the sentiments that you have expressed therein. I know that you regret, as I regret, the absence of my friend Maulana Shaukat Ali, who as a rule accompanied me in all such tours. As it so happened, it was not possible for him to tear himself away from the special engagements that have kept him in Delhi, nor was it really necessary for him to accompany me during this tour. As you are aware, I have for the time being a special mission in Travancore in which he is not so interested as we Hindus are.
The question of untouchability expresses itself in all its evil
 
 form in Malabar. I must confess to you that before the struggle started in Vykom, I never knew that approachability was a crime. Travancore is one of the few favoured places in India where education seems to be almost universal. You are in  a  State  which  is  considered—and I think rightly considered—to be progressive. This State, I know, has done a great deal  for  what  are  miscalled  the  depressed  classes.  I say the depressed classes miscalled, because the proper term is sup- pressed classes. It was  Swami  Vivekanandalibtech_522_footnotelibtech_523_footnotewho  reminded  us  that the upper classes had suppressed a portion of themselves, and had thereby been depressed themselves.  You  cannot  lower  the  mem- bers of your own species without lowering yourselves. It surpasses comprehension that any human being should be prohibited from making use of roads which are semi-public or altogether public. Ever since I have entered Travancore, I have been patiently and courteously listening to the arguments that can possibly be advanced in favour of such a prohibition but I must confess to you that I remain totally unconvinced, not because I am not open to conviction, but because there seems to me to be something inherently wrong in the very opposition that is taken up by the orthodox people.
 I have made to them three definite offers. I will not discuss them at the present moment, but I ask you all who are assembled here to give me and give the cause your sympathy and co-operation in an active manner. (Cheers.) And that co-operation and sympathy I ask of every man and woman in this city if you are convinced with me of the error that has crept into Hinduism. Pray remember that  all  the religions of the world are at present in the melting pot. They may not support themselves upon mere scriptural authority. They will have to stand the severest test of reason and, sanatana dharma Hindu that I claim myself to be, I do not hesitate to repeat what I have said on many an occasion that if I find that there were any texts in the Vedas or Puranas that were inconsistent with reason, I would have no hesitation in rejecting them, but all the researches that the limited time and the limited knowledge have enabled me to make personally and all the assistance that I have received from the most learned Shastris that are to be found in India have convinced me that  there  is absolutely no warrant for unapproachability or even untouchability as they are being practised today in India in our Shastras. This is a land
 
 of learning and if you desire to controvert the statement that I have made I invite you to give me your assistance and give me the verses that in your opinion may support the contention of the orthodox. I assure you that if we do not wake betimes—I am speaking to the Hindu part of this audience—our religion is in danger of perishing.
 I am asked to be patient in connection  with  this  reform.  I  know from experience that patience is a virtue. I have in my own humble manner cultivated that virtue for the past 40 years with the greatest deliberation, but I must confess to you that I can no longer remain patient with the curse that blots  Hinduism.  I  ask  you  to regard impatience with this curse a virtue. Mark my words, I do not say impatience with the orthodox people, but I ask you to be impatient with yourselves. Do not rest satisfied till you have rid the land of this curse and you will tear down the opposition of blind orthodoxy if you bestir yourself and express your own opinion with emphasis, and satyagraha is nothing but an emphatic expression of one’s own opinion. Emphasis is not required in the speech, it is required in the action and emphasis of action means suffering in  one’s own person. I ask you in the light of this test critically to study the movement that is going on at Vykom and if you find in the satyagrahis there the slightest trace of violence, denounce them in unmeasured terms, but if you find that they are a set of honest people acting in defiance of the opinion of the orthodoxy of Vykom, but patiently enduring what becomes their lot, if you find that what I am telling you about these men is true, I ask you to support them.
 Satyagraha is a force that has come to stay. No force in the world can kill it. It is a priceless possession. It blesses those who practise it and it blesses those in connection with whom it is practised. No one need fear it, and I wish that you, the educated people of this place, will study the method of satyagraha with all its implications and you will admit with me that it is a method which is matchless, if it is properly understood and practised.
 I was delighted to see in the address of the Dewan of Travancore a reference to the spinning-wheel. You have passed in the Assembly a resolution recommending the adoption of the spinning-wheel in the national schools. I congratulate the Assembly upon the resolution, but as I passed through the towns or the cities of Travancore, I must confess to you that I have my misgivings about the success of the introduction of the spinning-wheel in your schools. If I remember rightly, the Dewan has advertised for an expert spinner. I wonder
 whether it will be possible to get a single expert spinner in Travancore and if you have not sufficient expert spinners, I do not see how it will be possible for you to man your schools with spinning teachers, but having passed the resolution, I ask you to make of that resolution a success. Believe me, the spinning-wheel and the spinning-wheel alone will solve, if anything will solve, the problem of the deepening poverty of India. You want a universal supplementary occupation for the agricultural classes of India. Such an occupation has to be supplemented only by the spinning-wheel, nor is it a new t hing. Only  a hundred years ago every cottage of India had a spinning-wheel. Restore the spinning-wheel to its place and you will solve the problem of poverty.
 I have  fallen  in  love  with  the  women  of Travancore. They do not need the inordinate  lengths  that  the  women  of  the  Tamil  land require. I am glad that the women of Travancore consi-der themselves sufficiently elegant if their limbs and bodies are covered. Their white dress has captivated me. I hope and believe that it is a symbol and emblem of the purity within, (Cheers.) but I am distressed to find that they wear the calico of Manchester or even the calico of Ahmedabad. I ask them to copy their sisters of Assam. Every woman in Assam knows how to weave, and almost every household in Assam even at the present moment has a handloom. I ask every one of you, man and woman, to clothe yourselves in khaddar, hand-spun and hand-woven. You will thereby place yourselves in direct touch with the poorest of the land and if you will kindly adopt the advice that I have humbly ventured to tender to you, you will find that this will be a land of plenty.

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO “EZHAVAS ‘” ADDRESS, VARKALAIlibtech_524_footnote  
 March 13, 1925
 I am deeply grateful to you for the address  that  you  have  kindly presented to me. Needless to say, I was looking forward to this visit. I wanted  to  know  who  were  the  different communities that were barred entrance to roads that are public or semi-public in
 
 Vykom and it has, therefore, been a matter of study, to come here and make your acquaintance personally. I have now a demonstration of what is in store for His Holiness, if he went to Vykom and tried to cross the barrier.
 As you are aware, I was to have waited upon Her Highness the Maharani Regent, and similarly, I was to have waited upon His  Holiness (Swami Narayana Guru), both  of  which  I  did  yesterday, and feel highly flattered that I was able to wait upon these high personages. I am able to tell you  that  Her  Highness’s  sympathies, so far as she herself is personally concerned, are entirely with those who are trying to seek redress. I am free to tell you that she considers that the roads at Vykom and similar roads elsewhere should be open to all classes, (Cheers.) but as the head of the State, she feels powerless, unless there is public opinion behind her, and unless, therefore, public opinion in Travancore is organized in a perfectly legitimate, peaceful and constitutional manner, and unless that opinion is expressed in an equally constitutional, legitimate and peaceful manner, though ever so emphatic, she will feel powerless to grant the relief desired. I, for my part, entirely accept that position. It is for you and me to break down the opposition of blind orthodoxy. You will not feel the glow of freedom and liberty, unless you yourselves take a leading part in breaking down that opposition.
 The orthodox friends whom I saw flung in my face, and rightly, the law of karma. The paraphrase that I would give of the law of karma is that everyone gets what he deserves, and we deserve what we have inherited. Hinduism believes in heredity, and so do the scientists, and Hinduism is a science reduced to practice, but that very science, that very Hinduism also teaches us to undo the law of karma and that undoing is done by doing more karma of an opposite character. If, in my past incarnation, I did something that was wrong, it is possible for me to undo the result of that evil past by doing something which is contrary to the evil, and even as it is possible for us to do better than our past, it is possible for this blindly orthodox people now to heap bad karma upon bad karma, and earn a reward which they would not like. The law of karma is no respector of persons, but I would ask you to leave the orthodoxy to itself. Man is the maker of his own destiny, and I therefore ask you to become makers of your own destiny. I am myself trying to become a bridge between my blind orthodoxy and those who are victims of that orthodoxy,  and,  therefore, in so far as it is possible for me, I am trying to become one
 of yourselves, and then, as I was telling His Holiness this morning, I described myself as a scavenger—Bhangi—and Bhangi occupies the lowest rung of the ladder among suppressed classes. I am not ashamed to call myself a Bhangi, and I ask every Bhangi not to be ashamed of his calling. A Bhangi, if he is true to his salt, is  a  sanitarian.  I described myself also as a weaver, spinner and farmer. The suppressed classes, the orthodox say, should remain suppressed because of the vices which, they say, are inherent in them. It is for you and me to show that no vice is inherent in man. That which is inherent in man is his virtue. Immediately he realizes his own potentialities, man becomes almost divine, and I would like every one of us to become what he should be, and not remain what we are.
 It gives me pleasure to find amongst you so many educated men and women; to find lawyers, doctors  and  other  professional men. But I  must confess to you  that  I  am  not  satisfied  with  that. It is good, but it is not good enough. What will tell in the end will be character and not a knowledge of letters. I would, therefore, ask you to cultivate the best in yourselves, and you will find that no strength, however invincible it may appear to be, can stand against the inherent strength you would have developed in yourselves. There are instances innumerable throughout the length and breadth of India, or people belonging to suppressed classes, having not only come into their own, but of having commanded reverence from the highest among Brah- mins, and I want you to do nothing less than those distinguished men have done before you. I ask you to regard yourselves as trustees for the welfare of Hinduism. I know that there is at the present moment a wave of impatience going round the country, not only through Travancore, but throughout the length and breadth of India, amongst the suppressed classes. I assure you that it is wrong. You cannot achieve durable reform by becoming impatient. If we must be impatient, we must be impatient with ourselves, and not impatient with the wrongdoer. I have presented India with the same prescription in connection with the conduct of Englishmen towards us, and I have no other in connection with the conduct of orthodoxy towards us. And if every vice that is attributed to us is eradicated, you will find that orthodoxy has absolutely no bottom left to itself. You will say, and very properly, what can virtue and character have to do with entrance to a public road, but I want you to look beneath the surface. There is, in the mind of orthodoxy, religion mixed up inextricably with the use of certain public roads.
 The position that is taken up by orthodoxy is wrong, unsound, immoral and sinful, but that is my viewpoint, that is your viewpoint, not that of orthodoxy. There was a time when our ancestors offered human sacrifice. We know that it was diabolical, that it was irreligion, but not so thought our ancestors. They knew no better and they had made of vice a virtue. And we would be doing them grave injustice if we do judge them by the standard of today. If we are to judge them rightly, it is necessary for us to step into their shoes and see how they would have felt, and they did feel when human sacrifice was abo- lished. This is not in justification for the past deeds, but it is a circumstance which is in favour of our ancestors, that they knew no better, and so would I have you to judge the blindly orthodox people of our own times. They know no better, and I tell you, I am speak-ing from bitter experience. I am speaking, that is to say, of experience in my own domestic life. I have not yet been able to remove the wall of prejudice that surrounds my own dear wife and I be impatient with her. I must carry her with me by showing to her the greatest consideration, the greatest courtesy and greater affection still, if it were possible for me to do so. While I remain absolutely strict  with reference to my own conduct, while I must become impatient of any wrong, the slightest that may be lurking in me, I must be generous towards her. You will not expect me to do otherwise. Then similarly I expect you not to feel otherwise towards the orthodox people, and that is the secret of a true religious life. Swamiji told me yesterday, religion was one. I combated that view, and I combat it here this morning. So long as there are different human heads, so long will there be different religions, but the secret of a true religious life is to tolerate one another’s religion. What may appear evil to us in certain religious practices is not necessarily evil to those who follow those practices. I cannot, I dare not, blind myself to existing differences. I cannot rub them off the slate, if I would, but knowing those differences, I must love even those who differ from me. You will find an exemplification of this law throughout the world. No two leaves of this very tree, under whose shadow we are sitting, are alike, though they spring from the same root, but, even as the leaves live together in perfect harmony and present to us a beautiful whole, so must we, divided humanity present to the outsider looking upon us a beautiful whole. That can be done when we begin to love each other and tolerate each other in spite of  differences. So, although I see the deep ignorance, the black ignorance of blind orthodoxy, I refuse to be impatient with that
 orthodoxy, and hence I present to the world the law of non-violence and I say that a man who wants to lead a religious life on this earth and a man who wants to realize himself on this earth  in  this incarnation must remain non-violent in every shape and form and in every one of his actions. And I am here to tell you that, had this Vykom satyagraha been carried on in that absolutely non-violent spirit and had that campaign received that support from you which it should have received, the battle would have closed long ago. I have given my need of praise to the satyagrahis of Vykom. They have done well. They have commanded my admiration, but that was only one side of the picture. I would be untrue to you if I did not present to you the other side of the picture but there again, applying the same law of non-violence, I refuse to condemn them. They have done their best, but I ask them and I ask you to do  better.  They  have done no physical violence to anybody, but their thoughts and their minds were not non-violent. I discovered that even during my discussion with them. They feel bitter towards the orthodox people who are putting up this opposition. They are angry with them and they distrust their motives. They distrust the motives of the Government. I say that all these things are beneath the dignity of satyagraha. I will take the Government at its word. I believe the orthodox when they say that it does violence to their religious sentiment when I pass through their road and, by giving them the same credit for honesty which I would claim for myself, I disarm their suspicion and opposition. I place myself in a most favourable position by insinuating myself in their esteem and thereby expect to open the eyes of their understanding. I want you to take up that  attitude mentally, because I believe that thoughts are infinitely more powerful than deeds. Deeds are indifferent caricatures of our thoug-hts, and a student of psychology has no difficulty in analysing the deeds and tracing them to their sources, and finding out how noble and mainly a man is and often times how equally degraded he is.
 My object today is to reiterate the main principles, that we must attain our own salvation, we must be self-reliant, we must exert ourselves and I ask you to set aside every other task that may be before you and apply yourselves to the finishing of this particular satyagraha. It is a test case and the way for you to do it is to feed this noble band of satyagrahis and to feed them in every sense of this term. You must be ashamed of receiving money from me or from any other person outside this province, if it were possible even outside
 Vykom. You must not only find this physical food for them but you must also dedicate yourselves to the cause, and never allow the  ceaseless flow of satyagrahis to dry up. You must not be satisfied with a few young men, brave lads, day in and day out sitting in and  spinning away in that fierce sun before the barricades, but you must take your due share in the cause, you must also perform tapas-charya by being baked in the sun, and what is more, since sacrifice is a sacred thing, you must approach this task with a sacred heart. Your character must therefore be above suspicion and you must be truthful and self- controlled. You must not indulge in luxuries for the time being at any rate, you must cut your necessaries down to the lowest point, you must cut yourselves off from every worldly tie for the time being; having taken leave of your elders, you must not turn your back towards them. They may not expect you to help them even in time of their need, once you have gone from them. Try to do this in reality and you will find for yourselves that you have carved a status which no power on earth can deprive you of; all cannot have the privilege of doing this special work, but all of you can do social amelioration work among the community. There is the drink evil, you must tackle that evil. I do not sufficiently know the other evil habits that may be prevalent in your community. But you must remove untouchability from amongst yourselves. You must go out to those among the suppressed classes who are still lower down in the scale, befriend them and help them in every manner possible.
 Take up the gospel of spinning and khaddar. I have urged His Holiness to take up this thing in right earnest and ask everyone of you to take to spinning and weaving and wear the product of your own labour. I understand that not very long ago everyone of you or at least every woman in your community was a beautiful spinner. Thousands upon thousands knew how to weave. Both are noble callings. In spinning alone lies the economic salvation of India, I am convinced. Individually spinning, I admit, is not a profitable occupa- tion; nationally it is one of the most noble and the most profitable of occupations. Hence I have called spinning the yajna of this age for India. I was gladdened beyond measure when His Holiness told me that he would spin himself (Cheers.) and he has given  me  his assurance that henceforth he is going to ask everyone of his devoted disciples not to appear in his presence unless he is clad in spotless khaddar. I expect all the educated men among you to feel  the  privilege of spinning and the privilege of wearing khaddar. I expect
 you to go amongst your women folk and ask them to do likewise. You do not go in for the heavy saris that the Tamil sisters wear in the Madras Presidency. You do not go in for variety and colour. I am charmed with the spotless white dress of your women. A few yards of cloth suffices for the wants of men and women. You must regard it as a matter of shame and humiliation and degradation that you should have to fall back upon Manchester or Ahmedabad calico. If you would attend to these things, that would be your contribution to the national cause or to the cause of satyagraha at Vykom. Do not be frightened that it is a long-drawn-out battle. His Holiness told me yesterday that we might not see the end of this agony during our life time, in this generation, and that I should have to wait for another incarnation of mine before I had the pleasure of seeing the end of this agony. I respectfully differed from him. I hope to see the end in this very age during my lifetime, but I do not hope to do so without your assistance. Assist me to the full measure of your ability to show to you that this wrong becomes a thing of the past. Do your duty manfull and I undertake to show to you that this fifth class from Hinduism entirely eradicated. (Cheers.) May God grant the necessary strength and determination to His Holiness to infect you with a proper understanding and may God grant you the wisdom and the strength to carry out this sacred task.
 I tender my thanks publicly to His Holiness for the extreme kindness that he has shown to me and the hospitality that he has extended to me. I thank you once more for the address that you have presented to me and for the patience with which you have listened to me, but the best reward that I ask you to give me, I expect, is the translation of what you have listened to in action (Loud and continued cheers.)

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO STUDENTS’ 		ADDRESS, TRIVANDRUMlibtech_525_footnote  
 March 13, 1925
 It is a common superstition in India, and more so outside India—because,   that   is  what  I   find   from   my   correspondence in
 
 Europe and America—that I am an opponent, a foe, of science. Nothing can be farther from truth than a charge of this character. It is perfectly true, however, that I am not an admirer of science unmixed with something that I am about to say to you. I think that we cannot live without science, if we keep it in its right place. But I have learnt so much during my wanderings in the world about the misuse of science that I have often remarked, or made such remarks, as would lead people to consider that I was really an opponent of science. In my humble opinion there are limitations even to scientific search, and the limitations that I place upon scientific search are the limitations that humanity imposes upon us. I was only the other day discussing with a friend on the uses of science, and at that time I told him a story of my life which I propose to repeat to you. I told him that there was a time in my life when I very nearly went in for medicine and I told him also that had I gone in for it, probably, I would have become a celebrated physician or a celebrated surgeon or both; because, really I am a lover of both these branches and I feel that I could have rendered a great deal of service in that department. But when I understood from a medical friend–and he was a distinguished doctor—that I would have to practise vivisection I recoiled with horror from it.libtech_526_footnote
 Probably, some of you will laugh at my horror, but I do not want you to laugh at it. I want you to consider carefully what I am really saying. I feel that we are placed on this earth to adore our Maker, to know ourselves, in other words, to realize ourselves and therefore to realize our destiny. Vivisection cannot add,  in  my opinion, an inch to our moral height. It may—though many medical men tell me that it is not an absolutely correct statement—it may, I say, bring in some relief to a man whose body is ailing. But I must honestly confess to you that I believe in placing limitations upon the remedies for keeping the body alive. After all it is a broken weed to rely upon. It may slip out of our hands at any moment. I recovered from the skilful handling of Col. Maddocklibtech_527_footnotefrom the operation that was performed by him upon me. But there was no guarantee whatsoever that after my recovery I may not fall under a stroke of lighting or under some other accident. Such being the case, I feel that we have got to explore whether we should restrain  ourselves  or whether we might let ourselves go.
I have only given you one illustration of the limitation that I
 
 
 would place upon scientific research and upon the uses of science. Therefore, I would simply say—as I have said to so many of the students of India, and I have the good fortune to enjoy the confidence of the students world and the good fortune to come in contact with the thou- sands and thousands of students all over India, and therefore I would not hesitate to tell them—that they must make up their minds about one thing at least in life, viz., to understand what they are in this world for. I place the same view in all humility before professors and teachers and it is for that reason that I have so often written and spoken upon and against the materialistic tendency of modern civilization—I will not say Western civilization though as it so happens for the time being, the two have become convertible terms. But there is another aspect also which I would like to place before you. Many students go in for science not for the sake of knowledge but for the sake of livelihood that their scientific studies might give them. It is true not only for students belonging to colleges of science, but it is equally true of students belonging to any other college. But seeing that science is one of the few things in which you have to go in for accuracy of thought and accuracy of handling, the warning that I wish to utter to you will perhaps come home to you with greater force than to others.
 I would like you to keep the two most brilliant examples we have in our own dear country, and those two are Drs. J.C. Boselibtech_528_footnoteand
 P.C. Raylibtech_529_footnotelibtech_530_footnote. At least to the students of science, they must be household words, household names. I believe that they are household names to the whole of the educated India. They went in for science for the sake of science and we know what they have achieved. They never thought of what the profession of science would bring them in the shape of money or fame. They cultivated it for the sake of it and Sir J.C. Bose once told me that he had accepted the limitations for himself long before I had uttered a single word about how we should apply our minds to science and I speak upon his authority that all his researches have been devoted in order to enable us to come nearer our Maker.
 But students in India labour under one very serious disability. Those who go in for this class of education or for higher education are drawn from the middle class. Unfortunately for us and unfortu-
 
 nately for our country, the middle classes have almost lost the use of their hands and I hold it to be utterly impossible for a boy  to understand the secrets of science or the pleasures and the delights that scientific pursuits can give, if that boy is not prepared to use his hands, to tuck up his sleeves and labour like an ordinary labourer in the streets.
 I well remember the classes that I used to attend on chemis- try. It seemed to me then to be one  of  the  dullest  subjects. (Laughter.) I know now what an interesting subject it is.  Although  I am an adorer of all my teachers, I must confess to you that the blame was not mine but that of my teacher. He asked me to learn by heart all those  awful  sounding  names  without  knowing  what they were. He never agreed to place even the different metals before me. I had simply to learn things by heart. He brought frightful notes carefully written by him, read those notes to us; we had to copy those notes and memorize them. I revolted and failed in that one subject, (Laughter.) so much so that he might not have issued to me the certificate for goin in for my Matriculation Examination. Fortunately for me, I was at that time ill; he took pity on me and issued the certificate. Had it been so, he would really have blamed me for not having passed in the Chemistry paper instead of blaming himself.
 So, the professors and teachers—I except you, Sir, and your race from the category—the Indian teachers and professors and the Indian students, all sail in the same boat. Science is essentially one of those things in which theory alone is of no value whatsoever—unless you have practical knowledge and unless you conduct practical experiments. I wonder how far you go in for practical experiments and how far you take the keenest delight in it. If you go in for science in the right spirit then I know that there is nothing so great or so valuable for making us accurate in thought and accurate in action. Unless our hands go hand in hand with our heads we would be able to do nothing whatsoever.
 Unfortunately we, who learn in colleges, forget that India lives in her villages and not in her towns.
 India has 7,00,000 villages and you, who receive a liberal educa- tion, are expected to take that education or the fruits of that education to the villages. How will you infect the people of the villages with your scientific knowledge? Are you then learning science in terms of the villages and will you be so handy and so practical that the knowledge
 
 that you derive in a college so magnificently built—and I believe equally magnificently equipped—you will be able to use for  the benefit of the villagers ?
 Lastly then, I place before you the instrument to which you may apply your scientific knowledge and that is the humble spinning- wheel. Seven lakhs villages in India are today pining for want of that simple instrument. It was in every home and every cottage of India only a century ago, and at that time, India was not a lazy country that it is today. Her agriculturists—and agriculturists form 85 per cent of the population—were not forced to be idle for at least four months in the year. That is not what I am telling you. This is not my testimony. This is the testimony of another scientist, that is Mr. Higginbottomlibtech_531_footnotelibtech_532_footnote. He has lately been giving evidence before the Taxation Committee and he said that India’s poverty, which was growing, would not diminish but would grow unless the Indian millions had a supplementary occupation. Now apply your scientific means to finding out what such supplementary occupation can be which will serve the needs of 7,00,000 villages scattered over a surface 1,900 miles long and 1,500 miles broad, and I assure you, you will come to the same irresistible conclusion that I have, that nothing but the spinning-wheel can do it.
 The spinning-wheel has gone out of use now. Wherever I go I ask for a spinning wheel and instead of a spinning-wheel I get a toy. I cannot get good yarn, which will give you good khaddar, out of toys. It is for you to make the spinning-wheel hum. I present to you the noble example of Dr. P. C. Ray who is the maker of the Bengal Chemical Works. It is a growing concern which has furnished a calling for hundreds of students. But Dr. Ray is a scientist of scientists and he wanted to give the benefit of his scientific knowledge to the villagers of India. Because he was working at the time of the Khulna famine he saw the secret of the spinning-wheel and you know today that he is devoting his life only to the spinning-wheel propaganda and the noble band of workers under him, all scientists, are endeavouring to perfect the spinning-wheel, to perfect every accessory required for the spinning-wheel. It is a noble calling. It is worthy of scientists. May it also find an abiding place in your hearts. I thank you for giving me this patient hearing. (Cheers.)
 The Principal then garlanded Mahatmaji and presented a beautiful flower bouquet. Mahatmaji said, “I thought it would be of homespun yarn.” As Mahatmaji
 
 stepped into the car he said, “I expect to see you all next time in khaddar, khaddar woven by yourselves.” Amid cries of “Vandemataram” and cheers Mahatmaji left the Science College premises.

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO WELCOME 		ADDRESSES, TRIVANDRUMlibtech_533_footnote  
 March 13, 1925
 Mahatmaji, in the course of a joint reply, wished publicly to express his thanks to Her Highness the Maharani and also to the Dewan whom he interviewed on the Vykom struggle. He had also visited Swami Narayana Guru at Sivagiri Math and heard some of the Pulaya boys reciting Sanskrit. Ezhavas were clean and as good as the highest in the land and it hurt his sense of religion, humanity and sense of nationalism because the Swamiji could not enter the prohibited roads of Vykom.
 Referring to the discussion with obstructionists at Vykom, the Mahatma said he placed three proposals before them for acceptance. The first was a referendum either at Vykom or the whole of Travancore restricted only to savarna Hinduslibtech_534_footnote, which the spokesmen would not accept but stated that the verdict of the majority could not possibly bind those who had settled convictions. In the second place Mahatmaji offered to place the authority on which the spokesman based his settled convictions before learned Shastris of India but it was said their decision as to authenticity and interpretation was not binding on the obstructionists who were free to reject it if hostile to them. Thirdly on behalf of satyagrahis, he undertook to nominate one Shastri as arbitrator asking the oppositionists to nominate their arbitrator, the Dewan sitting as umpire over them, Mahatmaji undertaking to be bound by the arbitrator’s decision and the umpire, whatever it was. These offers were still open for acceptance, and he asked the savarna Hindus and the whole Hindu community to insist on breaking down the prejudice of orthodoxy in Vykom, and compel by pressure of public opinion the opening of these roads to the untouchables and unapproachables. Both the Maharani and the Dewan appreciated the proposals made and showed their sympathy with the reformers and both had promised to the best of their ability to help the reform movement otherwise than by legislation at the present moment. He felt sure that organized public opinion would help the reformers even by legislative action. He had invited Her Highness to help them in obtaining a
 
 referendum, but whether she was able to do so or not, there was nothing to prevent them from organizing public opinion. Blind orthodoxy could not stand the fierce light of local public criticism provided it was sympathetic, non-violent and humble. There were only sixty thousand Brahmins, compared to eight lakh non-Brahmins and 17 lakh untouchables in Malabar, and while he was gratified on their educational advancement, he felt they should not be refused the rights of common humanity. Mahatmaji concluded his speech by making an appeal particularly to ladies who were present in large numbers to wear khaddar.

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO MUNICIPAL 		ADDRESS, TRIVANDRUMlibtech_535_footnote  
 March 14, 1925
 From what little I have been able to see of Travancore and its conditions, I can heartily endorse the sentiments that you have expressed in your address in connection with the Royal House of Travancore. As I have been saying to my friends who were with me, the severe simplicity of the Royalty in Travancore has bewitched me. I know the position of so many Princes of India that I must confess I was totally unprepared for this simplicity of life that rules the Royalty in Travancore and I thought that I would be guilty of discourtesy or suppressing the truth if I did not publicly give voice to what has so enraptured me.
 After referring to the existence of two dirty slums in Trivandrum which he had noticed in his drive, he considered that a Municipal Councillor to be worthy of his office should regard himself as the custodian of the health of the citizens he  represented. The majority of diseases in towns were due to dirt, filth and filthy air. He instanced the case of Trichinopoly where nuisance was committed on the banks of the Cauvery, the water of which was drunk by the people. Though Trichinopoly was a big town, its water supply was so awfully neglected by its citizens, but in Trivandrum he was struck by its cleanliness. People stifled themselves in big towns and cities in dungeons where no fresh air could be had and he was glad they lived in cottages in Travancore scattered all over the land. As a lover of municipal life, he had studied the activities of many Corporations and considered it a misfortune that he had not been able to devote his lifetime to municipal service.
 Continuing, Mahatmaji stated that though his countrymen were suffering in South Africa under disabilities which he thought was only a passing phase, South Africa had very noble people who understood the world current. Whatever their views
 
 in connection with colour, he had the privilege of learning a great deal from their management of Corporations. They had made ugly spots pretty. Johannesburg which was merely a sandy desert, was turned into a garden, and they had spent a fortune over adorning that beautiful city. When plague broke out in Johannesburg, they spent money like water and rid the town of disease in 24 hours. They isolated the area, and the Government, on the report of the Sanitary Inspector, reduced to ashes a beautiful market. To take time by the forelock and take energetic measures was municipal economy.
 The ordinary life of municipalities throughout India should be untouched by politics, but concentrated upon the health of the citizens, upon their proper feeding and upon their proper education. He did not for a moment share the belief that municipalities should control merely the primary education of children, but thought they should take care of the highest form of education of the children that grew under their care. His experience with two great Corporations convinced him that municipalities should also have the control of the Police of their towns, besides the lighting of streets and scavenging. In congratulating the townsmen on the passing of the spinning resolution in the Council, he asked them to work it in earnest.

   SPEECH AT LAW COLLEGE, TRIVANDRUMlibtech_536_footnote  
 March 14, 1925
 After paying a short visit to the Fort High School and the Mahila Mandiram, an association for women to which a hostel also is attached, Mahatma Gandhi came to the Law College where Mr. M. K. Govinda Pillai, Acting Principal of the College, received him. An address was presented by the students to which Mahatmaji made a reply in the course of which he gave an account of his early education, his first voyage to England and his initiation into the bar 40 years ago when the profession was overcrowded. He advised the students who took to law to have a complete mastery  of facts, to understand human nature, to sift every case given to them, and if they found it a just cause that commended itself to them, to take it up or otherwise throw it overboard. They as lawyers should not sell their conscience for a mess of pottage. When they got a good case, they should identify themselves with the client and make the client’s case their own by asking for all the facts they wanted without being led by him.
 You know how strongly I have spoken against lawyers and their ways—but who should speak if not I who knew all the intricacies of legal life, who knew all the spheres of a legal life—and so I took courage to deliver myself of what was within me in connection with the legal profession.
 
 The late Sir Pherozeshah Mehta and  Badruddin  Tyabjilibtech_537_footnotewere not by any means the tallest among lawyers, but their services to the national cause were invaluable. The late Mana Mohan Ghoselibtech_538_footnotewas a friend of the poor and he refused to charge fees when it was a poor man’s case. He rendered invaluable services at the time of the Indigo riots in Bengal.libtech_539_footnote
 In asking them to study the lives of lawyers like Ghose, Mahatma Gandhi asked them not merely to be satisfied with the heritage those great lawyers had left for them, but wished the present generation to do better. They should become the poor man’s friend in every sense and then alone would they be able to justify the legal profession. Their end was not to get more than a decent livelihood or how to shine in life, but to serve humanity in order to serve the motherland. They ought not to become lawyers in order to increase cases. The education they received ought not to be prostituted to the base use of earning a livelihood, it ought to be used to promote moral growth to enable them to realize themselves, to understand that there was the Maker who saw everything and registered all thoughts, pure and impure, and the learning they derived should be dedicated to a vigorous self-analysis and not prostituted.
 Concluding, Mahatmaji gave the students the message of the spinning-wheel and asked them to remember that not from the law-books or platform oratory but only from the spinning-wheel would they find the deliverance of India.
 A purse of Rs.500 was given over to Mahatmaji as proceeds of collections made yesterday at the public meeting.

   IN SEARCH OF KNOWLEDGE  
 A French writer has written a story with the title ""In Search of Knowledge"". The writer sends many learned men in this search to different continents. One of them comes to India. This seeker goes to those who have understood  Brahmanlibtech_540_footnoteto those who have learned the Shastras, to coutriers and others, but fails to get knowledge anywhere. He is convinced that knowledge means the search for God. Finally, he comes upon the home of an Antyaja. Here he finds devotion at its best. Here for the first time he experiences simplicity, innocence, and artlessness. Here he comes face to face with God, and he reaches the conclusion that one who wishes to discover God easily must search for Him amongst the poor and the humble.
 This is an imaginary story. Our Shastras, however, bear witness to this very truth. Sudamalibtech_541_footnotereadily found God. Mirabailibtech_542_footnotefound  God when she ceased to be a queen. Duryodhanalibtech_543_footnote, because he went and sat near Krishna’s head, got the latter’s army only. God became the charioteer of Arjunalibtech_544_footnotewho sat at His feet.
 These thoughts have occurred to me because of the following letter:libtech_545_footnote
 It has been written by one who has a clear conscience. The correspondent is in search of knowledge. However, the more he seeks it, the more it evades him. He is making vain efforts to grasp by reason something which is beyond reason. Giving up the desire for the fruit of one’s action does not imply that no result will follow. It implies that every action brings in its result and in the mysterious scheme of things, where fibres are so interwoven that the trunk is not distinguishable from the branches, who can identify the fruit of one man’s action amidst the complex of the collective acts of many persons? What right have we to know this? Even a king’s soldier has no right to know the result of his own action, why should we who are the servants of the people know the results of our particular actions? Is
 
 it not enough to know that action necessarily brings results?
 This correspondent, however, has no faith in Ramanama, no faith in God. I beg him to have faith in the experiences of millions of men. The world subsists on the omnipresence of God. Ramanama is God’s name. If anyone is hostile to Ramanama, let him worship God by any other name that he likes. There is no reason to believe that the example of Ajamillibtech_546_footnoteis fictitious. But the question is not whether Ajamil did exist; it is whether someone did save himself by chanting the name of God. To disregard the experiences of mankind as described by the authors of the Puranas, is to disregard the history of mankind. The battle against maya is going on all the time. A person such as Ajamil chanted the name of Narayana while fighting that battle. Mirabai repeated  the   name   of   Giridharlibtech_547_footnotewhile  sleeping,   sitting,  eating   or drinking. This is not a substitute for struggle, but rather it sanctifies the struggle. Anyone who chants Ramanama, who repeats the Dwadashamantra, is not defeated in his battle with maya, but defeats the latter. Hence the poet has sung that although maya entices all, it accepts defeat at the hands of the true devotees of God.
 The  example  of   Rama   confronting   Ravanalibtech_548_footnoteis  ever   present before us. If this does not satisfy one, it only means that one regards Rama and Ravana as historical characters. As such, they no longer exist. However, Ravana as maya continues to exist today and Rama’s devotees, those whose heart is His abode, are every day destroying Ravana.
 What a delusion it is to desire to know that which is known only after death? What would be the plight of a child of five if it desires to know what is going to happen to him at fifty? However, just as an intelligent child can guess his future from the experience of others , we too can satisfy ourselves by guessing the state after death on the basis of other men’s experience.
 Where is the need, however, to know what is to happen after death? Is it not sufficient to know that good actions are well rewarded and evil ones bring forth bitter fruits? The fruit of the best actions is moksha, this is the definition of moksha that I would suggest to the above correspondent.
 
 The correspondent has taken an image literally, has used a mislea-ding metaphor and, as a result, has fallen into a trap. The image is not God. Man, however, projects godliness on it and makes it an object of rapt contemplation. We cannot create human beings out of wood nor use wooden dolls to serve our purpose; but hundreds of thousands of those good sons and daughters, who refresh the memories of their parents throu-gh photographs do nothing wrong! God is omnipresent, even a pebble in the Narmada can represent Him and serve as an object of worship.
 Finally, if the correspondent feels that he will find happiness in villages and in service to villagers through the spinning-wheel and such other things, he should hasten to go there.

 Navajivan, 15-3-1925
 
   CONCERNING “NAVAJIVAN ”  
A subscriber of Navajivan has written a long letter of complaint.
Its substance is as follows:
  Navajivan 	has become 	like a 	monthly magazine because 	it contains 	uninteresting and 	depressing articles on 	the spinning-wheel 	and khadi. Mahadev 	gives something 	like a 	diary of 	my tours in the 
Navajivan and goes on writing on the same theme.
  The 	supplement to 	Navajivan which 	is supposed 	to deal 	with education 	gives disheartening news regarding education; but 	it too 	has no 	plans for education. Other articles find no place in Navajivan. This is indeed the 
limit.
 Perhaps 	no other weekly 	in the world is as expensive as 
Navajivan. Moreover, although the prices of paper have gone down, the price of Navajivan remains the same.
 There is some truth in these arguments. The subscriber wishes me to discuss this matter in the paper.
 I regard the subscribers as partners in Navajivan. I insist on publishing it only as long as a certain minimum number of persons subscribe to it. I also propose to meet its expenses through subscriptions alone and not through advertisements. Hence its subscribers can, if they so desire, put an end to its publication.
 
 It is indeed true that Navajivan is not a newspaper, but a paper intended to propagate certain views. It tests these views in two ways: in the first place by bringing them up for discussion from time to time, and secondly, by finding out the number of people who support these views.
 Navajivan searches for the means for securing swaraj and puts them before the public; hence it presents something new. It does not attempt to do what other newspapers do. What is not found in other newspapers constantly appears in Navajivan, and in this way the paper maintains its novelty and distinctiveness. It does not propose  to compete with other newspapers.
 It is obvious that Navajivan is not as interesting as it used to be. At one time its subscribers numbered about 40,000 as against only 6,000 today. Swami Anand believes that the reason is that now-a-days I write more for Young India and less for Navajivan. I do not think this is correct. Young India is in the same pitiable plight today as Navajivan. Its circulation, too, which had reached the figure of 30,000 is now almost the same as that of Navajivan.
 Nevertheless, I still cherish the desire to write more in Navajivan. God willing, it will be fulfilled, and then the Swami’s doubts will be resolved.
 The fact is that what I am putting before the public now is neither intoxicating nor exciting. Moreover, there is no hope of winning swaraj soon. Navajivan does not put forward new means for securing swaraj but it rather attempts to place before the public the same old means in new ways. It is interesting precisely because it is uninteresting. As it promotes the cause of swaraj, it is only those who have faith in the spinning-wheel and such other means that subscribe to it; this is enough to satisfy me. Its publication will continue so long as a certain minimum number of subscribers are pleased with it.
 Those who look upon the spinning-wheel as a powerful means for securing swaraj, those who regard it as the panacea for ridding India of her poverty, will not tire of Navajivan. I have no doubt that those who have patience and faith will come to realize the power of that weapon, if not today then tomorrow, and I hope that readers of Navajivan will never entertain such doubts.
 The fact that Shri Mahadev Desai gives a diary of my tours should not be a cause for complaint. My tours are not for my pleasure but for service. Hence readers have a right to know their impact and it
 is my duty to report it in some form or other . It is indeed a fault of Mahadev’s diary that it often praises me. That, however, seems to be inevitable. My secretary who travels along with me and who works as my slave, can hardly be my critic. What inspires him to accompany me can be only love or a sort of fascination. He is not tempted by a salary. I can exercise restraint on his praises, but I cannot altogether prevent these. If the good opinion of those who are my close associates does not swell my head with pride, I would rather look upon it as a burden and make special efforts to be worthy of it. As long as I do so, this praise is not likely to prove harmful.
 Nevertheless, I wish to stress this criticism of the correspondent. There is always a danger lurking behind praise. If a son continuously praises his father, he is likely to commit the sin of misleading his father. Hence a son who loves his father does not praise him. On the other hand, the father who continuously praises his son is likely to do him harm rather than good. Or, friends who sing the praises of each other are likely to dig each other’s graves.
 Hence, I request Mahadev to comprehend the essence of the correspondent’s criticism and act upon it. I myself will try and be more on my guard.
 There is a difficulty even in this, namely, that I cannot read all that Mahadev writes before it is published in Navajivan and I cannot do so even afterwards. Hence certain things are published which could have been omitted had I read them in time. In these circumstances, if Navajivan performs other useful service, this particular defect, so far as it is unavoidable, may please be ignored by those like the present subscriber.
 The supplement on education is also issued as a matter  of service. When it was decided that the Vidyapith would save a considerable sum by issuing its magazine on education as a supplement to Navajivan, it was resolved to do so. It too reflects a truthful picture of national education, and hence, it is but natural that its readers feel disheartened. The truth, even if it is uninteresting or painful , must be told wherever it is relevant. National education is at a low ebb today, hence a review of it must carry disappointing news. However, rays of hope are emerging from this dark disappointment. The reader should not concentrate on the number of children who take advantage of it, but should rather note the kinds of difficulties amidst which the ship of education is making headway. That which is
 
 being poured into national education today will generate fearlessness in children, will make them fit for swaraj, and will lead  to  their physical , mental and spiritual advancement.
 There is no need now to show why the price  of  Navajivan cannot be reduced. Nevertheless, I would add that those who subscribe to Navajivan are its owners, and the profits earned by it are not private but public income. Navajivan cannot be made a monthly as it does not contain merely articles; it is a weekly record of progress towards swaraj.

250. QUINTESSENCE OF NON-VIOLENCE
A certain gentleman asks the following questions:
  Is 	it a fact 	that in the 	manufacture of 	foreign sugar, bones, 	blood and such 	other unclean things are added? Can 	anyone who 	observes the 	vow of non-violence 	consume foreign 
sugar?
 Will thsoe who wear khadi as a matter of non-violence continue to do so 
after securing swaraj or will they wear all kinds of cloth afterwards?
  Is 	Khadi related 	to non-violence 	or is it a 	political matter? As 	between [Indian] 	mill-made cltoh and 	foreign cloth, 	which is worse 	from the standpoint 	of violence, 	considering that both are 	equally machine-made?  Can 	anyone who 	observes the 	vow of non-violence 	drink tea? 	If the 	answer is in the negative, how does it involve any violence? 
I hesitate to answer such questions as they indicate ignorance.
 Nevertheless, since readers frequently raise such doubts, it is proper that they should be resolved. Moreover, while answering these questions, I wish to indicate the essence of non-violence as I understand it.
 It is not that foreign sugar contains bones and such other substances, but that these are said to be used in the process of refining sugar. There is no reason to believe that Indian sugar is not subjected to this same. process.
 Hence, from the standpoint of non-violence, the use of both kinds of sugar should, perhaps, be given up. Or, if it has to be taken, the process of its manufacture should be ascertained. Thus, foreign
 sugar has to be renounced solely for giving an impetus to swadeshi. There is, however, a subtle non-violent consideration for which all sugar might be given up. Every process involves violence, hence the less an edible substance is processed, the better. It is best to eat sugarcane, jaggery is next in order, and sugar is the worst of all. I do not see any necessity for the common man to enter into such minute details.
 Those who wear khadi should continue to do so after the attainment of swaraj, both for the sake of swaraj and of non- violence. The very same means by which we shall secure swaraj will enable us to preserve and strengthen it. A nation which relies upon others for its necessities loses its independence or enslaves others. Wearing khadi is a matter of non-violence, politics and economics. In accordance with the above-mentioned law, khadi involves less of violence as it is processed less.
 Then again, as between foreign and [Indian] mill-made cloth, although both are manufactured by the same kind of machines, the use of the latter involves less of violence, as wearing it connotes a feeling of love for our neighbours, whereas the use of foreign cloth not only implies a lack of such feeling but connotes the presence of sheer self-indulgence, selfishness and indifference to others. It also implies absence of benevolence, and non-violence.
 Anyone who practises the vow of non-violence may or may not drink tea. There is life even in tea; it is not an essential article of food and, therefore, the violence involved in drinking it is not unavoidable. Giving up tea is therefore desirable. Indentured labourers are employed wherever there are tea gardens. India is well aware of the miseries of such labourers. From the point of view of non-violence, an article in producing which the labourers suffer should also be given up. In actual practice, we do not go into such minute details, hence we could regard tea as being innocent from the standpoint of non- violence just as we do in the case of other things. From the medical point of view, tea is more harmful than beneficial, especially when it is boiled.
 It is clear from the above questions that those who talk of non- violence know very little about it. Non-violence is a quality of the mind. One who has not understood it will gain little by renouncing any number of things. A sick person who gives up many things because of his illness gets no other benefits besides being cured of his disease. The victims of famine, who get no food to eat, do not reap the
 fruit of fasting for that reason. One who has no self-control, although his outward acts may look like the result of such control, acquires no merit. Non-violence does not consist merely in restrictions on eating. It is the virtue of the Kshatriya. A coward cannot practise it. The brave alone can show mercy. An act can be said to be non-violent in so far as it is compassio-nate. Knowledge is necessary for compassion. Blind love is not non-vio-lence. The mother who under the influence of blind love pampers her child in all sorts of ways practises violence born out of ignorance rather than non-violence. I wish that people would not attach undue importance to restrictions on eating and drinking and, while observing these restri-ctions, understand the meaning of non-violence in its broader sense, its subtle form and essence. A Western saint who eats beef because it is cus-tomary there, is a million times more non-violent than a wicked hypo-crite who following the custom in his country does not eat beef. The person who has put the questions to me should say to himself: “Although I give up foreign sugar, foreign cloth and tea, if I do not have compassion for my neighbour, if I do not regard other people’s children as my own, if I am not honest in my trade, if I do not regard my servants as members of my family and do not love them, the restrictions on my diet are meaningless, they are mere show, senseless practices   born   out   of   ignorance.”    Narasinha   Mehta’slibtech_549_footnotelibtech_550_footnotesacred utterance is, “So long as one has not realized the truth about the atman all penance is in vain.” To realize the self is to become non- violent. To be non-violent is to love even one’s opponent , to do good to him who has harmed us, to reward vice with virtue, and while doing so, to look upon it not as something strange but as one’s natural duty.

   NOTES  
 A TEACHER’S DIFFICULTY
A teacher writes:libtech_551_footnote
 As this teacher has answered his own questions, my task is simplified. What I had said could not possibly mean that ten teachers
 
 or a single teacher should rest after teaching only one child. My contention is that not merely ten but even twenty teachers should not forsake a solitary student or leave a school but should try to increase their number. When plenty of students are available, the teacher should draw an allowance sufficient for his living, but his true test lies in his ability to accept nothing and starve to death if the need arises, and let his dependents also starve to death. Such a teacher sacrifices his relations, his parents, his children, his all for his work. What do those who practise other professions do when they incur heavy losses? If a person does not find a job despite all possible efforts, he lets his dependents starve along with himself; this should be the case with the teachers in national schools. This would make our dependents work for their livelihood. When teachers are idle for want of students, they should, of course, take up some other activity, but even while doing so, they must try to revive the school. Moreover, seeking out some other activity means that, in the absence of children, and during spare time, they should earn their living through the work of carding and weaving.

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO WELCOME 		ADDRESSES, KOTTAYAMlibtech_552_footnote  
 March 15, 1925
 It has given me pleasure to be able to come to a place which is the centre of Christian influence. All the world over, I enjoy the privilege of having many Christian friends and I expect from Christians in India a great deal. There is nothing in the programme that I have ventured to place before the nation in which a Christian cannot whole-heartedly participate. Indeed I go so far as to say, if I may do so in all humility, that a Christian is the less a Christian if he does not whole-heartedly participate in this constructive programme. Those who are born and bred in this land, and to whom this land is as much the motherland as it is to me, as it is to the Mussalmans, if these Christians do not promote the nation’s growth, to that extent, I venture to   say,  they  are   denying  Christianity.  You  cannot  serve  God  and
 
 refuse to serve your neighbours. But he who passes over his  neighbour, be he Hindu, Christian or Mussalman, denies his God. I, therefore, suggest to my Christian friends that they should regard it as a special privilege, and therefore special duty, to serve India to the best of their ability.
 We may have different religions, we may hold different views about our conception of God, we may have different views about salvation. But there is one thing which binds all Indians to the soil. There is one thing which binds all Indians, one to another, is an indissoluble tie and that is the spinning-wheel and  its  product khaddar. I harp upon khaddar and the spinning-wheel in season and out of season beacause I know that in khaddar alone, in the spinning- wheel alone, lies the economic salvation of India. The spinning-wheel is a symbol and a symbol of the binding tie between the masses and the classes. The classes derive their sustenance from the labour of the masses and I beg the classes to make some small return to the masses for what they receive from them. I, therefore, say to every Indian, also to every Englishman domiciled in India, or who derives his livelihood from India, let him adopt khaddar. In his own home let him dress himself from top to toe in khaddar and make a return to the masses. (Cheers.)
 I say to the women of Kottayam and the surrounding places and to the men: “If you will reinstate the spinning-wheel in your homes, you will find that you have delivered to the famishing millions of India a message of hope and comfort.”
 Referring to untouchability he said:
 Her Highness and the Dewan have assured me of their sympathy with the reformers and if I have understood them correctly I know that they are only waiting for an emphatic, unequivocal, disciplined and articulate expression of public opinion on the part of the savarna Hindus in order to do away with this disgrace and if the Hindus are true to their faith and will consider themselves as the custodians of the dignity of their religion, and if they feel as keenly as I do about this untouchability, they will not rest satisfied unless they have convinced the Maharani Regent and the Dewan that the whole public opinion of Travancore demands this reform.

   ALL-INDIA COW-PROTECTION SABHA  
 [March 15, 1925]libtech_553_footnote
 Readers will recall that among the many conferences held at Belgaum last December, there was one for the protection of cows. Reluctantly I yielded to importunity and became its chairman.  I believe that the protection of cows is an important and necessary task in this age for those who believe in Hinduism. I think I have been carrying on this work for many years in my own way. The whole of India is aware that the protection of cows is one of the vital reasons for the friendship that I deliberately wish to cultivate with the Muslims. However, I do not regard saving cows from Muslims as the most important aspect of cow-protection. The most important aspect is to make Hindus protect cows. My definition of cow-protection includes sparing cows and bullocks from the cruelty to which they are  subjected.
 However, I have taken little direct interest until today in this great task of protection. I have practised penance in order  to  be worthy of taking such a part but have not yet attained such worthiness.  I was, therefore, hesitant to accept the chair, and yet I did accept it. One of the resolutions of the conference related to establishing a permanent committee. I had to take part in that too. Hence, the committee nominated by the conference met in the last week of Januarylibtech_554_footnotelibtech_555_footnotein Delhi. At that meeting it was decided to establish an All- India Cow-protection Sabha; its constitution was framed and accepted by the committee. The fact that this Sabha could progress so far is primarily due to the famous worker for the cause  of  the  cows, Chaunde Maharaj, who comes from Wai. I am being drawn to it by his earnestness and initiative. The members of the committee included Dadasaheb   Karandikar,   Lala   Lajpat   Rai,  Babu   Bhagwandaslibtech_556_footnotelibtech_557_footnote,  Shri Kelkarlibtech_558_footnotelibtech_559_footnote, Dr. Moonjelibtech_560_footnotelibtech_561_footnote, Swami Shraddhanandjilibtech_562_footnotelibtech_563_footnotelibtech_564_footnoteand others. However, I
 
 would regard the existence of such an Association an impossibility without Shri Malviyaji, the jewel of India. Hence, I suggested that it was necessary to obtain his approval before announcing  the constitution of the proposed society.  This  suggestion  was unanimously accepted. Hence, the task of showing him the draft constitution fell to me. I did so and he gave his approval.
 Nevertheless, I hesitate to publish it because the chairmanship still rests with me. Moreover, the founders would like me to continue.  I am doubtful about my suitability. I feel that so long as those who are regarded as leading Hindus do not approve of this great task, it cannot make any significant progress. I also fear that in view of my firm views on untouchability, my chairmanship may prove harmful. I expressed my doubts of Chaunde Maharaj again. He believes that my views on untouchability have nothing to do with this work and even if some individuals keep away on that score, it is our duty to carry on this work inspite of such a risk.
 I do not know whether it is our duty or not. However, I put before the people the constitution which has been approved bythe committee. I expect to reach Bombay on the 26th; a date has then to be fixed for holding a general body meeting to pass the constitution. The meeting will then be held.
 May He, who came to Draupadi’s rescue, also come to my help.  I am an orphan and look to Him for assistance. He alone knows what love I have for the cause of cow-protection. Should that love be pure, may He make this unworthy servant worthy. I have taken upon my shoulders many responsibilities that He has burdened me with. He may add one more to these, if He so desires. He alone can make me overcome my fears.
 The readers may, perhaps, be unable to realize the nature of my suffering. I am writing this in the early hours of the morning. My pen shakes as I write this. There are tears in my eyes. Yesterday, I have had the darshan of Kanyakumari. If time permits, I will put before the reader the thoughts which overwhelm me. My predicament is very much that of a child who weeps profusely because he does not have the stomach to eat all that he wishes to. I am greedy. I am impatient to see and to demonstrate the victory of dharma. I am ever anxious to do all that may be needed for it. It is for this reason alone that I want swaraj as also the spinning-wheel, Hindu-Muslim unity, cow- protection, abolition of untouchability and prohibition.  Which  of these should I pursue and which should I give up? The ship of my
 longings is thus rolling back and forth on a stormy sea.
 Once there was a fearful storm on the sea. All the passengers were agitated. All prayed for the help of Lord Krishna. The Muslims cried out in the name of Allah. The Hindus started uttering the name of Rama. The Parsis too started chanting their scriptures. I saw  suffering on the faces of all. The storm subsided and all were happy. The very moment they were happy they forgot God and started behaving as if the storm had never been.
 I am in a strange plight. I am ever in the midst of a storm. Hence I cannot but remember Rama, Sitapatilibtech_565_footnotelibtech_566_footnote. However, sometimes, when I experience a great turmoil, I am even more perturbed than my fellow-voyagers and cry out, “Save me, save me.”
 With this preface, I remember the mother-cow, kneel before God and place this constitutionlibtech_567_footnotelibtech_568_footnotebefore the public.

 DEAR MR. PITTlibtech_570_footnote ,
   LETTER TO W. H. PITT  
 
 
ALWAI,
 March 18, 1925
  	With  reference  to  the  conversationslibtech_571_footnotelibtech_572_footnotewe 	 have  had   as  to   the possibility and desirability of removing 	the barriers at Vykom and the picket which prevent satyagrahi 	volunteers from crossing the boundary-line on the roads leading to 	the temple, the position as I understand is this. It is common cause 	between Government and the reformers that the embargo upon the 	so-called untouchables making use of the roads around the temple 	should be removed. In your opinion the cause I have at heart will 	succeed earlier if I advise the satyagrahis to respect the boundary 	line pending final decision  without the barricades and the picket. 	You tell me that the orthodox opinion gathers strength from the 	presence of the barricades and the picket, because the orthodox 	people wrongly infer that the intention in putting up the barricades 	and keeping the pickets is to help them to maintain their position. 	I have gathered from our conversations that it would be possible for 	you to have the existing orders withdrawn under which you are 	acting, if I undertake to respect the boundary-line in the manner 	suggested by you. Whilst I hesitate to believe that the action 	proposed by you, if taken by the satyagrahis, will soften the hearts 	of the orthodox people and weaken their position, I fully appreciate 	the motive that lies behind your suggestion. I am, therefore, 	prepared to advise, by way of trial, adoption of the suggestion made 	by you. After all, what the satyagrahis want is to create an active 	and overwhelming public opinion in their behalf. Their object is not 	to irritate orthodoxy but to win it over to their side. Their object 	moreover is in no way to embarrass the Government in  the  	prosecution of the campaign but, so far as it is possible, to enlist 	its sympathy and support on their side. I am therefore prepared to 	act upon your suggestion immediately on learning from you that the 	prohibitory order referred to herein is withdrawn. The effect of 	this would be that a very small number, not larger than at present, 	will continue to march up to the boundary-line by way of pleading 	their cause and stand or spin as they are now doing in front of the 	lines.     
 They will not cross it on any account whatsoever whilst  their agreement lasts and I expect that if it ever becomes necessary to challenge in a court of law the so-called right or custom under which the so-called untouchables are prohibited from making use of the roads round the temple the prosecution would be under the ordinary criminal law of Travancore. But I am hoping, with the assistance of the Travancore Government, to formulate public opinion so that  it becomes irresistible and that without recourse to law on either side the common right of using public or semi-public roads is not denied to any class of people by reason of their birth. I have already discussed with you the three proposals made by me, namely, referendum by taking the vote of the savarna Hindus in select areas; arbitration; or interpretation and examination of the authority of texts from Hindu Shastras supposed to be available to the orthodox in support of their contention as to the use of roads round certain temples. It must be a very simple matter to adopt one or all of the suggestions.
 In closing this letter I would place on record my sincere thanks for the perfect arrangement made by you during the whole of my sojourn in Travancore.libtech_573_footnote
 I am, Yours sincerely,

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO ADDRESSES, PARURlibtech_574_footnote  
 March 18, 1925
 Mahatmaji in his reply observed that it was in keeping with their traditions that they carried to the very letter whatever they resolved upon and hoped that the resolve, the Municipal Councillors had expressed that they would spin and wear khaddar hereafter, would be followed in earnest. He regretted that untouchability and unapproachability prevailed in worst forms in Travancore and they owed it to the Motherland and Hinduism to eradicate them. He observed that their tastes were so simple that neither men nor women considered it civilized to have multiplicity of clothing. He considered it a matter of shame and humiliation to wear foreign or mill- made clothes. The Ezhavaslibtech_575_footnotelibtech_576_footnotewere weavers who at one time produced all their clothing.
 
 
 He was informed by a Christian that it was impossible to wear khaddar and refused to believe that any Archbishop or Roman Catholic priest could command his flock not to use pure hand-spun and hand-woven khaddar. Organization and expert assistance were required in enforcing their promise to wear khaddar and he appealed to them to get help from Tamilnad friends.

 Gandhiji in his reply congratulated the college on its splendid site and on the hostel being opened by the great poetlibtech_577_footnoteof Asia. To think of earning one’s livelihood out of mental culture was prostitution of education. He was afraid they neglected culture of heart and body. Concluding, the Mahatma asked the students not to be satisfied with benevolent neutrality with regard to khaddar and the spinning-wheel and placed before them the notable example of Dr. P. C. Ray who had dedicated himself to relieve the poor.

   SPEECH AT ADVAIT ASHRAM, ALWAYElibtech_578_footnote  
 [March 18, 1925]libtech_579_footnote
 I am grateful to you for the beautiful address you have given me, which was well read out by an Antyaja boy. I am sorry that I cannot reply to you in Sanskrit. But had I been a Sanskrit pundit, even then I would not have replied in Sanskrit, because unfortunately today we Hindus have neglected the study of Sanskrit and therefore the masses cannot be expected to understand that language. But in order to be in tune with the Sanskrit atmosphere here, I would have spoken in Hindi, had it been possible to do so. However, you would not understand it; this proves our sad plight. I hope that the organizers of the Ashram will provide facilities to enable every student to understand. Hindi. It is essential for us to recognize our limitations. It is beyond our power today to steep our minds in Sanskrit so that all
 
student.
 our communication may be carried on in that language. It is not a difficult thing, however, to start communicating in Hindi.
 Your motto is, “One community, one religion, one God”. I had discussions with Shri Narayan Guru Swami on this subject and since you have given the subject the first place in your welcome address, I am also obliged to mention it in my reply. I feel that the attainment of what is implied by this motto is also beyond our powers. I can understand the principle of one God. In spite of our worshipping Him in a million different ways, our adoration finds its way to Him. However, I feel that so long as the human race continues, differences of creeds and religions will indeed exist, since there are many minds and not one. If we look at Nature, we shall find that it is full of diversities and it is through them that the one God becomes many. To expect that at any stage in the history of the human race the world will have a single religion and a single creed is, I think, as good as wishing that the laws of Nature should become topsy turvy. As a result of my limited reading, reflection and meditation, I feel that human society cannot do without the four-fold divisions of varna and ashrama. Hence, diverse religions and diverse creeds seem to be inevitable. Tolerance should be our aim. If all of us hold uniform views, where then is the scope for this generous virtue of tolerance? However, this search for uniformity is as futile as looking for flowers in the sky. Hence, the only possible alternative for us is to tolerate one antoher’s views. According to my Muslim friends, I, a born idol-worshipper, a believer in incarnation and rebirth, must necessarily cultivate tolerance for Muslims who do not believe in idol-worship, who do not believe in incarnation and perhaps in rebirth. I, a believer in incarnations, do not think that Christ alone was God, or that he alone was the son of God. Nevertheless, I should tolerate the fact that my Christian friends look upon Christ as God and, similarly, Muslims and Christians should tolerate the fact that I bow in reverence to Kanyakumari  and Jagannath. I can see that the age of tolerance is dawning in my own lifetime, because tolerance is at the root of the dharma of ashimsa. That very same tolerance is at the root of the dharma of truth. Truth, like God, has a thousand diverse aspects. I cannot therefore insist that my view about the nature of truth is the correct one, and those of others wrong. That is why I feel we are fast approaching the age of mutual tolerance and mutual love. If, therefore, I cannot persuade Shri Narayan Guru Swami to accept the ideal of tolerance, I shall content by understanding the ideal in my own way.
 Leaving aside this abstract discussion, let us come to more concrete things. While we cannot have before us the ideal of one caste, one religion and one creed, we can certainly have before us the ideal of performing one task daily and regularly for the good of the country. When shall We learn to wear khadi and thereby establish a bond of union with the poorest of the poor? We can learn this one mantra of making common cause with the poor. Instead of talking of universal love, it would be enough if we give up the calico made in the mills of Ahmedabad, Japan or England and win instead the simple love of the poor by wearing cloth spun and woven by  our  own brothers and sisters. Shri Narayan Guru Swami has assured me that he will himself take up spinning and forbid his followers from approaching him unless they are clad in khadi.
 We have to practise the dharma of ahimsa and love in another matter as well. We must free our country from the sin of keeping our own brothers away as untouchables. A caste Hindu approached me and told me that the Ezhavas too treat those who belong to lower castes as untouchables. This must stop. More- over, he also told me that if  the  Ezhavas  and  Pulayaslibtech_580_footnotegave  up  liquor,  the  problem  of untouchability would be automatically solved. I do not regard this as a proper defence. However, the only way open to us is to profit from this advice and do whatever needs to be done. We cannot answer back that caste Hindus too drink secretly. It is sufficient for us to be aware of our own faults and get rid of them. I hope that, in this Sanskrit atmosphere, you will bear in mind whatever I have briefly told you and speedily advance towards the religious ideal which Shri Narayan Guru Swami is placing before you.

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO ADDRESSES, TRICHURlibtech_581_footnote  
 March 18, 1925
 I am sorry that I cannot be in these pleasant surroundings for any length of time. I shall be leaving this beautiful country, I do not know for how long. It is difficult to tear myself away from all the
 
 overwhelming kindness. It is equally difficult to tear myself away from the beautiful scenery that I have witnessed around me.  But among all these pleasant recollections the one bitter recollection that I shall carry with me is that this fair land should be blotted with the curse of untouchability and unapproachability. But I was reminded only just now that there is also in this land the curse of invisibility, that the very sight of man offends. If this is Hinduism I would renounce it today, but as a sanatani Hindu that I call myself, and one brought up in an orthodox family, I know that it is no part of Hinduism to have untouchability, unapproachability or invisibility as they are practised today. But I shall be leaving this land in the hope that all those crowds that have attended such gatherings and all those crowds who have associated themselves in the sentiments expressed in the addresses which have censured this caste custom will see to it that this blot is removed from Travancore and Cochin.
 I have seen thousands of sisters in Travancore and Cochin. To see them in their beautiful white dress has been a perfectly pleasant and ennobling sight for me. But it has equally depressed me to find that they have taken to calico instead of khaddar. If you intend to do so it is possible for you to clothe yourselve, both men and women, in khaddar without the slightst difficulty and without any loss of time. Not very long ago, every home in Malabar had a spinning-wheel. I ask you to reinstate the spinning-wheel in every home. You have even now thousands of Ezhava weavers weaving beautiful cloth. Spin, and they will weave the yarn spun by you. If you will only do this you will find out for yourselves that you have saved lakhs upon  lakhs  of rupees for your land. Both Travancore and Cochin together have a population of nearly 70 lakhs. If I were to count the cost of spinning and weaving, it will come to rupees three on an average per head. That means nearly two crores and ten lakhs. Just think what it means for this land and it costs no effort to you to clothe yourself in khaddar.

   NOTES [-I 		] VYKOM SATYAGRAHA  
 I offer no apology to the reader for giving much space in these pages to Vykom satyagraha by reproducing the whole of that portion
 of the addresslibtech_582_footnoteof the Dewan of Travancore to its Popular Assembly which deals with the Vykom satyagraha. It enables the reader to understand and appreciate the nature of the brave struggle that is being carried on by a band of satyagrahis as also the importance of the cause for which satyagraha is being offered. Vykom is a test case so far as Travancore and, for that matter, Malabar is concerned. It affects the common rights of more than one sixth of the entire population of Travancore. Those therefore who are interested in the removal of the curse of untouchability cannot but read the Dewan’s address with interest. I do not propose to comment on it this week as it would be unfair to do so in view of the fact that I am to have the honour of meeting him before this will have been printed and in view of the further fact that I have not at the time of writing completed my investigations. But I cannot help endorsing the remark of Dewan Bahadur T. Raghaviah that
 there is a world of difference between satyagraha meant to be an educative force and satyagraha intended as an instrument for the coercion of the Government and through them of the orthodox Hindu. What the satyagrahis should aim at is the conversion of the orthodox to whom untouchability is a part of their faith.   I  make bold to state that from  the   very  outset   satyagraha  at
Vykom was intended to be an educative force and never an instrument
 of coercion of the orthodox. It was for that reason that the fast against the orthodox was abandoned. It was to avoid coercion of the Government by embarrassment that the barricades have been scrupulously respected. It was for that reason that no attempt was made to dodge the police. It has been recognized that what appears to the reformers as a gross and sinful superstition is to the orthodox a part of their faith. The satyagrahi’s appeal has therefore been to the reason of the orthodox. But experience has shown that mere appeal to the reason produces no effect upon  those who have  settled convictions. The eyes of their understanding are opened not by argument but by the suffering of the satyagrahi. The satyagrahi strives to reach the reason through the heart. The method of reaching the heart is to awaken public opinion. Public opinion for which one cares is a mightier force than that of gunpowder. The Vykom satyagraha has vindicated itself in that it has drawn the attention of the whole of India to  the cause and it  has  been  instrumental  in   the  Travancore
 
 Assembly considering in a remarkable debate a resolution favouring the reform sought for and lastly in eliciting a considered reply from the Dewan of Travancore. I am sure that victory is a certainty if only the satyagrahis will retain their patience and their spirit of suffering.
 MAN’S INHUMANITY TO MAN
 In the midst of the incessant rush I am going through in this land of palms (Travancore) where I am writing these notes, I cannot resist noting down a never-fading sight I had to witness at Cochin. Cochin has imported from Japan numerous rickshaws which its well- to-do citizens use for their convenience. These are drawn not by animals but by men. I carefully noted as many of these carriers as passed. Not one impressed me with his physique. They had neither the calves nor the chest nor the arms well-formed for the arduous task of carrying a burden in the hot sun and melting heat. The rickshaws are built for carrying one passenger only. In my opinion, it is bad enough for a healthy and full-limbed man to be carried by man, but I was ashamed of my species and pained beyond measure to see two and even three passengers huddled together in some rickshaws. It was no doubt wrong for the carrier not to refuse to carry more than one burden. But what is one to say of the pair or the trio who in order to save a few coppers would not be ashamed to be carried by a member of their species who is hardly fit to carry even one of them. I hope there is a law in Cochin prohibiting the carrying of more than one passenger in these rickshaws. And if there is one, I hope the kindly citizens will see to it that it is strictly obeyed. But if there is no such law, I hope that one would be passed making the carriage of more than one passenger an impossibility. If I had the  power  I  would abolish the rickshaw. But that I know must remain a pious hope. But is it too much to hope that men who ply these rickshaws will be  subjected to a strict medical examination as to their fitness for the heavy work?
 INTER-DINING
 A correspondent asks: “Should children belonging to different castes and living in one boarding-house be made to dine together in a common dining-room?” The question is not well put. But the answer to the question as it is put would be that children cannot be made to inter-dine. If, however, it be urged that no boarding-house keeper can make rules requiring all who care to join it to inter-dine, it would be as unreasonable a demand as it would be to compel children who are
 admitted without such stipulation as to inter-dining to  dine  in company with children belonging to other castes. In the absence of any rule to the contrary, I should imagine that the presumption would be that the usual rules for separate dining arrangements would apply. This question of inter-dining is a vexed one and in my opinion no hard and fast rules can be laid down. Personally, I am not sure that inter-dining is a necessary reform. At the same time I recognize the tendency towards breaking down the restriction altogether. I can find reasons for and against the restriction. I would not force the pace. I do not regard it as a sin for a person not to dine with another nor do I regard it as sinful if one advocates and practises inter-dining. I should, however, resist the attempt to break down the restriction in disregard of the feelings of others. On the contrary I  would  respect  their scruples in the matter.
 THE “KISANS” OF OUDH
 Mr. Manilal Doctor of Fyzabad sends me the following for publication:
 I have been brought over from Gaya to Fyzabad at the request of thousands of kisans.
 In Bihar—in Champaran—I was disillusioned. India is by no means a bed of roses for the workers on land. It is not surprising that Assam, Calcutta, Cawnpore, Ahmedabad, Burma and the distant Colonies are able to attract coolies. Oudh seems to be in a worse condition still. The cry is: “Let us be free from this foreign yoke and labour will have its
 due.” I am not sure in my mind that workers and peasants will get justice at the hands of those who are likely to succeed the British Government.
 Anyhow, the position that I am prepared to act upon is this: The workers and peasants should not allow themselves to be made tools of by either Indian capitalists or the British Government. They must look after  their own  interests and only so far as may be consonant with them, that they may “co- operate” or “non-co-operate”. Of course the charkha should spread amongst them and it will be better for them to spin yarn for clothing themselves with, than spin litigation during the slack months of the Indian year, which is absolutely dependent on the favours of the four rainy months (unlike the tropical colonies, where there are showers throughout the year).
 India is a good country, but human beings—Indian and foreign—have “co-operated” to make a hell of it!!! How long Oh! Lord!! How long !!!”
I hope that Mr. Manilal Doctor will succeed in introducing the
 charkha in every ptals village and in the act make a careful study of
 the economic position of the kisans. What we need is a patient and exact study of typical Indian villages  of  India  such  as  Dr.  Mannlibtech_583_footnotepublished some years ago regarding a few Deccan villages.

   A DIFFICULT PROBLEM  
 An Andhra correspondent invites attention to his difficulties as follows:
 In last week’s Young India in one of your answers to a Bengal correspondent on untouchability you have stated thus: “Since ‘we’ do take water from the hands of Sudras we should not hesitate to accept it from the hands of untouchables”, meaning by “we” the high-caste Hindus. I do not know the customs prevalent in Northern India. But are you aware of the fact that in Andhra as well as in still Southern parts of India Brahmins do not only not take water from the hands of non-Brahmins (of any of the other three castes) but the more orthodox of them observe strict untouchability with non- Brahmins.
 You have often said that you do not advocate inter-dining as essential to the removal of the present false notions of superiority of castes. You have quoted once an instance of Pandit Malaviyaji to bring out the fact that, living as you are in mutual admiration and respect, you could not think Malaviyaji meaning any contempt to you if he refused water or anything else from your hands. I agree there it might have meant no contempt. But do you know that the Brahmins of our part do not take food if seen by a non-Brahmin even if it be from a distance of hundred yards, let alone the touching of it by him? May I also point out that a word or two escaping the mouth of a Sudra in a street is enough to rouse the orthodox Brahmin at meal to anger—and he will go without meal the whole day? In what way can these facts be interpreted if they can mean no contempt? Has not the Brahmin put an air of superiority? Will you please enlighten me on these points? I am myself a Brahmin youth and hence write with first-hand knowledge.
 Untouchability is a hydro-headed monster. It is a deeply moral and religious question. Inter-dining, to me, is a  social  question. Behind the present untouchability there is undoubtedly and necessa-
 
 
 rily contempt for a portion of one’s species. It is a canker that is eating into the vitals of society. It is a denial of the rights of man. It does not stand on a par with inter-dining. And I would strongly urge social reformers not to mix the two. If they do, they would injure the sacred cause of “the untouchables and the unapproa-chables”. The Brahmin correspondent’s difficulty is real. It shows the length to which the evil has been carried. The name Brahmin should be, as it once was, a synonym for utter humility, self-effacement, sacrifice, purity, courage, forgiveness and true knowledge. But today this sacred land is cursed with divisions between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. In many instances the Brahmin has lost the superiority which he never claimed but which was his by right of service. He is now desperately striving to assert what he cannot claim and has, therefore, roused the jealousy of non-Brahmins in some parts of India. Fortunately for Hinduism and fortunately for the country there are Brahmins like the correspondent who are fighting with all their strength the tendency towards the ominous assertion and are serving the non-Brahmins with a selfless pertinacity which is worthy of their high traditions. Everywhere one finds Brahmins in the forefront fighting the evil of untouchability and supporting their brief with authorities from scriptures. I urge the Southern Brahmin of the type mentioned by the Andhra correspondent to recognize the signs of the times and rid himself of false notions of superiority or of superstition that smells sin in the visible approach of a non-Brahmin or regards his dinner as polluted if he hears the voice of a non-Brahmin. The Brahmins taught the world to see Brahman in everything. Surely then there can be no defilement from outside. It comes from within. Let the Brahmin re- deliver the message that the untouchables and the unapproachables are the evil thoughts that one harbours. He taught the world to believe that “man is truly his own deliverer as he is also his own defiler or captor”.
 The non-Brahmin must not be ruffled by the things mentioned by the Andhra correspondent. Brahmins like the  Andhra correspondent will fight, as they are fighting, his battle. He must not, as I fear is the growing tendency, despise the whole race of Brahmins because of the sins of a few. Let him be dignified enough not to claim right conduct towards himself from those who will misconduct themselves. I need not feel insulted because the passerby does not acknowledge me or because he feels polluted by my touch  or presence or voice. It is enough that I refuse at his bidding to move
 from my path or to desist from speaking for fear of his hearing my voice. I may pity his ignorant assumption of superiority or his superstition but I may not get irritated and develop the contempt I would fain resent when directed towards myself. The non-Brahmin will lose his case by loss of self-restraint. Above all let him not, by overstepping the mark, embarrass his Brahmin champions. The Brahmin is the finest flower of Hinduism and humanity. I will do nothing to wither it. I know that it is well able to take care of itself. It has weathered many a storm before now. Only let it not be said of non-Brahmins that they attempted to rob the flower of its fragrance and lustre. I would not have the non-Brahmins to rise on the ruin of the Brahmins. I would rather that they rose to the height that the Brahmins have occupied before now. Brahmins are born, not so Brahminism. It is a quality open to be cultivated by the lowliest or the lowest among us.

   NOTES  [-II 		] “A MAD 		MAN 		OR A SAINT”  
A friend has taken the trouble of copying out the following
 extracts from My Magazine which he tells me is intended for children and asks me to reply to it:
 Something happened to his soul in 1918 which was fatal to its power. He became neither a saint nor a statesman, but a fanatic.  In losing heart in
 Britain’s word Gandhi also lost his head.
 In his anger against European civilization he has gone to the extreme point of condemning all science and all culture. He would abolish the schoolmaster and the doctor as well as the engineer. He would do away with the bacteriologist as well as the manufacturer. No one is to learn anything. The body of man is to dwell in everlasting passiveness and the soul is to do nothing but receive the whispers of God.
 We may seek to justify him, and say that European civilizaiton is a disease. We may speak of disease and strikes, of slums and destitution, of vice and shameless luxury; and yet, when all is said and done, it is the engineer who has irrigated the deserts of India, the doctor who has fought down plague, and the schoolmaster who has quickened the Indian mind. Without the ceaseless toil of scientific men, India would be decimated by disease; and without the protection of Britain she would become the slave of Japan.
 
 Gandhi believes that the soul of men must get back to some fabulous time in the past when all was peace and love; we believe that the soul of man must march forward from barbarism and inertia to knowledge, power and dominion. Gandhi thinks we are on the wrong road; we think our raod, difficult as it is, leads to a better world. Gandhi thinks a man is elevated only by his spirit; we think that a man’s spirit can best be elevated by a mind that is never satisfied. We believe in work, knowledge, and dominion. Gandhi believes in non- resistance, ignorance and passiveness.
 There is something in this indictment against European civilization, but we must not be led away to suppose that India is a land of beauty, peace, and goodness, reposing in the love of God. There are things in India not to be spoken of, so horrible are they; and there are slums in India not to be matched by anything in Europe. If our civilization is dangerous to spritual life the civilization of India is fatel. Let the mind of man drowse, and it will perish.
 It is not immodest to think that we can help Gandhi if he will do us the courtesy of regarding what is best in our civilization, and not only what is worst.
 A LIBEL
 The article from which the extracts are taken is said to  be  devoted to a critical examination of what I am supposed to stand for and is headed “An Extraordinary Man. Is He a Mad  Man  or  a Saint?” I have often said that I do not claim to be an extraordinary man unless one who is mad after the search for truth be called extraordinary. I am certainly mad in the sense that every honest man should be. I have disclaimed the title of a saint for  I  am  fully conscious of my limitations and imperfections. I claim to be a servant of India and therethrough of humanity.
 The writer of the article is honest but ignorant and yet writes with an assurance which is amazing. The pity of it is that the writing of that character is not an uncommon thing in modern literature. If palpable untruth can be put before the public about contemporary men and women, one shudders to think of the distortion that must appear years after they are gone.
 Let us see how truth has suffered at the hands of the writer of the article. “In his anger against European civilization, he has gone to the extreme point of condemning all science and all culture,” says the writer. Though I have undoubtedly spoken and written strongly against Europ-ean civilization, I cannot recall ever having condemned “all science and all culture”. My life is a standing testimony against
 the libel. Every sentence that follows thereafter is the reverse of truth. Where the writer has derived his idea of desire to abolish schoolmasters and engineers I do not know. Anybody who knows anything of me knows that I loathe pas-siveness of the body. I recognize the everlasting activity of nature going on about me and I respond to it by keeping my own body and those of my co-workers in incessant activity, always, I hope, of a beneficial character. The writer tells us that “without the protection of Britain she (India) would become the slave of Japan”. If a schoolboy was called upon to point out the inacccuracy of the statement, will he not say that with- out the slavery of Britain, India would be a free nation living in peace and alliance with Japan and her other Asiatic neighbours? The writer considers the civilization of India fatal to spiritual life. No European scholar to my knowledge has made such a statement. Whatever else India may not be, she is at least one thing. She is the greatest storehouse of spiritual knowledge. She is the best representative of spiritual life. She does not let the mind “drowse” for one single moment.
 “HOW TO LIVE”
 On reading an article of his in Young India, a correspondent sent Mr. Andrews the following poser which he handed to me for reply some months ago:
 I was born and bred up in a village. My father used to repeat Ahimsa paramo dharmahlibtech_584_footnoteoff and on, while engaged in religious conversations with his friends. It is, as you say, the complementary truth following from the original truth of the Advaitamlibtech_585_footnote. Let me admit the truth substantially. Let me further submit that Advaitam is not confined to oneness of all spiritual life. It is, as you apear to hold, the oneness of all things in the universe, without any exception of whatever kind.
 The moment one gets himself fitted to catch Advaitam as his guide, his progress is assured. All differences must disappear. We are all one. How am I justified in injuring that which is myself? Here doubts begin to crop up. Is the idea of ahimsa to be carried into practice to its logical end? If so carried to the end, will it remain a vritue?
 My father used to repeat Ahimsa paramo dharmah. However, when the family buffalo took into its—why not ‘her’—head not to stand still for being
 
 milked, my father used to take up the stick and beat her to her senses. That was for securing milk for his children. Did he do the right thing?
 The Hindus call the avatar of Rama as Dharma Avatarlibtech_586_footnote. Rama killed Ravana. Was it a wrong deed? Rama killed Bali and, Bali protesting, Rama replied:
 

 Here there is the doctrine of “Killing no murder” put in the mouth of the very avatar of dharma.
 We may descend further and come to the time of Lord Krishna. Here we have the Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna is unwilling to kill those who are, after all, his nearest relations. Lord Krishna urges him to fight and ""kill"" and the doctrine of ahimsa is left in the background.
 One has thus to inquire whether there is a limit to the practice of ahimsa. A girl is being outraged. Is she not justified in killing the devil to escape from his clutches? Is she to observe non-violence?
 Catching fish is violence. Uprooting plants for use as vegetable is violence. Use of disinfectants for germs of disease is violence. How to live?
 A Brahmin
 If the father had not milked the unwilling buffalo, the world will have lost nothing. There are many things put in the mouth of Rama by Tulsidas which I do not understand. The whole episode about Bali is of that type. The literal application of the lines attributed to Rama by Tulsidas will land the doer in trouble if it will not send him to the gallows. Everything related of every hero in Ramayana or Mahabharata I do not take literally, nor do I take these books as historical records. They give us essential truths in a variety of ways. Nor do I regard Rama and Krishna as portrayed in the two poems as infallible beings. They reflect the thoughts and aspirations of their ages. Only an infallible person can do justice to the lives of infallible beings. One can therefore only take the spirit of these great works for
 
 only guidance, the letter will smother one and stop all growth. So far as the Gita is concerned, I do not regard it as a historical discourse. It takes a physical illustration to drive home a spiritual truth. It is the description not of a war between cousins but between the two natures in us—the good and the evil. I would suggest to “A Brahmin” an examination of the doctrine of ahimsa apart from the incidents he quotes. Ahimsa paramo dharmah is one of the highest truths of life. Any fall from it must be regarded as a fall. Euclid’s straight line may not be capable of being drawn on a blackboard. But the impossibility of the task cannot be permitted to alter the definition. Judged by that test even the uprooting of a plant is an evil. And who does not feel a pang on plucking a beautiful rose? That we do not feel a pang on plucking a weed does not affect the doctrine. It shows that we do not know the place of weeds in nature. Therefore all injury is a violation of the doctrine of ahimsa. The fullest application of ahimsa  does make life impossible. Then, let the truth remain though we may all perish. The teachers of old have carried the doctrine to its logical extent and laid down that the physical life is  an  evil,  an embarrassment. Moksha is a bodyless superphysical state in which there is neither drinking nor eating and therefore neither the milking of buffalo nor the plucking even of a weed. It may be difficult for us to grasp or appreciate the truth, it may be and is impossible fully to live up to it. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that it is the truth. And virtue lies in regulating our lives in accordance with it and to the best of our ability. A true perception is half the battle.  Life  becomes livable and lovable only to the extent that we apply the grand doctrine in actual practice. For then we hold the flesh in bondage rather than live in perpetual bondage to the flesh.

   KOHAT  
 [March 19, 1925]
 I  am  able  only  now  to   publish   my   statementlibtech_587_footnoteand   that   of Maulana Shaukat Ali on the Kohat tragedy. It was not possible to do so earlier as both Maulana Shaukat Ali and I have been travelling and not staying at the same place. I am not sure that the publication at this
 
 juncture of our statements on the tragedy can do any tangible good except in so far as the fulfilment of a promise must do in any case. The publication will, however, do one indirect good.There are material differences between us on the inferences we have drawn from the same facts. There are differences too in the degree of reliance we have placed upon the evidence given to us by witnesses. When  we discovered the differences between us we both felt grieved and tried to come nearer each other. We even referred our differences to Hakim Saheb and Dr. Ansari for our guidance. Fortunatley, Pandit Motilalji was present at our discussion. We could find nothing in the discussion to induce us to make any radical alteration in our view- points. These discussions took place at Delhi. We then decided to travel together a few hours to re-examine ourselves and to see whether we could remodel our statements. Beyond making some altera-tions we were not able to come nearer. We also examined the suggestion made by Hakim Saheb and supported to an extent by Pandit Motilalji not to publish the statements. But we, or at least I, came to the conclusion that the public which had hitherto known the Ali Brothers and me to be always in agreement about so many public things should know that we too might differ on some matters, but without suspecting each other of conscious bias or wilful perversion of facts and  without mutual affection being in any way affected. Our open acknowled- gment of our differences will be an object-lesson in mutual toleration. Let the public know that neither the Maulana Saheb nor I have spared pains to come near each other. But there was no desire for suppression of opinion. We have made alterations in our original drafts. But in no case has either party surrendered his confirmed opinions. We have each softened expressions here and there so as not to wound susceptibilities. But beyond that the originals have  not  suffered material alterations.
   MR. 	GANDHI’S 	STATEMENT  M. K. G.    TIRUPUR,  March 	19, 1925 
  	Maulana Shaukat Ali and I went to Rawalpindi on the 4th February to 	meet the Hindu refugees and the Mussalmans of Kohat to whom the 	Maulana had written and who were excepted to come to Rawalpindi. 	Lala Lajpat Rai followed a day later. But unfortunately he came with 	a predisposition to fever and was laid up in bed the whole 
 of the time we were in Rawalpindi.
 Of the Mussalmans Maulvi Ahmad Gul and Pir Saheb Kamal were the principal parties whose evidence we took. The Hindus had their written and printed statements to which they  had  nothing  to add. The Muslim Working Committee which is functioning in Kohat did not and would not come. They sent a wire to Maulana Saheb saying:
 A reconciliation has already been effected between Hindus and Muslims. In our opinion this question should not be reopened. The Muslims should therefore be excused for not sending their representatives to Rawalpindi.
Maulvi Ahmad Gul and another gentleman who came to
 Rawalpindi with him were members of the Working Committee but they said they came not as such but as members of the Khilafat Committee.
 It was difficult to come to any conclusions on details without a thorough examination on the spot and without examining many more witnesses. This, however, we could not do. We could not go to Kohat nor was it our purpose to rake up the whole controversy again by going into minute details. Our purpose was to bring together the two parties if it was at all possible. We therefore confined ourselves to elucidating the main facts.
 As I am writing this without a detailed consultation with the Maulana Saheb, I state my own conclusions, leaving him either to confirm mine or to state his own.
 The causes of the events of the 9th September and after were many. Among these was the resentment felt by the Mussalmans over the resentment felt in their turn by the Hindus over the conversions (so-called in my opinion) of Hindus—men and married women, and consequent steps taken by them, the Hindus. The desire of the parachas (Mussalman traders of Kohat) to oust the Hindus of Kohat was  another.libtech_588_footnotelibtech_589_footnoteThe  resentment  felt   over   the   alleged   abduction   by Sardar Makhan Singh’s son of a married Mussalman girl was the third.libtech_590_footnote
The cumulative effect of these causes was to create great tension
between the two communities. The immediate cause that lighted the
 
 conflagration was a poem in the notorious pamphlet published by Mr. Jiwandas, Secretary, Sanatan Dharma Sabha at Rawalpindi, and imported by him into Kohat. It contained a number of bhajans or poems in praise of Shri Krishna and Hindu-Muslim unity. But it also contained the one in question. It was a highly offensive poem, undoubtedly calculated to wound Muslim susceptibility. Mr. Jiwandas was not the author. He did not import the pamphlet in order to irritate the Mussalmans. As soon as the matter was brought to the notice of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha, it sent a written apology to the Mussal- mans for the offending poem and removed it from the unsold copies. This might have satisfied the Mussalmans, but it did not. The unsold copies, over 500 according to Mussalman testimony and over 900 according to Hindu testimony, were brought to the Town Hall and publicly burnt in the presence of the Assistant Commissioner and a large concourse of Mussalmans. The cover of the pamphlet contained a portrait of Shri Krishna. Mr. Jiwandas was arrested. This took place on the 3rd September, 1924. He was to be brought before the Court on the 11th. The Hindus tried to avoid the Court proceedings and to settle the matter amicably. A Khilafat deputation, too, came from Peshawar for the purpose. The Mussalmans wanted to  try Mr. Jiwandas according to Shariat. The Hindus declined but offered to submit to the award of the Khilafatists. The negotiations fell through. The Hindus, therefore, applied for discharge of Mr. Jiwandas. He was released on the 8th September under security and under instructions to leave Kohat. He did leave Kohat immediately. This anticipation of the date of trial enraged the Mussalmans. During the night of the 8th September they held an excited meeting at which fiery speeches were made. It was resolved to approach the Deputy Commissioner in a body and to demand the re-arrest of Mr. Jiwandas and the arrest of certain other members of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha. Reprisals  against the Hindus were threatened if the Deputy Commissioner did not listen to the demand. Messages were sent out to the neighbouring villages to join the assembly in the morning. About two thousand angry Mussalmans, according to Pir Kamal, marched to the Town Hall. The request of the Deputy Commissioner that a samll party from among the assembly should see him in the Town Hall was rejected and he was compelled to face the vast crowd outside. He yielded to the demand and the elated crowd dispersed.
 The Hindus had become nervous through fright during the preceding week. On the 6th of September they sent a letter to the
 Deputy Commissioner informing him of the prevailing excitement among the Mussalmans. But no precautions were taken by him for their safety. They were aware of the proceedings of  the  meeting during the night of the 8th. They therefore sent in the morning of the 9th telegrams notifying the authorities of their fears and requesting them not to re-arrest Jiwandas. The latter still took no notice. There is a hot dispute as to what the crowd did after dispersal near the Town Hall. The Mussalman version is that the Hindus fired the first shot killing a Mussalman boy and wounding another, that this infuriated the mob resulting in the burning and looting that took place that day. The Hindu version is that the first shot was fired by the Mussalmans, that they, the Hindus, fired afterwards and in self-defence and that the whole of the looting and burning was according to a pre-arranged plan and after pre-arranged signals.
 There is no direct evidence on the point and I am unable to reach a definite conclusion. The Mussalmans contend that no damage would have occurred if the Hindus had not fired the first shot. I am unable to accept the contention. In my opinion some damage was bound to be done, whether the Hindus had fired or not.
 It is certain to me that Sardar Makhan Singh’s suburban residence was burnt and its garden damaged by the crowd before the firing, no matter from which side it was begun. But there is no doubt that the Hindus did fire and kill or wound some Mussalmans at some stage or other. My opinion is that the crowd elated by its success dispersed itself in several directions and made hostile demonstrations in front of Hindu houses or shops. I should not be surprised if the Hindus who, as shown above, were already nervous and  were expecting trouble, took fright at the demonstration and fired in order to scare away the mob. But such an attitude of resistance  would infuriate the Mussalmans who were unused to resistance on the part of Hindus. For as Pir Kamal said, the Frontier Mussalmans regarded themselves as Nayaks (protectors) and the Hindus as Hamsayas (here meaning protected). The more, therefore, the Hindus showed resistance the greater became the fury of the mob.
 To me, then, who fired the first shot has not much significance for the purpose of the distribution of blame. No doubt, if the Hindus had not defended themselves at all or if they had not fired the first shot, assuming that they did, the Mussalman demonstration would have exhausted itself sooner. But such was not to be expected of the
 
 Hindus who were in possession of arms and knew more or less indifferently how to use them. Mussalman witnesses questioned Hindu deaths or even injury to Hindus on the 9th. I am, however, certain that several Hindus died or were wounded on the 9th at the hands of the Mussalmans. It is difficult to give the total number. It is a pleasure, however, to note here that some Mussalmans befriended the Hindus and gave them shelter.
 It is generally admitted that on the 10th September the Mussalman fury knew no bounds. No doubt highly exaggerated reports of Mussalman deaths at Hindu hands were spread and tribesmen from all parts stole into Kohat by making breaches in the walls and otherwise. Destruction of life and property, in which the constabulary freely partook, which was witnessed by the officials and which they could have prevented, was general. Had not the Hindus been withdrawn from their places and taken to the Cantonment, not many would have lived. Much has been made of the fact that Mussalmans too suffered and that tribesmen, once their passion for looting is let loose, make no distinction between Hindu property and Mussalman property. Whilst this statement is true, I do not believe that the Mussalmans have suffered in any way proportionate  to  the Hindus. And I must respectfully mention that even some Khilafat volunteers, whose duty it was to protect Hindus and regard them as their own kith and kin, neglected their duty and not only joined in the loot but also took part in the previous incitement.
 But the worst is yet to be related. During these days temples including a Gurdwara were damaged and idols broken. There were numerous    forced    conversionslibtech_591_footnotelibtech_592_footnote,    or    conversions    so-called,    i.e., conversions pretended for safety. Two Hindus at least were brutally murdered because they (the one certainly, the other inferentially) would not accept Islam. The so-called conversions are thus described by a Mussalman witness:
 The Hindus came and asked to have their shikhaslibtech_593_footnotecut and sacred threads destroyed, or the Mussalmans whom they approached for protection said they could be protected only by declaring themselves Mussalmans and removing
 
 the signs of Hinduism.
 I fear the truth is bitterer than is put here if I am to credit the Hindu version. I must say in fairness to the Mussalman friend that he did not regard these acts as conversions at all. Taking it at its lowest, the performance is humiliating alike for the Mussalmans and the Hindus. It would have redounded to the credit of the Mussalmans concerned, if they had steeled the hearts of the unmanly Hindus and offered them protection in spite of their remaining Hindus and retaining the symbols of Hindu-ism. The Hindus would have gone down to posterity as martyrs and heroes of whom mankind, let alone Hindus, would have been proud if they had preferred  death  to  denying their faith, albeit outwardly, in order to live.
 I must now say a word regarding the Government. The authorities on the spot betrayed callous indifference, incompetence and weakness.
 It was an error to have burnt the pamphlet after the offending poem was withdrawn.
 It was right to arrest Mr. Jiwandas in the first instance, but it was an error of judgment to have released him before the 11th.
It was criminal to have re-arrested him after release.
 It was criminal to have disregarded the warnings given by the Hindus on the 6th September and repeated on the 9th that their lives and property were in danger.
 It was criminal not to have offered protection when the riot eventually broke out.
 It was inhuman not to have provided the refugees with food after their removal and to have left them to their own resources after their removal to Rawalpindi.
 It was a gross neglect of their duty on the part of  the Government of India not to have appointed an impartial commission to inquire into the events and the conduct of the officials concerned.
 As to the future I am sorry that it is no brighter than the past. It is a matter of great pity that the Muslim Working Committee was not represented at our inquiry. The so-called reconciliation is a reconciliation brought about under threat of prosecution against both. It passes comprehension how a strong Government could be party to such a compromise. If it wanted to avoid prosecutions for fear of another demonstration on the part of the tribesmen, it should have
 
 boldly said so and declined to prosecute and then tried to bring about an amicable and honourable settlement between the parties.
 The compromise is intrinsically bad, because it makes no provision for restoration of lost and damaged property. It is also bad because it still involves prosecution of Mr. Jiwandas who is being made the scapegoat.
 It is therefore necessary, if there is to be real cleansing of hearts and genuine reconciliation, for the Mussalmans to invite the Hindu refugees and give them assurances of protection and help in reinstating their temples and Gurdwaras.
 But the most important assurance that should be given is, that in future no conversions are to take place except in the presence of the elders of the communities and except in the cases of those who understand the full meaning of what they are doing; and if such conversions are attempted they should recieve no recognition. I would personally like the stopping of all conversions and shuddhis. One’s faith is a personal matter with oneself. It is open to any person of mature age to change his or her faith when and as often as he or she wishes. But if I could do so, I would stop all propaganda except through one’s conduct. Conversion is a matter of heart and reason. An appeal to heart and reason can only be made through conduct. I am unable to conceive genuine conversions on the Frontier where Hindus live purely for purposes of gain and where they, a hopeless minority untrained in the use of arms, live in the midst of an overwhelming majority who are, moreover, by far their superiors in bodily strength and use of arms. The temptation for a weak man in such circumstances to embrace Islam for worldly gain is irresistible.
 Whether such assurances are forthcoming or not, whether a genuine change of heart is possible or not, I am quite clear on the course that should be adopted. Whilst this foreign domination is in existence some contact with it somewhere is inevitable. But all voluntary contact must be avoided wherever possible. This is the way to feel independent and to cultivate independence. And when a large number feels independent we are ready for swaraj. I can only suggest solutions of questions in terms of swaraj. I would therefore sacrifice present individual gain for future national gain. Even if Mussalmans refuse to make approaches and even if the Hindus of Kohat may have to lose their all, I should still say that they must not think of returning to Kohat till there is complete reconciliation between them and the Mussalmans, and until they feel that they are able to live at peace with
 the latter without the protection of the British bayonet. But I know that this a counsel of perfection and not likely to be followed by the Hindus. Nevertheless, I can tender no other advice. For me it is the only practical advice I can give. And if they cannot appreciate it, they must follow their own inclination. They are the best judges of their own capacity. They were in Kohat not as nationalists. They want to return not as nationalists but for the purpose of regaining their possessions. They will therefore do what to them seems feasible and advantageous. Only they must not try to do two things at a time—to try to follow my advice and at the same time to negotiate with the Government for terms. I know that they are not non-co-operators. They have ever relied upon British help. I can but point out consequences and leave them to choose their course.
My advice to the Mussalmans is equally simple.
 There was no cause for offence at the Hindus feeling perturbed at the so-called conversions or Hindu husbands  taking  means  to regain lost wives.
 I know that in spite of the discharge of Sardar Makhan Singh’s son upon the charge of abduction, many Mussalmans continue to believe in the guilt of the Sardar’s son. But assuming the guilt of the young Sardar, his crime was no warrant for the fearful vengeance wreaked upon a whole community.
 The importation of the pamphlet containing the highly offensive poem was undoubtedly bad, especially in a place like Kohat. But the Sabha made enough reparation by its apology. It  was,  however, held insufficient by the Mussalmans, and the Sanatan Sabha was compelled to make further reparation by the burning  of  the copies of the whole pamphlet including the portrait of Shri Krishna. Everything done thereafter to the Hindus was far in excess of the requirements. As I have said before, I am not sure who fired the first shot; but assuming that the Hindus did it, it was done in panic and in self-protection and therefore excusable even if not justifiable, and that the reprisals taken were wholly unwarranted. Therefore it is the Mussalmans who owe them such reparation as is possible in the circumstances. They, the Mussalmans, need no Government protection or aid against the Hindus. The latter can do them no harm even if they wished. But here again I am on unsafe ground. I do not possess even the honour of an acquaintance with the present advisers of the Mussalmans of Kohat. They must therefore be the best judges of what is good for the Mussalmans and good for India.
 If both the parties desire Government intervention my services are perfectly useless as I do not believe in the desirability of seeking such intervention and I could take no part in any negotiations with the Government. Whilst the Hindus are entitled to and must claim fair treatment from the Mussalmans, both need to protect themselves against the Government whose policy it is to set the one against the other. The Frontier is a non-regulation province where the will of an official is the law. It should be the pride of the Hindus and the Mussalmans to co-operate with one another to achieve full representative government. Such cannot be the case unless the two communities can trust one another and the desire is common to both.

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO RAILWAY 		LABOURERS’ ADDRESS, PODANUR  
 March 19, 1925
 Mahatmaji in reply said he was pleased to hear that all races were living together in perfect amity and goodwill and that they had no problem of untouchability or Hindu-Muslim problem. He exhorted the labourers to spin half an hour daily for the sake of the country and wear khaddar. If Maulana Shaukat Ali had been with him, he would have been glad to hear that there was no inter-communal strife among the labourers. Concluding, Mahatmaji advised the labourers to eradicate the drink evil.

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO MUNICIPAL 		ADDRESS, TIRUPUR  
 March 19, 1925
FRIENDS,
 I am very much obliged to you for all these addresses. I am sorry that the last address from my Mussalman friends I have not been able to understand for want of translation, but I presume that it contains very much the same sentiments that are contained in  the other addresses. You will share my sorrow that this time the Ali Brothers or one of them is not with me; owing to their preoccupations
 in Delhi and Bombay, it was not possible for any of them to accompany me.
 The municipal address calls this the khaddar capital and calls me the khaddar king. I am certainly flattered by the description given to me, and I do feel that if any place can be khaddar capital, Tirupur certainly desevres to be so called, but I am quite aware of my limitations. I realize what a poor khaddar king I must be. (Laughter.) For this khaddar capital shows no more than ten thousand spinning- wheels and one thousand looms. The sales do not amount to more than three lakhs and a half or thereabouts. When you realize what a khaddar king aspires after, you will realize what humility must cover him when he hears of these figures. I was told that although this district was capable of producing 50 lakhs worth of khaddar per year, this district could not be made to use more than ten per cent of khaddar and when I look about me in this meeting, you men and women, I realize how true that remark is.
 During my visits to the several khaddar stores in this town I was given this book of samples by the Khaddar Board Bhandar. I do not know if all of you know what Tirupur is capable of giving you in the shape of khaddar. You have here different kinds of checks. You have also a variety of colours. All the khaddar is by no means too thick for weaving in this climate. There are women here who are capable of spinning 20 counts and even finer counts. You can see here a variety of chintz also, and you can see spotless white khaddar calico, and those who like borders can also see from that distance a variety of border too. Yard for yard the price of this stuff is no doubt greater than the price of calico from Manchester, Japan or Bombay and Ahmedabad and when you compare the durability of this khaddar with the durability of the stuff that you get from Manchester, I am sure that you will find this khaddar cheaper than calico. I also present you with the universal experience of those who are habitually using khaddar that their tastes are so refined and become so simple that their clothing requirements are immediately reduced when they begin to use khaddar, and what is more, do you not owe it to those poor men and women who are living in this district that even though their wares may be a little dearer than what may be sent to you from Manchester or Japan, or even Bombay and Ahmedabad, you should prefer your wares to those foreign wares? Your love of the country must be of an
 indifferent character if you neglect your neighbours, though all are your neighbours, [for] your distant neighbours of the Punjab, even though the Punjab may be in India. If everyone of you will look after his or her immediate neighbours, you will realize that there will be no difficulty and there will be no distress in India. All of you are agreed that this message of khaddar is an inestimable message. I therefore ask every one of you to immediately adopt khaddar if you have not done so already; and I ask you also to reinstate the spinning-wheel in every home here, for unless hundreds and thousands take to voluntary spinning, it will not be possible for us to reach that fineness in yarn which we want to realize, and unless we take to voluntary spinning, it will not be possible for us to cheapen khaddar as we are able to, and it was because of the immense possibility of the spinning-wheel that I ventured to suggest to every Congressman that the franchise should include the spinning test. I had the pleasure of seeing so many of our sisters at the spinning-wheel today.
I have visited also the weavers of a model village. If you had
 seen these women working at the spinning-wheel, and if you had seen what happiness the spinning-wheel had brought to their homes, you will soon be converted to the message of khaddar. I understand that for want of your patronage the Khaddar Board is unable to engage thousands of women spinners. I ask the Municipal Councillors, I ask you, the citizens of this place, to visit these centres and realize the truth of what I am saying for yourselves.
 I am glad that you are not pestered with the problem of untouchability or unapproachability as some other parts of the South, but I do hope that such untouchability or unapproachability as may still be lurking in our midst will be eradicated without the slightest hesitation. I am convinced this is no part of Hinduism.
 The third thing, I have said times without number, is Hindu- Muslim unity. It is impossible to reach the fullest height that this nation is capable of unless we realize the value of the unity of all the races living in our midst. And the fourth is temperance. Throughout my wanderings in Cochin and Travancore, it was pressed upon me that the drink evil was destroying many a home. If the population in this district is given to the drink habit, I hope you will tackle that problem also. (Loud and continued cheers.)

   SPEECH AT VILLAGERS’ MEETING PUDUPALAYAM  
 March 21, 1925
FRIENDS,
 It gives me very great pleasure to be able to meet you all in this out-of-the-way place, and on seeing the musical instruments here, I wished to hear some of your songs in your own natural way. I know that songs play an important part in the development of national life. But there is song and song and there is all the difference between different varieties. There is song that ennobles and there is song that degrades; and when you get a real, good song full of devotion and fervour, it ennobles. Such are some of our old songs all over India. In days of old, we had our own string instruments, but today the harmonium has displaced those noble instruments. I wish that  we could revert to the stringed instruments. They produce  a deeper melody and so far as I am concerned they have a far more soothing effect on me than a harmonium.
 When I look at all of you and all these sisters who have come here, I find the majority of them have foreign cloth on. Now I would like you for a few minutes to consider what the wearing of foreign cloth means. Not more than a hundred years ago, every one of our ancestors—men and women—had a spinning-wheel in their homes. And just as toda we have got a kitchen and a cooking stove in every house, so had we a spinning-wheel in every house at which the women spun. The village weavers wove the yarn that our sisters spun; and we clothed ourselves that way. Now if everyone spends for himself, say, Rs. 8 per year, for his clothing and supposing this village had a population of 5,000, we would have saved Rs. 40,000 a year. Today we are sending nearly Rs. 40,000 from our own village to Manchester or to Japan or to Bombay. In every case it is bad.
 In ancient times, we were doing what was right and what was good for our country and which kept our country away from hunger. Now we have changed it; the result is, when there is famine here we do not know what to do. I would like you, therefore, everyone to take a vow never henceforth to wear anything but khadi—hand-spun and hand-woven.
I would ask you also, those of you who have not already introd-
uced a  spinning-wheel in your homes, to  do  so.   That  will  be  our
Kamadhenu. I observe with the greatest pleasure, our friend Mr. Ratn-
 asabhapathy Gounderlibtech_594_footnotelibtech_595_footnotehas introduced not one but many   spinning- wheels in his family. It was for me a noble sight to see the ladies of his household spinning away, when I had the pleasure of visiting  his house yesterday. He has his cloth woven out of the yarn thus spun. He and his people were clothed in khaddar from top to toe. God has given him plenty of money and it was not for the sake of money he took up the spinning-wheel and wears khaddar. But he has done it for the sake of his country and for the sake of his religion. But we who are poor should do the thing for our own sake.
 Now a gentleman has given me some money to buy food and distribute it among the poor. I do not believe in distribution of food among even the poorest of men, if they have strong arms wherewith to earn their living. Nor do I believe in distributing robes when the people can work for them. In my opinion, our rich men practise wrong philanthropy when they indiscriminately distribute money among poor people, by which they merely want to please their fancy. Such charity is to be reserved only for those who are disabled, who are lame or blind or otherwise incapable of doing work.
 Therefore, in consultation with Sjt. C. Rajagopalachariar, I have come to the conclusion that this money might be used for distri- buting cloth to the poor people in this village or in this audience, at a rate lower than the bazaar rate. Ordinarily, I must confess that yard for yard, the khaddar we can produce today is dearer than the cloth sold in the bazaar; and many poor people tell me that they would gladly wear khaddar if it is sold at the same rate as in the bazaar. Therefore, I make this offer to you that those of you who are really poor and cannot pay much money, will register their names and take a promise that they would henceforth wear khaddar only and they will be supplied with khaddar at a cheaper price than in the bazaar. And if there are more poor people here than can be supplied by the donation now on hand, I will see to it that I get a bigger donation, provided all of you present here, promise to wear khaddar only. Now, that is the good thing we have given up, but which we must now restore. And I must talk to you about the bad thing we are refusing to give up.
 That bad thing is untouchability. It is one of the greatest curses which is damaging our country and our religion. Claiming to be a sanatani Hindu, I tell you our religion does not countenance untouchability as we practise it today. Untouchability I hold is a sin, if
 
 Bhagavad Gita is one of our Divine Books. There are only four varnas or castes, not five. There are undoubtedly some verses in the smritislibtech_596_footnotelibtech_597_footnote, which refer to untouchability, but not to the untouchability of today. That untouchability is applicable to certain occupations and certain states—temporary states. When my mother or sister or wife has the monthly sickness, I may not touch her while the sickness lasts. When my mother cleans her other smaller children, she is an untouchable till she bathes; and so is the scavenger who cleans my closet an untouchable until he has cleaned himself after cleaning the closet. Untouchability is a temporary state to be practised only in connection with such occupations which involve dirty work. But it is a crime and a sin to regard a person as untouchable because he is born in a particular community. And after all, what the Shastras require of you and me is that we should bathe when we touch  a  particular person. But the untouchability of today has degraded a fifth of the race. It carries with it the suppression of our own countrymen. It has set up a system of superiority and inferiority. The so-called caste Hindus, Brahmins and non-Brahmins, treat the untouchables, the Panchamalibtech_598_footnotelibtech_599_footnotecaste, with contempt and derision. They sinfully give them bad, dirty food. They sinfully refuse to let them use public roads. They sinfully degrade them in every way imaginable.
 I venture to say that there is absolutely no warrant in our scriptures for such inhuman treatment of our fellow-beings. It is contrary to humanity, it is contrary to the religion we profess—the religion of ahimsa—to say that caste Hindus may not serve an untouchable who is bitten by a snake or scorpion. On the contrary, my religion, the Hindu religion, teaches me that if I see my son and an untouchable side by side bit by a snake and I am given the option of saving first the untouchable or my son, it is my bounden duty to save the untouchable in preference to my son. God will never forgive me if  I forsake that untouchable boy. There is no other way of self- realization, except the way of complete self-abandonment. I ask you, therefore, to shed this bad habit, no matter for how many years we have been practising it.
 The third thing is the drink curse. I know that many in this southern Presidency are given to this drink habit. Everyone in this,
 
 
 who is given to the drink habit, will, I hope, give it up completely. Drink makes a man forget himself. He ceases to be a man for the time being. He becomes less than a beast. He loses control over his tongue and every other limb. It never does the slightest good. I  hope, therefore, that you will combat the drink evil with all your strength.
 Now it is in order to combat the disease of untouchability and the disease of drink and in order to introduce people to take to  khaddar and to the spinning-wheel that Sjt. C. Rajagopalachariar has planted himself in your midst.
 He has a band of able, intelligent, self-sacrificing, young men to assist him. Sjt. Gounder has placed at his disposal his  beautiful  garden. They have left, all of them, their remunerative callings and have come in order to serve you. Already, within a few months’ time, hundreds of spinning-wheels have been revived. Several hundreds of women are receiving cotton from week to week. They turn it into yarn and bring it from week to week and take away money for their yarn. That yarn is woven and is at your disposal in the shape of khadi. But he and the few men he has, cannot render you much assistance unless you co-operate with him. This is a poor district suffering from famine for the last three or four years and I assure you that there is no insurance so effective as the spinning-wheel against famine.
 And you can help in a variety of ways. Those of you who are fairly well-to-do and cannot spare much money can spare half an hour daily to spinning. You can learn carding and spinning at the Ashram here, take sufficient cotton from week to week, turn it into yarn and deliver that yarn free to the Ashram. That will enable Sjt. Rajagopalachariar to sell khadi at a lower cost than today. Those of you who cannot afford to give cotton may give cash. The Ashram is public property. You have a right to see it at any time you like. It is in your midst. And so long as you find that its activity is a helpful activity and serves your district, it is your bounden duty to help it in every way.
 After the close of the address, Sjt. Rajagopalachariar invited the poor, who promised to boycott foreign cloth and wear only khaddar, to register their names at the Ashram, when they would be supplied with khaddar at a price cheaper than the bazaar price of mill-cloth.

   SPEECH AT ASHRAM, PUDUPALAYAMlibtech_600_footnote  
 March 21, 1925 I have read the translation of the address very  carefully. Naturally my sympathies are entirely with you. It was at Cocanada that
for the first time I came into touch with this class of people and ever
 since that time, I have been deeply interested in their problems and difficulties. It is a very horrible thing what we are practising everyday in the name of religion. I agree that it is very difficult to solve the problem so long as there are men who are willing to tamper with the chastity of women and so long as there are women ready to sell away their honour for the sake of money. So long as there are such people, so long will this go on. But one thing we can do is to bring discredit on this profession and destroy the air of respectability which it now has. We must rob it of every vestige of respectability. That we shall do by mercilessly condemning the custom.
 I would advise you to take census of every  family  in  which the custom of setting apart a girl for prostitution exists. We must persuade these people to consider such a course as absolutely wrong. Secondly, we must take up the case of these unfortunate women and find them suitable employment. I discussed this matter for over two hours with such classes of women in Barisal, Bengal.libtech_601_footnoteThe income of these women is large; we cannot promise them the same income in their alternative professions as they are getting from their sinful practice; nor would they require such an income if they lead  a reformed life. Spinning may not secure a living for them. They could take to it only as a recreation, as a sacrificial practice. I place it before them only as purification. But other occupations can be found for them which they can easily learn and follow. There is  weaving, tailoring or fancy-work on khaddar. Some Parsi women have taken to fancy weaving. There is also lace-work, embroidery and other handicrafts which can easily yield them an income of three quarter of a rupee to one and a half rupees per day. The  Devadasilibtech_602_footnotelibtech_603_footnoteclass being small, it must not be a difficult matter to find five or six handicrafts for them. We require men and women —preferably women who have
 
 
 been trained in these handicrafts and lead a pure life—to take up this cause of reformation of their fallen sisters. You may also study and copy the institutions with similar objects working in other  places. There should be a specialist to devote his life to this nobel work of reclamation.
 After the close of the reply, there was an interesting incident when Mahatmaji solicited and got the earrings and finger-ring of Lakshmana Mudaliar for public work and presented them back to Mr. Lakshmana Mudaliar himself to form the nucleus of a fund to be raised and devoted for the reform of the Devadasis.

   SPEECH IN REPLY TO WELCOME 		ADDRESSES, TIRUCHENGODElibtech_604_footnote  
     FRIENDS, March 	21, 1925 
  	I thank you for all these addresses. I note that you endorse my 	activities in connection with khaddar. The more I think of the 	possibilities of the spinning-wheel and khadi, the more certain I 	feel that it is the only thing which can solve the problem of the 	deep distress which has overtaken our land. And as I saw this 	morning at the Ashram, old women and old men streaming in, and as I 	saw old women being served with cotton, I felt millions of men and 	women like this had and could have no other occupation than the 	spinning- wheel. If it were not for our self-satisfaction with our 	own lot and happiness so called, the contemplation of the paupe-rism 	of India would make life a terrible burden to us. Just picture to 	ourselves an India with a whole one-tenth of her population living 	on merely one meal a day, living on a bread and a pinch of salt, and 	you will have some conception of the poverty prevailing in India. It 	is not a picture drawn from my imagination but it is a statement 	based on facts collected by the inexhaustible energy of the Grand 	Old Man of India, Dadabhai Naoroji. It was he who first introduced 	us to the statistics that were prepared by English administrators 	and from these statistics he showed that India was daily growing 	poorer and poorer.  	Now, the remedy for removing the distress lies in our  own  hands. 	We are responsible for the distress. We gave up the use of cloth    
 that was woven by our own weavers out of yarn spun by millions of our own sisters. We chose to adopt the calico from Manchester, Japan and lately from Bombay and Ahmedabad. And in doing so, we did not care a straw as to what happened to our own neighbours. We did not stop to think that the use of calico from mills, no matter where they were situated, deprived the poor labourers who were devoted to agriculture of the profit they received from working during  their  spare hours. It was a crime for which we have paid heavily and we are still paying heavily. But happily it is not yet too late. If only we will cease to be callous and indifferent to the sufferings of our own countrymen and countrywomen, we can adopt the remedy today and help to remove the poverty from our land.
 I have been visiting the khaddar centres in the South and I have been told that if the people of this Presidency were to patronize or rather do their duty by the people by buying khaddar, thousands of these men and women would get a few coppers more into  their pockets. Everywhere they complain they are obliged to turn away the women that flock to them for cotton because they are unable to sell all the khaddar they produce. I plead with you, therefore, every one of the men and every one of the women who are able to hear my voice, that you would speedily remove all the mill-made cloth you wear and put on khaddar which will help your poor sisters and brothers. It is the highest service you can render to your motherland. If you will only be good enough to be satisfied with the khaddar produced here, you will be able to serve your country and in order that we can reach the fineness of yarn which is necessary to produce fine khaddar and in order that we can issue khaddar to rich and poor at cheap rates almost comparable to Manchester cloth, I would request you to devote half- an-hour daily to the spinning-wheel. It is an incredibly simple and certain solution of the problem which has been engaging the attention of the best of our countrymen for a generation. You are unable now to complain of want of means to learn spinning or secure khaddar. You have now in your midst an Ashram established which is devoting the whole of the energy of some of the best of the youth of our country to the propagation of khaddar. You have but to walk there and you can have your spinning lessons for nothing, you can have good spinning-wheels and you can have khaddar to your heart’s satisfaction.
Equally important is the question of untouchability if we are to
serve our religion. I am not tired of repeating that untouchability is a
 curse. As we practise it today, it has no warrant in our scriptures. It is contrary to humanity and reason. It is a denial of God. God never made man that he may consider another man as an untouchable. I do not ask you to dine with anybody, I do not ask you to give your daughters to anybody you do not like, but I do ask you not to treat anybody as untouchable merely because he is born in a particular community. God will cease to be God if he brought to being a single person with the hall-mark of inferiority. Go to the Ashram, look at the Panchama boys who are brought up there and I defy you to be able to distinguish between the Panchama boys and other Brahmin or caste Hindu boys there. A little touch of kindness, a little touch of humanity and love has made them one flesh with everyone else in that Ashram. They are as intelligent, as attentive and as lovable as any single one in the Ashram. They are as clean and as godfearing as the highest Brahmin in the Ashram. Let us therefore shed our arrogance and save Hinduism from the destination that is impending, if we do not take warning betimes.
 The problem of drink is another problem which awaits instant solution. It is destroying many a home and I hope those of you who are patriotic, who consider yourselves as servants of the country, will bestir themselves and go into the midst of those given to the drink evil and try to convert them. Copy the noble example of Mr. Ratnas- abhapathy Gounder and do what he is doing in order to save the country from being ruined by the drink curse. It gave me joy and comfort to find his cousin brother only a few months ago making a solemn vow to me that he would throw himself heart and soul into temperance and khaddar work. It gave me the greatest joy to see his wife spinning away at the wheel. She needed no money. She spins for the sake of the country. But I ask every man and woman to spin from today.
 I thank you once more for your address and I hope you will bear what I have ventured to say in mind and carry out these three things as best as you can.

 APPENDICES
 APPENDIX I
 
M. N. ROY ON BOLSHEVISM
 Some of his American friends wrote Mahatma Gandhi that, in the name of religion, he was probably introducing Bolshevism into India. These gratuitous “friends” obviously taking their cue from the spokesmen of Anglo-Saxon Imperialism (who often masquerade as pacifists), depict the revolt of the Moslem peoples as a menace to the world, because this revolt is supported by Bolshevik Russia. It should have been very simple for Mahatmaji to give a fitting reply to this impudent communication. He could have told his “responsibly (?) foreign friends” that the Moslem peoples have legitimate reason to revolt, and that any political doctrine or government supporting this revolt is to be considered favourably by all apostles of freedom. Besides, he could have requested his American friends to get busy  at home, if they sincerely dreaded any menace to the world. What is menacing the world more today than American Imperialism? Is the revolt of the Moslem people more sinister than the Ku-Klux-Klan and the American Legion? Is Bolshevist atheism more godless than the anti-Asiatic spirit of the American democracy?
 The Mahatma, however, did not give such a direct answer. He preferred to justify himself—to absolve himself from any possible suspicion of Bolshevist tendency. But the curious thing is, that although by his own confession he did not know anything about Bolshevism, nevertheless he was extremely solicitous to disown any leaning towards it, so sure is his instinctive antipathy for it. In an article in Young India he writes: “In the first place I must confess that I do not know the meaning of Bolshevism.” This is indeed a very damaging confession, in view of the fact that it is made by one standing at the head of a great popular movement. The Mahatma said in the same article that he knew that there were two opposite pictures of Bolshevism, “one painting it in the blackest colour, the other hailing it as a deliverance for the downtrodden masses all the world over.” But he does not know what to believe. Here again he could follow a simple human course. He could easily find out who paints the first picture. It is done by those who are ruling over the world with the policy of blood and iron. In deference to his scruples of impartiality, he might not believe those giving the second picture; but certainly Mahatmaji does need to be convinced that the first party is not the friend or deliverer of the human race. Therefore when they depict a thing in the blackest colour, the oppressed section of humanity can instinctively sense some sinister motive, they feel that the “blackest colour” is for deceiving them. By this unerring instinct, Indian nationalists during
 the War used to read two German victories in the place of each allied victory cabled by Reuter, and the Mexican peon calls himself proudly a Bolshevik, for the simple reason that the American capitalists are so much against Bolshevism. But I suppose, the mentality of a Mahatma is too complicated an organism to admit of such a simple instinctive process.
 Since the deplorable ignorance of Bolshevism is not the Mahatma’s alone, but is shared by many in India, and since this ignorance does not preclude them from forming an opinion on the subject, it may not be uncalled for to say a few words about this “monstrous” doctrine. It is the more called for, in view of the fact  that  Bolshevism (which, by the way, is not the result, as is commonly believed, but the basic principle of the Russian Revolution of 1917) is the most dominant political factor of the contemporary world. Just as the great French Revolution of 1789 affected the political thought and life of Europe at that epoch, the Russian Revolution is bound to play the same role in our time, with the difference that the geographical situation of Russia, coupled with the principles of her revolution, will bring wider spheres, including Asia and Africa, under its sway. This is the case, despite the explicable apprehension and righteous indignation of the pacifically minded ladies and gentlemen, whose good faith is taken for granted by Mahatmaji, but is seriously doubted by more practical men of the world.
 Now, as far as Mahatmaji is concerned, the main principles of Bolshevism will not be anything new. He himself will think so. But principles become a bundle  of dead formulas if they are not put into action. By his own declaration, the Mahatma desires to see the masses freed from the domination of capitalism. Well, Bolshevism does not propose anything more monstrous. The Bolsheviks are generally in agreement with Mahatmaji when he says, “the greatest menace to the world today is the growing, exploiting, irresponsible imperialism which is threatening the independent existence and expansion of the weaker races.” But the difference between Mahatmaji and the Bolsheviks is that in the hands of the former, this gospel of freedom loses all practical value, being subordinated to an intricate conception of morality, religion and God, while the latter do not permit their vision to be clouded by illusions, and deal with the world as it is. The result is, that while Bolshevism forges ahead, breaking one link after another of the mighty chain of time-honoured servitude, in the face of united and determined Opposition of the powers that be, Gandhism gropes in the dark, spinning out ethical and religious dogmas, that only prevent the masses from developing the will to fight for freedom.
 It can be taken for granted that Mahatmaji is acquainted with the general principles of Socialism; not the Utopian brand of St. Simon, Thomas More, Tolstoy, etc., but that formulated on the basis of scientific knowledge and economic facts by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The principles of Socialism are (1) to overthrow the
 capitalist system of production; (2) abolition of private property; (3) reorganization of the means of social production and distribution on the basis  of  communal ownership and (4) transformation of the class-ridden society into a human fraternity. These are also the principles of Bolshevism, the latter being Socialism in its militant and initial stages of victory.
 The term “Bolshevism” which has come to be associated with bloodshed, destruction, terror and what not, is very harmless in its meaning. It is derived from the Russian word bolsheviki, which is the synonym for the adherents of the majority. The term was first used when the Russian Socialist Democratic Labour Party split in 1903 into two factions on the questions of programme and tactics. The programme and tactics advocated by the majority, led by Lenin together with others, came to be known as Bolshevism; and since the Russian proletariat scored the victory in October 1917, having fought according to the programme and tactics advocated by the majority of the party ever since 1903, the October Revolution is called a Bolshevist victory, which means the first triumph of Socialism. What are the concrete results of the Russian Revolution? (1) A corrupt, irresponsible despotism was overthrown. (2) The bourgeoisie, which under the guise of democracy, sought in conjunction with foreign powers to deprive the Russian masses of the benefits of the Revolution, was also overthrown. (3) The landed aristocracy, the mainstay of the Czarist despotism, was destroyed, land declared to be the property of the entire nation and distributed among the cultivators. (4) Large industries were nationalized. (5) Foreign trade made a State monopoly. (6) All legislative and administrative power was transferred to the overwhelming majority of the people, namely, the workers, peasants and soldiers, who exercised this power through their councils (soviets). (7) All right of private property and the class privilege accruing therefrom was abolished. These in general are the principles of Bolshevism, applied practically in Russia in consequence of the Revolution. Now that he knows what Bolshevism is, what is the attitude of the Mahatma towards it? It will be interesting for India, as well as the whole world, to know the reply.
 Now comes the thorny question. Mahatmaji might not take exception to these principles, but he would certainly make many a stipulation as to the method of realizing them. For him there is only one touch-stone for everything. If Bolshevism  is atheistic, he is against it. That is all. Well, there we have given him a definition of Bolshevism in a nutshell. It is for him to pronounce whether it is a negation of God  or what. He cannot maintain that it is a negation of God, unless he holds private property and vested interests to be a divine ordinance, because Bolshevism is  certainly a negation of private property and vested interests, which from the dawn of civilization, have been the curse of human society. In the practical programme of Bolshevism there is no question of God or religion. It is neither theistic nor
 atheistic. It concerns the worldly life of man. The possible conflict with God and religion occurs only when the latter stands in the way; when the conception of God or religion clashes with this practical programme. In that case, Bolshevism does not hesitate to take up the challenge even of the supposed Almighty, and become atheistic, thus running the risk of forfeiting the approbation of the Mahatma. But by doing so, it not only becomes the champion of the material rights of the masses, but holds up as well the torch of intellectual and spiritual emancipation to dissipate the gloom of ignorance and superstition in which the masses have been kept for ages by the dominating class.
 The programme of Bolshevism, which Mahatmaji cannot deny to be humanitarian (unless he chooses to take up openly the cause of the upper class) is, however, not easily put into practice. The reign of terror and devastating civil war, that undeniably took place in Russia after the revolution, owe their origin to the fact that a brutal resistance was put up to prevent the realization of this programme. Not only the Russian aristocracy and bourgeoisie, who naturally frantically tried to regain their lost position, put up this resistance; they were openly backed by the international bourgeoisie, who saw in the Russian Revolution the first breach in their vital citadel. A part of this ceaseless campaign was the picturing of Bolshevism in the darkest colours, which did not altogether fail to impress even the Mahatma. Now what were the Bolsheviks to do in that situation? There were two alternatives: to call upon the Russian workers and peasants to be godfearing and meekly slip back into the bondage they had so heroically broken or to keep on fighting even against God anal religion, if they stood in the way, to protect and consolidate the freedom won. Bolshevism was obliged to accept the second alternative, because not only all available material forces were concentrated in order to force the Russian workers and peasants back under the capitalist and Czarist tyranny; all the arms of God and religion were also mobilized for the same purpose. Bolshevism is not a gospel of God: Bolshevists are not angels. But neither is Bolshevism the spirit of demons. The Mahatma proposes “to touch the masses through their hearts, their better nature” It is a fascinating proposition, to which Bolshvism would not object, had it been found workable in the practice of liberating the masses from class domination  and  imperialist oppression. His theory of “discipline” is also very questionable. It may be good for the spiritual well-being of the masses; but it certainly weakens their will  to fight for freedom. All these doctrines about “heart”, “better nature”, “discipline” and the like have been adumbrated from time immemorial by those who were the (perhaps unconscious) instruments of class domination. Bolshevism does not shirk any task, however disagreeable or difficult it may be. It challenges the existence of God and denounces all the codes of religion and ethics originating therefrom because in the struggle for freedom they are all found arrayed on the side of despotism, tyranny and oppression.
 Bolshevism is prepared to leave God alone, if He and His agents on earth agree not to meddle in things temporal. But if they do not agree to be satisfied with their super-material position and seek to make trouble on earth, Bolshevism will preach atheism to liberate the masses from the snare of ignorance woven by religion.

 APPENDIX II
 EXTRACT FROM C. RAJAGOPALACHARI’S COMMENT ON CHARKHA
 No-changers who feel that the salvation of the country, the permanent anchor of its hope, rests on the charkha, must not look up, on this side or that, but prayerfully carry the burden. There is no rest or fatigue for us. The wheel is our hope, our joy, our friend, our good angel. We must work for it in our waking hours, and dream about it when we sleep. I did not see fully the meaning of things at first. I therefore thought Mahatmaji went along paths where I saw no logic or light. But I now see things clearly, and hope all those who felt distracted by doubts like myself will also see. Spin, spin and spin and make others spin—this is our single mantra, our Gayatri.
 While I saw all this, I felt at the same time that there was some sort of unreality, some sort of political playing with truth, casting a shadow over all this plan of Satyagraha. But here I depend on judgement of the guru whose instinctive sense of Truth is so much greater than mine, and I feel at ease.
 
   Young 	India, 15-1-1925     APPENDIX III  C. 	R. 
    EXTRACT FROM 	DEWAN OF TRAVANCORE’S 	SPEECH ON VYKOM SATYAGRAHA  The 	third matter relates to the resolution that was moved by Mr. N. 	Kumaran recommending that the Government should throw open the roads 	around and in the vicinity of the Vykom temple to all classes. I 	propose to deal with this resolution at some length and explain the 	position of the Government. The custom prohibiting the use by 	certain communities of certain roads forms the basis of the Vykom 	satyagraha and has been the cause of considerable comment both in 	and outside Travancore. There are certain Hindu communities falling 	outside the fold of caste in Kerala, whose approach or touch has 	been, from time immemorial, unfortunately considered to carry 	pollution with it, both to the members of caste Hindu communities 	and to the deities 
 in the temples to which the latter communities have access. In consequence, these non-caste Hindu communities have not been allowed the use of roads lying within a certain distance from some Hindu temples even though such roads are public in the sense that they are open to certain classes of the public. The existence of this custom is admitted by the non-caste Hindus. The most important among the non-caste Hindu communities, so far as Travancore is concerned, are the Ezhavas, who constitute one- sixth of the entire population, and who have, within recent times, made rapid advance in education and in material prosperity. This community naturally feels that the prohibition is derogatory to its self-respect and it is a feeling with which every right-minded man is bound to sympathize. The case of the Ezhavas and their brethren has, as a matter of fact, secured a certain amount of sympathy from members of communities more fortunately circumstanced.
 The satyagraha movement at Vykom was started nearly a year ago by a band  of Ezhavas and their sympathizers to get this disability removed. The modus operandi of the movement consisted in the attempt to break through the long-established custom referred to above by entering the prohibited area, even though it meant wounding the religious susceptibilities of the caste Hindus, and by defying the orders  of the local Magistracy forbidding entry into the prohibited area, such orders having had to be passed to preserve the public peace threatened by the action of the non- caste Hindu communities. The aim of the satyagrahis is to force the hands of the Government to authorize by an executive order the violation of an established custom, which has received the recognition of the Travancore High Court  in a series of decisions commencing with the case in 5 T.L.R. and which is therefore the present law of the land.
 It is not the intention of the Government to justify the existence of this custom.  Some  may  call  it  prejudice  and  some  superstition.  But,  by  whatever name it may be called, the custom is there and has to be reckoned with. As I have already said, it is based upon religious belief; and, as you all know, such beliefs are dear to the people who hold them. Such customs based upon religious beliefs are not unknown in other parts of India. In the Madras Presidency, for example, non-caste Hindus are not permitted to use some of the public streets inhabited by caste Hindus, and an attempt to violate this custom in the Salem District led, within the last few months, to a riot attended with murder and in the Malabar District,  to a disturbance  of the public peace. Even among the non-caste communities, wells touched by some of them are not used by some others. In Upper India also similar customs are widely prevalent. It is the paramount duty of every Government not to interfere with the religious beliefs or usages based upon them, so long as they are not outrageously in- human. It is also the duty to the Government to preserve the public peace, and maintain the status quo ante. Every Executive Government is bound to maintain and
 carry out the laws as it exists and as it is interpreted by its courts of justice. This is what the Travancore Government have done, as pointed out by the Additional Head Sirkar Vakil at  the discussion  of the resolution in the  Legislative Council and  this is also the policy pursued by other Governments in India.
 Now let us examine the position at Vykom in some detail. The roads immediately surrounding the temple are the private property of the temple and are not public roads. Those that converge towards the temple are, on the contrary, public roads. But, according to admitted and immemorial custom, they are up to within a certain distance of the temple public in a qualified sense only, viz., that they are open to certain classes of the public alone and are not king’s highways open to all communities. There is no public institution necessitating the entry into them of the entire public. The only real material inconvenience occasioned by the prohibition of entry into this area is the necessity to take devious and more lengthy routes from one point of the town of Vykom to another. This inconvenience the Government promised to remove by opening new roads for the use of the entire public on the outskirts of the prohibited area. This offer was not accepted, so that the sole justification for the demand for the removal of the prohibition is a feeling of self- respect or, in other words, sentiment. I grant that this feeling deserves to be respected; but I ask, is it possible for a Government to respect it if, in so doing, it is compelled to act in violation of a  well-recognized  and  well-established  legal  position and, in defiance of the religious beliefs entertained by another community?
 It has  been urged, in the course of the discussion on the resolution, that   the Government having thrown open public institutions, public offices and the public service to these communities, they cannot now refuse to remove this disability which is derogatory  to  their  self-respect.  It  is  true  that the  Gover- nment have done their utmost to remove several disabilities under which these communities  have laboured  so long   and to give them equal opportunities with the other communities as far as possible; but the grant of permission to enter areas considered sacred by certain other sections of the Hindu community is of quite a different, character, as it would violate established rights based on religious faith.
 It is a matter for deep regret that the Ezhavas and other non-caste Hindus of Travancore should have greatly prejudiced their cause by the methods they have adopted. The policy of attempting to secure the recognition of their claims by the caste Hindus through pressure put upon them by the Executive Government will be neither lasting nor far-reaching in its results. All settlements arrived at as the result of the exercise of force majeure are bound to be short-lived. It should have been far better had the Ezhavas devoted their energies to methods of peaceful persuasion and the education of the caste communities to a realization of the fact that the custom of untouchability is as degrading to the latter as it is unjust to the former. There is a
 
 world of difference between satyagraha meant to be an educative force and satyagraha intended as an instrument for the coercion of the Government and through them of the orthodox Hindus. What the sayagrahis should aim at is the conversion of  the  orthodox to whom untouchability is part of their faith. The results of such a course of action will, no doubt, be slow but being based on voluntary assent,  will  be permanent.
 A satisfactory solution of the question can be reached only through negotiations between the disputing communities and by a compromise acceptable to both. While the Government recognize the legal right of the caste Hindu communities to maintain the prohibition so long as the law is what it is, they cannot but feel that   it would be wise for these communities not to insist too strongly on their legal rights but to recognize the time-spirit and give up, as quickly as possible, religious beliefs and prejudices which militate against communal harmony, and to admit claims which the world has come to regard as irrefutable. The Government are prepared to do everything in their power to explore the avenues along which negotiations to this end may proceed and the needed rapprochement reached. More than this it is unreasonable to expect the Government to undertake and further persistence of both sides in this struggle, without change in their angle of vision, would only serve to further intensify class hatred and endanger the public peace.
