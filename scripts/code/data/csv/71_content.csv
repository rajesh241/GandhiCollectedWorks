1,"February 	25, 1937",INTERVIEW TO DR. CRANElibtech_1_footnote,"
      [February 	25, 1937]libtech_2_footnote  GANDHIJI: I shall 	certainly give you my reaction to Christianity. Even when I was 18 I 	came in touch with good Christians in London. Before that I had come 	in touch with what I used then to call ‘beef and beer-bottle 	Christianity’, for these were regarded as the indispensable 	criteria of a man becoming a Christian, with also a third thing, 	namely, adoption of a European style of dress. Those Christians were 	parodying St. Paul’s teaching—‘Call thou nothing unclean’. I 	went to London, therefore, with that prejudice against Christianity. 	I came across good Christians there who placed the Bible in my 	hands. Then I met numerous Christians in South Africa, and I have 	since grown to this belief that Christianity is as good and as true 	a religion as my own. For a time I struggled with the question, 	‘which was the true religion out of those I know? But ultimately I 	came to the deliberate conviction that there was no such thing as 	only one true religion, every other being false. There is no 	religion that is absolutely perfect. All are equally imperfect or 	more or less perfect, hence the conclusion that Christianity is as 	good and true as my own religion. But so also about Islam or 	Zoroastrianism or Judaism.  	I therefore do not take as literally true the textlibtech_3_footnotethat Jesus is the only begotten Son of God. God 	cannot be the exclusive father and I cannot ascribe exclusive 	divinity to Jesus. He is as divine as Krishna or Rama or Mahomed or 	Zoroaster. Similarly I do not regard every word of the Bible as the 	inspired word of God even as I do not regard every word of the Vedas 	or the Koran as inspired. The sum total of each of these books is 	certainly inspired, but I miss that inspiration in many of the 	things taken individually. The Bible is as much a book of religion 	with me as the Gita and the Koran.  	Therefore I am not interested in weaning you from Christianity and 	making you a Hindu, and I would not relish your designs upon        
 me, if you had any, to convert me to Christianity! I would also dispute your claim that Christianity is the only true religion. It is also a true religion, a noble religion, and along with other religions it has contributed to raise the moral height of mankind. But it has yet to make a greater contribution. After all what are 2,000 years in the life of a religion? Just now Christianity comes to yearning mankind in a tainted form. Fancy Bishops supporting slaughter in the name of Christianity.
 DR. CRANE: But, when you say that all religions are true, what do you do when there are conflicting counsels?
 G. I have no difficulty in hitting upon the truth, because I go by certain fundamental maxims. Truth is superior to everything and I reject what conflicts with it. Similarly that which is in conflict with non-violence should be rejected. And on matters which can  be reasoned out, that which conflicts with Reason must also be rejected.
 DR. C. In matters which can be reasoned out?
 G. Yes, there are subjects where Reason cannot take us far and we have to accept things on faith. Faith then does not contradict Reason but transcends it. Faith is a kind of sixth sense which works in cases which are without the purview of Reason. Well then, given these three criteria, I can have no difficulty in examining all claims made on behalf of religion. Thus to believe that Jesus is the only begotten son of God is to me against Reason, for God can’t marry and beget children. The word ‘son’ there can only be used in a figurative sense. In that sense everyone who stands in the position of Jesus is a begotten son of God. If a man is spiritually miles ahead of us we may say that he is in a special sense the son of God, though we are all children of God. We repudiate the relationship in our lives, whereas his life is a witness to that relationship.
 DR. C. Then you will recognize degrees of divinity. Would you not say that Jesus was the most divine?
G. No, for the simple reason that we have no data. Historically
 we have more data about Mahomed than anyone else because he was more recent in time. For Jesus there are less data and still less for Buddha, Rama and Krishna; and when we know so little about them, is it not preposterous to say that one of them was more divine thananother? In fact even if there were a great deal of data available, no judge should shoulder the burden of sifting all the evidence, if only for the reason that it requires a highly spiritual person to guage
 the degree of divinity, of the subjects he examines. To say that Jesus was 99 per cent divine, and Mahomed 50 per cent, and Krishna 10 per cent, is to arrogate to oneself a function which really does not belong to man.
 DR. C. But, let us take a debatable point. Supposing I was debating between whether violence is justified or not. Mahomedanism would  say  one  thing, Christianity another.
G. Then I must decide with the help of the tests I have suggested.
 DR. C. But does not Mahomed prescribe the use of the sword in certain circumstances?
G. I suppose most Muslims will agree. But I read religion in a
 different way. Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan derives his belief in non-violence from the Koran, and the Bishop of London derives his belief in violence from the Bible. I derive my belief in non-violence from the Gita, Whereas there are others who read violence in it. But if the worst came of the worst and if I came to the conclusion that the Koran teaches violence, I would still reject violence, but I would not therefore say that the Bible is superior to the Koran or that Mahomed is inferior to Jesus. It is not my function to judge Mahomed and Jesus. It is enough that my non-violence is independent of the sanction of scriptures. But the fact remains that religious books have a hold upon mankind which other books have not. They have made a greater impression on me than Mark Twain or, to take a more appropriate instance, Emerson. Emerson was a thinker. Jesus and Mahomed were through and through men of action in a  sense Emerson would never be. Their power was derived from their faith in God.
 DR. C. I will take a concrete instance now to show what I mean. I was terribly shocked on Monday. I counted 37 cows slain on the streets by Muslims in the name of religion, and in offence to the Hindu sentiment. I asked the Hindu friend who travelled with me why the Muslims did so. He said it was part of their religion. ‘Is it part of their spiritual growth?’ I asked him. He said it was. I met a Mussalman who said, ‘We both please God and ourselves’. Now here was a Mussalman revelling in a thing that outrages you and me too. Do you think all this is counter to the Koran?
G.	I	do	indeedlibtech_4_footnotelibtech_5_footnote.	Just    as    many	Hindu	practices,	e.g.,
 untouchability—are no part of Hindu religion, I say that cow-  slaughter is no part of Islam. But I do not wrestle with the Muslims who believe that it is part of Islam.
 
 DR. C. What do you say to the attempts to convert?
 G. I strongly resent these overtures to utterly ignorant men. I can perhaps understand overtures made to me, as indeed they are being made. For they can reason with me and I can reason with them. But I certainly resent the overtures made to Harijans. When a Christian preacher goes and says to a Harijan that Jesus was the only begotten son of God, he will give him a blank stare. Then he holds out all kinds of inducements which debase Christianity.
 DR. C. Would you say a Harijan is not capable of reason?
 G. He is. For instance, if you try to take work out of him without payment, he will not give it. He also has a sense of ethical values. But when you ask him to understand theological beliefs and categories he will not understand anything. I could not do so even when I was 17 and had a fair share of education and training. The orthodox Hindus have so horribly neglected the Harijan that it is astonishing how he adheres to the Hindu faith. Now I say it is outrageous for others to shake his faith.
 DR. C. What about a man who says he is commanded by God to do violence?
 G. There you would not put another God before him. You need not disturb his religion, but you will disturb his reason.
 DR. C. But take Hitler. He says he is carrying out God’s behest in persecuting the Jews and killing his opponents.
G. You will not pit one word of God against another word of
 God. But you will have to bear down his reason. For him you will have to produce a miracle which you will do when Christians will learn the art of dying without killing in defence of what they hold dearer then religion. But we can go on arguing like this endlessly. And then I may tell you that you are talking against time.
 And with this Gandhiji looked at the watch.
 DR. C. Just one question, then. Would you say then that your religion is a synthesis of all religions?
G. Yes, if you will. But I would call that synthesis Hinduism, and
 for you the synthesis will be Christianity. If I did not do so, you would always be patronizing me, as many Christians do now, saying, ‘How nice it would be if Gandhi accepted Christianity,’ and Muslims would be doing the same, saying, ‘How nice it would be if Gandhi accepted Islam!’ That immediately puts a barrier between you and me. Do you see that?
 DR. C. I do. Just one last question. In your Hinduism do you basically include the caste system?
G. I do not. Hinduism does not believe in caste. I would
 obliterate it at once. But I believe in varnadharma, which is the law of life. I believe that some people are born to teach and some to defend and some to engage in trade and agriculture and some to do manual labour, so much so that these occupations become hereditary. The law of varna is nothing but the law of conservation of energy. Why should my son not be a scavengar if I am one?
 DR. C. Indeed? Do you go so far?
 G. I do, because I hold a scavenger’s profession in no way inferior to a clergyman’s.
 DR. C. I grant that, but should Lincoln have been a wood-chopper rather than President of the U.S.A.?
 G. But why should not a wood-chopper be a President of the United States? Gladstone used to chop wood.
 DR. C. But he did not accept it as his calling.
 G. He would not have been worse off if he had done so. What I mean is, one born a scavenger must earn his livelihood by being a scavenger, and then do whatever else he likes. For a scanvenger is as worthy of his hire as a lawyer or your President. That, according to me, is Hinduism. There is no better communism on earth, and I have illustrated it with one verse from the Upanishads which means: God pervades all—animate and inanimate. Therefore renounce all and dedicate it to God and then live. The right of living is thus derived from renunciation. It does not say, ‘When all do their part of the work  I too will do it’. It says, ‘Don’t bother about others, do your job first and leave the rest to Him’. Varnadharma acts even as the law of gravitation. I cannot cancel it or its working by trying to jump higher and higher day by day till gravitation ceases to work. That effort will be vain. So is the effort to jump over one another. The law of varna is the antithesis of competition which kills.

    CHI. 	KAMALNAYAN,  February 	26, 1937 
  	I got your letter. You are getting more and more involved and here 	everybody is talking of calling you back soon. Your father-in- 
 law wants it to be early. So does Jankibehn. Father also is practically of the same view. I am neutral, though I don’t believe that you will bring home much from there. But I wouldn’t approve of calling you back so long as you are eager to continue there. If you wish to take up business, you should give up your desire for a degree. What will you do after becoming a barrister? Or a graduate? As I understand you, you wish to earn money. You do not wish to live on Father’s money or to become a sannyasi. If I am right, business is the proper field for you endeavour. If you agree with this, give up the desire to be a barrister or to get a degree. Your English must have improved sufficiently by now. If, however, you are keen on a degree and on going to Oxford or Cambridge, you may see Deenbandhu Andrews. Those whom I know at Oxford and Cambridge, I know through him. Please, therefore, see him. He will make the necessary arrangement for you. He lives at Cambridge. You know him, of course, but I am writing to him all the same. He will, therefore, remember when you write to him. His address is: Master’s Lodge, Pembroke College, Cambridge. Do whatever you do after full deliberation. Keep writing to me. You do seem to be a little lazy about writing.

 "
4,,OUR CATTLE WEALTH,"
  
 This is being written on Bakr-Id day—a day of rejoicing for Mussalmans and grief for Hindus. It is day of grief for  Hindus because their Mussalman brethern slaughter cows for sacrifice though
 they know that the cow is an object of worship and veneration for Hindus. Though I hold the cow as much in veneration as any Hindu and am responsible for bringing into being the— in my opinion— only scientific society for effectively protecting the cow, I have never sympathized with the Hindu grief and the implied anger against Mussalmans on Bakr-Id. The latter are undoubtedly foolish and obstinate in that they slaughter the cow and needlessly wound Hindu susceptibility. For there is no religious obligation on the part of Mussalmans to kill the cow on Bakr-Id or any other day. I have heard some Mussalmans arguing that Hindus by their worship of the cow make it obligatory on them to kill the cow. This borders on compulsion. But if the Mussalman is foolish and obstinate, the Hindu is criminally ignorant and indirectly becomes party to the slaughter of the cow by the Mussalman. For cows are sold by Hindus as a rule. Hindu grief and anger are uncalled for. Hindu ignorance  is responsible for many more deaths of cows than the deaths casused by the Mussalmans’ slaughter of the cow for one day in the year. Be it noted that Hindus are apparently quite reconciled to cow-slaughter on days other than Bakr-Id.
 I have in my possession startling authentic figures showing the annual slaughter of cattle and deaths from natural causes. According to the livestock census of 1935 about 80 per cent die naturally and 20 per cent are slaughtered. The percentage of natural death, however, varies according to locality. Where grazing conditions are good and cultivation careful, natural deaths fall as low as 7 per cent, and in famine zones they rise to 30 per cent. In the Bombay Presidency (British) it is estimated that there were, in 1935, 74.5 lakhs of cattle. Of these 9 lakhs died naturally against 2 lakhs by slaughter, i.e., 12 per cent against 3 per cent. In 1935 in British India, including Bengal and Bihar and Orissa, there were over eight crores of cows against just under three crores of buffaloes. Comparison between the census of 1935 and 1930 shows that buffalo wealth is on the increase three times that of the cow.
 Now it is common knowledge that the cow is generally owned by Hindus. If they removed their unpardonable ignorance, they could easily prevent many deaths from natural causes. I reproduce immediately below this note two extractslibtech_6_footnoteshowing why so many cattle die annually and what can and should be done to prevent this
 
 tremenduous waste of wealth. Time was when the number of cows was the measure of man’s wealth. Today the cows are a drag on a man’s possessions. It is almost like depreciation of currency. The only difference is that prevention of depreciation of cattle or rather cow currency is possible by internal effort. The effort is threefold:
  No 	waste of 	energy over 	persuading Mussalmans to 	give up 	cow-slaughter, whether 	for sacrifice 	or food. 	They must be 	put on 	their own honour.  Exclusive 	concentration on 	improvement of 	the cow and 	therefore giving up 	of buffalo milk 	and ghee.  Exclusive 	use of 	dead cattle 	hide and free use other 	than for 	food of all the parts of carcasses, and improvement in tanning. 
 The material for improvement is ready at hand in the numerous pinjarapoles and goshalas covering the whole land. The only thing needful is to remove certain prejudices and to conduct  these institutions on sound scientific lines.

 "
5,,VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE VICES,"
  
A khadi-worker writes:libtech_7_footnote
 It is good question. There should be no comparison of vices. As for me, I look upon untruth as the root cause of all sins. No institution which tolerates untruth can serve the community or survive for long. But when a man resorts to untruthfulness, it assumes various forms. It is a kind of immorality. Untruth rarely parades itself in naked form. An immoral person commits three sins. He is guilty of untruthfulness because he hides his misbehaviour. The misbehaviour itself is a sin. And thirdly, it demoralizes the other person with whom he misbehaves.
 All other vices which the correspondent has mentioned are abstract. We can neither see them nor catch them. They can be discussed only when they become manifest in action. Then only is it possible to think of remedies for them. Suppose a man hates another. As long as that hatred does not lead to some action, the hatred cannot be criticized nor can the jealous person be improved. But when that
 
 hatred causes any harm to another, then it can be condemned and the person deserves punishment. The fact is, sexual immorality is given a long rope in the social as well as the legal code, although it causes great harm to society. The thief gets stringent punishment and the poor fellow is almost ostracized by society. But the fashionable debauchee moves freely and goes scot-free. The law turns a blind eye to him. I am convinced that an institution pledged to the service of millions should have no room for debauchees, just as it has no place for thives and rowdies.

 "
6,,WHY SHOULD THREE ANNAS BE PAID?,"
  
 I am discussing here a difficulty which I am faced  with  in Segaon in trying to put into practice to some extent the ideas which I had expressed regarding the rate of wages earned by women spinners for yarn spun by them. I engage in, or permit, as little discussion as possible on the experiments which I am carrying on in Segaon and the hopes which I am entertaining because my experiments are still at a preliminary stage. I neither show definite results nor see any myself. I regard myself as an extremely cautious worker. I work out each task in a scientific spirit. A devotee of truth cannot function in any other way. While working in that manner, I feel it would be  thought improper for me to write anything at this stage about my experiments in Segaon. But there can be nothing improper in saying what I have been unable to accomplish to this day.
 Now, in my opinion, anyone who puts in one hour of diligent work should get one anna. So that a woman who spins skilfully for an hour should also be paid one anna. I have been unable to make any experienced person put this into effect; and that is as it should be. If crores of Indians start earning an anna an hour, India would become an economically prosperous country. Today, the average annual income of an Indian is fifty to sixty rupees; this is not the minimum income. If instead, the minimum income becomes one hundred and eighty rupees no one would starve.
 However, in Segaon, to this day, I have not been able to pay three annas for eight hours’ work to any unemployed person. In Segaon the rate for a man is three annas and for a woman five to six pice. Children of fifteen or sixteen earn something in between. If I
 could have my way, I would see to it that women are paid the same wages as men. But I have been unable to do even this little bit. And I have been unable to pay, or make others pay, the same rate to the unemployed as is paid to labourers in Segaon. This is because the rate  I have mentioned applies to those who do not ordinarily remain unemployed. What I desire is the capacity to pay three annas for eight hours’ labour to whosover comes in search of work. I have not been able to achieve that or make much progress. I cannot accept that I alone am to blame for this. Partly no doubt my own failing is responsible. But it is for this reason that I have proved for myself and others like me the necessity for living in village. It is not true that a few months’ stay in the villages enables one to solve all its problems. I have never imagined it can. One can have a grasp of rural problems and find solutions for them only when one stays in a village like a true villager from three to five years. Here I have merely noted the difficulties experienced in paying even the unemployed the wage of three annas. At the root of this difficulty I see our inveterate idleness.
 The unemployed are so indifferent that if entrusted with some work of which they have no experience, they are not even prepared to consider it. They have formed the habit of agreeing to everything, so they will nod their heads in assent to any suggestion but will do nothing beyond that. However, by mentioning these difficulties I have by no means expressed my despondency. I have expressed my sympathy towards other colleagues who experience similar difficulty. Idleness which has persisted for years cannot be got rid of all at once. Patience is what is required. We do not wish to give three annas or even more for eight hours’ work by way of a gift, but we wish to create conditions where people can earn this amount. In trying to achieve this lies the education and the test of social workers as well as villagers.

 "
7,,DEFINITION OF POVERTY,"
  
 While discussing the question of providing work to the poor living in villages, a gentleman writes to say:
 You had once said that those who engaged labourers to plough their fields could not be called poor. But that is not enough. Can it be said that those who do not suffer from want of food and clothing and do not have to incur debts are not poor?
 This question may be answered in the affirmative as well as in the negative. If we consider the matter from the standpoint of health, few persons in the Indian climate suffer from want of clothes. This is because innumerable persons can do with loincloths, and it may be said that it does not harm the health. But even persons said to belong to the middle class do not get a proper diet from the nutritional standpoint. Except for a few wealthy people, all others are unable to get sufficient milk, ghee, vegetables and fruit. They may well afford a drop of dirty milk adulterated with water, and a small quantity of vegetables, but they never get fruit. And because of the want of these three things, crores of people in India, including those of the middleclass, can never maintain good health. Hence, if we examine the matter from the standpoint of health, the number of poor people increases greatly. This however is not the standpoint of the correspondent. For him the question of poverty has arisen in the
context of the problem of a minimum wage.
 My definition of poverty, if considered from that standpoint would run as follows: Those who, despite working the whole day, cannot earn even three annas are all poor, because the correspondent has before him only the problem of providing work to the unemployed in the villages. Although this is an imperfect definition, it is of importance to workers. The reason being that if poverty is considered from the standpoint of health, etc., all villagers and many city-dwellers also would be regarded as poor—and actually, they are so. But such a definition confuses the workers.
 This does not mean that such persons should not be served. The village-worker is constantly faced with problems of sanitation, health and economic betterment. He is constantly faced with problems of how people should get pure milk and butter-milk in their own villages, how they can obtain vegetables and fruit, how those who do not get sufficient coverings for the winter can do so. And his skill lies in solving these. But no one can solve all problems at once. It is for this very reason that I have given a working definition of poverty so that everyone can realize that it is their dharma to serve the maximum number of poor people and make a beginning in that direction.

 February 28, 1937
 BHAI MOOLSHANKAR,
You did very well indeed in writing to me.
 I see no necessity for you to do anything which would hurt your parents’ feelings. It is only when parents push the children into an obviously immoral course of action that the latter are entitled to disregard them. There is nothing of the sort in your case. In many matters your parents are ready to go along with you. You can do a lot of service even while doing business. The ability to earn an honest cowrie is not easy to acquire. Even doing that is a form of service and also tests one’s intelligence. For the present, therefore, continue
patiently to do what you are doing.
 Continue to write to me whenever necessary. If you feel you must come and see me, you may do so.

 Received your letter.  	There is no reason at all to be scared of hip-baths. The secret is 	that you should not feel cold while sitting in the tub and the body 	should be sufficiently warm after coming out of the tub. For this, 	you should bring warmth to the body either by walking or by covering 	yourself up in bed or by pouring over yourself a few mugs of hot 	water after the hip-bath. 
 Friction-bath can be taken	libtech_15_footnoteThe bather should perch on a
 stool, with the private parts kept away from the edge of the stool. They should then be rubbed with a piece of cloth repeatedly soaked in the tub-water. This is what is called friction-bath. The idea behind it is as follows: there is a complex of nerves at the opening of the organ. The effect on them spreads throughout the body with lightning speed. This effect is quite the opposite of that produced by masturbation and other bad habits. And this checks many diseases and cures many others.
 Garlic should not be chewed. It should be ground and mixed with vegetables like a sauce. Some people take it with curds. If youcan get fresh garlic it is better than dry garlic. If sweet limes and oranges are available no other fruits are required. If you can get good palm gur, you can carry on well with it. You must get good milk. A person like you cannot stay where good milk is not available. Garlic never gives a cold, rather it cures a cold.
 I can say without hesitation that the increase in Chimanlal’s weight is due to his taking earth treatment.

20,"March 3, 1937",INTERVIEW TO AN EGYPTIAN DEPUTATIONlibtech_20_footnote,"
  
 March 3, 1937
 “It was impossible to come to India and go away without seeing you”, they said to Gandhiji, to which Gandhiji jokingly said:
And yet you come here at the fag end of your visit.
 With Gandhiji the only topic they discussed was that of cementing the relation between India and Egypt.
GANDHIJI: I should heartily welcome the co-operation.
 SHEIKH IBRAHIM EL GIBALI: We hope the day will not be far off when India regains her past glory and revives her ancient civilization. We have many things in common, climate, colour, food, and we are orientals. The time has come for us to come closer together.
 PROF. HABIB AHMED : We have discovered it is not good fot both the countries to rely on their older generations. They should rely more on the younger generations. Our youths should go to India and yours should come to Egypt as sportsmen.
G. Not only may we have an exchange and a mixing together in
 the field of sport but we should have it in the field of education. We should invite professors from Egypt and you should invite those from India, so that we may develop cultural contacts.
 SHEIKH IBRAHIM EL GIBALI: This end can be attained if there is an intellectual fusion of blood between both countries.
G.  That is  true, and to  reach some  kind  of  solution  I  would
 suggest your making a public declaration of this kind. I make an offer. If you kindly send an Egyptian lad of intelligence and resourcefulness, we will welcome him and adopt him here. You will see the maker of this place, Jamnalal Bajaj. There is not a public institution here which does not owe its existence to him. He has had no college education, but he has a heart of gold and he has lavishly given of his gold for the welfare of the country. He has a school here where he has Hindu and Mussalman boys. There is provisionthere for Urdu teaching for Mussalman boys. He has secured a Principal who is an ideal teacher. So if you will send a promising lad, we will adopt him here and he will be like a seed which will grow into a mighty tree. Then there is the Jamia Millia in Delhi where there are fine men like Dr. Zakir Husain, Prof. Mujeeb; and you can exchange boys and professors with the Jamia. Make our boys Egyptian and we will make
 
 yours Indian. Our different religions should not matter. If you will respect our religion and we respect yours, there should be no bar to a healthy development of these relations. Identity of hearts is what is wanted, and if that is there everything will follow.

SURENDRA,  	I am having consultations about the date of your marriage. I gather 	that you desire the marriage to take place in proper style. You are 	even thinking of a gathering of friends. If that is so, please let 	me know your reason. One reason I have understood. You feel that all 	of us elders have enjoyed celebrations of marriages in our time 	andnow we are out to stop persons like you from doing that, and you 	ask why. This is a pure misconception. If, according to our custom, 	we regard marriage as a festive occasion, a person can enjoy the 	celebration only once. Now as regards myself, I may tell you that 	whatever happened when I was only twelve years of age. My parents 	did not ask for my consent in regard to anything. If anybody had 	enjoyed the celebrations, it was they and the other relatives. I am 	not aware of having enjoyed the occasion. Whatever fun I may have 	had at that time was much in the same way as children enjoy play. I 	had no sense at all of the responsibility of the occasion. This is 	how I enjoyed the    
 celebration. I do not know anything of Kishorelal. You need not, therefore, envy my enjoyment. What I wish is that on the day fixed you should come alone. I will get all the religious ceremonies performed and, after they are over, you may take away Manu on the very same day. If you want to have a gathering of friends, you may have one at Akola or Bombay. I have no zest at all for such things. I am not talking about renunciation but only about common duty. Nowadays some thinkers have elevated sensual enjoyment to the position of a dharma. I have not been able to accept this view. In my opinion marriage is a means of observing self-control. It is desirable that men and women should have only one connection and not many. This is their duty. Marriage should be for service, not for self- indulgence. The relationship of man and woman is only for progeny and should have no other purpose. This is the ideal. Certainly one cannot say that this ideal is wrong simply because it  cannot  be attained. But if it is right, it is one’s duty to follow it in practice to the best of one’s ability. And if such is indeed one’s duty, then the marriage ceremony should be made as religious, quiet and austere as possible. If you understand this, then you and Manu should look upon marriage as a new birth and should enter it with a sense of duty. Do not regard marriage as a festive occasion but enter the householder’s estate with the blessings of elders and with full understanding of the meaning of marriage.
 If you have understood this, you will give up insisting  on inviting anybody. If I can I will stop even Nanabhai, Neelkanth and others from coming and wasting money on  travelling. Notwithstanding these views of mine, however, I do not wish to hurt you. You may, therefore, unhesitatingly let me know whatever you desire.

  	I got your letter. I have studied the plan. I once again remembered 	the original ashram at Godhra. After spending Rs. 3,000, how many 	untouchables will you have uplifted? I cannot understand your 	scheme. I was under the impression that you would spend at the most 	Rs. 1,000. Your plan is suitable not for a temple but for a prince’s 	court or palace. But what can I say when a donor like Sardar is 	ready to satisfy you? But if I got Rs. 3,000, I would spend out of 	it not more than Rs. 1,000 on a hut for myself, fencing and the 	temple, and spend the rest in the service of the Harijans in other 	ways.

Scientifically, he 	felt, it 	was hardly 	correct to say that 	all religions 	are equal. 	People would make comparisons 	between animists and 	theists. “I 	would say,” said 	Mr. Keithahn, “it 	is no use comparing 	religions. They are 	different ways. Do 	you think 	we can 	explain the 	thing in 	different terms?  GANDHIJI: 	You are right when you say that it is impossible to compare 	them. But the deduction from it is that they are equal. All men are 	born free and equal, but one is much stronger or weeker than another 	physically and mentally. Therefore superficially there is     
 noequality between the two. But there is an essential equality: in our nakedness. God is not going to think of me as Gandhi and you as Keithahn. And what are we in this mighty universe? We are less than atoms, and as between atoms there is no use asking which is smaller and which is bigger. Inherently we are equal. The differences of race and skin and of mind and body and of climate and nation are transitory. In the same way essentially all religions are equal. If you read the Koran, you must read it with the eye of the Muslim; if you read the Bible, you must read it with the eye of the Christian; if you read the Gita, you must read it with the eye of a Hindu. Where is the use of scanning details and then holding up a religion to ridicule? Take the very first chapter of Genesis or of Matthew. We read a long pedigree and then at the end we are told that Jesus was born of a virgin. You come up against a blind wall. But I must read it all with the eye of a Christian.
 K. Then even in our Bible, there is the question of Moses and Jesus. We must hold them to be equal.
G. Yes. All prophets are equal. It is a horizontal plane.
 K. If we think in terms of Einstein’s relativity all are equal. But I cannot happily express that equality.
G. This is why I say they are equally true and equally imperfect.
 The finer the line you draw, the nearer it approaches Euclid’s true staight line, but it never is true straight line. The tree of religion is the same, there is not that physical equality between the branches. They are all growing, and the person who belongs to the growing branch must not gloat over it and say, ‘Mine is the superior one’. None is superior, none is inferior, to the other.

28,"March 5, 1937","DISCUSSION WITH A
ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTlibtech_24_footnote","
  
 [March 5, 1937]libtech_25_footnote
 A Roman Catholic Father who saw Gandhiji the other day asked how Gandhiji proposed to break the caste.
GANDHIJI: It is already breaking. All it requires is education, and
 under the education that is being imparted for some time it is  breaking. But by   education  I   do  not  mean  literary  education  but
 
 thespread of true knowledge. Caste has no religious basis, but it is certainly regarded as bound up with religion, though it is not derived from the scriptures. Untouchability is the last word on caste, and as soon as untouchability goes, caste goes. The outcaste has been all over the world. In Europe the Jews were outcastes and confined to the ghettos where life was much worse than in the untouchables’ quarters. The degradation to which the outcastes in India are reduced is bad enough, but what one knew of ghettos from Israel Zangwill’s works, which years ago I read at the instance of a friend, was something blood-curdling. Such a thing cannot happen in India, because of the non-violence of a sort that we are practising. However, though we have no ghettos, there is nothing to choose between them and untoucha- bility. Take untouchability out and the fabric of caste is destroyed.
 And here Gandhiji explained the distinction between caste and varna, which was not only a law for the Hindus but a universal law, to which we confirm, with or without knowledge, and if we do not, we do so at our peril. Caste had been the best target for missionaries to assail Hinduism with, and rightly, but caste in the sense of varna and trade guilds, as Sir W. W. Hunterlibtech_26_footnotedescribed it, will live forever.
 CATHOLIC FATHER: If Hinduism became monotheistic, Christianity and
 Hinduism can serve India in co-operation.
 G. I would love to see the co-operation happen, but it cannot if the present-day Christian mission persist in holding up Hinduism to ridicule and saying that no one can go to Heaven unless he renounces and denounces Hinduism. But I can conceive a  good  Christian, silently working away, and shedding the sweet aroma of his life on Hindu communities, like the rose which does not need any speech to spread its fragrance but spreads it because it must. Even so a truly spiritual life. Then surely there would be peace on earth and goodwill among men. But not so long as there is militant or ‘muscular’ Christianity. This is not to be found in the Bible, but you find it in Germany and other countries.
 R.C.F. But if Indians begin to believe in one God and give up idolatry, don’t you think the whole difficulty will be solved?
G. Will the Christians be satisfied with it? Are they all united?
 R. C .F . Of course all the Christian sects are not united.
 
 G. Then you are asking only a theoretical question. And may I ask you, is there any amalgamation between Islam and Christianity, though both are said to believe in one God? If these two have not amalgamated, there is less hope of amalgamation of Christians and Hindus along the lines you suggest. I have my own solution, but the first instance I dispute the description that Hindus believe in many gods and are idolators. They do say there are many gods, but they also declare unmistakably that there is One God, God of gods. It is therefore not proper to suggest that Hindus believe in many gods. They certainly believe in many worlds. Just as there is a world  inhabited by men and another by beasts, so also is there one inhabited by superior beings called gods, whom we do not see but who nevertheless exist. The whole mischief is created by the English rendering of the words deva or devta for which you have not found a better term than ‘god’. But god is Ishwara, Devadhideva, God of  gods. So you see it is the word ‘god’, used to describe different divine beings, that has given rise to such confusion. I believe that I am a thorough Hindu but I never believe in many gods. Never even in my childhood did I hold that belief, and no one ever taught me to do so.
 As for idol-worship, you cannot do without it in some form or other. Why does a Mussalman give his life for defending a mosque which he calls a house of God? And why does a Christian go to a church and when he is required to take an oath swear by the Bible? Not that I see any objection to it. And what is it if not idolatry to give untold riches for building mosques and tombs? And what do the Roman Catholics do when they kneel before Virgin Mary and before saints—quite imaginary figures in stone or painted on canvas or glass?
 R. C .F . But I keep my mother’s photo and kiss it in veneration of her. But I do not worship it, nor do I worship saints. When I worship God, I acknowledge Him as Creator and greater than any human being.
G. Even so, it is not the stone we worship but it is God we
worship in images of stone or metal however crude they may be.
 R. C .F . But villagers worship stones as God.
 G. No, I tell you they do not worship anything that is less than God. When you kneel before Virgin Mary and ask for  her intercession, what do you do? You ask to establish contact with God through her. Even so a Hindu seeks to establish contact with God through a stone image. I can understand your  asking for the Virgin’sintercession. Why are Mussalmans filled with awe and
 exultation when they enter a mosque? Why, is not the whole universe a mosque? And what about the magnificent canopy of heaven that spreads over you? Is it any less than a mosque? But I understand and sympathize with the Muslims. It is their way of approach to God. The Hindus have their own way of approach to the same Eternal Being. Our media of approach are different, but that does not make Him different.
 R. C .F . But the Catholics believe that God revealed to them the true way.
 G. But why do you say that the will of God is expressed only in one book  called the Bible and not in others? Why do  you circumscribe the power of God?
 R. C .F . But Jesus proved that he had received the word of God through miracles.
 G. But that is Mahomed’s claim too. If you accept Christian testimony you must accept Muslim testimony and Hindu testmony too.
 R. C. F . But Mahomed said he could not do miracles.
 G. No. He did not want to prove the existence of God  by miracles. But he claimed to receive messages from God.
 R. C. F . We are glad the Congress has had a great success. But what about its veering round to communism?
 G. Has it? I do not see it. But if it does, and if it is not the Russian model, I do not mind it. For what does communism mean in the last analysis? It means a classless society—an ideal that is worth striving for. Only I part company with it when force is called to aid for achieving it. We are all born equal, but we have all these centuries resisted the will of God. The idea of inequality, of ‘high and low’ is an evil, but I do not believe in eradicating evil from the human breast at the point of the bayonet. The human breast does not lend itself to that means.
 R. C. F . When Hinduism comes to power, will it not make a united front against Christianity? There are all the signs of Hinduism coming to power. And if it happens here, as it is happening in Spain, Indian Christians will be despised and persecuted and swept off.
G. It is an impossible picture. There is no such thing as Hindu
 rule, there will be no such thing. How can anyone eradicate a population  of  seven  million  Christians?   And  that   persupposes  the
 destruction of Mussalmans too! Let me tell you that no Hindu in his wildest imagination ever thought of this. Will the world tolerate any such thing? If Hinduism ever sought to do it, it would be committing suicide. But I tell you that has never been the desire of the Hindus. Hinduism was well able to destroy the first Christians that came. Why did it not do anything of the kind? Travancore is a brilliant example of toleration. I was asked while I was there to see the most ancient church where St. Thomas is said to have planted the first Cross. Why should he have been allowed to plant it?
 R. C. F . But in St. Francis Xavier’s timelibtech_27_footnotethere came a time when Christians were persecuted. But I do not know history and my information may be incorrect. But what makes me afraid is what I actually saw and heard in Japan. There I heard in a public speech a responsible man saying, ‘Buddhism is the religion of Japan, we must consolidate it, all other religions should be destroyed.
G. Well, well, no Hindu dreams of such a thing. Even if he
dreamt it, it would be impossible.
 But now the Father revealed his bugbear—Arya Samaj!
 G. I agree that the Arya Samaj represents a type of militant Hinduism, but they never believed in the cult of the sword. The worst thing they are capable of is to ask you to become a Hindu if you went and spoke on their platform!
 R. C. F . But I have heard Arya Samajists say that Christianity is a Western religion, and as everything that comes from the West is to be discarded, Christianity must also be discarded.
G. I have never heard of the talk of Christianity being blotted
 out of India. The Arya Samaj is a community that asks its followers to go to the ends of the earth to preach Arya Dharma, but they have not yet done so. It has a firm foothold in the Punjab. Arya supremacy in the sense you dread is an inconceivable thing. The Hindus are really not the major community if you put the rest together. But why should I prolong the discussion? It is not a practical proposition at all.

  "
29,,AS OTHER SEE US,"
  
Here is a letterlibtech_28_footnotelibtech_29_footnotewhich has been lying on my file for some time:
 Your attitude towards religious conversion and particularly the hope you entertain for the Depressed Classes within the  fold  of  Hinduism,  overlooks the prevalent practices of Hinduism as it exists in India today...
 Any religion is judged by its fruits. Here is a contrast. Take the case of the Christian religion, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant. The funds that are collected from the rich and poor are carefully accounted for and repaid in the form of medical and educational service. Religious worship is open to all alike. The number of schools, colleges, dispensaries, hospitals and orphanges admirably served by their religious institution bear eloquent testimony to the quality of faith that is in them. It is not a theology and philosophy which they possess but the self-sacrificing service which they render in abundant measure towards all that is a contrast to the service rendered by the temples and mutts. What are the uses of the wealth of temples and mutts? Are not these weapons of superstition and oppression? The heads of these mutts live princely lives with vast endowments,. I am informed that there are regular lawyers to collect
 dues and serve the interests of these religious heads, swamis and gurus. This state of affairs is an oppression worse than popery in its worst days. Not merely the accumulated wealth and the annual collections, which in all these mutts must amount to several crores, are never properly accounted for, but this gigantic system of ghastly exploitation continues to be supported by the most intellectual leaders of the people as if Hindu society will break up by questioning it. This is practical Hinduism. Why should there be any surprise that the Depressed Classes alone should revolt against a system which denies them equal rights to worship the Deity but keeps them also in perpetual social excommunication? Why is it that no one ventures to question the priestly oppression, this draining away annually the wealth of the people without any service whatever? . . .
 . . . It is exploitation by religious heads that has crushed the people, and the money-lender and the State combined have finished the process. It is not more work and harder work, and the variety of cottage industries that thesehalf-dead half-living masses require, but more vocational schools and dispensaries, maternity and child welfare centres and better food. If the
 State is not moved very easily by your Herculean endeavours, Hinduism
 
 requires a far more drastic purge as it has been established some thousands of years longer than this alien Government. . . .
 Bishops and priests of the Christian religion, in spite of the fierce criticism levelled against them in this land and every other country, render humanitarian service unequalled by any other class of human beings who follow any other faith or no faith, and are approachable to all people. . .
 It is good to see ourselves as others see us. Try as we may, we are never able to know ourselves fully as we are, especially the evil side of us. This we can do only if we are not angry with our critics but will take in good part whatever they might have to say. Anyway, I propose to examine the foregoing criticism as dispassionately as I can. The grave limitations of Hinduism as it is seen today in practice must be admitted. Many mutts and their administration are undoubtedly a disgrace to Hinduism. The money that is poured into some of them does not return to the worshippers in the form of service. This state of things must be ended or mended.
 Humanitarian work done by Christian missions must also be admitted.
 But these admissions of mine must not be interpreted to mean endorsement of the deductions of the writer. Economic and educational relief is required by most poor Indians in common with Harijans. But the latter suffer from special disabilities. It is not a question of what disabilities they resent. It is the duty of the so-called superior Hindus to break the chains that bind  the  Harijans  even though they may hug them.The admission by the writer of the sublimity of Hinduism as expounded by Vivekanand and Radhakrishanan should have led to his discovery of its percolation down to the masses. I make bold to say that in spite of the crudeness which one sees among the villagers, class considered, in all that is good in human nature they compare favourably with any villagers in the world. This testimony is borne out by the majority of travellers who from the times of Huen Tsang down to the present times have recorded their impressions. The innate culture that the villagers of India show, the art which one sees in the homes of the poor, the restraint with which the villagers conduct themselves, are surely due to the religion that has bound them together from time immemorial.
 In his zeal to belittle Hinduism, the writer ignores the broad fact that Hinduism has produced a race of reformers who have successfully combated prejudices, superstitions and abuses. Without any drum-beating Hinduism has devised a system of relief of the poor which has been the envy of many foreign admirers. I myself feel that
 it leaves much to be desired. It has its evil side. But from the philanthropic standpoint it has wholly justified itself. It is not the Indian habit to advertise charities through printed reports and the like. But he who runs may see the free kitchens and free medical relief given along indigenous lines.
 The writer belittles village work. It betrays gross ignorance. If the mutts and the revenue offices were extinguished and free schools were opened, the people would not be cured of their inertia. Mutts must be reformed, the revenue system must be  overhauled,  free primary schools must be established in every village. But starvation will not disappear because people pay no revenue and mutts are destroyed and schools spring up in every village. The greatest education in the villages consists in the villagers being taught or induced to work methodically and profitably all the year round whether it be on the land or at industries connected with the villages.
 Lastly, my correspondent seems to resent acceptance by us of humanitarian services by missionaries. Will he have an agitation led against these missionary institutions? Why should they have non- Christian aid? They are established with the view of weaning Indians from their ancestral faith even as expounded by Vivekanand and Radhakrishnan. Let them isolate the institutions from the double purpose. It will be time enough then to expect non-Christian aid. The critic must be aware of the fact that even as it is some of these institutions do get non-Christian aid. My point is that there should be no complaint if they do not receive such aid so long as they have an aim which is repugnant to the non-Christian sentiment.

 CHI. AMTUL SALAAM,
 I got your letter today, Saturday. You seem to have reached there quite in time. Amtullibtech_30_footnotewas saved miraculously . . .  libtech_31_footnoteYou have asked me to suggest a name for the girl. But what do I know about that. I can only think of “Amina” or “Fatima”. It is the aunt’s
 
 prerogative to name a baby and you are the aunt. It is for you, therefore, to choose the name. You have suggested that I should write to Amtul, but you have not given me even her full name. Please, therefore, show the following to her.
 “I congratulate you on both you and your daughter having been saved by God. But Amtul Salaam tells me that you had wanted a boy. I know that many women have such a wish. But it is not a proper wish. Why should we give so much importance to whether it is a boy or a girl? We should be happy with whatever God sends us. May God give you both a long life”.
 You may certainly write to Maulana Saheblibtech_32_footnotewhatever you wish and obtain any fatwa that you like. I only wish to see you at peace with yourself anyhow.
 I have had a talk with Kanu. He says that he had no wish whatever to give up his present work. If he had not been engrossed in the Ramayana work, he would have liked to do khadi work with you. But he feels that he would be violating his pledge if he gave up the work to which he has dedicated himself. If, therefore,  you  want  Kanu’s help in khadi work, you can have it only in Wardha.
 Now that you have got work of your liking there, your health must improve. But you are bound to continue to be ill so long as your mind is not at peace.

32,,HOW TO BEGINlibtech_37_footnote,"
  
 My invitation in these columns some time back to such khadi workers as may be anxious to become adepts in the various processes relating to the production of Khadi,libtech_38_footnotehas evoked a wide reponse and I have already received several communications on the subject. The object of the following remarks is to set forth a few practical hints for the guidance of these friends.
 The first essential condition for anyone who wants to become master of any subject is to have a living faith in it. He must next have the eagerness to learn and readiness to make the necessary sacrifice for its sake. Books, teachers and other accessories of education are of course necessary in a more or less degree, but passion for knowledge and eagerness to learn are the most essential of all. Given these, the other things will follow of themselves. I would therefore suggestto these intending students of the khadi science that they can at once make a begining by finiding out what processes relative to khadi production are being carried out in their immediate neighbourhood and picking up all the useful information with regard to  them available there. The main task that faces a student of the khadi science today is collation and co-ordination of personal experience. A  number of different processes relating to the production of khadi are today in vogue in different parts of the country. But there is no single person today who fully knows all of them. And yet complete, detailed knowledge of all these different processes is necessary before the science of khadi can be developed. The task is obviously beyond the compass of a single individual. But if there are a number of persons
 
 who are truly fired by a scientific spirit of research and they apply themselves to the task in a systematic manner, they will, by pooling their talents and experience, be able to evolve a living, growing science of khadi in a short time. But before they can do that, they will need to have themselves collectively mastered all the processes of khadi production that are in vogue in the country today.
 To take a concrete instance, several varieties of khadi are produced in different parts of Andhra today, employing different methods of carding. Now any khadi worker in Andhra who is anxious to acquire the science of khadi can begin by mastering all  these various methods. For this he need not quit his province. Let him by way of a start pick up the process which is current in his immediate neighbourhood. A scientific study of carding would, of course, include a knowledge of the construction of the carding-bow on the part of the student. He would further need to know the materials from which the gut string and other component parts of a carding-bow are made and how; what exactly the length of a carding-bow should be in order to yield the best results, and the effects of departure from the standard length; where precisely the stroke on the bow-string should be delivered and the reason why, and so on in respect of a host of other questions about which even the best of our professional carders today know little and care even less. Similarly, with regard to cotton a worker who takes up a study of carding as a science would need to know all about the different varieties of cotton; the length, strength and fineness of their respective fibres, the various processes through which it has to pass before it reaches his hands; where it is grown; what is the yield per acre and the total money value of the crop; what is the extent of the area under cotton; what was the crop grown there previously which has been displaced, or was the area under question lying fallow before; what difference it would make to the cultivator if another crop were substituted in place of cotton; etc. Thus his practical experience will be illumined by scientific knowledge and give him such a firm grip of his subject and an insight into its intricacies that to master the other processes of carding prevailing in different parts of Andhra will become comparatively an easy thing for him and take but little time. If, further, he keeps regular notes of his experiments and experiences, they will in time take the place of an authoritative treatise on the science of carding.
 It will be thus seen that no khadi worker need leave his field of work in order to learn the science of khadi. If he is fired by the spirit
 of inquiry and has patience and capacity for concentrated application in a sufficient measure, he will , by applying himself to an intensive study of the processes for which his neighbourhood offers special facilities, not only become a specialist in those particular processes but also gradually widen the scope of his knowledge so as to deserve the name science.

 You must have read my questionnaire and Lakshmidas’s article.
We must have a book giving all that information.
Kamu writes that she has now started going to school.
 I read your printed programme. I didn’t like it as well as I did your statement. The portion in dialogue form is certainly excellent, but it can’t be said to have been artistically interwoven with the rest. That, however, is a minor defect. I notice spelling mistakes too. The Vidyapith dictionary is an authority for us. I don’t know if it contains the words peen, reeban, chipia, etc. If it, you should look them up. Now the dictionary does not at all give the word pin. In English the vowel is short and we should spell the word accordingly. I went through the rules about spelling and there also it is stated that words borrowed from foreign languages should be spelt in conformity with their spellings in those languages. Moreover, the word peen has a definite meaning in Gujarati. The dictionary explains it as “thick”, “wellfed”, “rounded”. At first sight I didn’t get the meaning of peen, but I made it out as I proceeded further. In the dialogue you have spelt the word as cheepeeo. It should be cheepio. It is followed in the same sentence by  reebanlibtech_44_footnotelibtech_45_footnote.  In English the  word  is  pronounced as“riban” and that is how it should be spelt according to the rule given in the dictionary. The word is not given in  the  dictionary, though there is no harm in using it all the same. You will find many more of similar other spelling mistakes.
 I see no poetry in the bhajan or song “He is the witless man”. The language jars on the ear and the thought also  is  none  too pleasant. The very first syllable augurs ill. There is no such word as murakh. The word is moorakh. The thought in the line “feeds the foreigner lovingly” is indicative of ill will. It does not befit a follower of non-violence. And if a foreigner is hungry, why should not one feed him lovingly? Of course the meaning in the author’s mind is different, but the reader is not concerned with the meaning in an auther’s mind if it is not expressed in his language. In the phrase, deshana dukkhne tane, the syllable “na”, should be nasalized. The expression “to serve the stones of unemployment” lacks moderation. The metaphor also is not happy. The thought in “The fine noose of
 
 the craze for fancifulness” is touched with bitterness. A noose cannot be discribed as “fine”, nor can it be said that the word “fine” has been used ironically. The word greeva is not in keeping with the author’s attempt to use rustic language. The spelling januni is incorrect. The word is janani. But I will not go on with this criticism. Go through the second part from this point of view. I felt the whole poem crabbed and unpleasant. The other song also didn’t interest me. I have not read it carefully, though. But Vidhatara did catch my eye. Nanavati suggests that it must have been a misprint. The author must have written Vidhatra. If that is correct, please note that the dictionary gives no word like Vidhatra. It gives Vidhata and Vidhatri. A poet has no right to alter spellings of words without sufficient reason.

46,"March 	12, 1937",LETTER TO RAIJI,"
         BHAI 	RAIJI,       March 	12, 1937 
  	I got your letter. It was good that you wrote. I could not agree 	with your argument. The idea of serving many aims in planning the 	construction of temples does not appeal to me. In my opinion, good 	lies in implementing all these ideas gradually. How can a person  	whom we would not like to keep in our house be permitted to stay in 	a temple? A temple should never be allowed to be a shelter for 	vagabonds. Only holy men are a worthy sight in a temple compound. If 	you brothers cherish the idea of making the temple God’s abode, 	then it is desirable that you do not transform it into a place of 	self- seeking. If your ideas are carried out, God will suffocate in 	that place although it may be called a temple. I would personally 	wish that you should never copy the failings of the Hindus who 	consider themselves as belonging to the upper castes. I may remind 	you that  Bhangi friends twice took an oath before me that they 	would give up drinking and twice broke it. But I too am made of 	ordinary clay as you are. So we need not put a high value on the 	knowledge that you may be able to gain from me, but, if you desire 	to make the temple a true abode of God, then do not make it a 	shelter for persons of doubtful worth and a place for storing 	utensils of use to the community.  Instead,  the moment the temple 	is opened you should take before the deity  
 installed inside a pledge to abjure drink, and cling to it; then although the temple may have taken only Rs. 5 to build instead of Rs. 5,000, it will still become a shrine of pilgrimage. I should like the place where Mama stays to be such a holy place, and a temple like that cannot be built by spending money. Now do what you and Mamasaheb think proper.

 "
47,,THE COW,"
  
 The cow is an object of worship and veneration to millions in India. I count myself among them. The cow-shed in Segaon is in front of me. I cannot escape its inmates even if I would. And when I was arguing the question of the masses of Harijans with Christian friends, I said, ‘The majority of Harijans can no more understand the presentation of Christianity than my cows.’ This comparision shocked my friends so much that the shock has travelled to America and I have begun to receive letters from America telling me how my comparision is being used to discredit me and my claim to serve Harijans. The critics seem to say, ‘You can have little regard for Harijans if you compare them to the cow.’
 Nevertheless I am unrepentant. My American credit will be little worth if it can be demolished on the very first shock however trivial it might be. But I hold that my comparison was as innocuous as it was appropriate. It was innocuous because of the unique place the cow occupies in India. It was appropriate because in the matter of understanding the presentation of Christianity the ordinary Harijan can no more take it in than the cow. That the dullest Harijan can be trained to understand it in course of time, whereas the cow never can, is irrelevant for the simple reason that the discussion related to the present condition, not to future possibility. My point would be better understood if I extend the comparision and say that my five-year old grandson or my sixty-eight-year old wife can no more understand the presentation than my cow, though both my wife and my grandson are objects of tender care and attention. I could say of myself that I can no more read the Chinese alphabet today than my worshipful cow.
 The truth of this last statement is not in any way altered by the fact that if someone began to teach my cow and me the difficult alphabet, I should beat the cow hollow, if the poor venerable mother ever consented to enter the competition. Let my critics and credulous friends understand that apart from the comparison, I stand on unassailable ground when I assert that it is a travesty of religion to seek to uproot from the Harijans’ simple minds such faith as they have in their ancestral religion and to transfer their allegiance to another,  even  though  that  other  may  be   as  good  as  and  equal   to the original in quality. Though all soils have the same predominantcharaterstics, we know that the same seeds do not fare equally well in all soils. I have some excellent tree cotton seeds which thrive excellently in certain parts of Bengal. But Mirabehn has not succeeded as yet in getting the same result from the same seeds in the Varoda soil. But I should be unable to subscribe to the formula, if the attempt was made to advance it, that the Varoda soil is inferior to the Bengal soil. But my fear is that though Christian friends nowadays do not say or admit that Hindu religion is untrue, they must harbour in their breasts the belief that Hinduism is an error and that Christianity as they believe it is the only true religion. Without some such thing it is not possible to understand, much less to appreciate, the C.M.S. appeal from which I reproduced in these columns some revealing extracts   the   other   day.libtech_48_footnotelibtech_49_footnoteOne    could   understand   the   attack    on untouchability and many other errors that have crept into Hindu life. And if they would help us to get rid of the admitted abuses and purify our religion, they would do helpful constructive work which would be gratefully accepted. But so far as one can understand the present effort, it is to uproot Hinduism from the very foundation and replace it by another faith. It is like an attempt to destroy a house which though badly in want of repair appears to the dweller quite decent and habitable. No wonder he welcomes those who show him how to repair it and even offer to do so themselves. But he would most decidedly resist those who sought to destroy the house that had served well him and his ancestors for ages, unless he, the dweller, was convinced that the house was beyond repair and unfit for human habitation. If the Christian world entertains that opinion about the Hindu house, ‘Parliament of Religions’ and  ‘International Fellowship’ are empty phrases. For both the terms presuppose
 
 equality of status, a common platform. There cannot be a common platform as between inferiors and superiors, or the enlightened and the unenlightened, the regenerate and the unregenerate, the high-born and the low-born, the caste man and the outcaste. My comparison may be defective, may even sound offensive. My reasoning may be unsound. But my proposition stands.
 Harijan, 13-3-1937
 "
48,,ANDREWS ON TRAVANCORE,"
  
Deenbandhu Andrews writes:
 The arrival of each new number of Harijan is one of the exciting events of the week in my old college rooms at Cambridge, where I have been busy lecturing this term: but this morning the paper exceeded my highest expectation. For it told me of the wonderful visit to Travancore, and the joy of the Harijans as they entered the temples freely to meet you and take part in the prayers which you conducted within the temple walls. Many years ago, I had gone down into Travancore at your request—both to Vaikom,  where  I witnessed the great Satyagraha struggle, and also to Kottayam. Outside Kottayam, in the country district, multitudes of the avarnas had come to meet
 me and to receive your message. At one place, nearly two thousand had collected. Their misery and suffering haunted me afterwards and I could not think of anything else. Again, at Vaikom where I stayed with the Satyagrahis,  I saw once more the misery and suffering of those who were prevented from going on the road outside the temple. On that occasion, I went and pleaded with the Nambudiri Brahmins, but in vain. Now it was wonderful beyond measure to read how that old Satyagraha struggle, with all its bravery and endurance, had at last found its completion! For not merely the roads but the temple itself had been entered by the savarnas and avarnas together! What I now long to hear is this, that some at least of Nambudiri Brahmins, who have so truly sought to undo the harm done in the past, may also be led to offer to these Harijans, whom they have thus welcomed as brothers, a brotherly wage for the full work which they perform. Only in that brotherly way can the victory become complete.
From all I hear, the Proclamation is being worked so effectively
 that the economic salvation which Deenbandhu wants to hear of is bound to come and that sooner than one may expect. For, addressing a   meeting  of   Pulayas,   Pariahs   and   others   on   the   Ist   instant at
 Trivandrum, the Dewan Sir C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar is reported to have said:
 The Maharaja regarded the Temple-entry Proclamation not as an end in itself, but as the first step in the rehabilitation of the State. What was needed was educational upliftment, economic upliftment and social integration. For this, the co-operation of the Ruler and the people was necessary. Out of consi- deration for the class of people who were being lifted up, it had been decided to omit the word ‘depressed’ from Government documents and publications. He ventured to say the time would come when the Depressed Classes would forget that name.

49,,MARRIED BRAHMACHARYAlibtech_50_footnote,"
  
A friend writes:
 I have long since held with you that self-control is the only sovereign method for attaining birth-control. That the sexual act is  meant  for  procreation only, and apart from it, in any shape or form , would amount to unnatural gratification of lust, needs no proof. But sometimes this brings one up against a grave dilemma. Supposing that the sexual act, once or twice, fails to lead to conception, what is one to do then? Where is one to draw the limit?  It is hard finally to give up all hope of begetting offspring. On the other hand, unlimited indulgence in the sexual act must result in the man being drained of all vitality. Again, should such a person be told to regard his failure to beget progeny on the first or the second chance, as a mark of adverse fate and on that score to abstain from having any further intercourse thereafter? But that would require an exceptional degree of self-possession and spiritual strength on the part of the person concerned. Instances of people begetting progeny in their declining years after repeated failure during the years of manhood and youth are by no means either unknown or rare. That makes the observance of complete abstinence still more difficult, and the position becomes further complicated when the parties happen to be otherwise healthy and free from any physical defect.
I  admit  the   difficulty,   but   the   difficulty   is  inherent   in the
 problem itself. The road to any progress is strewn with  such difficulties and the story of man’s ascent in the scale of evolution is co-extensive with the history of the successful overcoming of these
 
 difficulties. Take the story of the attempts to conquer the Himalayas. The higher you go the steeper becomes the climb, the more difficult the ascent, so much so that its highest peak still remains unvanquished.The enterprise has already exacted a heavy toll of sacrifice. Yet every year sees fresh attempts made only to end in failure like their predecessors. All that has, however, failed to damp the spirit of the explorers. If that is the case with the conquest of the Himalayas, what about the conquest of self, which is a harder job by far, even as the reward is richer? The scaling of the the Himalayas can, at best, give a temporary feeling of elation and triumph. But the  reward of the conquest of self is a spiritual bliss that knows no waning and grows ever more and more. It is a welll-known maxim of the science of brahmacharya that insemination in the case of a man who has properly kept the rules of brahmacharya cannot, ought not to, fail to lead to conception. And this is just as it should be. When a man has completely conquered his animality, involuntary incontinence becomes impossible, and the desire for sexual gratification for its own sake ceases altogether. Sexual union then takes place only when there is a desire for offspring. This is the meaning of what has been described as ‘married brahmacharya’. In other words, a person who obeys this rule, though leading a married life, attains the same state as, and is equal in merit to, one who completely abstains from the sexual act, which is only a means for procreation, never for self-indulgence. In practice, it is true, this ideal is seen to be rarely realized in its completeness. But in shaping our ideals we cannot think in terms of our weaknesses or the possible lapses. The present tendency,  however,  is to take a complete swing round, and the protagonists of contraceptives have almost set up self-indulgence as their ideal. Self- indulgence obviously can never be an ideal. There can be no limit to the practice of an ideal. But unlimited self-indulgence, as everybody would admit, can only result in certain destruction of the individual or the race concerned. Hence self-control alone can be our ideal, and it has been so regarded from the earliest times. Therefore we have to explore the means of its attainment, not to circumvent it.
 It has become my settled conviction that most of the difficulties that are experienced in connection with the practice of brahmacharya are due to our ignorance about its laws and would of themselves disappear if we discovered them. Let us, for instance, examine the poser propounded by our correspondent in the ideal light. In the ideal state, in the first place, such a contingency will never arise, because in a normally healthy couple, who have from their childhood upward observed the rules of brahmacharya, sexual union can never prove
 infertile. In practice, however, anomalies do arise. The only rule that can be laid down in such instances is that coitus may be permittedonce at the end of the monthly period till conception is established. If its object is achieved it must be adjured forthwith, for mere sensual gratification should never be its object. It is my faith based on my experience that bodily and mental health increases in the same ratio as bodily and mental chastity. Nor is it to be wondered at. A substance that is capable of producing such a wounderful being as man, cannot but be transmuted into matchless energy and strength. Anyone can test for himself the truth of this observation of the Shastras for himself by personal experience. And the rule holds good in respect of woman no less than man. The real difficulty, however, is that we vainly expect to be free from outward manifestations of lust, while harbouring it in our minds, with the result that physically and mentally we become utter wrecks, and our lives, in the words of the Gita become a living lie or hypocrisy personified.

    BHAI 	PARIKSHITLAL,  March 	13, 1937 
  	I got your letter. The description of the Harijan school at Edarpura 	appears to be good but I refrain from publishing it. There have been 	instances in the past when, after a favourable description about a 	school or an institution was received and published, our subsequent 	experience of it was bitter. Either we do not have the courage to 	publish such experience or it seems improper to do so. If, however, 	one occasionally comes across a description like the one you have 	given, one may derive what joy one can from it and then forget about 	it. One would then be saved from the kind of embarrassing situation 	mentioned above. If it is a really good school, it will surely go on 	progressing. Such a school cares for no praise. I have not seen many 	reasons to hope that because of our description of a school others 	will immediately copy its example. However, I have not made it a 	rule in my mind that such descriptions should never be published. 	Whenever, therefore, you feel it very necessary to publish a 	particular description, please write to me.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 3956

53,,"THE PROBLEM OF THE
HANDLOOMlibtech_53_footnote","
  
 The following figures represent the aggregate out-turn of handlooms using both inigenous and foreign mill yarn up to 1934:
       YEAR 				     AVERAGE 				OUT-TURN 				OF CLOTH IN HUNDRED 				THOUSAND 				YARDS     1911-14   ..	101     1921-24   ..	117     1925-28   ..	124     1930   ..	134     1931   ..	134     1932   ..	140     1933   ..	172     1934   ..	170    
 It is difficult to say how far these figures are reliable. But I think it may safely be assumed that if they err at all it is on the side of understatement. The actual production of the handlooms is probably higher. We ought to be able to convert all these handlooms to the use of hand-spun yarn, but we are powerless to do  that  today.  Our charkha yarn today is neither of sufficient strength nor is it produced in sufficient quantity. So long as we cannot produce hand-spun yarn that will stand comparison with the mill yarn in strength and uninformity, the handloom weaver will refuse to handle it and for very good reason too. In the first place, the employement of weak and uneven yarn reduces the quantity of cloth that he can turn out in a given time and thus affects his earning capacity. Secondly, the handloom weaver today has specialized more or less in higher lines of production while our output of hand-spun yarn of fine count is extremely meagre and that too is confined mostly to Andhra. The solution of the difficulty involves a complete mastery of the khadi science. But I am not asking anybody to tackle this problem today. It can for the present wait. There are a number of other problems whichwill have to be successfully tackled before we can cope with the question of the handloom. Only let it be borne in mind that this
 
 problem will have to be successfully tackled before the dream of universalizing khadi is realized.

 Asked for his comments on the resolutionlibtech_78_footnoteof the A. I. C. C., Gandhiji said:
 This is not now within my province. I being now aloof from the day-to-day activities of the Congress, it is not for me to forecast how the resolution would work out in the actualities of provincial politics. My interest at present is confined to that of tendering advice and assisting in draftinglibtech_79_footnote.
 Denying very firmly any intention to make office-acceptance virtually impossible, he said:
The resolution is a downright honest resolution, without the
 slightest mental reservation but it must be read as an indivisible whole. If Governors want Congressmen to take office, I can see nothing in the resolution to make it even awkward to them to give the fullest satisfaction to the Congress leaders in their representative Provinces– this of course within the very limited sphere in which Provincial Governors have discretion and the resolution has asked for nothing more. Any leader summoned by the Governor in terms of the Act to form his Cabinet will naturally use the Congress resolution by way of illustration and he will ask for an assurance in cases covered by the resolution.
 Asked if he would indicate some of the details of the plan of work of Congress Ministries, Gandhiji said that that could be best done by those who were likely to be  in office themselves.

 "
70,,ENFORCED WIDOWHOOD,"
  
 Pyarelal has unearthed the following instructive extract on the suttee and widowhood from the treatise on universal histroy by Diodorus the Sicilian who lived in the age of Julius Caesar.
 Now it was an ancient law among the Indians that when young men and maidens were minded to wed they did not marry according to the judgment of the parents, but by mutual consent. But when espousals were made between
 persons of immature age, mistakes of judgment were of frequent occurrence, and when both sides repented their union, many of the women  became depraved, and through incontinence fell in love with other men, and when at last they wished to leave the husbands they had first chosen, but could not in decency do so openly, they got rid of them by poison, a means of destroying life which they could readily procure in their country which produces in great quantity and variety drugs of fatal potency, some of which cause death if merely introduced as powder into food and drink. But when this nefarious practice had become quite prevalent, and many lives had been sacrificed, and when it was found that the punishment of the guilty had no effect in deterring other wives from their career of iniquity, they passed a law ordaining that a wife, unless she was pregnant or had already borne children, should be burned along with the deceased husband, and that if she did not choose to obey the law she sould remain a widow to the end of her life, and be for ever excomm- unicated from the sacrifices and other solemnities as being an impious person.
 If these extracts give a faithful account of the origin of the two inhuman customs, we have reason to thank Heavens for the suppression of the suttee by law imposed upon us. No outside impo- sition can cure Hindu society of the enforced widowhood of girls who don’t even know what marriage is. The reform can come first by the force of enlightened public opinion among Hindus, secondly by parents recognizing the duty of marrying their girl widows. This they can do, where the girls’ consent is lacking, by educating their minds to the correctness of their marrying. Naturally this refers  to  girls  under age. Where the so-called widows have grown to maturity and they do not desire to marry, nothing is necessary save to tell them that they are free to marry precisely as if they were maidens unmarried. It is difficult to break the chains of prisoners who hug them, mis- taking them as ornaments, as girls and even grown-up women do regard their silver or golden chains and rings as ornaments.

 "
71,,AN ILLUSION,"
  
 I received this letterlibtech_80_footnotelast November. But owing to pressure of work I could not write anything up till now. The writer is a scholar of
 
 Lahore. It is surprising that he should be labouring under such a grave misapprehension. Perhaps the recent miracle of Travancore has removed his misapprehension. Still there are many people  who harbour such misconceptions. So, it would be better to reply to his letter.
 In Travancore the Harijans behind the strong movement for temple-entry were not wanting in money. Their leader was, and still is, Shri Govindan, an ex-judge of Travancore. Money brought them no peace. Temple-entry has brought them peace; we witness it for ourselves. They are very pleased with the Maharaja and Maharani. Even if the Maharaja had bestowed half his kingdom on them, it would not have achieved what temple-entry has achieved. This miracle shows that man values many things more than wealth. Man sacrifices his all for self-respect. People have suffered many hardships in the cause of religion, and have even embraced death for it.
 When Hindus observe untouchability towards non-Hindus, there is certainly hatred in it. But as the non-Hindus are strong, they do not feel it as much as the Harijans do, who in spite of belonging to the same religion are considered untouchables.
 It is also not right to say that there are restrictions in the matter of eating and drinking even among the four castes. The difference between this and untouchability is like that between an elephant and an ant. Untouchables are outcastes. However rich they may be, if they do anything outside their custom they are flogged. It is my firm belief that Hindus alone are responsible for the grievances of the Harijans. They have made injustice their dharma. To describe their problem as an economic one is tantamount to denying their present situation.
 From the way this correspondent writes it appears that though he is a Hindu, he keeps himself a little outside the Hindu society. There are no Brahmins who are hated by Rajputs or any other caste Hindus. On the other hand, we find that a Brahmin or any other caste Hindu is worshipped even by the rich if he embraces poverty.
 In the end, even after having read the correspondent’s letter with due care and courtesy, I do not regret anything I have said or done regarding untouchability.

 March 20, 1937
 Although I am a prisoner of Jawaharlal and I am bound by his orders, at present I am concentrating my attention on village work and that too in Segaon.
 Thus reported Mahatma Gandhi to Pandit Indra, Chairman of the Reception Committee of the Congress Conventionlibtech_81_footnote, and others who had gone to request him to attend today’s session of the Convention. Gandhiji added:
 I have chosen one particular course of action and cannot think of anything else. At present, my mind moves in that direction. When I am able to present something before you, I shall come without your asking. There is meaning in my sitting in the village. My hopes are brightening.
 When requested to address a meeting of villagers here, Gandhiji replied:
My eyes are on Segaon now.

73,,KHADI WORK IN A SCHOOL,"
  
 A national school was founded in Rajkot sixteen years ago chiefly through the efforts of the late Shri Revashankar  Jagjivan Jhaveri and with the help of Shri Jamnadas Gandhi. Last month, its sixteenth anniversary was celebrated under the chairmanship of Shri Narahari Parikh. There are three sections in that school–the Vinay, the Kumar and the Bal Mandir. In all, 190 students–110 boys and 80 girls–are studying there. I quote below a paragraph from Shri Narandas Gandhi’s statementlibtech_82_footnotelibtech_83_footnotethat deserves attention.
 It is a matter for rejoicing that interest can be created in this way in khadi amongst girls and boys. It is significant to note that cotton too is grown in the school, that a dairy is run and foodstuff necessary
 
 C. members which met in Delhi on March 19 and 20 to administer to the legislators an oath of national independence and allegiance to the Indian people, prior to their taking of the oath in the form in vogue avowing loyalty to the British Sovereign
 for a balanced diet also prepared there. If these activities are properly developed and the boys and girls are taught in the skills needed for them in a manner which they would understand, their minds would truly develop. It is an illusion to believe that  a  child’s  intellect develops by cramming it with facts which have no relevance to his life. These may well provide entertainment to the intellect, they cannot develop it, because their intellect will not be able to discriminate. But whenever a boy or a girl has to perform some activity and that activity is not taught to him in a mechanical fashion but the reason behind each activity is explained, in such cases the child’s intellect develops readily, he acquires self-awareness, self-respect and self-reliance.

  On or before March 22, 1937]libtech_85_footnoteQuestion: It 	is all right 	that you teach us 	tailoring and 	high-class shoe- making. But that is not what our villagers want. We must learn something that our  villagers 	need.  	Answer: You are partly right and partly wrong. The villagers may not 	need these things, but the city people need them. Why should they 	not depend on you rather than others for these things? If thereby a 	living contact can be established between the cities and the 	villages, it will be very good. You have got to teach the villagers 	whatever you learn here.  Q. 	If we are to do tanning and scavenging which are the occupations of 	our forefathers and which have kept us untouchables for centuries, 	how are you going to destroy untouchability?     
 A. Not by asking you to give up the occupation of your forefathers but by doing it ourselves. Don’t you know that I am a master-scavenger? But nobody treats me as an untouchable. Why should they then treat you as an untouchable? And if they treated you as a touchable only after you give up professions which are so useful to the community, where is the merit? Untouchability will not be removed that way. For then they will treat as untouchables those who will next do these unclean tasks. Untouchability cannot be destroyed that way. It can be destroyed by the so-called untouchables also doing the unclean tasks, and by impressing on the orthodox that however unclean those tasks, they are as honourable as any other and more useful than many.

 With regard to the first questionlibtech_87_footnote, Gandhiji said that he would give his attention to that. Reverting to the second question libtech_88_footnotehe said:
 There is no cause dearer to my life than the cause of Hindu- Muslim unity and since. I have taken up this cause I have staked my life on several occasions on this issue.

 Mahatmaji, however, told the Jamiat leaders that he had been pondering over fresh avenues of real Hindu-Muslim unity. Mahatmaji thought that the present  situation when the Congress has been returned in a majority in elections in most of the Provinces might help in this task.

  March 	25, 1937  CHI. 	KANTIlibtech_94_footnote,  	I could not write to you earlier. I had a talk with Devdas. If you 	wish to go to Mysore, you may do so. If the expenses increase by 	your going there, Devdas will earn the money or raise it. It is, 	therefore, not necessary for you to join Wilson [College, Bombay] 	for want of money or Devdas’s consent. You may go to Trivandrum if 	you like. If you get a cargo ship and desire to go by it, there is 	no objection. It is certainly good to travel thus. Devdas will bear 	the expense of the voyage, but if he does not, then you may ask me 	for it. It would not be proper to take it from me if he can bear it.  	I know Devdas could not see you. On my asking him he told me that he 	had tried to see you but could not. He did not send for you because 	his programme was uncertain. One should not mind such things. And in 	any case one should never be suspicious. You may take from Nimu or 	Ramdas whatever money you immediately need. We, i.e., Ba, Manu, Kanu 	(Junior), Mahadev, Pyarelal and I are leaving for Madras today. We 	shall be there for three days, and shall be back on the   31st. It 	has almost been decided to have Manu’s weddinglibtech_95_footnotein Hudli.     
 Did you cancel your proposed trip to Rajkot? Do you wish to have Amtul Salaam with you? She thinks that you do, but Devdas’s impression and mine is that you do not. If that is the case, please write to her frankly. She is making herself needlessly unhappy. She was with me in Delhi as long as I was there.
 My language need not be considered mathematical just because I use mathematical terms. But if it is as exact as mathematics, that is, if its successive steps in reasoning are logical and exact, it may be described as mathematical. If my language has that quality, it  is because of my worship of truth.
 One who wants to learn only a subject of intellectual study can very well do so from a person without character, and such a person may certainly be intelligent also. For instance, a craftsman without character may be highly proficient in his craft. But the highest intelligence or craftsmanship without good character can never do good to the world or serve it. The effect of such service will be temporary. That is why the Gita says: “Worship me and I will give you intelligence and whatever else you need”. “Worship me”means ‘serve me–my creation’.
 After writing these sheets I went to the ‘library’ and after returning I am now drinking milk and am dictating this while doing so. I had taken your letter to the ‘library’, just to see whether I had omitted to reply to any point. I am replying in brief to what has been left out. A self-controlled man should be busy in service for all the twenty-four hours. If it is merely doing anything even a demon can do it. This is in the character of a Ravana. But such a person cannot be regarded as a self-controlled man. Activity is threefold: of body, mind and soul. In pure service there is a combination of the three.
 I do know that it is not an easy task to interpret ahimsa in mathematical language. I am trying to do that. And what is true of ahimsa is also true of all other things, e.g., spinning, village industries, etc. But perhaps you will understand all this on your own if you start reading the three journalslibtech_96_footnotelibtech_97_footnote.  I  am  expecting  from  you  work  of  that level. I have torn up your letter. Nothing from it will pass to Delhi. If you decide to go to Trivandrum, and if you do not take a ship and if you can free yourself from there, then why not join us in Madras?

83,"March 26, 1937","SPEECH AT DAKSHIN BHARAT HINDI PRACHAR SABHA, MADRASlibtech_98_footnote","
  
 March 26, 1937
 Mahatmaji expressed his intention to speak in Hindi and . . . said:
 It is not my purpose to hear my own voice. I would like that you should all hear it and, what is more important, understand it; for otherwise there can be neither pleasure nor profit in speaking. So kindly raise your hands, those who understand me–partially or fully.
 A good number of hands went up.
 And now those who cannot understand me, please put up your hands.
 Gandhiji looked round at those with lifted hands and seeing Mr. G. A. Natesan among them cried out:
Shame, shame!
 “It is a shame,”Mr. Natesan agreed and added, “and I am very sorry indeed.” Gandhiji at once took the opportunity to impress upon those present the need for learning Hindi:
You understand on whom I have just now cried shame. It is my
 good old friend, Mr. Natesan. Of course, I would not take that liberty with others. I have known him since 1915 when I came here from South Africa and he and I understand each other. He is a great publisher and editor. He has also brought out translations of great Sanskrit works. He has enthusiasm and youthfulness for such work. But what has he done in regard to Hindi? He may say, ‘Oh I am old.’ Perhaps, he is, in body. But let not the mind get old. Let it go on adding to its store of knowledge. For, one whose  mind  has  not become old can do great good to himself and to his fellowmen.
 There are still some persons–happily, they are very few–who seem to consider it a sin to look upon  Hindi-Hindustani as  the national language and a greater sin to study it. I can say from my experience that those who recognize the place of Hindi as the national language will take to its study with enthusiasm and earnestness, whether it be their mother tongue or not. Otherwise, they may not be able to contribute to its growth as the national language. Hindi cannot take the place of the different provincial languages nor is that the aim of Hindi prachar. On the other hand, the spread of the national
 
 language will accelerate the growth of the provincial languages and vice versa. A strong and virile national language requires healthy development of the provincial languages. If the latter be weak and anaemic, how can the former at all grow?libtech_99_footnote
 Gujarati, I said to myself, cannot be the language. Not more than a thirtieth part of the people of the country speaks it. How am I to find Tulsi Ramayana  therein? What about Marathi, then, I wondered. I love Marathi. I claim among the Marathi-speaking people some staunch co-workers. I know the Maharastrians’ efficiency, capacity for self-sacrifice, and their learning. And yet I did not think Marathi–the language that Lokamanya Tilak wielded so wonderfully well–could be our rashtrabhasha. When I was thus reasoning this out, let me tell you that I did not know the actual number of people speaking Hindi, and yet I instinctively felt that only Hindi could take that place, and no other. Did I not appreciate Bengali? I did, and I thought highly of it as the language of Chaitanya, Ram Mohun Roy, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and Rabindranath Tagore. And yet I felt that we could not make even Bengali the language of inter-provincial intercourse.libtech_100_footnote
 I was convinced long ago, and my conviction has  grown  stronger since from experience, that if any Indian language can ever become India’s national language–and some one must become the national language if Indians are to become a nation–that language was only Hindi, and I have always directed my efforts in its cause.
 No doubt, in the South we are up against a great problem in this matter. But we cannot see how a language of the South, Tamil or Telugu or any other, can serve as the national language. I honestly tried to learn Telugu and Tamil. Indeed there was a time when I could speak in Tamil quite as well as I am now speaking Hindi. I had sufficient material when I was in South Africa to assist me in this, because I had to work in the midst of Tamils. but I must confess, to my regret and shame, that I have not kept up touch with it and have forgotten what little I knew of that language. I am not wholly responsible for it. The blame for it rests partly on my Tamil friends. I have   taken   a   girllibtech_101_footnotefrom   Tamil   Nad   into   my   household   as   my daughter-in-law. But instead of compelling me to keep touch with Tamil, she has learnt Hindi and Gujarati and speaks and writes in
 
 Hindi. What can I do? How can I hope to refresh my knowledge of Tamil when Tamilians let me down in this manner?
 Nor is my Hindi particularly good. My friends behind, who are all proficient in Hindi, laugh at my Hindi  pronunciation  and grammar. I know both are erratic for I have not studied either. It will do for my purpose if I am able to express my thoughts so as to be understood. If I attempt to be grammatical, I am afraid the results will not be very complimentary to me. I must, on this occasion, express my regret at the absence of any book to help Hindi-speaking people to learn Tamil. If they want to learn Tamil, they have to do it through English. We have not shown the zeal in this cause which some Western Missionaries have evinced. I would appeal to Tamils and also my North Indian friends to remedy this defect. I am thankful to my South Indian friends for the enthusiasm they have shown in learning Hindi but I must say it is not sufficient. It is a unique event that the session of the All-India Sahitya Sammelan is being held in Madras, where Tamil is the chief language. Tamil, of all the Dravidian languages, has borrowed least from Sanskrit. This, no doubt, is a handicap to Tamilians in learning Hindi. But still they have striven to learn the language.libtech_102_footnote
 I certainly congratulate you on what you have achieved. But I should be satisfied only when distinguished people like my friend G.
  Natesan, 	member of 	the Council 	of State, 	give half an hour 	each day 	to the 	study of 	Hindi. Let 	him not plead old 	age. If 	he is not too 	old to 	edit the 	Indian Review, if 	he is not too old to 	study Sanskrit and 	issue Sanskrit publications one 	after another, if 	he is not too old to 	go to the Council of State, why should he be too old to learn Hindi? 
 What I mean to say is this. Up till now only the middleclass people have taken up the study of Hindi. When will our distinguished leaders take it up? When will the Advocate-General find half an hour to leave his briefs aside and devote it to Hindi? I want men and women among the most distinguished of the South to study Hindi.

84,,SHAMEFUL IF TRUE,"
  
A correspondent in British Malabar writes:libtech_103_footnote
 I desire you kindly to comment on the following incident which has agitated me considerably. A public procession was organized by the Congress workers of our village on the eve of the General Elections to the Assembly. A Harijan boy of the place wished to go along with  the procession. But the organizers requested him to keep away, mildly saying to him, ‘Of course, as you know, we are in full sympathy with you. But the procession has to go through by-lanes along which you people are not generally allowed. Then again, we fear that the orthodox may make this a plea for voting against the Congress. We, therefore, consider it prudent that you do not accompany us.’ The  poor  boy  returned  with  a  heavy  heart. . . .
 This ill-treatment of the noble Harijan lad, if the report is true, deserves severe condemnation, and victory at elections or in other matters is not worth anything if it is bought with the suppression of Harijan liberty. The prohibition against Harijans making use of the roads in the place mentioned is an illegal act and ought not to be tolerated for a single day. Workers should reason with the objectors, and if they do not listen, a test case should be made by taking a few Harijans through the prohibited streets. One would have thought that in Malabar at least such things as are described by the correspondent would not happen.

85,,A VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS,"
  
 Just lately I read a review of your conferencelibtech_104_footnotewith Mrs. Sanger, the birth-control advocate. I was so deeply moved that I am writing you to express my appreciation for your stand. God bless you for your courage. . . .
 I realize it will take centuries to educate the public to higher ideals, but there is no time like the present to begin. I fear she mistakes passion for love, for love is of the spirit and never born of lust.
 Dr. Alexis Carrel agrees with you, in that sex control is not harmful except to those who feed their passions and are already unbalanced. Mrs. Sanger is wrong in saying that most doctors believe abstinence is harmful. I find many leading doctors and scientists belonging to the American Social Hygiene Association hold that control is beneficial.
 You are doing a noble work.	You are one of the few who have this
 higher spiritual viewpoint on the sex question. . . .
 Let us keep up the good work so that youth may know the truth, for the hope of the future is in their hands.
 I  add a  quotation from one of  my  talks to boys:   “.	Creation–
 physical, mental and spiritual–is joy and life.  If you  are merely  seeking  the sensations of the flesh with no thought of creating, or even trying to avoid the aim of creation you are perverting nature and killing your spiritual powers. ”
 I know this is like a prophet crying in the wilderness, but  I  am  convinced of the truth of it, and I can but point the way.
This is one of the letterslibtech_105_footnotelibtech_106_footnotewhich I occasionally get from America
 in condemnation of the use of contraceptives. Current literature that India imports weekly from the Far West would have us believe that in America none but idiots and imbeciles oppose the use of this modern method of deliverance from the bondage of the superstition which imprisons the body and crushes it by denying  it its supreme enjoyment. That literature produces as much momentary intoxication as the act which it teaches and incites us to perform without incurring the risk of its oridinary result. I do not put before the readers of Harijan merely letters of individual condemnation received from the West. They have their use for me as a seeker but very little for the general reader. This letter, however, from a teacher of boys with thirty years’ experience behind him has a definite value. It should serve as a guide for Indian teachers and the public–men and women–who are carried away by the overwhelming tide. The use of contraceptives is infinitely more tempting than the whisky bottle. But it is not more lawful than the sparkling liquid for its fatal temptation. Nor can opposition to the use of either be given up in despair because their use seems to be growing. If the opponents have faith in their mission, it has to be pursued. A voice in the wilderness has a potency which voices uttered in   the midst of  ‘the madding crowd’ lack. For   the
 
 voice in the wilderness has meditation, deliberation and unquenchable faith behind it, whilst the babel of voices has generally nothing but the backing of the experience of personal enjoyment or the false and sentimental pity for the unwanted children and  their  suffering mothers. Argument of personal experience has as much weight as an act of a drunkard. The argument of pity is a trap into which it is dangerous to fall. Sufferings of unwanted children and of equally unwanted motherhood are punishments or warnings devised by beneficent nature. Disregard of the law of discipline and restraint is suicide. Ours is a state of probation. If we refuse to bear the yoke of discipline we court failure like cowards, we avoid battle and give up the only joy of living.
 Harijan, 27-3-1937
 "
86,,THE MEANING OF IT,"
  
 I have a wire from Gwalior saying that the notice board in Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain, prohibiting the entry into it of Harijans and those who may be associating with or working with them, has been withdrawn by the Maharaja. Before one can pronounce an opinion on the notice it is necessary to know its full meaning. If the prohibition is not withdrawn but only the offending notice board is, the withdrawal brings no relief to the insulted Harijans and their caste associates. It may even bring punishment to the unwary who seeing the notice board withdrawn may venture to enter the temple. If it means withdrawal of the prohibition itself, one would expect a notification to that effect. And if the prohibition is withdrawn from one temple, why not from all State-owned temples of which I am informed there are nearly fifty in Gwalior State? I hope, therefore, that the State authorities will clear the point and tell the public what the withdrawal of the notice board means.
 Indeed there seems to be a timidity on the part of the Princes and their advisers on this matter of doing elementary justice to the poorest and the neediest of their people, and that, too, in a matter which has first-class religious value but which costs them nothing materially. The most striking example of Travancore should have shown them that if they threw open their temples to Harijans there would be no resentment. But it may be that the Princes are afraid of the middle-class Hindus with whom they come in daily contact and that they are not concerned about the silent sufferers–the bulk of the poorest–whether they be Harijans or others. Save for a few Princes who may be counted on the fingers of one’s hands the vast majority have themselves no religious scruples about untouchability. Must the
 Hindu Princes who are supposed to be custodians of the faith, as is shown by the titles they assume, continue to neglect this obvious duty of throwing open their temples to Harijans? I drew attention the other daylibtech_107_footnoteto the title of the Maharaja of Travancore. Now I learn from D.
  Har Bilas  Sarda 	 that  the  Maharajas  of 	 Oodeyporelibtech_108_footnotelibtech_109_footnoteare  entitled 	Diwans inasmuch as 	they are ministers 	of the 	deity of their 	clan, and that whenever they visit 	their temples in 	Oodeypore they officiate 	like priests 	for the deity. 	I would 	therefore respectfully 	urge the 	Princes and 	their advisers boldly 	and unequivocally 	to throw 	open the temples 	in their 	respective States and 	prove themselves worthy 	trustees of their 	faith.

 I am very glad to communicate to you the very good news regarding the settlement of troubles between a big section of the Nattars called the ‘Tennilai Nattars’and the Harijans of that locality.
 The following is the true translation of the agreement entered into between the heads of both the parties:
 ‘COPY OF THE AGREEMENT DATED FEBURARY 24, 1937
 We, the Harijans and Nattars of Tennilai Nadu, have in the presence of Smt. Kamala Sivasubramaniam, Secretary, Harijan Sevak Sangh,
 Karaikudi, today resolved to forget and forgive all the differences in the past between the two communities. In token thereof we have set our hand to the conditions of the agreement referred to below:
  The 	Harijans will 	not be forced 	to do labour. 	They are at 	perfect liberty 	to take 	wages for the work 	they do and refuse 	to do work 	for those 	who do 	not pay.  Wearing 	of dress: 	The Harijans 	are entitled 	to use 	shirts and 	upper clothes 	as they 	like, and the women 	all kinds 	of ornaments 	as they 	please. But on 	the car-day festival of 	Kandadevi and 	Eluvancottah, the 	males will not 	wear shirts as the chief Nattars themselves do not do so.  The 	Harijans can 	build any type of houses 	they please 	according to their 	wishes and capacities.

 VEMBAN	P. N. KARUPPAIAH AMBALAN KALIAN	C. KARUPPIAH AMBALAN
S. RAMASWAMI	P. CHIDAMBARA AMBALAN
 S. PARANCHODHI PILLAI.’
 This is indeed good news, and those who brought about the agreement deserve congratulations. One may hope also that the terms will be strictly observed by the Nattars. But it is humiliating to find that a portion of Indian humanity cannot wear the dress or ornaments they like and receive wages for their labour except by the grace of another supposed to be superior to them but in reality no better than the first.

  March 	27, 1937  OBSTINACY		REFUSING		ASSURANCESlibtech_110_footnote WILL	SURELY	RESULT 	DEADLOCK.	BREACH	CONGRESS	RANKS	IMPOSSIBLE.  GANDHI  From 	a photostat: G.N. 1504         March 	27, 1937  	The Mahamahopadhyaya’s speech has whetted my appetite for a study 	of Tamil, which neither age nor desire would deter me from 	undertaking, but only the want of time makes difficult. The object 	of this conference is to collect gems from all provincial 	literatures and to make them available through Hindi. For this 	purpose I would make an appeal to you. Of course everyone must know 	his own language thoroughly well, and he should also know the great 	literature of other Indian languages through Hindi. But it is also 	the object of this conference to stimulate in our people the desire 	to know languages of other provinces, e.g., Gujaratis should know 	Tamil, Bengalis should    
 know Gujarati and so on. And I tell you from experience that it is not at all difficult to pick up another Indian language. But to this end a common script is quite essential. It is not difficult to achieve in Tamil Nad. For look at this simple fact: over 90 per cent of our people are illiterate. We have to start with a clean state with them. Why should we not start making them literate by means of a common script? In Europe they have tried the experiment of a common script quite successfully. Some people even go the length of saying that we might adopt the Roman script from Europe. After a good  deal of controversy there is a consensus of opinion that the common script can be Devnagari and none else. Urdu is claimed as a rival, but I think neither Urdu nor Roman has the perfection and phonetic capacity of Devnagari. Please remember that I say nothing  against  your languages. Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada must be there and will be there. But why not teach the illiterate in these parts these languages through the Devnagari script? In the interest of the national unity we desire to achieve, the adoption of Devnagari as a common script is so essential. Here it is a question of just shedding our provincialism and narrowness, there are no difficulties at all. Not that I do not like Tamil or Urdu scripts. I know both. But service of the motherland, to which all my life is being given and without which life would be insupp- ortable for me, has taught me that we should try to lift unneccessary burdens off our people. The burden of knowing many scripts is unnecessary and easily avoidable. I would appeal to men of letters of all provinces to resolve their differences on this point and be agreed on this matter of prime importance. Then and then only can the Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad be a success.
 Then you have to think of ways and means for carrying on our work.  Hans  is now defunct.libtech_112_footnotelibtech_113_footnoteIts founder was Premchandji who is no more. Unfortunately Premchandji did not leave anyone to take his place. Indeed, there was none that could adequately fill his place, for he was an unrivalled writer. But that was not the reason for  the stopping of the Hans. It ceased even when he was alive. Its cessation was due–it was a pity–to the paucity of the number of men who sympathized with or took sufficient interest in the method of work adopted by the journal. All the articles there were  drawn  from different provincial languages and were written in the Nagari script. If
 
 you accept the ideal of a common script, it would be your duty to earnestly work for this objective of the Parishad.
 Kakasaheb has told you that he is issuing periodical booklets now, but the whole thing cannot yet be said to have caught on. I want you to shed your apathy and lend a helping hand. You  must remember that the whole work falls on the shoulders of the chief workers of the Sammelan. Our work suffers not for want of funds, but for want of workers. We want them from every province. Kakasaheb said that we had limited the number of our governing body to 50 members, but that does not mean that it does not want more workers.
 Today our literature is in the interest of the few, i.e., of the few literates. Even among the literates there would be few who are really interested in literature.
 Our country lives in the villages, but we have not gone to the villages to do the country’s work. What I saw in Segaon is to be seen in every Indian village. You will be surprised that out of about six hundred villagers in Segaon, not two can read good literature. Every day a gentleman goes to the village to read out to them the day’s news from the dailies. But it is with great hardship that he is able to get two villagers to listen to him. You can very well understand from this whata stupendous task it must be to carry good literature to their door. It is the aim of the Parishad to remove that defect. I am not mad after any particular script, but I want you to take a considered and dispassionate view of the question. I appeal to you to give this Parishad as much assistance as you can.libtech_114_footnote
 Kakasaheb has told you the kind of literature to which we have limited ourselves. I am not fond of literature for its own sake, I do not make a fetish of literacy either. Literacy must be one of the many means for intellectual development, but we have had in the past intellectual giants who were unlettered. That is why we have confined ourselves only to literature of the cleanest and healthiest kind. How can we have this, unless we have your hearty co-operation and unless you are prepared to select suitable literature in your respective languages?

90,,LONG LIVE KHADI,"
    
Shri Kakubhai writes to say from Bombay:libtech_115_footnote
 This increase may be regarded as fairly satisfactory. There is no reason to be pleased at the daily sale of khadi worth Rs. 1,000 in the biggest khadi bhandar in the country, and that too, in a city like Bombay. For me the sale of khadi is the best thermometer for measuring India’s peaceful progress. The reader should also bear in mind that this Rs. 1,000 includes orders which have been received from outside also. How many shops are there in Bombay which sell mill-cloth both foreign and Indian? What is their daily sale? And how many khadi shops are there? We shall have to hang our heads in shame if these figures are compared. Despite this, we can derive satisfaction from the fact that khadi worth Rs. 1,000 is being sold and, this time, an increase in sale has been recorded.
 Shri Kakubhai cannot give any reason for the increase in sale. I found from my conversation with Shri Vithaldas Jerajani that this sale was in no way connected with the enthusiasm about the Legislative Assembly. Had it been the case, the increase would have amounted to not one, but many thousands. Hence, there is some other  reason behind it. I presume that people have increasingly begun  to understand the significance of khadi, and those who wear khadi are satisfied by the higher rate paid to women spinners and thus their enthusiasm for wearing it has increased. If my guess is correct, it is something that should encourage khadi workers. I have found out something of practical significance. The softness and durability of khadi have increased to a considerable extent ever since the rate for spinning has been increased and the work of women spinners is being supervised. The reason for this is obvious. And that too is something that should encourage us. If readers of Harijanbandhu can throw some light on this, they should write to me.

 [March 28, 1937]libtech_117_footnote
 If the Congress went on as usual while we passed resolutions in support of Hindi as the common language, our work would be  painfully slow. This resolution appeals to the Congress to exclude the use of English as a language of inter-provincial communication. English, it says, should not be allowed to take either the place of the provincial languages or of Hindi. If English had not ousted the languages of the people, the provincial languages would have been wonderfully rich today. If England had adopted French as the language of her national deliberations we should have had no English literature today. French was the language there after the Norman conquest. But then the tide turned in favour of ‘English-undefiled’. That created the great English literature we know. What Yakub  Hussain Saheb said was quite right. The Mussalman contact had a great influence on our culture and civilization, so much so that there were men like the late Pandit Ajodhyanath who were perfect scholars in Persian and Arabic. If they had given to their mother tongue all the time that they gave to the study of Arabic and Persian, the mother tongue would have made great progress. Then English came  to  occupy the unnatural position it does until this day. University professors can wax eloquent in English but will not be able to express their thoughts in their own mother tongue. Sir C. V. Raman’s researches are all contained in his papers in English. They are a sealed book to those who do not know English. But look at the position in
 
 
 
 
 
 Russia. Even before the Revolution they resolved to have all their textbooks (including scientific) in Russian. That really prepared the way for Lenin’s Revolution. We cannot establish real mass contacts until the Congress decides to have all its deliberations in Hindi and of its provincial organizations in the pvovincial languages.
 The resolution becomes as much a business of the Bharatiya Parishad as of the Sammelan, for the Bharatiya Parishad is intended to advance the cause of the provincial languages, and if the Congress does not adopt the resolution its object will be to that extent frustrated.
 It is not that I am making a fetish of language. It is not that I would refuse to have swaraj if I could have it at the cost of our language, as indeed I should refuse to have it at the cost of Truth and Non-violence. But I insist so much on the language because it is a powerful means of achieving national unity, and the more firmly it is established the broader based will be our unity.
 Don’t be alarmed at my proposal of everyone learning Hindi plus a language of other provinces, besides his mother tongue. Languages are easily learnt. Max Muller knew 14 languages; and I know a German girl who knew 11 languages when she came here five years ago and now knows two or three Indian languages. But you have created before your mind’s eye a bugbear and somehow feel that you cannot express yourselves in Hindi. It is our mental laziness that we have made no progress in spite of Hindustani being adopted in our Congress constitution these 12 years.
 Yakub Hussain Saheb asked me why I insisted so much on ‘Hindi-Hindustani’ and was not content with having simple ‘Hind- ustani’ as the common language. I must take you through the genesis of the whole thing. It was as early as 1918 that as President of the Hindi    Sahitya Sammelan  I suggestedlibtech_118_footnoteto the Hindi-speaking world to broaden their definition of Hindi to include Urdu. When I presided over the Sammelan once again in 1935libtech_119_footnoteI   had   the   word Hindi properly defined as a language that was spoken both by Hindus and Mussalmans and written in Devnagari or Urdu script. My object
 
 
 
 in doing so was to include in Hindi the high-flown Urdu of Maulana Shibli and the high-flown Hindi of Pandit Shyamsunderdas. Then came the Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad, also an off-shoot of the Sammelan. At my suggestion the name Hindi-Hindustani was adopted in the place of Hindi. Abdul Huq Saheb stoutly opposed me there. I could not accept his suggestion. I should have done  violence  to myself and to the Sammelan if I had given up the word ‘Hindi’ which was the word of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and which I had persuaded them to define so as to include Urdu. We must remember that the word Hindi is not of Hindu coinage, it was coined after the Muslim advent to describe the language which Hindus of the North spoke and studied. So many Mussalman writers of note  have described their language as Hindi. And why now this quarrel over words when Hindi is defined to include the variations spoken and written by Hindus and Mussalmans?
 Than there is another factor to be considered. So far as South Indian languages are concerned it is only Hindi with a large number of Sanskrit words that can appeal to them, for they  are  already familiar with a certain number of Sanskrit words and the Sanskrit sound. When the two—Hindi and Hindustani or Urdu—amalgamate and really become the all-India language, daily augmented by the introduction of provincial words, we shall have a vocabulary richer even than the English vocabulary. I hope you now understand why I insist on Hindi-Hindustani.
 And then I would give a tip to such of you as dread the advent of Hindi-Hindustani as the only language of the Congress. Invest in a Hindi daily or a good book, read aloud part of it regularly even for five minutes, select passages from well-known Hindi writings andspeeches and repeat them to yourselves, for correct intonation, make a point of learning a few Hindi words every day, and I assure you that such regular practice will be enough to enable you to express yourselves well in Hindi-Hindustani in six months’ time and without putting an undue strain on your memory.

HINDU”libtech_120_footnote","
    
 MADRAS,
 March  28, 1937
 Representative: As  the  reputed co-author of the resolutionlibtech_121_footnoteof the A. I. C. C. on office-acceptance, can you throw some light on the position as it has emerged today?
 GANDHIJI: It is definite that I am not saying anything about politics. That must be understood.
 R. Are you aware that an opinion has been expressed that each side has but tried to put the other in the wrong and that that opinion seems to be held by responsible public men?
 G. I do not know about it. I have not yet seen this evening’s papers.
 The interviewer had to switch on to other topics and he sought Gandhiji’s views on the progress of Hindi in South India with particular   reference   to   the   resolutionlibtech_122_footnoteadopted   by   the   All-India Sahitya Sammelan that day urging the exclusive use of Hindi in Congress deliberations.
 G. The progress made in the matter of Hindi is comparatively speaking good. Whereas some years back there was hardly anybody who knew Hindi, today there is a big establishment looking after the training in Hindi of several thousands of boys and girls and men and women. That is a sign of progress. But I cannot say I am satisfied with the response from all the four Provinces of the South so far as the leaders of public opinion are concerned. I very much fear they have not taken up the study of Hindi seriously so as to be able to carry on conversation in Hindi or to understand what is going on in the Hindi Press or to be able to speak to the multitude in northern Provinces. It is therefore a happy thing that for the first time in the history of a southern Province, the Hindi Sammelan was invited and had its sittings in Madras.
 I hope and believe the prejudice that Hindi was intended to supplant the provincial languages has by this time been set at rest. Indeed the effort of the Sammelan is to strengthen the provincial
 
 
 languages also. If the provincial languages are not strong, Hindi as a language of inter-provincial intercourse would not be able to thrive. Love of Hindi as the rashtrabhasha must go hand in hand with love of provincial languages.
 It was indeed a great thing that with unanimous consent, this resolution asking the Working Committee of the Congress to stop the use of English in all-India proceedings has been passed. I have no doubt that English has enjoyed a status and importance in public affairs which it should never have enjoyed. He who runs can see that this usurpation by English of the place that belongs to Hindi or Hindustani has to that extent delayed the progress of Hindi and also of the vernaculars. It is not a very flattering admission on our part that the riches and discoveries of physical sciences cannot be accurately described in the provincial languages or in Hindi. I am convinced that it is sheer laziness on our part which makes us say so. These two conferences, the Sammelan and the Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad, will have rendered a useful service if the eyes of leaders of opinion in the South are opened to this obvious fact.
 R. If, as you say, the fear that the spread of Hindi may be prejudicial to the growth of provincial languages is dying down, is not the suggestion for the adoption of a common script for all Indian languages likely to be a disturbing factor?
 G. That is a question very well put. It should be most unfortunate if the suggestion that we should have a common script for the provincial languages disturbs in any way the provincial mind that it is an attempt directly or indirectly to undermine the importance of provincial languages. I can say without fear of contradiction that nothing was farther from my thoughts than that by the adoption of a common script the chances of provincial languages  should  be reduced. On the other hand, a common script would remove a great difficulty from the path of persons wanting to learn languages of India other than their own and would thereby facilitate the study of those languages. My observation was based on personal experience and that of the experience of co-workers.
 We are an illiterate nation, illiterate in the sense that hardly seven per cent of the people of India can trace their own alphabet. What are you going to do to the other ninety or ninety-three per cent? Should the seven or ten per cent of literates, because they are associated with  a particular form of script and because they have associated the provincial sound with those signs, impose those signs on the ninety or
 ninetythree per cent and make it difficult for them to learn other provincial languages? A little care for the illiterate masses and a little thought about all India should convince the seven per cent of provincial literates of the necessity of adopting a common script. Has the adoption of a common script in Europe prevented the growth of different European languages in any shape or form?
 Conversation then turned on the rural uplift work which was being carried on in Segaon village and Gandhiji sat up and said:
 You can talk to me freely of it. You can talk to me of khadi, the Charkha, basket-making and paper-making.
 R. Had paper-making made great progress in your Segaon reconstruction scheme?
 G. If I get a contract for paper from newspapers, I hope to be able to supply their requirements, though I am  not  just  now competing with the paper mills. For, were I to enter into that competition just now, I must needs neglect the anti-malaria work.
 Speaking of malaria, Gandhiji said that preventive measures and diet were the most important items in anti-malaria work. Administration of quinine, he said, was of no avail unless food was given to the people at the same time. Gandhiji added:
I have got to give them milk or buttermilk in all cases without
 exception and advise the adoption of a diet which would enable them to survive the disease. I am convinced that diet is more important than drugs and good food better than constant drugging.
 An interesting piece of information which Gandhiji gave out  in  this connection was that he had hardly taken drugs except on two occasions.
 R. Would you suggest a six-month plan for Congress members of the Legislatures on these lines of rural work as the Legislatures, apparently, will have a holiday for the period?
G. Jawaharlal can prescribe one.
 Gandhiji then answered a few questions about khadi. At first, he said, he was inclined to think that enthusiasm for it had abated. But the monthly increases in the sales of khadi made him hesitate to pronounce any opinion that love of khadi had abated. It was certainly true, he said, that whereas formerly “a forest of khadi caps” was visible, one did not see such demonstrations now. That, however, was no test of the real love of khadi. Gandhiji added:
 I do notice this happy result of the increase in the wages of spinners that it has not affected the demand for khadi,  as  some workers feared it might affect and I should be surprised if, at a date not very distant, we do not adopt a further rise in the spinners’ wages.
 Whilst therefore Gandhiji had absolutely no sense of despair  about  the progress of khadi, he could not, he said, conceal from himself or from the Press and the public his desire for much greater progress than what made so far. Conceived as a supplementary occupation for the millions of underfed villagers of India, Gandhiji said:
 Khadi should command the sympathy and support of town- dwellers and others who required a certain amount of clothing for covering themselves.

93,"March 30, 1937",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
    
 MADRAS,
 March 30, 1937
 Having brooded over the refusal of the Governors to give the assurances asked for by invited Congress leaders in the Majority Provinces, I feel that I must give my opinion on the situation that has arisen in the country. I have had three cables from London shown to me asking for my opinion. Friends in Madras too have pressed for its publication. Though it is departure from my self-imposed rule, I can no longer withstand the pressure especially as I am the sole author of the  office-acceptance   clause   of   the   Congress   resolutionlibtech_123_footnoteand   the originator of the idea of attaching a condition to office-acceptance.
 My desire was not to lay down any impossible condition. On the contrary, I wanted to devise a condition that could be easily accepted by the Governors. There was no intention whatsoever to lay down a condition whose acceptance would mean any the slightest abrogation of the Constitution. Congressmen were well aware that they could not and would not ask for any such amendment. The Congress policy was and is not to secure an amendment, but an absolute ending of the Constitution which nobody likes. Congressmen were and are  also aware that they could not end it by mere acceptance of office, even conditional. The object of that section of the Congress which believed in office-acceptance was, pending the creation, by means consistent with the Congress creed of non-violence, of a situation that would transfer all power to the people, to work the offices so as to strengthen the Congress which has been shown predominantly to represent mass opinion. I felt that this object could not be secured unless there was a gentlemanly understanding between the Governors and their Congress Ministers that they would not exercise their special powers of
 
 interference so long as the Ministers acted within the Constitution. Not to do so would be to court an almost immediate deadlock  after  entering upon office. I felt that honesty demanded that under- standing.
 It is common cause that the Governors have discretionary powers. Surely there was nothing extra-constitutional in their saying that they would not exercise their discretion against Ministers carrying on constitutional activities. It may be remembered that the understanding was not to touch the numerous other safeguards over which the Governors had no power. A strong party with the decisive backing of the electorate could not be expected to put itself in the precarious position of being in dread of interference at the will of the Governors. The question may be put in another way. Should the Governors be courteous to the Ministers or discourteous? I hold that it would be distinctly discourteous if they interfered with their Ministers in matters over which law gave the latter full control and with which the Governors were under no legal obligation to interfere. A self- respecting Minister conscious of an absolute majority at his back  could not but demand the assurance of non-interference. Have I not heard Sir Samuel Hoarelibtech_124_footnotelibtech_125_footnoteand other Ministers saying in so many words that ordinarily the Governors would not use their admittedly large powers of interference? I claim that the Congress formula has asked for nothing more.
 It has been claimed on behalf of the British Government that the Act gives autonomy to the Provinces. If that is so, it is not the Governors but the Ministers who are during their period of office responsible for the wise adminstration of their Provinces. Responsible Ministers sensible of their duty could not submit to interference in the pursuance of their daily duty. It does therefore appear to me that once more the British Government has broken to the heart what it has promised to the ear. I doubt not that they can and will impose their will on the people till the latter develop enough strength from within to resist it, but that cannot be called working provincial autonomy.
 By flouting the majority obtained through the machinery of their creation, they have in plain language ended the autonomy which they claim the Constitution has given to the Provinces. The rule
 
 therefore will now be the rule of the sword, not of the pen, nor of the indisputable majority. Anyway that is the only interpretation which with all the goodwill in the world, I can put upon Government action. For I believe in the cent per cent honesty of my formula whose acceptance might have prevented a crisis and resulted in a natural, orderly and peaceful transference of power from the bureaucracy to the largest and fullest democracy known to the world.

 CHI. BRIJKRISHNA,
 I got your letter yesterday on my return from Madras. It is unworthy of you to hold that I discourage you from joining me because of your faults: moreover, it is unjust to me. I have forbidden you from coming simply because I think living with me would be an idle waste of time. But if you have no peace otherwise, you may certainly come here and stay as long as you deem it fit. What would happen if your health suffered? Even this point may be overlooked for the time being. This much then for your living with me.
 Now for your predicament. I think you should get married. There is no grave error attached to marrying; every widower does it, which is certainly better than continually harbouring lustful thoughts.
 It is difficult to pronounce any opinion on wealth. I would only say this much that even the earning of wealth can be a mode of service, and in that too some ethical restraints must be observed and the prescribed rule should be applied to money-making and  the wealth should be as far as possible used for the benefit of society.
 Your anguish increases as you try to work beyond your strength. Ethics should not be misinterpreted in any way. The rest on meeting you. Your letter is being returned."

Give her hip-baths. I had a letter from Kanti. He is to go    
 to Mysore. For the time being he will be in Rajkot. He will go to Mysore at the end of April. Possibly he might go to Trivandrum for a few days. Devdas has permitted him. Manu’s marriage will take place in Segaon and Kanti is bound to come there then. I leave here on the 14th instant returning on the 25th. You may come over whenever it suits you. I am very glad to learn that you are keeping well. When you are perfectly fit I shall be able to extract work from you to my heart’s content. I returned yesterday from Madras. There was a lot of work there this time.

103,,HINDI PRACHAR AND PURITY,"
  	What is this! I do not in the least insist on keeping Malkani. If 	his leaving brings greater benefit to the Harijan Niwas it is our 	duty promptly to remove him from there. Hence whatever is good may 	be done.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	Hindi: C.W. 8030. Courtesy: G.D. Birla         	On the 26th ultimo there was the convocation of the Hindi Prachar 	University for giving certificates to those young men and women who 	had passed its final examination. I was invitedlibtech_139_footnotelibtech_140_footnoteto 	present the certificates to the graduates. They had to take a 	threefold vow which pledged them to the spread of Hindi-Hindustani, 	service of the motherland and personal purity for the good name of 	the University.  I drew the special attention of the graduates to 	the last two parts of the pledge. The authors of the pledge, 	however, had a special intention in inserting the clauses about 	service and personal purity. They were evidently of opinion that if 	the young men and women who passed through the institution spread 	Hindi in the spirit of service, and if their personal purity was 	assured, these two factors would enhance the prestige of the 	graduates and they would themselves be the best advertising media 	for popularizing Hindi-Hindustani. I therefore reminded them of the 	pledge that they had just taken. In order to enforce my argument, I 	quoted to the graduates the instance of the reported fall of a Hindi 	teacher who had already damaged the cause of Hindi prachar. When I 	referred to this report I had little thought of what was in store 	for me.  	For the morning following I had a letter placed in my hands giving 	detailed information of the fall from purity of Pandit Harihar    
 Sharma,libtech_141_footnotethe prime author of the pledge   and  the  Secretary  of  the Sabha. He is also a member of the Satyagraha Ashram from its foundation. He and his wife qualified themselves for Hindi prachar work. He has been for years the soul of the Hindi movement in the South. At the Ashram he was held in high esteem. He was easily among those who were always regarded above suspicion, above reproach. I could not therefore believe the letter. I spoke to him the next morning; and though he resisted the imputation for a while, the concealment became too unbearable for him and he confessed everything. According to the Ashram code he gave me permission to refer to the sin in public. I at once broke the news to the executive. They were unprepared for the stunning news. Pandit Sharma tendered resignation on the ground of the fall. The executive will have accepted the resignation and the administration will have been overhauled. Kakasaheb stayed in Madras to advise the executive of the Hindi Prachar Sabha.
 But for me the matter does not end there. It may be thought that events like this do not need publicity. Those who think so evidently do not know the full facts. The institution with which I am intimately connected have to deal with masses of mankind, both men  and women. They work through hundreds of volunteers. These have no authority but the moral. The volunteer workers inspire confidence because purity of personal life is assumed about them. Their influence will wane immediately they lose credit for purity. Publicity has never harmed the institutions or the persons involved in sin.
 It behoves the workers throughout India to learn the lesson from Pandit Sharma’s fall that they must be ever watchful of themselves and not be found napping and unready to resist when the enemy assails them. This remark applies perhaps with greater force to Hindi teachers in the South than to others. There is no purdah there. Girls there have been found to be more interested in Hindi than boys. Teachers by reason of their very occupation exercise over their pupils a moral authority which disarms suspicion and creates a confidence which would ordinarily be wanting.
 Indeed a suggestion has already been made to the effect that in order to be fool-proof the Hindi Prachar Sabha should stop private
 
 tuition of girls altogether. I have not been able to subscribe to the view. Lapses will take place no matter how careful one is. There cannot, therefore, be overcarefulness. But to stop private tuition of girls is to admit moral bankruptcy. There is no warrant for panic. So far as I know, the Hindi teachers in general have done their work without blemish in the matter of personal purity. I  have  not suppressed from the public any proved lapses. We may not invite temptations nor may we shut ourselves in iron cages in order to avoid them altogether. We must be prepared to face them when they come uninvited. Sharma fell because he invited temptation. He trusted himself too much.
 Let the public that is interested in Hindi prachar work not be curious about the future of Pandit Sharma or about the details of his error. He will be with me whilst he is reforming himself. His disappearance from the organization does not mean the close of a career of service. Indeed if this fall has taught him the lesson of his life, he will have lost nothing nor Hindi prachar a worker of his calibre. To err is human, to own up one’s error and to so act as to be proof against it is manly. Let us hope that he has the manly quality necessary for the task and pray that he may become a better servant for the fall. Some of the saints of the world had been  notorious sinners.

 "
104,,AN UNFORTUNATE DOCUMENT,"
    
 Fourteen highly educated Indian Christians occupying impor- tant social positions have issued a joint manifesto setting forth their views on the missionary work among Harijans. The document has been published in the Indian Press. I was disinclined to publish it in Harijan, as after having read it more than once I could not bring myself to say anything in its favour and I felt that a critical review of it might serve no useful purpose. But I understand that my criticism is expected and will be welcomed no matter how candid and strong it may be.
 The reader will find the manifesto published in full in this issue. The headinglibtech_142_footnotelibtech_143_footnoteis also the authors’.They seem to have fallen between
 
 K. K. Chandy, S. Gnanaprakasam, S. Gurubatham, S. Jesudasen, M. P. Job, G. V. Job,
 G. Joseph, K. I. Matthai, A. A. Paul, S. E. Ranganadham, A. N. Sudarsanam, O. F. E. Zacharia, D. M. Devasahayam, G. V. Martyn.
 two stools in their attempt to sit on both. They have tried to reconcile the irreconcilable. If one section of Christians has been aggressively open and militant, the other represented by the authors of  the manifesto is courteously patronizing. They would not be aggressive for the sake of expedience. The purpose of the manifesto is not to condemn unequivocally the method of converting the illiterate and the ignorant but to assert the right of preaching the Gospel to the millions of Harijans. The key to the manifesto is contained in paragraphs 7 and 8. This is what one reads in paragraph 7:
 Men and women individually and in family or village groups will continue to seek the fellowship of the Christian Chruch. That is the real movement of the Spirit of God. And no power on earth can stem that tide. It will be the duty of the Christian Church in India to receive such seekers after the truth as it is in Jesus Christ and provide for them instruction and spiritual nurture. The Church will cling to its right to receive such people into itself from whatever religious group they may come. It will cling to the further right to go about in these days of irreligion and materialism to awaken spiritual hunger in all.
 These few sentences are striking instance of how the wish becomes father to the thought. It is an unconscious process but not on that account less open to criticism. Men and women do not seek the fellowship of the Christian Church. Poor Harijans are no better than the others. I wish they had real spiritual hunger. Such as it is, they satisfy by visits to the temples, however crude they may be. When the missionary of another religion goes to them, he goes like any vendor of goods. He has no special spiritual merit that will distinguish him from those to whom he goes. He does, however,  possess  material goods which he promises to those who will come to his fold. Then mark, the duty of the Christian Church in India turns into a right. Now when duty-becomes a right it ceases to be a duty. Performance of a duty requires one quality–that of suffering and  introspection. Exercise of a right requires a quality that gives the power to impose one’s will upon the resister through sanctions devised by the claimant or the law whose aid he invokes in the exercise of his right. I have the duty of paying my debt, but I have no right to thrust  the  owed  coppers (say) into the pocket of an unwilling creditor. The duty of taking spiritual message is performed by the messenger becoming a fit vehicle by prayer and fasting. Conceived as a right, it may easily become an imposition on unwilling parties.
 Thus the manifesto, undoubtedly designed to allay suspicion and soothe the ruffled feelings of Hindus, in my opinion, fails to accomplish its purpose. On the contrary, it leaves a bad taste in the
 mouth. I venture to suggest to the authors that they need to  re-  examine their position in the light of my remarks. Let them recognize the fundamental difference between rights and duties. In the spiritual sphere, there is no such thing as a right.

105,,OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF A GOSEVAK,"
    
The secretary of a goshala writes:libtech_144_footnote
 It is my firm belief that by making good use of the hide of a dead animal religion is not violated, nor should sanatanist Hindus feel offended over this. Yes, it is certainly a lapse of religion if full use of the hide of a dead animal is not made because it increases cow- slaughter. The price of a cow decreases day by day and so cows are easily sold and taken straight to slaughter-houses. If we  consider goseva as an inseparable part of Hindu religion, we can neither look down upon the tanners’ profession nor consider them untouchable. The cow dies solely from our ignorance. Dharma cannot be protected by merely talking about it; that can be done only by understanding the meaning of the Shastras and by practising it. I have written several times that if the goshalas in India know their duty and adhere to it faithfully, then cow-slaughter can be done away with and cow’s milk will be easily available to everyone. There is no exaggeration of any kind in this statement. Almost all cows are owned by Hindus. If they adhere to their dharma and refrain from selling cows which is the cause of cow-slaughter, there can be no cow-slaughter. Let every goshala become an ideal dairy, that is, self-reliant, and let experts on dairying and animal husbandry work in it. A self reliant goshala must prosper from day to day. It can also make proper use of the hides of the dead cattle. This amounts to saying that with the increase in cattle wealth, our knowledge will also grow; and this will be a great help to us in reducing unemployment in the country. Even if one goshala will accomplish this task, other goshalas will follow it.

But I   can  understand  the delicacy. Satyavati deserves the place apart from her fanaticism which makes her sometimes a dangerous ally. You may show my objection to Kamaladevi if you know her sufficiently. For I do not say this behind her back. I believe she knows my opinion. It hurts me to hold that opinion, but how can I help myself?
 There fore let not my opinion weigh with you unduly. If those whom you want do not object, you should have her. Of course I am partial to Mridula. But Satyavati has a longer record of service and has from a public point of view a better right. Mridula is a brick so far as work and loyalty are concerned. She will be the youngest member, if the choice falls on her. If I had to make the selection of course the choice will be Satyavati almost for the reasons that make you exclude Sarup.

 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 Why should you become ill? Having become ill, why will you not give yourself rest? I thought you were going to steal away somewhere after Indu came. Please give my love to her when she arrives. I must send her a line with this.
 Now about your grouse. Somehow or other everything I say and even perhaps do jars on you. Silence was impossible. I thought in the context the words courtesy and discourtesy came out all right. Yours is the first note of complaint from the Congress side about the statementlibtech_161_footnotelibtech_162_footnote. I could not help myself if the complaint was universal. I am glad you have written. You must bear with me till my understanding becomes clear or your fears are dispelled. I apprehend no harm from my statement. Is there anything at the back of your mind that I do not understand?
 Kamaladevi travelled with us from Wardha to Madras. She was coming from Delhi. She came to my compartment twice and had long chats.  At last she wanted to know why Sarojini Devi was excludedlibtech_163_footnotelibtech_164_footnote, why Laxmipati was being kept away by Rajaji, why Anasuyabai was excluded, and so on. I then told her of my part in her exclusion, and told her almost all that [I] could remember of the note I wrote for you on that silent Monday. Of course, I told her I had no  hand  in Sarojini’s exclusion at first or inclusion after. I told her also that Rajaji, so far as I knew, had nothing to do with L’s exclusion. I thought you should know this.
 I hope this will find you fully restored. You don’t say anything about Mother.

         CHI. 	PRABHA,         April 	5, 1937 
  	What a disappointing letter? What is wrong with you? Why should you 	be unhappy. Why need you worry? How can one have one’s way in 	everything? Dharma requires us to go on doing cheerfully whatever 	service we get an opportunity of doing without seeking it. What then 	will be happiness and misery? Is there anything in this world which 	can be done with any security? When life itself is short and 	extremely uncertain, what can we say of our activities? Only dharma 	abides; it is imperishable because it is related to the atman. And 	dharma lies in truth and ahimsa. Whatever we do while following it 	is proper. And what if, in doing it, we get daily something new to 	do or have to wander from place to place every day? What difference 	does it make whether we have a broom in our hand or a pen? We should 	be content with whatever comes to us unsought. We should bring 	credit to whatever work we do. Stay there as long as Father desires. 	Go to Sitab Diyara if you think it necessary  and  to Ahmedabad when 	Jayaprakash permits you to do so.  Who  would force you to stay on 	if you did not feel happy there?  	I have written to Poona regarding Harijan. Vasumati arrived 	yesterday. She will stay for some time. Amtul is at Rajpura. Khan 	Saheb has come. Bal will come the day after tomorrow. Manu will be 
 married at Belgaum. I have to reach Belgaum on the 15th or the 16th. [Address:] Hudli, Belgaum District.

  	I got your letter. I am replying to you at the Rajkot address. 	Paparamma was not in a position to go to Belgaum. Ramchandran is 	quite ill. He had an attack of pleurisy. He is better now but is 	taking rest. His nerves also have become weak. He did not permit 	Saraswati to come because he is still afraid that her studies may be 	disturbed.  	It is surprising that your thumb is still not cured. Did you try mud 	treatment? If the thumb is bandaged while writing, you will find     
 it much easier to write. I myself had tried a mud bandage as help in writing with the tired thumb, and I had been able to continue working.
 Manu has spared you and so it will not be necessary for you to come to Belgaum just for the sake of the wedding. But you probably know that Ba herself is coming there. If, therefore, your stay there for  a few days is likely to satisfy your aunts, you can come to Belgaum. And from there you can go to Mysore. If it can be arranged this way, you can be present at the wedding and, after the function at Belgaum is over, you can go to Mysore.
 Devdas’s letter is all right. I do not remember to have used the word ‘strong’, though I cannot say, either, that I didn’t use it. Even if  I did, what is the harm? Even if your desire is no more than a simple wish, there is no harm in satisfying it. Going to Mysore should depend on your own will. It should be enough if Devdas gives his consent. If you do not wish, why should you go? I am firm in my view. I personally prefer Mysore to Bombay, both from the point of view of the climate and of peace of mind. I do not know whether education there will be of the standard of Wilson College. But according to me that depends more on the student. I have come across many dullards educated in Wilson College and very intelligent Mysoreans who have never gone out of Mysore. But the best course is that you should go to Mysore and see things for yourself and then decide as you like.

 CHU. BHUJANGILAL,
 I have your letter and also the copy of your letter to Chandulalbhai. You are very ambitious. If you wish to be successfulyou must improve your handwriting. One who makes an effort and is careful even about very small matters will remain so about bigger things also. But the belief that one who is careless about little things can be careful about bigger things is a fallacy.
 You are a worshipper of non-violence. Politeness is an integral part of non-violence because impoliteness causes pain, politeness does not. A boy who addresses his mother as his father’s wife is telling the truth but as his language is rude it is violent and is frowned upon in good society.
 If you really approve of my way of working, you should be well versed in the science of khadi. You should know what is goseva and put it into practice and daily serve the so-called untouchables. If you do these and such other things in which I am engaged, you will clearly see your path.

 Tell me, do you read and understand Japjilibtech_173_footnotein the original? If so I would like you to translate literally one verse every day. I am using both the translations you left for me. None satisfies my taste. This work ought not to take you more than five minutes daily, i.e., if you know Japji throughly. If you do not, you need not trouble yourself about it.
 What you tell me about the Tanning Institute is interesting. If they have a prospectus, send it on to me.
 It is decided that we leave on 14th for Belgaum. The station is Suldhal.

137,,WONDERFUL IF TRUE,"
    
 During our morning and evening walks, Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan and I often talk on matters of common interest. Having travelled in the Frontier territories as far as Kabul and beyond and knowing the Frontier tribes well, he often describes to me the habits and customs of these simple folk. He tells me that these tribesmen who are untouched by the so-called civilization live principally on maize and barley, bread and lentils supplemented at times by buttermilk. They get meat but rarely. The only way I could account for their well- known hardiness was their open-air life and  invigorating  climate. Khan Saheb promptly added:
 That is not enough. The secret of their strength lies in their chaste lives. They marry, both men and women, after full maturity. Unfaithfulness, adultery or unmarried love are practically unknown. Union out of wedlock is punishable by death. The injured party has the right to take the life of the wrongdoer.
 If this chastity is so universal as Khan Saheb describes it, it furnishes us in India a lesson that we should take to heart. I suggested to Khan Saheb that if the fine physique of the tribesmen was largely due to their continence, there must be perfect co-operation between the mind and the body. For, if the mind hankered after satisfaction of the flesh and the body resisted, there must be tremendous waste of vital energy, leaving the body thoroughly exhausted. Khan Saheb agreed that that was a fair deduction and that, so far as he was able to judge, he felt that the tribesmen were so habituated to continence outside marriage that young men and women never seemed to desire sexual satisfaction outside marriage. Khan Saheb also told me that the women in the tribal areas never observed the purdah, there was no false prudery there, the women were fearless, roamed about anywhere freely, were well able to take care of themselves and defend their honour without seeking or needing male protection.
 Khan Saheb, however, admits that this continence not being based on reason or enlightened faith breaks down when these men and women of the hills come in contact with civilized or soft life where departure from the custom carries no punishment and publicopinion looks upon unfaithfulness and adultery with more or less indifference. This opens up reflections which I must not discuss just now. My purpose in writing this just now is to seek corroboration and further light from those who know these tribesmen, as  Khan Saheb does, and to suggest to young men and women of the plains that observance of continence, if it is really natural to the tribesmen, as Khan Saheb thinks it is, should be equally natural to us, if only we
 would inhabit our thought world with the right kind of thoughts and deal summarily with the intruders. Indeed, if the right kind settle down in sufficiently large numbers, the intruders will be crowded out no doubt. The process requires courage. But self-restraint never accrues to the faint-hearted. It is the beautiful fruit of watchfulness and ceaseless effort in the form of prayer and fasting. The prayer is not vain repetition nor fasting mere starvation of the body. Prayer has to come from the heart which knows God by faith, and fasting is abstinence from evil or injurious thought, activity or food. Starvation of the body when the mind thinks of a multiplicity of dishes is worse than useless.

 "
138,,KHADI IN SWADESHI EXHIBITIONS,"
    
 In all other parts of India where swadeshi exhibitions permitting mill-cloth are held the A. I. S. A. has as a rule refused to exhibit khadi. And the rule has answered the purpose for which it was framed. From U.P., however, the pressure has come to relax the rule. But I have hitherto resisted the temptation. U.P. khadi workers made a special reference for their guidance. They are almost all Congressmen no less ardent than the others, but they have dedicated themselves to the Congress service through its constructive and the most difficult programme, khadi. Appreciating their difficulty I referred  the question to Shri Jawaharlal Nehru for his opinion. I have received the following replylibtech_182_footnotelibtech_183_footnotefrom him:
 I have your letter of the 5th March enquiring about khadi at exhibitions. This matter has been repeatedly discussed by us in the course of the past year ever since my return from Europe. . . .
 The question you have put is not easy to answer. The average khadi worker seems to be of opinion that khadi should not be exhibited if mill-cloth is allowed there. Other Congress workers are usually of a contrary opinion on the ground that at such exhibitions there is usually a good sale of khadi. Obviously the opinion of the khadi worker, who is presumed to be an expert at his job and who is anxious to push khadi, should be almost final. I would therefore hesitate to give my decision against him unless I succeed in convincing him. I imagine that from a certain long-distance view it is better even to incur some loss now so as to avoid producing any confusion in the public mind as to what khadi is and what it is not. This can only be done by
 
 adherence to the present policy of banning certified khadi sales in such exhibitions.
 At the same time, I find that uncertified khadi is sold at such exhibitions and plenty of people patronize it. There are quite large numbers of people as you know who are not particularly keen on buying certified khadi, but who are prepared to do so if it comes their way. The point is: are we to cater for the people in any especial measure, or are we to concentrate on holding fast to those who desire to use pure khadi only? This question has not only its business side but its psychological side. Khadi has on the one hand built up a firm foundation for itself, and there is a body of men in the country who must have pure khadi whatever the cost or the trouble. At the same time khadi does not spread as rapidly as it might among other classes who only occasionally patronize it. For khadi workers the object should be to develop the khadi habit in the latter. That habit comes largely from appeals, to the mind or heart and partly from sheer habit. Ordinarily speaking, it would be a good thing to have as many casual purchasers as possible so that they may get used to buying and wearing khadi and thus develop the real habit. The present policy to some extent keeps away this casual purchaser and thus reduces the field from which regular khadi buyers might be drawn. . . .
 Therefore, if you want my final opinion, I cannot give it very definitely,
 and because of my not being definite I must respect the opinions of others who are working for khadi. I am, however, inclined to think that it might be preferable to allow khadi to be exhibited and sold in these exhibitions under certain conditions which would prevent as far as possible (1) something else being mistaken for khadi and the distinction between khadi and mill-cloth being clearly preserved (2) the exclusion of partly foreign stuffs from the exhibition.
In the absence of final opinion which he is unable to give, he
 would respect the opinions of others who are working for khadi. He is, however, “inclined to think that it might be preferable to allow khadi to be exhibited and sold in these exhibitions.” My own experience, however, tells me that it is dangerous to befog the mass mind by putting khadi in juxtaposition with the gaudy mill-made cloth. It is very like putting human beings side by side with robots. Human beings may be worsted in the competition if they allow themselves to be compared to robots. Even so will khadi fare, in comparision with mill-made cloth. The planes of the two are different. The aims are opposite. Khadi gives work to all, mill-cloth gives work to some and deprives many of honest labour. Khadi serves the masses, mill-cloth is intended to serve the classes. Khadi serves labour, mill-cloth exploits it. My experience is backed by that of the khadi workers throughout
 India.   I    hope   therefore   that    with   Shri  Jawaharlal   Nehru	the Congressmen of U.P. will respect the experience and the policy of the
 A. I. S. A. in preference to their own opinion, if it be against that of the A. I. S. A.

 WARDHA,
 April 10, 1937
 I have read Lord Lothian’s appeallibtech_184_footnoteto me with the   respect  it deserves. I have a vivid recollection of the talks with him among other friends. The provincial autonomy then pictured was a real stuff unlike what the present Constitution is supposed to give. Lord Zetland’s elaborate  statementlibtech_185_footnoteconfirms  my  view  and   hardens   the   universal suspicion of the British statement’s intentions. So long as they wish to bolster up imperialistic designs, India, which the Congress represents, will never reconcile itself to them. I believe in friendship with Britain, not with imperialistic exploitation.
 I am free to confess ignorance of the Government of India Act and a greater ignorance of the  Select  Committee’s  Report.  My advice to the Congress to adopt my resolution on a conditional acceptance of office was based on an assurance of lawyers amongCongressmen that the Governors could give the required assurance without an infringement of the Act.libtech_186_footnotelibtech_187_footnoteI  do   not,  therefore, need even Sir Samuel Hoare’s past declarations to support me. If, therefore, he disclaims having ever made the statement which I aver having heard him make, I accept his disclaimer without argument. The dismal fact stares India in the face that British statement imposed an Act on India against her declared wishes and then instead of leaving its interpretation to impartial tribunals impose their own upon her and call this transaction autonomy. Lawyers, Mussalman, Parsi and Hindu, whom the Government have hitherto honoured with their partronage, declared that the Governors can without an infringement give the required assurance. I regard the British statesmen’s interpretation as non-judicial, arbitrary and interested.
 
 
 At the same time I recognize that other lawyers give an interpretation favourable to the British Government. Therefore I invite them to appoint an arbitration tribunal of three judges of whom one will be appointed by the Congress, another by the British Government with power to the two to appoint a third to decide whether it is competent for the Governors to give the required assurance described by me. And since the legality of the present Ministries has been questioned, I would refer that question also to the proposed tribunal. There is precedent for such a course. If they would accept my proposal I would advise the Congress to do likewise.
 I mean every word of my previous statementlibtech_188_footnote. I want right to prevail. There is here no question of diplomacy with India. It is a question of life and death. Office will be accepted if only progress towards her goal is accepted, not otherwise. It, therefore, pains me to find Lord Zetland playing upon the old familiar tune of divide and rule. The Congress cannot exist for two days if it disregards the interests of minorities. It cannot bring about mass rule by dividing India into factions. The Congress Ministries, if they ever come into existence, will dig their own graves without the Governors’ safeguards the moment they trample upon the rights of the minorities or resort to injustice otherwise. I regret to have to say it but, to be true, I must say that Lord Zetland’s speech is that of one who is conscious of his sword rather than of his right. His Lordship is again misleading when he says that the Congress wants to be treated as a privileged body. It does not. Anyone representing a most decisive majority like the Congress. would want the gentlemanly assurance that the Congress has asked for.

141,,INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OR DISSIPATION?libtech_190_footnote,"
         	During my recent wanderings in Travancore and  Madras  I found that 	most of the students and ‘intellectuals’ who came into touch 	with me were an instance of intellectual dissipation rather than 	intellectual development. The fault lies in the modern system of 	education which encourages this vicious tendency,  misdirects  the 	mind, and thereby hinders its development instead of helping it. My 	experiments in Segaon have only confirmed this impression. But they 	are as yet too incomplete to be cited as evidence. The views on 	education that I am now going to set forth have been held by me 	right from the time of the founding of the Phoenix settlement in 	South Africa in the year 1904.  	I hold that true education of intellect can only come through a 	proper exercise and training of the bodily organs, e.g., hands, 	feet, eyes, ears, nose, etc. In other words, an intelligent use of 	the bodily organs in a child provides the best and quickest way of 	developing his intellect. But unless the development of the mind and 	body goes hand in hand with a corresponding awakening of the soul, 	the former alone would prove to be a poor lop-sided affair. By 	spiritual training I mean education of the heart. A proper and 	all-round development of the mind, therefore, can take place only 	when it proceeds pari passu with the education of the physical and 	spiritual faculties of the child. They constitute an indivisible 	whole. According to this theory, therefore, it would be a gross 	fallacy to suppose that they can be developed piecemeal or 	independently of one another.    
 The baneful effects of absence of proper co-ordination and harmony among the various faculties of body, mind and soul respectively are obvious. They are all around us; only we have lost perception of them owing to our present perverse associations. Take the case of our village folk. From their childhood upward they toil and labour in their fields from morning till night like their cattle in the midst of whom they live. Their existence is a weary, endless round of mechanical drudgery unrelieved by a spark of intelligence  or  higher graces of life. Deprived of all scope for developing their mind and soul, they have sunk to the level of the beast. Life to them is a sorry bungle which they muddle through anyhow. On the other hand what goes by the name of education in our schools and colleges in the cities today is in reality only intellectual dissipation. Intellectual training is there looked upon as something altogether unrelated to manual or physical work. But since the body must have some sort of physical exercise to keep it in health, they vainly try to attain that end by means of an artificial and otherwise barren system of physical culture which would be ridiculous beyond words if the result was not so tragic. The young man who emerges from this system can in no way compete in physical endurance with an ordinary labourer. The slightest physical exertion gives him headache; a mild exposure to the sun is enough to cause him giddiness. And what is more, all this is looked upon as quite natural. As for the faculties of the heart, they are simply allowed to run to seed or to grow anyhow in a wild undisciplined manner. The result is moral and spiritual anarchy. And it is regarded as something laudable!
 As against this, take the case of a child in whom the education of the heart is attended to from the very beginning. Supposing he is set to some useful occupation like spinning, carpentry, agriculture, etc., for his education and in that connection is given a thorough, comprehensive knowledge relating to the theory of the various operations that he is to perform and the use and construction of the tools that he would be wielding. He would not only develop a fine, healthy body but also a sound, vigorous intellect that is not merely academic but is firmly rooted in and is tested from day-to-day by experience. His intellectual education would include a knowledge of mathematics and the various sciences that are useful for an intelligent
 and efficient exercise of his avocation. If to this is added literature by way of recreation, it would give him a perfect, well-balanced, all-round education in which the intellect, the body and the spirit have all full play and develop together into a natural, harmonious whole. Man is neither mere intellect nor the gross animal body, nor the heart or soul alone. A proper and harmonious combination of all the three is required for the making of the whole man and constitutes the true economics of education. To say that this kind of education can only be given after we have attained our independence would, I am afraid, be like putting the cart before the horse. The advent of independence would be incredibly hastened if we could educate millions of our people through an intelligent exercise of their respective vocations like this and teach them that they live for the common good of all.

142,"April 12, 1937",MESSAGE TO ASSOCIATED PRESS OF AMERICA,"
    
 WARDHA,
 April 12, 1937
 You ask me to give you a special message for the readers of your 1,300 American newspapers, whom you serve. I would like Americans first of all to know my limitations and our internal politics. They should know that I am not even a primary member of the Congress. Whatever influence I possess is purely moral. Congressmen recognize in me the author of purely non-violent action and its technique and, therefore, so long as the Congress retains its creed of truth and non-violence, Congressmen are likely to be guided by my advice whenever it has anything to do, directly or indirectly, with non- violent action, but those who can speak with authority  are  the President of the Congress i.e., Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and the Working Committee, i.e., the Congress Cabinet. I function purely as a humble adviser.
 For me the present issue is not political, but moral, It is a fight between truth and untruth; non-violence and violence and right and
 might; for I hold that Lord Zetland could not have uttered the speechlibtech_191_footnotehe did, unless he was conscious of the might of the sword behind him. It seems as if British statesmen are repenting of even the limited
electorate they have created in India. If they were not, they ought to
 have bowed to the will of the majority as represented by their elected leaders. Surely, it is violence to impose nominated Ministries on the electorate of their creation.
 The crisis is of their own making. It is presumption on their part to interpret Acts of their Parliament. Their jurisprudence has taught us that no man can take the law into his own hands, not even the king. Evidently, the maxim does not apply to the British Ministers. Proof of the pudding is in the eating.
 I have offeredlibtech_192_footnotean honourable way out. Let a judicial tribunal of joint creation give the interpretation. It will be time for them to plead incompetence when the tribunal finds in favour of their interpretation. Till then Congress demand for assurances must be held valid.
 I must repeat that the latest gesture is one of the sword not of goodwill; certainly not of democratic obedience to the will of a democratic majority.

Really useful changes can be made by the patient himself, with the 	help of Kuhne’s and Just’s books. Nature-cure remedies are not 	like ordinary drugs. A patient can say that a particular drug does 	not suit him, but only the vaidya who is treating him can say which 	one is likely to suit. In nature cure, on the other hand, the 	patient himself knows which remedies benefit him and, after he has 	submitted himself to several restrictions, can himself decide as to 	what kind of remedies to employ and in what measures. The reason is 	that the guide can never know as well as the patient can, the 	changes that take place in the latter’s body. Do make whatever 	changes seem necessary. But keep me informed, as you did this time. 	I certainly wish that if no definite change is clearly visible this 	month, then you may spend a day in Delhi. Saraswati Gadodia owes her 	job to this remedy. Her guru is a kind maulvi. The only attraction 	for going to Delhi is that you can have the benefit of the advice of 	both. I carefully went 
 through Bhandari’s book for five minutes. I was not attracted by it. What I want is Indian equivalents for technical terms, not definitions. A definition of a motor-car can be given, but I heard it described as air-car only in Champaran. I cannot, therefore, give my opinion all at once. If you or somebody else tells me its special merits, then only can I express an opinion. There was a telegram from Bhandari to which I have not been able to reply, since I did not have a dictionary. Please convey this to him so that I need not write to him.
What you have written about surgery is quite correct.

149,"April 14, 1937",DISCUSSION WITH MISSIONARY libtech_198_footnote,"
    
 [Before April 14, 1937]libtech_199_footnote
 MISSIONARY: I have been following your comments on the statement regarding mass movement made by the Indian Christians. I wonder if those who made the statement were thinking of anything in the nature of a legal right. It is, I think, a moral right they claim here rather than a legal one.
 GANDHIJI: My criticism would apply even if they had used the word ‘moral right’. But it is clear that they mean a legal right, because for one thing there is no such thing as a moral right, and secondly because in the very next para of the manifesto, in which they have referred to the Karachi Resolutionlibtech_200_footnotelibtech_201_footnoteon Fundamental Rights, they make it clear that they mean by ‘right’ legal right. A moral right, if there is any such thing, does not need any asserting and defending.
 The main purpose of the manifesto was to check the agitation that is going on in certain quarters. I admit that if it was meant to be a protest, it was not properly drafted.
 That is why I have called it “an unfortunate document” And is there anything like a moral right? Give me an illustration.
 Have I not a moral right to speak?
 
 It is not a moral right, but a legal right. There is no right but is legal. Divorced from legality moral right is a misnomer.  And therefore you either enforce a right or fight for it. Whereas nobody asserts one’s duty. He humbly performs it. I shall take an illustration. You are here. You feel like preaching to me the Gospel. I deny the right and ask you to go away. If you regard praying for  me  a duty,you will quietly go away and pray for me. But if you claim the right to preach to me, you will call the police and appeal to them for preventing my obstructing you. That leads to a clash. But your duty no one dare question. You perform it here or elsewhere, and if your prayers to God to change my heart are genuine, God will change my heart. What Christianity, according to my interpretation of it, expects you to do is to pray to God to change my heart. Duty is a debt. Right belongs to a creditor, and it would be a funny thing indeed if a devout Christian claimed to be a creditor!
 You have objected to Christian propaganda on the ground that Harijans are illiterate and ignorant. What would you say of propaganda amongst non-Harijans?
 I have the same objection, because the vast mass of people of India would not understand the pros and cons of Christianity better than a cow. I repeat this simile in spite of the fact that it has been objected to. When I say I do not understand logarithms any better than my cow, I do not mean any insult to my intelligence. In matters of theology the non-Harijan masses can understand no better than Harijans. I would take you to Segaon and show you that there is no distinction, so far as capacity to understand such things is concerned, between Harijans and non-harijans. Try to preach the principles of Christianity to my wife. She can understand them no better than my cow. I can, because of the training that I have had.
 But we do not preach any theology. We simply talk of the life of Christ and tell them what a comfort His life and teaching have been to us. He has been our guide, we say, and ask others also to accept Him as their guide.
 Oh yes, you do say that. But when you say I must accept Jesus in preference to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, you will have to go into deep waters. That is why I say, let your life speak to us, even as the rose needs no speech but simply spreads its perfume. Even the blind who do not see the rose perceive its fragrance. That is the secret of the Gospel of the rose. But the Gospel that Jesus preached is more subtle and fragrant than the Gospel of the rose. If the rose needs no agent, much less does the Gospel of Christ need any agent.
 But then your objection is to the commercial aspect of the Christian propaganda. Every true Christian will agree that no baits should be offered.
 
 But what else is Christianity as it is preached nowadays? Not unless you isolate the proselytizing aspect from your educational andmedical institutions are they any worth. Why should students attending Mission schools and colleges be  compelled  or even expected to attend Bible classes? If they must understand the message of Jesus, why not also of Buddha, Zoroaster and Mahomed? Why should the bait of education be offered for giving education [sic]?
 That was the old way, not the modern way.
 I can cite to you any number of modern examples. Is not the Bishop of Dornakal a modern? And what else is his open letter to the Depressed Classes of India? It is full of baits.
 He represents a type of Christianity which I do not approve. But where there is no compulsion to attend the Bible classes, and only education is given,  what objection is there to educational institutions run by Missions?
 There is a subtle kind of propaganda when you expect students to attend Bible classes.
 As regards hospitals, I think philanthrophy without the dynamic[s] of some religious teaching will not tell.
 Then you commercialize your gift, for at the back of your mind is the feeling that because of your service some day the recipient of the gift will accept Christ. Why should not your service be its own reward?
 But leave alone these. I think I can cite instances of exceptionally fine people who attract people to them by the example of their lives.
 I too can cite such instances. Andrews is one such. But they are exceptions.
 But then you must judge Christianity by its best representatives, and not the
  worst.   I am not judging 	Christianity as a religion. I am talking of the 
  	way Christianity is being propagated, and you cannot judge it by 	exceptions, even as you may not judge the British system of 	Government by some fine specimens of Englishmen. No, let us think of 	the bulk of your people who preach the Gospel. Do they spread the 	perfume of their lives? That is to me the sole criterion. All I want 	them to do is to live Christian lives, not to annotate them. I have 	come to this view after laborious and prayerful search, and I am 	glad to say that there is a growing body of Christians who accept my 	view.  Then, 	I should be obliged to hear from you your attitude to the 	personality of  Jesus. 
 I have often made it clear. I regard Jesus as a great teacher of humanity, but I do not regard him as the only begotten son of God. That epithet in its material interpretation is quite unacceptable. Metaphorically we are all begotten sons of God, but for each of us there may be different begotten son of God in a special sense. Thus for me Chaitanya may be the only begotten son of God.
 But don’t you believe in the perfection of human nature, and don’t you believe that Jesus had attained perfection?
I believe in the perfectability of human nature. Jesus came as
 near to perfection as possible. To say that he was perfect is to deny God’s superiority to man. And then in this mater I have a theory of my own. Being necessarily limited by the bonds of flesh, we can attain perfection only after dissolution of the body. Therefore God alone is absolutely perfect. When he descends to earth, He of His own accord limits Himself. Jesus died on the Cross because he was limited by the flesh. I do not need either the prophecies or the miracles to establish Jesus’s greatness as a teacher. Nothing can be more miraculous than the three years of his ministry. There is no miracle in the story of the multitude being fed on a handful of loaves. A magician can create that illusion. But woe worth the day on which a magician would be hailed as the Saviour of humanity. As for Jesus raising the dead to life, well, I doubt if the men he raised were really dead. I raised a relative’s child from supposed death to life, but that was because the child was not dead, and but for my presence there she might have been cremated. But I saw that life was not extinct. I gave her an enema and she was restored to life. There was no miracle about it. I do not deny that Jesus had certain psychic powers and he was undoubtedly filled with the love of humanity. But he brought to life not people who were dead but who were believed to be dead. The laws of Nature are changeless, unchangeable, and there are no miracles in the sense of infringement or interruption of Nature’s laws. But we limited beings fancy all kind of things and impute our limitations to God. We may copy God, but not He us. We may not divide Time for Him, Time for Him is eternity. For us there is past, present and future. And what is human life of a hundred years but less than a mere speck in the eternity of Time?

156,"April 16, 1937","SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETING,HUDLI-
Ilibtech_212_footnote","
    
 April 16, 1937
 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 Please speak up if my voice does not reach you. I shall speak a little louder. I have agreed to say a few words before the President starts the discussion. During the next six days I shall try to participate in the meetings as much as I can.
 One thing I wish to mention right at the outset. When I arrived in the morning, someone remarked that if the Faizpur Congress was Jawaharlal’s, the Hudli Congress was going to be Gandhi’s. It was conveyed to me by the President or someone else. I know it was said in jest. But it pained me that such a thing should be said even in jest. It is a sin to imagine even in jest that there can be any rivalry between Jawaharlal and me, or the Congress and the Gandhi Seva Sangh. The Gandhi Seva Sangh is not opposed to the Congress. It is meant to serve the Congress. How could the Sangh be opposed to the Congress when it was conceived in order to carry out the constructive programme of the Congress? But I would go even further. The Congress represents the millions. The Sangh represents us. The members of the Sangh are either their own representatives or the representatives of truth and non-violence. You can say that the whole world should be the representative of truth and non-violence. But that is a different matter. The members of the Sangh would, under the present situation, represent only themselves. But do we not want to be the representatives of the millions as well? And it is the Congress which is pledged to be the voice of the suffering millions. How, then, can there be any opposition between us and the Congress? I would go to the extent of saying that the Sangh can have rivalry with none at all. Let no one suggest even in jest that there can possibly be any rivalry between the Sangh and the Congress. For, it would be an untruth. And it is forbidden to speak an untruth even in jest. Anyone who hears it must promptly stop it. I wish to give you a warning. Surely, we do not
 
 intend to indulge in a fight with anyone. We cannot even talk in such terms.
 Another thing which I wish to suggest is whether it would not be better to change the name of the Gandhi Seva Sangh. You have asso- ciated my name with the Sangh. This does not mean that my field of operation is limited only to this. I wish to make the whole of India my field of activity. I have suggested a way and you have accepted it. But it is not good for us to worship an individual. Only an ideal or a prin- ciple can be worshipped. You have agreed to carry out the progra- mme I placed before the country in 1920. Only that part of it which you have assimilated and digested belongs to you. My faith in that programme is brighter than ever. But will you abandon the pro- gramme if I say that my faith in it has dwindled? You cannot give it up even if I do so. You should not become my worshippers. You can worship truth and non-violence. When you have accepted a thing, it belongs to you independently. And only what independently belongs to you can be really yours. Like food, only what you have assimlated would serve you any purpose. When we accept someone’s ideas but do not digest them, absorb them intellectually but not emotionally anddo not translate them into practice, it is a kind of indigestion. It is an intellectual luxury. Ill-digested ideas are much worse than ill- digested food. There is a cure for ill-digested food; but ill-digested ideas harm the spirit and there is no cure for it. It is right that I should help you. You have right to pick up a quarrel with me if  I  say anything which is contrary to what I said in 1920. You must consider independently whether I have improved upon those ideas or allowed them to degenerate. Let me tell you that day by day I am marching ahead in the direction of progress and the application of my principles covers a wider field. You will have to judge if I am progressing in the right direction. You cannot do so if you do not exercise your power of independent judgment. The world will ridicule you if you keep on sticking to my name. But there is another and graver danger. I have a fear that the Sangh may degenerate into a sect. If such a thing is possible while I am still alive, what may not happen when I am gone? Whenever a difficult situation arises, you would refer to my writings in Young India and Harijan and swear by them to support your own argument. It would be proper to cremate all my writings with my body. I am not saying this out of any sense of modesty. Have I not already said that the world is not going to lose anything even if all our Vedas are destroyed and only the first mantra of Ishopanishad survives? And what purpose would be served even by that mantra if we do not understand it and follow it in our actions?
 Whatever I have said or written is useful only to the extent that it can help you in understanding and digesting the principles of truth and non-violence. Hence you must give a serious thought to what I am saying today.
 My faith in truth and non-violence becomes stronger every day. And as I go on applying these principles to my life, I go on making progress, and with that my ideas acquire a fresh quality. This does not mean that I am disorganized and my mind is not steady, or that my intellect is becoming shaky. I claim that my intellect has not lost its sharpness even though I have aged. It is not as if I was making thoughtless statements. My intellect continues to grow and in  the  matter of truth and non-violence it comes face to face with new things every day. And I find new light in them. I find new meanings in them every day. Hence, I continue to give new suggestions to the organizations like the Spinners’ Association, Harijan Sevak Sangh, Village Industries Association etc. This means that these organizationsand their organizers are very much alive. And like a tree they will go on acquiring a changing quality assuming ever new  forms. Their merit is that they should grow and progress. They would meet their downfall if they do not do so. I for one do not feel at all that I am going down. I want you to march with me in the direction of progress.
 I am not keen to know what would happen when I am dead. My only desire is that the Sangh should always grow like a tree. If you worship the ideals–not me–you should remove my name from the name of the Sangh. You should not be so much attached to my name. You must measure each action of yours with the yardstick of truth and non-violence. If you make this your yardstick, you will be able to deliberate on all problems without any fear even after I am gone. All of you who have come here should always be fully awake. You are going to face problems which will demand from you a fresh outlook.  I hope that with the light of truth you will be able to do so.

157,,SPINNERS’ WAGES,"
    
 The Council of the A. I. S. A. passed the following important resolutions at its meeting at Wardha on the 23rd and 24th ultimo:libtech_213_footnote
 
 When the scheme was inaugurated many workers had grave doubts about its success. They had thought that the consequent rise in the price of khadi will adversely affect the sales. Experience has dispelled the fears and the Council is anxious to take a further step forward, if it can at all be taken, at an early date. Whilst, therefore, there need be no haste about taking the further step, workers may not be lazy about it either. They should know that the goal is eight annas per day of eight hours. We have only nominally reached three annas which are evenly distributed between increase and efficiency. The efficiency earnings do not directly affect the sale price. If anything, the efficiency of spinners improves the quality of khadi. The direct increase in the wages undoubtedly raises the prices, but its burden is broken by the improvement in quality. Then the increase is sojudiciously regulated as to affect the poorest buyer not at all or very slightly. I have no manner of doubt that if only the workers will themselves be more efficient, more vigilant and more faithful, they will hasten the day when spinners can easily earn eight annas per day of eight hours’ work without involving a phenomenal rise in the sale price. More scientific knowledge must improve the capacity of hand- gins, carding-bows and spinning-wheels. Greater observation of spinners’ work must result in their being more skilled and more efficient. Greater grasp of administrative detail  and  greater faithfulness must mean a substantial decrease in overhead charges. In other words, our ignorance of the science of khadi is at the bottom of our present inability to reach the goal of eight annas per day. The resolution is intended as a spur to effort. God helps only the ever- watchful.

158,,BAD IF TRUE,"
    
 Shri P. O. Philip of the National Christian Council has received the following complaint from Travancore:
 Many thanks for your letter. I am consoled by the fact that the Mahatma will use his influence in removing the ill-feeling of the caste Hindus in Travancore towards Christians and the Depressed Class converts. Last week, while my evangelist Jacob was returning from a Church in North Travancore after the baptism of eight Pariahs, he was stopped by a Hindu Excise (Government) peon and was seriously assulted. One of his eyes is injured by the blows. The peon said the evangelist had no business to teach and prepare people for baptism after the Temple-entry Proclamation. I have written about this to the The Madras Mail and the Manorama, but my note has not appeared
 
 in the papers. Will you please give publicity to the hideous act? Such acts are not isolated ones, but are perpetrated with the knowledge of influential caste Hindus who want to suppress if possible the progress of Christianity. You may forward a copy of this note to Mr. Gandhi. Communal hatred is on the increase after the Temple-entry Proclamation!
 A similar complaint was received by me a few weeks  ago through the same source. I have forwarded the papers to the Travancore Harijan Sevak Sangh for investigation. Meantime I have the foregoing. The brief postcard contains most serious allegations. The writer claims that
 the 	acts are 	not isolated;  they 	are perpetrated 	with the 	knowledge of 	influential caste 	Hindus;  caste 	Hindus want to suppress 	if possible the progress 	of Christianity;  communal 	hatred is on the 	increase after the 	Temple-entry 	Proclamation. 
 Now these statements ought not to be lightly made. I advise the writer to furnish proofs to the Harijan Sevak Sangh who, I promise, will thoroughly investigate the whole complaint. The Sangh has a retired High Court judge as its President and a most conscientious and cultured man as its Secretary. I myself will have no hesitation in denouncing the slightest departure by caste Hindus from the strictest non-violence. It is difficult for me to see why  communal  hatred should be on the increase because of the Temple-entry Proclamation. Certainly I observed none during my recent tour in Travancore. And in so far as specific charges of molestation are concerned I would advise Shri Philip’s correspondent to file complaints in  the  local courts. I may mention that I received complaints of a contrary nature from caste Hindus alleging that Harijans living in or near Christian cheris were molested by Christians. I refused to publish the statements and referred the writers to the local courts. I would have likewise treated the foregoing postcard but for the very serious allegations contained in it. They could only be dealt with publicly and by a public investigation.

159,,159. A. I. V. I. A. TRAINING SCHOOL,"
 This school has gone through several vicissitudes because of the inexperience of the management. The A. I. V. I. A. has to cut its way as it proceeds through an unbeaten track. A year’s experience and
 experimenting have made the management less ambitious.  The teachers themselves are training themselves through experimenting. And when the next terms commences, there will be greater preparedness than hitherto. Here is the unambitious but more realistic prospectus of the school:libtech_214_footnote
 The academic year of the All-India Village Industries Association Training School for Village Workers will begin from Ist July 1937. . . .
  Hindi 		will be the medium 		of instruction.  The 		course will 		be as far 		as may 		be for 		a period 		of 12 months, 		of which 		two months 		will have to 		be spent in 		village-uplift centres 		for practical 		study. In 		the first 		10 months 		training in the 		following industries, 		together with 		some theoretical knowledge for 		village work, will be given:  
 Paddy-husking 	and grinding Paper-making Oil-pressing 	by ghani Date-palm 	gur  making Bee-keeping 
 Students will have to select one of the above industries and devote six hours every day to it.
  Students 	will be 	examined at the end of the year and, if found necessary, 	the course 	may be prolonged.  Applicants 	for admission 	should not be 	less than 18 	years of 	age and 	should possess a 	healthy body. On 	arrival, such 	of those as 	the School Committee 	requires will undergo preliminary examination and will be expected  	to pass a test equal to what is known as the Vernacular Middle 	Course, and may be 	rejected if 	they do 	not possess 	adequate knowledge. They 	should have a working 	knowledge of Hindi, 	should be habitual 	wearers of khadi 	and should 	be prepared 	to do manual 	work such as sanitary 	service, kitchen work and 	spinning, and 	such other work 	as may 	be required 	under the discipline 	of the 	School. . . . 
Let the applicants study the prospectus carefully. Those who are
 disinclined to do manual labour and apply themselves to the practical learning of the industry of their choice will be disappointed. Those who appreciated the necessity of mastering the industries mentioned will find ample scope for their talents.

  "
160,,FOR STUDENTS,"
    
 Though this letterlibtech_215_footnotelibtech_216_footnotewas received about the end of February last, I am able to deal with it only now. It raises issues of great importance, each demanding large enough space for two columns of Harijan. But I must be brief.
 The very difficulties the student raises, though serious in their setting, are of his own making. The very mention of them must show the falsity of his position and of the educational system  in  our country. It turns education into a purely commercial product to be converted into money. For me education has a much nobler purpose. Let the student count himself as one among millions and he will discover that millions of young men and women of his age cannot fulfil the conditions which he will have his degree to do. Why should he make himself responsible for the maintenance of all the relatives he mentions? Why should the grown-up ones, if of sound body, not labour for their maintenance? It is wrong to have many drones to one busy bee—though a male.
 The remedy lies in his unlearning many things. He must revise his ideas of education. His sisters ought not to repeat the expensive education that he had. They can develop their intelligence through learning some handicraft in a scientific manner. The moment they do so, they have development of the mind side by side with that of the body. And if they will learn to regard themselves as servants of humanity rather than its exploiters, they will have development of the heart, i.e., the soul as well. And they will become equal earners of bread with their brother.
 I might as well discuss here his sister’s marriage to which reference has been made in the letter. I do not know what is meant by marriage taking place ‘sooner rather than later’. In no case need it take place before they are 20 years old. It is no use thinking so many years in advance. And if he will revise the whole scheme of life, he willhave the sisters to choose their partners and the ceremony need never cost more than five rupees each, if that. I have been present at several such ceremonies. And the husbands or their elders have been graduates in fair circumstances.
 
 
 It is pathetic to find the student so helpless as not to know how and where to have spinning lessons. Let him make a diligent search in Lucknow and he will find that there are young men enough to teach him. But he need not confine himself to spinning, though it too is fast becoming a full-time occupation able to give a village-minded man or woman his or her livelihood. I hope I have said here sufficient to enable him to dot the i’s and cross the t’s.
 And now for contraceptives. Even here, the difficulty is imaginary. He is wrong in underrating his wife’s intelligence. I have no doubt whatsoever that if she is the ordinary type of womanhood, she will readily respond to his self-restraint. Let him be true to himself and ask himself whether he has enough of it himself. All the evidence in my possession goes to show that it is man who lacks the power of self-restraint more than woman. But there is no need for belittling his own inability to exercise restraint. He must manfully face the prospect of a large family and discover the best means of suporting them. He must know that against the millions who are strangers to the use of contraceptives, there are possibly a few thousand who use them. The millions are in no dread of having to breed their children though the latter may not all be wanted. I suggest that it is cowardly to refuse to face the consequences of one’s acts. Persons who use contraceptives will never learn the virtue of self-restraint. They will not need it. Self- indulgence with contraceptives may prevent the coming of children but will sap the vitality of both men ad women–perhaps more of men than of women. It is unmanly to refuse battle with the devil. Let my correspondent resolve upon  self-restraint as the only sure and honourable method of avoiding unwanted children. What though he and his fail in the effort a hundred times? Joy is in the battle. The result comes by the grace of God.

161,,‘OUR PARTIAL SIGHT’,"
    
 The reader will remember Rajkumari Amrit Kaur’s letterlibtech_217_footnotelibtech_218_footnoteto me published in these columns some weeks ago. She received on it, some time ago, a letter from an English friend. She sent it to me to read. It contained so much that was good that I asked for permission  to publish the relevant portion. This she readily gave and copied it for me. Here are the passages:
 
 I have been meaning to write to you ever since I read in Harijan your fine letter to Mr. Gandhi. I want to tell you how very much I feel with you about what you said with regard to missionary work and to thank you for saying it in your own way to a man like Mahatmaji. When I was in India, first as a very undeveloped girl thrust into a C. M. S. atmosphere, very many years ago, I felt that the approach of the missionaries to the people of India was all wrong and   I had lonely times of being up against the whole system and yet not exactly being able to formulate my idea or talk to others with any chance of being understood. I was also set wondering if we as British people had any right to be ruling India, and I remember expressing this in those early days and being firmly dealt with! But ever since those days as my thought life has developed I have been getting to feel that fundamentally the whole position of the British in India was wrong and that the missionaries as a whole were sharing in the superiority complex of those who ruled. I am regarded, I know, as a real black sheep in missionary circles. So I can thoroughly sympathize with criticism that I am sure you have met with from those quarters! But what you said needed saying by someone who was a Christian and who yet saw a different way of sharing her faith with others. And it makes all the difference when someone like you who is known and has a position in the country says these things.
 We sing in our Churches in England that grand hymn, whose words I expect you know, written by that inspired blind poet George Matheson:
 Gather us in; we worship only thee
 In varied names we stretch a common hand; In diverse forms a common soul we see;
 In many ships we seek one spirit land; Gather us in.
 Each sees one colour in Thy rainbow light, Each looks upon one tint and calls it heaven, Thou art the fulness of OUR partial sight;
 We are not perfect till we find the seven; Gather us in.
 Anyway it is a step beyond ‘From Green Land’s lcy Mountains’! But I sometimes wonder if the people here who sing this realize its implications.

 I received your letter. The questions you have askedlibtech_219_footnotecan   be raised more or less about all [religions]. I am just telling you my impression after reading the whole biography of the Prophet. If I start looking for imperfections and faults, I can find many but while doing so a man begins to despair and there is no reason to despair.
 I left out about the hearing of the inner voice because while replying I did not have your letter before me. One who wants to hear the inner voice should observe five yamaslibtech_220_footnote. The rules laid down for the observance of yamas should be adhered to and in order to do that one should devote as much time as possible to the repetition of His name so that it becomes as orderly as natural as breathing and the repetition should become as the beating of our heart. We do not hear our heartbeats but the heart goes on beating. Similarly the repetition of His name should go on. I have written on the subject many times in my articles.

165,"April 	17, 1937","SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETING,","
    
 HUDLI-II
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  April 	17, 1937 
  	At the outset I wish to say a few things which are not relevant to 	the subject under discussion. Dr. Batra is here. I had requested him 	to give a helping hand in the sanitation arrangements. He told me a 	few things which I want to tell you about.  	First, the soil here is sandy. For washing we need alkali in more or 	less degree. Sand contains no alkali. It is to be found only in 	earth. Therefore earth is our soap. We cannot wash our hands as 	effectively with sand as with earth. We should remember that there 	should either be earth placed in heaps outside latrins or members 	should use soap to wash their hands.     
 Second, it has been noticed that some people put their soiled utensils into the drums filled with water. This is bad for health and bad according to tradition.
 Third, those who serve are sometimes seen to serve liquids with their hands instead of with ladles. We should always serve liquids with a spoon or a ladle. Devotees of Truth should pay attention to small things. If they do not, they are lazy and laziness is a form of violence.
 Now take the subject under consideration. It is a good thing that this discussion is taking place. I have myself been confused and I am still not very clear. I do not wholly agree with what Gangadharraolibtech_221_footnoteand Acharya Bhagwat have said: It is of course correct that a man cannot go by his own opinion in everything. Where we are not sure of the correctness of our opinion we should consult our elders. The consultation is necessary. But it is not so here. I myself wanted to know your opinion as to whether we should go into Legislatures. This is not something which we should decide for all time. I know that my opposition to going into Legislatures has not considerably softened. But there has been no loss of principle here. And where there is no loss of principle involved I like to know what people’s wishes are. I am a worshipper of Truth and I am also a servant of the people. I am affected by the atmosphere. My response is generally in conformity with the atmosphere. What I said at Patna was correct for the time. What I said at Faizpur was also correct. I keep myself equipped for meeting the needs of the season. If it rains I use an umbrella, if it is cold I can wrap myself in woollens and in summer there is muslin which is light as air or some such thing to cover me. People have agreed that this is right. There has been no change in my ideas. But I express them in keeping with the prevailing wind.
Now I take the question Kakasaheb has posed. He asks whether
 I am the same man who had advocated non-co-operation from 1920 to 1922 or whether I have changed. My answer is that I am the same man. If I was a non-co-operator then, I am a non-co-operator now. But the fact is that even at that time I was in reality a co-operator. A British magistrate had told me that, though I showed myself as a non- co-operator, at heart I sought co-operation I told him that he was right. Non-co-operation is not something I have accepted for all time. When I find that India can advance through co-operation, I will accept
 
 co-operation. Following my 21daylibtech_222_footnotefast I had said in a statement that co-operation was my religion and that I would die for co-operation provided I got it with honour.
 Today We are going into the Legislatures not to give but to take co-operation. The atmosphere today is changed. We will have to seek remedies to suit the change in the atmosphere. I must refer here to something Premabehn saidlibtech_223_footnotelibtech_224_footnoteyesterday. Whether she said it in jest or as sacrasm does not matter. But I cannot understand what kind of jest it was. It was no occasion for jest. I could only conclude that she said it out of her experience. If that was so, it is not right. My own experience is the opposite. I have not become what I am in the sense it has been suggested. Truth came to me when I was yet an infant. Ahimsa came to me when I was eighteen. My intellect was not mature then. Even today I do not pride myself on my intellect. At school the teachers did not consider me a very bright boy. They knew I was a good boy, but not a bright boy. I never knew first class and second class. I barely passed. I was a dull boy. I could not even speak properly. Even when I went to South Africa I went ony as a clerk. I did not go anywhere, like Pherozeshah Mehta, charging a thousand rupees as day’s fee. I was to get £ 150 annually. My knowledge of rules and regulations was nil. I am not a learned man. I am a worshipper of Truth. In South Africa I found myself in the midst of Muslims. Mohammed I know only as a name. About Muslims I knew nothing. I told them the story of Harishchandra. Even this absurdity influenced them a great deal. Much later I took to politics. But the groundwork had been laid much before. When I saw that in the interests of Truth and non-violence I had to take part in politics I did so. But my experience is that my influence among people is not because of my political work. This is hundred per cent true. If at Saswad the experience is different, I do not know. But this has been my experience all along. I went to Champaran also at the request of
 
 
 Brijkrishore Babulibtech_225_footnotelibtech_226_footnote. I had merely seen him. People also knew him only as a lawyer. He had not even heard of the Congress. I told them all not even to mention the Congress. Rajendra Babu never even dreamt of bringing him into the Congress. This occured to me later. Even today there are thousands in India who have no need of swaraj. Take Segaon itself, where I live. It is in Maharashtra and people in Maharashtra are very political-minded. But even they don’t ask for swaraj. I do not mention Congress to them, because they will not understand it. They understand the question of untouchability and they also oppose untouchability. To women I talk about the charkha, about children. If  I speak to them about the Legislatures they may ask me if I would bring them a couple of bags of foodgrains from there. What is the condition of India as a whole today? The talk of bread is all that the people understand. They have no use for politics. I  have  led campaigns in all parts of India, but never in the name of the Congress. Nowhere have I worked in that fashion. Today in Champaran people in their thousands talk about the Congress. It is the fruit of those six months of work in the course of which the Congress was not so much as mentioned. They repect the Congress because they consider these gentlemen their well-wishers.
 There may be some amongst you, too, who think that Truth and non-violence will advance only through politics. I must tell them very clearly that Truth and non-violence are not dependent on anything. They are independent forces. If you want to be the worshippers of what Khan Saheb calls Allah, what I call Rama and Christian call Christ or God, you may do so. If you don’t wish so, no harm is done to Him. If God is independent of you and me, He does not need politics. He does not need you and me. There are millions who are in quest of Him. Very few have had a glimpse of Him. I myself have been worshipping him for the last fifty years. In Him I find daily new strength, new things. If today I find it necessary to argue with you it means that I have not been able to imbibe all these things to the extent I should have. What is moral strength? Ramanama is the same thing for all. But when one man utters the name it makes an impact. Another’s uttering makes none. What is the reason? The reason is that
 
 
 one has merged oneself in it. Another plays upon it as one might on  a sitar or a violin. A parrot also utters Ramanama, but it does not touch its heart. It cannot understand its significance. I am not a worshipper of small things. Can a man who has been saying that no man is his guru, who has accepted no living person as his guru, be a worshipper of something that depends on politics? Truth and non- violence are precious commodities. They are neutral; they are unique things and the articles needed for their worship are also unique. Let Premabehn not forget all this.
 Jamnalalji has said that if we go into the Legislatures today we cannot pursue Truth and non-violence. He has uttered something of great import. I don’t agree with it. If Truth and non-violence cannot be pursued, then democracy also cannot be practised, for in that case it will be against Truth and non-violence. If you believe in democracy we shall have to work for the good of the millions. To do good to the millions we cannot all of us assemble in one place. We shall have to elect a few representatives. If they are true servants of the people, if they are true democrats, they will, with a pure heart, try to understand the wishes of the people and will voice them. When in 1920 the question arose of amending the objective of the Congress and Bipin Chandra Pal suggested democratic swaraj in place of swaraj, I opposed it because when I analyse swaraj I find that without democracy there can be no swaraj. What Pal intended was implied in the word swaraj itself. In swaraj, too, the Legislatures will retain more or less their present structure, though it is possible there may be some change in the external form. Let us sit as we are sitting here instead of in chairs and palaces. About one-third of the people who should have the right to vote have acquired the franchise. After some time the number ofvoters may reach 120 million. It is no small thing that today 30 million people can vote. Thousands of our workers have approached them and this had never been done before. The Congress message has spread more widely. It is not a small thing. I had been thinking whether it is right for members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh to carry this message. I told those who asked me that there was no harm in doing so. So long as there is room in the Congress for Truth and non- violence, so long as it does not say good-bye to the programme of 1920, we shall continue to be an organ of the Congress. We are not an
 institution created under the Congress. We are a voluntary  organization. The All-India Spinners’ Association, and All-India Village Industries Association are organization created by the Congress. But Gandhi Seva Sangh is not created by the Congress. It came into existence in 1923 to save the programme of 1920 at a time when I was undergoing six years’ imprisonment and when there was no talk of my being released. Even if the Congress gives up constructive programme tomorrow, the Sangh will not cease to exist. It will carry on that programme. Constructive programme  is the permanent programme of Gandhi Seva Sangh. If it gives it up it will cease to be. In 1923 Motilalji and other leaders had taken the  Councils programme in hand. It was not for us to quarrel with them. We also had to keep intact this real programme of the  Congress because I know that if the Congress gives up the programme of 1920, it will be destroyed. What else could we have done in such a situation? Today also I say that there is no other programme besides this. But constructive programme is not like Truth and non-violence valid for all time. Take the charkha. If you go to the North Pole or to the Himalayan peaks or to Tibet, the talk of cotton won’t do. Still I say that the constructive programme is for the good of our millions. Legislatures are only for a few. But the contructive programme is for all. Therefore it is right for me to stay with the thirty crores who stand appart from the three crore. Only a few will go, can go, into the Legislatures. I have told people who have written to me asking my advice not to get themeselves into this. But they did the very opposite saying they couldn’t help it. Sardar took away forcibly even those people whom we wanted to keep. The example of Dr. Gopichand of the Punjab is before you. The same thing happened with  others. Sardar was responsible for this betrayal. I had to say that what he had done was right. If he had not done it he would have been defeated at any rate in Gujarat. If I had told Rajaji not to go, he would not havegone. But if today I am asked, I shall say that what he did was right. The matter has an interesting history. Rajaji asked my opinion, but after going, not before. He considered it his duty to go and he went. I said I did not like it. But he did the right thing. Much work has been done in Madras. The workers there are members of the Spinners’ Association. Most of the work was done through them.
 
 Today Rajagopalachari has left. Tomorrow if I ask Sardar Vallabhbhai, Rajendra Babu or Jamnalalji, they may also leave. But then our Sangh will be reduced into a small band.
 We want that everyone should become a  member of  the  Sangh. But thequestion before me today is, if we stop everyone who is with us from going into the Conuncils, will it not harm our own work? For where will the Congress find men? And members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh did just this. I feel that they have done their duty. If they had not done so the Congress would not have been victorious in the same degree as it is. The Sangh is of no importance as compared with the Congress. The Congress  is of  the  millions. We cannot leave it. It has accepted this programme on a permanent basis. It is not that they have accepted it under duress. The thing is clear before us. We cannot give it up. Those  who go  into  the  Legislatures  today do  not go  in  to Government’s Legislatures. They go into their own Legislatures. What I have  said  is  the  truth. We  have  become  the  representatives  of the people. Formerly only the representatives of the Government or of a handful of people  went  into the Legislatures. The eprentatives of   the   people	have	laid   down	their   condition	before the Government. If Truth and non-violence have to be practised in Legislatures, who will do so if not you? We have to increase  the  strength of  the Congress. You may  ask,  well, why  in  that case  have    I gone out of  the Congress? If  I have gone out of  the Congress, it is  in order to be able to serve  it  better. So long as the Congress  needs my services I shall continue to render them. I do not feel any isappointment. I have not gone to settle in Segaon out of any frustration.  Whatever  little  strength  I  have  is  for  the  Congress.  The Congress is mine. The  ideas  I  am  placing  before you  have  been  influenced  by  the  opinions  of  you all.  In brief,  what I wish  to say is that we have to find a place for this programme. But the estriction is that we shall continue our own work till then. If  our leader, Kishorelal—not  Vallabhbhai—orders  us,  we  shall go  into  the Councils also.
 Dharmadhikari asks whether as satyagrahis we can enter institutions opposed to us to voice our opposition there. Yes, why shouldn’t we? But you must always remember the limits  of satyagraha. We shall not go to betray or to offer violence. It may even be our duty to go in order to offer our open opposition. But here this  is not the question. Legislatures are not institutions opposed to us. I like Legislatures. They are mine. The Governor has been made the
 head. But the institution is mine. The Governor of Orissa knows this. With the help of Legislatures I wish to destroy this system. We are going into the Legislatures to gain strength. We are not going into the Legislatures to paralyse them. We go even to our enemy in order to change his heart. Supposing there is a meeting of drunkards and it invites us to go and speak on the evils of drinking. We shall certainly go. Someone may say they may burn us. Well, what of it? We shall die. What is important is, why we go. Do we go to advance Truth or to obstruct it? Let us go into the Legislatures to pursue Truth. After all the Legislatures are ours. Aren’t they? The majority there is ours. Now that we have an opportunity to accept the challenge, shall we stay out? When we can openly go into the arena to meet our enemy, why shouldn’t we? We do not go to beg, but to sap the enemy’s strength. Have we spent five lakhs or seven lakhs of rupees for nothing? Today we have had to spend all this money. When the Congress has risen in people’s esteem we will not have to spend even a cowrie. We boast of a constructive programme. I have been shouting in the pages of Harijan, how many charkha graduates are there? How  many graduates for removal of untouchability? The answer is zero. Had conditions been different, the question of spending anything would never have arisen. We have to mobilize all our energies in order to serve.We have to march fully observing Truth and non-violence. We must always be armed with the two weapons of fearlessness and discipline. We will have to use them in Parliament. Carlyle once said that members of the House of Commons had not much need of common sense. This is bound to be so where there is democracy. The main thing a discipline. Obey your leader and ply your taklis there in silence. We need just such men. They need no legal or constitutional knowledge. Why should we not go into our own house? It is true everyone cannot go. Still everyone has to vote. I do not agree with Appa. Everybody has to be a primary voter. You may ask me why I have not become a voter. That is for a different reason. Not that I have not been given the right to vote, only I did not want to be a voter. My position is different and it is valid only for myself. The members of the Sangh are votaries of Truth. He whom the Gandhi Seva Sangh orders to go will go. The question is not of individuals. It is not a question of temptation of self-interest. He who goes there out or greed
 or self-interest will be or brtraying not only the Gandhi Seva Sangh  but also Truth. He who thinks of the charkha all the 24 hours can do so in the Legislatures also. He does not have to exercise his mind there. He has merely to raise his band at a signal from his leader. It is not a predicament. It is our dharma. We are the servants of Daridranarayana. We shall go there as servants and if the Congress
 
 gives the call. If we can form ministeries on our own conditions, then we have found the way to swaraj. If such men go into the Legislatures, we shall not meet with defeat even in one of the eleven provinces. If the Congress does not call us we should remain where we are. This is not a question of superior or inferior. The constructive programme and this programme are both equal.libtech_227_footnote
 As regards the oath of allegiance, I should ask no one to go there who has a conscientious objection to the oath. It is not a  religious oath, so far as I understand the constitution, and it is wholly consistent with the demand for immediate and concrete independence.

 "
166,,SACRIFICE OF RAS,"
    
 At the instance of Sardar, Shrimati Bhaktibehnlibtech_228_footnoteShri Ashabhai, Shri Ravishankarlibtech_229_footnote, who is the priest of the Dharalas and the Baraiyas, and Shri Ravjibhailibtech_230_footnoteapproached me on behalf of the Kaira district. Sardar also happened to be present. These representatives had heard that I was inclined to hold the Congress session in the Bardoli taluk. I had read the report of the enquiry committee. After a long  and friendly discussion, I think I was able to persuade the representatives to shift the venue of the Congress session to the Bardoli taluk. I had only one strong argument to support me. Kaira is a strong district. No one is ignorant of the sacrifice made by Ras. I also believe that Ras would do credit to whatever task it takes upon itself. However, when other districts or taluks wish to compete, it is the dharma of the strong competitor to withdraw in favour of the weak. I suggested such a sacrifice to the representatives, and they accepted my proposal. When Darbar Saheb heard of this decision, he was annoyed and he wrote to me an affectionate but strongly worded letter in which he justified by many arguments the worthiness of the Kaira district.
I  would give only one reply to those who hold such a  view: If
 you wish to add to the strength of the Congress, i.e., of Gujarat, will you allow those who are weak to become strong, or allow those who are strong to become even more so? Ras has become more famous for its strength in the already strong Kaira district. Hence the above
 
 was my first and final reply to the supporters of Ras. Many other things were discussed in the mean time because, where many side- issues have to be considered, a single consideration does not make a person act; there are many factors–palpable and less palpable–that must be considered.
 In whichever village of Gujarat the Congress is held, all Gujaratis have to work for it on the understanding that it is being held in Gujarat taken as a whole. The most important task at the  annual session of the Congress should be to make the exhibition impressive. It is an indispensable part of the session. We increase our efficiency by organizing a beautiful exhibition; hundreds of thousands of persons get valuable training; the entire rural area becomes revitalized as our primary purpose is to encourage cottage industries. Hence I hope that Gujaratis will forget that the Congress is to be held in the Bardoli taluk and keep reminding themselves that it is to be held in Gujarat and use all their energies in consolidating the constructive work of the Congress.
 Gujarat is backward in many matters. In one matter it  lags behind all other Provinces–in abolishing untouchability. The caste discrimination which is practised here is not seen in any other Provinces. That kind of discrimination should be totally done away with. Gujarat also falls behind other Provinces in so far as the production of khadi is concerned. In fact Bardoli had  taken  the pledge that within six months the spinning-wheel would ply in every home and no other cloth but khadi would be used there and untouchability would be totally wiped out. Will Bardoli and the entire people of Gujarat start making preparation from today so that khadi would be really introduced? Hundreds of thousands of rupees are spent by Gujarat in the name of goseva but does anybody know the value of mother cow? How much cow’s milk is produced? And how much difficulty is experienced in selling what little is produced! It is Sardar’s pledge to supply cow’s milk to everyone at the Congress session. If that pledge is to be kept, Bardoli taluk should  start collecting cows right now and an exhibition of cows and bullocks, the like of which has never been seen, should be held at the time of the Congress session. Moreover, Surat district is notorious for drinking. If the evil is totally given up in that district before the Congress session, that would be a very creditable achievement. Women can play an important role in all these tasks. Will they do so? Will the Patidars, the Dharalas, Baraiyas, Thakores, whatever you call them, plunge into the tasks I have mentioned, looking upon the holding of the Congress in Bardoli taluk as if it was being held in the Kaira district or in Ras itself? The sacrifice of Ras is great; so is its renown. If, despite the
 Congress not being held there, Ras makes its own handsome contribution, it will add to its own prestige and to that  extent  strengthen itself also.

167,"April 	18, 1937",ADVICE TO NEWLY MARRIED COUPLES libtech_231_footnote,"
          HUDLI, 
  [April 	18, 1937]libtech_232_footnote  	You must know that I do not believe in ceremonies, except to the 	extent that they awaken in us a sense of duty. I have had that 	attitude of mind ever since I began to think for myself. The mantras 	you have repeated and the vows you have taken were all in 	Sanskrit, but they were all translated for you. We had the Sanskrit 	text because I know that the Sanskrit word has a power under the 	influence of which one would love to come.  	One of the wishes expressed by the husband during  the ceremony is 	that the bride may be the mother of a good and healthy son. The wish 	did not shock me. It does not mean that procreation is obligatory 	but means that if progeny is wanted, marriage performed in a 	strictly religious spirit is essential. He who does not want a child 	need not marry at all. Marriage for the satisfaction of sexual 	appetite is no marriage. It is Vyabhichara–concupiscence. 	Today’s ceremony, therefore, means that the sexual act is 	permitted only when there is a clear desire by both for a child. The 	whole conception is sacred. The act has therefore to be performed 	prayerfully. It is not preceded by the usual courtship designed to 	provide sexual excitement and pleasure. Such union may only be once 	in a lifetime, if no other child is desired. Those who are not 	morally and physically healthy have no business to unite, and if 	they do, it is vyabhichara–concupiscence. You must unlearn 	the lesson, if you have learnt it before, that marriage is for the 	satisfaction of animal appetite. It is a superstition. The whole 	ceremony is performed in the presence of the sacred fire. Let the 	fire make ashes of all the lust in you. I 	would also ask you to disabuse yourselves of another     
 superstition which is rampant nowadays. It is being said that restraint and abstinence are wrong and free satisfaction of the sexual appetite and free love is the most natural thing. There was never a more  ruinous superstition. You may be incapable of attaining the  ideal, your flesh may be weak, but do not therefore lower the ideal, do not make irreligion your religion. In your weak moments remember what  I am telling you. The remembrance of this solemn occasion may well steady and restrain you. The very purpose of marriage is restraint and sublimation of the sexual passion. If there is any other purpose, marriage is no consecration, but marriage for other purposes besides having progeny.
 You are being united in marriage as friends and equals. If the husband is called swamin, the wife is swamini–each master of the other, each helpmate of the other, each co-operating with the other in the performance of life’s tasks and duties. To you boys I would say that if you are gifted with better intellects and richer emotions, infect the girls with them. Be their true teachers and guides, help them and guide them, but never hinder them or misguide them. Let there be complete harmony of thought and word and deed between you, may you have no secrets from each other, may you be one in soul.
 Don’t be hypocrites, don’t break your health in the vain effort of performing what may be impossible for you. Restraint never ruins one’s health. What ruins one’s health is not restraint but outward suppression. A really self-restrained person grows every day from strength to strength and from peace to more peace. The very first step in self-restraint is the restraint of thoughts. Understand your limitations and do only as much as you can. I have placed the ideal before you–the right angle. Try as best as you can to attain the right angle. But if you fail, there is no cause for grief or shame. I have simply explained to you that marriage is consecration, a new birth, even as the sacred thread ceremony is a consecration and a new birth. Let not what I have told you alarm you or weaken you. Always aim at complete harmony of thought and word and deed. Always aim at purifying your thoughts and everything will be well. There is nothing more potent than thought. Deed follows word and word follows thought. The world is the result of a mighty thought, and where the thought is mighty and pure the result is always mighty and pure. I want you to go hence armed with the armour of a noble ideal, and I assure you no temptation can harm you, no impurity can touch you.
 Remember the various ceremonies that have been explained to you. Look at the simple-looking ceremony of madhuparka. The whole world is full of madhu–sweet nectar or honey–if only you will partake of it after the rest of the world has taken its share of it. It
 means enjoyment by means of renunciation.
 QUESTION: But if there is no desire for progeny, should there be no marriage?
 ANSWER: Certainly not. I do not believe in Platonic marriages. In certain rare cases men are known to have married women to protect the latter and not for any physical union at all. But those cases are very rare indeed. You must read all that I have written on pure married life. What I read in the Mahabharata is daily growing upon me. Vyasa is described therein as having performed niyoga. He is not described as beautiful, but he was the reverse of it. His form is represented as terrible, he made no amorous gestures, but he smeared his whole body with ghee before he performed the union. He performed the act not for lust but for procreation. The desire for a child is perfectly natural, and once the desire is satisfied there should be no unionlibtech_233_footnote.
 Nurturing carnal desires is a transgression of the law. The desire for progeny is a natural desire. In woman, one finds that there is a desire to become a mother. That desire is not the same as sexual desire. Anyone who wishes to become a mother, once she has had sexual intercourse, will have no further desire for it. She will keep thinking only of her child, she will make efforts to see that her child is healthy, free from any diseases and is born with the best possible sanskaras libtech_234_footnote. This natural rule is practised among animals as well. The reason why lustfulness is increasing in the world is that no one is aware of this kind of marriage.
 This pure dharma is not difficult to practise. Just as even dry roti arouses the interest of anyone who is hungry, similarly, the practice of dharma, self-control, also becomes interesting.Anyone who practises self-restraint finds it easy to develop his other senses. Manu calls the first son alone dharmaja, all the rest are kamaja (born out of desire). Our Shastras have been written from experience, not for the sake of writing. The practice of seemingly difficult rules (laws) would become easy if we keep purifying our thoughts and practising these.
 That gives in a nutshell the law of sexual relations. And what is God but the Law? And to obey God is to perform the Law. Remember that you were thrice asked to repeat: “I will not transgress the Law in any respect.” Even if we had a handful of men and women prepared to abide by the Law, we should have a race of men and  women stalwart and true.
Remember that I really came to enjoy my married life after I
 
 ceased to look at Ba sexually. I took the vow of abstinence when I was in the prime of youth and health, when I was young enough to enjoy married life in the accepted sense of the term. I saw in a flash that I was born, as we all are, for a sacred mission. I did not know this when  I was married. But on coming to my senses I felt that I must see that the marriage subserved the mission for which I was born. Then indeed did I realize true dharma. True happiness came into our lives only after the vow was taken.libtech_235_footnote
 That dharma of restraint can only be practised when all the things which nurture sexual desires are renounced, when sharing the same bed as well as suggestive gestures are eschewed. I realized all this when I became awakened. If the satisfying of sexual desires is not the purpose of marriage, what then is its purpose? I realized that public service was the answer to this question and I was also able to convince Ba of this. Although she is illiterate she stood beside me in all that I did and became the object of praise, not because of me but in her ownright. She may look frail but at the age of sixty-nine she can keep toiling day and night. If, however, we had given in to sexual craving, what would have been our plight?
 And yet I woke up late in the sense that I had lived the married life for some years. You are lucky enough to be aroused in good time. Circumstances when I was married were as unpropitious as they could be. For you they are as propitious as they could be. There was one thing though that I possessed and that carried me through. It was the armour of truth. That protected me and saved me. Truth has been the very foundation of my life. Brahmacharya and ahimsa were born later out of truth. Whatever, therefore, you do, be true to yourselves and to the world. Hide not your thoughts. If it is shameful to reveal them, it is more shameful to think them.

 [April 18, 1937]libtech_236_footnote
 Do you know that from today youlibtech_237_footnotehave become dwijas? What does the word dwija mean? It means twice-born. Today you have taken a new birth, so you have acquired knowledge today of which you were ignorant so far. The shastri has told you that you are now worthy of studying the Vedas. That, of course, you will do, but the
 
 
 fuller meaning of “studying of the Vedas” is a life in conformity with dharma. So far your life was devoid of the consciousness of dharma and adharma but now you have acquired that consciousness. During a famine, the sage Vishwamitra stole meat out of hunger. Having done that, he had to perform many ceremonies before eating it. No meal can be taken without taking a bath and performing the sandhya. Hence he began these ceremonies. But, while in the middle of these activities, he realized how low he had fallen! He  had committed theft merely to appease his stomach, and that too of meat. He who was satisfied with fruit and vegetables and had reached the vanaprastha stage of his life had coveted meat!These thoughts made him aware of his dharma. He took the piece of meat back to the butcher from whom he had stolen it and begged forgiveness. The latter was embarrassed at the sage seeking his forgiveness and said, “King among sages, this shop is yours, satisfy your hunger as much as you wish.” This made a deep impression  on the  sage.  He  told  the butcher that as from that day the latter was his guru. There follows a long conversation between the two which is narrated in the Mahabharata. However, it is irrelevant for your purpose. I narrated this story to you so that you would get an idea of what religious life is like. You have already taken a vow to keep your thoughts pure for twelve years and study while observing brahmacharya, but as from today you have begun thinking from the standpoint of dharma. You should not make the mistakes you have been making in the past as you have a new birth now. And, before you do anything you shall ask yourself whether what you are doing is right or wrong. The sacred thread is useful from this standpoint. Otherwise, there is no need to believe that dwija means a Brahmin. A Brahmin is one who has awareness of Brahman. If, after receiving the sacred thread, we do not take a new birth, if we do not begin a life in accordance with dharma, it makes little difference whether we wear it or not. I do not ask anyone to wear the sacred thread, as it has become a mere outward ceremony. But those who wish to imbibe consciousness of dharma from the ceremony may well wear the sacred thread.

  	I hope you got my letter[s] from Poona and Hudli. From the night of 	17th we have been having continuous rain. The camp was not 	constructed for rains. We have been obliged to shift where there is 	cover. Therefore we are overcrowded. And yet there is no sign of 	rain stopping.  	It is a pity Munnalal should have fever again. I hope you are having 	the papers and the post regularly. Love.

 CHI. MUNNALAL,
 You have again fallen ill. How is that? You ought not to [impair] your health . . . You must give up . . . for a long time. That means you should not take wheat. Fruit . . . Live on milk, curds . . . You can eat dates. Do not overexert yourself. Go to bed at 9 p.m. Drink boiled water. You must learn the art of not falling ill.
 Blessings from

  	Dwarkadas seems to have committed some mistake in the diet. I would 	prefer that he should go to Rajkot. But it would be equally good if 	he came to Wardha.

     DEAR 	C. R.,  April 	20, 1937 "
174,"April 	20, 1937","SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETING, HUDLI-III","
  	Personally I think it is better to ignore Rajah’s letter. But you 	may take notice of it, if you think it necessary in the public 	interest. No time for more as the bell for attending morning prayer 	has gone. Love.  BAPU  SHRI 	C. RAJAGOPALACHARI 	49 F AZALULLAH 	ROAD. 	TYAGARAYA 	NAGAR 	MADRAS  From 	a photostat: G.N. 2061         April 	20, 1937  	For today you may consider me the President. For I shall have to do 	most of the talking particularly on the subject of Kishorelal’slibtech_240_footnoteintended resignation. He insists on resigning as 	President. I do not like it. I had no suspicion at all of his 	intention to resign. There is something in it which is contrary to 	dharma. He came to see me in the morning. That is why I have been 	late by a few minutes. In the course of our talk I asked him a few 	questions. From his answers I could only conclude that what he 	intends to do is contrary to dharma. It is impossible of course that 	Kishorelal should deliberately do anything which is contrary to 	dharma. He is a godfearing man. But even godfearing men sometimes do 	things, albeit unknowingly, which are contrary to dharma. I say this 	from my own experience as well as that of others. The intention 	always is to pursue dharma. The effect is violation of it. If 	Kishorelal persists in his intention to resign there is going to be 	a violation of dharma. I can cite many instances of the kind, only I 	do not wish to take up your time. I did not of course wish to press 	Kishorelal. I did question him thoroughly. From his own answers I 	could see that his resgination would bring no good either to  
 the Sangh or to him personally. He himself is the best judge of his dharma. I cannot presume to judge for him. My duty is merely to help him in what he may consider his dharma. I would have done so in such a situation. But he was not able to say definitely that that was his dharma.
 Gomati was with him. I have respect for her intelligence. I inquired from her. She could not say much, except that Kishorelal had been distressed during the last two days. In my opinion this was not a sufficient reason. It would not justify my telling Kishorelal to do as he contemplated. Then I sent for Nathjilibtech_241_footnote. He is very intimate with Kishorelal. Kishorelal has great respect for him. I knew that in case of doubt Kishorelal would seek his advice. I also know him well. I asked him. I saw that he was inclined to agree with me. He told me he would have a talk with Kishorelal. I had no intention of making use of Nathji’s influence with him. If both Kishorelal and Gomati clearly felt that it was Kishorelal’s dharma to resign I would ask you to let him go. But Nathji told me that he could not say anything in the matter and that I should order Kishorelal. Well, generally I do not like to order even children. But sometimes I order even old men. I agreed to do so. I told Kishorelal that he could not leave at this juncture. It will not distress Kishorelal to obey because he is conscious of dharma. He has agreed.
 I have told you this because you must know. It is now for you and for me to remove the doubt that assails him. We are votaries of truth and non-violence. None of course can boast of fully pursuing truth and non-violence. To boast of any such thing would be conceit. But while we may not boast we have a right to try. Kishorelal fears we are giving up truth and non-violence. The parliamentary programme has created an enthusiasm amongst us. We have come to feel that swaraj will be more quickly obtained through  that programme. Therefore the question of the means employed ceases  to  be considered. The brute in man is awakened. I concede that this possibility is there in our accepting the programme. And it is  of course agreed that there is a good deal of the brute in man. Externally God has made us quite different from animals–for instance, we have hands which animals do not have. But the inner distinction is of much greater importance. A sign of this inner distinction is man’s ability to judge between the essential and the inessential. The brute in us will show itself in any case. May be, in the Councils programme there are greater chances for the brute to manifest itself. But we have been born as men, which will be justified if we subdue the beast. We have to
 
 bring out through our conduct the distinction between us and the animals. In this lies our humanness. It is not godliness. I know the Councils programme is such that we may indulge in abusing the British. We may deliver harsh-worded speeches. There is a lot of room for conceit, too. We have to keep away from all this. So we have to have a man who has an awareness of this. That is why we made Kishorelal our President. Gandhi Seva Sangh’s  work  cannot  be carried on with money. If it could, we would have proposed Jamnalalji as our President and he would have agreed. But he told us to look for  a fitter person and withdrew. If Jamnalalji collects a crore of rupees for the Sangh it will not benefit the Sangh, it will only harm it. Kishorelaldoes not have a pice he can call his own. He was considered fit to be the President.
 Kishorelal’s argument is that the parliamentary programme is full of temptations. But is that any reason why we should keep away from it? Should we not face the temptations? Kishorelal answers that so far we have remained untouched by temptations, that even today we look upon the things with suspicion. Then there are a number of important things to do. Under the circumstances, why should we unnecessarily take upon ourselves this botheration? I say you are going at my instance. The responsibility is mine. So far we have not gone. But can anyone say our hearts, too, were untouched? From the point of view of truth and non-violence, it can be dharma to accept something that we had earlier rejected. Our dharma is not one-sided. So much for Kishorelal’s doubts. Then he also says that the language of the resolutions of the Congress these days does not give expression to truth. This charge, too, is one-sided. He who proposes a resolution expresses his thoughts. The resolutions of the Congress also express the truth as the Congress sees it. We smell untruth in them. The resolution says that we are going into the Councils to wreck the Constitution. How can we show consideration for what we intend to destroy? Before 1920 the feeling was: why look towards a thing which we do not wish to accept?
 Kishorelal feels that so far we had kept the flow of water  blocked and that now we are breaking the dyke, which must release the water. So long we had talked of boycotting Councils, schools, courts, etc., and of destroying them. Today we are speaking a  different language. There are others also who share this feeling. All this is being said with reference to the manifesto of the Congress. How can we consider the language of the manifesto? The manifesto is not that of Jawaharlal alone. Vallabhbhai, Rajendra Babu and I have our share in it. I have not forgotten it. I read it over two or three times. It is not contradicted by the Congress resolution concerning acceptance
 of office. The practical part of that resolution has been drafted by me. Jawaharlal thought that it was not in conformity with the remaining three-fourths of the resolution and with the manifesto. He interprets the manifesto in one way, I in another. I see nothing wrong in it. The language is open to two different interpretations; of this there is no doubt. But a satyagrahi can use language which may be interpreted in two different ways. Truth, as I know it, does not demand that the words a satyagrahi utters should have only one meaning. What he says may have not two but several different meanings. The condition merely is that the meaning should not be hidden, words should not be used for deception and should be necessary [to convey the meaning]. The intention in using the language should not be to hide truth. When we frankly speak a language admitting two interpretations, we are not giving up truth. Sometimes it also happens that we intend only one meaning but those who hear us read two meanings in what we say. Here also truth is not violated. An outstanding instance is the Vedas. The Gita also has two meanings: one spiritual, the other material. There are also various other meanings. We cannot say the language of Tulsidas has only one meaning. So many meanings are read in his language that poor Tulsidas would never have imagined. But this does not prove either the authors or their commentators false. The language of the servant of truth does not always yield only one meaning.
 There is nothing to fear if in the same resolution Jawaharlal reads one meaning and I another. I have told him that his own interpretation may not necessarily be true. I had a discussion with him on the subject of office acceptance. The resolution was an independent document. Jawaharlal’s contention was that it was not in conformity with the background of the manifestolibtech_242_footnote. I told him that if he so desired I could make it conform to it. For when I say that I shall wreck the Constitution I mean I shall wreck it through non- violence. Please remember this condition of mine. I can bring about freedom by remaining inside it. If we have courage and independence of spirit, we can wreck the Constitution through non-violence. Jawaharlal does not think it is possible though he would of course be happy if this could be done. He mistrusts the human race a little. He says we would not be able to do anything there. He therefore places his faith in class struggle. This is the fundamental difference between him and me.
I say capital is insentient but the capitalist is not so. It is possible
 
 to change his heart. He says this has never happened before.  He quotes instances from history in support of his contention. I hear what he says. But my contention is, if it is not possible through non- violence to do what has not been done so far, which is the other power with which it can be done? If it cannot be done, then non-violence loses all significance. Never till I die can I accept this–provided of course I retain my ideas till I die. Today it is my firm conviction that non-violence will triumph. Even if we are all defeated non-violence will still triumph. I shall continue to say it until my last moment. Personally I would want to change the heart of the Government also. That is why we are going into the Councils. If I accept office it will be to gain swaraj. If we cannot secure office no harm will be done. I loose nothing. In either case I win. He who considers it improper to accept office with a view to wrecking the Constitution will naturally not accept office. But if we come pledging ourselves to truth, non- violence, fearlessness and unselfishness and accept Ministerships on our own conditions, we can win the battle of swaraj and establish a constitution of our own making in place of the present one. Jawaharlal does not think so. There is no point in hiding the fact that he holds opinions which are different from mine.
 Obviously Rajendra Babu, Vallabhbhai, Rajaji and others are inclined in one way, Jawaharlal in another. Nevertheless we are all working together. It is certainly a matter of wonder. But it is a necessity. After all we have to live in the world. We have to work with patriots holding views different from our own. Therefore we have to work in a spirit of co-operation and compromise. For this we shall have to take the initiative. There is no doubt that Jawaharlal is inclined to be rash. He says harsh things. Sometimes he calls people names. But he knows the worth of his colleagues. He understands discipline and restraint. Jawaharlal works with his colleagues in the belief that one day he will convert them to his view and he hopes that his contact with them will one day change their opinions. Three ideologies have thus been in conflict in the Congress. Even when I was in the Working Committee there was this conflict between two or three ideologies. I purposely made Vithalbhai the secretary. Even so the drafting of the resolutions always had to be done by me. They always admitted of two interpretations. I saw no objection to this because I have to carry the others with me. Truth and non-violence are the creed of the Congress. Still no one has accepted them as their creed. Those who have accepted them as a creed belong to this Sangh. Having admitted that we have so far pursued truth and non-violence, Kishorelal asks, supposing we adopt policies in future which would mean giving up of truth and non-violence in practice, then? I say to him, “In that case
 your leaving the Sangh will not help. In that case you will have to wind up the Sangh, you will have to bury it. You must then say that neither you nor anyone else can run the Sangh.”
 He asks me, “Who is he to say this.” I tell him that it is his right. He is the chief of the Sangh. It is therefore also his duty. If the members of the Sangh practise untruth and violence, he will then have to say that it should be wound up. Others may persist in continuing the Sangh. But in that case it will have ceased to be a body wedded to truth and non-violence. I do not say this without deliberation. I have thought a good deal over the matter. I have ordered Kishorelal to continue at his post. He has agreed to stay and he is non sorry for it. This tale now ends here.
 Let me now explain the policy we have adopted on the Councils question. The resolution does not mean that all of you are now free to go to the Councils. We have only one programme–the constructive programme. Swaraj depends only upon this. You have to devote yourself only to this. I do not even dream, no one ever does, that we can secure swaraj through Legislative Assemblies. But if we can promote the constructive programme even with the help of Legislative Assemblies, why should we not do so? We shall certainly further the constructive programme through these bodies. We shall also work outside. Then we shall certainly secure swaraj.
 Jawaharlal believes that we can fight the Government there.  Fight we certainly can and fight we may. But we shall not sacrifice truth and non-violence even one whit. We have to prepare for civil disobedience. Jawaharlal also says that we have to prepare for civil disobedience. But he does not consider non-violence the only means. To him non-violence is not the supreme dharma. If for the sake of the freedom of India he feels compelled to cut the throats of Englishmen, he will not hesitate. But he will do it openly, not in a clandestine manner.
 This is not my policy. I have given the sovereign place to non- violence. Swaraj coming through violence will be no swaraj for me. I shall therefore never agree to it.You also share my view. To Jawaharlal violence may well not be dispensable, but if swaraj could be gained through non-violence he would be happy. He, therefore, co-operates with me in my experiments. We are adopting a new policy. We are going into the Councils to strengthen the old policy. We are there to break the walls. What will happen if, in the name of the three crores of voters, other people go into the Councils and say that they do not want the charkha? I say that you have to go to Councils to further the cause of the charkha. You go there as the representatives  of the  people. You will say that the charkha had been going on even before.
 It is true, but it has been going on without thought. If we had plied the charkha knowing its implications, we should have secured swaraj by now, and it would not have been necessary for us to go  to  the Councils. Let us ply the charkha with knowledge. I again affirm what I had said in 1920 that if we ply the charkha with knowledge, swaraj is in our hands. You will say that I make statements which have no meanings. I do say things which have many meanings. Here, too, the charkha has to be given a wide interpretation. I still say that if the whole country plies the charkha with deliberation we shall not have so much as to mention the Councils. Today that is not so.
 Today we must come into close contact with the representatives of the three crores of voters. We must take from them as much as we can. Why should we not ? It does not mean that all of us should go to the Councils or that all those who wish to go should be permitted to do so. We shall inquire fully into the merits of each case. We shall also need a parlimentary committee. It must have both Rajendra Babu and Vallabhbhai on it. This means that we are not opening the doors of the Legislatures for all the members of the Sangh. Nor are we opening the doors of the Sangh. We are opening the doors of the Legislatures only for those who have pledged themselves to the constructive programme and without whom the Congress risks loosing seats. Let us leave Kishorelal to decide the matter. No one else can decide this.
 If tomorrow Satyamurti asks me if I would admit him into the Sangh, I shall say no. .My relations with Satyamurti are excellent. Sometimes out of consideration for me he lets his daughter ply a charkha. But he does not believe in the charkha and he cannot be a member of the Sangh, however much help he may render us. This is by way of an instance. This shows that we have not opened our doors to everyone. We have opened the doors for our own  people. Supposing we want that Jethalal should not go, shall we give up the Anantpur seat? If Dr. Khare says that he has to be sent, I may say that he is an uncouth person, that he does not know anything beyond the charkha, cannot even speak properly. But if nevertheless Dr. Khare insists on Jethalal being sent, I shall say to Jethalal: ‘Please go and ply your charkha there. At least one votary of Charkha was found necessary there. I am glad of it. If everyone going there believes in the charkha, the effectiveness of the charkha will increase.’
 Let us therefore try and see that everyone going there should be a votary of the charkha. But we must not appease the people. We must not flatter them. Such people have gone. Sardar tells me that if Dr. Gopichand had not gone, we would have lost the seat. There have been several such people. If it has not been the case everywhere it is a
 
 matter of shame. If everywhere we can send representatives of the charkha and the villagers, we should do so. You will become really capable when you develop for your work a thousand times the love that you feel for it today. Then you will not go on your own but under popular pressure. If you have a socialist rival he will withdraw in your favour. Only then is there any point in your going. If the socialist has a chance of going and he does not see any need for you to go, you should let him.
 I do not wish to cause mutual quarrels. I am one who left the Congress in order to avoid quarrels. When I was in the Congress I said I wanted Kelkar. I had sufficient faith in my own skill to feel that he would do the least harm if he worked with me. I want that it should be made impossible for anyone else to go except those who have faith in the charkha. If Vallabhbhai gives up the charkha, he will no longer remain the Sardar of Gujarat. And if in that case he fights the election on his own and wins, it would be a matter of shame for the Sangh, it would be a matter of shame for Bardoli, a matter of  shame  for Gujarat. It would also be a matter of shame for us. Whom then shall we send? One is told that the charkhawalas have no intellect. This is true to some extent. If we ply the charkha like automatons, it is no discipline.
 There is the story of Ekalavya in the Mahabharata. Think over it. It is not mere poetry. There is truth in it. Clay is not sentient and an image has no strength, but for Ekalavya, the image of Dronacharya was not clay. He saw in it Guru Dronacharya himself. How could his indomitable faith fail? If we have such a faith in the charkha, it can become for us a living image. We can then put into it all our resolve. The charkha is for us a symbol of ahimsa. The real thing here is not the image, but our attitude towards it. In one sense the world is real, in another God alone is the one thing real. Both are true in different ways. If we can see God in our symbol it represents truth for us. Non- violence is not for fools. We will have to use our intelligence. Non- violence has place both for knowledge and action, that is, both forthe intellect and the organs of the body. Today these are used for the destruction of non-violence. What we want is that these should become hand-maidens of non-violence. Only when we make the organs of our body hand-maidens of non-violence will they acquire strength. If non-violence cannot be effective in this field, where else can it be so? I shall not leave any field out of fear. If I leave any field fearing that non-violence will be of no use, then there can be no such thing as non-violence. And what field shall I give up? My body will continue to function, the organs of the body will continue to be active. I do not
 wish to commit suicide. I shall not block my ears and my nose. What then shall I do? There is only one way open to me and that is to make all the limbs of my body hand-maidens of non-violence.
 The other method was tried by Kishorelal. That was many years ago. He went into solitude to discipline himself. When a train whistled past, it broke his solitude. One day when I went to him on my usual visit, he told me that the whistling of the train troubled him and that he was thinking of plugging his ears with cottonwool or rubber. I told him to try that method also. But it was only an external aid. He was not able to concentrate on God, so he heard the sound of the whistle. Kishorelal himself saw this and so when the next day I told him to put cottonwool or rubber into his ears he said that that was no longer necessary. We have ears but they are not for misuse. The same is true of the other organs. The organs are there to sustain the body. Our mouth eats to nourish the body. If we eat for the pleasure of the palate we shall not be pursuing non-violence.
 Even if someone forcibly sends us to the Councils we shall have our own views. Kishorelal fears once we go there we shall forget all our ideas. I share his fear. But why should I shirk because of it? If you do not have a living faith in the charkha and the rest of the constructive programme of the Congress, the fears of Kishorelal will prove true. But I have faith in you. If I did not have it, I would not have come here. Why should I distrust you? I have frankly told you everything. There is here no departure from policy. Last evening the language used was different but that is the way with language. Language acquires lucidity in the course of work. There is no doubt that harmony of thought, word and deed is the sign of truth. But ideas advance and language is left behind. I wondered why I was not able to convince Kishorelal. My language was vague. I listened to the discussion and my ideas became clear. But the language did not
 become clear. When I meditate after giving thought to a matter my language becomes clearer and clearer each day. But I have not yet had time for this.
 In accepting the Councils programme we are not getting away from non-violence. In taking this step, I am making you advance two steps in the direction of non-violence. If you can understand them and act accordingly you shall during this year make progress such as you have never been able to make before. The time has come when India must choose either this way or that. It seems to me that at this juncture you cannot keep yourselves shut up in a room. It is yet to be shown whether as a nation we are moving towards truth and non- violence or not. It would be cowardice for you to turn away from three crores of voters. Even if we have truth and non-violence on our
 
 tongues and something else in our hearts, what I have said will bear fruit. If you are not hypocrites you will go to the Assemblies with full faith in non-violence and advance towards the goal. If you prove to be hypocrites it will not distress me. It would do us good if hypocrisy is exposed. When life leaves the body we burn it, even though it be that of a person as dear as a father, and we cast the ashes in the Ganga. If the soul of the Sangh, which is truth and non-violence, leaves it, it will be the duty of Kishorelal to consign it to the flames. The Sangh will get vigour only if it is a living thing. If even today it has no life in it we are all hypocrites and it will be no use for the Sangh to continue to exist.
 Shastris tell me that truth and non-violence are subtle things. They ask how one can form organizations out of abstract things. I assert that truth and non-violence can be organized. If non-violence cannot be organized, it is not a dharma. If there is anything special about me, it is only this, that I am organizing truth and non-violence. Otherwise they will cease to be the eternal verities that they are to me. To me truth and non-violence are not unreal things and if they cannot become our collective dharma they are false. What I want to do and want to die after doing, is to organize non-violence. And if it is not valid in every field it is false. I assert that in every walk of life, non- violence has its use. I speak the language of the Jains. They say that the rule should admit of no exception. This is also the language of geometry. A right angle must have 90 degrees. If there is any sphere of life in which non-violence is ineffective it is false. Please remember this. If you all take the opposite path and give up the charkha and non-violence, I will say that you never had faith in truth and non- vilence. Believe it that though it may be without your knowing it, you were all votaries of violence., I do not condemn you. You have come to the Sangh after careful thought and in  the  name  of  truth.Remember that truth and non-violence are not for  hermits. These eternal principles apply in courts, legislatures and other spheres of human endeavour. Your faith is going to be put to a severe test. Do not run away in fright.
 You are being given today a difficult question paper. Neither you nor I know whether you will pass or not. Even so, why should I fear ? I do not want to render you impotent and stupid. Truth and non-violence are not for the stupid. Why cannot Kanti, Bal, Tansukhlibtech_243_footnoteand others develop their minds by plying the charkha? Why do they have to go the the college ? If those of us who ply the charkha cannot show the intelligence that Kanti, Bal and Tansukh do, I shall say that
 
 we should also go to colleges. But in truth in Kanti and others there has not been a development of the intellect, only a play of intellect. The inquiry into our pursuit of truth and non-violence makes for development of the intellect. If they do not, then either they or we are false. Since it is impossible for truth and non-violence to be false, we ourselves are proved to be false.
 The whole of the constructive programme is a reasearch into us.  I continue to ply the charkha. I am now 69 years of age. Therefore it cannot be said that my intellect is not developing. What I am saying, I say deliberately and in full command of myself. Bal, Kanti and Tansukh are not developing their intellects by going to colleges. You may say that even those who work do not develop their intellects. The reason is that they work like automatons. My intellect will continue to develop till the moment I die. The charkha is also the prop for my intellect but it does not stray into wrong paths. I have no time to see, hear or read pleasurable things. I discover Daridranarayana through the charkha and have vision of God. This is the way my intellect has been developing and will continue to develop all my life. The testing of a man is not complete till he dies. If at the moment of death a man’s intellect does not retain its brilliance I will say that he has not succeeded.
 There is no rule that the intellect of those who ply the charkha cannot shine. Only you should do it intelligently. If you work as a carpenter, you must develop the science of carpentry. Today I am formulating some stiff questions for the science of the charkha. Because it absorbs all my faculties when I am immersed  in  the charkha I am in a state of bliss. I am not yet able to say where the limits of the constructive programme lie. The instance of the clay image shows only this. In the constructive programme we have all- round development. The charkha is a mantra. When I see those who ply the charkha discouraged, I am baffled. Why is it that they are lacking in spiritual development?
 What I am telling you concerns eternal truth, because I am able to experience it. If I have gone to settle in Segaon it is not because I feel frustrated. When the call comes I will even say that I shall not budge from Segaon. I do not work there like a machine. Truth and non-violence develop the body, the intellect and the spirit. If there is not all-round development of all our faculties through truth and non- violence we are hypocrites. What service I have rendered ever since 1920 has been only through the charkha, though Hindu-Muslim unity and through the campaign for eradication of untouchability. I have always said that these reflect truth and non-violence. These were the shortest path to their discovery.
 Going into Legislatures is also a means towards approaching truth and non-violence. Otherwise Parliament for us is taboo. That can be the only reason and there is no other for any interest we may have in the Councils programme. Truth and non-violence are ends as well as means. If good and truthful men go into the Legislatures, those institutions can also become an effective means to furthering truth and non-violence. If this does not happen the failure will be ours and not theirs. It will only mean that our intellects have not developed. So much for the Councils programme.
 Now I take Balubhai’s question. The substance of the questions is whether we should go to the villages to serve or for political awakening. I find it somewhat strange that after seventeen years of effort in furtherance of this programme such a question should be asked. To me there is no political education apart from the constructive programme. Our aim is merely the propagation of the charkha and such other things. This does not mean that we do not wish to give the villagers political education. But there is no such thing as political education by itself. We should keep in touch with them without harbouring any motive. We have to develop their strength. I go to them with the programme of eradication of untouchability and the like and give them education. Political education is just that. If I do something apart from this and go the the villagers seeking votes, I shall be doing exactly what we blame the missionaries for doing. I shall never talk to them about what is to my interest even if it should be intimately connected with the politics of the country. Constructive programme is thus in itself a political education. This is what I did in South Africa. There also the question before me was not of numbers. I never talked to the so-called coolies about  politics.  I  did not organize them from any political motive. The question of the £ 3 tax came later.
 The organization came in useful for the satyagraha battle later. During that battle I saw God face to face many times, so many times that even if I were a dunce I should not forget it. I had not hoped that the organization I was building would bring such large results. This is the way I conducted political education in South Africa. It was not the whole of South Africa, only the Transvaal. What I want to show is that the way I carried on the work of political education was by rendering silent, selfless service. The people among whom I worked came of their own accord and began to shout ‘Long live the Congress’. If the prestige that the South African Indian Congress today enjoys is not the result of political education, what else can it be? Hertzog is saying the same thing today.
I continued this policy on my return to India from South
 Africa. I worked in the Kheda district but did not so much as mention the Congress. I talked solely of land revenue. I worked among the labourers and did not mention the Congress. In Champaran again I did not work in the name of the Congress. My colleagues and I belonged to the Congress and that was enough, but when you go to Champaran today what do you see? Is the Congress anywhere else as strong today as it is in Champaran? On the strength of Champaran, Rajendra Babu rules Bihar today. But even today I would not talk about the Congress there. Knowledge is to be given where there is curiosity. Today they do not even have bread. What shall I gain by talking to them of things outside Champaran? What shall I gain by teaching them geography, or history, or politics? What shall I gain by talking to them about the problems of the whole country? Considering all things, I have come to the conclusion that we cannot give political education by trying to give such education. I  have showed you through various instances what may be called  real  political education. Political education is not something apart.
 In 1920 I made boycott an essential part of the political programme. I said: “Forget parliament, forget law courts, forget even educational instituutions.” People started saying that this man who has undertaken such terrible work is quite ridiculous. In 1920 I made the charkha the centre of politics. I made it a weapon for a battle. In Bardoli also it was made an essential part of civil disobedience. That is why the condition was laid down that the whole of Bardoli should adopt khadi inside of six months. This was the language of the Congress at that time. Vithalbhailibtech_244_footnotecajoled me. But what shall I say of my shame? What shall I say of Sardar’s shame? Even today Bardoli has not fulfilled the condition of the charkha. Prohibition has not been achieved nor has untouchability been eradicated. Today I would not launch a campaign on the strength of Bardoli. But this is my way of political education. If the Congress tries some other method it will not succeed. I am not saying this out of pride. It only shows how unshakable is my faith. If the Congress does not have faith in these things, why does it not give them up? I say with all the force I can command that if these things are bad or useless they should not be accepted out of consideration for Gandhi.
 Balubhai has passed M.A., L.L.B., but that does not mean that he remembers what he read of politics. And he is not the only one. We, all of us, educated people, have proved ineffective in giving political education to the people. Our English education has made us useless. The heritage left by out forefathers has been squandered. But
 
 I must tell you that it is only through these things that political education can be carried on. It is not something separate. If it is our conviction that the charkha in itself constitutes political education we shall not get tired or accept defeat. If socialists come let them. They are my friends. They do not quarrel with me and I do not wish to quarrel with them. They want to conduct political education by a different method. Their means and mine differ. But our goal is the same. I put the same programme before them, too. I also say that all land belongs to God. But merely on the basis of this the socialists cannot claim all land as their property. I cannot  today  advocate talking away land from those who own it. I too want that we should all be possessors of Jamnalalji’s wealth, but all the 30 crores of our people, not I alone. All land belongs to God, that is, to the people. But doesn’t this mean that Jamnalalji’s land should be partitioned in 30 crores little bits? How are these 30 crores to become owners of the land? Who should make them owners or make themselves the owners on their behalf is the question. Someone has to come forward as their representative. Therefore if Jamnalalji becomes our trustee and remembers that this wealth belongs to 30 crores of people, what is the harm? He has given me all the Sevagram land. But I cannot take it, for   I am a fool. I do not understand these things. His  manager understands them better than I. Today I take all the profit, he takes all the loss. If you want to make use of the wealth of rich men like Jamnalalji and Rameshwardas Birla, make use of my talent. I cannot derive much profit from the Segaon property because I have neither men nor the intelligence. I do not want even a cowrie from outside Segaon. I have all the means; only I have been slack. Today if I build  a house he has to pay for it. This is hundred per cent true. I grab as much as I can digest. What more can I ask from any rich man? Come,  I invite you to go to some other village of Jamnalalji and settle there in the way I have settled in Seagon. But the man should be one approved by me and willing to carry out my programme. This however is an entirely different matter. My subject was the charkha.
 There was a time when C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar thought that the charkha was a political weapon. Mohammed Ali called it our gun,
Khadilkar cited a verse from the Gita.libtech_245_footnote
 “Here no effort undertaken is lost, no disaster befalls.” Even better than this is the second half: “Even a little of this righteous course delivers one from great fear.”
 I do not regret my friendship with Mohammed Ali. He was an honest and godfearing man. He used to say what he considered moral
 
 and true at that time. Yet he also said that in the path of God it is permissible for us to take up the sword and even to utter falsehoods. But people of all religions say this. Among Christians also there is no restriction. The sanatanists say it openly, and even cite a verse from Manusmriti as authotity, that uttering of untruth is permissible for saving a cow, when talking to women and on such occasions as marriage, etc. Even adharma becomes established in the name of dharma. But it shows the majesty of dharma. Sanatanists tell me that I am a heretic, that I know nothing of dharma and adharma, that my truth is more harmful than untruth. This shows how far adharma can go in the name of dharma.
 It is true that we go to the villages to impart political education to the people. But as I am trying to say, the way of political education is the furthering of constructive programme. We should not even utter the word ‘political’ among the people. The same applies to dharma. We should not even mention the word ‘dharma’. Tell them simply to clean their lavatories well and to bathe. But dharma is beyond their comprehension. This is not a result of their inferiority but of our littleness. I hesitate to talk to them about truth and non-violence. We have kept them suppressed. I can only talk to them about the way they should conduct themselves. How can I speak to them about brahmacharya. They cannot even pronounce the word. When they pronounce it as bharamcharlibtech_246_footnoteand cannot even understand it, it is bharamchar for them. I want to understand their morals. I want to win their confidence. If one of them comes to me and says  he  has relations with his sister-in-law how can I condemn him? The sin is on our heads. I want to teach them bit by bit without mentioning truth and non-violence. I know no other way.
 If we want non-violent swaraj it can come only thus and here no one can oppose us, whether it be England or America. The question that Balubhai now asks was answered by me 17 years ago. In 1920 everyone was mad about the charkha—Motilalji, Mohammed Ali, Shaukat Ali, Abbas Tyabji and others. Everyone had started spinning. Everyone thought that nothing was to be gained through Parliament. Today I have become much more tolerant, so that I can even permit people going into Parliament. This is a well-tried method of giving political education. This is the way people can be trained. If Segaon tomorrow becomes self-sufficient, if people keep the village clean, do not covet even a pie of another’s, what more will be lacking for their freedom? They will say: ‘Who is Jamnalal Sheth? We till the land and it is ours. The land was there before Jamnalalji was born. We shall not
 
 be frightened. We shall not resort to hooliganism. If Jamnalalji’s manager comes we shall not assault him. We shall simply remove him from our land.’ These things will have to be taught to them. Granted that people are the real owners of the land. But how am I to get it accepted? There are only two ways. Force and persuasion. The way of persuasion is the way of dharma. If you cannot adopt it, then what Kishorelal says is true. Then the socialists will prove that they had been in the right. Then I shall have to tell you to follow them. They also stand for the good of the people. If they cannot influence the people it would be a matter of shame to me. But you came into the field of service before they did. You have also worked very hard. If you cannot influence people it would be a matter of greater shame to me.
 But how is this to be done? Merely repeating ‘constructive programme’ like a parrot will not do. Your programme is more vigorous than that of the Spinners’ Association. In the Spinners’ Association there are some people who fulfil the tasks allotted to  them. But among you there are those who have intelligently and thoughtfully developed it into a science. The spheres of work of the Spinners’ Association and the Village Industries Association are limited. The same is true of bodies like Goseva Sangh. Your sphere of work is wider. The Gandhi Seva Sangh is a large organization. It is not a rival of the Congress. The Congress too is a large organization. But it has been built by the people. It reflects the strength as well as the weakness of the people. But your organization is voluntary. It is a coming together of those who have undertaken to fulfil the entire programme issuing from truth and non-violence. It is a mighty tree of which Spinners’ Association and Village Industries Association are branches. The Sangh is indicative of your strength. Or should I say the power of truth and non-violence will find expression through it? Jamnalalji may well have built it up, but it is not his organization. He himself became only an ordinary member and said that he would never become an office-bearer. This shows not only his humility but also his wisdom.
 We want to bring about an all-round advancement of India through what we call constructive work. There are various organizations which have taken up each a separate item of the programme. Your work should be an example to them. Today one cannot say it is. We must, therefore, very clearly declare that our work is constructive work and that we are going into Parliament for furthering that work.
 If what I have said has not satisfied you entirely, the reason can only be that I have not been able to couch my language in legalistic
 phraseology. But it is clearer than day before yesterday. My language is imperfect. The language of one who is himself imperfect must be imperfect, too. If after 17 years of explaining I have not been able to explain myself, then I am imperfect and so are you who cannot understand. Thakkar has sent me a letter. It is an interesting letter worth reading out. I have not the time but I must read out to you just one sentence from this letter. He says: “Last year I had to be in Dhulia itself and I may have to live there in future, too, but my faith in village work has not diminished one jot and no desire has arisen in me for life in a city.”
 The workers who have not wholly given up the love for city life have had their faith in the charkha somewhat slackened. This gives rise to doubts. To me the charkha is everything. I am living in a village and devote most of my time to the charkha. About political matters I merely offer advice and then forget about it. I do my writing for the constructive programme and for it I work. I do not despair though the members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh have not been doing their work with full awakening. The charkha work does not end with giving women two pice or two annas. If through the charkha we  cannot develop our minds, then we should let it go. It is my faith that the charkha will bring us swaraj. Kishorelal seems to fear that you have accepted the charkha for my sake and that you will give it up when I am no more. He therefore wants to keep you away from temptations.
 Even if I should be the only one with faith in the charkha, I shall be proud to die working for it. My pride while plying the charkha or serving the Harijans will be pardonable. After all we have to commune with God through some means or other. Why not then through the charkha? You may say that I have worked for the charkha or that the charkha has worked for me. If the devotee is the slave of God, God also is the slave of the devotee’s slave. It is in this sense I am speaking  to you. If we cannot create an atmosphere in which the charkha can bring about the development of the mind, Kanti and Bal have no alternative but to go to the college. They do not have the originality of Ekalavya. If you understand what I am trying to say, there will be no reason for you to be in two minds. The main thing is concentration–one-pointedness of attention. Kishorelal prepared his speech with such concentration as if it was meant for the entire world.  I was witness to it. To him the Sangh is the whole world. He also prepared a summary of it for your convenience. He works without attachment. He is another Yudhishthira, which I am not. I shall be happy if I can acquire the strength of even a Bhima or an Arjuna. People call me a karmayogi. I do not know whether I am a karmayogi
 
 or any other yogi, but I cannot live without work–this I know. When something sinks into my heart, I cannot be at peace till I have put it into practice. People may say I am mad in saying that I wish to die with the charkha in my hand. I do not wish to die holding a string of beads. For concentration the charkha is my beads. God appears to me in thousands of forms. Sometimes I see him in the charkha, sometimes in Hindu-Muslim unity, sometimes in the eradication  of untouchability. I move as my feeling draws me. When I wish to   enter  a room in an institution, I do so and I feel there the presence of God. In the Gita God has said that He looks to the well-being of those who worship Him. You must be firm in this faith if you have understood me.

 Gandhi Seva Sanghke Tritiya Varshik Adhiveshan (Hudli, Karnatak) ka Vivaran, pp. 54-67
 "
175,"April 20, 1937","SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETING, HUDLI-IV","
    
 HUDLI,
 April 20, 1937
Let me now come to Mama’s proposal. The proposal is:
 Since it is the aim of the Sangh to look upon the constructive programme of the Indian National Congress as a dharma and make it a success, in a programme like the removal of untouchability it is the duty of the members of the Sangh to come into direct contact with sweepers and other Harijan brethren and convince them as well as others that they make no distinctions in their treatment of  the  Harijans. Let them give a place to Harijans in their homes, receive Harijans in the same way as they would receive others, seek opportunities to eat with them. Let them keep some Harijan members in their houses, bring up some Harijan children, go to the Harijan colonies and serve them in various ways and lovingly participate in their work and prove thereby that none of the jobs the Harijans have to do is lowly.
 VALLABHBHAI PATEL: This proposal justifies the fear of the sanatanists.
 From removal of untouchability you want to proceed step by step to intermarriage. (Laughter)
 GANDHIJI: For ordinary people, removal of untouchability is sufficient. But, for you, mere touch is not enough. You must continue to proceed further. Your field of progress is unlimited. Ordinary people can look up only to the sky. But scientists claim that they can
 look through the whole expanse of the milky way. It is not known if something exists beyond that. But truth pierces through the sky and reaches beyond. We have to imbibe truth in our lives. We find that under the guise of truth, untruth is being respected by people. It is the aim of religion to strengthen the idea of brotherhood, to minimize the unnatural distinctions between man and man. But today, in the very name of religion, the Harijans are being treated with contempt. I have already said that untruth, by itself, is powerless, it is dependent. It can never stand on its own without the support of truth. But I wish to point out to you that if untruth can succeed so much in the name of truth, how much more would truth itself succeed? Who can measure the extent of its success?
 For us, who are the members of the Sangh, there should be no place for any unjust distinctions in our hearts. It may seem strange, but as far as I am concerned, such a feeling of distinction disappeared from the day I ate a bit of mutton with a Muslim boy.libtech_247_footnoteEating mutton was and is a bad thing. But this small thing saved me from something else as well. By tasting a little mutton I realized that there was nothing particularly to rave about it. That saved me in England and I did not betray my mother. I have not spoken to the millions about interdining and intermarriage. We do not have inter-dining and intermarriage even with Brahmins. My mother, while observing some pious vows, would not take food even from my hands. The Hindu masses still follow quite a few restrictive practices in the matter of inter-dining and intermarriage. Even I have followed certain restrictions in this regard. That is the reason why I have not spoken to the masses about these.
 But if I suggest to you that you should go to the extent of inter- dining and intermarrying with Harijans I would not be violating truth. Let me talk to you on a religious point. I am talking about religion as  a matter of day-to-day practice. It is not something related to any particular occasion. You have really not much control in the matter of intermarriage. You should certainly not bring compulsion on your children in this matter. Inter-dining is a different matter. If your mother says that it is irreligion, you must tell her that you would take the food cooked by her as well as the food cooked by an untouchable, and it would not matter that you were forsaken by her  on  that account. You cannot compel your mother or even your wife. We must have two separate establishments in such a situation. If wecannot exercise force over them, we cannot do it over religion either. In other words, we cannot coerce our own sons. Our mothers and wives may well consider it their duty to forsake us. Let us stay apart without
 
 
 being enemies of each other. In such a situation I would treat them more affectionately. I would try not to hurt their feelings. But at the same time I would not hurt the feelings of Harijans in order to please them. Only truth and Hinduism can teach me this. For me, religion, truth and Hinduism are inter-changeable terms. If there is an element of untruth in Hinduism, I cannot accept that particular aspect of Hinduism as religion. If, on this account, the entire Hindu community forsakes me and I am left all alone, I would still proclaim that I am not alone, they who forsake me are alone. For, truth is on my side. And truth is God Himself libtech_248_footnote
 I would accept the hospitality even from a leper. But the manner of acceptance would be different. I would tell him affectionately that he should allow me to cook the food and fetch the water. As far as I am personally concerned, for the sake of love, I would even take the food and the water offered by a leper if he really insists. I would be even willing to die for his love. But the whole world cannot accept his hospitality in this spirit. Hence, I too would accept it in the same manner that the entire society can accept. I  followed  the  same principle in the case of Parachure Shastri. But that is a different case. We should not confuse diesease with the issue of untouchability. They are two absolutely different problems. The question relating to the sweeper is altogether different from the question relating to the leper. We have an opportunity of teaching the sweeper habits of cleanliness if we come in greater contact with him. And, is it not also true that if any sweeper invites me or you for a meal he would himself be concerned about washing himself clean and donning clean clothes and offer us cleanly prepared food?
 Please do not confuse the issue of poverty with this. The problem of poverty is economic, whereas the problem of abolition of untouchability is religious or spiritual. My religion will not be destroyed if I do not solve the problem of poverty of a poor peasant. But if I allow the untouchability to persist even in the case  of  a wealthy Harijan, my religion will cease to exist. That is the reason why the begining of an act of service should be only with the Harijan.
 Then Gandhiji moved the following resolution pertaining to goseva.
 Economic and moral uplift of India is one of the aims of the Sangh and the protection of our cows is non-violence in its concrete from and it implies economic benefits to millions of people. That is why the attention of the members of the Sangh is being drawn towards goseva. It is the duty of
 
 
 
 
 
 the members of the Sangh to study animal husbandry as much as possible and try their utmost to protect our cows. The least they can do is to use cow’s milk and its products instead of buffalo’s milk, etc.,  as  far  as possible, and make cow’s milk and its products popular.
I am not laying any particular stress on this resolution today. If
 there is doubt in your mind and you wish to discuss it, we may as well abandon it. For, this is a novel thing. Its language is distinct from that of the Congress. The things Kishorelal mentioned in the course of his introductory speech are easy no doubt; but they cannot provide enough work. As the issue in this form concerns none but the Hindus, I did not bring this proposal before the Congress. This is an inseparable part of Hinduism. The sanatanists consider my way of goseva as a thing to be shunned and partonize goseva organizations. But this is their gross ignorance. I have described the popular practice of goseva as the devouring of cows. And, I have still not withdrawn my words. People are terribly angry with me on this account. But, even if they sever my head, I would say only what is truth. Our religion exhorts us first to protect the cow and then the Brahmin. Cow-protection is an inseparable part of our religion. But today we do not protect, but rather devour our cows. We should lay down our lives for the sake of the cow. But today we are allowing the cow to die for us. Hinduism generally regards suicide as a sin. But in certain situations, our religion not only permits but also exhorts us to resort to suicide. In view of this, we must kill ourselves if it is necessary in order to save the cow.
 All that this resolution lays down is that the members of the Sangh should insist on using only cow’s milk and ghee. It is not a question of taking a vow. Insisting on cow’s milk means that if it is necessary to take buffalo’s milk or ghee to save life, it should be taken. But if it is a vow, it leaves no such scope. If you wish, instead of saying “insist on using” you may say “as far as possible use” which would soften both the language and the sentiment. Tomorrow if I go to Dhotre’s house, I would insist and I must. I would do the same everywhere. For me “as far as possible” is a meaningless phrase.
 VALLABHBHAI PATEL: One who is ill or has to be always travelling, cannot even insist.
 GANDHIJI: In such a situation, insistence would include taking buffalo’s milk or ghee. Saying “as far as possible” is a different thing. It commits you to nothing. I look at it from the point of view of religion. And for me, service of religion and service of the country mean the same thing.
That is the responsibility of persons like Jamnalalji. I have got a
 
 ready-made plan for cow’s ghee.libtech_249_footnoteWhy can’t they throw away a couple of lakhs in that experiment?
 Discussing the next annual meeting of the Sangh and invitations from Bengal,
 U.P. and Utkal for this Gandhiji said:
 I am particularly partial to Orissa. We can also expect to raise larger funds there that at Hudli. But, in my view, it would not be proper to give travelling expenses. The members must attend the convention at their own expense. As for those who cannot spend their own money, Gopa Babu can collect the necessary sums to be given to them on the recommendation of the office. And, if even he cannot make such an arrangement, those members should not be invited. But under no circumstances should the Sangh give travelling expenses. Gopa Babu has agreed to all the conditions. There is one more reason. The Congress has done the least amount of work in Orissa. It is a miracle that the Congress has won a majority there. Only one of the Congress candidates was defeated there, and even that on my account. He was such a naive person that it was good for the Congress that he was defeated. The poor Oriyas are considered to be slack people. When they are giving an invitation, we must forget about Bihar and Bengal. I had followed the same principle in deciding in favour of Gujarat for the Congress. It was a tussle between Ras and Bardoli. I said that Ras had a stronger case and should give in. Hence the partiality to Bardoli even at the cost of hurting Ras.

 MY DEAR DR. JAWAHARLAL,
 Thank you very much for your detailed letter of the 14th. You are right in thinking that the recent attack of influenza had something to do with the extinction of life in the child. I suppose she will have to stay there for about a fortnight before she is in a condition to travel. How is it that there is no kitchen attached to the maternity hospital? Please remember me to Mrs. Jawaharlal who I hope is steadily improving.

178,"April 	22, 1937",INTERVIEW TO “THE HINDU “libtech_251_footnote,"
    DR. 	JAWAHARLAL, 	M.L.A. SWAROOP 	SADAN 	CAWNPORE  From 	a copy: Pyrelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         Yours sincerely,              POONA, 
  April 	22, 1937  CORRESPONDENT: 	You say you do not seek any the slightest abrogation of the 	Government of India Act. Do you not thereby mean that you do not 	want an immediate amendment but that you contemplate it at some 	time? GANDHIJI: 	 That is wholly a mistaken view. I want no amendment  	whatsoever, immediate or distant. For the Congress insists, so do I, 	on the complete repeal of the Act so that it might be substituted at 	the earliest possible moment by an Act of the people themselves. 	What I want, before Congressmen accept office, is an assurance which 	I still hold is within the power of the Governors to give, that they 	will not interfere with the day-to-day administration of the  	Province.  For, under the Act, it is not they but the Ministers who 	are responsible for the administration of the Province within the 	sphere prescribed by the    
 Act. All talk, therefore, of the constitutional inability of the Governors to give an assurance baffles me and makes me suspect the motives of the British politicians who have the working of the Act within their power.
 Do you mean that under no circumstances whatsoever can a Governor interfere if an emergency of a grave nature in his opinion arises?
 That is a fair question. I certainly do not mean any such thing. I can conceive of the possibility of a Minister making a stupid blunder, so as to harm the people in whose name he is acting. The Governor”s duty will then be plain. He would reason with the Ministers and if the Ministers do not listen, he will dismiss the Cabinet. The assurance contemplates non-interference, not non-dismissal. But dismissal when there is a clear majority in the Assembly would mean dissolution and fresh election. That will always be open to the Governor to precipitate, as it would be open to the Provincial Cabinet to do. But such a crisis cannot occur from day to day. What, therefore, I want is an absolutely honourable understanding which is incapable of a double interpretation by honourable parties.
 May I then take it that you would not mind such assurances being given even in Provinces where the Congress is not in a majority?
 So fat as I am concerned, not only would I not mind it as a confirmed democrat, I would not have for the Congress what may not be given to other parties where they enjoy a clear majority.
 I take it you are aware of the special responsibilities of the Governors.
I am afraid I must confess my ignorance.
 May I then tell you that they are responsible when there is a grave menace to peace and tranquillity or to the legitimate rights of the minorities or to Service rights, Indian States, etc.?
 But if the Governors are reponsible, Ministers who are worth their salt are surely still more responsible for peace and tranquillity, for the actual protection of the rights of the minorities, rights of the States–if by States is meant the people of the States as well as the Princes. I cannot imagine rights of Princes against the people within their jurisdiction. And even in all these, the pity of it is that the so- called autonomy has been boiled down so much by statue that the Governor’s discretion is extremely limited. There is one thing, however, if I were a Congress Minister I would not be willingly responsible for, as I would be for other things you have mentioned—I mean the rights of the Services. By that one guarantee, in my opinion, the framers of the Act have reduced autonomy to a farce. But under the assurance I have contemplated, I have not envisaged a reduction of those rights which are guaranteed by the Act itself. While the Act
 remains in force the Congress Ministers will take office knowing well the handicap under which they will labour from the very commencement of their career. I nevertheless feel  that,  if  the assurance contemplated by the Congress resolution is given, the Ministers can, in spite of the handicap, so consolidate their position that they can, even acting within the Constitution, compel the repeal of the Act and hasten the day of the meeting of the Constituent Assembly whose Act will be accepted by the British people—unless they want to govern India by the naked sword.

 Mahatma Gandhi said:
 I read it with respectful attention and so far as I am concerned I hope I have made my position so clear as to leave no room for any misunderstanding.

I cannot understand how Sir Shanmukham Chetty could have failed to dissuade the Maharaja from the action which seems to me to be indefensible even from the point of view of staunch sanatanists.

182,,CURSE OF DRINK,"
  	Your letters before me. Returned this morning. This will go to 	Simla.  	I have the prospectus, etc. That letter was over-weight  and  	carried a fine of two annas.  	It is so hot that we are melting. I am in no mood to write at 	length. Yes, 	I leave for Allahabad on 25th and return on 29th.  	The weather this time has been cruel in so many parts of India. What 	is this eczema again? Do you mean the same patches? Love.  Yours,  ROBBER  From 	the original: C.W. 3776. Courtesy: Amrit Kaur. Also G.N. 6932        A 	sister writes:  On 	going to 	the village, 	I was 	more than grieved 	to hear 	of the 	havoc drink 	is working 	among these people. Some of 	the women 	were in tears. 	What can they do? There 	is not a woman who would not like to banish alcohol for all 	time from out midst. 	It is the 	cause of 	so much domestic 	misery, poverty, ruined 	health and physique. 	As usual 	it is the 	woman who 	has to bear 	the burden 	of this self-indulgence on the part of man. What can I advise the 	women  to do? 	It is so hard 	to face 	anger and 	even cruelty. How 	I wish 	the leaders in 	this Province would 	concentrate on the 	removal of 	this evil rather than 	expend time, energy and brain on the injustice of the Communal Award. We are so apt 
 to neglect the things that really matter for such trivialities as would settle themselves if the moral stature of our people were raised. Can’t you write an appeal to the prople on the question of drink? It is sad to see these people literally going to perdition because of the curse.
 My appeal to those who drink will be vain. It must be. They never read Harijan. If they do, they do so to scoff. They can have no interest in being informed of the evil of the drink habit. They hug the very evil. But I would like to remind this sister, and through her all the women of India, that at the time of the Dandi march the women of India did listen to my advice and made the fight against drink and the plying of the wheel their speciality. Let the writer recall the fact that thousands of women fearlessly surrounded drink-shops and often successfully appealed to the addicts to give up the habit. In the prosecution of their self-imposed mission they put up with the abuses of the addicts and sometimes even assaults by them. Hundreds went to gaol for the crime of picketing drink-shops. Their zealous work produced a marvellous effect all over the country. But unfortunately with the cessation of civil disobedience, and even before the cessation, the work slackened. Into the reasons for the slackening I need not go. But the work still awaits workers. The women’s pledge remains unfulfilled. It was not taken for a definite period only. It could not be fulfilled until prohibition was proclaimed throughout India. The women’s was the nobler part. Theirs was to bring about prohibition by emptying drink-shops by an appeal to the best in man. Could they have continued the work, their gentleness combined with earnestness would most assuredly have weaned the drunkard from his habit.
 But nothing is lost. The women can still organize the campaign. If the wives of those of whom the writer writes are in earnest, they can surely convert their husbands. Women do not know what influence for good they can exert on their husbands. They wield it unconsciously no doubt, but that is not enough. They must have that consciousness, and the consciousness will give them the strength and show them the way to deal with their partners. The pity of it is that most wives do not interest themselves in their husbands doings. They think they have no right to do so. It never occurs to them that it is their duty to become guardians of their husbands’ character, as it is the latter’s to be guardians of their wives’ character. And yet what can be plainer than that husband and wife are equal sharers of each other’s virtues and vices? But who but a woman can effectively awaken the wives to a sense of their power and duty? This is but a part of the women’s movement against drink.
 
 There must be enough women with proper equipment to study the statistics of drink, the causes that induce the habit and the remedies against it. They must learn the lesson from the past and realize that mere appeals to the addicts to give up drink cannot produce lasting effects. The habit has to be regarded as a disease and treated as such. In other words, some women have to become research students and carry on researches in a variety of ways. In every branch of reform constant study giving one a mastery over one’s subject is necessary. Ignorance is at the root of failures, partial or complete, of all reform movements whose merits are admitted. For  every  project masquerading under the name of reform is not necessarily worthy of bring so designated.

183,,THE CAUSE OF IT,"
    
A Bangalore correspondent asks:
 You say that a married couple may have sexual union only when there is a mutual desire for a child and on no other account. Please let me know why one should wish for a child at all. Many people wish for children without fully realizing the responsibilities of parenthood, and many more wish for children fully knowing that they are incapable of discharging the responsibilities of a parent. Many persons who are physically and mentally unfit for parenthood wish for children. Don’t you think that it is wrong for these persons to procreate?
 I would like to know the motive behind the desire for children. Many people wish for children to bequeath their possesions and to break the monotony of their life. A few people wish for a male child lest the gates of Heaven would not be opened for them. Are not these prople wrong in wishing for a child?
It is good to seek causes for things. But it is not always possible
 to discover them. The desire for children is universal. But I do not know any convincing cause, if to see oneself perpetuated through one’s descendants is not a sufficient and convincing cause. My proposition, however, is not vitiated if the cause I give for the desire is not found sufficiently convincing. The desire is there. It seems to be natural. I am not sorry for having been born. It cannot be unlawful for me to see the best in me reproduced. Anyway till I see evil in procreation itself and till I see that the sexual act for mere pleasure is justifiable, I must hold that the sexual act is justified only where there is desire for children. I understand that this was so clear to the makers of Smritis that Manu described only the first-born as children born of
 dharma and the rest of kama—lust. The more throught I give to the subject as dispassionately as is possible, the more convinced I feel about the correctness of the position I have taken and am enforcing. It is becoming clearer to me that the difficulty lies in our ignorance of the subject with which needless secrecy is being associated.  Our thought is clouded. We dread to face consequences. We resort to half measures as if they were perfect or final and thus render them most difficult of execution. If our thoughts were clear, if we became sure of our ground, our speech and action would be firm.
 Thus if I am sure that every morsel of food I take is for building and sustaining the body, I shall never desire to take food for the pleasure of the palate. I shall further realize that if I have any desire to eat things because they are tasty, and apart from hunger or the thought of sustaining the body, it is a token of disease and I should seek to cure myself of it and not satisfy it as if it was lawful or healthy. Even so if I am quite clear that the sexual act, apart from the unquestioned desire for progeny, is unlawful and detrimental to the body, mind and soul, surely resistance to the desire will become easy– far easier than when I am not clear whether the gratification of mere desire is or is not lawful and beneficial. If I am quite clear about the unlawfulness of the desire, I shall treat it as if it were a disease and repel its attacks with all my vigour. I shall feel the stronger for the resistance. They are wrong, even untruthful, who claim that they do not like the act but are helpless and therefore resistance leaves them weak and defeated. If all such people were to examine themselves, they would discover that their thoughts deceive them. Their thoughts cherish the desire and their speech is a false interpreter of their thoughts. If on the other hand the speech is a true interpreter of the thoughts there can be no such thing as weakness. Defeat there may be. Weakness never.
 The correspondent’s objection to procreation by unhealthy parents is perfectly valid. They can have or should have no desire for progeny. They are deceiving themselves and the world if they say that they perform the sexual act for progeny. In an examination of any subject truthfulness is always assumed. Desire for progeny must not be feigned in order to cover the pleasure of sexual union.

189,"April 24, 1937",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
    
 April 24, 1937
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I had got your letter. I had a talk with Shankerlallibtech_259_footnoteat Hudli about Jaisukhlal. Shankerlal says that there is no connection between the charge against him and his being relieved. But he is of the opinion that there is not sufficient work in Kathiawar to justify payment of Rs. 75 to Jaisukhlal and that his work would not be worth that much anywhere else either. Jaisukhlal has not mastered the art of running a store, or of producing khadi, nor that of working in a spirit of co- operation with others. But he has no doubt at all  regarding Jaisukhlal’s integrity. If this statement of Shankerlal is correct, then no injustice is done to Jaisukhlal. If you do not  agree  with Shankerlal’s explanation, then you may employ him in the work you are doing for the spread of khadi. Take from him such work as will enable him to earn Rs. 75 or something more if he can. You can do this and, if he has the ability to earn Rs. 75 through khadi work, may help him to develop in.
 I myself am observing the extremely suspicious nature of Jaisukhlal and it has caused me much pain,. He sees Chhaganlal Joshi at the back of all his misfortunes, while I myself have been able to see no such thing in any matter. I know Chhaganlal’s merits and defects very well. I have even lived with him. I have seen in him no such failing that he would be after a man and do him ill just out of spite. His opinions are very often baseless. I also know that he lacks the capacity to cite evidence in support of his views.
 I have not informed you till now and on inquiring I find that Kanaiyo also has not done so. He was fairly ill during the Hudli trip. Either from over-exertion or for some other reason, he had got fever.
 
 He had got it as soon as we arrived there and it came down after four days. But he did not suffer in the least. The treatment also was the best possible. It consisted in his drinking as much water as he could—he took hot water with lime-juice and salt, then he was put on water mixed with honey, and then he was given fruit and then milk. He is still on milk and fruit. He used to get good sleep. It can practically be said that he did not require any nursing. He was not given any special comfort apart from a cot. He was given no privacy at all, nor was there any such facility.
 Today he has come riding five miles on bicycle of his own free will. There was no necessity for him to come for the sake of any work. But once he feels well he cannot sit idle. And I do not stop him from exerting himself within the limits of his strength. The matter was not at all worth writing to you about. There was no cause for worry. We had an experienced doctor with us But even his help was not taken. He did wish to give some medicine, but I emphatically forbade any medicine.
 Kanaiyo also has great faith in fasting as of course I too have. This time a special feature of my treatment was that I did not try enema at all. It could have been given with some special arrangement, but he used to pass stools in the normal course. I, therefore, did not insist on giving him enema. He did not suffer in the least; no doubt it was thanks to his fast and also to the purity of his life.
 At the time of giving away Manu and Nirmala, he had insisted on attending, and had joined in singing “Vaishnava jana”. Kanti also arrived exactly on the day of kanyadanlibtech_260_footnote. Manu was therefore very happy, although she spared Kanti, having persuaded herself to be content with Kanu’s presence.
 How is Kumi’s work going on? If she gets her  daughter admitted in the National School, exempt her from payment of fees.

 NAGPUR,
  [ 	April 25, 1937]libtech_266_footnote  Q. 	Would you be satisfied with the assurance from the Governors on the 	lines given by Sir Samuel Hoare and quotedlibtech_267_footnote 	by you?  	A. I would be satisfied with the assurance with a definition of the 	word ‘ordinarily’ which everybody can understand.  Will 	you kindly give me your own definition of the work ‘ordinarily’?  	A. definition has really to come from those who want to introduce 	the adverb. I have not introduced the word ‘ordinarily’ in the 	Congress resolutionlibtech_268_footnote. 	Congress meaning is quite clear. For, it asked for an assurance in 	connection with a definite programme. If that programme and 	everything similar to that programme is pursued by the Congress 	there should be no interference on the part of the Governor. If in 	the opinion of the Governors the worst happens as Lord Lothian has 	suggested, the Governors can dismiss the Cabinet, dissolve the 	Assemblies and appeal to the electorate to find out whom the 	electorate will support. If the Congress aim is to create deadlocks, 	what point is there is asking for any assurance from the Governors? 	As I have already said and as I have read the Congress resolution, 	the aim of the Congress is not to create deadlocks,, but its aim 	undoubtedly is to make Congress position so irresistible as to 	replace the present Act, which nobody likes, by an Act which will 	represent the will of the masses. This will be brought about by 	constitutional means permissible under the Act itself. And if the 	Congress by force of its majority and by skill of Congress Ministers 	advances its own constitutional position to such a pitch that the 	British Ministers cannot possibly resist it except by force of arms, 	surely there can be nothing to grumble at.  You 	have saidlibtech_269_footnote 	that the Congress wanted non-interference not non-dismissal.  Will 	you please explain the difference between the two?  	As a gentleman I cannot possibly ask for a promise that the Cabinet 	may never be dismissed. But I can ask that there should be no       4  Vide 	“ Extract From 	A.I.C.C. Resolution”, 16-3-1937; also “Interview to The 	Bombay Chronicle”. 	30-4-1937 
 interference in the day-to-day administration. I do not want  the Cabinet to be in a position of having to resign on the slightest pretext; for honourable resignation there must be honourable cause that anybody could see. If I have no assurance of non-interference the Governor may submit his Ministers to pinpricks which they would feel but which may not give them understandable cause to take to the public in justifying resignation. I would never put the Congress Cabinet in such embarrassing and humiliating position. The same thing would apply to the Governors. They would look incredibly foolish if on the slightest pretext they dismissed the Cabinet. Therefore, if Governors are gentlemen and want to  preserve  the honour of the nation whom they represent they will think fifty times before dismissing the Cabinet. I want to put them in that position so that there shall be no pinpricks from the Governors as all Ministers who worked under the Montford reforms have testified. Their position was made unbearable and humiliating and yet they were unable to resign, perhaps they would not. I do not know which was the case.

 Government to decide whether they have meant provincial autonomy by the Constitution they have framed or they have meant sometimes the reverse of Autonomy. But to the man in the street who knows nothing of legal quibbles or even of the Consititution that is the only question.
 With reference to Press reportlibtech_274_footnote from Nagpur stating that to a question whether  he thought, if the Congress did not accept office, the minority Ministries would win over the electorate by their ameliorative measures, Mr. Gandhi was reported to have said, “I should not be surprised,” Mr. Gandhi says:
Whoever is the party concerned for the Nagpur telegram, he has
 reported just the contrary of what I meant or at least what I intended to mean. My answer was that I should be surprised if minority Ministries would win over the electorate by  their  ameliorative measures in case Congress did not accept office. A slip of paper containing questions was handed to me through the crowd into the railway compartment which was none too empty. I hurriedly wrote out the answer in pencil. If the reporter maintains that I wrote the word ‘not’, I would very much like to see the original.

         April 30, 1937 Questioned 	whether he still adhered 	to the view that if 	Governors gave assurance to the effect that “ordinarily” they would not interfere with constitutional  activities of the Congress Ministers, the Congress would accept office, Gandhiji said,      
 in this matter his position should be properly understood. Gandhiji did not think that mere addition of the word ‘ordinarily’ to the formula would satisfy him or the Congress. Such assurance would be acceptable to him only if the qualifying word was “properly interpreted to our satisfaction”. Gandhiji further declared:
We should know the meaning of ‘ordinarily’ beforehand.libtech_278_footnote
 Our correspondent then drew Gandhiji’s attention to Prof. Keith’slibtech_279_footnote latest constitutional pronouncement published in today’s Leader and asked him about the Congress position vis-a-vis Governor’s special powers.
 Gandhiji smiled and said it was stale news and he had read it already in some paper yesterday.
 As I read Professor Keith’s statement I saw that he entirely endorsed the Congress position that the Congress does not seek any abrogation of the Act.
 Asked whether it would not be unconstitutional for the Congress Ministry to attempt to trample over the legitimate rights of the minorities, Gandhiji declared that  it would not only be unconstitutional but “suicidal”.

202,,HARIJANS ON BEGAR,"
    
 The newspapers have given publicity to the threat of certain Harijans in certain villages to transfer their allegiance to the Christian Missions seeking to wean them from Hinduism under promise of better treatment, and especially freedom from begarlibtech_280_footnoteto which they are subjected by savarna Hindus. It seems that representatives of the Hindu Mission and of the Harijan Sevak Sangh visited the aggrieved Harijans and got the savarna Hindus to promise better treatment. The storm has abated for the time being. I do not know what would have been the gain to the Missions concerned if the Harijans had gone over to their fold and how far the Harijans could have been claimed as bona fide converts. This I know that such proselytizing efforts demoralize society, create suspicions and bitterness and retard the all- round progress of society. If, instead of wanting the so-called conversion as the price of better treatment, Christian Missions co- operated with Harijan sevaks in their effort to ease the burderns of Harijans, their help would be welcomed and the evolution of society would be hastened.
But I write this more to awaken savarna conscience than to

 criticize the Mission methods brought to light. The system of forced labour exacted by petty land-owners from Harijans and other classes called backward is almost universal in India. The petty landlords are mostly Hindus. Harijans and others can legally resist forced labour. They are slowly but surely being awakened to a sense of their rights. They are numerous enough to enforce them. But all grace will be gone when savarna Hindus impotently resign themselves to their merited fate. Better surely by far if they will recognize their duty of regarding Harijans as blood-brothers, entitled to the respect that belongs to man and to receive due payment for services voluntarily performed.
 It is the privilege of Harijan savaks, no matter to what organization they belong, to befriend Harijans to study their condition in detail, to approach savarna Hindus and show them as gently as possible what their duty is towards those whom they have treated as outcastes of society and deprived even of legal rights.
 From the papers before me I further find that in Ode and some other villages in Gujarat the savarna Hindus take from Harijans who dispose of their dead cattle half the hide. This is unlike the usual practice of allowing the Harijans to own the dead cattle they remove. In some cases Harijans not only retain the dead cattle they remove, but receive a payment for the labour of removing carcasses. The matter demands more investigation and fair adjustment. If Harijans  were better treated and if savarna Hindus had no horror of dead cattle and had no superstitious laws of pollution, they would learn the art of flaying the dead cattle and turning every part of the carcasses into wealth, both to the benefit of themselves and the Harijans whom they may invite to help them in the process of disposing of their dead cattle.

203,,ESSAYS ON BARTER SYSTEM,"
    
 Reader will remember that a prize of Rs. 500 was announced for the best essay recommending a barter system. The terms were also given. The time for sending the essays having elapsed, the Board of Examiners entered upon their task and have reported that none of the essays fulfil the conditions laid down. The following is their reportlibtech_281_footnote.
 The prize has not been withdrawn by the donor.  The examiners, Prof. K.T. Shah, Shri Vaikunth Mehta and Prof. J.C.
 
 Kumarappa, have kindly signified their readiness to examine any further essays that may be sent. I would, however, advise competitors, if any are willing, to strictly conform to the requirements laid down by the examiners. It is clear from their note and it is but natural that no essay will pass muster unless it reaches the level expected by them, and none will reach that level unless writers are industrious enough to study the necessary literature on the subject and build on their study an original thesis. It may be that the prize is not sufficiently tempting for such an effort. If that is so, I can only say that those who write for the mere monetary value of prizes hardly ever realize the expectations of donors. Without love of subject itself, high merit is not to be expected in difficult competitions like the one about the system of barter. The time for handing in the essays is fixed as 31st December, 1937. All essays should be addressed to Prof. J.C. Kumarappa, Maganwadi, Wardha. No further extension of time will be given, and if no effort succeeds the prize will be finally withdrawn.

204,,A MORAL DILEMMAlibtech_282_footnote,"
    
A friend writes:libtech_283_footnote
 About two and a half years ago this city was convulesd by a social tragedy. A Vaishya gentleman had a sixteen-year old daughter. She had a maternal uncle aged twenty-one years studying in college in the same city. The two fell secretly in love with each other. The girl is said to have become pregnant. When the true state of affairs at last became known, the lovers committed suicide by taking poison. The girl died immediately but the boy died a couple of days afterwards in the hospital At the time when the
 storm was at its height and nobody had a kind word to say about the deceased unfortunate lovers, I shocked everybody by expressing my opinion that under the afore-mentioned circumstances the young lovers ought to have been allowed to have their way. But mine remained a voice in the wilderness. What is your opinion in the matter?
I have deliberately kept back the name of the correspondent and
 the place at the request of the writer as he did not want old sores to be reoponded by a revival of an old controversy. All the same I feel that  a public discussion of this delicate topic is necessary. In my opinion such marriages as are interdicted in a particulars society cannot be recongnized all at once or at the will of an individual. Nor has society
 
 or relatives of parties concerned any right to impose their will upon and forcibly curtail the liberty of action of the young people who may want to contract such marriages. In the instance cited by the correspondent both the parties had fully attained maturity.  They  could well think for themselves. No one had a right forcibly  to prevent them from marrying each other if they wanted to. Society could at the most refuse to recognize the marriage, but it was the height of tyranny to drive them to suicide. Marriage taboos are not universal and are largely based on social usage.libtech_284_footnote
 These alliances are not taboo in every society. The Christian, Muslim, Parsi and other communities do not observe this taboo. It is not even taboo in all Hindu varnas. The same varna has different customs in different Provinces. Among the so-called high caste Brahmins of the South, such alliances are not only not tabooed, but on the contrary are considered commendable.libtech_285_footnote
 The usage varies from Province to Province and as between different divisions. This does not mean that the youth may ride roughshod over all established social customs and inhibitions. Before they decide to do so, they must convert public opinion to their side. In the meantime, the individuals concerned ought patiently to bide their time, or, if they cannot do that calmly and quietly, to face the consequences of social ostracism.
 At the same time it is equally the duty of society not to take up a heartless, step-motherly attitude towards those who might disregard or break the established conventions. In the instance described by my correspondent the guilt of driving the young couple to  suicide certainly rests on the shoulders of society if the version that is before me in correct.

  	Shri Narahari Parikh, Secretary of the Goseva Sangh, has sent me a 	brief description of his tour in some Kathiawar States which he 	undertook for examining the cattle wealth there. I hope to publish 	it in Harijanbandhu, in two instalments. The following [item 	in this issue] is the first of these.libtech_286_footnoteThere was a time when Kathiawar cows were highly 	praised. That variety still exists but it is gradually disappearing. 	This wealth, which is being destroyed, may still be saved and fresh 	additions made to it if the rulers of Kathiawar and their officials 	put in the effort. There is room for improvement in all industries. 	Each one of these could be made more paying. But this possibility is 	perhaps the greatest in animal husbandry. Knowledge, diligence and 	patience are all that is required. According to our present 	knowledge, it is even claimed that the health of the human race is 	especially dependent upon our cattle wealth, i.e., on cow’s milk. 	India is a country where one expects the cows to be of the highest 	quality. But they are of the poorest quality and are at present a 	burden on the land.  	Shri Purushottam Joshi of the Bhavnagar institution, who is an 	expert in animal husbandry, suggests the following three ways of 	looking after cows:  Vagrant 		bulls should be 		castrated and 		used as 		bullocks.  Good 		pedigree bulls should be 		kept in 		every village and 		these should 		be well 		cared for. Every 		farmer should have his 		own cow.     
 All the States in Kathiwar can readily do this without incurring any loss. But the reader should now read the statement made by Shri Narahari Parikh.

 The purpose of the tour of Mauritius, etc., is quite different from the purpose behind the tour of Sumatra and other countries. Burma, Sumatra, Java, Siam, etc., have some connection with Eastern culture and it seems natural enough for them to have links with Indian languages.

  	I have shown your scheme to Anna also. His views are enclosed.  	What you have written about Punjabi in the first paragraph does not 	seem to be correct. For, if Punjabi is quite similar to Hindi, are 	not Bengali, Oriya, Assamese and Sindhi also very much like Hindi? 	But at the same time it can be said that Hindustani and Urdu are 	also as much in use as Punjabi in the Punjab. So whatever work is to 	be done there should be carried on only through local people. It is 	for this reason that just as no activity is carried on by the Hindi 	Prachar Samiti in the United Provinces, there should be none in the 	Punjab also. You must keep in mind that we do not propagate Hindi 	where Urdu is spoken. We consider Urdu speaking people as Hindi 	speaking ones. As for the rest of the scheme my view is that all the 	activities should be self-sufficient.  	Let me give you one more idea. I am of the opinion that we have 	attempted nothing original in our method of teaching, i.e., we have 	hardly made any efforts for making the learning of Hindi easy and 	interesting as has been done in the case of English. Who amongst us 	can tell how many days it takes to teach Hindi, or in how many days 	the script may be taught? We have not evolved a model self- teaching 	primer in any of the Indian languages. Some little effort has been 	made in Tamil, etc., but I see nothing original, nothing 	extraordinary in it. If we can do something on these lines the 	spread    
 of Hindi will be greatly expedited and lakhs of rupees saved. We do have a good many teachers in the South because of the  Dakshin Bharat [Hindi] Prachar [Sabha] but do we have someone who can take up this kind of task? I think that such an experiment must find a place in one of our schemes.

 WARDHA,
 May 6, 1937
 Q. I take it that you had much to do with the latest resolutionlibtech_297_footnoteof the Working Committee on office-acceptance. If so, is there any truth in the suggestion that you have yielded to the left-wingers?
A. As a matter of fact there were no left-wingers and right-
 wingers this time. The only question discussed was about the form the resolution had to take.
 Do you not see that there is very little difference between Mr. Butler’slibtech_298_footnotestatement and the Working Committee’s resolution?
If that is so, why is there the slightest difficulty about Mr.
 Butler’s instructing the Governors to offer office to the Congress leaders in terms of the Congress Resolution?
 
 April 26, he said: “His Majesty’s Government have no intention of countenancing the use of special powers for purposes other than those for which Parliament intended them. It is certainly not their intention that the Governors, by a narrow or legalistic interpretation of their own responsibilities should trench upon the wide powers which it was the purpose of Parliament to place in the hands of Ministers and which it is desired they should use in furtherance of the programmes they have advocated.”
 Leaving Lord Zetland’s speechlibtech_299_footnote aside for the moment, what is the discourtesy you detect in Mr. Butler’s statement?
I have never known a great party, commanding a majority that
 the Congress does, having such a thing as office thrown at it, and its leaders treated as if they were petitioners. If they were Ministers would they have to send applications to the Governors for interviews and run the risk of their applications being summarily rejected? I had thought that in autonomy the Ministers got the audience of their Governors for the asking and often the Governors had to give in to the Ministers where the latter had felt displeased or offended. The British Government know that the Congress is out for complete  independence. It seems to me that the British Cabinet resent  this attitude of Congress. If so, they should plainly tell the Congress and the world that they will not tolerate complete independence  and should cease to play with the word ‘autonomy’. If on the other hand they do not mind natural evolution of India to its destiny, whatever it may be, they must treat the Congress with the  consideration  its position demands and disarm suspicion that, owing to their speech and action, is deepening.

 So far as the tone is concerned, it is an undoubted improvement upon his last speech on the subject. But I fear it is no contribution to the removal of the deadlock.
 The last resolution of the Working Committee is the clearest possible annotation of the All-India Congress Committee’s resolution, in accordance with which assurances were asked for. Now the world knows what was meant. Surely, it is no strain upon the Constitution Act for the Governors to give the assurance that whenever a situation
 
 minorities and others in India . . . Opinions might differ as to the extent and necessity for such safeguards but it could not be doubted that the minorities in India themselves attached the utmost importance to them.”

 is created which to them appears intolerable, they will take upon their shoulders the responsibility of dismissing the Minsters which they have the right to do, instead of expecting them to resign or submit to the Governor’s wishes.
Citing the performances of Minstries formed by Governors in
 the face of universal opposition does not improve matters but strengthens suspicion. In my opinion, the Congress is in earnest and wants to make a serious effort, if it takes office to make a substantial advance by that method towards its unequivocal goal of complete independence in so far as it is constitutionally possible to make that advance.

226,,COCHIN-TRAVANCORE,"
  
 My worst fears have come true and Cochin and Travancore are at war with each other. The pity of it is that the war is over a matter of vital interest to Hinduism and therefore to the whole of India. It is a war between light and darkness. I am loath to think  that  the population of Cochin is behind the Cochin Maharaja’s action. He may regulate worship in the Cochin temples under his jurisdiction in any manner he likes. But even the most orthodox Hinduism would hardly permit him to regulate the private conduct of the visitors to the Cochin temples. In no temple in India where Harijans  are  not permitted to worship are trustees authorized to scrutinize the actions of savarna Hindus who are entitled as a matter of right to visit the temples.
 In Cochin the Maharaja has interfered in respect of a templelibtech_303_footnoteover which he has no exclusive control. The Maharaja of Travancore, too, possesses substantial right over the temples in question. The Cochin order is clearly an interference with that right. If Travancore has sinned, it is no concern of Cochin. The Cochin order is an interference with the right of private judgment.
 In this crisis the duty of the public seems to me to be clear. Meetings should be held all over the country condemning the Cochin orders and asking for their withdrawal. The most orthodox Hindus can surely join such protest meetings even though they may not be in favour of throwing open all temples to Harijans. Seeing  that  the Cochin public is directly interested in the action of its Maharaja, they may lead the agitation. The pundits of India should dispassionately examine the orders and express their unbiased opinion. I am inclined to think that the Travancore Durbar may well invite the opinion of pundits on the single question of the religious propriety of the Cochin order and undertake to abide by their opinion. In other words, Travancore may well offer to abide by the verdict of an arbitration tribunal consisting of unbiased pundits who will be universally accepted as such. The opinion of an assembly of such pundits would be the nearest approach to an arbitration tribunal. For, whilst the
 
 
 Travancore Durbar had a perfect right to open to Harijans the temples within their sole jurisdiction and ownership and without reference to the opinion of pundits, it would hardly be right to propound a new Smriti in respect of temples where there is joint jurisdiction. The  Harijan cause must be always and everywhere above suspicion. Travancore’s glorious action is capable of standing meticulous scrutiny on the ground of moral correctness.

227,,THE COCHIN TEMPLE-ENTRY BAN,"
  
 Since the foregoinglibtech_304_footnotewas   written  the  following  was  received from Shri C.K. Parameswaran Pillai, President, Kerala Harijan Sevak Sangh...libtech_305_footnote
 In a letter to The Madras Mail from somebody from Ernakulam, dated the 20th April, 1937, it is stated that considerable resentment is felt here at the criticisms in Travancore of the Cochin Government’s order regarding the Koodalmanikkam Temple at Irinjalakuda, and the vast majority of the Hindus in the State support the Government’s action. Again on the 23rd April The
 Madras Mail’s own correspondent wrote to that paper that “leading citizens  of Irinjalakuda support the Cochin Government’s declaration that the temple was defiled by the participation in its ceremonies of tantris who had officiated in temples to which avarnas were admitted. ”
 The Cochin Legislative Council has been passing resolutions year after year recommending to Government the abolition of  untouchability. Resoutions were also passed at public meetings on several occasions in support of temple-entry for Harijans. Having reasons, therefore, to doubt therefore, to doubt the correctness of the statement in The Madras Mail, I went to Ernakulam on the 25th April accompanied by Sjt. M. Govindan, B.A.,B.L., retired Judge and the President of the Trivandrum District Committee of the Harijan Sevak Sangh, to study the real situation of affairs in Cochin. I interviewed several important persons including the Thachudaya Kaimal, the administrator of the   Koodalmanikkam   Temple,   and  the   Prisendent   of the
 S.N.D.P. Yogam. I am now in a position, to say difinitely that there is no foundation for the statement in The Madras Mail that the majority of the people   of   Cochin   support   the    action   of    the    Cochin   Government in
 excommunicating the tantris. The Hindu of the 23rd April has published two
 
 statements... denouncing in unmistakable terms the action taken by  the Cochin Government against the Nedumpally Nambudiri the  tantri  concerned...
From the social and moral standpoint the action of the Cochin
 Government is unjustifiable and inconsistent. The dharmashastras clearly lay down that anybody who takes a sea voyage—even a person who remains in the sea for three consecutive days—becomes a patita.  It was for this reason that Professor (now Sir) Ramunny Menon was ostracized by the Cochin Government and prohibited from entering into Cochin temples. A few years later when the Cochin Maharaja’s son returned from England after his education, the rule was abrogated and admission was given to all England-returned men to temples. The Cochin temples became polluted then, and the Travancore Government might have taken such steps against the Nedumpally Nambudiripad at that time which the Cochin Government have now taken.
 If in fact we apply strictly the rules of the dharmashastras to the present day, the savarna Hindus will all have to be treated as patitas and they cannot enter the temples there. But in these progressive days no reasonable Government will think of doing such an unreasonable thing. I hope, therefore, that the Cochin Government will reconsider their order and withdraw the same. The Dewan, Sir  R.  K. Shanmukham Chetty, is a cultured man of modern views and a supporter of the Justice Party. I have no doubt that he will do what is proper and restore public confidence in his administration.

How is 	Ramachandran? What headway have you made in music? When do you 	expect to visit us again?

Kumri is a small village, about seventeen miles from Belgaum. Shri 	Gangadharrao has built an ashram there. The annual meeting of the 	Gandhi Seva Sangh was to have been held in Hudli but the rain- god 	intervened and the members of the Sangh ran from the pandal and took 	shelter under the roof of the weaving-school of the Kumri    
 Ashram. After a great deal of discussion, some important resolutions were passed there, of which the following are the most noteworthy. I give theselibtech_309_footnotein the original Hindi language.
 The Hindi is so simple that no reader will need a translation. Despite this, if anyone fails to understand them, he should get them translated by someone who knows Hindi.
 As regards the first [three] resoultions, it would be sufficient to say that the changes made have been introduced with a view to the expansion of constructive work. These are not made as alternatives or additions  to  constructive  work.  The  object  of   the   permissionlibtech_310_footnoteis merely to assist it. If this objective is not clearly understood, the fears of Shri Kishorelal may perhaps prove true. The Sangh exists for the very purpose of keeping constructive work alive, for making it interesting and for spreading it from Kashmir to Cape Comorin and from Karachi to Dibrugarh. This is because constructive work has been regarded as the mark of truth and non-violence. For its success contact has to be established with three crores of voters. In order to make this contact effective, if some members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh have to enter Legislatures, it becomes a clear duty of the Sangh to make provision for it.
 The fourth resolution is almost self-evident. No matter  how  many wells and ponds are added, they will prove useful. They increase the country’s wealth and, moreover, wells, ponds and such otherwater- reservouirs constructed by the Sangh, will of course be open to all Harijans. Hence if these are built at appropriate sites, they will provide water to innumerable thirsty Harijans and the donors as well as the Sangh will earn the blessings of the beneficiaries. Hence, those who wish to do so should send contributions, without a second thought, to the Sangh for the purpose of digging wells for Harijans.
 The fifth resolution is an all-embracing one. The assumption behind it is that village welfare work begins with the service of  Bhangis, i.e., with village sanitation. How this can be done is explained in the resolution. It is worth noting that the task of providing medicines and running schools has not been considered essential. There is no mention in the resolution of spinning and such other crafts. The implication is that these things will have to be done, but the
 
 stress is laid on what one has to start with. This is because the aim of the resolution is to remove the fear entertained by some members of being boycotted while doing the work of sanitation.
 In the sixth resolution the propagation of Hindi has been advocated and the methods indicated. As long as leaders feel it infra dig to appear for an examination in Hindi, others will not be very enthusiastic about it. So long as public institutions do not carry on their business in Hindi or so long as Hindi translations are not made available where the use of English is found indispensable, Hindi cannot be propagated on a large scale. Here Hindi  includes Hindustani. There is no distinction between the two from the point of view of the Sangh.
 The Sangh has through the seventh resolution demonstrated its zeal for national education, but the national Vidyapiths have been entrusted with the task, and that is as it should be.
 By the eighth resolution, the meaning of the abolition of untouchability from the standpoint of the Sangh has been clarified. The limits which have been accepted by the Harijan Sevak Sangh for crores of persons so far as the abolition of untouchability is concerned, are in no way sufficient for members of the Sangh who regard truth and non-violence from my standpoint. So long as there are restrictions as regards inter-dining and intermarriage, untouchability is bound to survive to some extent. It is necessary for members of the Sangh to give up these restrictions. Anyone who sincerely serves Harijans cannot possibly observe such restrictions.
 Although the ninth resolution is not related to the constructive work of the Congress, it is closely connected with the economic condition of India. Crores of rupees are lost because of our indifference towards our cattle wealth. The struggle between the cow and the buffalo on the one hand and between cattle and man on the other can continue only to the detriment of all the three. This is because if cows are allowed to perish, buffaloes are bound to follow suit and drag human beings behind. The latter will survive if cows do, but buffaloes have either to return to their original wild state or continue to survive in a very small number. The Sangh has pointed out the easy, straight and consequently inexpensive way of escaping such an untimely death; and that is to insist upon using cow’s milk and nothing but cow’s milk and its products. This objective will probably be achieved without much difficulty if an all-out effort is
 made. The appeal to study the cow problem scientifically has been made with a view to justifying what has been said in the above resoulution about cattle wealth and helping those engaged in goseva propaganda.libtech_311_footnote

242,,DISCUSSION WITH WORKERSlibtech_318_footnote,"
        BARDOLI, 
  [MAY 	11, 1937 ] 	libtech_319_footnote  CONGRESS 	WORKER: But it 	is 11 miles from 	the Railway Station, and 	you have 	said that the place 	should not be 	more than seven miles 	from the Station. 	Sydla  is 	two furlongs and Afwa only two miles. GANDHIJI: 	 If I said seven miles, I meant seventy. At  any rate that  	should be our aim. We have ultimately to reach the villages which 	are considered inaccessible today. And where else can you have this 	vast supply of water and so much open space for the thousands of 	people we are going to have, as also for the numerous cows we shall 	need for        
 them? And then what a charming name is Haripura! Hari meaning God.
 It will be frightfully expensive, everything having to be carried ten miles by motor-lorries and buses. It is not in the centre of the taluk, as are other places, and the village people will be hard put to it in going from one end of the taluk to the other.
 Why should we fight shy of the distances and why should we have motor-lorries? We have any number of bullock carts in the taluk.
 If we have the Congress at Afwa, we can have water from Bardoli at little expense. The ginning companies would readily oblige us with their engines for electricity and something like Rs. 15,000 would be saved.
 That means that we should always have our Congress in the vicinity of towns and cities! Why should we not do without electricity? And while people from Surat and the neighbouring villages will flock to Afwa near Bardoli, what about the Raniparaj people–the hill people—whom we want to acquaint somewhat with the Congress?
 You must not be swayed by my argument unless it appeals to your reason and experience.

  	I  am  surprised  at  my  remarkslibtech_321_footnotelibtech_322_footnotebeing 	  misunderstood.   I   still maintain that whilst Lord Zetland's 	statement is agreeably worded, it does not remove the deadlock in 	the sense that it gives no specific answer to the specific Congress 	demand, namely, that the method in which the Governors will use 	their powers of interference whenever they fear an emergency would 	be that of dismissal of the Ministry rather than expecting the 	Ministry to resign or submit  to  the Governor's wishes. I hold that 	this is perfectly consitutional and  equally honourable for both 	parties. The Governors will reason with their Ministers. The 	Ministers would be bound courteously to listen to what they say.But 	if reason fails to carry conviction the only proper course for both 	parties would be for the Governors to dismiss such Ministers and 	dissolve the Assembly or take whatever measures may be open to them 	constitutionally.

  	I met Naranbhailibtech_323_footnotelibtech_324_footnote. Sardar also was present. We had a long talk. His love 	for you is boundless. When I talked about  Manubhailibtech_325_footnotelibtech_326_footnotehe 	started crying. He said: ""If she wants to marry only with our 	consent, why does she bring up Manubhai's name every time? We will 	never be pleased with that marriage. She has taken a pledge to 	remain unmarried. Let her keep it. But if at all she wants to marry, 	then there are two or three good young men in our community; she may 	select one of them."" This is the substance of what he said. I 	pacified him. I told him that you were not bent upon marrying him. 	If you at all marry, I said, you would marry Manubhai, but that if 	your parents would not gladly give you their blessings you would be 	prepared to remain unmarried. I also told him that you certainly 	wished that they should not press you to marry anybody else. Sardar 	also spoke in favour of Manubhai. He said that now in this age girls 	should be given some freedom; after having educated them we should 	not expect that they should always obey our wishes. But all this had 	no effect on Naranbhai. I have assured him that I would not marry 	you off to Manubhai secretly.  	Now my advice is that if you wish you may send this letter to 	Manubhai. Even if you don't do that, you may, if you think it 	proper, write to him and tell him that your marriage is likely to be 	delayed and may not even come off. I am sure you would not wish to 	marry after the death of your parents. Both of you should wish that 	they may live long. It would be a different matter if your patience, 	your blameless conduct and Manubhai's purity should melt their 	hearts. But I do not think that in this case anything except time 	and the conduct of you both can have any effect. If occasion arises 	I would certainly be ready to say more.

Tell Sushila that, if all of you had come here, I could have 	accommodated you but wouldn’t have been able to give you the 	privacy you had there.

And can anybody 	misguide or coerce all the representatives of three Provinces? If 	injustice has been done, why do all those representatives, who are 	still alive, put up with it? I, therefore, don't understand this 	talk about injustice. I don't even     
 understand what Sardar is believed to have done. I felt that the whole agitation was got up. But if I don't understand this matter properly, you may reason with me and convince me. I have no antipathy to Nariman. My attitude has nothing to do with the charges which have been levelled against him. The truth or falsehood of these charges can be inquired into whenever Nariman wishes. I learnt only today that he is your friend. I have expressed my opinion in a perfectly objective spirit.
 I was pained to read about . . . libtech_332_footnoteI have published only what both of them told me and that, too, becuase she wanted me to publish it. It seems to me that . . . libtech_333_footnotemakes no distinction between truth and falsehood. You may show her this.
 I had written to Dev. I have received his reply. I did not write immediately.
 I was glad to learn that the work in Saswad has not been given up. I believe in the saying, ""Not to embark upon a thing in the first instance."" If you take up any other work now, cling to it.
 It would have been better if you four had asked me to give you an appointment. I accept your argument that I wouldn't have been able to say much without knowing the position at Saswad. You are also right in saying that this is only the beginning of my experience of village life, and that, therefore, all of us are equal in that respect. Even so, my ideas have an element of originality in them, and the power behind them comes from ahimsa. I think, therefore, that all four of you would have learnt something from me.
 I like your effort to learn the art of thinking for I had found your speechlibtech_334_footnoteat Hudli lacking in thought. Your ideas there seemed to me like so much smoke emitted by your brain. They were not outpourings of the heart. I wanted to spare some time and discuss them with you and convince you, as clearly as two and two make four, that there was no real thinking behind them. But you left in a great hurry and so I did not get any opportunity. Since I was in no hurry to prove to you your lack of thought, I didn't hold you back. I was sure that you yourself would sooner or later see this deficiency in you. And now I see your admission of it in this very letter of yours. It is understandable that you do not see this deficiency in the ideas you expressed at Hudli. But if you really learn how to think, you are
 
 bound to see the deficiency in those ideas.
 I, therefore, like you having given up the thought of asking for my views regarding principles. I will like it better still if you resolve to make no speeches till you have mastered the art of thinking, and you will acquire the art the sooner if you make no speeches.

He has 	publicly recognized 	the conciliatory 	tone in 	which the 	speech was 	couched, but 	it leaves 	him enough 	loop-hole to say 	that he 	meant nothing more 	than is 	laid down in the 	Government of 	India Act.

Courtesy: 	Lilavati Asar     	The Working Committee has emphasized the necessity of the members of 	the Legislatures and other workers taking the constructive programme 	of 1920 to the three crore villagers between whom and their 	representatives a direct contact has been established. The 	representatives may if they choose neglect them, or give them some 	paltry or even substantial relief from financial burdens; but  they 	cannot give them self-confidence, dignity and the power of 	continuously bettering their own position unless they  will  	interest them in the fourfold constructive programme i.e., universal 	production and use of khadi through universal hand-spinning, Hindu- 	Muslim or rather communal unity, promotion of total prohibition by 	propaganda among those who are addicted to the drink habit, and 	removal by Hindus of untouchability root and branch.  	It was announced in 1920 and 1921 from a thousand platforms that 	attainment of swaraj by the non-violent method was impossible 	without these four things. I hold that it is not less true today.  	It is one thing to improve the economic condition of the masses by 	State regulation of taxation, and wholly another for them to feel 	that they have bettered their condition by their own sole personal 	effort. Now this they can only do through hand-spinning and other 	village handicrafts. Similarly 	it is one thing to regulate communal conduct by    
 means of pacts between leaders, voluntary or imposed by the State; it is wholly different for the masses to respect one another's religious and outward observances. This cannot be done unless the legislators and workers would go out among the villagers and teach them mutual toleration.
 Again it is one thing to impose, as we must, prohibition by law, and another to sustain it by willing obedience to it. It is a defeatist, arm-chair mentality which says that it cannot work without an expensive and elaborate system of espionage. Surely if the workers went out to the villagers and demonstrated the evil of drink wherever it is prevalent, and if research scholars found  out the causes of alcoholism and proper knowledge was imparted to the people,
 prohibition should not only prove inexpensive but profitable. This is a work essentially for women to handle.
 Lastly, we may banish by statute, as we must, the evil consequences of untouchability. But we cannot have real independence unless people banish the touch me not spirit from their hearts. The masses cannot act as one man or with one mind unless they eradicate untouchability from their hearts.
 Thus this and the three other items are a matter of true mass education. And it has become imperatively necessary now that three crores of men and women have rightly or wrongly power put into their hands. However hedged in it is, Congressmen and others who want the suffrages of these voters have it in their hands either to educate the three crores of mankind along the right  lines  or  the wrong. It would be the wrong line to neglect them  altogether  in  matters which most vitally concern them.

257,,257. WHOSE IS THE BLAME?,"
 With reference to  my  notelibtech_341_footnotein  Harijan  of  17th  April,  1937, about the alleged ill-treatment of Christians by Hindus, I have received two letters. One is from Shri C.K. Parameswaran Pillai, President of the Kerala Harijan Sevak Sangh, and the other from Dr. M.E. Naidoo of Nagercoil. Shri Pillai writes:
 I read in the Harijan your statement regarding the complaint made by Father Petro about the interference of an Excise peon with some new converts to Christianity. As soon as I returned from Madras I wrote to this priest for detailed information regarding the incidents referred to in his card. Having received no reply
 
 from him I sent a reminder yesterday. If he gives me sufficient materials, I will enquire into the matter and make a report.
 Dr. Naidoo writes a long letter sending me countercomplaints. He cites 12 cases of disturbances by Christians during the last two years. They are taken from his periodical reports made to the kerala provincial Harijan Sevak Sangh. I take the following extractslibtech_342_footnotefrom his letter.
 Of course the counter-complaints cannot disapprove the charges brought by Father Petro. I hope, therefore, that he will reply to Shri Shri Pillai’s letter and enable him to deal with or refute the charges brought by him. It is the duty of the Harijan Sevak Sangh to promote harmony betweem Harijans and others with whom they come in daily contact. It is equally its duty to protect Harijans from ill-treatment as also to protect others from being molested by them.

IDEALlibtech_343_footnote","
 A FRIEND WRITES:libtech_344_footnote
 In the current issue of Harijan Sevak in your article entitled “A Moral Dilemma”libtech_345_footnoteyou have observed, “Many marriage taboos appear to have grown out of social customs.libtech_346_footnoteThey are nowhere seen to rest on any vital, moral or religious principle.” My own instinct based upon my experience tells me that probably these taboos were promulgated out of eugenic considerations. It is a well-known principle of the science of eugenics that the issue resulting from the crossing of exogamous elements is eugenically fitter than the product of endogamous unions. That is the reason why in Hinduism sagotra ( ) and sapinda ( ) marriage are interdicted. On the other hand if we admit social custom with all its kaleidoscopic variety and change to be sole reason for these taboos, we are left with no strong reason why  marriages  between paternal uncle and niece, or for the matter of that between brother and sister, should absolutely be tabooed. If, as you say, the begetting of progeny be the only legitimate object of marriage then the choice of partners would become purely a question of eugenic harmony. Are all other considerations to be ruled
 
  here.     
  universal 	and are largely based on social usage.” 
 out of court as relatively unimportant? If not, what should be their order of precedence? I would set it down as follows;
  mutual 		attraction or love; eugenic fitness;  approval 		and consent 		of the respective 		families concerned; 		and consideration for the interest of the social order to which one belongs; spiritual 		development. What do you say to it? . . .  
 I entirely agree with you that a married person who confines the sex act strictly to the purpose of procreation should be regarded as a brahmachari. I also hold with you that in the case of a married couple who have practised the rule of purity and self-control before and after marriage a single act of union must lead to conception. In support of your first point there is in our Shastras the celebrated story of Vishwamitra and Arundhati, the wife of Vasishtha who in spite of her one hundred sons was greeted  by Vishwamitra as a perfect brahmacharini , whose command even the elements were bound to obey because her connubial relations with her husband were purely directed to the attainment and discharge of the function of motherhood. But I doubt whether even the Hindu Shastras would support your ideal of having only one offspring irrespective of whether it is male or female. It seems to me, therefore, that if you liberalize your ideal of married life so as to include the begetting of one male offspring in addition to the possible female ones, it would go a long way towards satisfying many married couples.
 I do not know what the scientific basis for the various taboos in respect of marriage relationships is. But it seems to me clear that a social custom or usage that helps the practice of virtue and  self- control should have the sanctity of a moral law. If it is eugenic considerations that are at the root  of interdiction of marriages between brother and sister, then they ought to apply equally to cousin-marriages. A safe rule of conduct, therefore, would be as a rule to respect such taboos where they exist in a marriage enumerated by my correspondent. But I would change their order of importance and put 'love' last in the list. By giving it the first place,  the  other conditions are liable to be overshadowed by it altogether and rendered more or less nugatory. Therefore, spiritual development ought to be given the first place in the choice for marriage. Service should come next, family considerations and the interest of the social order should have the third place, and mutual attraction or 'love' the fourth and the last place. This means that 'love' alone, where the other four conditions are not fulfilled, should not be held as a valid reason for marriage. At the same time, marriage where there is no love should equally be ruled out even though all the other conditions are fully complied with. I should score out the condition of eugenic fitness, because  the begetting of offspring being the central purpose of marriage, eugenic
 fitness cannot be treated merely as a condition, it is the sine qua non
of marriage.
 Hindu Shastras certainly show a marked bias in favour of the male offspring. But this orginated at a time when physical warfare was the order of the day and adequate man-power was a sine qua non of success in the struggle for existence. The number of sons that a man had was therefore then looked upon as a mark of virility and strength and to facilitate the begetting of numerous offspring even polygamy was sanctioned and encouraged. But if we regard marriage as a sacrament, there is room in it only for one offspring, and that is why in our Shastras the first offspring, described as [dharmaja], i.e., 'duty-born', all subsequent issues being referred to as     [ kamaja], i.e., lust-born'. I make no distinction between son and daughter. Such distinction is in my opinion invidious and wrong. The birth of a son or a daughter should be welcome alike.
 The story of Vishwamitra and Vasishtha is good as an illustration of the principle that the sexual act performed solely for the purpose of begetting offspring is not inconsistent with the highest ideal of brahmacharya. But the whole of that story need not be taken literally. Sexual intercourse for the purpose of carnal satisfaction is reversion to animality, and it should therefore be man's endeavour to rise above it. But failure to do so as between husband and wife cannot be regarded as a sin or a matter of obloquy. Millions in this world eat for the satisfaction of their palate; similarly millions of the husbands and wives indulge in the sex act for their carnal satisfaction and will continue to do so and also pay the inexorable penalty in the shape of numberless ills with which nature visits all violations of its order. The ideal of absolute brahmacharya or of married brahmacharya is for those who aspire to a spiritual or higher life; it is the sine qua non of such life.

  	I got your letter. Certainly Lilavati is proud but she has no malice 	in her. One who has malice stings. Lilavati speaks out on the 	instant whatever she feelbut harbours no ill will afterwards. 	Anybody who has malice cannot tolerate the happiness of others and 	will never hesitate to harm him or her when an opportunity occurs. I 	have not seen Lilavati ever doing this. To speak sarcastically is 	not a sign of malice. It is just a way of speaking with some. It is 	a fact that she looks up to very few with respect. But that is only 	a sign of pride. One who is eager to have good relations with others 	should keep silent and serve them as much as possible. You have less 	thinking power and have, therefore, less capacity for weighing 	things. You should therefore, practise writing and expressing your 	thoughts clearly so that you may learn to think clearly. And you 	must study some book of deep wisdom. Such a book is the Ramayana 	or the Gita. You have very straightforward nature and a 	strong moral character, and they

 I am very glad that you wrote the long letter. It will be enough for me if you and Lilavati only adjust yourselves to each other. It was certainly good that all the pent-up feelings came out that day.
 I followed what you have written about Mirabehn. If she had no shortcomings at all, she would be a saint. We should only see everybody's virtues. Is there anybody who has no shortcomings? We should not, therefore, even think about them. If we look at people's shortcomings only, we would be sure to go mad and be left alone in the world.
 I understand about Chiranjilal. If we bear in mind that we are servants, then anyone being a leader should not hurt us. We may not submit to anybody's order for our selfish interest, but for the sake of service we may make ourselves slaves of the whole world.

271,,"THE REED  V.
	 THE FOUNTAIN-PENlibtech_357_footnote","
  
 I  am  tempted  to  share  with  the  reader   the   following   letterlibtech_358_footnote
received by Mahadev Desai:
 Some time back in an article entitled “Wanted Rural-mindedness”, you recommended, as a step in that direction, the adoption of the reedpen in the place of the fountain-pen. I was struck by your argument, and after reading Bapu's interpretation of the A. I. V. I. A. membership pledgelibtech_359_footnote, I laid aside my fountain-pen and took to the reed, nine months back. I was not altogether unused to the reed-pen. After a month of baffling experience, however, I
 was again forced to return to the fountain-pen a sadder and a wiser man. The reasons which compelled the change were as follows:
  It 	took three hours to 	copy out 	matter, using a 	reed-pen, that could be 	done with 	the fountain-pen 	in one hour 	and a half. 	. .  It 	took at 	least from a 	quarter of 	an hour to 	three quarters of 	an hour to 	mend one reed-pen by means of an indigenous village knife. . .  The 	fountain-pen enables 	you to make short 	jottings and 	entries, so 	indispensable in 	the course 	of village 	work, while standing, or 	while you 	are on the 	move. When I 	reverted to 	the use of 	the reed-pen, 	I invariably 	found that my 	diary- writing and maintanance of other daily records and registers fell heavily into arrears. . 
 .
 Surely, it is no part of the policy of the A.I.V.I.A. to slave-drive its workers to the very limit of their capacity . . .
 At the same time it would be unconscionable to go on using the fountain-pen in the teeth of the clear injunction of the A.I.V.I.A. . . . .
 As I write this another argument occurs to me. Perhaps you will find it to be specious as the preceding ones. Bapu welcomes the Singer machine as an aid to the tailer's needle; why should he not extend the same welcome to other domestic tools and appliances that are no  less helpful to  the   individual  householder	The
 A.I.V.I.A. does not oppose the use of the plough, the spinning-wheel and the fly shuttle loom in the place respectively of the hoe, the takli and the old-fashioned simple pit loom by the cultivator if he feels so inclined. Why stop at that and interdict the use, further, of more advanced and efficient appliances of a like nature? Is not your insistence on the use of the inefficient and fragile reed-pen in the place of a metal nib of a piece with asking people in this age of iron and electricity to discard
 
 here.
 all iron instruments and revert to primitive stone ones instead? You have applied yourself to the task of improving village tools. I would like you to suggest the nature and extent of the improvements which you would like to see effected.
 The above letter is written partly in jest, partly in earnest and partly as a dialectical exercise for its own sake in which the writer obviously luxuriates. His whole argument boils down to this that modern appliances are capable of more speed then their earlier prototypes. If the consideration of speed were ruled out, there would hardly be left anything from his argument for me to answer. But the village movement, as I conceive it, does not discount speed or efficiency of production. Our village folk need all the efficiency that we can give them and more. The A.I.V.I.A. is doing its level best to increase the speed of production consistently with its ideal and self- imposed limits. Already the speed of the takli has been-increased beyond the wildest expectations of its protagonists. But this was achieved without the slightest sacrifice of the principle of ruralmindedness. More, I claim that the marvellous ingenuity and skill which rendered this possible could only spring from a village brain. The limiting principle that was kept in view in effecting improvement in the speed of the takli , the spinning-wheel and other domestic tools should hold good in respect of the writing pen too. The rush and hurry of the town have no place in the village. The village-dweller has not to work under high pressure or to speed about from place to place in motor cars and trams like the city dwellers. All this work is done by the easier and more natural modes of locomotion. Similarly the fountain-pen can have no place in his economy. I might, perhaps, reluctantly go so far as to admit the steel nib as a compromise, but that is all. The steel nib in my opinion has spelt the death of the calligraphist's art the mending of a reed-pen was itself an art. It called into play the artistic skill and the personality of the scribe that was reflected in the characters which he traced. All that has gone with the advent of the steel pen. But the steel pen has not done even half the mischief that the fountain-pen is doing. The introduction of the fountain-pen in the village, to me, marks the beginning of the end of the existence of the village as such and its slow metamorphosis into the city.
 The analogy of the Singer machine v. the tailor's needle adduced by the writer is misleading. The Singer machine was intended to supplement the work of the needle. It was never intended to be introduced into every hut and home. The purpose which it was calculated to serve and which it has actually served is to increase the speed of the individual needle to such an extent as to make hand- stitching a profitable whole-time avocation for the needy, unemployed
 of the cities. The fountain-pen has rendered an analogous service to the art of stenography, and as such it can certainly claim a place as a useful adjunct of city life.
 The argument that I have used in connection with the fountain- pen applies mutatis mutandis to the other points raised by the correspondent in question. Clearly it is not possible to lay down hard and fast rules in all such cases. Let everybody strive to cultivate and practise the principle of rural-mindedness as best as he or she can. Only let the worker from the city who goes out to work in the villages take care that he does not turn the heads and confuse the intelligence of the simple-minded village folk, whom ostensibly he is anxious to serve but whose requirements and standards of values and utility are altogether different from that of the city-dweller.

 You have started thinking on the right lines. Continue to write to me as much as you wish. The two difficulties which you have mentioned are real, but only in the sense that they may hinder
 
 creation of family spirit. However, I am sorry that the inmates at Segaon do not regard the world as one family. For a devoted servant of the people such a feeling is essential. Those in whom it is born are seen bahaving with a family spirit wherever they go, although the other people might be utter strangers to them and all of them might have different spheres of activity. Moreover, family spirit does not require mutual co-operation. Among members of the same family, some may be so straightforward by nature that they live in harmony with other members of the family who are curt. There is truth in your complaint that Segaon has become a dharmashala. But what can I do? I feel helpless. Although I keep off many, there are some whom I simply cannot. But I do hope that we shall succeed in cultivating a family spirit in Segaon. If we do not succeed, then it is certain that we will be able to achieve nothing at Segaon. I will, of course, be vigilant myself and also keep a watch on all others. But the result will depend on the joint efforts of us all.

 MY DEAR AGATHA,
Your letter has just come. And I hasten to answer.
 Could I be more definite than when I said if Mr. Butler and Lord Zetland meant what the papers made out they did, why not straightway give the assurances in terms of the (Congress) resolution? I have now gone a step further and said in so many words that when there is an emergency dismiss the Ministers.
 The Bombay Governor's speechlibtech_365_footnote, as I read it, is a denial of what Lord Zetland is supposed to have yielded in his recent speechlibtech_366_footnote. You must have seen the text.
 And why is my remark on complete independence a knotty point? Is it not in the Congress creed? Is it not in the very resolution which was shown to the Governors and to which they raised no objection?
 Perhaps you do not know the difficulties we have to combat here. It is impossible to have mental reservations when you have millions of mankind to deal with, especially when you are training them not for an armed rebellion but for a peaceful revolution as yet unknown to history. I want you therefore not to be agitated over what the diplomats say there or here. Your and my first and last care is to hold on to the anchor at all costs but say nothing in anger, nothing equivocal, nothing short of the whole truth and then leave the result to the unseen and uncanny Power that over-rules all our pet decisions at Its own sweet will.

I write not a line without deep conviction. Zetland gave me some hope, Bombaylibtech_367_footnotehas shattered it if what he says is what Zetland meant. But my conviction about the rightness of our position grows with their double-dealing. I would far rather cancel our resolution and accept office without any condition than accepting office under the delusion that Zetland's speech with Butler's annotation was a near enough response to our resolution. Of course my conviction abides that unconditional acceptance would be fatal. The other would be still more so. The only honourable course therefore is to remain as we are till we get what we want and in the manner we want it. But if all this sounds hopelessly unreal to you, you should resist me for my sake and what is more for the sake of the cause.

  	There is a letter from Anna today in which again I read about your 	keeping bad health. You should leave off eating wheat, etc., for a 	few months. For a few days you should give up even milk. Put mud- 	packs on the abdomen and take hip-baths. Take as much rest as you 	wish but improve your health anyhow. Why don't you listen to me in 	such a simple matter?  	I hope you do not worry about anything now and have made friends 	with all. Never mind if you cannot attend prayers. Sleep well.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 9360.

Make whatever changes in your diet you think might 	help. Reduce your work. If this does not help, then go to some cool 	place. If you think it desirable to go to Malad, you may come back 	when the rains start. If your health is good, I will get plenty of 	work out of you.

  	Your letter. Yes, the sea breezes are fine. I wish you were here to 	share them. We walk through the sea water every morning and  	evening. It is a bracing walk. Kanu the little one enjoys it most. 	We are almost 25 strong now. And presently we shall perhaps double 	the record. Tithal is a little village. It has only a few bungalows. 	We are in Bhulabhai's. He has hired another to take in the overflow. 	He bears all the expenses. I expect to leave this on 30th. I do not 	mind the Seagon heat. I must not absent myself for any length of 	time.  	I am glad you were able to make a collection from the Club for 	Harijans. Of course, the principal portion should go to the Harijans 	and khadi. But I know you cannot, may not, force the pace.  	This suppuration of the toe I do not like. Nevertheless, it is good 	that the poison is coming out. Are you having the hip-baths? What 	about the friction-baths? I wish you could master them and do them 	correctly. Are you continuing garlic? What about onion? No fried  	things I hope. And about dallibtech_368_footnote? Even a spoonful is poison for you.

 CHI. CHIMANLAL,
 I have been meaning to write to you all these days but in the mean time I got your letter today. Sharda is fine. For the present she seems to be happy. If she can stay with me cheerfully, I am ready to relieve you of your responsibility regarding her. I will fix her up where and when I think proper. She will stay with me, of course, till she recoups her health. I will give her whatever treatment I deem fit. Just now she says she is quite ready to stay with me. She also says that both you and Shakaribehnlibtech_369_footnotelibtech_370_footnoteare ready to entrust her to me. She had not told me that she was suffering from leucorrhoea. She felt shy. It seems to have become chronic. But I think it can be cured. It will take time though. I also understand about her marriage. I have been thinking about the matter ever since she told me  about  it.  But marriage is out of the question till her health improves. I would favour marrying her outside the caste and, if possible, even outside the Province. But that remains to be seen. Sharda herself is ready for this and she says that both of you also will be ready. So much about Babulibtech_371_footnote
 . Now regarding you two. Babu is 20; but in some matters she is wiser than her age. She seems to be much concerned for you both. You have–Shakariben has–Rs. 3,000 and it is on that that you live at present. I do not mind that. You need not worry even  after  that amount is spent. You ought not to care so much for possessions. But since you have the money, let it remain. I would not mind if, despite your having that money, you earn more somewhere by honest means. But so long as you have it, it would be more becoming of you both to do public work without accepting anything. But this is my personal view. If it does not apeal to you, you may certainly follow another path.
 Babu also told me that Vijapur did not suit you and that you wished to go somewhere else. When I mentioned Rajkot, she said that that was the last place you would like to go to. The reason, that the estrangement between Narandas and you still persists, pains me. Being inmates of the Ashram, you two should be more than blood-brothers to each other. You ought to overcome your mutual antipathy. I am sure that there is no deeper cause behind it. You both  have  no personal interest to serve. Why this enmity, then? Hence, whatever disagreement you have must be one of principles only. Why be afraid
 
 
 of such disagreement? If you wish, I may go deeper into the cause of this disagreement. Whether you go to Rajkot or not, your antipathy to each other must end.
 Babu says further that you prefer your own place. I  think nothing would be better than that, if you could settle down there. If you stay there, the expenditure also would be less and you could serve the village more easily. If, therefore, you can decide to stay in your village, you should do so.
 If you wish, you may come and see me after the 25th. I shall leave this place for Wardha on the 30th. Don't worry at all about Babu.

DEAR DR. GODBOLE,
 
 
 TITHAL, BULSAR,
 MAY 20, 1937
  	I have now gone through your book carefully. It is good so far as it 	goes. Its price is prohibitive. You have gone beyond the scope of 	the book which its title suggests but the chapters are scrappy. Thus 	your examination of vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods reproduces 	authorities quoted in vegetarian literature and contains nothing 	original. I should expect an original contribution from an Indian 	scholar. Then the chapter on breeding and feeding is very 	superficial. Dairy experts tell me that breeding is the only thing. 	Feeding is said to produce little impression on the milk yield. I 	miss a chapter on comparison between buffalo and cow. Can both be 	supported? Which is the more economical animal? As you may be aware, 	separated milk is being widely recommended by Dr. Aykroydlibtech_376_footnote. But I do not find in your book enough instruction 	as to the ways in which it can be used. I am myself making 	experiments within the limits of a villager and had hoped to find 	assistance in your book. Nor have you examined the indigenous 	methods of using milk. "

  	I got your letter only this morning. Whose fault is it if I get your 	letters late and then in spite of my replying by return of post you 	also got my letters late? You yourself had asked for permission to 	live in a village, which I gave. What more could you do than riding, 	serving Harijans, lightening the burden of the poor and helping in 	digging wells? So I readily consented. But I would certainly like it 	even if you went to the frontier and did something similar. I had to 	leave for Allahabad suddenly, for since Jawaharlal was ill the 	Working Committee could not be held anywhere else and they required 	my presence.  	At Sardar's insistence, I am staying in a village called Tithal on 	the sea coast near Bulsar. I am accompanied by Ba, Mirabehn and     
 others. I expect to return to Wardha on the 1st.
 Why should asthma and cough trouble you even in such a dry climate as you have there? I hope you will have recovered by the time you get this letter, since I got your letters long ago.

COCHIN","
    
 The reader will find elsewhere an authentic and exhaustive notelibtech_384_footnoteon the Koodalmanikkam controversy prepared by Shri G. Ramachandran, Secretary of the Kerala Harijan Sevak Sangh.  The note is authentic in the sense that it is based purely on official records. Add to this note the following from the Kerala Harijan Sevak Sangh's office in Trivandrum:
 In the issue of Harijan of 8th May in the article, ""Cochin-Travancore""libtech_385_footnoteby Mahatmaji, in paragraph three, the following sentences are found:
 ""The pundits of India should dispassionately examine the orders and express
 their unbiased opinion. I am inclined to think that the Travancore Durbar may well invite the opinion of pundits on the single question of the religious propriety of the Cochin order and undertake to abide by their opinion. In other words, Travancore may well offer to abide by the verdict of an arbitration tribunal consisting of unbiased pundits who will be universally accepted as such. The opinion of an assembly of such pundits would be the nearest approach to an arbitration tribunal. For, whilst the Travancore Durbar had a perfect right to open to Harijans the temples within their sole jurisdiction and ownership and without reference to the opinion of pundits, it would hardly be right to propound a new Smriti in respect of temples where there is joint jurisdiction.""
 I am herewith forwarding a true copy of a judgment of the Chief Court of Cochin which discusses the Kaimal's position with regard to the Koodalmanikkam Temple. This judgment shows the Kaimal to be the supreme spiritual authority in all matters connected with that Temple, and therefore the opinion of the pundits in this instance seems to be unnecessary.
 These enable the reader to form his own judgment as to the propriety or otherwise of the action of the Cochin Durbar. If the note and the Cochin Court judgment are to be trusted, evidently the Cochin Durbar's action was wholly wrong. This is not to say that the Kaimal's action was right in the religious sense. But if it was not, the only course open to the Cochin Durbar was to reason with the Kaimal, notKaimal, not to force his hands as was done. The Kaimal evidently becomes the supreme and final authority on spiritual matters after his appointment by the Travancore Durbar. Like the king he can do no wrong. But even he may not long resist the opinion of his peers. And the only way the Cochin Durbar or anyone else can influence the
 
 Kaimal’s judgment is, I presume, by evoking the opinion of pundits learned in spiritual matters. And legally speaking even their opinion has no binding effect on the Kaimal.

 "
304,,RELIGIOUS OATH AND NON-RELIGIOUS,"
    
 Shri Shivaprasad Gupta, the great philanthropist of Benares, writes:
 After hearing the Harijan of May 1st read to me, I have been pondering over the note “Gandhi Seva Sangh and Legislatures”. I reread it today, I also read the Weekly Letter, but I could not give rest to the surging thought rising in my mind.
 The last paragraphlibtech_386_footnoteof the note reads: “It is not a religious oath, so far  as I understand the Constitution, and it is wholly consistent with the demand for immediate and concrete independence."" The following are the questions that arise in my mind:
 Are 	oaths of several and different kinds?  Can 	an oath 	taken in the 	name of 	God, or 	in the alternative 	form where 	one has to 	affirm solemnly, 	be classed 	in two 	categories, “religious 	oath and 	non-religious oath”? What 	is the 	governing idea behind a 	non-religious oath?  How 	can an oath 	of allegiance 	to the 	person of 	a king be 	consistent with 	“the demand for 	immediate and 	concrete independence”? 	This demand, at least to me, means depriving the same sovereign of his sovereignty. 
 I would very much like your answer to these pertinent questions.
 My answer to the first and the second questions is ‘Yes’. The answer to the other two questions may be gathered from what  follows.
 An oath may be taken in the name of God and yet may not be styled religious. An oath that a witness takes in a court of law is a legal not a religious oath, breach of which would carry legal consequences. An oath taken by Members of Parliament may be called a constitutional not a religious oath, breach of which may involve mundane consequences. Breach of a religious oath carries no legal consequences, but in the opinion of the taker does carry divine punishment. This does not mean that any of the three varieties of oaths is less binding than the others on a conscientious man. A conscientious witness will tell the truth, not for fear of the legal consequence, but he will do so in every case. The legislator's oath has
 
 an interpretation in terms of the Constitution which prescribes the oath. The interpretation may be given in the Constitution itself or may grow up by usage. So far as I understand the British Constitution, the oath of allegiance simply means that the legislator will in pushing forward his policy or point conform to the Constitution. I hold that it is open to the legislator consistently with his oath under the British Constitution to adopt measures in the Legislature for complete independence. That to my mind is the saving grace of the British Constitution. I fancy that the members of the Union Parliament of South Africa take substantially the same oath as the members in India, but it is open to that Parliament today to declare complete independence without any violation of the oath of allegiance. It is because I have a profound conviction that the British Constitution in theory permits of the fulfilment of the highest ambition of an individual or the nation of which he is a member that I advised the Workiing Committee to accept my formula  for  office-acceptance. And it is in the same conviction that I am struggling to get the British Government to respond to it. I am painfully conscious that they would prolong the agony to the breaking point. But I know that if we have faith and grit we shall win at every point and reach our goal without shedding a drop of blood. The British people apply the same laws to the game of politics that they apply to the game of football which I believe is their invention. They give no quarter to the opponent and ask for none. The fundamental difference in our case is that we have abjured the use of arms. This has confounded them. They do not believe our protestations. They do not mind our  agitation  for complete independence so long as we keep it within the constitutional limit. What else can the legislators do or are they to do inside their Assemblies? They may not take there pistols in their pockets. That would be a flagrant breach of the oath and also the law. Shri Shivaprasad Gupta need not worry himself over the propriety of the oath by Congressmen. If the agitation for complete independence was inconsistent with the oath, surely the British Government themselves would have raised that preliminary objection even to the candidature of Congressmen.

Before you consult the Committee it might be as well to ascertain 	from the Government whether the delivery of the buildings is to mean 	the lifting of the ban on the Dal. By the time the possessions is 	taken,      
 Jawaharlal will have returned and he will decide what use to make of the buildings.libtech_390_footnote
I hope you are throughly restored to health.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I got your letter. Don't ruin your health. It is good that you paid 	a visit to Hazaribagh. Sardar took it for granted that prisoners 	sentenced to short terms would be released.  	I didn't send for you at Allahabad because I thought Jaya- prakash 	might not like it. I would not like to displease him unnecessarily. 	I consider it my duty to respect his wishes as far as possible.  	It is quite proper that you should stay with Father as long as you 	can. You will certainly be a great help to him. You should give him 	courage and tell him that he should not at all worry. You should 	also try to understand why he keeps worrying.  	Why have they called you to Sitab Diara? Is Sitab Diara hotter or 	cooler? In which of the two places can you have greater facility 	regarding vegetables? Manu has now gone to Rajkot. In Segaon, only 	Vasumati, Vijaya, Lilavati, Nanavati, Munnalal and Balvantsinha are 	left now. It is quite hot there.

 MAY 22, 1937
 If we want to impart education best suited to the needs of villagers, we should take the Vidyapith to the villages. We should convert it into a training school in order that we might be able to give practical training to teachers in terms of the needs of villagers. You cannot instruct the teachers in the needs of villagers through a training school in a city. Nor can you so interest them in the condition of villages. To interest city-dwellers in villages and make them live in them is no easy task. I am finding daily confirmation of this in  Segaon. I cannot give the assurance that our year's stay in Segaon has
 
  The 	need of making 	vocational training the 	pivot of all 	instruction. 5. 	The future of 	the present 	national schools. 6. The 	possibility of 	imparting all 	education through 	the mother 	tongue of the 	children. 7. 	In what essentials 	of national 	education are existing 	schools lacking? 8. The 	necessity of 	making Hindi-Hindustani 	compulsory in 	the early 	years of primary 	and secondary 	education.' On Gandhiji 	being invited to give 	his views on these 	points, he 	made observations 	giving individual examples. I 	epitomize them below 	leaving out the latter, 	which while they were interesting to 	the few friends to whom he spoke are of little use to the general reader."" 
 made of us villagers or that we have become one with them for common good.
 Then as to primary education my confirmed opinion is that the commencement of training by teaching the alphabet and reading and writing hampers their intellectual growth. I would not teach them the alphabet till they have had an elementary knowledge of history, geography, mental arithmetic and the art (say) of spinning. Through these three I should develop their intelligence. Question may be asked how intelligence can be developed through the takli or the spinning- wheel. It can be, to a marvellous degree, if it is not taught merely mechanically. When you tell a child the reason for each process, when you explain the mechanism of the takli or the wheel, when you give him the history of cotton and its connection with civilization itself and take him to the village field where it is grown, and teach him to count the rounds he spins and the method of finding the evenness and strength of his yarn, you hold his interest and simultaneously train his hands, his eyes and his mind. I should give six months to this preliminary training. The child is probably now ready for learning how to read the alphabet, and when he is able to do so rapidly, he is ready to learn simple drawing, and when he has leant to draw geometrical figures and the figures of birds, etc., he will draw, not scrawl, the figures of the alphabet. I can recall the days of my childhood when I was being taught the alphabet. I know what a drag it was. Nobody cared why my intellect was rusting. I consider writing as a fine art. We kill it by imposing the alphabet on little children and making it the beginning of learning. Thus we do violence to the art of writing and stunt the growth of the child when we seek to teach him the alphabet before its time.
 Indeed in my opinion what we have reason to deplore and be ashamed of is not so much illiteracy as ignorance. Therefore adult education, too, should have an intensive programme of driving out ignorance through  carefully selected teachers with an equally carefully selected syllabus according to which they would educate the adult villager's mind. This is not to say that I would not give them a knowledge of the alphabet. I value it too much to despise or even belittle its merit as a vehicle of education. I appreciate Prof. Laubach's immense labours in the way of making the alphabet easy and Prof. Bhagwat's great and practical contribution in the same  direction. Indeed I have invited the latter to come to Segaon whenever  he chooses and try his art on the men, women and even children of Segaon.
 As to the necessity and value of regarding the teaching of  village handicrafts as the pivot and centre of education I have no
 
 manner of doubt. The method adopted in the institutions in India, I do not call education, i.e., drawing out the best in man, but a debauchery of the mind. It informs the mind anyhow, whereas the method of training the mind through village handicrafts from the very beginning as the central fact would promote the real, disciplined development of the mind resulting in conservation of the intellectual energy and indirectly also the spiritual. Here, too, I must not be understood to belittle fine arts. But I would not misplace them. Matter misplaced has been rightly described as dirt. In proof of what I am saying, I can only cite the tons of worthless and even  indecent  literature that is pouring in upon us with the result which he who runs may see.

310,,REGISTER OF CUSTOMERS,"
  
Shri Jerajani writes to say:libtech_392_footnote
 This suggestion is worth considering, and if a register of customers is maintained at each centre, it is likely to prove useful. The only doubt may be regarding its feasibility. I would regard it as practical if a complete list could be compiled speedily and at little additional cost. A list of workmen poses no difficulties. And, ordinarily it may be said that those workmen who are once registered continue to work for good. But customers keep changing every day. It cannot be said with certainty that the individual who  purchases khadi worth one anna today is bound to come back for more. However, if the list is to be complete, even such a customer's name must be recorded. What is its utility? If a list is to be compiled, should it consist only of customers of a certain kind? In order that such a list should prove useful, it should be maintained in alphabetical order. If this is attempted, it will necessarily entail some expenses. Should a list then be made of those who give a certain yearly subscription? If this be the case, what benefit do they get out of it? As I have no experience in this matter, I can only frame such questions. Shri Jerajani's suggestion has been published here in order to invite discussion.

 Harijanbandhu, 23-5-1937
 
 
  "
311,,VERY OLD QUESTIONS,"
  
I have received a letter. Its substance is as follows:
 Our country does not manufacture any dyes. But the khadi sold in our country comes in many coloured prints. Obviously the dyes used could only be foreign. I cannot understand how we can tolerate it. India can certainly manufacture its own dyes. Why then foreign chemical dyes on a sacred thing like khadi? For patriotic reasons khadi is of course best for  wearing for Indians but why shouldn't it be as fine as muslin? There was a time when India used to produce muslin for the entire world.
 All these three questions were discussed at length when  Navajivan was first started. Ordinarily such questions are not raised these days. As the correspondent desires that replies should be given only through the columns of the Harijanbandhu, I give these here.
 Ever since I accepted khadi as the focal-point of swadeshi in the year 1918, I have been repeatedly saying that we should keep the pledge of swadeshi not because we hate what is foreign but because the welfare of the country is rooted in swadeshi. Hence we should certianly accept those foreign products which we cannot produce immediately, which are needed by the country and the introduction of which would not harm the country in any way. Everyone can think of examples of such foreign goods. Regarding the propagation of khadi, the question of using [foreign] dyes arose at the very outset. The Spinners' Association did not exist at that time. I  had  given  the opinion that wherever indigenous dyes were not available, there should be no bar to using foreign ones. But the utmost effort should be made for producing the best possible indigenous dyes. The same policy continues even now. Experiments with indigenous dyes are being made and they are being used whenever it is convenient to do so. The needs of those who would not use foreign dyes are met by white khadi. The propaganda for khadi is not for its own sake, nor is it unthinking. The following is the trend of thought behind the khadi shastra. If Indians use nothing but khadi, crores of women spinners, carders, washermen, dyers and such other persons could get a livelihood; and crores of rupees will remain in the country and go into the pockets of half-starved and wholly or partially unemployed
 
 villagers. The Spinners’ Association by investing a negligible amount of capital has to date put almost three and a half crores of rupees into the pockets of such artisans. Had these earnings gone to a hundred or two or even ten or twenty thousand persons in cities, it would have been announced by the beating of drums. But no one is surprised because this amount has found its way without any fanfare, into the homes of hundreds of thousands of starving villagers. But I regard it as a minor miracle. No one is deprived of his livelihood by the use of foreign dyes, no new industry is prevented from coming up because of this and khadi has been given an impetus. I  do  believe  that chemical dyes can be made in India but that is a distinct and independent industry. However, it is the dharma of the wealthy to take up that venture. Such risks are beyond the scope of a khadi worker.
 Even today mill-like khadi is produced in sufficient quantity to meet the demand. Even the  patolaslibtech_393_footnoteof Patan are available today if anyone wished to wear them. But there are few such generous persons who would pay the price. If anyone expects that the same quality of khadi should be available at a price comparable to mill-made mull, I would tell him that it is impossible, and it should be impossible, to have hand-made mull without the use of force against the workmen.

            DEAR 	MR. LATTHE,         TITHAL, BULSAR,  May 	26, 1937 
  	It was good of you to write to me. My later statements do not in any 	shape or form alter my position. The formula about dismissal was 	enunciated in answer to the question as to how I would envisage    
 interference by the Governors, since I admit that circumstances could be conceived when intereference would be necessary, if the clause defining special powers of Governors was not abrogated. I then said that I did not contemplate an irremovable Ministry except by an adverse vote of the House, but that I contemplated also dismissal byGovernors when a difference arose between them and their Ministers, which could not be got over by any reasoning. I perferred dismissal to voluntary resignation becuase I wanted the burden of dismissal to rest on Governor’s shoulders. That would check or minimize opposition pinpricks and make the working of offices by a party which is frankly opposed to the Act and the British Imperial system tolerably smooth. Now, if the difference between dismissal and what Lord Zetland has offered is very little, surely it is up to the Government to make up the difference rather than for the Congress to yield. To show that my original position is not [at] all altered, I would be entirely satisfied if assurances were given as was contemplated by the resolution of the A. I. C. C. The latest resolution  of  the  Working Committee is but an interpretation of the A. I. C. C. resolution, not an advance or impro-vement on it. I hope that this letter clears up all the points raised in your letter; but if there is anything more, please do not hesitate to write to me.

 [After  May 26, 1937]libtech_406_footnoteRevered Bapuji’s instructions are that if the thread snaps while spinning it  should be joined rather than thrown away. It will lessen the wastage. The best thing would be to spin in such a way that there would be no occasion for joining. Usually the thread snaps only because of its unevenness. There will not be any wastage if as soon as the thread becomes thinner than usual, the sliver is broken off and put along
 with the thin thread and spun again. Professional spinners follow this method.

  	You have given your daily programme in sufficient detail. It is 	fine. It is through selfishness that you are grieving over 	grandmother’s death. Her house had become dilapidated. Should she, 	even then, continue to stay in it merely for serving  others?  Why  	should you envy her if she goes to live in a new house? Just because 	we do not know the meaning of death, through our selfishness we 	grieve over it. If you understand this simple truth, then you will 	give up crying.  	I have had two letters from Manubhai. I have preserved them for you. 	I intended to show them to you when I return there. But if you have 	lost patience, then let me know and I shall send them immediately by 	return of post. I have presumed that you are not impatient in such 	matters.

You have yourself understood my helplessness and 	thereby proved the justice of your criticism.  	What does Balvantsinha write about milk? I think that he should be 	given as much separated milk for the cows as he needs. What could be 	your reason for refusing? It is certainly good that the he-goat was 	saved.

 The relations with Jamnalalji and his house [at Segaon] should be no obstacle. It all depends on the manner in which we use them. We do hope that we shall always use them for a good purpose.

 I got your long letter. I have read it carefully. Deka also met me. I think he is a nice young man. There seems to be nothing wrong in what he has written and what he believes. So there is no need to harp on it. If he himself comes to work among the labourers, he would like to work in the labour office for a minimum of three months. Your need at present appears to be urgent as Raghunandan requires assistance in the Press. But in my opinion you should let Deka gain full experience. He will then be more useful.
 Satyavati’s case is pitiable. She mentions her weaknesses; what are they precisely? The help granted to her for her convalescence is quite proper. But it is difficult to say how far you are qualified to guide her. Know that it all depends on your self-confidence. I am quite partial to her, but she is as wilful as she is courageous.

340,,LATHI’S EXAMPLE,"
  
 The reader will find a fair notice in Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter” of the opening to Harijans of its important temple by the ruler of Lathi State. The event is of great value to Kathiawar. And Thakoresaheb Prahladsinghiji deserves the congratulations of all lovers of Hinduism and humanity. Published reports show that there was not a murmur against the act and that the savarna Hindus partook in the proceedings without any reserve. I draw from this the same inference I drew from the Travancore Proclamation. For the people religious proclamations of a ruler have the sanction of Smritis. I am unable on any other basis to account for the unanimous welcome extended to the generous action of the Thakoresaheb of Lathi. I have bitter experiences of the obstinacy of the savarnas of Lathi. They would not come to the Harijan quarters. There was  difficulty in getting medical attendance for a Harijan woman who was dying of
 
 pneumonia. There were distinctions observed at the State dispensary. It must be said in passing that these disabilities were not peculiar to Lathi, they were common to all parts of Kathiawar and outside it in Gujarat. Indeed in some vital matters untouchability is worse in Gujarat than elsewhere and worst in Kathiawar. Nor do I imagine that with the opening of the temple in Lathi all the disabilities have disappeared in practice. Nevertheless in the ready co-operation of the savarna Hindus in the worthy action of the Thakoresaheb of Lathi, as in Travancore, one finds a quick solution of the untouchability problem. For if my reasoning is sound, the other Indian chiefs have but to copy the examples of Travancore and Lathi and untouchability will lose its sharp edge, even though it may not die out altogether inthe States of India. And if it does on that large scale, British India cannot but be affected by the phenomenon. One fails to see, why the princes move so slowly in this matter which is one of life and death to a large portion of Hindu humanity. Would that the princes recognized their obvious duty of purging Hinduism of the virus of untouchability and took timely action.
 The Thakoresaheb of Lathi is reported to have said in  his address that as soon as he gets suitable priests and teachers he would like to open more temples and cover them with schools for all classes of children. I would suggest to him the same remedy I put before the authorities in Travancore. A small training schoold should be opened in Lathi for giving practical training in conducting services and  schools in temples. There is no reason why both the offices should not be combined in one person. A school master has as much need to be pure in heart as a priest and vice versa. Nor need a priest be ignorant of the art of teaching. At the present moment the most deplorable thing is that the temple priests are as a rule ignorant men often devoid of character. The training course need not be long–not beyond six months. If the salaray offered is attractive, the school should draw well-read youths of character beyond reproach. My suggestion no doubt implies that the reform of Lathi has its root in spirituality.

So I expect you in July and thereafter you will take your 	seconds, minutes or hours whatever you can get and have advice, 	guidance, and orders at your wish!  	Yes, Kumarappa does feel that his interpretation was right and mine 	wholly wrong and misleading and when he told me that Bahadurji had 	agreed with him, I told him I must have his opinion in writing.

I had pure love for my mother, but 	Iused to massage her legs when they ached. There was no impurity in 	that touch. Touch prompted by lust is evil. I would, therefore, say 	that anybody who says that pure love is impossible without touch 	doesn’t know what pure love is.  	I still do not understand what you wish to suggest regarding 	Nariman. Who did him injustice and how? At least for the sake of 	truth you should come out frankly with what you have in mind. I find 	it intolerable that there should be a difference of opinion between 	us in a matter like this. If you are convinced that injustice has 	been done to Nariman, you should prove that to me, for, though 	unwillingly, I had to interest myself in the affair. I have, 	moreover, assured Nariman that I shall be ready to study his case 	whenever he wishes. But whether or not he comes, your duty is clear.  	What you have  assumed  regarding  .  .  .libtech_424_footnoteis  not  correct.  The evidence which you have got 	is of no value. Before believing in such a thing you should ask the 	person concerned. I don’t wish to suggest that no such untruth has 	been practised. But the matter should be carefully investigated. If 	somebody tells me that Prema did a certain thing, should I believe 	it without asking you whether it is correct?  	Maybe what you said at Hudli came from your heart. But what you said 	in your speech was different from what you say now. Will you admit 	this much? Be that as it may, I have told you that my experience was 	different from your reasoning. You are certainly     
 entitled to attach more importance to your reasoning than to my experience. But what should I do?

It is possible that this will nullify our object in requiring everybody to pay subscription in the same form or some other object as well. We need not think that Kishorelal has committed any error because the way he looks at the matter differs from ours in accepting yarn as a form of subscription.
 I don’t see anything to criticize in what he has said regarding equal respect for all religions. If we see an error in any religion why shouldn’t we point it out when occasion demands? That we must make sure that the occasion is proper, is a different matter. If you have read any other meaning, let me know.

 "
350,"June 	1, 1937",INTERVIEW TO “THE TIMES OF INDIA”,"
        TITHAL, 
  June 	1, 1937  	I am very  anxious  that  Congressmen  should  take  office—  but 	only if Government show their willingness to conciliate the 	Congress.  	If, as has been said, Lord Zetland has conceded all but the question 	of dismissal, the Congress asks Government to come a little way to 	meet it. The conciliatory moves so far have come from the    
 Congress. It would have been easy at Allahabad to close the door by putting a narrow interpretation on the Delhi resolution. Instead it was kept open.
 The only obstacle, so far as can at present be seen, is  the Congress demand that in the event of serious disagreement between a Governor and his Congress Ministers, the Governor should dismiss them. I personally would be satisfied, however, if the Governor gave an undertaking that in such a case he would demand his Ministers’ resignation.
 Mr. Gandhi refused to agree that it was a small matter for the Congress, because his idea was to make the Governor think fifty times before he took the responsibility of dismissing his Ministers. In other words, Mr. Gandhi wished to “take advantage of the ordinary human virtue—it may be weakness—of not wishing  to look a fool”. Congress critics had said that this demand was merely a trifle. [Mr. Gandhi asked:]
If it is so, why not give the Congress the trifle?
 In any case, Mr. Gandhi affirmed, the object of the Congress demand was to test the sincerity of British Government. Did they want the Congress in office, or did they not? In South Africa, Britain meticulously conciliated the Boer. In India, however, such a gesture was lacking. Indeed all the moves towards solving the impasse had come from the Congress.
 Now the Congress did not demand any legal change. But it was being talked at instead of being talked to. It would appear that British statesmen and the provincial Governors were addressing the world and not the Congress. In fact, they might be accused of attempting as ever to discredit and isolate the Congress.
 If Congressmen took office, they would be doing so with a full sense of their responsibility. Therefore, unless the Government recognized its policy of wrecking the Act and achieving independence by constitutional means as perfectly legitimate, they would not welcome the rule of the Congress majority.
 Mr. Gandhi did not see any constitutional obstacle or impropriety in the Viceroy taking steps in an attempt to end the deadlock. It was known that the Viceroy had conferred with provincial Governors before they summoned the Congress leaders. Surely, then, there was no obstacle to his asking the Congress President to meet him. [Mr. Gandhi said:]
I do not say that this is necessary. It is enough if the Congress
 demand in  accordance  with  the  Allahabad  resolutionlibtech_428_footnoteis  complied with.
 If Government would not make a gesture, the deadlock must continue. The result might in the end be the application of Section 93, that is, the suspension of the
 
 democratic portion of of the new Constitution. Mr. Gandhi was prepared for that and its possible consequences. He preferred open oppression under a state of autocracy to veiled oppression of, and interference with, Congress Ministers. Though he was ready to face it, oppression was the last thing he desired. It would increase the existing bitterness and hatred between Britain and India. He himself would die in an effort to prevent the tragedy, but there must come a time when his effort would be fruitless. Mr. Gandhi concluded:
Nobody has yet said that the present Congress condition for
 accepting office is unconstitutional. The Congress had gone as far as it could, consistent with self-esteem and with its avowed object. The next move must come from the Government, if they really want the Congress to take office.

Joshi, Superintendent, Bhavnagar Durbar dairy, has been studying the cattle problem in India for the last 14 years, and has done some work towards the improvement of the indigenous breed of cows in Kathiawar. Bhavnagar State is sending him to Denmark and the U.S.A. to study genetics and animal husbandry, so that his knowledge may be used for the betterment of the cattle wealth in this country. I shall be grateful for any facilities or guidance that may be given to Mr. Joshi in the countries he is visiting for the first time in his life.

  	Congratulations. What a splinter!libtech_429_footnoteSo, my anxiety was justified and so is your idiocy. 	You won’t repeat the folly of disregarding pin- points. I hope 	when this reaches you, you would have recovered completely.    
 I understand your question about violence. Good results do not justify violence and they do not nullify the evil that violence works. It is not always possible to lay one’s hands on the evil that violence works. Thus it is not possible to weigh the evil wrought by hanging a murderer, though we may heave a sigh of relief when he is put out. Faith would be meaningless, if we were able always to account for everything. Have I understood your question correctly?
Love.

  	Indu has given me your letters. After reading them, I wonder whether 	to laugh, weep or be angry and I was inclined to do these things in 	that order and I finally decided not to do any of them. I could not 	follow what Indu told me orally, nor have I been able to judge whose 	fault it must have been.  	I hope to reach there on the 11th instead of the 12th. I shall 	listen to the story when I come there. Or perhaps by that time the 	cloud might have cleared. Therefore I wish to say nothing about the 	discord. Do what you can to settle it among yourselves. You have 	written to me saying that I have thrust on you the burden of winning 	over Lilavati, Balvantsinha and others. If I had put on you the 	burden of village service for which you and others are in Segaon, 	you would have been able to carry it. But this very distinction that 	you have made is not proper. We have resolved that village service 	is not different from overcoming anger, etc.The equation would be: 	To win over Lilavati and others is to overcoming anger and that is 	equal to serving the villages. But so long as you regard them as two 	separate things, they will remain so from your point of view. I 	have, however, solved this problem, too. As I have already told you 	and Balvantsinha, you can have separate arrangements for your meals, 	etc. You will have to deal only with me. You should spend all your 	time in the service chosen by you. After careful thinking, you 	rejected the suggestion. And I also see that you were right in doing 	so. Nobody has ever been able to serve by living in this manner. We 	are not born independent. From conception to death we are and will 	remain dependent  on others. But I will not go into all this 	philosophy here. We will discuss it when we meet and find time.  	You don’t have to think what your duty should have been as regards 	that goat.libtech_440_footnoteIt 	was simply obstinacy on your part. It is good if you can save even 	one goat by changing people’s ideas. But if you save a million 	goats without their approval, it is of no value. If at all it has 	any, it is almost nil. In fact you should apologize to the people     
 and tell them: ‘My duty was to explain to you your dharma and not threaten you with a fast. I, therefore, apologize to you for having held out such a threat. Though I will not go on a fast to stop you, still I will continue to tell you that it is an evil custom. And will go on trying to prove that with arguments.’
 I didn’t follow anything regarding Balvantrai. I will be able to do so only when I go over there.

       CHI. 	MUNNALAL,    June 	3, 1937 
  	Today I am trying to answer several letters of yours. Try to analyse 	and understand the reasons why you worry about Kanchan. She is now 	well settled and studies as much as she can. She couldn’t be in a 	better place than where she is at present. What then is the point    
 in worrying about her? Is it that you wish to live with her? If that is so, there is no real cause for your worry. It is simply a question of your desire. If you are trying to curb that desire, we should consider  whether you ought to do so.
 The villagers live on jowar and besanlibtech_445_footnotelibtech_446_footnote. You will never be able to copy them in that. One should know one’s limitations. Hence, the reasoning behind your decision to resume solid food is wrong. Whether from the economic or the moral point of view, which is economical in the long run for you—to eat solid food and fall ill or live on milk which is costlier and work regularly?
 There is only one golden key in being able to live a true life. One should plunge into whatever work of service comes to one unsought, surrendering everything to Shri Krishna, and being wholly engrossed in the work. Even the thoughts in one’s mind should be about how to complete the task and not whether the work is proper or not.
 That we have employed a Bhangi and are building a road is certainly a form of service. We are in a position to make people spend money in this way. If we don’t use our advantage we would prove ourselves fools. And, besides, the money is given by the zamindar. That we thus make him take interest in the village, though it be indirectly, is no small thing. We need not postpone the cleaning of a village and wait for the village people themselves to start doing something. If we can melt the heart of the zamindar in every village, our task would be made very much easier. However, we have to keep in view all the limbs of society and the limits of each would be the limits of our strength.
 My wish to live alone in Segaon did not mean that it was not possible to enlarge the field of service so long as other people lived there. I only wanted to see what one man could do, to see for my own sake whether I could carry on the work by myself. The plan could not be carried out and others joined me. I must then use their services and they should give them.
 The relations with Jamnalalji should not be allowed to become an obstacle. If they make us soft and comfort-loving, we would fall off like dried leaves, and that deservedly. If we think of nothing but service every hour of the day and strive to remain pure, people will understand us even though a multi-millionaire may be living with us.
 
 I see from your letters that you spend most of your time in dreaming, and that prevents your work from shining out. Your motive is pure, but you start running before you have learnt to walk and even while running you dream of flying. The result is that you not only do not run or fly but cannot even walk. During your illness you could somehow carry on your work, but can you be satisfied with that?
 I have now answered all your letters. I kept the letters in front of me and went on consulting them. I am sure you do not want me to reply sentence by sentence. The foregoing replies will help you to resolve all your difficulties. I would, however, advise you to stop thinking in this manner altogether and to complete fully whatever task you have undertaken. If you do so, all your problems will solve themselves by and by without any effort on your part and you will be filled with such happiness as you have never known before.

BHAI BHAGWANJI,
 How can I help it if you, though a lawyer, see the thing in an altogether wrong light and then are displeased with my actions? I can only put up with your displeasure. Please note that in none of the cases mentioned by you was I appointed an arbitrator. Should I have asked to be made one? It is possible that, if I ask for it, Devchandbhai, Narbheram and Prabhashankar would appoint me. But should I on that account become a judge? It is only in some exceptional cases that  I agree to become an arbitrator, and whenever I have done so I have given clearcut decisions. But it is outside my field to be an arbitrator. My special field is to find a solution by persuading the parties. But I do not always succeed in such efforts and, moreover, I have to take considerable pains. You should have compassion for me and not  put before me complicated cases. I would  have  to  spare  a lot of  time for them. How can I manage that? Hence I can only put up with your [harsh] opinion.

  	I had your letter. In this condition what can you do by staying 	therelibtech_451_footnote? How 	much can you do even for the spread of the charkha? One wonders 	whether your living there is the right thing from the point of view 	of service. Think carefully about this and let me know.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 6550      A 	Cochin correspondent writes:  I 	have just gone through 	your articlelibtech_452_footnote“Cochin-Travancore” 	in the Harijan, 	dated May 	8, 1937. 	I find 	that you have, 	perhaps unwittingly, done a 	distinct disservice to 	the cause of truth.  The 	controversy about the Koodalmanikkam Temple can in no sense be 	regarded as a war between light and darkness; at any rate, there is 	not the slightest intention among the people of Cochin to hug 	darkness as a virtue in itself, worth putting up a fight for.  You 	seem to be labouring 	under a 	misapprehension when 	you say that “even 	the most 	orthodox Hinduism would 	hardly permit him 	(the Cochin Maharaja) 	to regulate the private 	conduct of the visitors 	to  the  Cochin 	 temples. In 	no temple in 	India where Harijans are 	not permitted to 	worship are 	trustees authorized to 	scrutinize the 	actions of 	savarna Hindus 	who  are  entitled, as 	a matter 	of right, 	to visit 	the temples.” So 	far as 	the Cochin 	Government are 	concerned, they 	have not sought to 	regulate the “private  conduct” 	of visitors 	to Cochin 	temples. They have also not 	sought to 	exercise any 	scrutiny into 	the actions of 	savarna Hindus 	who are entitled, 	as a 	matter of 	right, to 	visit the temples.  What 	they have done is simply to declare as polluted, so far as Cochin 	temples are concerned, the tantris 	who have performed 	religious worship in the temples of Travancore thrown open to 	avarnas. 	There is no sort of ban     
 imposed on entry into Cochin temples of savarna Hindus who have
 worshipped in Travancore temples.
 Even this ban on tantris was imposed by Cochin not because of any spite or malice against a sister State, but solely at the instance of the vaideekans and vadhyars who, from time immemorial, have been recognized
 and acknowledged as spiritual directors in such matters.
 You observe that “in Cochin the Maharaja has interfered in respect of a temple over which he has no exclusive control. The Maharaja of Travancore, too, possesses substantial rights over the temple in question. The Cochin order is clearly an interference with that right.”
 History, tradition, usage, custom—all these point to the fact that, while the right of the Maharaja of Travancore in respect of the Koodalmanikkam Temple begins and ends with the nomination of a Thachudaya Kaimal, the Maharaja of Cochin has always exercised, as President of the Yogakkars, enormous powers with regard to its affairs, both spiritual and secular. The very fact that the present Kaimal, when the recent troubles arose, solicited advice and guidance from the Maharaja of Cochin shows conclusively enough that the “substantial rights” alleged to be possessed by Travancore do not include, at any rate, the right to have a voice in the adjudication of spiritual affairs relating to the temple.
 It may interest you, in this connection, to know that in a recent speech at Thiruvalla, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, the Dewan of Travancore, admitted that the Travancore Government had no complaint whatever to make in regard to what has happened in the Koodalmanikkam Temple. Is this not a proof that Travancore itself does not find any fault with the attitude of Cochin?
 Your suggestion that the opinion of pundits might be invited on the issues involved is certainly one that ought to commend itself to all. But how do you justify, I wonder, your appeal in the same breath to the people of Cochin to hold protest meetings against the order of the Maharaja and lead an agitation for throwing open all temples to Harijans? Why not wait till the pundits give their opinion at least?
 “Whilst the Travancore Durbar had a perfect right to open to Harijans the temples within their sole jurisdiction and ownership and without reference to the opinion of pundits, it would hardly be right to propound a new Smritiin respect of temples where there is joint jurisdiction. The Harijan cause must be always and everywhere above suspicion.”
 This is a perfectly sensible position to take up, and we in Cochin would certainly be glad if no attempt is made in Travancore “to propound a new Smriti in respect of temples where there is joint jurisdiction”.
 I gladly publish this letter. The order reffered to of the Mahar- aja of Cochin reads as follows:
 The Maharaja of Cochin is of opinion that proper purificatory ceremonies should be performed in the Koodalmanikkam Temple without any
 
 delay. His Highness considers that the temples has been polluted by entry into and participating in ceremonies by persons who have officiated in other temples where the entry of avarnas  has been allowed. The Maharaja of Cochin
 has now definitely ordered that any person who has taken part in the conduct of ceremonies in temples which have been polluted by the entry of avarnas thereby becomes polluted and loses the right to enter temples in Cochin until
 proper  prayashchittams   are  performed.   Such  persons   are  prohibited from
 entering temples, touching tanks and wells until they perform the required purificatory ceremonies.
My note was based upon a summary of the order above quoted.
 There is no mention in it of tantris. And are not tantris savarna Hindus? My contention was and is that savarna Hindus because they visit or officiate in temples visited by Harijans do  not  become Harijans. But I did err in thinking that the order applied to all savarna Hindus who had visited Travancore temples, whereas it is restricted to those who officiated at Travancore temples. Whilst, therefore, I gladly admit the error as to quantity, my argument remains unaffected. The Maharaja has surely extended the doctrine of untouchability by regarding savarnas as untouchables because they did not believe in untouchability.
 But   the   authentic   and   exhaustive   notelibtech_453_footnotelibtech_454_footnotesince   published   in Harijan disposes of most of the contentions of my correspondent. For, according to that note neither the Maharaja of Cochin nor of Travancore has any jurisdiction over the administration of the Koodalmanikkam Temple. When, therefore, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar said that Travancore had no complaint, he merely stated the legal position. The only party who has the right and whose duty it is to complain is the Thachudaya Kaimal. And one may hope that he will not rest content till he has secured complete freedom from interference with his exclusive right to regulate the admission of worshippers and officiating tantris.
 The correspondent has surely confused the issue by suggesting that my advice to the Hindus of Cochin to agitate for the throwing open of temples to Harijans is inconsistent with my proposal to refer to pundits the question of the legality of declaring, as the Cochin Maharaja’s order does, savarna Hindus as untouchables. And now that it is known that the Maharaja had no right to issue the order he did, the proposed reference becomes unnecessary except as an academic proposition.
 Harijan, 5-6-1937
 "
372,,SHAMEFUL IF TRUE,"
  
 Thakkar Bapa sends me the following statement which he received during his recent tour in the Nizam’s Dominions:
 About six months ago an event which took place at Karepally, Warangal District, Nizam’s Dominions, describes the methods adopted by the Christian missionaries to make conversions of Hindus and especially Harijans. Some days previous to the appointed date, the village teachers sent out news of the coming event into all the surrounding villages and made sure that the people of all castes of Hindus and especially Harijans were present on the occasion in large numbers. Then the pastor arrived at the place bringing with him a girl, about 12 years old, who he said would cure all that were presented to her of all sorts of diseases and also show them the real path of realization of God.
 The pastor then stood and said addressing those present: “You believe in gods who are dead and gone. Your Rama was born, behaved and acted like an ordinary mortal and then died. So was the case with Krishna also, who had many more vices to his credit. Here is before you a person who is the very incarnation of Christ. Christ is in her now, which fact you can verify yourself by being cured of your diseases at the mere touch of her hands. Why believe in gods who are past and no more effective? You should all believe in and follow the path of Jesus Christ who was born to Virgin Mary, preached the Gospel which leads to salvation, died outwardly but rose again on the third day to redeem the sinning millions of the world.”
 A subscription of one anna per head and two annas for a metal cross were charged. They were told that unless they wore the cross at all times and believed in the truth and efficacy of Christianity, there would not be any good effect in the case of diseased patients.
 This happened on two occasions. On the third occasion, the Secretary of the District Committee and friends visited them and told them that theycould preach their religion as they wanted to, but they should not wound the feelings of the people by repeating unpleasant things which were not true. The local police then stopped the proceedings fearing there might be breach of peace in
 the place.
 If it is true, it stands self-condemned. I would like the Mission concerned to investigate the complaint and throw light on it.

373,,LETTER TO MANILAL AND SUSHILA GANDHI,"
  
 TITHAL, BULSAR,
 June 3[5]libtech_455_footnotelibtech_456_footnote1937
 CHI. MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
 I have liked your letter. It is indeed true that my statements contain several implications. Therefore, the meaning that you have read is possible. But the statement also implies the other meaning that you have suggested. Truth need not be made bitter. Nor need it be embellished. If one person wounds another with a sword and a witness describes the incident, such description by itself is not bitter, though the consequences of the testimony may be bitter for the assailant. But that doesn’t make truth itself bitter. If, however, the description of the assault was full of exaggerations, we might say that truth had been made bitter. After saying this, I may add that if I had to make a choice, I would certainly prefer bitter truth to untruth agreeably. If, in trying to change bitter into agreeable language, you are likely to kill truth, you had better stick to bitter language.
 You have always been unlucky in the matter of helpers. You have never had a really good man. But you have got a good helper in Sushila. I wonder how you could have managed to pull on if you didn’t have her. Even from the point of view of self-interest, therefore, Sushila must improve her health with good food, exercise and water treatment.
 Mr. Kallenbach has at last arrived. He is fine. For the present he is here. Tithal may be described as a small village about six or seven furlongs from the sea-coast. We are staying in that village. We are leaving on the 10th and shall reach Segaon on the 11th.
 I have just got a letter from Harilal. I am enclosing it as a sample.
 I have gone through the Phoenix Trust. There is no need to make any changes in it. But if you have any suggestion to make, it can perhaps be carried out. So it is you who should draft something and send it to me, instead of my drafting anything. I had a talk with
 
 Kallenbach. He says that there is no need to make any changes in the trust-deed or to increase the number of trustees.

You are a 	man of boundless good fortune. I had discovered before your birth 	the special bond of love that bound your father closest among all 	the cousins to me.

How could I have, yielding to my love, 	gone there to be by his side? It was your dharma to be by his side 	and you, therefore, took my place. You did perfectly right in not 	forcing medicine into his mouth or permitting them to give him 	injections during the last hour to enable him to take a few more

 How jealous of you that while all of you experience heat you don’t want me to do that! I have made up my mind to return on the 11th. Generally it does not rain so early in Wardha and hence I will have some experience of the heat there.
 Since even those who hadn’t eaten food from our kitchen had vomiting, we should look for its cause in something other than the food. Probably it is water. Put some potassium permanganate in the well. Store boiled water as before and use it. It is also possible that the people had eaten more than they could digest in the excessive heat and that had caused the vomiting. We can find other such reasons also if we think about the matter carefully. For that, however, I will have to examine things on the spot. I postpone that till I return there.
 You have done well in closing the night-school for the present. If we attempt more than we can manage, we may do more harm than good.

378,,MY MISTAKE,"
  
 In the issue of Harijanbandhu dated 16th May, I have said in an article  entitled  “A   Moral  Dilemma”libtech_460_footnotelibtech_461_footnote,  that  amongst   South   Indian Brahmins the marriage of a maternal uncle to his niece is permissible, and so, too amongst Parsis and Muslims. Professor Balvantrai Thakorelibtech_462_footnotelibtech_463_footnotehas, in an interesting letter, corrected this error of mine. He points out that amongst the Brahmins of the South the children of a brother and sister are permitted to marry, but not a girl and her maternal uncle. Poet Chaman informs us that such an alliance is prohibited amongst Muslims. I am grateful to both these gentlemen for the correction. I was actually aware of such an alliance between the
 
 children of a brother and sister. And I regard it as unpardonable on my part to have come to the conclusion and to have made a categorical statement that an alliance would be permissible between a girl and her maternal uncle. I should have realized that  in  these matters presumptions such as mine have no place. If I presumed, I should have indicated the uncertainly. However, I categorically asserted something for which I had no actual evidence as if I had it. And, as a result, my fidelity to truth has been blemished. For this lapse I must beg forgiveness from readers. They will be generous  and forgive me, but my conscience will not forgive me so easily. From this mistake I learnt the lesson that one has to exercise great care before coming to certain conclusions. I shall henceforth try to be more careful to avoid such mistakes.libtech_464_footnote

391,"June 10, 1937","SPEECH ON COW-PROTECTION,
TITHALlibtech_486_footnote","
  
 [Before June 10, 1937]libtech_487_footnote
 The pity is that most of our cow-protection associations will keep cows and buffaloes both and try to run them and make them paying concerns by selling buffalo’s milk. The cow, they think, is uneconomic, not knowing that if the cow was exclusively taken care of, and all attention concentrated on increasing her yield of milk, in making her a good breeder, and on making use of every bit of her carcass after she is dead, she would be more than an economic proposition. If someone could convince me that both the cow and the buffalo could be protected, without our having to feed on them or slaughtering them, I should be only too willing to include both in my scheme. The fact, however, is that the buffalo, apart from her milk, is an uneconomic animal. Except in a few wet regions of India the buffalo is useless for agricultural purposes, and so we either starve or kill the male progeny. Some of the best known dairies priding themselves on the wonderful milk-yield of their cows have been found to be doing away with the male calves. We have to make them good milkers and good mothers of fine plough-bullocks. It is no use saying that there is no demand for cow’s milk. If we refused to supply any other milk, and if we ensured a supply of the richest and purest and safest milk, everyone would enlist himself as our regular customer.
 
 But the first thing is to eliminate the buffalo. It is like the exclusive emphasis on khadi. You cannot promote khadi by dividing your attention between khadi and mill-cloth. But we have not given the necessary attention to her feed and her upkeep. Show the best results and I tell you you will not have to complain of lack of patronage. Why is there such a mad run on a certain company’s shares? Because people know that it is going to be a highly paying concern. If you could make people believe that yours also would be a payingconcern, they would rush to offer their patronage to you. Concentrate on one. Take a city like Bombay, take a census of the children, enlist the names of people who will buy only cow’s milk for their children, and make your dairy an exclusive cow’s milk supplier for children. Don’t you know how they popularize an article like tea? They distribute free packets of tea, they run free tea-houses. You can do likewise and popularize cow’s milk. Your ambition should be to cater to the needs of the whole of Bombay. There is a demand for cow’s milk in a city like Calcutta. The best Haryana breed are imported to Calcutta, but as soon as the cows go dry they go to the butcher. The result is that the Haryana cow is getting scarce in the Punjab. No, the cow need not go to the butcher at all. She will have more than paid for her upkeep for her dry years by her rich yield of milk and progeny, and after death, she would fetch the same value as she did when alive. The cow can either be protected by the State or by those who are really religiously inclined. The State we may leave aside for the moment, it is the religiously inclined who should rise to the occasion and bring to bear knowledge and industry to the task. Humanitarianism without knowledge is futile and may even be harmful.

Courtesy: Nehru Memorial Museum and Library        NOT 	A POLITICAL 	ORGANIZATION  	As lovers of Hindi know the next session of the Hindi Sahitya 	Sammelan is to take place in Simla. A correspondent who is working 	in Simla writes to say that there is a suspicion that the Sammelan 	is a political organization with anti-Muslim tendencies. Having been 	twice its President, I can unhesitatingly say that it is a purely 	non-political organization. It has Rajas and Maharajas as its 	patrons. It has numerous non-Congressmen who are identified with it. 	Rajas and Maharajas often attend the sessions. His Highness the 	Maharaja of Baroda has been one of its Presidents. So far as I know 	it has no anti- Muslim tendencies. I could not have presided if I 	had suspected any. I hope by anti-Muslim is not meant anti-Urdu. 	Many use anti-Urdu and anti-Muslim as synonymous terms. But that is 	a superstition. Urdu is the common language of many Hindus and 	Mussalmans in the Punjab, Delhi and Kashmir. It is also significant 	that at the session of the Sammelan held in Indore in 1935 it 	defined Hindi to mean that     
 language which Hindus and Muslims of the North spoke and wrote either in Devanagari or Persian script. I hope, therefore, that even if anti-Muslim has been used in the sense of anti-Urdu, the suspicion to which my correspondent refers will be dispelled and that the work of preparations for the session of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan to be held in Simla will proceed without any suspicion about its  object  or attitude.
 THE SOCIAL BAIT
 A friend who has had occasion to study the work  of the Salvation Army sends me the following interesting note:
 The Salvation Army is essentially a religious body with ‘aggressive evangelism’ as its main characteristic. The social work the Army does ‘has from the first been regarded by the Army leaders as an organized warfare against social evils in order to clear the way for evangelization.’ This is from the Encyclopaedia Britannica (14th edition). It further says that ‘It was realized that the physical and the environmental condition of many of the people, especially in great cities, made it extremely difficult for them to apprehend the spiritual message which the Army had to deliver. Therefore various social activities arose, diverse in character but all actuated by the same purpose’, and General Booth himself in one of his letters to his son has said that ‘the social works is the bait, but it is salvation that is the hook that lands the fish.’
 The object and the work of this Mission according to its Founder is ‘to seek the conversion of the neglected crowds of people who are living without God and without hope, and to gather those so converted into Christian Fellowship.’ It is also stated in the Salvation Army Year Book for 1937 that ‘upon Salvationists everywhere was urged the importance of personal evangelism—that each one was responsible before God for the salvation of others. Personal touch, personal conversation, personal effort, it was pointed out, was of paramount importance nay, was the duty of every wearer of our uniform.’ Thus ‘Every Soldier a Soul-winner’ became and remains an inspiring slogan.
 Of course what is true of the Army is more or less true of all Christian Missions. Their social work is undertaken not for its own sake but as an aid to the salvation of those who receive social service. The history of India would have been written differently if the Christians had come to India to live their lives in our midst and permeate ours with their aroma if there was any. There would then have been mutual goodwill and utter absence of suspicion. But say some of them, “If what you say had held good with Jesus there wouldhave been no Christians.” To answer this would land me in a controversy in which I have no desire to engage. But I may be
 permitted to say that Jesus preached not a new religion but a new life. He called men to repentance. It was he who said, “Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.”libtech_494_footnote
 Harijan, 12-6-1937
 "
398,,HARIJANS,"
  
 But as for Harijans themselves, I certainly do not agree that they are stupid, or unintelligent, or lacking in religious sense. They are not even unsophisticated. If we tried to use the high pressure methods of which you accuse us, I assure you, we would get no results among them. To me they are just nice people very much like myself and my brothers and sisters and friends. To be sure, they are oppressed and illiterate, even unkempt, but they are thoughtful, spiritual-minded, generous, kindly; in character they seem to me above, rather than below, the average of mankind. I like them better than savarnas—but that is my bad taste, perhaps.
 Still, I cannot figure out how you can live among them and hold such a superficial attitude towards them. The only explanation that comes to my mind is that you either do not know them or you are insincere. The latter is unworthy of attention. But the former might be true—for we sometimes know least those who live in the same house with us. Harijans do have strong self- protective complex that is hard to get past. A reserve past which they will not readily let an outsider come. They may be in awe of your ‘Mahatmaship’ (as we all are, a little) or it may be because they think you are a reincarnation of Rama (as they do think). Maybe you begin by trying to ‘uplift’ them—it seems to be against human nature to appreciate being ‘uplifted’. Maybe you still unconsciously have a little ‘high-caste’ attitude–savarna Christians have that trouble sometimes. It may be your city outlook. Whatever it is, you are not seeing them as I see them.
 I admit I have certain advantages. I myself am a villager, so can enter into their life of farming, gardening, raising chickens, pigs, goats, cows. As a nurse I could help them in sickness and teach them how to have better health. I was an ‘untouchable’ to savarna Hindus, as they were, and was glad to be allowed to get water out of a decent cattle trough rather than the tanks the pigs and buffaloes wallowed in, when I toured in the villages. So I wasn’t an outsider to their life—not even a ‘visitor’. I was, as they said, a ‘relative’, one of themselves. It naturally followed that we would love and respect each other
 
 and that we would trust each other spiritually. Our spiritual communion was always on terms of equality. I received as much from them as I gave—maybe more. At least I can testify that some of the deepest spiritual thinking, the most exquisite spiritual attainment, that I have ever known, I have seen in the souls of Depressed-Class Hindus—and I don’t mean exceptional, educated ones, I mean illiterate villagers. But would I have seen it if I had been haggling them to become Christians? I assure you I would not!
 Occasionally for information I asked one who was thorougly familiar with Christian doctrine, what he thought of it, pro and con, and he answered me as readily and frankly as if I had asked whether to feed an ox oil cake or jowari and why.
 To be sure they talk politics and economics, but it is only the spiritual interest that holds them till midnight, brings them back at dawn, and in the hot noonday with the plea, ‘If you knew how we want to hear that God loves us, you wouldn’t want to rest.’
 If you cannot meet that need, you cannot hold  the  Depressed Classes—if you can meet it you will hold them. For that is what they are asking—yes, and Shudras, too, and even some merchants and Brahmins.
This is an extract from a long letterlibtech_495_footnotelibtech_496_footnotereceived from an American
 sister who has lived for years in India as a Missionary. I heartily endorse the last statement in the extract. Of course, if I cannot meet their spiritual needs, I cannot hold the Harijans. But I am not so stupid as to think that I or any single person can supply the spiritual needs of his neighbour. Spiritual needs cannot be supplied through the intellect or through the stomach even as the needs of the body cannot be supplied through the spirit. One can paraphrase the famous saying of Jesus and say “Render unto the body that which is its, and unto the spirit that which is its.’ And the only way I can  supply  my neighbour’s spiritual needs is by living the life of the spirit without even exchanging a word with him. The life of the spirit will translate itself into acts of love for my neighbour. Therefore I have not a shadow of doubt that Hinduism will (and rightly) lose Harijans if the so-called caste Hindus will not love Harijans—the outcaste Hindus—even as themselves. If they will just do that and nothing else, Hinduism is safe and so are Harijans and they. If they will not, they and Hinduism will surely perish. The so-called high-caste Hindus may spend millions for Harijans, but if they do not do the one thing needful, i.e., regard the Harijans as their spiritual equals, the material
 
 aid will stink in their nostrils and will be and deserve to be thrown away as so much waste.
 But to admit that Harijans have the same spiritual need as the rest of us, is not to say that they would understand the intellectual presentation of Christianity as much as I would, for instance. I put them on the same level as my own wife. Her spiritual needs are no less than mine, but she would no more understand the presentation of Christianity than any ordinary Harijan would. The reason is obvious. We came together practically as children. My studies went on in spite of marriage. She never attended a school before marriage. I neglected her educational training. Presentation, with a view to conversion, of a faith other than one’s own, can only necessarily be through an appeal to the intellect or the stomach or both. I do maintain in spite of the extract I have quoted that the vast mass of Harijans, and for that matter Indian humanity, cannot understand the presentation of Christianity, and that generally speaking their conversion wherever it has taken place has not been a spiritual act in any sense of the term. They are conversions for convenience. And I have had overwhelming corroboration of the truth during my frequent and extensive wanderings.
 The writer has no warrant for suggesting that I do not know or love Harijans sufficiently because I attribute to Harijans inability to receive Christian teachings. My attitude is not ‘superficial’ as she will have it to be. Whatever it is, it is based on deep experience and observation dependent not on day’s or even a year’s contact, but on close contact for years with tens of thousands of India’s masses, not as a superior being but feeling as one of them. But she is wholly right when she says, ‘whatever it is, you are not seeing them as I see them.’ They are my kith and kin, breathing the same air, living the same life, having the same faith, the same aspirations, and the same earth sustaining us in life as it will in death! And for her?

399,,HARIJAN QUARTERS IN JAMSHEDPUR,"
  
 I commend the foregoing reasoned and reasonable statementlibtech_497_footnoteto the attention of the Tatas. A chain is no stronger than its weakest link. In spite of all its sanitary condition, if the Harijan quarters
 
 
 remain neglected, as they appear to be, Jamshedpur runs the risk of having nasty eruptions of diseases born of insanitation. Proper sanitation is impossible in hovels. To provide decent quarters of the most useful servants of society is the soundest investment in which there is always gain and never any loss. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the reform suggested by Vindhyeshwari Babu will be taken in hand without delay.

 June 12, 1937
 You must know that this work is for your own benefit, and not for the benefit of the malguzar. He had never even thought of this. But you will not keep your promise and I have come to express my pain to you. You must remember that this is a recurring task. Every year the road will have to be renewed and stone will have to be supplied by you. If you do not co-operate with me, all the labour that we have put in this year will be wasted. This year the profits from the village have not been equal to the tasks we have undertaken, and it was never my purpose to draw upon Jamnalalji’s other income for the purposes of this village. I shall therefore have to find the expense from the donations I receive for Segaon work. You will therefore understand the gravity of the breach of promise. I therefore appeal to those of you who have not kept their promises to cart the stones to the other road. I shall ask Jamnalalji to pay for the stones and use the proceeds for the welfare of Segaon.
 But I am told that you are indifferent to all that is happening, that you do not care whether you have the road here or not. I ask you to put your heads together and decide whether you should co-operate with us or not. I do not refer to untouchability. There is no untouchability involved in this work, nor in the revival of your handicrafts. If you co-operate, I can assure you that your income will easily be doubled. Then there is the question of sanitation. I cannot make your village neat and clean and sweet-smelling without your co- operation. We have engaged a scavenger here. We pay for his service, but it is for you to keep your streets and lanes clean. We have
 
 quantities of human manure stored up here, but I am told that you would not give your carts on hire to cart this manure. Nowhere do we come across such apathy on the part of the people. Peasants everywhere in India and the world handle manure and turn it to good account.libtech_501_footnote

 June 15, 1937
 BHAI NATHUBHAI,
 The period of  vanapravesh will last up to 58.libtech_514_footnoteIn these many years you can do a lot. When a man enters the forest he is bound to make friends with trees, leaves, birds and animals. He would attain fearlessness, be acquainted with Nature, would live in the midst of men and animals and know what man's place in the world is and, by the time he emerges from the forest, would have gathered such knowledge which would be helpful to himself and which would enable him to guide his neighbours. We have to create such a forest in our heart. If physical desires lose their keenness and we become inward-looking, we shall have gained much.
 You have done a bit of research to discover my mistake. I have also had letters from four or five other Gujarati friends from the  South in that regard. Indu stayed for quite some time with me and we talked at length on many things. He is still a child. He is not yet aware of his responsibilities. But he does have some good qualities. He has great regard for Kanti. He wishes to share in lightening the burden that has fallen on you. Hence I hope that he will do something. Now he will be staying under the direct care  of  Kanti.  Everything, therefore, will be well."

       From 	a photosate of the Gujarati: G.N. 6250       Blessings 	from  BAPU          SEGAON, 
     BHAI 	JETHALAL,  June 	16, 1937 
  	I have your letter. Now observe the 30th July but instead of the 	30th you can observe the 31st because July has thirty-one days. Do 	send the book of Vinoba. I suppose the Mobile Weaving School of 	Travancore must be mentioned only in the pages of his book; I 	somehow could find no trace of it there. There is no explanation for    
 my going to Gujarat. Of course, I was expected to go there for two or three days to inspect the site for the Congress. But then I also have no reason for not going either. I may say that Sardar's keen insistence dragged me. But this is not real defence. If sardar's insistence can persuade me to do something wrong, his other importunities may persuade me to commit greater wrongs. In spite of knowing all this I could not withstand his insistence.
 Now about cow's ghee. I charge Rs. 3 per seer or even two and a half. I charge according to the cost. I am able to get this much  because there are people like Jamnalalji and I am able to insist on their using cow's ghee prepared in Wardha. But I shall not be able to carry on this Rs. 3 per seer business for long. Your ghee of course cannot be sold even free of cost because we cannot accept an agency for buffalo's ghee. Moreover your ghee is adulterated. It is my firm belief that this business of yours is wrong. As you do not abide by the regulations of the Goseva Sangh, you do not get any help from them and therefore make adulterated ghee at home. Naturally it fetches lower price in the market. Nowadays ghee made out of pure buffalo's milk fetches a good price in the market. Ghee made from from pure cow's milk fetches a lower price. So if at the moment you make no distinction between the cow and the buffalo, you should engage yourself in making ghee only out of buffalo's milk. You will surely succeed in it. I can understand that it will not give you mental satisfaction. But if you derive any mental satisfaction from mixing cow's milk with buffalo's, it is a false satisfaction. Hence it is my sincere advice that you should either make ghee out of pure cow's milk and sell it at the normal rate or, failing that, find some other occupation which would be beneficial to the villages. Obtain from the public whatever cannot be met by the income from the business.
 But this after all is my opinion. There is no absolute rule that you have to follow my advice in such matters. Of course I would never insist. So think over my argument and do only what you think proper. Kishorelalbhai will of course read this, and, if possible, Vinoba, too. I shall try to send their opinions along with this.

            DEAR 	FRIEND,        MAGANWADI, WARDHA,  June 	17, 1937 
  	I welcome your letter. I must admit that the decision, after meeting 	in Delhi and thereafter, I had forgotten. But the recollection does 	not affect what I saidlibtech_516_footnotelibtech_517_footnoteat Hudli. My charge was against those who had come to 	induce me to preside at the meeting in Belgaum. I was most 	disinclined knowing well that my programme would not be popular nor 	my method of work. But Gangadharrao whom I knew very well bore down 	my opposition and assured me that Mr. Chikodi and others would 	whole-heartedly work out the  scheme.  Gangadharrao himself admits 	that he failed. He could not even personally confine himself to 	cow's milk, nor Mr. Chikodi who was to be active worker in the 	movement. As I said the collapse of the     
 resolution of the big body was tragic, through no fault of anybody. But my fault was in not sufficiently realizing that my method of working out the cow-protection programme would not be popular and that I would have to show results by experimenting. That experiment is still going on. Tanning at Ahmedabad did not succeed, because the so-called experts were not really experts. But as it always existed in my imagination it has taken shape in Wardha and Bengal. In Wardha the experiment is being conducted under my direct supervision and in Bengal under the supervision of one of my colleagues. I can still show no striking results because the experiment is novel and difficult. This programme is not any part of the village movement, although it can be. It is being worked out independently as part of the scheme not of village improvement but of cow-protection. My point remains that those who invited me in Belgaum to take up the cow-protection work were previously in that field and should not have given it up because I failed or seemed to fail.

KRISHNACHANDRA,  	It is surprising that you do not notice the unity of thought between 	my current writings and what I wrote in  Anasaktiyogalibtech_523_footnote. We creatures are not all dharmaja progeny, 	but kamaja. Let us suppose that a man in full control of his 	passion desires progeny and a suitable mate, too, who desires 	progeny only from him and is not moved by passion. Their son would 	be dharmaja. But this does not imply that none among their 	ancestors were  kamaja.libtech_524_footnoteThus what I mean is that       
 though we are full of imperfections we should make an effort at any rate to rid ourselves of them.
 I cannot say from personal experience whether it is possible or not to procreate dharmaja offspring but I do hold that the remark in the Adiparva of Mahabharta regarding Vyasji stems from experience.libtech_525_footnotelibtech_526_footnoteIt is possible that it is only a poetic fancy   and not an actual experience. But this takes away nothing from my argument because if a couple come together not moved by passion but only for the sake of progeny, their brahmacharya is in no was lessened. But there can be only one single offspring of this kind. This is a description of the ideal state. And we must try to reach it to the extent we can.
 Procreation is no obligatory duty, but the desire for it is no sin either. Thus marriage is impermissible for one who has no wish for progeny, i.e., satisfaction of passion should never be the ground for marriage. Married people should follow their duty keeping this ideal in view.
 Write to me when all your efforts for securing a job have failed. Please bear in mind that I have no idea what resources I may have then. And in case you have to come here you should settle down contentedly because you should not limit your services on the basis of the amount of salary you may get.

 "
428,,HOW THEY CONVERT,"
  
 Thakkar Bapa had his attention drawn to the so-called  conversion to Christianity in Shahabad District. He thereupon called for a report on the statements made to him. The following is the reportlibtech_527_footnotelibtech_528_footnotemade by the local Harijan Sevak Sangh:
 In the district of Shahbad, about 40 years ago, a Methodist Episcopal Christian Mission was established at Arrah. Through its efforts a large number of Harijans, numbering about three thousand, were converted to Christianity up to the year 1931.       Last year a Roman Catholic Mission
 appeared on the scene. Since then, the activities of both the Missions have increased	Enquiry has revealed that they have been successful in getting
 
 some new Christian converts from the Rabidas (Chamar) community amongst whom their activities are mainly confined. Roughly their method of work may be described as follows:
 After having visited the village and created familiarity with the Harijans they at once start a school and put it in charge of a Harijan teacher who either himself is an influential man or related to such a one. Whenever they come to learn that some tension or actual litigation is going on between the Harijans and other villagers they at once seize the opportunity to take up the side of the poor Harijans and help them with money and advice. They are thus hailed as saviours and conversion follows as if to repay the obligation.
 As their work is scattered throughhout the thana in the  remotest villages, the present enquiry could not be exhaustive . . . . The one remarkable feature of these recent conversions is that they take place en masse. Whenever a village Harijan leader accepts the new faith almost all
 belonging to his clan follow him         In all cases of conversions new or
 old, not a single instance can be found in which the acceptance of the new faith was due to  any religious conviction       The reasons, therefore,  of
 conversions may be roughly described as economic or socioeconomic. Generally, the Harijans have to submit to a number of unjust exactions and  to suffer from humiliating treatment which are now resented by them  .  .  .
 Those of the new and the old who are still continuing as nominal Christians are willing to return to Hinduism if their grievances are removed. Their grievances as disclosed during the enquiry are briefly indicated below:
  They 	are forced to 	labour for 	their maliks 	and other 	caste Hindus of their 	villages at 	about half or 	even less wages then they 	would get for the same 	kind of labour 	in other villages.  They 	are forced 	to labour 	for their 	maliks and 	other caste-Hindu 	villgers on 	occasions of 	marriages and 	deaths in 	their families on 	almost no 	wages.  They 	are charged six 	annas per year per family 	as mutharfa 	(house rent).  They 	have to pay Re. 1, Rs. 2 	and Rs. 3 or Rs. 4 for the hide 	of every 	dead cow, bullock 	or buffalo 	respectively to 	their owners if 	they fail to 	deliver a 	corresponding number of 	pairs of 	shoes to them.  Their 	wives are paid 	only four annas for a 	male or 	two annas 	for a 	female child born in 	the house 	of the 	caste-Hindu villagers 	where they have to 	work as 	midwives during 	confinement, and even 	these payments are 	not regularly made.  They 	are forced to work for their maliks 	and caste-Hindu 	villgers even at 	the sacrifice 	of their 	own agricultural 	needs or 	when they are 	ill or 	engaged in 	their social or 	religious functions. 
 
  The levy of the Chowkidari tax on them is generally excessive. They 	are not allowed to draw water from wells used by caste Hindus.  They 	are not 	allowed to enter temples 	nor are Brahmin 	priests available 	to recite 	religious kathas at 	their houses. 
 If what is said in the report about the conversions be true, it is from my standpoint reprehensible. Such superficial conversions can only give rise to suspicion and strife. But if a missionary body or individuals choose to follow the methods described in the report, nothing can be done to prevent them. It is therefore much more profitable to turn the searchlight inward and to discover our own defects. Fortunately the report enables us to do so. Nine causes are enumerated to show why Harijans are induced to leave the Hindu fold. Seven are purely economic, one is social, and one is purely religious. Thus they are reduced economically, degraded socially and boycotted from religious participation. The wonder is not that they leave Hinduism; the wonder is that they have not done so for so long and that so few leave their ancestral faith even when they do. The moral is obvious. Let us make every discovery, such as the one made in Shahabad, an occasion for greater self-purification, greater dedication to the harijan cause, greater identification with the Harijans. It should result in the local Sangh collecting more workers than it has for doing on the one hand service among the Harijans and on the other propaganda among the so-called caste Hindus, not in the shape of reviling them but showing them that religion does not warrant the treatment that is meted out to Harijans by them.

429,,429. KHADI AT HARIPURA,"
 Sjt. Dastane is anxious that something striking should happen at Haripura so as to make khadi much more popular than it is. There are other workers who no doubt anticipate great things from Haripura about khadi. Bardoli's promise to be wholly self-sustained about khadi made in 1921 still remains unredeemed. Painful to tell, Bardoli like other places falls back on Wardha for its cheap and well-coloured khadi. The khadi method excludes concentration. Wardha is in no need of outside patronage. And if it began to rely on it, it would harm itself and khadi in the long run. The secret of success in khadi is for each taluk or at least district to produce and use its own khadi.
 But Sjt. Dastane says, though the Working Committee has re- emphasized the fourfold programme of 1920, there is hardly an
 M.L.A. who talks about it to his constituency. And if the khadi-lovers, too, do not show application or orginality, khadi has a poor chance of becoming universal. There is force in what Sjt. Dastane says. But things are not quite as bad as he perhaps imagines.  In  Nalwadi, Vinoba is practically concentntrating the whole of his attention on khadi. He is making experiments to see whether the minimum of three annas per day of eight hours for spinners is an easily realizable proposition. It bids fair to succeed. There is a boy 16 year old who is  a villager of quite the ordinary type. He is earning four annas per day. If the average villager has a sufficient ocular demonstration of the possibility of earning three annas per day, and if he or she knows that there is an organization that will take in all the standard yarn that can be produced, there will be a spontaneous response. Now this kind of very solid work does not admit of haste or a spectacular display. Then there is one great difficulty in the way. The spinners, weavers and other artisans engaged in khadi production are expected to use khadi for their own wear. This means popular education in the economics of khadi, a change in the mentality of the poor artisans who do not know anything of why they are so helpless and poor and still less of how they can help themselves to get rid of their ignorance and poverty. The spread of such education means again a large number of workers possessing love of khadi and an adequate  knowledge  of  the economics and the technique of khadi.
 Thus there are very natural difficulties to be overcome in the attempt to make khadi universal. Let Sjt. Dastane and others who feel like him about khadi make a deep study of the science and make their own experiments if they have any original contribution to make or pursue the beaten track and give to the work their exclusive attention.

 "
430,,430. MAN’S INHUMANITY,"
 Not many people know what is phooka. Still fewer know that there is an association in Calcutta called the Anti-phooka Association. Its patrons are Maharajadhiraja Sir Bijoy Chand Mahatab Bahadur and Justice Sir L. W. J. Costello. Its president is Shri Ramkumar
 
 Bangar. The office is at 65 Pathuriaghata Street. The Secretary thus describes the process of phooka:
 I have to inform you that the atrocities of phooka are perpetrated on each milch animal twice daily. The four legs of the animal are tied to four strong posts and two men hold the animal so tightly that she cannot make any movement of her limbs whatsoever. A bamboo rod or pipe, 22 inches long and 8 inches in circumference, is then forcibly pushed into the generative organ of the animal, and then one man begins to blow air into the uterus, causing it to be fully distended thereby. This inflammation causes extra pressure on the glands which helps the milkman to extract the last drop of milk. The milking also is indescribably cruel, and  it  is continued to the great pain of the animal till blood comes out of the udder. Sometimes a few drops of the blood get mixed up with the milk. Unable to make any movements, the animal silently bears this inhuman torture and her great pain is manifested only by the copious perspiration and tears that flow down her body and cheeks. This is repeated twice daily and the animal invaribly swoons after each operation.
It is difficult to conceive anything more torturing or revolting
 than the process described by the Secretary. From the proceedings of a meeting of the Association it appears that the practice results in the sterility of the cows and she-buffaloes subjected to the torture. They are therefore transferred to butchers after they cease to yield milk even in spite of phooka.
 The Association undertakes the prosecution of the torturers. It engages plain-clothes detectives to discover the culprits. The activity of the Association is good as far as it goes. But it does not appear to me to go far enough. Punishment of a few criminals won't stop the inhumanity. It is necessary to carry on propaganda among the offenders and educate them to understand the evils of the system. Of course the surest way of dealing with the evil is for the Corporation to take charge of the whole of the milk supply of Calcutta and change the gwalas into its paid servants. They would then not be open to temptation as they are now. They will be under sanitary supervision. Milking will be done under proper control. The citizens will have a guarantee of having pure milk for their money. And there is not the slightest reason why the milk supply department should not be self- supporting. The citizens will gladly pay an extra pie, if an increase in the selling price becomes necessary. Of course the milk supply has to
 become a monopoly of a municipality undertaking the enterprise, even as the postal stamp is a monopoly of the State.

 I got Manilal's letter. Kallenbach will leave this place on July 7. I hope that he will come back in December. Here he lives just like one of us. He wears only a dhoti, but sometimes a shirt also. He has purchased a lot of khadi and got some dresses made. This time he is not at all inclined to go anywhere for sight-seeing. Next time when he comes I will send him to visit the Taj, etc.
 In Segaon, where there was only one hut, several houses have come up now. There seems to be no end to the construction work. The number of residents also is increasing.
 Ba, with Kano, is at Maroli with Mithubehn. She is expected to return in a few days now.
 Lakshmi has given birth to a son in Madras. Both of them are well. This time she didn't suffer much. Kanti has gone to Bangalore to study in a college. Kishorelal is keeping indifferent health.

  	I have read your essay on democracy and your speech on conversion. 	Both are good but you must work out your individualistic 
 cultural democracy. The charge against Hinduism is that it is too individualistic. I have thought it to be a baseless charge. But you seem to have some other idea. My own opinion is that Hinduism has made the greatest research in that line but simply failed to carry out its discoveries in practice and therefore seemed to be individualistic, i.e., selfish.

       June 	22, 1937  DEAR 	MR. MHATRE,  	I   am   glad   of   your   reportlibtech_541_footnotewhich   will  be   very   helpful   in regulating 	traffic and in repairing, if it is possible, the bad roads. I am 	passing on your report to the Sardar.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a copy: C.W. 9827. Courtesy: Baburao D. Mhatre       June 	22, 1937  The 	Associated Press special correspondent greeted Mahatma Gandhi early 	this morning today at 	his hut in Segaon village 	with a copy 	of Viceroy's 	message to India. 	Mahatma Gandhi 	who was having 	discussions with 	Seth Jamnalal Bajaj 	and other 	workers asked the 	correspondent to 	wait for a 	few minutes. 	In 15 minutes 	Mahatma Gandhi 	called in the 	correspondent, handed 	back the Viceroy's 	statement which was sent 	to him earlier 	by the correspondent 	and asked 	him to read 	it aloud 	for the benefit of himself 	and others 	present. Gandhiji attentively listened while the 	correspondent read 	the entire 	message slowly. At the 	conclusion of 	reading. Mahatma Gandhi 	asked the correspondent: Now, 	what do you want?  On 	being told 	that his reactions 	on the 	statement were 	wanted, Mahatma Gandhi shrugged his shoulders and beckoned to the correspondent to take down.    
 I have listened to the Viceroy's statement most attentively, but I am sorry that I cannot make any statement. The Working Committee will finally decide on July 5 on the grave issue that is before the country and I hope that no Congressman will want to anticipate the decision of the Working Committee and offer criticism.
 The conversation then turned to the Segaon village and village folk. Mahatma Gandhi said that the village had considerably improved and that there were better cows in the village than elsewhere in Wardha. People were healthy and they had plenty of fresh air even more than he because they were bold people, not sophisticated.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. It is unfortunate but it is true that I have not been able to appreciate the utility of your method as a contribution to the communal tangle. That does not mean that there is no value in cultural contact. I think it has great value. But I am  more  than doubtful as to the possibility of organizing such contact. I do not know if I have expressed myself clearly. Rabindranath has, of all the men of the world, perhaps, made the largest contribution in that direction. But it has not been through any organization. His writings have compelled attention. I should be delighted if your writings serve the same purpose. But then you do not need my  certificate  or  anybody else's, even as the Poet does not. I wonder if I have made my position clear. I, somehow or other, feel that yours is a different position. Maybe that I have not understood it and, therefore, I have been indifferent to it. I would be satisfied if I can make you believe that my indifference is not due to cussedness or even to want of study of your thought expressed by you. The moment I begin to appreciate your method you will find me advertising it in my own humble way. But you seem to be paralysed without my advertisement and this hurts me. Why should you need my advertisement? Surely the names you have gathered round yourself are far better judges of your work than  I ever can be.
It is easy enough now to answer your questions.
 The solid work for villages that I have in mind is the work such as the Spinners' Association is doing among thousand of artisans irrespective of their caste or creed. I hope to publish statistics showing
 the number of artisans with whom the Spinners' Association has established contact–not political but purely economic. Of course, anyone who has faith in such kind of contact can work for it if he has the desire to learn the technique.
 This work is necessarily confined to the villages because the bulk of these artisans are to be found in the villages and these are the people who are in need of the assistance of the kind we are offering.
 The third and the fourth question are answered in the foregoing paragraphs.
 The fifth question is answered in the preliminary paragraph.  You do not seem to have kept  a  copy  of  your  letter.  I  am,
therefore, returning your letter in order to enable you to see if I have
 covered all your questions. If I have not, you should tell me and I shall make another endeavour to answer your questions.
 Yours sincerely,

 BHAI BHAGWANJI,
 It was good that you visited Vadavashram near Khambhat. I can never feel hurt by anything you write. How can there be any objection to your letting me know whatever you think? As long as you are alive, how is it possible that the good name and reputation of Karsanji Mulchand would be lost? How can I explain that I had spared no effort in writing to Bhai Narbheram about you? I may not have told you that I had also entered into correspondence with Prof. Thakore regarding the matter. If I didn't do so, the reason must have been that there was nothing important in it. But I had tried my level best. I was not in a position to arbitrate in the dispute between you two. I had neither the necessary material nor the time.
 You have now sent a letter for Devchandbhai. I do not know what I shall be able to do in that regard. I am sending that letter to Devchandbhai. I shall let you know if I get a reply from him. And if I can do anything in the matter, I certainly will.

450,"June 24, 1937",LETTER TO LORD LOTHIAN,"
  
 SEGAON, WARDHA,
 June 24, 1937
 DEAR LORD LOTHIAN,
 My deepest thanks for your long letterlibtech_542_footnote. I appreciate the patient effort you are making to convince me of the correctness of your advice. With much of what you say I wholly agree. The question of office-acceptance will now be finally decided at the forthcoming meeting of the Working Committee of the Congress. The Viceroy has just saidlibtech_543_footnotethe last word about the Government's attitude. I admit that it is an improvement upon the first speechlibtech_544_footnoteon the situation by Lord Zetland.
 Whatever the decision of the Working Committee may be–and you will have known it before this reaches you–what I would like to write upon is the fundamental difference between the colonies and India. So far as I know, the colonists were armed and knew the use of arms. The vast majority of thirty millions of voters here are unarmed, do not know the use of arms and perhaps would not like to be armed even if they were left absolutely free to do so–such is Indian culture. Though, therefore, I have pinned my faith to working along constitutional lines, I have, as every Indian has, either to think out a programme whereby every adult can be trained in the use of arms or find a substitute. At my instance, the Congress has for the last eighteen years attempted to experiment with the substitute called non-violent non-co-operation, civil resistance, etc. For myself I have rejected the idea of achieving freedom by the use of arms in the last resort and I have accepted as its final substitute the use of non-violence in every shape and form. The use of arms is not an unexplored field, that of non-violence has possibilities of infinite exploration. Hence my eagerness to discover a formula whereby, consistently with the Congress creed of complete independence, office-acceptance may be possible. But I must confess that I have not the faith that you have in the possibility of the existing Act to expand into an instrument of complete freedom. On the contrary, I believe in common with the vast majority of educated Indians that it is incapable of giving India what it wants and the sooner it is replaced by something of Indian design the better.
 
 Of course, the Act does contemplate militarization of India at a snail's pace and therefore it is not so repugnant to those overwhelming numbers of Indians who want India to develop military power as it is to me who would if I could take India along a wholly different route.
 Now, if you think that my reasoning is erroneous and that it is possible for India to attain her full height without the back-ground of either military training or of non-violent training, you should come to India during next autumn if only to teach me. In any case, if the Congress decides upon office-acceptance it will be the beginning of real difficulty in one way and your coming is likely to be helpful. If the Congress decides otherwise, you will perhaps yourself  feel impelled to come here in order that you might not leave a single stone unturned to avert a calamity which it would be if the rule of the sword replaces the rule of the electorate, that is, democracy, however, incipient it might be.
 Yours sincerely,

451,"June 	24, 1937",LETTER TO KANTILAL GANDHI,"
          CHI. 	KANTI,     June 	24, 1937 
  	I got your letter. I read also your letter to Mahadev. The latter I 	consider an excellent letter. You have been able to describe very 	vividly the struggle going on in your heart. Your decision is of 	course good. If you have determination, and indeed you have it, any 	college will be good for you. But compared to Bombay, Bangalore is 	superior because there you will have more freedom. The fact that the 	Principal has sent his son to Bombay counts little with me, for in 	doing so he has merely put a higher value on Bombay degrees. For you 	such value has, and I think should have, secondary importance.  	It is not the university that brings credit to a brilliant student 	but the latter that brings credit to a university. There is a small 	village in England named Louth. Tennyson was a pupil in that school 	and because of that even today the teachers of that school take 	great pride in it. In the same way you should bring glory to the 	college in Bangalore. What pains me particularly when I see people 	going to England or the West is that those who seek prestige for 	themselves by going to the West gain none, but, of course, they 	certainly raise the value of Western degrees. One can understand 	that those who seek prestige do not gain any, for many who hold 	Western degrees remain 
 unemployed. But anyone who has ability, whether he holds a degree from the East or from the West, does acquire prestige. The late Dr. Tribhovandas was only an L.M.&S. He used to charge Rs. 1,000 a day as fee. He was unrivalled both as physician and surgeon. And in the art of restoring a nose that had been cut off, he has had no equal anywhere in the world. The chief reason was that at that time dacoits had made it a custom to cut the noses of high officials. Had Tribhovandas been diffident he would have called in some English doctor in such cases. But being courageous he held the knife and the needle in his own hands and restored the noses in all or almost all cases. If a man is honest, he is sure to become proficient through experience. I have written all this to strengthen you in your decision, for people will continue to put before you all sorts of arguments that might persuade you to revise your decision. Your aim is to acquire knowledge. It is not as if after getting a degree one need gain no further knowledge. It is possible that real knowledge is acquired only after getting a degree because that has been the experience of most people. Regarding your lodging and boarding make whatever arrangement you think will suit you from the point of view of health and studies.
 I did get Saraswati's letter and had also replied to her. It is likely that the reply might have been delayed.
 There is one sentence in your letter, ""Some of the manners of the people over here seem very uncivilized."" Who are those people?
 Ba, Kanu and Kusum Desai are expected here the day after tomorrow.
 It is cool now. The first rains of the season have not been satisfactory.
 Most probably Amtul Salaam will have a tonsillitis operation the day after tomorrow.

  	I got your letter. I will wait for you after the time limit you have 	fixed.  	A sister from Madras had come here the day before yesterday and left 	the same day. Pyarelal says that you know her. Her name is 	Soundaram. She had also brought her vina, which was worth Rs. 150. 	The chief reason of its high value was its decoration. Without the 	decoration it would be worth only Rs. 80. But what I like most was 	her mastery in playing on the vina. She sang, too, to the 	accompaniment of the vina. Her voice is sweet. During all that time 	I remembered you. She said she would come again some other time.  	You have not followed my questions about book-keeping. That only 	means that you have not understood the technical terms of book- 	keeping. So to that extent you probably do not know book-keeping. 	Show that letter to Narandas. If he does not understand my terms, 	then  I will have to admit that I do not know the technical language 	of book-keeping and, therefore, could not use it correctly. Narandas 	knows book-keeping throughly well. I learnt just enough of it for my 	legal practice, with my own effort, and it is possible, therefore, 	that I do not know the technical terms as well as an expert in 	book-keeping. In short, what I had asked from you was a summary, or 	'abstract' as it is called in English, of the different accounts in 	the ledger. If neither the register nor the abstracts are available 	here, we cannot know what the credit or debit balances are in the 	different accounts. And such occasions are bound to arise when it 	becomes necessary to know the figures. Do complete the accounts. 	While you are there, try to perfect your knowledge of book-keeping.  	Similarly you may increase your knowledge of music as much as you 	wish to. You are doing well in planning to go to Chorwad a little 	earlier.  	Amtul Salaam's amount has been received. I see that you go to bed at 	11. I consider it too late. Everybody should form the habit of going 	to bed by 10. But you should of course follow the convenience of 	others there. 
 I was very glad to learn that Purushottam was keeping good health.
 Ba will most probably come the day after tomorrow. At present the house here is full. Jamnalal's bungalow having been completed, everybody is accommodated comfortably.

 SEGAON, WARDHA,
 June 25, 1937
 CHI. SUMANGAL,
 Your condition is pathetic. I have no grouse  against  your literary pursuits but they should be secondary to physical labour. Tolstoy says that his mind became pure only after he started doing eight hours of physical work every day and only then did his writing become pure. Your case is the reverse of this. You appear to have no interest at all in doing physical labour. That is why I have been dissuading you from joining me. You do not need to fast. You must be at a place where there is some activity or other going on. Only when you have worked hard and have tired yourself out physically should you pursue literary activity if at all.
 Please consider this and write to me. If in the end we decide to have you here, the work here will be regarding the charkha, No salary.

464,,UNFORTUNATE BUT INDISPENSABLE,"
  
 The Secretary of the local Harijan Sevak Sangh of Jamshedpur applied to a lady among others for a subscription and he received the following reply:
 It is some time since your letter of 5th February appealing for funds was received by me.
 I appreciate the good work your Association is doing at Jamshedpur, but, on principle, I cannot bring myself to send any subscription to any Association that calls itself 'Harijan' just because of the interpretation put upon that word in this country.
 I am convinced that as long as any member of a society is classified by a name that savours of inferiority, that section of society will never be raised. I would abolish from our vocabulary the words 'Harijan', 'Depressed Class', and all such other appellations of the same meaning, which are used to distinguish people who should never be separately described from their fellow beings.
The objection raised by the lady is not new. The adoption of the
name 'Harijan' was not a matter of choice, it was one of compulsion.
 So long as the suppressed classes exist, it will be necessary to have some designation for them. Thus Indians in South Africa were popularly distinguished from the rest as 'coolies' or 'sammies'. This
 was resented by them. Protests were made with more or less effect not against a distinguished name but against a name which in itself carried reproach and signified inferiority. So ultimately they came to be classified as Indians as they should have been from the beginning. Even thus were untouchables called by various names denoting reproach and inferiority. The Government officers have  devised  names such as 'depressed', 'backward'. Now they are known as 'scheduled classes'. For the reformers, the name 'Harijan'  was suggested by someone who belonged to the suppressed classes. And that name has been adopted by the Harijan Sevak Sangh, being in its meaning absolutely free from reproach and even fitting in the sense that the despised of man are the dear ones of God, which is what 'Harijan means. What, therefore, is possible and is being done is to remove the last trace of inferiority, but it is not possible to do away with a special name for those whose inferiority is abolished even from the hearts of caste Hindus, so long as the necessity for knowing the liberated ones from the rest exists. I hope, therefore, that the objecting lady will recognize the inevitability of a separate designation for the suppressed class, but appreciate the fact that the word chosen by the Sangh has absolutely no reproach about it, and therefore give her subscription and become an active helper in a cause than which none can be found worthier.

 "
465,,ARE THERE DIFFERENT OATHS?,"
  
 On reading my articlelibtech_558_footnoteon 'Religious Oath and Non-religious', a Quaker friend wrote to a common friend who has passed on the letter to me. I copy the letterlibtech_559_footnotebelow:
 It appears to me that Mr. Gandhi is dealing with two quite distinct questions in this article. I wholly agree with his answer to one of them as, with due respect, I wholly disagree with the other I agree wholly with him
 that a Congressman need not worry over the propriety of the oath.
  But 	the Mahatma's subtle 	mind is too 	much for 	me when 	he draws 	distinctions between religious and non-religious oaths. At any rate we simple 
 
 Quakers look at it thus: Religion is man's search for God, and his reference of all life to the life of God. An affirmation, or promise, to tell the truth and do the truth, is a reference of the self back to the life of God, for Truth is a part of God’s essential nature. Therefore all such promises are religious acts. The Quakers object to oaths, because they claim to be religious people, that is, people who fear God, and intend to observe the truth without swearing in the name of God. As you know, after a long struggle and much suffering they obtained the right to affirm instead of swearing. But affirmation or oath, both are for us religious acts; unless by religion one means something apart from the most part of life. I should not agree that a Court of Law or a Parliament was something apart from religion for a religious man. We, Quakers, are clear
 that all life is religious for the religious man, and have no particular use for a segregated 'religion' . . . .
 Cuttings from two Indian newspapers criticizing the article have also been sent to me.
 What I find after reading the letter and the cuttings is that it is very difficult for me to make myself fully intelligible especially when  I write on anything out of the way. The only thing for me is to endeavour to elucidate my point so long as there is anything to elucidate.
 I can see no subtlety about my argument. But I see the clearest possible distinction between the oath or affirmation that a person takes before a court of law, a legislature and before his God perhaps daily at the time of rising and retiring. They have different functions, different incidences.
 The Quaker friend in my opinion surrenders the whole position when he agrees with me in my interpretation of the legislative or constitutional oath. His quarrel is purely over my designation of oaths. If my designation is faulty, I would accept any other which succinctly shows the distinction I have pointed out and which the friend accepts by implication.
 The mere linguistic meaning of the legislative oath is wholly different from the meaning that the law and tradition have given to it. One not knowing the law and the tradition will certainly have the objection that Shri Shivprasad Gupta has raised. Mere grammatical or linguistic meaning of a sentence divorced from its context and history has often been found erroneous and sometimes positively mischiev- ous. Therefore, knowing the context of the legislative oath, I had no hesitation in saying that there was not the slightest strain on  or violation of truth when I suggested that a Congressman could, consis-
 tently with his creed of complete independence and his resolution of wrecking the Constitution Act, take the oath required by law shortly described by me as legislative.
 And here again my statement must be interpreted in its context and historical perspective. A Congressman entering the Legislature will strive for gaining complete independence working within the law, and so will he try to wreck the Act working within the law. If he can work for its amendment, he can quite properly work for its repeal, i.e., wrecking. Indeed his deadlocks also will be within the law. And he won't be frightened or hang his head low if his opponent twits him by saying that he is after all working the Constitution. He will not, must not, care so long as he knows his mind, hides  nothing  and  is downright honest in all his dealings.
 Of course I agree with the Quaker friend that for a religiously or spiritually minded man religion or rather religious attitude pervades all his thoughts, words and acts.
 But having said this I must adhere to my statement that for the multitudinous purposes of life we find it necessary to distinguish our activities as social, political, mercantile, religious, etc. These divisions can be extended almost to infinity. But the seeker of God will apply his godly attitude even to his sports if he finds time for them.

 I forgot to write to you about one thing. You referred to  Devdas's third child. I agree with you that he should stop now. I must not write, you can, perhaps, must. I have no doubt he knows. I do not know who is greater sinner. They passionately love each other. And then love expresses itself in the painful fashion. I suppose they cannot help themselves. I know what an effort it is to exercise self-restraint when physical love is let loose. Duty separated us for long intervals. That gave me time for thinking and disciplining myself. After the appearance of Devdas I had fairly conquered the animal  in  me. Intense public activity of an exacting nature cast upon me a burden which I could not carry at the some time as making additions to the family. Thus did nature help me. And my greatest good luck was that in Ba I had a companion who never tempted me, so far as I can recall. Such is not the case with the present generation. I do not know that it was better in my generation. Ba is perhaps an exceptional woman. So you see I have boundless charity for Devdas. And yet how I wish the terrible burden on Lakshmi could be removed. Devdas and Lakshmi
 almost make out a case for the use of contraceptives. And yet I know that it will be a fatal conclusion to draw from this hard case. If they cannot restrain themselves Lakshmi must suffer. Now you have all the data, if you have self-confidence enough, to write to Devdas.

         June 	26, 1937  CHI. 	CHHAGANLAL,  	I got your letter. I have written to Ramjibhai. If what you say is 	correct, it is painful. But if the sentiments you have expressed in 	your letter to him are mere politeness, they do not become a 	satyagrahi. A satyagrahi’s language is bound to be extremely 	courteous, but that courtesy is also full of truth. You say: “Seeing 	your step, new khadi workers like me in Kathiawar lose heart. If you 	still think over the matter and change your opinion, please do so 	and reassure workers like me.” You cannot be called a new khadi 	worker at all. And a khadi worker like you would not lose courage 	because of a co- worker’s fall but would become more firm, would 	dedicate himself more whole-heartedly and cultivate greater 	efficiency. But if you have really lost courage because of 	Ramjibhai’s giving up of khadi work,    
 what you say is the bare truth. In that case, however, both you and I will have to think where you stand. For there are bound to be a good many hurdles in our khadi and other activities and, if our faith does not spring from within but is dependent on others, all our activities will fail. There must be a few whose faith would be more immovable even than the Himalayas and would remain steadfast till death. What a lecture I have given you on the beautiful letter you  wrote  to Ramjibhai!

 "
472,,A GREAT EXPERIMENTlibtech_561_footnote,"
    
 The Ahmedabad Labour Union has of late started a great experiment which is likely to prove of great interest and importance to all labour organizations. The essence of the experiment consists in training its members to a supplementary occupation in addition to their principal occupation in the mills so that in the event of a lock- out, strike or loss of employment otherwise, they would always have something to fall back upon instead of being faced with the prospect of starvation. A mill-hand’s life is ever full of vicisssitudes. Thrift and economy no doubt provide a sort of remedy and it would be criminal to neglect them. But the savings thus made cannot carry one far, seeing that the vast bulk of our mill labourers are always struggling on the margin of bare subsistence. Moreover it would never do for a working man during strike or unemployment to rest idly at home. There is nothing more injurious to his morale and self-respect than enforced idleness. The working class will never feel secure or develop a sense of self-assurance and strength unless its members are armed with an unfailing subsidiary means of subsistence to serve as a second string to their bow in a crisis.
 The idea of a subsidiary occupation for the mill-hands was first conceived by me during the eventful twenty-three days’ strike of the Ahmedabad mill hands in the year 1918. It occurred to me then that  if the strike was to be successful the mill-hands must have  an occupation that would maintain them wholly or partly. They must not
 
 
 rely upon doles. During the strike many of them were employed on unskilled labour. It was then that I mooted my suggestion to teach mill-hands a subsidiary occupation. But my suggestion remained a dead letter till the next strike came. A sort of a beginning was made then. But it was difficult to bring into being all of a sudden an  effective organization for teaching subsidiary occupations. With the end of the second strike died also the effort to find and teach suitable occupations.
 An organized and systematic effort is now being made by the Labour Union in that direction. Mill-hands are being taught to select occupations which they can practise in their leisure hours at home and which would give them substantial relief in times of unemployment. These are ginning, cleaning, carding and spinning of cotton, weaving, tailoring, soap and paper making, type-setting, etc.
 I hold that a working knowledge of a variety of occupations is to the working class what metal is to the capitalist. A lobourer’s skill is his capital. Just as the capitalist cannot make his capital  fructify without the co-operation of labour, even so the working man cannot make his labour fructify without the co-operation of capital. And if both labour and capital have the gift of intelligence equally developed in them and have confidence in their capacity to secure a fair deal, each at the hands of the other, they would get to respect and appreciate each other as equal partners in a common enterprise. They need not regard each other as inherently irreconcilable antagonists. But the difficulty is that whilst today capital is organized and seems to be securely entrenched, labour is not. The intelligence of the working man is cramped by this soulless, mechanical occupation which leaves him little scope or chance to develop his mind. It has prevented him from realizing the power and full dignity of his status. He has been taught to believe that his wages have to be dictated by capitalists instead of his demanding his own terms. Let him only be organized along right lines and have his intelligence quickened, let him learn a variety of occupations, and he will be able to go about with his head erect and never be afraid of being without means of sustenance.
 It is the grossest of superstitions for the working man to believe that he is helpless before the employers. The effort of the Labour Union in Ahmedabad is to dispel this superstition in a  concrete manner. Its experiment, therefore, ought to be welcomed by all concerned. Success will depend on an inflexible determination on the part of the Labour Union to follow up the good beginning that has
 been made, with unflagging perseverance. It must have the right sort of instructors who can arouse among the workers  an  intelligent  interest in their work. A handicraft plied merely mechanically can be as cramping to the mind and soul as any other pursuit taken up mechanically. An unintelligent effort is like a corpse from which the sprit has departed.

473,,MY NOTES,"
    
 IS IT THEN NO MISTAKE?
 Many people seem to have been hurt on reading my note entitled “My Mistake”libtech_562_footnotelibtech_563_footnote. Of course readers of  Harijanbandhu are all Gujaratis. But Gujaratis are scattered in all Provinces and among them those who are alert know the customs and practices of the people in whose midst they live. I have received letters from such persons residing in places as far off as Malabar, Tamilnadu, Andhradesh and Karnataka. All of them write that my presumption was correct. In all these Provinces, amongst Hindus both high and low so-called, not only do marriages take place between a maternal uncle and his niece (sister’s daughter) but these marriages are highly estemed in most cases. One correspondent asked for a lawyer’s opinion. The lawyer wrote back that not only are such marriages customary in the South, but that they are also clearly sanctioned by law.
 Thus, although the correction made by Professor Thakore does not to a certain extent hold good, the manner in which I drew my conclusion was nevertheless faulty. The fact that what I had presumed happens to be true with regard to Hindu society, may be regarded as an accident. From the fact that the children of a brother and sister are permitted to marry, I had no right to conclude that a girl could marry her maternal uncle. Hence Professor Thakore has indeed done me a sevice.
 I can understand the love of the gentlemen who have written to me having regard for my prestige. I thank them for having informed me and I also compliment them for ascertaining the customs and practices of the Provinces in which they happen to reside.
 Because such marriages are acceptable in the South, no one should conclude that the attempt to make them acceptable in places where they are prohibited, will be welcomed. The field for marriages is so wide that where it is prohibited among relatives, there is hardly
 
 
 any need for going against the prohibition. The reforms which Hindu society needs are those concerning the breaking  of inter-caste barriers. These restrictions are truly detrimental to social progress. Hence it would be a real reform to permit inter-provincial and inter- caste marriages.

           SEGAON, 
  [Before 	July 3, 1937]  GANDHIJI: It involved 	intensive education, not in the three Rs, but in changed ways of 	thinking and changed ways of life. To bring about that change in the 	people's mentality is a Herculean task. But it is such because the 	way is the non-violent way, the way of persuasion. This method is 	any day slower than the method of compulsion, but it is also surer 	and stabler.  AMERICAN: 	But would it in any way help if the British were to retire? Would 	you have been better if the British had retired 150 years ago? I 	have no doubt. We should begin anew and without at least the  	political handicap. You talk of the pax Britannica. I 	do not deny that they have introduced education of a sort, have 	built schools and colleges, and built an unrivalled railway system, 	But our difficulty is this, that whereas elsewhere all these things 	have made the countries prosperous, they have brought about an 	opposite result here. Not only the wealth of the land but even our 	intelligence has been drained away. The very life-hope is gone. I 	will not say that a miracle would happen the moment the British 	retire. Only we shall begin our history anew. India will then have 	her destiny in her own hands. And mind you we do not want the 	British to go, if they will stay as friends and voluntary 	co-operators.  But 	why, if they don't want this rule, do they tolerate it? Why is a 	united will lacking? There 	are numerous causes which I cannot go into now. All  	have their share in it, but the root cause is perhaps indefinable. 	The will is actively absent today, though indefinitely it is there.  Have 	the Government reserved to themselves power to overrule the people's 	will because they think that India is incapable of self-government?    
 I do not think so, nor do I suspect that even the British think so. If they did so, they would not have drawn up this Constitution. No, it is an honest effort to make Provinces autonomous. Otherwise why should they arm an electorate of 30 millions with the power to vote? The honest effort is, however, vitiated by the fact that simultaneous effort is being made to maintain the British connection practically by force. And this they do for exploiting India,

493,"July 3, 1937",INTERVIEW TO CAPT. STRUNKlibtech_580_footnote,"
           SEGOAN, 
  [Before 	July 3, 1937]  GANDHIJI: What we mean by 	independence is that we will not live on the sufferance of any 	people on earth and that there is a big party in India which will 	die in vindicating this position. But we will not die killing, 	though we might be killed. It is a novel experiment, I know. Herr 	Hitler, I know, does not accept the position of human dignity being 	maintained without the use of force. Many of us feel that it is 	possible to achieve independence by non-violent means. It would be a 	bad day for the whole world if we had to wade through blood. If 	India gains her freedom by a clash of arms, it will indefinitely 	postpone the day of real peace for the world. History is a record of 	perpetual wars, but we are trying to make new history,and I say this 	as I represent the national mind so far as non-violence is 	concerned. I have reasoned out the doctrine of the sword, I have 	worked out its possibilities and come to the conclusion that man's 	destiny is to replace the law of the jungle with the law of 	conscious love. The  aspiration  for independence is the aspiration 	that fires all nations in Europe. But that independence does not 	exclude voluntary partnership. Imperialistic ambition is 	inconsistent with partnerhip.  Capt. 	Strunk had heard vaguely about Gandhiji's view on machines, and 	Western civilization, Western medicine, etc. He wanted to know them 	at first hand.    
 
 
 
 
 G. I have said that we cannot accept Western models holusbolus. I do not believe in mechanization of India. I think that rural reconstruction is possible!
 STRUNK: Are you lilely to change these views after you have gained your objective of independence?
G. No. These views represent my permanent convictions. But
 my opposition to machinery, railways, etc., does not mean that as soon as we are independent we should uproot all of them. They will be used for the benefit of the nation instead of the strategic military purpose they are principally meant to fulfil today.
 S. Sometimes you direct your speech against Western sanitation and Western surgery. What is your future plan with regard to India?
G. I am glad you have asked the question. I have said nothing
 with regard to Western sanitation. In fact I derived my idea of rural sanitation from Poore, an English doctor, and I have copied it here. But I have spoken against Western medicine which I have called the concentrated essence of black magic. My view springs out of my non- violence, for my soul rebels against vivisection. You do not know that I had very nearly taken the medical line when in order to respect the wishes of my dead father I took up law. But in South Africa I again thought of medicine. When I was told I should have to do vivisection, my soul rebelled against it. Why should, I said, have  to  practise cruelty on lower animals which I would never practise upon myself? But I do not despise all medical treatment. I know that we can learn a lot from the West about safe maternity and the care of infants. Our children are born anyhow and most of our women are ignorant of the science of bringing up children. Here we can learn a good deal from the West.
 But the West attaches an exaggerated importance to prolonging man's earthly existence. Until the man's last moment on earth you go on drugging him even by injecting. That, I think, is inconsistent with the recklessness with which they will shed their lives in war. Though I am opposed to war, there is no doubt that war induces reckless  courage. Well, without ever having to engage in a war I want to learn from you the art of throwing away my life for a noble cause. But I do not want that excessive desire of living that Western medicine seems to encourage in man even at the cost of tenderness for subhuman life. However, I like the emphasis the Western medical science places upon prevention of disease.
 
 
 
 
 
 S. There is so much over-production of intelligence in India and so much educated unemployment. Could not this army of educated young men be utilized by being sent to the villages?
 G. That movement has commenced. But it is only in its infancy. And then there is no over-production of intelligence but over- production of degrees. The brain power has not at all increased, only the art of memorizing has been stimulated, and these degrees can't be carted to the villages. Only the brains, if there are any left, can be used. This reading for degrees has deprived us of initiative. It makes us upfit to go to the villages. The mechanical university study deprives us of the desire for originality; years of memorizing causes a fatigue of the mind that makes most of us fit for clerical work. Nevertheless the village movement has come to stay.
 As Capt. Strunk prepared to leave, Gandhiji introduced him to Mr. Kallenbach.
 G. Here is a live Jew and a German Jew, if you please. He was a hot pro-German during the War.
 Capt. Strunk was surprised to see a German Jew sitting there barebodied and in    a khadi dhoti.
G. Then I should like to understand from you why the Jews are
being persecuted in Germany.
 Capt. Strunk tried to explain. So many Jews had taken part during the War and Germany had nothing to say against them. It is the Jews who overran Germany after the War, who ousted Germans from their jobs, and who ""guided"" the fight against Hitler that were not being tolerated.
 S. I personally think we have just overdone it. That's the mistake revolutions always do. Oh, there is such a lot of hate in Europe. And it has reached its climax in Spain. It is cruel, heartless, stupid, inhuman–this Spanish War. It can't be compared with any other war.

494,,"HINDI V.
URDU","
    
 A correspondent says a great deal is being written against me in the Urdu Press in regard to my attitude towards Urdu. They even go so far to suggest that though I speak about Hindu-Muslim unity I am the most communally minded of all the Hindus.
 I have no desire to defend myself  against  the  suggestion referred to by my correspondent. My life must be my credentials on my attitude regarding the Hindu-Muslim question.
 But the Hindi-Urdu question is an evergreen. Though I have expressed my views often enough on this question, they will bear repetition. I shall simply enunciate my belief without advancing any argument in support.
I believe that
 1. Hindi, Hindustani and Urdu are words denoting the same language spoken in the North by Hindus and Mussalmans and written in either Devanagari or Perisian script;
repetition. I shall simply enunciate my belief without advancing any argument in support.
I believe that
 Hindi, 	Hindustani and 	Urdu are words denoting 	the same language 	spoken in the 	North by 	Hindus and 	Mussalmans and 	written in 	either Devanagari or 	Persian script; Hindi 	was the name for this 	language used 	both by Hindus 	and Mussalmans 	before the word 	Urdu came to be 	used; the 	word Hindustani also 	came to be used 	later (the 	date unknown 	to me) 	to denote 	the same speech; both 	Hindus and 	Mussalmans should 	try to 	speak the 	language as understood by the vast mass of the people in the North; at 	the same 	time many Hindus and 	many Mussalmans 	will persist 	in using Sanskrit 	words and persian 	or Arabic 	words respectively 	and exclusively. 	This we 	shall have to 	bear so 	long as 	mutual distrust 	and aloofness 	continue. Those Hindus 	who care to know 	a certain 	class of Mussalman 	thought will study Urdu written in 	Persian script, and 	similarly those 	Mussalmans who 	care to 	know a 	certain class of 	Hindu thought will 	study Hindi written in 	Devanagari script; ultimately 	when our 	hearts have become one 	and we all 	are proud of 	India as 	our country, 	rather than our 	Provinces, and 	shall know 	and practise different 	religions as derived 	from one common 	source, as 	we know and 	relish different fruits 	of the same 	tree, we shall reach 	a common 	language with a common 	script whilst we shall 	retain provincial 	languages for provincial use; the 	attempt to 	force one 	script or 	one form 	of Hindi 	on any 	Province or 	district or 	people is 	detrimental to 	the best interest 	of the 	country; the 	common language question 	should be viewed 	apart from 	the religious differences; 
 
  Roman 	script cannot and should 	not be 	the common 	script of India. 	The rivalry 	can only 	be berween 	Persian and Devanagari. 	Apart from its intrinsic 	merit the latter 	should be the 	common script for 	all India 	because most 	of the 	provincial scripts 	have their origin 	in Devanagari 	and it 	is for them by 	far the easiest 	to learn. 	At the 	same time no 	attempt whatsoever 	should be 	made to 	foist it upon Mussalmans and for that matter on those others who do not know it.  I 	served the 	cause of 	Urdu, if 	it may be 	distinguished from 	Hindi, when at Indorelibtech_581_footnotelibtech_582_footnotethe Hindi Sahitya Sammelan at my instance accepted the definition given in Clause I, and when at Nagpurlibtech_583_footnotelibtech_584_footnoteat my instance 	the Bharatiya 	Sahitya Parishad 	accepted the definition 	and called 	the common 	langugage of 	inter-provincial 	intercourse Hindi or 	Hindustani, thus 	giving fullest scope to 	both Mussalmans 	and Hindus 	to identify 	themselves with the 	effort to 	enrich the 	common language 	and to 	interpret the 	best provincial thought 	in that language.

 "
495,,A PLEA FOR THE VILLAGE CART,"
    
 Shri Ishverbhai S. Amin of Baroda sends me a long note on animal power v. machine power. From it I copy the following relevant portionlibtech_585_footnote.
 Animal power is not costlier than machine power in fields or short distance work and hence can compete with the latter in most cases. The present-day tendency is towards discarding animal power in preference to machine power.
 Take for example a bullock-driven cart, costing Rs. 100 and Rs. 200 for the bullocks. The bullocks can drive the cart at least 15 miles per day with a load of 16 Bengal maunds on rough sandy village roads. This service will cost.    in total Rs. 1/6 per day., A one ton motor-lorry will cost for 15 mles
 .... Rs. 2/12, i. e., Rs 1/6 per cartload of 16 Bengal maunds	A moror-lorry
 may compete when it has to carry loads at a stretch for a long distance on a good metal road, where bullock carts seem too slow  and uneconomical.	It is
the slowness only which goes againjst the  bulocks cart.	If a farmer has his
 own cart and travels in it, he has not to spend anything in the form of ready money but uses the produce of his own field in producing power by feeding bullocks. Really grass and grain should be looked upon by the farmer as his petrol, and the cart the motor-lorry, and bullocks the engine converting grass into power. The machine will neither consume grass nor will it yield manure,
 
 an article of vast importance. Then the villager has to have his bullocks; in any case he has his grass. And if he has a cart, he is maintaining the village carpenter and the blacksmith; and if he is keeping a cow, he is maintaining a hydrogenation plant converting vagetabele oil into solid butter or ghee and also at the same time a bullock- manufacturing machine-thus serving a twofold purpose.
 The invasion of the motor-lorry may or may not succeed. It would be wisdom if intelligent workers will study the pros and cons and definitely guide the villagers. Shri Ishverbhai’s note should pro- voke the thought of all village workers in the direction indicated in it.
 Harijan, 3-7-1937
 "
496,,WHAT SHOULD BE DONE?,"
    
 The letter, notice and application quoted belowlibtech_586_footnoteare well worth reading.
 I have omitted names and addresses. The correspondent who has written this letter is devoted to ahimsa. This question is pertinent. One who resists the oppressor is, to some extent, saved; but one who has no strength to resist gets beaten. What should a devotee of ahimsa do in such circumstances? Should the oppressed be advised to hit back or at least take the matter to the court? Both these proceedings are lawful. The law allows a person to defend himself if he is illegally assaulted. He of course has the right to go to the court.
 But a devotee of ahimsa will not give such advice. He believes that tit for tat is not the true way of ending oppression in the world. The world has hitherto followed this path; but it has not reduced oppression-only its forms may have changed.
 As devotee of ahimsa will advise the oppressed to resort to non- co-operation. No one can be compelled to slave for another. Hence those Harijans who are oppressed should learn to quit the oppressors’ lands. The questions naturally arises: Where should they go after quitting these lands? It is the duty of a Harijan sevak to find some work or other for such helpless Harijans. This should not be difficult. The path of ahimsa is no doubt difficult, but its ultimate result is permanent and beneficial to both. The world has been returning blow for a blow, but it has neither enhanced happiness not removed  injustice and oppression. My experience tells me that the only way to remove these is ahimsa.
 
 What I have said is the ultimate remedy. But after deciding that blow is no answer for blow and before advising non-co-operation, the non-violent worker will approach the landlords and endeavour to explain to them their duty. It may well be that the landlords may melt a little. Public opinion can be roused against such oppression when the oppressor becomes stubborn and refuses to listen to anyone; then the best remedy is non-co-operation, that is, getting on without him.
 It need not be feared that when oppressed Chamars resort to non-co-operation the other castes would join hands with the  oppressor. At the moment the question is only of the oppressed. If others do join hands, they too can be taught the lesson of non-co- operation.

498,,HOLIDAYS,"
    
 Students have always the problem of how to spend their school vacations. Shri Narnadas Gandhi’s letter quoted belowlibtech_587_footnotelibtech_588_footnotetells us how some students of the Rajkot National School spent their vacation.
 
 
 I would look upon this programme as a commendable one. In this way students gained prectical knowledge and developed their intellect, as the work they did seems to have been done intelligently and with keen zest. Very often during vacations students spend huge sums on railway fares and travel to distant places and return empty- handed. It will be no small gain if they come to know the villages and the villagers in their own neighbourhood, serve them and carry out propaganda for the charkha and sanitation.

 APPENDIX I
 RESOLUTION PASSED AT A.I.C.C. MEETING, DELHIlibtech_600_footnote
 March 16, 1937 The All-India Congress Committee records its high appreciation of the magnificent response of the country to the call of the Congress during the recent
 elections and the approval by the electorate of the Congress policy and programme.
 The Congress entered these elections with its objective of independence and its total rejection of the new Constitution; and the demand for a Constituent Assembly to frame India’s Constitution. The declared Congress policy was to combat the new Act and end it. The electorate has, in an overwhelming majority, set its seal of approval on this policy and programme, and the new Act, therefore, stands condemned and utterly rejected by the people through the self-same democratic process which has been invoked by the British Government, and the people have further declared that they desire to frame their own constitution, based on national independence, through the medium of a Constituent Assembly elected by adult franchise. This Committee, therefore, demands on behalf of the people of India that the new Constitution be withdrawn.
 In the event of the British Government still persisting with the new Constitution in defiance of the declared will of the people, the All-India Congress Committee desire to impress upon all Congress members of the Legislatures that their work inside and outside the Legislatures must be based on the fundamental Congress policy of combating the new Constitution and seeking to end it, a policy on the basis of which they sought the suffrage of the electorate and won their overwhelming victory in elections. That policy must inevitably lead to deadlocks with the British Government and bring out still further the inherent antagonism between British Imperialism and Indian Nationalism and expose the autocratic nature of the new Consititution.libtech_601_footnote
 THE BACKGROUND
 While the British Governments’ reform as proposed in the Government of India Act (1935) had been totally rejected by the Bombay Congress session, at the Working Committee meeting held at Allahabad in April, 1936, the members differed widely in their views on the subject of office-acceptance. In the absence of a consensus, it was decided to review the matter after the elections in February, 1937. When the results of the elections were announced, the Congress had the majority of seats in five Provinces, namely, Madras, the United Provinces, the  Central Provinces, Bihar and Orissa. It was the biggest single Party in four Provinces,
 
 
 namely, Bombay, Bengal, Assam and North-West Frontier Province. In the Legislative Assmeblies of Sind and the Punjab, the Congress was in a minority. The following extract from the The History of the Indian National Congress, shows the Party position in various Assemblies:
 TOTAL NO. OF SEATS
 IN THE LEGISLATIVE	SEATS WON BY THE
 PROVINCE	ASSEMBLY	CONGRESS
 Madras	215	159
 Bihar	152	98
 Bengal	250	54

 Punjab	175	18
 N.W.F.P	50	19
 Sind	60	7
 Assam	108	33
 Orissa	60	36
 The following is extracted from the resolution passed by the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee in Madras on March 10, 1937:
 “The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee is convinced on good grounds that the people of this Province, who have expressed their unqualified confidence in the Congress leadership, are strongly and definitely in favour of the Congress Party accepting ministerial responsibilities with a view to carrying out the policy of the Congress and the programme laid down in the Congress manifesto, and that they will be extremely disappointed if any other decision is adopted.
 “The Provincial Congress Committee is of the opinion that accepting the ministerial offices by the Congress in Legislatures will strengthen the Congress Party and develop the sanctions necessary for achieving the Congress goal, by creating the psychology of confidence between the masses and  the  forces  of repression that have been hitherto employed against them by the bureaucracy . . .
 “The Provincial Congress Committee therefore is clearly of the opinion that in all the Provinces where Congressmen are in majorities in Provincial Legislatures, so as to enable them to function as stable Ministries without having to depend upon doubtful non-Congress groups, the Congressmen should accept ministerial offices on behalf of the Party.”
 In his speech on the A.I.C.C. resolution, C. Rajagopalachari said:
 “ Let us not distrust each other. Do not think we are hankering after
 jobs	When they went to the Governor they had to tell him what they proposed to
 
 do and ask him if he would use his special powers. If the Governor refused to give an answer, they would come back. If he said he would use them, then also as self- respecting men they would come back; but if he said he would not use them, they would take his words at their face value. If later he broke those words, they could come out. . .”
 Jawaharlal Nehru said that “though he also continued the opposition . . . he eventually agreed again in deference to the wishes of Mahatma Gandhi and with a view to keeping up solidarity, which, in his view, was essential to fight the new Constitution.”
 The A.I.C.C. then “took up consideration of the draft of the oath which every Congress Legislator will be required to take affirming allegiance to Congress and the country on the first day of the National Convention Session.” The draft, prepared by Jawaharlal Nehru and revised by Gandhiji, read:
 “I, Member of this All-India Convention, pledge myself to the service of India and to work in the Legislatures and outside for the independence of India and the ending of the exploitation and poverty of her people.
 “I pledge myself to work under the discipline of the Congress for the furtherance of Congress ideals and objectives to the end that India may be free and independent and her millions freed from the heavy burdens they suffer from.”
 Pattabhi Sitaramayya explains thus the question of “assurances”:
 “Apart from the question of the academic and theoretical issues involved in this affair, it would be just as well to study in detail the significance of the demands made by the Congress that the Governors shall not use their special powers of interference or set aside the advice of Ministers in regard to the constitutional activities. These special powers relate to certain groups, interests and areas. The groups are the minorities, the interests are the vested interests of the British and the areas are the excluded and the semi-excluded areas in British India, and the Indian States. By this demand it is meant that the Governors should only act like the Governors in the Provinces of Australia (Section 51). They should not have the power to dismiss Ministers at their pleasure, that the salaries should be fixed as desired by the leader of the House (Section 50), that they should not preside over the Council of Ministers, that they should not interfere or make Ordinances (Section 55- 88), or Acts on grounds of menace to peace and tranquillity, that they had nothing to do with the appointment of Advocate-General (Section 56), or with the making of the police rules:
 (Section 57) with violent crimes
 (	”	59) with the framing of rules of business allocating the duties of Ministers
 (	”	62) dissolving the Assembly (	”	74) introduction of Bills
 (	”	75) assenting to Bills
 (	”	78) inclusion of extra amounts of expenditure in the budget
 ( ” 82) introducing a Bill or an amendment to  a  Bill increasing  or  imposing any tax or borrowing money except on the recommendation of Ministers
 (	”	84) making rules for legislative procedure with the consultation of the Speaker
 (	”	86) interference with any Bill as trenching upon Governor’s special charge
 (	”	88)  Governor’s Ordinances (	”	90) Governor’s Acts
 (	”	92) Excluded Areas
 (	” 258) the privileges of Services.”

 APPENDIX II
 LORD LOTHIAN’S LETTER TO “THE TIMES”libtech_602_footnote
 The statementlibtech_603_footnoteseems to be based on a complete misunderstanding of the way in which the system of responsible government works in practice and of paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Instrument of Instructions to Governors.
 Responsible government has been the method by which the Canadian and Australian Federation and South Africa and New Zealand each have attained full national self-government by constitutional means, often in the early days against the opposition both of Governors and the British Government. In every  case  the Governor or Governor-General was endowed with veto powers and other responsibilities of his own.
 I venture to assert that in no case has a Ministry possessed of a majority in the Legislature asked, and that it certainly never received, any assurance that the Governor would not use his special powers. Yet these powers and responsibilities in the hands of Governors have not prevented steady advance to full self-government.
 That is because the issue turns not so much on the legal power as on the responsibility—that responsibility, Mr. Gandhi once told me himself, was India’s first need to exercise.
 I do not think, therefore, that Mr. Gandhi had hitherto any legitimate ground for saying that the British Government flouted the majority or failed to give effect to the principle of provincial autonomy.
 
 Governors simply acted in the manner always contemplated at the Round Table Conference and repeatedly proclaimed by Ministers as being the ordinary practice under the system of responsible Government.
 I am sure that British public opinion hopes and expects that majorities returned by the new electorate will take over responsibility under the Constitution for the Government of their Provinces. If Congress leaders take the course ordinarily adopted under responsible government and, without asking for assurances, accept office, formulate their practical proposals of reform, pass them into law and advise the Governor that they will find themselves endowed with both power and responsibility for the Government of their Provinces, I am sure Mr. Gandhi will find by following this step that he will have taken a tremendous step towards that transference of power from the bureaucracy to the largest and fullest democracy known  in the world which he hopes to bring about.

APPENDIX III
 EXTRACTS FROM THE CONGRESS ELECTION MANIFESTOlibtech_604_footnote
 August 22, 1936 For more than fifty years the Indian National Congress has laboured for the freedom of India, and ever, as its strength grew and it came to represent more and more
 the nationalist urge of the Indian people and their desire to put an end to exploitation
 by British Imperialism, it came into conflict with the ruling power. During the recent years the Congress has led great movements for national freedom and has sought to develop sanctions whereby such freedom can be achieved by peaceful mass action and the disciplined sacrifice and suffering of the Indian people. To the lead of the Congress the Indian people have responded in an abundant measure and  thus  confirmed their inherent right to freedom. That struggle for freedom still continues and must continue till India is free and independent.
 These years have seen the development of an economic crisis in India and the world which has led to a progressive deterioration in the condition of all classes of our people. The poverty-stricken masses are today in the grip of an even more abject poverty and destitution, and this growing disease urgently and insistently demands a radical remedy. Poverty and unemployment have long been the lot of our peasantry and industrial workers; today they cover and crush other classes also—the artisan, the trader, the small merchant, the middle-class intelligentsia. For the vast millions of our countrymen the problem of achieving national independence has become an
 
 
 
 urgent one, for only independence can give us the power to solve our economic and social problems and end the exploitation of our masses.
 The growth of the national movement and the economic crisis have resulted in the intense repression of the Indian people and the suppression of civil liberties, and the British Government has sought to strengthen the imperialist bonds that envelop India and to prepetuate the domination and exploitation of the Indian people by enacting the Government of India Act of 1935. . . .
 In the international sphere crisis follows crisis in an ever-deepening degree and world-war hangs over the horizon. The Lucknow Congress called the attention of the nation to this grave situation in India and the world, and declared its opposition  to the participation of India in an imperialist war and its firm resolve to continue the struggle for the independence of India.
 The Congress rejected in its entirety the Constitution imposed upon India by the new Act and declared that no constitution imposed by outside authority and no constitution which curtails the sovereignty of the people of India, and does not recognize their right to shape and control fully their political and economic future, can be accepted. Such a constitution, in its opinion, must be based on the independence of India as a nation and it can only be framed by a Constituent Assembly.
 The Congress has always laid stress on the development of the strength of the people and the forging of sanctions to enforce the people’s will. To this end it has carried on activities outside the Legislatures. The Congress holds that real strength comes from thus organizing and serving the masses.
 Adhering to this policy and objective, but in view of the present situation and in order to prevent the operation of forces calculated to strengthen alien domination and exploitation, the Congress decides to contest seats in the coming elections for the provincial Legislatures. But the purpose of sending Congressmen to the Legislatures under the new Act is not to co-operate in any way with the Act but to combat it and seek to end it. It is to carry out, in so far as is possible, the Congress policy of rejection of the Act, and to resist British imperialism in its attempts to strengthen its hold on India and its exploitation of the Indian people. In the opinion of the Congress, activity in the Legislatures should be such as to help in the work outside, in the strengthening of the people, and in the development of the sanctions which are essential to freedom.
 The new Legislatures, hedged and circumscribed by safeguards and special powers for the protection of British and other vested interests, cannot yield substantial benefits, and they are totally incapable of solving the vital problems of poverty and unemployment. But they may well be used by British imperialism for its own purposes to the disadvantage and injury of the Indian people. The Congress representatives will seek to resist this, and to take all possible steps to end the various regulations, Ordinances and Acts which oppress the Indian  people  and smother their will to freedom. They will work for the establishment of civil liberty, for the release of political prisoners and detenus, and to repair the wrongs done to the peasantry and to public institutions in the course of national struggle.
 The Congress realizes that independence cannot be achieved through these Legislatures, nor can the problem of poverty and unemployment be effectively
 tackled by them. Nevertheless the Congress places its general programme before the people of India so that they may know what it stands for and what it will try to achieve, whenever it has the power to do so . . .
 Pending the formulation of a fuller programme, the Congress reiterates its declaration made at Karachi—that it stands for a reform of the system of land tenure and rent and an equitable adjustment of the burden on agricultural land, giving immediate relief to the smaller peasantry by a substantial reduction of agricultural rent and revenue now paid by them and exempting uneconomic holdings from  payment of rent and revenue. . . .
 The communal decision, which forms part of the new Act, has led to much controversy and the Congress attitude towards it has been misunderstood by some people. The rejection in its entirety of the new Act by the Congress inevitably involves the rejection of the communal decision. Even apart from the Act as a whole the communal decision is wholly unacceptable as being inconsistent  with independence and the principle of democracy. . . .
 The Congress therefore, holds that the right way to deal with the situation created by the communal decision is to intensify our struggle for independence and, at the same time, to seek a common basis for an agreed solution which helps to strengthen the unity of India. . . .
 The question of accepting Ministers or not in the new Legislatures was postponed for a decision by the Lucknow Congress. The A.I.C.C. is of opinion that it will be desirable for this decision to be taken after the elections. What- ever the decision on this question might be, it must be remembered that, in any event, the Congress stands for the rejection of the new Act, and for no co-operation in its working. The object remains the same—the ending of the Act. With a view to this end every endeavour will be made to prevent the introduction and functioning of the federal part of the scheme, which is intended to perpetuate the domination  of imperialist interests and the feudal interests of the States over the whole country and prevent all progress towards freedom. It must be borne in mind  that  the  new provincial Assemblies will form the electorate for the proposed federal central Legislature and the composition of those provincial Legislatures will materially affect the fate of the federal Constitution. . . .
 With this great and inspiring goal before us, for which so many men and women of India have suffered and sacrificed their all under the banner of the Congress, and for which today thousands of our countrymen are suffering silently and with brave endurance, we call upon our people with full hope and confidence to rally to the cause of the Congress, of India, of freedom.

 APPENDIX IV
 LORD ZETLAND’S SPEECHlibtech_605_footnote
 May 6, 1937
 If a quasi-legal formula could be devised to regulate the varied and changing relationships between the Governor and his Ministry, it would have been embodied in the Act. It was just because there was no such formula that it was emphasized again and again in the course of the discussions preceding the Bill that it would be the spirit in which the Constitution was worked that would be of the first importance for its success. It is here that such unfortunate misunderstandings have arisen. In some quarters a great deal more has been read into that part of the Act which imposes certain obligations upon a Governor that it actually contains.
 In its most recent pronouncement, the Congress declared that the past record and the present attitude of the British Government showed that without the assurances demanded a popular Ministry would be exposed to constant irritating interference. This differs so profoundly from the picture of a popular Ministry functioning under the Act as I have always seen it that it is perhaps desirable that I should describe the working of the Constitution in Indian Provinces as I always contemplated it. Since I was a member not only of the Select Committee, but the Round Table Conference, I may claim to know something of the intentions of those who framed the measure and the spirit in which it was conceived.
 First let it not be supposed that the field of Government may be divided into two parts in which the Governor and Ministry operate separately at the risk of clashes between them. The essence of the new Constitution is that the initiative and responsibility for the whole Government of the Province, though in form vested in the Governor, passes to the Ministry as soon as it takes office. It will be the Governor’s duty to help Ministers in their task in every way, particularly by his political experience or administrative knowledge.
 The reserved powers of which so much has been made by the Congress will not normally be in operation; indeed they only come into the picture if he considers that the carefully limited special responsibilities laid upon him by the Act and impressed upon him by the Instrument of Instructions are involved, but even if the question of their use does arise—here is emphasized the spirit in which it was intended that the Constitution should be worked—it would be altogether wrong to assume that a Governor would immediately set himself in open opposition to his Ministry.
 
 That is the last thing in the world that I should either expect or desire. A Governor whose advice and support has been valuable to a Ministry in the conduct of its own affairs will surely be able to lay his own difficulties before them the moment he sees a risk that he and his Ministers may not see eye to eye in a matter for which special responsibility has been laid upon him by parliament. Just as Ministers can count upon the assistance of the Governor in their difficulties, so could he in his turn rely upon receiving the sympathetic consideration of his Ministers for a difficulty in his own position which, maybe, could be met by some modification  of  their proposals that would not materially affect the Ministry’s programme.
 In any case a discussion of the matter between men working together for a common purpose is likely at least to secure that points of difference between them are narrowed. It will then be for each having regard to the interests of the Province as a whole to consider whether the points of difference so narrowed and defined justify a break in a fruitful relationship. It would doubtless be too much to hope that occasions will never arise in which neither side can with good conscience give way. But if my picture of the working of Government under the Act is true and if the relations between the Governor and his Ministry are those of partners in a common enterprise, there can be no possible question of the Governors interfering constantly and embarrassingly in the responsibilities and work of the Ministries.
 It is certainly not the intention that Govenors by a narrow or legalistic interpretation of their own responsibilities should trench upon the wide power which  it was the purpose of parliament to place in the hands of Ministries and which it is our desire they should use in the furtherance of the programmes which they advocated. In the working of the Constitution as far as it at present is possible to judge, I find happy confirmation of the picture as I have always seen it.
 Both in the Provinces in which Ministries are working with majorities in the Legislatures and those in which minority Ministries are functioning, a bold programme has been drawn up as far as I know without the smallest attempt on the part of any Governor to interfere.
 Is it too much to hope that those who have so far hesitated to accept responsibilities of office from a mistaken sense of fear lest they should be unduly hampered in their tasks will derive reassurance and encouragement from the object- lesson provided by the actual working of the Constitution in their midst? I need hardly say that I hope devoutly and in all sincerity that it may be so.

 APPENDIX V
 KOODALMANIKKAM TEMPLE CONTROVERSYlibtech_606_footnote
 At Irinjalakuda in the Cochin State there is an ancient and important Hindu temple known as the Koodalmanikkam Devaswom. The Devaswom owns extensive lands in Travancore, Cochin and Malabar. The management of the affairs of the Temple, both spiritual and temporal, is vested in a person who is designated the Thachudaya Kaimal which literally means the Chief of Lord, who owns the building (Temple). This person is appointed by His Highness the Maharaja of Travancore in exercise of His Highness’s immemorial right recognized and confirmed by the treaties between Travancore and Cochin in 1761, 1765 and 1805.
 The nomination and consecration of the Kaimal are no mere secular acts but are attended with elaborate ceremonies which have deep religious significance and are relevant in indicating the status of the Kaimal in relation to the Temple.       By virtue
 of the nomination and consecration ceremonies, the nominee, who was originally a Nair by birth, becomes clothed with the spiritual dignity and status of the highest Brahmin, and his spiritual eminence is considered superior even to that of His Highness the Maharaja of Cochin. For according to tradition even his Highness the Maharaja of Cochin has to touch the pole of the Kaimal’s palanquin just when the Kaimal enters it to be taken in procession round the Temple. He assumes the name of the deity and is called Manikkam Keralan and manages the spiritual and temporal
 affairs of the Devaswom. When he dies purificatory ceremonies are performed in the Temple and Brahmins perform the cremation ceremony; and sraddham for the dead Kaimal is performed in the Temple. The idea is that with the consecration the Kaimal becomes the visible representative of the presiding deity.
 With the death of a former Kaimal in 1850, disputes arose as to the right of the Maharaja of Travancore to appoint the successor. The contention was put forward by Cochin that the Kaimal had no right of management of the Temple and that the right  to nominate the Kaimal could be exercised by Travancore only when the Temple building itself stood in need of repair. Travancore repudiated this plea and asserted the right of the Maharaja of Travancore to appoint a Kaimal to be in management of the spiritual and temporal affairs of the Temple whenever that office fell vacant. The matter  was  referred  to  arbitration;  and  after  protracted   enquiry,   the   Abritrator Mr. J.C. Hannyngton decided that Cochin’s contentions were untenable, that the Travancore nominee had entire management and control of the whole of the Temple concerns and its endowments. . . . The Kaimal was then appointed and duly consecrated, but Cochin again contested before its own local courts the right of the Kaimal to institute suits on behalf of the Devaswom or to collect the rents and profits independently of the Yogakkars, who, it was alleged, were still the owners of the Temple. Travancore contended that the Kaimal was the supreme spiritual and
 temporal  authority  of   the   Koodalmanikkam  Temple   and  had   the   sole   right  of
 
 management of all affairs concerning the Temple and that the status and powers of the Kaimal did not depend on the pronouncement of the Municipal Courts of Cochin. . . .
 The Madras Government accepted the contentions of the Travancore Government. . . . The Resident was directed to advise the Cochin Durbar to restore to the Kaimal by legislation or proclamation the powers of which he had been found to have been deprived by the judicial decisions in Cochin. The Cochin Durbar took the matter in appeal before the Secretary of State who confirmed the decision of the Madras Government.
 Meanwhile, the Kaimal who was then in office died and another Kaimal had to be appointed. The States could not agree as to the best method of providing such
 control and eventually, after long-pending negotiations, it was agreed that the  British Resident might be constituted as the Controlling Authority with reference specially to the management of the properities and incomes belonging to the Devaswom.
 A scheme of management was accordingly drawn up and agreed to by all the parties concerned in which the spiritual authority of the Kaimal as “the chief religious authority to clear all doubts in connection with the internal management of the temple” was expressly affirmed and provision was made whereby (a) the Kaimal was not to exceed a certain scale of personal expenditure prescribed for him, (b) the Kaimal had to keep correct accounts of all receipts and expenditure and submit financial statements, as audited, to the Governments of Travancore and Cochin and to the Controlling Authority, (c) the Kaimal was subject to be removed by the Controlling Authority, from the management of the Devaswom properties and  incomes if, on enquiry in the manner prescribed in the scheme, the Kaimal was found guilty of mismanagement and misconduct which rendered his further continuance in control of the Temple undesirable. The only right of the Yogakkars recognized in the scheme was that the annual accounts should be read out from the Temple to the
 Yogakkars on a prescribed day of every year.
 This, in brief, is the present position of the Kaimal; and the Kaimal now in office functions under the provisions of the scheme outlined above. It will thus be clear that after a dispute which lasted for over seventy years the status and functions of the Kaimal, both spiritual and temporal, were finally settled  when  the proclamation and scheme of management were promulgated in 1917. Everything was calm and smooth until some time after the Travancore Temple-entry Proclamation.
 There was no question that the Kaimal was not the supreme spiritual authority to regulate and settle all matters of a religious nature. But when tantris who had officiated   in   Travancore   temples  entered   and  officiated   in   the Koodalmanikkam
 Temple, Cochin revived the contention as to the  Yogakkar’s  right  to  control the
 Kaimal’s action in regard to religious practices and to issue directions to him. On representations made by some of them, His Highness the Maharaja of Cochin declared on the 15th April that the Temple was polluted because a tantri who officiated in a Travancore temple which was open to avarnas had officiated in the Koodalmanikkam Temple, and that purificatory ceremony in the Temple   was  necessary   before   the
 utsavam  festival could commence.   The  vazhivadoos  or   offerings   of   the Cochin
 Maharaja were also ordered to be withdrawn until further orders. On the 17th April, the Resident issued directions to the Kaimal asking the latter to follow the instructions
 issued by the Maharaja of Cochin. The Kaimal obeyed the directions of the Resident. Encouraged obviously by the action of the Resident, the Cochin Government again issued orders to the Kaimal to prohibit the entry into the Temple or the tank of all persons who had participated in ceremonies in Travancore temples, unless they performed prayaschittam. The Kaimal protested against the action of the Cochin Maharaja and complained about the scope of the Resident’s orders. . . .
 Travancore had no concern with the action taken by the Cochin Government with respect to the subjects of the Cochin State and was merely interested  in preserving the authority which the Kaimal assumed when he was invested with that office on nomination by His Highness the Maharaja of Travancore. According to Travancore, the only authority competent to declare whether under the circumstances there was pollution or not and whether purificatory ceremony was required or not was the Kaimal as the spiritual head of the Devaswom—a position affirmed even in the scheme promulgated by the Cochin Maharaja with the consent of Travancore and the British Government. Any order passed by the Maharaja of Cochin or the Resident without reference to the Kaimal and opposed to his (Kaimal’s) own declaration would be ineffective and without jurisdiction.
 The Resident has subsequently made his position clear as is evident from the interviews given by him to the Press. The direction given by him to the Kaimal did not purport to be an interference with the exercise of the discretion vested in the Kaimal in religious matters but were intended to maintain status quo mainly as aprecautionary measure to preserve law and order. . . .
 According to Travancore, the powers of the Resident as Controlling Authority are limited to those expressly specified in the Scheme and no proper occasion had arisen for the intervention of the Resident either as Controlling Authority or as representative of the Paramount Power, for, in either capacity, the Resident had no jurisdiction in giving directions on religious matters solely within the cognizance of the Kaimal. If there was any apprehension of breaches of the peace, there is nothing to show that the Cochin Government could not have dealt with the situation adequately. The Kaimal himself has stated in an interview that even without the Resident’s intervention the Utsavam festival would have passed off peacefully, and that this would have been possible even though some of the sanatanist tantris had non-co-operated.
 The Kaimal has subsequently exercised his discretion and declared that in the circumstances stated there was no pollution whatever. Travancore contends that this declaration finally settles the controversy and that the Resident having substantially upheld the discretionary authority of the Kaimal in spiritual matters Travancore has no more any reason to complain. . . .
 It may be of interest to note that even in the not distant past there have been instances when ancient religious customs and usages have been departed from in Cochin on the ground that they were unreasonable. Men who had cropped their hair and men who had crossed the sea had no admission into temples in Cochin. But the prohibition does not now exist. The ground on which, in the present case, the Maharaja of Cochin declared in favour of pollution, is not sanctioned by the Shastras or by usage.
