In reply, Shri Aurobindo wrote in pencil on the note : “Yes, I wrote to him a short letter explaining the nature of my retirement and regretting that I could not break my rule as long as the reason for it existed. It was addressed to Bangalore, I believe, and ought to have reached him, unless it has been pocketed by the C.I.D. I suppose even if he had left Banaglore it would have been forwarded to him. You can write and inform him of the fact.”"
