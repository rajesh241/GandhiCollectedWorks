  LETTER TO NARAYANAPPA 
 June 16, 1932
 There is nothing like finding one’s full satisfaction from one’s daily task however humble it may be. To those that wait and watch and pray, God always brings greater tasks and responsibilities.

  LETTER TO PARASRAM MEHROTRA 
 June 16, 1932
 CHI. PARASRAM,
 I have not yet received your booklet. Mahadev will go through the Press cutting. Do something about the swellinglibtech_11_footnoteand cure it.
 You did quite right in not running up to Vimal’slibtech_12_footnoteelder brother, but you yourself should feel so. The knowledge that he is under the care of your brother and that the latter is looking after him properly should be enough for you. If you have some special remedy for his illness or if you think that your very presence will cure him, then it may be your duty to go. That is, if you can become free from your work you should go in such circumstances. You should go, however, not only for the sake of Vimal’s brother but for any person who may be ill and whose illness is likely to be cured by your presence. It is only thus that one learns to overcome the weakness of one’s heart. Let us hope that the child is all right now.
 I think that it would be desirable to fix the maximum number of hours for work, it that is possible. But it seems to me that the limit would be different for each person. In an institution in which all the members regard one another as members of a family and everybody has the same sense of responsibility, it would not only be impossible, but may even be improper to fix a uniform limit for all. How can weframe a rule which would not permit a person, whose health is good enough, who is himself willing and who has no other work of service to claim his time, to give all his time to the service of the institution? The conclusion which I draw from this is that, if we exercise discretion
 
 in all our work, do it calmly and selflessly and without hurry, no one would feel the burden of work. We feel work to be a burden only when we do it under compulsion. Work done willingly and cheerfully is never felt as a burden. But those who have a demoniac nature are impelled by their selfishness to take all manner of work from their body and then break down. Such persons have no peace of mind and we should never take them as examples.
 The line about women which you have quoted has no other sense but what I have explained.libtech_13_footnoteIt is true only for lustful men. There is no injustice in saying that for immoral men, women are a mine of evil, just as for the greedy, a mine of gold is like hell. For the world, however, it is not so. Gold is useful in many ways."

The X-rays seem to have had miraculous 	effect on you. Your health should improve repidly now. But it may be 	wrong to believe that, because the rays have proved beneficial in 	one disease, they would help in my complaint too. They may or may 	not. Here in the prison my body is in the hands of the 	Superintendent. Let him take such measures as he thinks may help. 	They seem to have no fear and believe that the pain in the elbow 	will disappear if it is givencomplete rest. The pain is not 	continuous. The elbow pains only when I do a particular type of work 	with the arm.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: S.N. 9782     
  
          CHI. 	DEVDAS,   LETTER TO DEVDAS GANDHI     June 	16, 1932 
  	I did fear some such thing. I had a feeling the day before yesterday 	that there would be bad news from somewhere. And then I got your 	wire yesterday. I immediately asked Vallabhbhai what the wire 	contained, and on opening it he read the news about your illness. It 	was not likely that you would escape fever in Gorakhpur. But I 	assume that it will have left you before you get this letter. I 	think that, according to your nature, you would like to be 	surrounded by friends and relations at such a time. You would 	deserve such care becuase you have looked after many people in their 	illness. But I myself am a hard-hearted man. I, therefore, would not 	like to ask anybody from the western part to run up to Gorakhpur. 	And if I did feel such a wish, I would suppress it. If I don’t 	practise my philosophy on you, on whom else should I? I wish that 	you should understand this nature of mine and bear it cheerfully. 	God is your relations and your friends and your parents; all others 	are so only in name. Themselves helpless creatures, how can they 	help you? Instead of lookiing to such cyphers for protection and 	support, seek the protection of the Universal Power. He will send 	you such help as He wills. It is my firm faith that, wherever you 	are, you will draw your neighbours towards you. There is no reason 	to believe that it will be otherwise in jail.  	After saying this, I suggest that, if you want anybody from the 	Ashram to be near you, send a wire there. But my hope is that by the 	time you get this letter your illness will have been a thing of the 	past.  	You always have the blessing of us all.libtech_15_footnote[From Gujarati]  Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, Vol. I, p. 220              
  
  A LETTERlibtech_16_footnote 
 June 16, 1932
 The story about the snake is correct only to a certain extent. The snake was passing over my body. At such a moment what could I or anyone else do except to remain still? I don’t see that this deserves any such praise as the writer has given me. And how do we know if the snake was poisonous or not? Having held for years that death is not a frightening event I am not affected for long by the death of anyone."

          CHI. 	PREMA,   LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK   June 	17, 1932 
  	What else am I to believe but that you are a fool? If children have 	no interest in asking questions and still write, they waste their 	time. If they write with interest, though merely as a formality, 	there is some meaning in that. Children may not expect letters from 	parents, but are bound to be glad when they get one. There will be 	no trace of selfishness in this. In any case, you cannot see in this 	evidence of hysteria. I have explained to you in one of my letters 	what your hysteria is.libtech_20_footnote  	I have not opposed contemplation of a personal form at the time of 	prayers, but have given a higher place to the formless. Perhaps it 	is not right to make such a distinction. What suits one person will 	not suit another. Comparison is out of place in this matter.  For  	me  worship of the formless has greater appeal. Your explanation 	regarding Sankara and Ramanuja does not  seem  correct.libtech_21_footnotelibtech_22_footnotePersonal 	experience is more important than the influence of external circums- 	tances. The latter should have no effect on a votary of truth. He 	ought to see beyond them. We often see that opinions formed on the 	basis of external circumstances are afterwards discovered to be 	wrong. The connection between the atmanlibtech_23_footnotelibtech_24_footnoteand 	the body is a well-known instance of this. Because the atman is 	intimately connected with the body in this life, we cannot easily 	think of it as distinct from the body. No one has equalled the power 	of vision of the person who saw beyond this outward fact and first 	uttered: “Not this”. You will be able to think      towards 	God had changed 	with the change 	in social 	and political 	conditions. Sankara lived 	in an age of freedom when people talked of equality with God; 	Ramanuja lived in an age 	of slavery 	when people talked of 	being the 	slaves of 	the slaves 	of God. 	In the 	book Bapuna 	Patro-5: Ku. 	Premabehn Kantakne, 	pp. 99-101, 	however,  the 	addressee, presumably relying on 	her memory, 	says that she 	had argued that both 	Sankara and 	Ramanuja could attain 	greater heights of 	spirituality because they 	lived in 	an age of 	freedom where as 	the later 	saints, being born in 	slavery, worshipped 	personal gods and 	not the abstract Brahman.  
 of any number of such instances. It is not at all proper to take literally the utterances of Tukaram and other saints. Recently I read one such utterance of Tukaram. I quote it for your benefit.
 An image of Lord Pashupati is made out of clay: what, then, would clay called?
 The worship of the Lord reaches unto Him, the clay remains clay.
 An image of Vishnu is carved out of stone, yet the stone does not become Vishnu.
 The devotion is offered to Vishnu, the stone remains a stone.
 From this, I draw the lesson that we should pay attention only to the idea behind the words of such saints. They may describe personal God and yet worship the formless. We ordinary human beings cannot do that and, therefore, we would come to grief if we do not try to understand their real meaning and guide ourselves by it.
 If a person who can read Urdu goes to Imam Saheb’s house, he will soon find the books. You have there Mirabehn’s Urdu-English and English-Urdu Dictionary. Send that, too, along with the other books. Does anyone clean Imam Saheb’s house periodically? Every unoccupied house should be cleaned once a week or a fortnight.
 You will find it difficult to keep an account of time only till it has become a habit with you to do so. Afterwards, it shouldn’t take any time. Such things have a value and bear fruit only if they are done in the right spirit.
 I cite the example of children in South Africa in order to encourage the children in the Ashram and not to find fault with them. These children, too, are capable of working, if we have anyone among us who knows how to take work from them. Aren’t you there?
 For the pain in your back, you should sit in warm water. You should do that for fifteen to twenty minutes. At the same time you should massage the back with your palm. If you do this, your pain will be cured and there will also be a  beneficial  effect  on menstruation. Let me know what the doctor says. Such diseases should be effectively treated at the very first appearance of their symptoms.
 I carefully examined your daily programme of work. It is much too heavy. You can easily make a few cuts in it. From 12.30 to 5.40 you run a class and give instruction in crafts. That comes to five hours and ten minutes. If you reduce this period by one hour, you will get the free time which you need. You may retire into privacy and
 have a nap or simply lie down for one hour, or do some work which makes you feel that you are resting. You should not, however, spend the time in talking or in any serious work. If you do not wish to utilize the free hour just then, you may advance the time of those items of the programme for which it is convenient to do so and get an hour in the evening. Anyone who feels completely absorbed in his or her work does not feel it a burden or a strain, but to one who feels no interest in his work even a small task seems heavy, as a day seems as long as a year to a prisoner. To a person given to worldly enjoyments,  a year seems as short as a day!
 In the past, I used to get bored when listening to European music. It is only now that I can understand and enjoy it a little.
 You are not right when you say that “one should not hope to do any reading here.” It is quite true that you cannot do much reading. It is equally true that reading is given less importance in the Ashram. Even so, many prisons in the Ashram have been able to do some reading. I do not like your expressions of  despair.  Try  to perfect what you find imperfect. If, however, on the balance you feel that things are unsatisfactory, if, that is, after weighing the good points against the shortcomings, you feel that the latter exceed, you should leave the Ashram. Justice to oneself and to society requires that.
 You need not apologize for your long letters. They don’t bore me; on the contrary, I like them. I learn something from them, for each of them mirrors the state of your heart at the time of writing it.

  A LETTER 
 June 17, 1932
 You ought not to lose your self-confidence. One often gets impure thoughts. But those who frequently clean out the dust that daily settles in their houses may be said to be clean and keeping their houses clean. Similarly, those who drive out impure thoughts from their minds as soon as they come are sure to win in their struggle. They should not be called hypocrites. To save oneself  from hypocrisy, I have already suggested a golden rule, which is that one should speak about one’s impure thoughts and never hide them. Of course, you need not trumpt them in public. But you should certainly tell some friend about them. And, indeed, you should be mentally prepared not to mind even if the whole world knew about them. Have faith in the words of Vinoba and do not yeild to despair.

  LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL JOSHIlibtech_26_footnote 
 June 17, 1932
 I, for one, daily realize this truth from experience, that Nature provides for the needs of every living creature from moment to moment, and I also see that, voluntarily or involuntarily, knowingly or unknowingly, we violate this great law every moment  of our lives. All of us can see that, in consequence of our doing so, on the one hand large numbers suffer through over-indulgence and, on the other, countless people suffer through want. Our endeavour, therefore is to save mankind from the calamity of widespread starvation on the one hand and, on the other, destruction of food-grains by the American millionaires though a false understanding of economic laws. It is true, of course, that it is impossible at present to live in perfect conformity with this natural law. But that need not worry us.

Hingorani     A LETTERlibtech_27_footnote   June 	17, 1932  	Nothing as regards the conduct of prisoners can be sent from here 	for publication. As you say clarification on this point is desirable 	but that must await a suitable opportunity. I appreciate your 	argument against fetters. However I still think that the distinction 	between ordinary and political prisoners is invalid. There is need 	for reform in    
 the administration of prisons. A prison should be a  house  of correction and not punishment. If that is so, why should a forger have fetters on his legs in prison? The fetters will not improve his character. To my mind it is intolerable that anyone should be fettered if there is no likelihood of his trying to escape or becoming unmanageable or wishing to make a nuisance of himself. But if a political prisoner is an athlete like you, always thinkinig out means of escape and unable to control his tongue and hands, it will be the duty of the authorities to put him in fetters. In short what I mean is that the discrimination between political and other prisoners is not justified. We reformers should not seek for any concessions which cannot be justified on ethical grounds and are not granted to all prisoners in the same category. I should be unbale to stand an arrangement by which wheat  is given to politicals and maize to ordinary prisoners. Wheat bread must be issued to a prisoner who is unable to digest maize even if he is a murderer. And a political prisoner who has splendid digestion must give up wheat and ask for maize, and thus protect his fellow-prisoners. But these are only my views upon which I must not insist from where I am. Let each follow the dictates of his own conscience.

 had referred to the climate in the expectation that we should try to get him transferred from Gorakhpur. The Sardar suggested that he should certainly be transferred to some place with a better climate. Bapu said, ‘Yes, but we must apply for the transfer ourselves, if we want it, and I have no mind to do so. Harilal was in the worst prison  in South Africa, but his transfer was arranged by him himself and not by me’. The Sardar said, ‘But we are not prisoners here. The circumstances in India are different. Let us apply by means.’ Bapu yielded after all and wired to Hailey. ”

         CHI. 	MANILAL,   LETTER TO MANILAL GANDHI     June 	18, 1932 
  	I got your letter sent with Medhlibtech_35_footnote. I don’t think I shall be able to see him. In the 	first place, as Mirabehn is not permitted to see me I have stopped 	seeing any visitors. And, secondly, the name of every intending 	visitors has to be sent to the Government and Medh’s name is not 	likely to be approved. Even if he is permitted to see me, I don’t 	think we would be allowed to discuss the affairs of South Africa. In 	the letter asking for the permission, he should state as the reason 	his intention to discuss them. If I see him then, there would be no 	need to send a cable to you. But I did not have even a letter from 	Medh. He can at any rate write to me.  	So you were all attacked by the virulent fever. In the absence of 	any news by cable, I assume that all of you are well. I approved of 	Sushila’s and Sita’s staying on there because I thought they 	were certain to keep better health there. And so it seems God sent 	me this message through your illness: ‘You are a fool. Who are you 	to think who would keep better health where? I keep people healthy 	or make them ill as I choose. Why don’t you understand this simple 	thing?’ Though I have now learnt this wisdom, I still think that 	it might be better for them to remain in South Africa. But now it 	seems that you, too, will have to remain there. I also think that, 	if Pragji is not ready to shoulder the responsibility or if the 	responsibility is beyond his capacity and if you cannot make any 	other arrangement, you cannot come. It would not be proper to close 	the paper at this time. The problems here will take care of 	themselves. Stay there without worrying about things here, and don’t 	feel unhappy that you cannot come. After all, you live there for 	public service and not for your own    
 happiness. Write to me regularly.
 All there of us are very well. We do plenty of spinning, of course. I now rotate the wheel with my foot and draw the thread with the right hand. Even otherwise, I wished to experiment on this spinning-wheel for the sake of Prabhudas. But now I have an additional reason for spinning on it, namely, that my left elbow needs rest. Mahadev spins yarn of 40 counts. Sardar makes envelopes from useless paper. It is in one such envelope that I intend to seal this letter.
 Ramdas is in this jail. He sees me sometimes. His health is all right. He is reading and studying at present. Nimu and the children are in the Ashram.
 Devdas is far away in Gorakhpur. He has been having fever for some days. But there is no cause for anxiety. The fever is now receding.
 Ba is in Sabarmati [jail] and Kantilibtech_36_footnotelibtech_37_footnotein Visapur [jail]. There are many others, too, in jail, but I need not mention them here. Did I tell you that Devdas is engaged to Rajaji’s daughterlibtech_38_footnotelibtech_39_footnote? The engagement was the result of the strong desire of them both. Because of the struggle, they have put off the marriage.
 A good many reforms are being introduced in the Ashram. By reforms I mean further measures of self-control.
 Personally, I never think as to when the struggle would end. Let it end when it will. For him who fights for Truth and with truthful means, victory and defeat are the same. That is, he always wins, though the victory may come now or in future.
Sardar and Mahadev send their blesseings.

  LETTER TO ASHRAM BOYS AND GIRLS 
 June 18, 1932
 DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS,
 God never does evil, for He is Truth. Hence man himself is responsible for the evil that he does. Whatever good we do is inspired by Him, and, therefore, it may be said that He does it.
 As for the degree of proficiency in Sanskrit, you should know the language well enough to be able to understand the Gita. This includes grammar.
 If you find that the work has increased so much that you do not get even half an hour every day completely free, you should reduce the period of study. Don’t think that you will learn less to that extent. By taking half an hour’s rest, you will in crease your capacity for grasping to that extent and so on balance there will be nothing but gain. Scientists have proved this by experiments.
 Besides books on religion, there are plenty of books on other subjects in the Ashram which you can read. Everybody may select from them and read the books which he likes. The books are not only in Gujarati, but also in Urdu, Hindi, even in Sanskrit, and of course in English.
 I assume that the new office-bearers elected will do their duty properly.
 I observe that boys and girls are careless in using paper. That should not be. And they should never tear out sheets from exercise books and write on them.

  LETTER TO MATHURADAS TRIKUMJI 
 June 18, 1932
 I got your lettter. I think it would be better not to write about the Lothian reportlibtech_42_footnote, though I see nothing wrong in principle in doing that. Personally, I would not even wish to write about it. I would always feel that I didn’t have sufficient data for the purpose. Why, then, waste mental energy and also time in trying to write about it?
 Devdas has taken ill. The fever is receding now and there is no cause for anxiety. Manilal, Sushila, Sita, Pragji and his daughter, all of them had caught virulent fever in Natal, but the latest news about them was reassuring.
 I had never thought that you would write a playlibtech_43_footnotelibtech_44_footnote. Your thoughts are turning toward ultra-modern reforms. I do believe that within certain limits divorce should be permitted, but I would not at all care to propagate that idea. Generally we are such slaves of the psycholo- gical forces in us that no one will wager that his mind will be in the same state tomorrow in which it is today. I, therefore, feel even now that a marriage tie voluntarily entered into ought not to be broken without a very strong reason. If I had divorced Ba on the difference over untouchability, surely we would never have known the beautiful relation between us which exists today. Who can say in what condition Ba would be living and with whom I would have  rushed  into marriage? But the idea that there can be no divorce was ingrainedin us, and so the crisis passed and only its memory is left now. I hope, therefore, that you have not advocated in your play unfettered freedom for a husband or a wife to divorce either party at will.
 If it were man’s duty to gratify his carnal passion, I would certainly understand the necessity of artificial means of birth control.libtech_45_footnoteIf, however, we regard gratification of passion without a desire for progeny as sin—and according to me it should be so regarded—it would be putting a premium on sin to prevent progeny by artificial means. It is Nature’s eternal law that one shall reap as one sows. If man idulges his carnal passion, let him bear the burden of progeny. The question why the woman should bear it does not arise, since we regard her as completely free. The adoption of artificial means of birth-control in the West is already producing one result, namely, that the sanctity of marriage is disappearing and men and women gratify their lust without any restraint. It is not many years since these means came into vogue, and yet the bond which had been held as sacred all this time is losing its strength. Advanced thinkers in the West now look upon marriage as a superstition and see nothing evil even in a brother and a sister feeling passion for each other and gratifying it, but, on the contrary, regard it as completely normal. I don’t look upon these views as the swinging of the pendulum to the other extreme. I think that they are the direct and natural result of the same attitude of mind which lies at the back of artificial birth-control. It is possible that the bonds of marriage, etc., which we now regard as spiritually uplifting may actually be spiritually degrading. But I simply cannot go beyond conceding such a possibility for the sake of argument. All such talk in the name of ethics and science seems extremely dangerous to me. These new ideas are raining from the fountain of false compassion and impatience and of the thinkers’ experiences limited to the hour of pleasure. I wish that we do not get drenched by this rain. Moreover, having regard also to the conditions in Îndia we have no use whatever, for these artificial methods. Millions are ruined in health and have become weak in minds. If they start gratifying their passion as soon as it is aroused, there would be an end to all possibility of our progress. Some of the men who have been using these means are almost impotent. Cast a glance at the advertisements which appear in newspapers. I am writing all this from wide observation. I wrote the articles in Nitinashane Margelibtech_46_footnotelibtech_47_footnotein reply to letters received every week from enfeebled students and teachers. The youth of India need justnow to learn the lesson of self-control, however painfully it may
 
 be. The condition of girls, too, is most extraordinary. How strange that a girl like . . .libtech_48_footnotelibtech_49_footnote, brought up in the Ashram, only fifteen years old and weak in body, should express a desire to get married? How is it that a girl of her age feels passion? But the whole atmosphere in our society is unclean. From their very childhood boys and girls are fed  on impure suggestions. I would never consent to teach such boys and girls that it was right and proper to yield to passion. But I will not dwell further on this subject. You will understand my views from what I have said.
 Pyarelal is in Dhulia [jail] and Devdas in Gorakhpur [jail]. In the Dhulia jail, one may say that they have formed a society for the study of the Gita, for Vinoba daily discourses on the work.
 Since your health is good otherwise, I am not at all concerned at your having lost 17 Ib. Weight is a factor in judging the state of one’s health only within certain limits. Jamnalalji has lost 25 lb. There is of course a difference between his condition and yours. You cannot afford to lose weight as liberally as he can.
 I hear from time to time from Taramati and Diliplibtech_50_footnote. I had asked them to come and see me. They were about to come, when I suddenly stopped seeing visitors. If the gates open again, I will repeat the invitation.
 The Times weekly gives every month a map of the stars visible in the sky at the time. All of you should have look at it. I myself have been watching the stars every night and enjoy the experience immensely. I have woken up in old age. But what harm can there be in waking up even on death-bed if watching the stars helps one to have a glimpse of the soul? My blessings to all who may see you.

          CHI. 	SHARDA   LETTER TO SHARDA C. SHAH     June 	18, 1932 
  	It is bad thing to commit a mistake. That is why we should be 	ashamed of it. But having committed it, it is a good thing to ask to 	be forgiven. Hence what is there to be ashamed of in asking to be 	forgiven? It implies a determination not to repeat the mistake. Once 	this determination is there, why should one be ashamed? Have you 	understood this?  	Why should truth and non-violence be compared? But, if one must make 	the comparison, I would say that truth is superior even to 	non-violence; for, falsehood too is violence. And he who loves truth 	is bound to turn to non-violence some day.

         DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER TO DR. HIRALAL SHARMA   June 	18, 1932 
  	Shrimati Behn Amtussalaam sent me some time ago your pamphlets and 	the two volumes of your book, Light and Colour in 	the Medical World. I am grateful for your having 	treated Amtulbehn with extreme care and attention which she tells me 	you gave her. As for the literature on Light and Colour I can 	express no opinion, as I have no experience, worth the name, of this 	treatment.  	As I have not much faith in drugs and as I believe in the great 	healing power of the sun, naturally I would love to find that the 	methods you are advocating are sound and can bear investigation. If 	under the restrictions in which I am living I can  make any 	experiments, I shall do so.  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI [From 	Hindi]  Bapuki 	Chhayamen Mere Jivanke Solah Varsh, 	p. 8 
  PRAYERlibtech_51_footnote 
 June 19, 1932
 Prayer is the very foundation of the Ashram. We should, therefore, clearly understand what it means. If it is not offered from the heart, it is no prayer at all. We rarely see anybody dozing while eating. Paryer is a million times more important than food. If anybody dozes at prayer time, his condition must be pitiable indeed. If we miss the prayer, we should feel deeply pained. We should not mind if we miss a meal, but we should never miss a prayer. Missing a meal is sometimes beneficial for health. Omitting prayer never is.
 If any person dozes at the time of prayer, feels lazy or talks with his neighbours while the prayer is going on, does not fix his attention on it and lets his thoughts wander, he has as good as absented himself from it. His physical presence is mere show. he is, therefore doubly guilty; he has absented himself from the prayer and has deceived the people. To deceive means to act untruthfully, and, therefore, to violate the vow of truth.
 If, however, anybody feels sleepy or bored against his will, what should he do? But this can never happen. If we run straight from the bed to the prayer meeting, we are bound to feel sleepy. Before going to the meeting, we should rouse ourselves fully and brush our teeth, and resolve to remain awake and alert. In the meeting we should not sit close to one another, should sit erect like a walking stick, breathe slowly and, if we can speak the words correctly, join in reciting the verses or singing the bhajans, silently to ourselves if not loudly. If we can not do even this, we may go on repeating Ramanama. If we still cannot control our body, we should keep standing. No one, whether a grown-up person or a child, should feel shame in doing so. Grown-up persons should occasionally keep standing, even if they do not feel sleepy, in order to create an atmosphere in which nobody would feel ashamed of standing.
 Everyone should make an effort and understand as soon as possible the meaning of what is recited or sung for prayer. Even if a person does not know Sanskrit, he should learn the meaning of each verse and meditate over it.

       the 	following item. 
  
         CHI. 	NARANDAS,   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI   June 	16/19, 1932 
  	I got your packet on Tuesday.   Read  my  replylibtech_52_footnoteto  Jethalal’s letter. I have not received his 	report. Send it by registered post. You have sent Hiralal Shastri’slibtech_53_footnoteaccount of his “Jivankutir”, but it is not 	accompanied by any letter from him not do you mention anything in 	your letter. If you know, please tell me something about him. I have 	already written to you about Sitala Sahay. I hope you also got the 	postcard I wrote about Mahavir.  	I send with this a letter for Medh. Manilal’s problem  has  become 	very complicated. I think we should now give up the hope of his 	coming.  	About prayers, I intend to write a separate article, so that it may 	be useful to all. I, therefore, do not write anything about it in 	this letter. It will be enough if you are able to keep up the new 	rulelibtech_54_footnotewhich 	has been adopted.  	The labourers should wear khadi, send their children, if they have 	any, to the Ashram school, give up smoking, but only if they can 	easily do so, should be free from the vice of drinking and, if they 	are staying on the Ashram premises, attend the morning or the 	evening prayer. It should not be enough if they wear khadi when in  	the Ashram but not outside. If they like spinning, they may spin,  	otherwise they need not. I think we should not lay down any other 	condition besides these. However, we should have faith that if we 	take interest in their lives, share their joys and sorrows, and care 	for their children, they will observe the other rules voluntarily  	and  in  the proper spirit. Just now, we should only explain to them 	the meaning and importance of those rules. If our company really has 	the power ofimproving them, Tulsidas’s assurancelibtech_55_footnotelibtech_56_footnotewill 	not be proved false. We shall be tested, too. Up to now we have not 	looked upon labourers as our kith and kin. It is true that we have 	tried to be friendly with them,        (Ramacharitamanasa—Balkanda) 
 but we have done so patronizingly. There has always been a feeling in us that we are in some way superior to them. The more I understand the truth, the more I realize at nobody is superior or inferior to others. And we cannot judge, we have no means at all of judging, who has more holy merit earned in past lives. Who can say  whether  the mustard seed or the mountain is superior? We don’t regard a thing as superior or inferior because of its size. Similarly, we cannot compare the relative worth of persons. I have, therefore, suggested the easiest rule—I should say, rather, that I have extracted it from Shastras—that everybody should regard himself as a cipher. We shall then never feel proud about ourselves. If you or anybody else, who has more practical experience of life than I, see any error in this reasoning of mine regarding labourers, please point it out to me. It will of course be difficult to act upon it. But there must be some difficulty in every attempt to do a good thing.
 I feel that Dhiru and Kusum have returned much too quickly. There must be some reason why they did so. If you have been able to know it, tell me what it is. I had Dhiru’s letter from Ranavav last week, in which he had said that both of them kept good health and that their weight was improving. Hence I infer that they have returned so soon because something must have happened there which hurt them. I have already explained to you my reason for not writing “Blessings from” when signing the letters—it saves energy. My blessings must be assumed.
 I think that Ba’s reply that the illness was caused by mangoes is not correct. Her attitude is that one should not eat mangoes at a difficult time like this, and she is right from her own point of view. She wishes in the depth of her heart that I also should feel in the same way, and the reason is her love for me. She has seen the fruit of the little self-control which I have exercised. In the past it used to trouble her and she could not even understand its aim, but gradually she realized its value. However, this time I have not excluded mangoes from my diet. Fresh fruit is essential in the diet experiment which I am making. I have always found that mangoes benefit me. Hence, when some mangoes were sent to me unasked, I did not object to eating them. The fact that I had no objection to eating mangoes become known and so parcels have been coming one after another. However, I don’t criticize Ba’s resolution not to eat mangoes.
If you begin mixing with the Chharas, do not give up the
 practice afterwards. If, however, you discover that the task is beyond your strength, you may give up the attempt. None the less I do believe that it is our duty to mix with them even at some sacrifice to ourselves. We should not try to mix with them in the hope that thereby we shall save ourselves from possible harassment by them. If we entertain any such hope, we shall not save ourselves. God will save us, if He wills. If He does not, we will welcome the harassment as His loving gift. We should regard it as our duty to mix with them because they are our neighbours. According to me, the person most qualified to make the attempt is panditjilibtech_57_footnoteThe first time we go in their midst, we should go singing Ramdhun. But it is necessary that Panditji should have faith in himself for this purpose. He can also take with him a party of children who will lead the procession. We can take up the job of teaching the Chhara children. We can help the Chharas who may fall ill. If we take up that work, one person should devote himself exclusively to it. We can help them in two ways in illness. In ordinary cases, we ourselves may treat the patients. If a case is beyond our skill, we may ask for help from doctors with whom the Ashram has connections, and I think they will be glad to give it.
 Tell Chhakkaddas that I was so pleased with the slivers sent by him that I would not mind having more. I do not get here slivers of such fine cotton. If, therefore, he would like to send more, as he said he would, he may. I will not use them, for I don’t think I can spin yarn of 40 counts on the Magan spinning-wheel. I have not heard of anybody else either, who could do so. And slivers like those are too good for yarn of lower count. Mahadev requires at most 30 tolas of slivers every month, and there is no immediate need. he has enough slivers from the lot sent by Chhakkaddas to last for thirty days. After it is finished, Mahadev will surely try to spin with the slivers prepared here and see what count he can produce with them. I have stated all this only in order that Chhakkaddas may not think it necessary to work very hard and send the slivers immediately. And he may send them only if he can do so without any inconvenience. Chimanlal andyou should consider independently whether Chhakkaddas should be put to all this trouble, and, if you think that he had made the offer merely through his goodness and that really it would be much trouble to him to send the slivers, do not convey my message to him. I send
 
 with  this  Totaramji’s  letter.  Bhansalilibtech_58_footnotelibtech_59_footnoteis  really  very   strong   in   his firmness. Where is Lilabehnlibtech_60_footnotelibtech_61_footnote, and what does she do? Has she kept up any connection with the Ashram? I did not get any letter from Ramnarayan Choudharilibtech_62_footnotelibtech_63_footnote.  And now that the Ashram has been shifted to Wardha, he may even have courted arrest. if you have  heard anything more about the matter, please let me know.
 Where is Laljilibtech_64_footnoteworking at present? Is there no yarn in Vijapur or Amreli? Does any person on behalf of the Government stay in the Vidyapith? And does he use the buildings for any purpose? I hope Kanaiyalal has now completely recovered. You must have come to know that Damodardas is in serious difficulties.
 I got your second letter while I was writing this. I had got a direct wire, too, about Devdas. I have sent a wire in return asking for more details. I have not received any reply to it so far.

           MY 	DEAR LAURI,   LETTER TO LAURI SAWYERlibtech_65_footnote      June 	19, 1932 
  	Prof. Horace Alexander reminds me of your existence and tells me how 	weak you are. Of course I remember you perfectly. Weak in body you 	may be, but the very first time I met you I saw how strongyou were 	in will. And if God wants more service from you in your present 	existence, He will give you sufficient strength of body. For those 	who have faith in God, life and death are alike. Ours is to        
 serve till the last breath. Do write to me when you can. Love from Mahadeo.
     PS.  Yours,  BAPU   I write 	nothing about ourselves as you must know all there is to 
  	know.  Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, Vol. I, p. 232     LETTER TO JETHALAL G. SAMPATlibtech_66_footnote   June 	19, 1932  	I consider yours to be a scientific experiment, and therefore I have 	been watching you all along and have desired to follow your work in 	full detail. You are a seasoned worker and will encounter many more 	difficulties in the future. This is the usual pattern of every great 	work: once in a while we feel that the line is now clear and we 	shall be able to make rapid progress. We then relax a little, but 	all at once we notice a deep ditch in front of us. Therefore you 	must settle there permanently. The one thing needful is infinite 	patience with self confidence at the root of it. Self-confidence 	means an unflinching faith in one’s work. Once this faith is 	acquired, there is no need to be anxious about the numerous errors 	we are unconsciously bound to commit from time to time. We must not 	permit ourselves to be paralysed by the fear that we are perhaps on 	the wrong  path.  I consider your experiment to be scientific, yet I 	think it is not perfectly scientific now; but your work shares in 	all the characteristics of a scientific experiment, and you have the 	patience needed in carrying it out. I had noticed one defect in you 	before, but I think you have remedied it intelligently. Or perhaps 	your devotion to truth has helped you to remedy it without being 	conscious of it. That defect was this: you were satisfied with 	incomplete data and drew hasty conclusions from them. But this is no 	longer the case. A scientific experimenter has profound confidence 	in himself and is therefore never down- hearted. At the same time he 	is so humble that he is never satisfied with his own work, and is 	not guilty of drawing hasty conclusions. On the other hand he 	measures his progress off and on and declares emphatically that the 	result of ‘x’ can be ‘y’ only. Our workers are    
 generally lacking in this humility of the real man of science. I was therefore not surprised when I found that you were not an exception to this rule. But I do belive that you have the power of persevering till the end. Ardently wishing that you may not suffer even from this little limitation, I gently drew your attention to it many years ago. In order to succeed you must first collect a band of fellow-workers around you. They are bound to be gradually attracted to you in view of the work you are doing. In order to attract them you must cultivate the quality of tolerance springing from generosity. Co-workers cannot do everything that we are doing or we want them to do. But if they are well-intentioned and diligent, we should not despise their assistance. Only thus can we hope to build up a team. In the absence of such an accommodating Spirit some of us have to plough a lonely furrow.
 One thing more about your work. You should cultivate a desire to take tips even from those who are working on other lines. It is a mistake to suppose that a scientific experiment can be performed in one particular manner, and those who fall into such error stand to lose a good deal. We for ourselves may follow a method which we think to be right or perfect, but if others do not recognize its perfection or notice defects in it, we should let them go their own way. We thus increase our power of comprehension.
 I cannot say anything about your present method of work. As I am partial to you, it seems to be all right from here. But if I am able to see you actually at work, it is possible that many ideas would occur to me and I would place them before you for consideration. I cannot picture your work accurately from this distance. It would therefore be an impertinence to offer any suggestions.

 BHAI NANABHAI,
 I have your letter. I got as much of Manilal’s letter as you have copied out and sent to me. If there is anything in the est of the letter which may interest me, please make a copy and send it to me.
 I also feel that, since Pragji refuses to shoulder the  respon- sibility of Indian Opinion, Manilal should stay on [in South Africa]. He should not abandon it as long as he has confidence that he can run it. His first duty is to that paper. After all, we wish to do public service, no matter where. We should be satisfied if all of them are happy in South Africa. The fever which spread in Natal was of a deadly character. They have survived the present attack at any rate. I was happy at the news that Sushila and Sita were staying behind, thinking that they were bound to keep better health there. But does anybody know what he should rejoice at and what weep for? We should stop doing either.
 Give my condolences to Dadasaheb Mahajani’s family. Sardar and Mahadev send their regards.

  LETTER TO HANUMANPRASAD PODDAR 
 June 21, 1932
 In answering question on spiritual matters it is an advantage to keep in mind the particular inquirerlibtech_79_footnotelibtech_80_footnote. To write for newspapers is a difficult task for me. My mind has turned almost blank upon learning that you have asked the questions with a view to publish them in Kalyan. It does not mean that the public gains nothing from what I write for the papers. I am simply explaining my own point of view. That is why I have reiterated many a time in Young India that it was not a journal for me but a weekly letter meant for friends. And the spiritual matters discussed in Young India and Navajivan have been almost invariably written with a certain individual in view. It has areason behind it. I am not well-versed in the Shastras. Although I make use of reasoning often enough the mainspring of my talks and writings is not the intellect but the heart. And the outpourings of the heart cannot be presented in the form of an essay . . . .
 Finding no alternative expression I had used “Disciplined faith”.libtech_81_footnoteBut is   does not express all I mean and at present no other expression occurs to my mind. What is meant is that faith should not be ignorant, devoid of discrimination and blind. For example in a matter where reasoning too applies someone asserts, “I take resort to faith and shall persist in doing so no matter what  the  reason indicates.” There is no discipline in this kind of faith. To determine whether the earth is round or flat is a matter of intellect. Despite this someone may say that his faith suggests the earth to be flat. This is not disciplined faith.

  A LETTERlibtech_82_footnote 
 June 21, 1932
 A craving for things of beauty is perfectly natural. Only there is no absolute standard of beauty. I have therefore come to think that the craving is not to be satisfied, but that from the craving for things outside of us, we must learn to see beauty from within. And when we do that, a whole vista of beauty is opened out to us and the love appropriation vanishes. I have expressed myself clumsily, but I hope you follow what I mean. . .
 The purpose of life is undoubtedly to know oneself. We cannot do it unless we learn to identify ourselves with all that lives. The sum total of that life is God. Hence the necessity of realizing God living within every one of us. The instrument of this knowledge is boundless selfless service.

  LETTER TO RAMESHWARDAS PODDAR 
 June 21, 1932
 CHI. RAMESHWARDAS,
 I forgot to send a reply to your letter with this week’s post. Do not yield to your ignorant love and every harm the good of Shriram. Go to Kashi or Kangri from time to time and see him. What other freedom will Vinoba permit you? Remember to what distant places Kamalnayan wanders one after another. Parents have no  right whatever to harm the interests of their children. If you have heard more about Shivaji, Dattu, Shankarrao and others, let me know. The distinction that is made between a diet of cereals and pulses and a fruit diet has no value. From both physical and spiritual points of view, some of the cereals and pulses may be more wholesome than fruit in certrain circumstances. Ground-nut, though it is classed as a fruit, is harmful in almost every disease, whereas rice, though a cereal, can always be eaten in a limited quantity. Anybody who wishes to control his senses may keep himself alive on rice, but groundnut is likely to
 
 be harmful to him. You may be sure that, for your health  pendaslibtech_83_footnotelibtech_84_footnotewill be extremely harmful. Instead of eating a full meal in the evening consisting of rice, dal, rotlis and vegetables, if you take a little fruit, such as  munakkaslibtech_85_footnotelibtech_86_footnote, oranges, pomegranates or any other juicy fruit, that will certainly be much lighter. Considered as foods, however,  there is no diffrence between cereals and fruit. The distinction between them seems to have been invented by Vaishnavaslibtech_87_footnotelibtech_88_footnotewho could not conquer the palate and wished to deceive themselves and God. Having been born in a Vaishnava family myself, I am writing this from experience. Just as we make a poultice of linseed or wheat flour, in the same manner earth should be moistened and wrapped in a piece of cloth in the form of a bandage, which should then be bound round the abdomen. This should always be done on an empty stomach. Binding the pack in this manner when the stomach is  full  does harmand causes stomachache. Meditating on the Gita  means meditating on the meaning of any verse or phrase from it.

     LETTER TO BEHRAMJI KHAMBHATTA   June 	21, 1932  BHAISHRI 	KHAMBHATTA,  	I got your letter. I had obtained permission for both of you to come 	and see me and was about to write to you, when an order was issued 	barring Mirabehn from seeing me. I thought it my duty not to see 	other visitors if I could not see her, and so I stopped the 	interviews.   I am   still  trying to get the order barring Mirabehn 	withdrawn. Hence I did not write to you immediately. I assumed that 	you must have heard about the order against her. I think you know 	that last time I had stopped seeing visitors our account of the 	Naoroji sisters, and so I thought you would draw the necessary 	inference. I had obtained permission for you to see me not in your 	capacity as a bone-setter but as a friend. Of course, if you had 	come you would have examined my elbow, and if you had then thought 	daily massaging of the arm necessary I would have had to obtain 	special permission for that. How could I make it a principle not to 	let you do such service to me? I    
 would certainly be happy if your touching my arm could cure the pain. But it is true that I would prefer, though not as a matter of principle, to leave the responsibility of calling in a doctor from outside to the Government. But such a necessity has not arisen in this case. The condition of the arm has not become hopelessly bad. Mahadev does message the arm as well as he can with the help of your book. Major Mehta has joined here as a doctor on special duty. He is trying electric shocks. If these measures have no  effect  and  the doctors here confess their failure, the question of calling in help from outside will naturally arise and then you will be able to come in your capacity as a bone-setter even though I may not be seeing any visitors. I have always fully understood your love for me and, therefore, will not feel the slightest hesitation in accepting any service from you. I would even request it if I need it. At which place is the hymn. “Lead, Kindly Light”, to be sung? Or will you two sing it every Friday in your home? If you sing it in your home and if no English friends arepresent, I suppose you know that the Ashram Bhajanavali contains a Gujarati translationlibtech_89_footnotelibtech_90_footnoteof the hymn in case you wish to use it. You may sing it if you like it. Here we sing that. Is Father Elwin with you at present or is he still in the Ashram? You had mentioned a special oil for the message. If, apart from the massage, the oil itself has an effect, send a little of it. I hope both of you are well. Are three of us are quite happy.
 Blessings to you both from

         CHI. 	MIRA,   LETTER TO MIRABEHN      June 	22, 1932 
 Your 	letter came in yesterday.  	I am defeated. I have taken milk and baker’s bread  and therefore 	salt also. Major Bhandari will not let me make experiments that 	might endanger health. And he thought it was time for me to take 	milk and bread, also fruit. He is of opinion that absence of salt 	must    
 reduce weight and that I cannot afford to lose. I succumbed. The saltless experiment I must reserve for future day. I am none the worse for the brief experiment, if I am not better. I have made certain observations. But they are of no value as they are based on much too short-lived an experiment. You will tell me of your experiment, if you have made further discoveries.
 Your   previous   letterlibtech_91_footnotelibtech_92_footnoteI   have   sent   to   the   Government   in confirmation of my letterlibtech_93_footnotelibtech_94_footnote.  Let us see what happens.
 You asked what the electrical treatment was. It is called high frequency—it consists in rubbing with a flat glass bulb charged with violet rays. Exposure to the early morning sun should serve the same purpose except [for] this [that the] instrumental rays are hot.
 Then you asked about the Ashram history. I am trying to deal with every phase of the Ashram activities. But the work is proceedingvery slowly. Somehow or other I do not give it some time every day. And as yet, I have not felt like giving it resolutely one hour daily. However, if I am here long enough, the history will, God willing, be certainly finished.
 Damodardas has written. He seems to have been hurt by that last conversation you had under his roof. I have asked him to talk to you about it. But you will yourself ask him what hurt him. I know you could have no intention of hurting him. I have begged of him to give up speculation altogether and be satisfied with a humble life. Davdas has enteric though of a mild type. You should write to him. His address is District Jail, Gorakhpur, U.P.
 I do not suppose you have noticed that “The valiant only taste of death but once” has a deeper meaning conveying the perfect truth according to the Hindu conception of salvation.libtech_95_footnoteIt means freedom from the wheel of birth and death. If the world‘valiant’ may be taken to mean those who are strong in their search after God, they die but once, for they need not be reborn and put on the mortal coil.
 The weather here at this time of the year is always cool. We, too, had showers.
 
 My congratulations to Shantabai on her taking up the wheel again.
 I am glad you are mothering Tilaklibtech_96_footnote. He   needs  it.  Of  course Noorbhanulibtech_97_footnoteis very good to him, But he does not speak enough Hindi to be able to talk to her to his heart’s content. And Noorbanu cannot give him what you can. Of course you will try to see her and Pyare Ali.
 Yes, I wrote to Narandas suggesting five minutes’ silence. I forgot to write to you about it. I am not doing it here. It  is unnecessary here and for you it is impracticable. The rapid repetition of Ramanama in a new assembly is undoubtedly good. For very rapid repetition, mere Ram, Ram, Ram Ram . . . is often used. If it is done with proper cadence, the effect is ecstatic. Yes, we get up at 3.40. The prayer at 4 and 7.30.
 My love to Nargis and Jal. I am glad the former has  so  improved. I do not remember the name Hilla Petit. I may have met her.
 I am glad Gulab and Manilal have seen you. Tell them to write to me. I do not need the ghee now.
 I hope you are not overworking yourself. Love from us all.

     LETTER TO HORACE G. ALEXANDER   June 	23, 1932  MY 	DEAR HORACE,  	I have your two letters. It was just like you to remind me about 	Lauri. I remember her quite well. She appealed to me at once as a 	beautiful character. And then it was Charlie who, I think, brought 	her to me. I wrote to her at once and sent my letterlibtech_105_footnotelibtech_106_footnoteby 	air mail. At least I asked the authorities to send it so and wrote 	it in time for the air mail.   I know that she is brave enough to 	face all the illnesses that may be in store for her and death.  	We are all three keeping well and quite fit. Mahadev and I pass the 	time spinning, reading, writing; Sardar in reading and envelope- 	making out of scraps of paper that come to us by chance. I call this 	healthy wealth-production in the name of and for the sake of all.  	I wanted to write to you earlier, but somehow or other it escaped 	me. You will be pleased to learn that at the Ashram the minute of       
 silence has been increased to five minutes. From the letters I was getting from the Ashram I saw that the concentrated labours of the inmates made them high-strung and therefore I felt that it was likely that those who were not used to such concentrated work might not be able to follow the prayer with required serenity. If therefore they had five minutes’ unbreakable silence to compose themeselves and put themeselves in tune with the Infinite, the prayer would  be  more fruitful. This was introduced now nearly a month ago or  a  little longer. And Narandas tells me that the silence has done much good.
 I have not yet got Charlie’s book. I expect it every week. We constantly think of you all at the Settlementlibtech_107_footnotelibtech_108_footnote. It was happy time you gave me at Selly Oak. Olivelibtech_109_footnotelibtech_110_footnoteis a great reminder to us all in faithful devotion and utter cheerfulness in spite of frail condition.

 other sweet things at Woodbrooke. We both wish her many more years of loving service.

  LETTER TO PARASRAM MEHROTRA 
 June 23, 1932
 CHI. PARASRAM,
 I had no fear or anxiety about Kamal’s illness. Children often get fever etc. If they do not fall into the clutches of  illinformed doctors and if the parents do not, through ignorant love,  go  on loading their stomachs with food, most of them recover without any medicine. Children have the vitality to recover from illness and regain strength sooner than grown-up people. You should ask those who used formely to attend the Ramayana classes but do not do so now, the reason why they do not attend them, not with a view to pressing them to attend but in order that, if they point out any defect in your manner of explaining, you may remove it. You may, if you wish, read Saketlibtech_111_footnotelibtech_112_footnoteto all who attend . But my suggestion was not that. It was that you should teach selected portions from the work to those
 who had made some advance in the study of Hindi, so that, when their interest was aroused in it, they might read the work by themselves and bring their difficulties to you.
 Anasakti certainly means freedom from attachment to anything concerning oneself and one’s relations, but also such deep attachment to the ‘other’, that is, to Truth, to God, so much so that one must lose oneself in Him, become one with Him. It is because we do not understand this that our enthusiasm wanes and other difficulties arise. You have used the word  nirutsahalibtech_113_footnotelibtech_114_footnoteas a noun. Mahadev immediately pointed out to me that it is an adjective. I told him that you  had used  it as a noun and that you were not likely to make such a mistake. But he told me that you had made a mistake. So we consulted a small Hindi dictionary which we have and found that it gives the word as an adjective. Solve this problem.

          CHI. 	PREMA,   LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK   June 	23, 1932 
  	Among the Urdu books, are there two volumes by Nadvi? He wrote 	something in continuation of Shibli’s work. Perhaps  the author’s 	name on the cover of the book will be Maulana Sulaiman Nadvi.  	About fish, I have not made an exception in your favour. Though 	cod-liver oil is forbidden for us, I have allowed it in the Ashram. 	Meat and fish are forbidden in the Ashram itself, but they are not 	forbidden to individuals, cannot be. I at any rate have never 	forbidden them to anyone. That is why Imam Saheb was permitted to 	eat them outside the Ashram. Suppose it was Narandas and not you. He 	was never touched meat, etc., in all his life. But suppose he fell 	seriously ill and his life was in danger, and he wished to save it 	by eating meat. I would certainly not prevent him from eating it. 	Today he knows my views and also what dharma teaches. But the 	approachof death may change one’s ideas. If at such a time, anyone 	wishes to eat meat, it would be my dharma not to prevent him from 	doing so. But suppose it is a child and I have to decide for it. I 	would let it die but not give it meat. Do you know that Ba once 	passed through such an ordeal? Most probably the incident is 	described in the Autobiography.libtech_115_footnotelibtech_116_footnoteIf 	you do not know about it, nor does anybody else, write to me and I 	will narrate it. It was a blessed occasion for both Ba and me. Do 	you now understand my meaning? I don’t wish to urge you to eat 	fish. If by not taking it you are likely to die and you are ready 	for that, I am ready to let you die. Even if eating fish enables you 	to live longer, will not the end be death? But, then, dharma is for 	one who has faith in it and is ready to follow it. Do I follow such 	dharma in my own life in regard to milk? I do not, though it is 	clear to me as daylight that one should not drink the milk of any 	animal. Such principles of dharma however are not meant to be 	enforced in the lives of others. One should follow them in one’s 	own life. I think I have said enough.  	Let me know what your present diet includes, with the quantity of 	each item. If I feel like suggesting a change, I will.  
 Your questions about men and women are good.
 We should explain to a child any matter about which it shows curiosity, if we know the answer. Otherwise, we should admit our ignorance. If we think the child’s question should not be answered, we should restrain it and also tell it not to ask others. In any case, we should never give an evasive reply. Children know more about these things than we think they do. If we refuse to tell them what they do not know, they learn to satisfy their curiosity in improper ways. We should, however, take that risk and not tell them what we think they ought not to be told. There are, of course, very few such things. If they want to know about the obscene act, we should certainly not satisfy their curiosity. Don’t mind if they learn the facts in a  clandestine manner despite our forbidding it.
 If children see birds engaged in the sex-act and want to understand what it means, I would certainly satisfy their curiosity and use the opportunity to teach them the lesson of brahmacharya. I would teach them the distinction between man on the one hand and birds and beasts on the other. All the men and women who act in thesame manner are, despite their human form, like birds and beasts in that particular respect. There is no condemnation of anyone in this; it is only a statement of fact. We have been granted the human form and our intelligence so that we may rise above our animal nature.
 All the facts about menstruation should be explained to a girl who has reached puberty; if a younger girl comes to know about the phenomenon and asks you about it, you may explain to her, too, as many facts as she can understand.
 Despite all our precautions, children will not always remain ignorant about these facts. Hence, it would be better to impart that knowledge to them at the proper time. If brahmacharya is so frail a thing that a person who know the facts about sex cannot observe it, we have no use for such brahmacharya. The knowledge of these facts should strengthen one’s brahmacharya. That is what happened in my case.
 The motives for seeking or imparting this knowledge  differ  from person to person. One person may seek it in order to gratify his lust. Another may learn the facts without his showing any curiosity about the subject. A third person may seek the knowledge in order to calm his passions and to help others.
One should impart this knowledge to others only if one is fit for
 the job. You should have that ability, and also the confidence that by imprating it to the girls you will not awaken sex-thoughts in them. You should remember all the time that you impart this knowledge to the girls in order that they may not be disturbed by such thoughts. If you yourself are not free from them you should take care that they do not disturb you while you are imparting this knowledge to the girls.
 The primany aim behind the partnership in life of man and woman as husband and wife is physical enjoyment. Hinduism has tried to teach in its place the practice of self control, or say, rather that all religions have done so.
 If the husband is Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar, so is the wife. A wife is not a servant; she is a friend with equal rights, a partner in dharma. Each is the guru of the other.
A daughter’s share should be equal to a son’s.
 A husband and a wife have equal rights in what either earns. The husband earns with the wife’s help, even if she does no more than cook for the family. She is not a servant, but is an equal partner.
 A wife has the right to live separately from her husband if he ill-treats her.
 The two have equal rights over the children. After the children have grown up, neither of them has any. If the wife is unfit to exercise her right, she loses it. And so does the husband.
 In sum, I do not admit any differences between men and women except those created by Nature which all of us can see. I don’t think now that I have left any of your questions on this subject unanswered.
 I have the fullest trust in Narandas. When he says that his mind is at peace, I would not believe that it is not so. I have cautioned him again and again. I will harass him no more from this distance. He has great capacity for working in a spirit of non-attachment.  Such a person always works much more than another who is attached to his work, and yet seems to be doing no work. He is the last person to tire. Realy speaking, he should never feel tired, but that is only an ideal. Since you are on the spot, your duty will be different from mine if you observe that his mind is not at peace and that he is deceiving himself. In that case you ought to caution him. I, too, would do that if  I were there and found that the evidence of my eyes contradicted what he said. If he disagrees with you and rejects your advice, you should accept what he says, so long as you believe that he is a truthful man. Very often our eyes, too, deceive us. If I think that you feel depressed but you contradict me, I must believe you. If I have reason to fear or
 suspect that you are trying to hide the fact from me, then it would be a different matter. In that case, I should not ask you. I would have to seek other means of discovering the truth. The Ashram life, however, connot go on thus. Truth is the very foundation of that life. There even with a good motive one cannot deceive others.
 You will read about khadi either in my letterlibtech_117_footnoteto Narandas or in the letter to children.
 Ask Narandas and know from him why he does not try an oil massage.
 By all means wait for 4th Julylibtech_118_footnote. But, then, 4th July of which year is a matter for speculation. It doesn’t matter which year, though. It is much even if only the month and the date are known for certain. We won’t have to wait, then, for some other month or date. After 4th July has passed, we shall wait in patience for the July of 1933."

  LETTER TO ASHRAM BOYS AND GIRLS 
 June 24, 1932
 DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS,
 All or most of you write to me on sheets taken out from exercise books. That is not right. It means waste of paper and slovenliness. You should use other writing paper.
 In permitting Premabehn to eat fish if she wants to do so, I have shown regard for non-violence. I have discussed this is my letterlibtech_120_footnotelibtech_121_footnoteto Premabehn. Read it. She will come to feel love for fish only if she can think independently. I have observed this in many persons with whom I came into contact. If you are not convinced even after reading this as well as my letter to Premabehn, you may ask me again.
 Those of you who still feel sleepy during prayer should stand up without feeling shy. Even if they do a few pranayamaslibtech_122_footnotesitting, the sleepiness would go. One cannot sleep while doing pranayama.
I have already told you that I cannot write anything from here

 I cherish the ideal of service for the Ashram children when they grow up.

God looks after the material and spiritual well- being of His bhaktaslibtech_125_footnotelibtech_126_footnote(the Gita, IX. 22, X. 10). You are making slow but steady progress in reading and writing.

A child may learn to read and write and still remain mentallydull. If you do not understand this fully, ask me to explain again. Do not feel dissatisfied even in your hearts with the present arrangement. Do this. Use your intelligence in doing  everything which you are asked to do. Even cleaning a lavatory requires great intelligence. If you do not know how, ask me.

  	You must know that what is true about the peacock is also true about 	uslibtech_128_footnote. Even men 	and women who have been beautiful are not a       
 pleasant sight after death, and we cremate them without delay. Hence, we should not be attached to bodies.
 There is no hartred in complaining about anyone’s lapses in discharging the duties laid down by one’s superior. But the person at fault should be tenderly warned.
 The expression  sahadharmacharinilibtech_129_footnotebasically does mean what you say. But in ordianary language it is used only for a wife.
 When a sister gets married , she does not stay with her brother. The expression charini has the implication of life-long adherence. And when a particular meaning comes to be attached to a word, it becomes difficulat to change it. Nor is it necessary. You are comfortable remaining alone. Look after your health.

  HOW TO OBSERVE AHIMSAlibtech_133_footnote 
 June 25, 1932
 Can we kill a snake? Can we use violence against a ruffian attempting to rape a woman? Can we plough a field, though knowing that we kill germs thereby? A votary of ahimsa need not concern himself with such problems. Let them solve themselves when they will. If we lose ourselves in this labyrinth, we shall forget ahimsa.
 Those who are sincere in their desire to follow ahimsa will examine their own hearts and look at their neighbours. If one finds ill will and hatred in one’s heart, one may know that one has not climbed the first step towards the goal of ahimsa. If a person does not observe ahimsa in his relations with his neighbours and his associates, he is thousands of miles away from ahimsa.
 A votary of ahimsa, therefore, should ask himself every day when retiring: “Did I speak harshly today to any co-worker? Did I give him inferior khadi for myself? Did I give him imperfectly baked roti and reserve for myself a fully baked one? Did I shirk my duty and throw the burden on my co-worker? Did I neglect serving the neighbour who was ill today? Did I refuse water to a thirsty passer-by who asked for it? Did I not care even to greet the guest who had arrived? Did I scold a labourer? Did I go on exacting work from him without thinking that he might be tired? Did I goad bullocks with spiked sticks? Did I get angry in the kitchen because the rice was half cooked?” All these are forms of intense violence. If  we  do  not observe ahimsa spontaneously in such daily acts, we shall never learn to observe it in other fields and, if at all we seem to observe it, our ahimsa will be of little or no value. Ahimsa is a great force which is active every moment of our lives. It is felt in our every action and thought. He who takes care of his pennies may rest assured that his
 pound is safe. But he who does not take care of pennies will lose them, and as for the pound he never had it.

  LETTER TO NATHURAM TRIKAMDAS

 BHAI NATHURAM,
 The  use  of  temples  and  choraslibtech_134_footnoteis  well  known.  The  people would assemble in these places, sing bhajans, hold meetings, etc., and that was the purpose which they were intended to serve.
 The question whether image-worship is necessary does not arise, since it has always existed and will continue to exist. Every human being is not an image-worshipper, of course.
 It may be desirable to make changes in the Vaishnava rituals of worship.
 God exists everywhere, and therefore, He exists in the image too.
I believe that destruction of image-worship is impossible.

  	One hundred and ninety-eight rounds in half an hour is great speed 	indeed. The sight must be worth watching.  	Anybody who aspires to do service must possess truthfulness, 	humility, single-minded devotion, etc., and observe brahmacharya. 	If the question, however is what things he must learn to do, it 	is one which is difficult to answer. One cannot know too many 	things. The only rule is that one must become totally absorbed in 	any duty that falls to one’s share, or that one should acquire 	proficiency in one’s chosen field of service. It is difficult to 	say more than this. If the question is, what type of work is the 	best form of service in the present condition of the country, it is 	easy to answer and I  have  often answered it in the past.

 BHAI LAKSHMINARAYANJI,
I was very glad to receive your letter.

 I hope that you both are in good spirits. Your love ever recurs to my mind.

 ning.      From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 5623       BAPU 
  
          CHI. 	NARANDAS,   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI   June 	22/26, 1932 
  	I got your packet. I examined the account sent by you. I think it is 	all right. Only, it does not include the information about the total 	number of hours given to each type of work. Do you wish to keep a 	record of that? The slips received from the inmates will of course 	contain the information. If you intend to paste them in a book, we 	shall be able to get any information we want and whenever we want 	it. If only one person enters all the information, I think he will 	take at least one hour. Though such an arrangement would make the 	work very easy, I do think that, if one person dictated and another 	took down, that would save time, even taking into account the time 	spent by both. But I can see even from the record of three days that 	the time spent in this work will not be wasted. If anybody has shown 	less than nine hours in his slip, it would be better if he also 	explains in it the reason. A slip will be a mine of information for 	us. Let this suffice for the present.  	This is what I feel about the Giri family: This responsibility has 	come to us unsought. Dalbahadurgiri’s sacrifice was very great. 	When he died, he asked Krishnamaiyadevi to go and live in the 	Ashram; so great was the trust that he put in us. Nobody else would  	have  supported her. The Congress there did nothing, or could do 	nothing. If I had begged from friends on her behalf, I would have 	got enough help. But I did not think it necessary. The affairs of 	the Ashram are planned on the assumption that every inmate who works 	for nine hours a day would earn his food and clothes. If, therefore, 	Krishna- maiyadevi lived in the Ashram, I calculated that it would 	not be nece- ssary to beg for help specially on her account. We 	regard it as our duty to support her only so long as she lives in 	the Ashram. After all these years, she expressed a desire to leave. 	Krishnamaiyadevi, Maha- vir, and Dharmakumar, all of them kept bad 	health. Maitri, too, was not very strong either. Krishnamaiyadevi. 	therefore, had sufficient reason for wishing to leave. In deciding 	whether or not we should pay the expenses of the family, it would be 	irrelevant and unfair to thinkof its many shortcomings. Persons who 	have nothing in them besides such shortcomings would not live in the 	Ashram or would not be able to do so even if they wished. We may 	give credit to the Ashram for tolerance for the fact that all those 	who lived in it could do so, but it 
 was no small degree of endurance on their part too. You will come across many who would prefer to starve rather than endure the severity of the Ashram life. But this family bore the difference of language, of the general mode of life and the absence of non- vegetarian food and endured living in what was to them a foreign land. I think we ought not to forget all this. That means that she was justified in leaving the Ashram. If so, we should pay them their expenses. In Darjeeling, if they maintain a separate establishment the expenditure would easily come to Rs. 15 per head. Since they live with her uncle, most probably the latter is saving something from the money given to them. If, however, she emphatically states that that is not so, I would certainly believe her. He must be incurring some expenditure because of them. I had asked her for accounts and for a description of their daily routine. As for the accounts, she said that since they were living with her uncle she simply paid him the amount at the rate of Rs. 15 per head. And it is understandable that, if they live with the uncle, they cannot keep a separate account of their expenses. Probably she keeps something for miscellaneous expenses, but I did not ask her about that. I had assumed that you received detailed letters from her. The last letter which I got from her a few days ago was after an interval of 20 to 25 days and that, too, was only for complaining that she had not received the money. I had asked her to send me a description of their daily routine, but so far I have not received it. Whether or not she keeps such a diary and sends it to me, just now we must pay the money. Their living in Darjeeling will also be a test for them. I don’t think they will want to stay there for more than two or three months. I have not fixed any limit in my mind. Personally, I desire that they should stay as long as they wish. I did ask her whether they would like to settle down in Darjeeling permanently. Mahavir was emphatic in his reply: “We belong to the Ashram and wish to live there. We have not come here with the intention of taking up an occupation. If you want us to go back, we would do so immediately. We wish to stay on here for some time longer only because we have come here after many years and because here our health has improved a little. I am however fully conscious of my responsibility. We will not do anything to tar the good name of the Ashram”. This was the substance of his reply. In future, if I get similar letters from him I will remember to send them to you. Maitri’s reply in regard to the question of her marriage was equally emphatic. “How can you ask me such a question just now? How can I think of
 marriage at a time like this? I have not the least desire to get married now, and, even when I wish later to get married, you will have to fix the marriage,”libtech_137_footnotelibtech_138_footnoteFinally, so long as we bear the expenditure of Rs. 100 for Radha, we must bear this expenditure of Rs. 90 too. We cannot here take into account the fact that Radha is the daughter of Maganlal, who was the very soul of the Ashram. if we pay attention to such considerations, we would sink deep into the well of discrimination between person and person. If at all we take that fact into account, it should be to expect Radha to bear more than others do. But I don't have the courage yet to ask Radha or Santok to do so. I believe that mother and daughter are doing what seems right to them and console my mind with that thought. If you see any error in this whole reasoning, please do point it out to me. I have explained the matter at such length in order that my attitude may be clear to you.
 Let  me  also   say   here   what  I   think   about   Dudhibehnlibtech_139_footnoteand Nimu. Dudhibehn probably runs her own kitchen. If so,  she  must be spending all the money she gets. Valji’s mode of life is extremely simple. Dudhibehn has lived in such atmosphere that she would not ask for any help even when she is ill. I would not, therefore, like to tell her anything. Nimu’s case, I admit, is in a different category, and you can even raise the matter with her. If you wish, I also may write to her. However, if I write from here that may give her pain. Ramdas makes repeated and sincere resolutions to live in a simple style. But he grew up in South Africa and always spent freely. After all, how simple can he make his life? Moreover, Nimu is but a child and she must also have spent freely when she lived under the parental roof. I am certain, therefore, that she makes the Ashram pay for some unnecessary expenses. Mahadev tells me that she takes her meals in the common kitchen. That only means that she eats food worth six or seven rupees—she probably pays for milk and curds from the sixty rupees which she gets. The food for the two children cannot be supplied from the kitchen. The expenditure for their milk and curds isprobably met from the sum of sixty rupees which is paid to her. If so, that sum may not be so shockingly large as I feel it is. However, that can be judged only by a person who knows how she spends the sum. You should get the information from her.
I left the letter incomplete with the last paragraph and busied
 
 myself with the meal. Meanwhile I got another letter from you, in which you have replied to my question regarding the hours of work for each type of work. Your explanation helps me  to  understand many things clearly. The word“Experiments” at the top probably refers to Keshu’s experiments. I observe that the largest number of hours is for the spinning yajna, and that seems very fitting. The fact shows that when a whole group of people do work, the maximum possible time will be devoted to it and yet it will not be a hardship to anyone. If, therefore, all people live in a spirit of yajna, the problems of life would disappear. I knew intuitively this value of public yajna, but I had never tested my belief with figures.
 Records are like the sixth finger. As things are, without that sixth finger everything would come to a standstill. But where everybody observes truth in thought, word and deed, there would be no necessity at all for a department of records, or, if, there was such a department,  it would require a minimum of time.
 In column 14, the entry is “ill” and in column 20 it is “nursing”. What does “ill” mean? With whom does Sharda  live now? That is, who is chiefly responsible for her support?
 It is certainly a fine thing that the spinning for yajna is done in the dehlalibtech_140_footnoteand it would be very good if the practice is kept up. I have no doubt that people will form many useful habits through this pract- ice. I am certainly glad that you are able to give two hours to this work, and I can also understand very well that it must be a time of rest for you. In the same way that prayer should give rest to a person, such yajna also should. Only those who feel it to be a burden will try to escape it or do it perfunctorily. I had only one consideration in mind in suggesting to you to limit your yajna work to only one hour. I thought that you had to do your other work under excessive pressure and might also not be getting enough time for sleep. If so, you should not look upon the yajna work as rest. But since you enjoy perfect peace and don’t feel the work to be a burden in any way, I have nothing to say about the matter.
 Bhau had suggested that, as they do in Wardha, at Sabarmati too we should use only the takli for spinning for yajna. I had replied to  him that I would write to you, but I forgot in my last letter. I am indifferent in this matter. I have not weighed the pros and cons of the suggestion. But you may listen to what Bhau has to say and do what seems best to you.
My arm is not bad, nor can I say that there is distinct improv-
 
 ement. I admitted defeat and started taking milk from today. I have written a detailed letterlibtech_141_footnotelibtech_142_footnoteto Mirabehn about this, which she will  get before you get this. It will of course be shown to you, and so I don’t repeat everything here. I remained on saltless diet for eleven days. I cannot say positively that the result was good, as is clear enough from the fact that I was forced to start taking milk. But I cannot say, either, that the absence of salt was responsible for the ill effects which follo- wed. I can guess many other causes. But I cannot make here, ought not to make, any experiment which has the slightest risk in it. If I try to take any such step, I would put the officials too in a difficult posi- tion. They would not desire to put any restraint on me in such a matter. Hence, If any ill consequence followed, they would be put in  a difficult situation. That is why I started taking milk from today, and have decided to eat bread from tomorrow. That means the experiment of saltless diet is over. But such diet has one effect, and, if anybody wishes to try it, the experiment is certainly worth making. I can state it as proved beyond doubt in my case that vegetables dressed without salt have a laxative effect. Saltless diet may, therefore, prove beneficial to anybody who suffers from constipation. When we were in South Africa, such diet was a rule. There should be no doubt, moreover, that saltless diet for a period is very useful for acquiring self-control. It is certain that Parnerkar’s aim has not been fulfilled. Has he calmed down a little now?
Did you post the letter to Savitribehn which I had sent to you?
 Mahadev had in fact opposed the suggestion that a Muslim bhajan should be recited on a fixed day. And now I have a letter from Chhaganlal, too, opposing it. Their argument is that Muslim bhajans are included in the Bhajanavali It should be enough if they are recited occasionally. To fix one bhajan to be recited on a fixed day does not seem right. I appreciate the argument But I still feel in the depth of my heart that there is much force in the suggestion to fix one day for a Muslim bhajan which should be the same every week. There is a great difference between our singing such a bhajan occasi- onally when we feel inclined to do so and fixing a certain day for the purpose. Why do we recite certain verses every day? For that very reason it seems to me that the feeling that one day in the week at least we establish a bond of unity with Muslims is not altogether meanin- gless. Now do what seems best to all of you there. I have put before you my real conviction in this matter, but I don’t press you to accept
 
 my suggestion. And if you decide to select a bhajan, “Hai bahare bagh”libtech_143_footnotelibtech_144_footnoteis certainly the best, for not only was it dear to Maganlal but we have been singing it from our days in South Africa. It was introd- uced there at the suggestion of a pure-hearted Muslim youth.libtech_145_footnotelibtech_146_footnoteThat youth then passed away, so that for us the song has more in it than its literal meaning. The song was so dear to that youth that, when he came  to  the  line  “Yad kar tu ay Nazir kabronke roz”libtech_147_footnotelibtech_148_footnotehe  used  to substitute his name, Hasan, for Nazir’s Hasan was a frequent visitor to Phoenix. To me he was another son, and we sang that song not once but several times in Phoenix. Hasan played on the piano too, and he often sang it alone to the accompaniment of the piano while we listened. The choice of this bhajan is therefore excellent. Its meaning also is excellent.
 Is Father Elwin being properly looked after? I feel anxious because he has rather delicate health. There is no need to write to Aluvihari about the suitcase. He will send it at his leisure. I had his address, but I do not seem to have preserved it.
 Puratan is in Bhavnagar. The letter will most probably reach him if addressed c/o “Dakshinamurti”.
 Vallabhbhai draws my attention to the printed words on one corner of the Ashram envelope, “Satyagraha Ashram, Udyog Mandir, Sabarmati”. Why both “Satya” and “Udyog”? When I looked at the words, my eyes fell on the letters “B.B.C.I” printed below. Why are they in English? And why at all are they necessary? Assuming that they are necessary, why should we not print “B.B.C.I. Railway” in Hindi? This criticism is too late for the envelopes we have in stock. It is meant only for future guidance.

 Narayanappa has referred to the difficulty experienced in supplying milk to outside customers. In my reply to him, I have asked him to discuss the problem with you. Read that letter.
 June 26, 1932
 It has been argued that, if one is not permitted to get one’s yarn woven into cloth for one’s use, khadi will be costly. Other doubts, too, have been raised. This is how I feel in the matter:
  The 	best thing of 	course is 	that one 	should hand over to 	the Ashram 	all the yarn 	spun by oneself 	and be 	satisfied with 	the khadi 	that one gets as one's share from the stock in the Ashram.  Those 	who are not ready 	to do this 	may hand 	over the yarn 	spun during 	the hour set apart 	for the yajna 	of spinning 	and keep for 	themselves the 	quantity spun at 	other times.  The 	khadi supplied 	to the 	inmates of 	the Ashram 	should be charged 	for at the lowest 	possible rates.  The 	Ashram should always 	have a stock of 	khadi which 	would suit everybody’s requirements.  The 	khadi woven from the 	best yarn spun in 	the Ashram should 	always be sent out.  The 	inmates of 	the Ashram 	should do with 	as coarse 	khadi as they 	can accept 	and be 	happy with it. 	Our idea is 	that we 	wear clothes 	only for 	protecting our 	bodies. We 	will, therefore, 	use the cheapest 	quality and 	the minimum possible quantity.  If 	anybody fears 	that handing over 	all the yarn spun 	by himself 	as his contribution 	to the yajna 	of spinning 	will probably 	kill his 	enthusiasm for 	spinning yarn 	of fine 	count, let it 	be killed. Such 	fear has the terrible 	implication that 	the person concerned 	does the 	spinning yajan 	as a task. Dharma 	on the contrary 	tells us that, howsoever 	indifferently we may 	spin or 	cook for 	ourselves, we 	should do our 	best when spinning 	or cooking 	for others. 	Those who do 	not do 	that do 	not really 	offer yajna but 	merely work. Their yajna 	has no 	meaning and may be 	described as 	hypocrisy. If, 	therefore, our 	 spinning for 	yajan is 	not better 	than or at least 	as good 	as our 	spinn- ing 	previously, we shall have failed in the test. 
 Let everybody think over this and then express his or her desire. Every person will act as he wishes. There is no doubt at all that dharma lies in what I have pointed out. If a person is convinced of what I have said, it is his duty to act accordingly. If, however, anybody cannot do so, simply because he has acted differently up to now, let him do as he wishes. I don’t wish to create any new difficulty for you,  I think I have nothing more to explain,
 My arm is all right more or less. I am continuing milk and bread. It is too early yet to say anything about their effect. There is no cause for worry.
 I hope you do understand that although I write these letters, I am not certain how long I shall be able to go on, I would not be
 surprised if, like the visits, they too are stopped suddenly. We should be quite ready for that too. Of course there is no such possibility just now, but one cannot say when the necessity may arise.
I think I have inflicted a fairly long letter on you this time.

 I got your and Madhavdas’s letters. I hope you keep perfectly fit now. I wish Madhavdas had said something in his letter about his present financial condition. He can write even now. I give complete rest to my arm these days. There is no cause for worry at all. I  suppose you know that Manilal, Sushila and Sita, all three of them were caught in the epidemic of virulent fever in Natal. But there was a letter from Sushila after they had recovered, and that means that they must be on their feet again. I get news about Ramdas’s health from time to time that it is all right.
 Why does Madhavdas remain worried? One never knows when one may lose one’s wealth. One should not rejoice when one has it, nor grieve over its loss. One need not feel ashamed of having become poor and remaining so. Really speaking, poverty is man's natural condition. There only a few in the world who are rich.

 BHAISHRI KHAMBHATTA,
 I got your letter. I was informed about the arrival of the bottle of medicine, but Major Bhandari hesitates to let me use it. He says that it is a camphor liniment described in British Pharmacopoeia and that it smells very strong and may, therefore, injure the skin. If there is any ill effect, he would be held responsible. If he knows the composition of the solution and thinks that the strength of the ingredients is light enough, he may let me use it. That being the position, if you yourself make the oil please let him know its composition and also describe your experience of its effects. He may then let me use it. I pressed him to permit me to use it, but as he mentioned his responsibility I have kept quiet. The pain in the elbow has not increased. I give it complete rest, of course.
 Blessings to you both from

  	I have a letter from Ramdas in which he says that it was not proper 	for you to have given up ghee without corresponding with him. 	He also wishes that I should write to you in the matter and explain 	to you your duty. He says, too, that he had not ordered you to give 	up cinnamon and clove. At any rate, after seeing me he had given up 	the idea altogether. He says moreover, that for the sake of the 	children also, you ought not to give up ghee. I agree with 	all this. It was your duty to have asked Ramdas what was the right 	thing to do. He does not in the least wish to order you. He has 	never believed that you are his subjects. Surely you ought to have 	ascertained the full facts from the person on whose account you 	wished to take a vow. Also, under the Ashram rules, you must 	obtainthe Manager’s permission to undertake anything by way of 	expiation. You have not 
 done that either. Looking at the matter from every point of view, therefore, I feel that you should give up your resolve not to take ghee.
 I hope the children are all right now. Narandas says in his letter that their illness had somewhat frightened you. Illness comes and goes. Why should it frighten one? It is certainly no easy matter to be a mother. A mother may look after her children as well as she can. Then, whether the children keep good health or bad, live or die, is in the hands of God. And this applies to all living beings alike. Therefore, why grieve? On the contrary, giving way to grief interferes with the nursing of the ill.
 Be regular in writing to me. Start taking ghee and inform Ramdas that you have done so. You know well enough how Ramdas worries about you.

 not reading the latter. But Upton Sinclair is not a writer to be despised. A propagandist novel cannot be dismissed from an idea that propaganda as such is a fault in it. A propagandist devotes all his powers to the production of his work. He makes no secret of his purpose, and still does not let the interest flag in his story. Uncle Tom’s Cabin is propaganda pure and simple, but its art is inimitable. Sinclair is a great reformer and writes with a view to promoting reforms; yet it is said, all his works are interesting. I propose to read them if I have the time.

 76. LETTER TO SUMANGAL PRAKASH
 June 29, 1932
 DEAR SUMANGAL,
 Your letter to hand. Your argument with regard to rape seems convincing. In circumstances similar to those in which you believe it right for a woman to take her life, it may be right for a trustee to take his life when somebody tries to rob the property under his care. But the woman and the trustee themselves should think that it is their dharma to do so. You or I have no right to accuse a woman of failingin her dharma if she does not kill herself to prevent herself from being raped. If, unlike her, the trustee dies while defending the property under his care, we cannot assume, either, that he has done the right thing. We can judge in either case only if we know the mental condition of the person concerned at the time. Though I say this from the point of view of justice, personally I believe that a woman, if she has courage, would be ready to die to save her honour. In discussing this matter with women, I would, therefore, certainly advise them to kill themselves in such circumstances and explain to them that it was easy to take one’s life if one wished to do so. I would do this because many women believe that, if there is no man present to protect them or if they have not learnt to use a dagger or a gun, they have no choice but to submit to the evil-doer. I would certainly tell a woman who believes so, that she need not depend upon anybody’s weapons to protect her and that her own virtue will protect her. Even if that does not happen, instead of using a dagger or any other weapon she can kill herself. She need not consider herself weak or helpless.
 And now concerning hypothetical questions. I had understood your purpose in asking the questions to be exactly  what you explain  it to be, but I would describe such questions as hypothetical. In some cases questions of this nature may be asked, but it would be better not to ask any. In any case, you should not make it a habit of asking such questions. Anybody who does that commits the same error which a student of geometry who asks his professor to solve riders does. Such a student will never learn geometry well. That will also be the fate of a person who seeks the solutions of problems arising out of a principle from other people. Apart from this, however, there is a great flaw in the very nature of questions raised on the basis of ethical principles, namely, we never come across in life an instance exactly similar to the one we had imagined. If there is ever so slight a difference between the hypothetical case and the actual one, the answers in the two cases are likely to be entirely different. That is why I have cautioned you that, if you are not confronted with a problem relating to an actual instance which you have come across, you should not make it a habit to seek from me solutions of hypothetical problems in order to be prepared for such eventualities. If you do that, my answers to hypothetical questions will, instead of helping you in an emergency, prevent you from finding the right solution. The mind of such a person becomes incapable of original thinking. The better thing would be to grasp the basic principle thoroughly and to assimilate it, and not to mind if, in applying it in solving your problems or those of other members in your family, you make mistakes. You will learn from such mistakes, But you should not approach others, even those who understand the principle better than you do, to seek solutions of hypothetical problems in order to prepare yourself to meet them when they arise. Such a procedure destroys one’s self-confidence. The author of the Gita seems to have written verse 10 of Chapter  X  because he knew this from experience. Doesn’t the Lord tell us in that verse that “to these, ever in tune with Me, worshipping Me with affectionate devotion. I give the power of selfless action, whereby they come to Me.” If you substitute “Truth” for “God” in this sentence, the meaning will be perfectly clear. I hope you now understand what I meant to say. I do not mind your hypothetical questions, but I fear that I may do you harm by encouraging you to put such questions. I am sure at any rate that I would not be helping you.  Take,  for instance, your question regarding rape. Though I may give a definite reply now to your question regarding a hypothetical instance, I would
 give quite a different reply if an instance like that actually occurred, and support it with convincing reasons. It is also very possible that I would be able to point out a difference between the hypothetical case and the actual incident. I write all this from experience about coworkers. I will stop here now.
I am glad to learn that your health has improved.
 Blessings from

   A LETTERlibtech_158_footnote  
 June 29, 1932
 Why should you wish to commit suicide? So far as I know, you have not deceived anyone. And since you have resolved never to speculate in future, that chapter is closed. Even if you have deceived anybody, that is no reason for committing suicide. A person who confesses that he has deceived people is better than other who deceive but who are not found out or than those who have not been put in circumstances in which they would feel tempted to deceive. You have, therefore, no reason for committing suicide. And now about the problem of debt. If you hand over everything you have to your creditors, your responsibility will be over. If the creditors declare you insolvent, let them do so. There is nothing to be ashamed of even in that. Manliness lies in facing whatever happens. I have already written to you and told you how you may live now. Both of you should go and live in the Ashram. Do not feel the slightest hesitation in doing so. Do not be proud and think that, now that you are a poor man, you cannot go to a place where you often used to go in the days of your prosperity. The Ashram exists for good people. Write to me from time to time. Seek Mirabehn’s company for what comfort it can give you. Know that good company is like a philosopher's stone and be near her.

  	Being anxious to send to Damodardas and his wife a comforting 	letter, I wrote at once yesterday so as to catch the post. I hope 	you got the two letters and gave them to the friends. It is sad that 	loss of wealth should so affect people.  	Where are your Urdu-English and English-Urdu dictionaries? I need 	them badly. My Urdu studies are growing. I am reading fairly 	extensively. I must, therefore, enrich my Urdu collection of books. 	There are several books at the Ashram. I propose to send for them. There 	is nothing to report just now about my health.  	The improvement you notice in your system is certainly very 	encouraging. The increase in milk and fruit was necessary.  	I was glad Verrier was able to go to England after all. The visit 	must renew his shattered body. And his mother and sister will be 	overjoyed to have him in their midst. There 	is no reply to my   letterlibtech_159_footnotelibtech_160_footnoteabout 	 you.  There  may  be  no reply! It 	is good thing Shantabai is giving some time regularly to spinning.  	Tilak should take all the rest he may need. He must build up his 	body.  	Noorbanu does not take enough exercise. Do coax her to take long 	walks. And if you can persuade her to go without salt and ghee for a 	month, she will lose much of her superfluous fat.  	For the cadence of Ramanama, you should get hold of Panditji when he 	passes through Bombay. I think he could recommend one of his 	fellow-teachers of  the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya if you wrote to him. 	You would learn it in half an hour’s time. Who 	are the principal members of the International Fellowship 
 now?   You will send my love 	to all the friends in Europe, and    
 Mahadev's too, and to the Oxford uncle and his wife, and kisses to the beautiful baby. I can never forget that visit, the quiet home and the very beautiful chapel attached to it.

Of course you remember Sardar 	Vallabhbhai. He and Mahadev are with me. We are all keeping well 	trying to made ourselves useful. Mahadev and I give fair time to 	spinning and studying. Sardar produces wealth by making envelopes 	from waste brown paper and the like. This will be enclosed in one 	such envelope.  	I do hope you did not find the Indian climate too trying for you.     
 I wonder if you often see the Rollands. When you do please give our love to them and accept it for yourselves.

    CHI. 	BHAU,  	Jamnalalji has already sent me three copies of Vinoba’s  Gitailibtech_163_footnote. Your constipation must be cured. If necessary, 	consult Dr. Talwalkar about it. Its effect may not be felt much now, 	but it is bound to become serious in future. I will suggest one 	remedy which has helped me. You may try it for two or three days 	and, if it does not work, give it up. Eat twice or thrice a day 	cooked  tandaljalibtech_164_footnoteor palaklibtech_165_footnoteleaves—eat nothing else. This is likely to help 	you. As soon as you pass stools normally, resume your normal food. 	The immediate, and unfailing, remedy for migraine is the application 	of a mud-pack. Bind it when retiring. If the headache still occurs 	on the next day, apply the pack again and lie down.  	I think that the image of the Lord reclining on the Sheshalibtech_166_footnotehas some mystic significance and does not contradict 	the idea of his being ceaselessly active. The word  atandrita in 	that verselibtech_167_footnotecan 	 only  mean doing everything with perfect vigilance and without 	lethargy. It does not mean working all the twenty-four hours of the 	day. This can be said about God’s manner of working as contrasted 	with that of unenli- ghtened human beings, and the verse only draws 	such a contrast. In truth, however, God is neither awake nor asleep. 	He neither does anything nor does nothing. It is therefore, not 	possible to compare        
 Him with anything. After saying this, I may add that this is how I interpret the image of the Lord reclining on Shesha: that God is so perfectly free from fear that He can sleep soundly even with His head on the body of a snake. I interpret it thus for my own satisfaction and the meaning gives me strength. That is, if we are filled with perfect ahimsa, we would not feel the slightest fear even in the presence of a snake and, more than that, the snake would have no fear of us.

Otherwise, only their handwriting will improve 	and their language will not improve. The questions also should be 	their own. There is no rule that they must ask questions. They 	should describe what new things they have learnt during the week, 	what they have observed, what made them happy or unhappy, or things 	which happened during the week or have left an impression on their 	minds. This will mean more work for you, but you can teach them to 	write about these things even during their Hindi lessons.

  	I regard you as being three years old.libtech_168_footnotelibtech_169_footnoteWhat 	you say is correct. When I brought you along with me from Bombay, I 	was doubtful whether you would continue in the Ashram, though not a 	much as you believe I was. For you had kept your promise, and I do 	not feel doubtful about anyone who keeps his or her promise. I do 	not think there was sarcasm in my words, but I was not sure that you 	would continue as long as you have done. I recollect this to be the 	state of my mind then. I certainly wish that you should spend your 	whole life there as you have spent three years and that through 	deliberate resolution, not aimlessly, with the firm conviction that 	you belong to the Ashram and the Ashram belongs to you. But, of 	course, I cannot force you to do this. I may only wish that you 	should do so. You cannot make up your mind to stay on unless you 	sincerely feel that the Ashram belongs  to  you.  I  have  merely  	expressed  my  wish. This refers to your second birth in the Ashram. 	The other birthday falls on July 13 and you should get this letter 	about the 8th. You have my blessings, of course. May your highest 	aspirations be fulfilled! I have no doubt that they will be, since 	you are alert and striving with that aim. You should also have 	sufficiently long life and good health for that purpose. I am sure 	you will have them too. But, ultimately, none of these things 	depends on you or me. We trust everything to Him. He may do as He 	wills. And whatever He does will be 	for the best.  	Send to me your account for the 13th. Tell me what resolution you 	make on that day. I suppose you know that I advise everyone to make 	a good resolution on his or her birthday.  	Put no trust in the predictions of astrologers. Do not take any 	interest in the matter at all. Even if such predictions come true, 	there is no benefit in knowing them. The harm is plain.  	It is hot there. But here it is very cool. There has not been much 	rain, though.    
 Send to me soon the following Urdu books—as many biographies of the Prophet as you can find, the two parts of Asva-e- Saheba, Khulfa-e-Rashdin and the English-Urdu and Urdu-English dictionary. If you can send them to Dahyabhai in Bombay, he will bring them here on Saturday.
 All the buildings should be cleaned regularly on fixed days. The luggage should be lifted and the spot cleaned. You must find the necessary time for this.
 It is our duty to try to raise to perfection whatever we find imperfect, whether a person or a society or an institution. If on the whole we find more shortcomings than good points, our duty is to leave the person or the thing, non-co-operate with him or it. This is a universal principle and I asked you to follow it. In doing so, I did not wish to advise you to leave the Ashram, or anything else. I only explained to you what is accepted as everyone’s moral duty in certain circumstances.
 In Bengal, hundreds of sheep and goats are slaughtered in broad daylight every day and offered as sacrifice to the Goddess Durga in Calcutta. I pray to God to make me a fit instrument for stopping this. Didn’t you know this?libtech_170_footnote
 I knew that men often describe themselves as  gopislibtech_171_footnote. If this is done purely through bhakti, I see nothing wrong in it. Before God all of us are the weaker sex.
 When we have swaraj, men will certainly come forward to climb the top of the Himalayas or discover the North Pole. I do believe that knowledge of the physical sciences is useful.
 My experiments in diet have done me no harm. They have lasted for periods ranging between seven days and eight years.

 DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS,
 It is not right that Premabehn should suggest the  questions which you ask. The questions must be of interest to you, and you should be eager to know their answers. They should be such as  nobody there can answer. Questions should not be asked for the sake of asking them. Your letters should contain a report of the work done during the week. Work includes study also.
Now the questions :
 For the past many years my life has come to be exclusively devoted to public work.
 Pure food is that which involves the minimum destruction of life and which is taken merely for the sustenance of the body.
 The motive behind pilgrimage should always be religious. But religious actions also serve practical ends. Religion ought not to be— cannot be—antagonistic to true practical ends.
The chief characteristic of virtuous life is sat, i.e., truth.
In your letters your grammar and spellings must be correct.

   LETTER TO BABALBHAI MEHTA  
 July 1, 1932
 
 CHI. BABALBHAI,
 Bhakti means silent [and continuous] repetition of God’s name in one’s heart. God means the One Essence manifested as all living creatures. Hence the bhakta is a person who serves all living creatures through love of God. You have correctly interpreted the meaning of
 the injunction: “Do everything as sacrifice to me”.libtech_172_footnote
 Your interpretation of the other verse, too, is correct. For stilling the movements of the  chitta libtech_173_footnote, observance of the  yamaniyamaslibtech_174_footnoteis the chief thing. The same idea is expressed in two different ways: “Do everything as sacrifice to me” and “Renounce the fruits of action.” People of a certain nature will understand the first easily and people of another type will understand the second easily.
 The condition of my elbow is not as serious as you seem to think it is. The only thing is that it pains when I use the arm in a particular manner. Kakasaheb’s health is definitely improving. Do not worry if you feel when reading the Gita that your life is contrary to the teaching of every verse. Instead, you should try to overcome your shortcomings patiently but with determination, no matter even if there is a whole heap of them, as big as a hill. As you go on trying, a day will come when all of them will disappear together. If, however, looking at the hill you get discouraged and stop trying, the hill will become bigger and bigger.

Live as if you had never read anything. Whatever you have digested and assimilated will of itself bear fruit as action.

    LETTER TO SWAMI ANAND     Bhai 	anandanand    July 	1, 1932 
  	You made me wait for a long time. Sardar asked me several times why 	your letter was still not received. We knew that it was not received 	But what can you do? Even if the reason is known, one does hope for 	a thing which one ardently desires. You will receive this letter or 	it will  come back to me.libtech_181_footnotelibtech_182_footnoteMany 	of those who have come in contact with me had similar experience 	about separation as you have got,      
 though   I   am   near   you.libtech_183_footnoteYou   are   to   draw   as   much   satisfaction therefrom as you can. Kallenbachlibtech_184_footnotelibtech_185_footnotehad laid down a fine standard. His experience was that when he first came in contact with me, he met me daily and took as much of my time as he could; when we came in very close contact and began to live together he had hardly time to talk with me though we lived, ate and slept together. While returning home from office, there were always some people talking with us. So, that became a regular matter of quarrel between us. He applied the rule of three and came to the conclusion that it was his experience that the more one came into contact with me, the more he remained away from me. I supported his statement and added, “You have come so near me because you have understood me. Hence you have no right to take my time now nor have I the right to spare time for  you, leaving aside those who have yet to know me.”And  on this understanding our affairs  went  on.  Is  it  not  that  there  is  some  truth underlying such experience, viz., that in the case of associates who  are  closely  united  with  one  another  there  remains   nothing  to make inquiries about? If they do so they may be said to fail to thatextent in their general duty. And if this is true, associates like you who are near, though living at a distance, have no reason to feel sorrowful about.libtech_186_footnotelibtech_187_footnoteI did know that your weight had gone down, but I had no fears about your health. The Magan spinning-wheel is not a modified or improved form of the Gandiva wheel. It is a distinct, useful and excellent discovery made by Prabhudas.libtech_188_footnotelibtech_189_footnoteIts wheel can be worked by foot instead of by hand, and so both the hands being free, two spindles can be worked simultaneously. Hence he who becomes an expert in working it can without doubt spin one and a half times, if not double, of what he can do on a one-spindle wheel. I did want to work the wheel to satisfy Prabhudas. In the mean time the doctors here prohibited me from drawing the yarn or working the wheel with the left hand. So there was a twofold reason for me to work the Prab-
 hudas wheel. As Maganlal encouraged the making of that wheel and contributed largely to the scientific side of it, it has been  named Magan Rentio. I am spinning on it at present. The speed has reached about 140 rounds. It will still go up. From the above remarks, I hope you have understood that I have been spinning only on one spindle because, giving complete rest to the left hand, I draw the thread with the right.
 The yarn is of 19 counts. There us nothing to fear about the hand. When it is used in doing a particular kind of work, the elbow is aching and  doctors  persistently  believe  that  the  complaint is  not due to any internal cause, but it is due to an external cause, viz., due to the drawing of threads daily. So, they are of the opinion that by giving rest to the muscles the complaint will subside by itself. Despite this, that part is treated by [ultra-]violet rays. Hence there is no cause for anxiety. My weight has failed to go up to 112 lb. It has not exceeded 106libtech_190_footnotelibtech_191_footnote/2lb. I have been taking milk for the last ten days under pressure from the Superintendent. I am yet unable to say that I have benefited by it. My present weight is 104 lb. Sardar is doing well. His weight may be said to be the same as it was when he came (here). It can be said that the nose complaint is under slight control. The weight of Mahadev is also good. His health is excellent. Mahadev had been spinning 840 yards of yarn of No. 45 to 50 up to the day before yesterday. He spent about five hours daily on it. As he also felt the effects of exertion, he spins half the amount of yarn for the last twodays and is doing carding work, of course, in addition. I spin 200 yards of yarn. I study Urdu, astronomy and books on currency and write the history of the Ashram when I get time. Mahadev is reading on stray subjects. He has, of course, in addition, to write for me. Now the spinning having been reduced, he may, perhaps, begin to write something. Sardar produces wealth from dust, in other words, he has been   making   envelopes   from   wastepaper   of   badami1       and   other colours. If I were to give you a description of the papers, you will laugh a lot. To whomsoever we have to write a letter, we make use of these envelopes. As we do not differentiate between Government money and ours, we save every cowry where possible. The making of envelopes is undoubtedly an addition to the wealth of India or that of the world, however small it may be. Keeping in mind that every-
 
 thing that is used as Government property is our property, we make use of it. Sardar is spending time also in reading and has  thought of acquiring a working knowledge of Sanskrit. He has also called for the Sanskrit Pathamala  by Satavlekarlibtech_192_footnotelibtech_193_footnoteand intends side by side to be will versed in Hindi too. This is the account of our work. Our family consists of a cat and her two kittens. Though their names are not entered in the history ticket, they share a little of milk, etc.libtech_194_footnote
 I have completed reading Rolland’s books on Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. I always had reverence for Ramakrishna I had read little about him. But as I had heard several things about him from his devotees, that feeling had sprung up. I cannot say that  Rolland’s books have added to it. In fact both the books of Rolland are meant for Westerners. I will not say that we can derive nothing from these books. But I for one have derived very little benefit. The things which had influenced me are also to be found in Rolland’s books. The additional matter which it contains has not added to the impression. It did not appear to me that Vivekananda was as much a devotee as Ramakrishna. Vivekananda’s love was great. He was full of feeling and used to be carried away by it. It was like the golden covering for his knowledgelibtech_195_footnotelibtech_196_footnoteThe distinction which he made between religion and politics was not correct. But it is no use criticizing such a great man and once we let loose ourselves we can criticize anyone whom we wish to. Our duty lies in learning anything we can from [the lives of] such persons. As Tulsidas’s couplet has produced a deep impression on my life, I do not like to criticize. But as I know that you will wish to know if I have to offer anything by way of criticism, I have written this much. I have no doubt that Vivekananda rendered great service. We have clearly seen that he gave his life for what he considered to be the truth. When I went to see the Belur Math in 1901,   I desired to see Vivekananda also. But the Swami of the  Math informed me that he was ill and resided in the city and no one could see him. I was then disappointed. My devotion had saved me from many difficulties. At that time there was not a single notable person whom I did not run up to see with feelings of respect and I used to go to most of the places on foot on the long roads in Calcutta. Devotion inspired all this. I had no desire to save money though this is also in
 
 
 my naturelibtech_197_footnote
 Respects from all three of us to Abdulla Sheth, Jabir Ali, Soman, Gokulbhai, Vishwanath, and all others. I hope you will admit now that  I have written at greater length than you might have wished.

   LETTER TO KISHORELAL G. MASHRUWALA  
 July 1, 1932
 DEAR KISHORELAL,
 I was waiting for your letter. I do not wish you to write to me, making use of the occasion when it is necessary for you to write to anybody else. But do write to [me] when you can easily do so. Devdas was suffering from mild typhoid. But now he is entirely cured. I receive letters from him. He was taken good care of. He is getting books to read. Ramdas is here and is all right. Chhaganlal, Surendraji, Darbari and several others are with him. Qureshi is also there. Ramniklal, Kanti, Surendra, Vithal, Fulchand, Diwan Master and several others are in Visapur jail. Jamnalal, Pyarelal, Vinoba, etc., are in Dhulia jail. There the Gita is being studied with great enthusiasm. Manilal, Sushila, Sita, Pragji all had an attack of the poisonous fever prevailing in Natal. But all have been saved. Pragji is not willing to undertake responsibility.libtech_198_footnotelibtech_199_footnoteSo Manilal is engaged and it seems that he will not come. Gangabehn, Tara, Mahalakshmi, Rama, Gangabehn Jhaveri, Nanibehn, Bhaktibehn, Shanta, Lilavati Asar, etc., are here. As doctors believe that my hand complaint is due to exertion, I have been giving rest to it. The complaint is not permanent. It recurs when a particular kind of work is done. As an experiment, it is given diathermy; but the doctors here believe that rest is the only remedy for that part of the hand. It is not necessary even to direct a thought over it. I have been taking milk nearly for the last ten days. My weight is 104 lb. The reason for taking milk is that the Superintendent here is pressing for it. I did not think that it was essential. But as the weight
 
 was going down, I gave up my determination. I am working Prabhudas’s spinning-wheel by foot and am drawing the thread with the right hand. It is working well. Sardar and Mahadev are doing well. The nose complaint in of Sardar is lying dormant for the present. The complaint in the leg-bone from which Mahadev was suffering was completely cured in a few days after he came here. Mahadev spins yarn of 40/50 counts. He is doing some carding work and reading, of course, in addition to what he has to write for me. Sardar is reading and adding to the wealth of the world by making envelopes from seless badami paper. As we do not differentiate between the Government and other property, we hold the so-called Government property to be ours and make a careful use of everything. Such troubles as you infer should not arise from the working  of the Gandiva spinning-wheel. Its wheel should work without the least trouble. It requires only a gentle push. But if you believe that though the wheel of the Gandiva spinning-wheel you have been using is turning very lightly, yet your wrist is aching, then you should use a spinning-wheel with a perpendicular wheel even for the sake of removing your doubt. That your weight is increasing can indeed be regarded as good news. The diagnosis of the doctor about the asthma may be correct and if two grains of quinine every day cures the trouble, it should be regarded to be very good.
 I had written on prayerslibtech_200_footnotelibtech_201_footnoteand on subject like that of the regula- tions to be observed by satyagrahilibtech_202_footnotelibtech_203_footnote; but not on this subject However, I have not got a copy of the same. But as you refer to it, I shall call for  it and correct errors in it and send it to you, if possible. It will not be regarded, I feel confident, as a letter. There is indeed pressure of work in the Ashram. Shankarbhailibtech_204_footnotelibtech_205_footnotewrites the Ashram letter when he gets leisure. Several essential things are left out in it. I have kept up the idea of reading your book carefully, but believing that I have ample time I do not turn to it, leaving aside what I have been reading at present. You have done well in going through the Gita again. If you send it here, I will get it.libtech_206_footnoteI do not desire   to recommend you to read anything special.libtech_207_footnoteI do not believe that you have read less. My own reading can indeed be regarded as being quite odd. I have been reading Urdu at present. As my ignorance on currency is unpardo-
 
 nable, I have been making some progress in the subject. The spirit of service lies behind both of these, and submitting to this spirit, though I can be regarded to be on the eve of death, I aspire to have a good knowledge of Tamil which has been left incomplete; and from this point of view I had begun to read Bengali and Marathi, and I shall not be surprised if I plunge into their study if a good time is passed here. If your mind is working in any such direction and if you desire to know any new language do not fail to do so. We had this aspiration about languages when the Ashram was established. It has not weakened at all so far as I am concerned. But I do not desire to draw you under this temptation. The one necessity which I see for all of us is that we should think on what we have read, digest it and make it a feature of our life. From this viewpoint I have gone even to the length of advising Bhagwanjilibtech_208_footnotelibtech_209_footnoteto give up (the reading of)  Gita  and writings of Raichandbhai and to remain engaged in his own work and think over it alone; because I found that he had crammed much from the Anasaktiyoga and the writings of Raichandbhai, but he was unable to make the right use of all these. His heart, I believe, is clean, but his intellect defeats him, he indulges in various thoughts and at last he remains where he is. My writing appears to have produced a deep effect on him and he is appeased. Whatever may be the result of this advice, it has become clear to me from several experiences that the line of thought behind it is quite correct. Accordingly I cannot think of recommending the reading of religious books to persons like you.libtech_210_footnoteI agree to a certain extent with the realization by you of defects in you. I have, however, marked many times that you are in the habit of entering into discussions. You appear to have taken an exaggerated view of this defect in your letter. I see no reason for it. But I am, indeed, of opinion that much of the discussion can be curtailed. This does not mean that you should not reply to what one asks you. If one does not ask a man like you, whom will one ask? It is one thing to give to an inquisitive [man] what one can out of what one has, and to enter into discussion is quite a different mater. Do not be confused by interpreting these observations of mine in an unwarranted manner. Do not uselessly reprove yourself also after deep introspection. My supp- ort is not intended to magnify the defects you have seen, but is meant to explain their proportion. In order to live with ease with persons of queer nature, silence is indeed greatly essential. We must understand
 
 available in Bombay Secret Abstracts.
 that we have not known religion until we are able to maintain calmness though we live in society.
 Imitation of Christ is a treasure of experiences of a real man. So it cannot but produce effect. I will tell you how I was induced to study the sky. When I accidentally found that it had become for me a means of seeing God, I looked at it at once. Kaka was with me. He induced me much, But my mind turned me aside from it. ‘When I got leisure from other work I would do it’ was the feeling. In 1922 when I was here, I had collected books on the subject. At that time also, I was deferring this study for one reason or another. Shankerlal gradually studied the subject himself. I was induced several times to see Cassi- opeia. After seeing a little I engaged myself again in my worklibtech_211_footnotelibtech_212_footnoteBut at this time thoughts came to me suddenly that the sight of the sky wasequivalent  to   a  valuable   religious  association. The  stars	were silently talking with us. I do not wish to dilate upon all these thoughts. In short what I want to say is that when everything becomes a religious lesson for me, then only I dive into it and now I cannot come out of it.
 As much time has passed, I do not lengthen the letter now. If this letter will reach you safely, I will write again further.

        CHI. 	MANI libtech_216_footnote,    LETTER TO MANIBEHN PATEL      July 	2, 1932 
  	I got your letter. I hope you received my message. Since you 	intended to send the slivers, you have earned the merit which you 	would have done if you had sent them. You did well, however, not to 	send any. No bad slivers are now left here. The slivers we have got 	are enough. Mahadev has made  as  many  as  we  need.  They have 	been accumulating for the last two months. Mahadev mostly uses the 	slivers sent by Chhakkaddas, because they are made from superior 	cotton and with great care. I shall never be able to spin on the    
 Magan  charkha  as  fine yarn  as  Mahadev  does.  I  have  always held the view—and I am sure I am right—that yarn spun for yajna should never be used for oneself. If a man who spins for yajna is careless, he has been weighed in the balance and found wanting.
 The yarn spun for yajna should be spun with the utmost care. It would be best if one gives away all the yarn spun by oneself and uses whatever bad or good yarn one can get. If one does not have the heart to do so, one should at any rate spare one hour or half an hour daily for yajna and spin at least 160 rounds of yarn as an offering to Lord Krishna.
 I can easily understand your preferring group prayer, for you started praying in that manner. But you must also pray by yourself, even if it be only for one minute. Our aspiration should be that ultimately we shall continually and silently go on repeating God’s name in our heart, and that is impossible unless one forms the habit of praying, by oneself. One can pray by oneself even while lying in bed, bathing, eating or doing any other work. Thus it can never be a burden. On the contrary, such prayer will lighten one’s  heart—it ought to do so. If you do not get such experience, then you may know that your prayer is not from the heart.
 Dahyabhai’slibtech_217_footnoteproblem is a little difficult. But he is very sensible and, therefore, will himself recover his balance of mind. Nobody need advise him in this matter. If he wishes to marry again, nobody can dissuade him from doing so. If, on the contrary, he does not wish to marry again, nobody can tempt him to do so either. Acquaintances will certainly pester him, but Dahyabhai can deal with them. In any case you will be able to deal with them. On such occasions, I feel the sacrifice of having stopped seeing visitors, but it is our duty to bear such sacrifices. My left elbow pains when I work with the arm in a particular manner. A servant has been washing my clothes for about a month. I use utensils supplied in the jail. They are not shining bright, but are clean. Take care of your health and write to me regularly.

        DEAR 	. . . ,    LETTER TO A FRIENDlibtech_218_footnote      July 	2, 1932 
  	Your letter and diary to hand. Is the diary to be returned or should 	I tear it off? Your disease is an old one. But do not lose heart. 	Pray to God daily for purity and your passions will subside.  	. . . was not at fault in sending the mangoes (to you). If you 	really did not want them, you ought to have given them away to 	somebody—some labourer. Then . . . would not have sent again. A 	woman decidedly knows the weakness of her husband and, labouring 	under false affection , nourishes it (weakness). If the husband 	remains true (to himself), he abandons the weakness, and the woman 	will not tempt him.  	Moreover, what is the fault of . . . ? I believe what . . . says. 	She has no desire for carnal pleasures. She does not become 	passionate towards any man. Hence there is no reason to doubt her. 	But  supposing that she tells a lie; yet, what is the object in 	doubting her? A woman cannot doubt her husband. She puts up with the 	enjoyment of carnal pleasures by her husband. Why should a man keep 	a watch over and be angry with her. Let the woman behave as she may. 	If she does not want to be chaste, the husband cannot make her 	preserve her chastity by force. Purity belongs to those who remain 	pure. Hence, it is deemed proper that you should drive away even 	from your mind the idea of finding fault with . . . Such 	fault-finding causes the ruin of you both. Also it is sinful and 	unjust to involve another man on suspicion. It is entirely a sign of 	weakness. Drive away this weakness. You have done well in putting 	down such things in your diary. May 	God grant you peace and purity. Vithaldas must be doing 
 well.   Blessings 	from  BAPU  Bombay 	Secret Abstracts, Home Department, Special Branch, File No. 800

   LETTER TO MAGANBHAI PATEL  
 July 2/3, 1932
 BROTHER MAGANBHAI,
 Raojibhai’s letter about his lands to hand. In it he writes that you see the necessity of selling the lands, and also believe that the lands will not fetch as much price in the absence of Raojibhai as they would have, if he were present. Instead of coming to a decision himself, Raojibhai has left it to me and Sardar (Vallabhbhai  Patel)  to decide (the matter). On consultation we have decided that you know most in this matter. There cannot be enough materials before Raojibhai or ourselves to arrive at a decision. Even if you make endeavours and supply us as much information as might be needed, yet it might be considered insufficient. In such matters, decision cannot be and should not be reached without one being actually on the spot. Hence we have cone to the decision that you should do whatever is proper to be done having regard to the circumstances. If you think that is should be sold, you should sell it without any hesitation. And if you feel that it can be kept—must be kept—then wait till Raojibhai is released. You do without fear whatever is more advantageous. We both of us know that Raojibhai is keen on setting apart a piece of land sufficient for building as ashram for the Dharalas. But, if in carrying  out  that  object,  less  price  is  realized for the lands or if any debt still remains unpaid, it is not necessary to insist on that. If there is any need for an ashram, it will be seen through when Raojibhai is released.

   HOW TO OBSERVE TRUTHlibtech_225_footnote  
 Sunday, July 3, 1932libtech_226_footnoteWhat I said about ahimsalibtech_227_footnotelibtech_228_footnotealso applies to truth. If we split hairs about issues such as whether one may or may not tell a lie to save a
 cow and ignore what is daily happening before us, we cannot follow truth. By raising such complicated issues we make truth difficult to discover. If we follow truth today in solving the problems which confront us in our daily life, we shall know instinctively how to act in difficult situations when they arise.
 Each of us should examine only himself or herself from this point of view. Do I deceive anybody knowingly? If I believe that B is a bad person but show him that I believe him to be good, I deceive him. Do I try to show, in order to win people’s respect or esteem, that   I possess certain virtues which in fact. I do not possess? Do I exaggerate in my speech? Do I hide my misdeeds from persons to whom I should confess them? If a superior or co-worker puts me any question, do I evade him? Do I keep back what I ought to declare? If I do any of these things, I am guilty of untruth. Everybody should examine his conduct daily in this manner and try to overcome his shortcomings. One to whom truth has become second nature and who has risen to a state so that he can never speak untruth may not do this. But everyone who has the least trace of untruth in him or who can follow truth only with effort should examine himself daily  as explained above and put to himself those or any other similar  questions which may occur to him and reply to them. Anybody who follows this practice even for a month will clearly observe a change having taken place in himself.

    LETTER TO FULCHAND B. SHAH      BHAISHRI 	FULCHAND,    July 	3, 1932 
  	I got your letter of April 31 [sic], 1932, as also 	Raojibhai’s of June 10, 1932, only today. All of us were glad to 	read them. This      
 time 15 lines in your letter were  completely  censored.  If  it  is possible, tell the person who deals with all such letters, or the Superintendent, to show you the portions which he thinks should be censored, so that you may write the letter again. If this is done, the context would not be suddenly broken as happens at present. Tell everybody there not to expect, or wish for, a separate letter from me. Though there is no restriction on me as regards the numbers of letters  I can write, I think I myself should put a limit on it. Hence I write as few letters as I can. But I do reply to letters from co-workers in jails, or write to one of them when there are many co-workers in the same jail. That serves the purpose of writing to all of them. If, however, anybody wishes to write to me about something specially, he may certainly do so, as Raojibhai has done. We shall not often get opportunities like the unique one we have got just now for self- examination and study. All of us, therefore, should realize that we should so act and spend our time that we would be able to give a good account  of  every  moment.libtech_229_footnotelibtech_230_footnoteEven  a  drop  of  water  should   not   be wasted. We should regard everything in the country, no matter in whose possession it is, as belonging to us and take care of it and use it accordingly. It is plain that this serves several purposes. Tell the boys and girls there that, when they can use the permission to write letters, they may write to me if they don’t wish to write to anybody else. It is  a strange thing that the rains have not yet commenced here. By now there should have been quite a good amount of rain. Cultivators are worried. Give the accompanying letter to Raojibhai. That is, what follows is meant for him.
 I have discussed the matter with Sardar and both of us have come to the conclusion that neither (he nor I) can give an opinion from here. We cannot know many of the facts without being present on the spot, and hence I have writtenlibtech_231_footnoteto Maganbhai and told him that he may do what he thinks best, taking into account all the relevant circumstances. I have written to him quite a long letter to this effect. I received your letter doday and am replying immediately. I have thus not delayed by a single moment. Raojibhai should not worry about the matter at all.

         BROTHER 	DINKAR,    LETTER TO DINKAR      July 	3, 1932 
  	Your letter to hand. I have stopped all visits, as the visit of 	Mirabehn has been disallowed. Looking to your weight, it can be 	considered a great improvement (in your health). Nothing can be done 	about sanatorium from here. I have received here a book named Vishva 	Shanti, i.e., world peace. Mahadev and myself have glanced 	through it. I cannot know anything about its good or bad points, 	because, really I have not in me the power to appraise poetry. I 	have not been able to develop that taste. Doctors believe that there 	is nothing else except that my hand has been tired out; hence I am 	giving it rest. I have written by mistake that Mahadev  has  gone 	through Vishva Shanti. He has not read it.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  Bombay 	Secret Abstracts, Home Department, Special Branch, File No. 800 (40) 	(3), Pt. II, p. 109      LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI    June 	28/July 4, 1932  CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	I got your mail today. It is seven days today since I started taking 	milk and fruit. I don’t see any effect on the elbow. Perhaps there 	may be none. I cannot say positively that they have completely 	agreed with me. What had agreed perfectly is the experiment of 	almonds, bread and vegetables. But I will continue milk for  the 	present. I feel slightly afraid of developing constipation. If 	necessary, I will add a little quantity of vegetable. There is no 	cause at all for worry on this account.  	What you say about Sitala Sahay is right. His letter is rude and 	seems to have been written in anger. If his expenditure is more, he 	should send you detailed accounts. If they are all right, there 	should be no objection to paying him more. Hence, instead of fixing 	an abs- olute limit of Rs. 60, it seems to me that the better course 	would be to ask him to send accounts before paying him more. I have 	explained 
 other points fully in my letter of yesterday, and, therefore don’t touch upon them here. I need not write more about the Girl family either.
 If Dhiru and Kusum do less physical work and take enough milk, their weight will increase.
 Do you hear any time from Nirmala Joshi? She may have some information about Lilabehn. Do you know her address?
 Do what you think proper regarding Tituslibtech_232_footnotelibtech_233_footnote. If you are fully sati- sfied with his work and his demand is in accord with his requirements, it may be proper to pay him that much. It is natural that the depend- ents of those who had joined the Marchlibtech_234_footnotelibtech_235_footnoteand who are no longer in the struggle but are employed in some work will expect help from them. If, therefore, we stick to the letter of their pledge, we may perhaps do them injustice.
 Parnerkar’s action is highly improper. It is certainly not right togo away without obtaining permission and send a message afterwards. However, since his motives are good and his mind has become very weak, I don’t wish to censure him. And his sacrifice also has been good. If, therefore, you think it proper send some money to his mother. I know that strict justice will not permit that. But very often cold justice becomes injustice. It is extremely difficult to look into the heart of any human being. Hence, whenever it is a question of paying money, my inclination is always to pay something if we can.
 Where are Ramarao and Pratap at present? It is enough if Father Elwin is satisfied. He would not expect from us the same attention as Mirabehn could give, nor can we fulfil such an expectation. Few persons would be capable of her careful attention to details when she looks after anybody whom she loves. We cannot, therefore, compete with her. It was very good that the matter of Imam Saheb’s tomb was settled.
 You must have read what I wrote to Jivram regarding Anna- purna. Sharat Chandra Patnaik, from what you write about him, seems to be a good man. If he marries Annapurna, his motive would be primarily humanitarian. However, Jivram should approve of him and Annapurna should be willing. If Sharat Chandra knows the whole story of Annapurna’s past and still marries her, he would certainly have my blessings, but he would also deserve compliments.
I suppose you have acknowledged receipt of the various
 
 translations of An Autobiography which you have received. I think Keshu spinning 350 rounds of yarn of 50 counts is good speed. On what type of spinning-wheel does he spin?
 Even those rooms which contain only luggage  should  be opened at regular intervals. It is a practice in big office in charge of buildings that the last date on which each building was cleaned and the next date fixed for its cleaning are shown on some part of it. Even if, therefore, the list of future works does not include those items, the dates would be shown on the buildings. The staff would inspect these dates as a matter of routine, so that, if persons have been appointed to attend to such work, it would be carried out in due time without anybody having to remember the dates.
 For spinning yarn of fine count, besides good slivers the spindle, the belt and the spindle-holder also are relevant factors. You cannot spin yarn of 50 counts even from the best slivers with the type of belt and spindle in the Magan spinning-wheel. The spindle of the spinning-wheel on which the Andhra women spin yarn of 80 counts is extremely fine, like the wires of an umbrella, and quite small. The belt also is very thin. That is why those women are able to spin yarn of such fine count. Examine your spindle and belt from this point of view. My own experience is that we cannot spin on any other type of spinning-wheel as fine yarn and with as much ease as we can on the Gandiva spinning-wheel, and the chief reason for this is the extremely thin belt of the latter. My eyes tell me that such thin belt will not work on a spinning-wheel which stands vertical. Moreover, we can never achieve on the wheel of the latter the same control as on the Gandiva wheel. For the same reason, a delicate spindle bearer like the one with which the Gandiva wheel is fitted will not work on the other types. We ought to master the art of spinning yarn of the finest count, and those who have very much more experience in this field than I should spin for trial on the different types of spinning-wheels and examine them from this point of view.
 I went through your summary. I have said enough on this subject in previous letters,libtech_236_footnoteand so I need not write anything here. You need not continue to send such summaries every week. If you make any changes after studying the figures, please inform me about them. If information from more persons is received and if you have any comments to make, please write. I will preserve the register sent by you, so that, if you refer to it in explaining anything, I will consult it
 
 and find out the point of the reference. Personally, I learn a great deal from such summaries and they also help me to think clearly. You have done well in giving details about every person which help me to identify him or her.
 I see from Panditji’s letter that you observe five minutes’ silence in the morning too. If you have found the result of the practice good, let it be continued. My own suggestion, however, was only for the evening prayer. The inmates attend it after tiring work for the whole day and, therefore, may require a little longer time to concentrate their attention in meditation. Five minutes’ silence will help in acquiring such concentration. At the time of morning prayer the condition is quite the opposite, and so silence may not be necessary  for  the purpose I have explained. Panditji thinks that many of them doze during these five minutes. I have here discussed the necessity or otherwise of five minutes’ silence from a general point of view. From the spiritual point of view, the longer the period of silence during prayer the better it is. But that is only for those who can benefit from
 it. Please do not understand me to mean that the five minutes’ silence in the morning should be stopped. It is obvious that  an excellent practice which has been started ought not to be discontinued in a hurry. I have said all this to tell you that, if you are of the same view as Panditji and would like to reduce five minutes to one minute but refrain from doing so because you had understood my suggestion to mean that I wanted five minutes’ silence at both times, you are free to make a change.
 July 3, 1932
 There was a hint in Panditji’s letter, and Mahadev also tells me, that children do not get enough sleep. They ought to get at least eight hours’ uninterrupted sleep. They can get that only if they go to bed at
 7.30 p.m., assuming that we want them to get up at 3.30 a.m. I also believe that children should get at least eight hours’ sleep. It would be desirable if the grownups also get as many hours of rest. One way of ensuring this would be to start the evening prayer at 7 and finish it at
 7.30 or rather at 7.20. Since half an hour is the minimum  time required for the prayer, it should start at 6.50. Alternatively, [in the morning] the bell should be given at 4 and the prayer should start at
 4.30. Still another way would be to have a separate time for prayer for children, which should be at the commencement of their class. There is, in fact, a prayer at that time. We should be satisfied with that. Apart from that, the children should form the habit of praying [either in the morning or in the evening]. They may pray in the morning whenever they get up. The general time for  rising  should  not   be   later   than
 4 a.m. and morning prayer ought not to start later than 4.30. And the children must get at least eight hours’ sleep. Taking these two conditions as essential, you may make any changes that may appear necessary. You will have to decide who should be counted as children. Boys and girls who are neither children nor adolescents may be counted as children if they wish. The rule for them should be that they may continue to be counted as children for one year at the longest. Those who are ill have always been exempted from attending the morning prayers. Indu and other boys like him should be exempted. whether or not they themselves wish. That is, a boy or girl who is losing weight should not be put to the strain of getting up early. That Indu does not get sleep before ten is certainly not a desirable state of affairs. If his bed is made in the open near yours, he is bound to get sleep. Even though he should be exempted from attending the morning prayer, he must form the habit of sleeping early. Think over all this and make any changes you may think necessary.
 Shamal seems to be troubled in his mind. I have advisedlibtech_237_footnotelibtech_238_footnotehim to have a talk with you. Without waiting for him to come to you, send for him and ask him what his difficulties are.
 There is a letter from Manjula, in which she says that her going to the Ashram has been postponed. Perhaps she has written to you also. She has not given the reason.
 There is no change in the condition of my left arm. It seems that it will improve in course of time purely through rest. You need not worry about it at all. I do take milk to please the Superintendent, but at present at any rate I don’t see that it has benefited me much. However, I am continuing it for the present. Along with it I take rotli, instead of bread, and a vegetable with one of the meals. Just now it is the season for grapes in Karachi. Lalwanilibtech_239_footnotelibtech_240_footnote, therefore, sends parcels of them from time to time and I eat them too. The weight has risen to 104.
 About yarn, if you see Shardabehnlibtech_241_footnoteperhaps you may be able to get yarn spun by women for the yajna of spinning. We must—if we can—discover some means of meeting the acute demand for yarn.
 How do Jamna and Purushottam spend their time in Ranavav? If you know the details of their daily routine, let me have them.
 Inform Ba that I got only one letter written by her. Does she get mine?

Ultimately a contest 	between the two is inevitable as our ideal is to produce khadi in 	all the

 villages. Thus mills will no longer have a place in India when each village can produce khadi. But for the time being people like you can have both the activities at the same time provided the ideal is kept before the public in order to assert the truth. People so inclined will continue to indulge in criticism, it cannot be helped.
 I do not possess sufficient  knowledge  about  jaggery  but  I  have an impression that mills will remain indispensable for the production of sugar. Sugar cannot be easily manufactured in villages, nor can every village grow sugar-cane, which means that production of jaggery cannot be a universal occupation.  Perhaps  I  am  wrong in thinking so. However, if a person can advocate mills as well as khadi he can assuredly talk of jaggery and sugar factories at the same time.
 The more I study of economics the  firmer  I  grow  in  my belief that the methods suggested in these books for eradicating poverty are not at all efficacious. The method lies in working out a scheme wherein the production and consumption happen to be simultaneous and this scheme can work only with the revival of village industries.
 I have started taking milk on the Superintendent’s insistence, also chapati and vegetable. Vegetable, I take once a day and chapati twice a day. But no longer do I notice the cleansing of the bowels that  I experienced formerly on a diet of roti, almonds and a vegetable. But  I will not give up milk in a hurry now that I have started it. I shall watch the results. These days I am taking the grapes sent from Karachi by Kripalaniji’s brother-in-law.

         CHI. 	PREMA,    LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK      July 	6, 1932 
  	I got your letter, By trying to give artistic appearance to the 	envelope, you spoiled it. This is bound to be the result when one 	tries to create beauty which meets no practical need. Sardar makes 	no  effort to give to an envelope artistic appearance for its own 	sake; such appearance is the by-product of practical utility and, 	therefore, please 
 the eye. If we wish to use again an envelope which has been used once, the address written on it should be covered up. For that purpose Sardar stuck over the written lines finely cut slips of paper of appropriate sizes, and that gave the envelope an attractive appearance. But he was not satisfied with this. So now he turns the envelopes received from there inside out, so that he need not paste slips over them and the envelops may look as good as new. You will discover this if you examine them closely. Your slips with zigzag. edges had half come off and looked very shabby. And they served no practical purpose. Your labour, therefore, was wasted, and so were the time and the paper. That was a loss to the public. Draw two lessons from this: never imitate anyone blindly, and beauty created for its own sake is no beauty. It is said about the great cathedrals in Europe that all their beautiful features serve a practical purpose. Whether this is true or not, there can be no doubt about the truth of the principle which I have stated.
 Your letter this time contained very little besides a criticism of the Minister. I think is unnecessary to consider whether or not your criticism is justified, since it can have no effect. The statement “judge not lest ye be judged” deserves to be engraved in our hearts. I do not know if there is a Gujarati saying with a similar meaning. If there is any in Marathi, send it to me.
 I should like to have a list of the Urdu books. In any case, send Shibli’s volume. I know that Khalifa’s biography, too, is there.
 I should certainly like it if you would prefer to die rather than eat fish. Does that mean that you would not take codliver oil too? You need not consider what I would wish [you to do]. I have put the question simple to know your own attitude. You should increase milk/curds and/or ghee in your diet. It must also include occasionally some ripe fruit in place of uncooked vegetable. Don’t you grow papayas there? Or tomatoes? Or bhajilibtech_256_footnotelibtech_257_footnoteof any kind? Why should you, yourself, not grow some tomatoes? And also  lettuce—it  grows quickly. Unripe papay ought not to be eaten in large quantity. Nor should it be eaten daily. Introduce this change without thinking about the expense. Keep up Kuhne-baths with hot water. It is very necessary to massage the spot where you feel the pain. Any girl will be glad to do the massage.
 
 
 Vidya’slibtech_258_footnotelibtech_259_footnotedullness will disappear if you try to teach her with love. Rambhau’s case is a little difficult. There is only one remedy, how- ever. There are three influences working on him. If they do not work in harmony, there will be a problem. The three influences are:  Panditji, Lakshmibehn and you or anybody else who looks after him. Only love will enable you to discover a way out of this difficulty. In the measure that your love becomes wider in scope, in that measure will your capacity to reform such children increase.
 Be generous towards the grown-up girls in the Ashram. They do not purposely shirk work and sit idle at home; they do not work beca- use they become helpless. You and I cannot judge the degree of their helplessness. They alone can do so. Their judgment may, of coures, be wrong. But we should be satisfied if their motive is not dishonest. Among the grown-up girls, think about Anandi, Kusumlibtech_260_footnotelibtech_261_footnoteand Nimu. What could all these girls do? Anandi is not likely to shirk work. Kusam at any rate will never do so. Nimu is burdened with two children. She hardly knows how to bring them up, but has already become a mother. How much work, therefore, can we expect from her? Perhaps you will be able to think of many more instances. We cannot weight all such cases in scales with which we weigh gold and pearls. You will also see from experience that as you become more generous you will find it easier to make others work. I don’t know how far it is true, but is said [about me] that I have great capacity for making men work. If this is true, the reason is that I never suspect anyone of shirking work. I am satisfied with the work that a person does. I then ask him to do more, and he does. There are also somewho say that there will be hardly anyone whom people deceive as much as they do me. Even if this assessment is proved correct, I shall not feel sorry. I would be satisfied if people give me a testimonial that  I deceive no one in the world. If nobody else gives such a testimonial to me, I certainly give it to myself.
I hate untruth more than anything else.
 I don’t believe in the principles of “the greatest good of the greatest number” and “survival of the fittest”. For man the rule is, the good of all, the progress of all and “the weak first”. We bipeds
 
 are human beings, but we have not yet risen above the nature of quadrupeds. Dharma lies in doing so.

   LETTER TO MATHURADAS PURUSHOTTAM  
 July 6, 1932
 CHI. MATHURADAS,
 I got your letter. You should not belittle your idea of sewing for yajna. Its real value lies in turning to use even the poorest quality of khadi. We cannot afford to pay for sewing. However, those who are ready to do sewing as free service can give even to the most unattr- active khadi the value which devotees of God give to flowers  by making garlands for the deity from them. For instance, one who gives such service should not make shirt from bad khadi, but he can make quilts, bagos or pillows from it. We can think of a number of things made from such khadi which would not need to be washed and which could be used for a long time in the same condition. I had a hand spun and hand-woven wollen blanket with me, which I had received as a gift. It had been so much worn out be use that, if used longer, it would have not torn out into pieces. But, being of an ingenious turn of mind and having a friend like Janakibehnlibtech_262_footnotelibtech_263_footnotelibtech_264_footnotewho is ever ready to help me, I gave the blanket to her and told her how she could make it into a new one. The blanket is still with me. I deliberately took it with me, when I visited the Royal Palace in England.libtech_265_footnotelibtech_266_footnoteLet me explain, too, how the blanket was made new. It was sewn on to a piece of thick khadi, the whole surface being stitched both length-wise and breadth- wise. The wornout woollen blanket, being thus lined with khadi, become as good as new and gave more warmth than before. This does not mean that the effort which you are making for improving the quality of yarn is unnecessary. I daily realize the necessity of such effort. But such improvement will not reduce the importance of sewing for yajna or dispense with it. The love of khadi has still not spread widely in the country. It means, in other words, that love of the poor has not spread so, or, even where it exists, the people who have it
 
 
 are ignorant and are not yet convinced that the best way of showing their love is by patronizing khadi. If they can be convinced of this, your discovery can become very useful. I have not, therefore, become indifferent to it in the slightest degree. Do write a book on how to spin better yarn. But do not make a single statement in it the truth of which you have not tested. Nor should you deduce any general principle only on the basis of exclusively your experience. Others also must have found it true. If you have not checked all your statements in this manner, postpone writing the book. I observe again and again that books which have no basis in experience are practically without any value. For instance, if anybody translated Charakalibtech_267_footnotelibtech_268_footnote, the work would not be of any use today since we cannot find many of the herbs and plants described by him and, with regard to those which we do find, cannot prove the properties attributed to them. The most important thing therefore is that you yourself should spin the finest possible yarn of different counts and, while doing so, analyse and note the contribution of the spindle, the type of the spinning-wheel, the quality of the cotton used, the quality of the carding and your own, that is, the spinner’s skill towards the result. Then tally your experience with that of other spinners. A book based on such data will accepted without question, like a bar of gold weighed on the scale kept in the market for public use. You asked me what limit I have fixed with regard to the count of the yarn spun. Previously I had fixed it at 20, then raised it to 40. I do not lay down any limit now. If we can get or grow cotton from which we can spin yarn of 400 counts and which we can card well enough for such purpose, and if we can get men or women spinners who have sufficient patience to spin yarn of such quality, I would certainly desire that we should reach that level. In short, I think it very important that we should go in this direction as far as we can, for this is likely immediately to enhance the value of the art of hand- spinning. I am sure you know that a friend of Satis Babu had reached up to 150 counts. The khadi woven from it is preserved in Satis Babu’s collection. But along with this I also insist that as we progress in spinning yarn of finer and finer count the yarn should always be strong and even. I cannot say what marks any specimen of yarn should earn for passing the test in these respects. Only you and other experienced spinners can say that. I certainly have a rough test for this
 
 purpose, and it is that any weaver should be able to weave the yarn without difficulty. If a weaver rejects a lot, I would treat it as below par though it may have passed our test. When I get the cup, I will try the method suggested by you and test the strength of my yarn. Even without testing it, however, I know that it is not good enough, and I am myself not satisfied with it. Because of the pain in my elbow, I have had to change from one hand to the other [for drawing the yarn]. My hand had set very well on the Gandiva spinning-wheel and I could spin on it yarn of sufficiently uniform quality as I wished, though the speed was not much to speak of. But I was obliged to draw the thread with the right hand and then to spin on the Magan spinning-wheel, with the result that it is only now that I have acquired some control over it. As if this was not enough, I thought it my duty to use up the very inferior quality of slivers we had and I began spinning them. I have now resumed spinning with good slivers since a few days ago, and so, by the time your cup arrives and I try it, my yarn will have become good enough to pass the test. Previously I used to spin yarn of about 25 counts, but after I started spinning with the Magan wheel I remain at about 19 counts. Probably I will go up now. I think I have now answered all your questions. Have courage and cultivate strength of mind. Don’t think too much. How is Motibehnlibtech_269_footnotelibtech_270_footnote?
I have received the cup.

        BROTHER,    LETTER TO PARAMANAND      July 	6, 1932 
  	I have today learnt from a newspaper the news of your wife’s 	death. When you were imprisoned in the Andamans I had come to know 	her and was much impressed by her simplicity. May God grant you 	peace and patience.  Yours,  MOHANDAS 	GANDHI  Bombay 	Secret Abstracts, Home Department, Special Branch, File No. 800 (40) 	(3), Pt. II, p. 163      LETTER TO PARASRAM MEHROTRA    July 	6, 1932  CHI. 	PARASRAM,  	I have both your letters. Whenever there is doubt about the grammar 	of a Hindi word, is not consulting a dictionary the right course? 	One who knows Sanskrit will  commit  fewer  mistakes  in using his 	words. But a word used in Sanskrit in a particular sense would not, 	as a rule, be used in the same sense in Hindi. We should therefore 	regard the dictionary as an authority. And where the help of the 	dictionary is not available, we should regard one who knows Sanskrit 	as an authority. I looked up the word nirutsaha [wanting in 	enthusiasm] in the Hindi dictionary which is with me, and there also 	it is termed an adjective. Hence one who knows Sanskrit and the 	dictionary both agree about it. I write all this merely out the love 	of language. I expect a higher knowledge of the language from those 	who know a particular language. I also expect them to use it 	correctly. Hence I asked about the word  nirutsaha in   my  last  letterlibtech_271_footnotelibtech_272_footnote.  I  have always thought your knowledge of Hindi to be 	sound and I expect you to be more and more vigilant about it day by 	day. Someone must dedicate his life in the service of Hindi. 	Politics is always on our neck. But this cannot be nor should it be 	an exclusive field. We might have willingly or unwillingly plunged 	into it, but as soon as its activities calm down, we should return 	to our pursuit. Also not all of us need    
 plunge into politics at all times. Hence we should select, according to our capacity and inclination, any of the many permanent and constructive activitieslibtech_273_footnote. You certainly have a liking for Hindi. Now I would like you to think of dedicating your life for the spread of Hindi after adding to your knowledge of Hindi as much as you can. I do not mean to say that you should make this resolve soon. For the present you may carry on what you are doing. Most of your time is already taken up by Hindi. Whether you should stick to Hindi till the end of your life will become clear by itself in course of time. Just now I have simply sown the seed.
 Now about the Ramayana. What you write on this subject is true. I do not regard the  Ramayanas such as by Radhasoamilibtech_274_footnotelibtech_275_footnote, etc., to be refined works. The Ramayana of Tulsidas is a work of great refinement. We only have to create interest in it. We can surely bring out an abridged Ramayana in Tulsidas’s own language. I had made an attempt with regard to the ‘Balakanda’libtech_276_footnotelibtech_277_footnote. Most probably there is a copy in the Ashram. Twenty years have passed since then. If I were to take up the task again, perhaps I would choose entirely different quatrains and couplets from it. Prabhudas has also made an attempt in this direction. As you are engaged in teaching, it will be useful if you did something in this direction. Also you ought not to have much difficulty. Mahadev tells me that two or three such attempts have already been made in the U.P. But that need not deter you. There is no harm if a fourth is added to them. People of different tempera- ments, keeping in mind children or people of a different class, would make different sections. I will not insist  if  you  do  not  get  time during the evening prayer. The Hindi classes are always there. Try to create interest in the Ramayana whenever possible. Also if some wish to study the Ramayana out of devotion, and if you can spare time, you may arrange for such a class once or twice a week. But I do not at all insist on it. I am only expressing my desire. You alone can say how and to what extent it can be carried out.
 You must be perturbed, as I write all this. I think your work is going on well. Comparatively you were never more at ease than now and I do not at all wish to disturb you or make your mind unsteady
 
 by putting before you new ideas or schemes. These thoughts came to my mind on reading your letter and so I have placed them before you. Accept out of them whatever you can fully understand, digest and put them into execution, and forget the rest. Even if you discarded the whole lot, I would not be shocked.libtech_278_footnoteI  have  only  one mighty desire for you that you may feel yourself entirely at ease and may not be embarrassed at all.

   LETTER TO AN AMERICAN CORRESPONDENT  
 July 7, 1932
 DEAR FRIEND,
 I was touched by your letter. If you can possibly stand the climate of this country and the strenuous life of the Ashram, I would be delighted to have you as a member. There is no fee to be paid and you will not be called upon to pay for your board and lodging, so long as you can share the common meal. But the life is hard and incredibly simple. All the inmates are expected to labour in the field and the factory for a certain number of hours daily. All work, including scavenging, is done by the inmates. The dress we wear is
 
 also very simple and is all hand spun and hand-woven, and sewn at the Ashram. If, therefore, you feel inclined to venture out, whilst you are welcome, I would warn you against coming unless you have enough funds to take you back to America in the event of the climate or the institution not being agreeable to you. In spite of this letter [if] you desire to come to India and join the Ashram, I would like you to see Mr. Richard Gregg, who has lived at the Ashram for a long time and knows all about it, and you will not think of coming unless he gives you encouragement. His address is: Richard Hurst Hill, Esq., Spl. Asstt. to the President, Howard University, Washington, U.S.A.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I have not received any letter from you this week so far. I have 	read with great attention the bhajan and the ghazal which 	you sent to me. I liked both of them and fully understand them now. 	The bhajan is easy to understand, but there was some 	difficulty in understanding the ghazal as it contained new 	words. But I fully understood it after reading it over two or three 	times. The ghazal is very good indeed. I suppose “Zafar” 	is the nom de plume of Emperor Bahadur Shah, is it not? Send me more 	such ghazals from time to time. You wrote to me once that you 	would find out and send a suitable book for me. If you 
 have forgotten your promise, please remember it now and send a book if you find one. At present  I  am  reading  some  books published by the Jamia Millia. All of them are full of good thoughts. Two of the books were plays. The book I am reading at present contains stories like the “Kimiyagar” and others. Have you  seen these  books?  Convey  respectful  greetings  from  us  all  to  Father and Mother. As for you, a little squeezing of your ear on my behalf, which may be done by Kamal. I am waiting for  a  letter  from  Hamida. Uncle Sardar is still reading Amir Ali’s book. The rains have now set in here. Cultivators were worrying. The weather has become now fairly cool. I hope Pashabhai’s sister is all right now.libtech_280_footnote
 You should correct in the foregoing not only spelling mistakes but grammar  mistakes  also.  The  Urdu  book  which  you  send  to  me will be more useful if it also contains a glossary of  ordinary words, rules of  grammar  and  spelling,  etc.  If  there  is  no  such  book you need not trouble yourself.

  	Our letter to  hand.  I  have  carefully  gone  through  it.  It  is 	 not proper that  you  should  compete  with  Prabhudas. It  is  	likely that Prabhudas’s expenses might be less as he gets some 	other conveniences. Some estimate can be arrived at from the 	expenses incurred by Prahbudas. But, as a matter of fact, the 	unavoidable expenses only are to be taken into account. A big amount 	was to be spent for Rasik all of a sudden. Maganlal fell ill and 	died at such a place in Patna that no expenses were incurred. One 	time, Krishnadas did not incur any expense. But when he was removed 	to Dehradun, the expenses rose at once. Hence, ultimately every case 	is to be separa- tely considered. We can only desire and demand from 	them that they should spend money thoughtfully and keep an account 	of the money spent. The Ashram can spend so far as it can afford to 	do it. When the Ashram cannot afford, we should all assemble in the 	Ashram and suffer the consequences and while so doing should laugh 	and enjoy the pleasure. I have suggested this to Narandas also.

   LETTER TO ASHRAM BOYS AND GIRLS  
 July 8, 1932
 DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS,
 It is certainly good that those who feel sleepy during the prayers keep standing. One reason why the feet of those who stand up ache is that they do not know how to stand. Anybody who keeps his feet on the ground thus, A, and who stands erect can stand for a long time without getting tired. One who is not accustomed to standing will certainly feel tired for a day or two. But afterwards he will not feel tired. We should show love for those who  follow  the  wrong  path, and serve them, but we ourselves should follow the right path. If we do this, in time the other person will come to the right path. One who cultivates devotion to God, whether he is working or resting, teaches devotion to others too. Following the path of truth in life helps us in every way.
 Your questions seem to have been  asked  for  the  sake  of  asking them.

  	In ‘God is Truth’, ‘is’  certainly  does  not  mean  ‘equal 	 to’  nor does it merely mean ‘is truthful’. Truth is not a 	mere attribute of God but He is That. He is nothing if He is not 	That. Truth in Sanskrit  means  Sat.  Sat  means  ‘Is’.  	Therefore  Truth  is  implied   in ‘Is’. God  is,  nothing  else 	 is.  Therefore  the  more  truthful  we are, the nearer we are to 	God. We are only to the extent that we are truthful.  	The illustration of hen and her chickens is good. But better still 	is that of the Lord and His serf. The latter is far from the former 	because both are mentally so far apart thought physically so near.

  	I also did not feel happy about the first stanzalibtech_293_footnotelibtech_294_footnotein 	 our  prayer. But  on  thinking  more  deeply  about  it,  I   	realized   that   reciting   it  daily with  proper  understanding  	of  its  meaning   was useful. Our reason certainly tells us that we 	are not this physical body, but are the witness who dwells in it. 	The stanza describes this witness, and then the seeker asserts that 	he is that witness—the Brahman. Only those who daily strive to 	become that and loosen the bond of their physical  bodies  can  make 	such an  assertion.  Whenever  one realizes that one has forgotten 	one’s real nature or is overcome with fear or with the dualities 	of love and hatred, pleasure and pain, etc., one should remember the 	qualities of the  Brahman  and  try  to become free from the 	dualities. By so doing, one becomes that on which one  daily  	meditates.  We  may,  therefore,daily  recite  that stanza with 	humility and firm aspiration and keep in mind our assertion in all 	our actions.

          DEAR 	NIMU,    LETTER TO NIRMALABEHN GANDHI    July 	9, 1932 
  	I read your letter to Ramdas. What a fool you are! You do not write 	to me, nor speak to Narandas about your difficulties and write about 	them to poor Ramdas! Was it for this that I got you married to 	Ramdas? Moreover, the teaching in the Ashram is to the effect that a 	woman should not believe herself to be dependent, weak, should not 	go on looking to her husband, but should make her own way (in life). 	Take the instance of Gangadevi. When Totaramji became a pauper, it 	was Gangadevi who kept up his spirit. Your difficulty is nothing. If 	there is any need for a boy, Narandas will get one. You should place 	all your difficulties before Narandas as if he were your father. You 	certainly have confidence in him. This much is my advice. Do not 	engage a boy for doing Ashram work. Taking proper care of children I 	consider to be the work of the Ashram. The responsibility to taking 	care of children lies with the Ashram. You are doing your duty on 	behalf of the Ashram. Hence, believe that you have given all the 	hours to the Ashram. In spite of this, if you require a boy, it is a 	different matter. You write to me properly. Otherwise I will have to 	bring you round.  BAPU  Bombay 	Secret Abstracts, Home Department, Special Branch, File No. 800 (40) 	(3), Pt. II, p. 205

 dependent. She would find her way out. She would not sit (idly) look- ing at the face of her husband. What a (good) example Gangadevi had set! Totaramji became a pauper; she kept up his spirits and did not allow his beggarliness to be felt at all. If she does not write to me here- after she will have to be brought round. I have written to her to this effect. I have expresed my opinion that she should not engage a boy servant to do the Ashram work. A mother who takes proper care of her children is also doing the Ashram work, becaues so long as Nimu is in the Ashram the responsibility of taking care of the children rests with the Ashram, i.e., Nimu by taking care of the children discharges her duty to the Ashram and so it is equivalent to doing Ashram work. You need not be anxious over it. You have done right in throwing that anxiety on me. At present my letters are being checked. There is no reason why they should do so. But are we not prisoners?  Hence perhaps why letter may reach the Ashram late. Even in that case there is no cause for anxiety. Your weight must increase. The doctor says that Ramdas can ask for and eat whetever he likes. If milk is necessary,  it should be taken. You should not allow the body to become weak. I know your nature. I am also of the same views. But I would not hesitate to take those things which my other companions do not get if I am convinced that my health requires them. It is a different matter if we know that the other companions also need them.
 As regards the health of Surendra, some thought has  to  be  given. Does he take wheat at present? His weight must increase. If the energy is maintained there is no reason to add to the weight.
 I have sent a Parsi book for Mr. Darbari. I have not paid for it. He may return it when he has done with it. It is a very good book. It contains a full substance of the Zoroastrian ethics. Now Mr. Darbari must be completely recovered.
 Devdas is completely recovered. There is nothing settled about (his) transfer. It seems other (prisoners) are where they were lodged.
 Prof. Trivedi has sent (me) the writings of (Swami)Viveka-  nanda. I did not  send  for  them.  If  anyone  from  your  side  has  sent for the same please let me know so that I may send the same to him.

 We have not received any new books worth reading. Chandulal has sent me the Gondal Reading Series.
 If Ramdas has occasion to write to Nimu, he may write a brief purport of what I have written above. So that she may know my views even if my letter reaches her late, or does not reach her at all.

 counts, it is done up. But there is a great difference between yarn of 15 and 30 counts. Do you say that there is no difficulty in spinning yarn up to 30 counts? If you say that, what is the speed for spinning yarn of 30 counts? What is the waste in spinning a tola of yarn? What is the speed for spinning yarn of 40 counts? What is the waste after it? What is the reason that there is difficulty in spinning yarn of finer counts? Prabhudas has much faith in you. If you want to fulfil his hopes, you should be engrossed in the spinning-wheel and find out its faults if there be any, and should find out its measure of strengh. By spinning on one spindle only, perhaps, yarn of finer quality might be obtained. Also find out whether you can obtain as much yarn upon a spindle by the Magan spinning-wheel, as you would get on a spindle by an ordinary spinning-wheel.
 Many Muslims believe in rebirth. There is a great difference between one who tells a falsehood once and one who has formed a habit of telling lies.

   EDUCATIONlibtech_301_footnote  
 July 10, 1932
 I will explain in brief one central idea about education which has been dominating my thoughts as I am writing the history of the Ashram. Some persons see a deficiency in the Ashram,  namely, absence of any arrangement for education, that is, for literary education. I also can see this deficiency. But it will probably remain as long as the Ashram lasts. I will not here go into the reasons for that.
 People see this deficiency because we do not know the true meaning of education and the right method of acquiring it, or we assume that the existing system of imparting education is the right one. According to me, the present idea of education and the method of imparting and receiving it are both faulty.
 True education is that which helps us to know the atman, our true self, God and Truth. To acquire this knowledge, some persons may feel the need for a study of literature, some for a study of  physical sciences and some others for art. But every branch of knowledge should have as its goal knowledge of the self. That is so in the Ashram. We carry on numerous activities with that aim in view. All of them are, in my sense of the term, true education. Those activities can also be carried on without any reference to the goal of knowledge of the self. When they are so carried on, they may serve as a means of livelihood or of something else, but they are not education. In an activity carried on as education, a proper understanding of its  meaning, devotion to duty and the spirit of service are necessary. The first necessarily brings about development of the intellect. In doing any piece of work, however small, we should be inspired by a holy aim and, while doing it, we should try to understand the purpose which it will serve and the scientific method of doing it. There is a science of every type of work—whether it be cooking, sanitation, carpentry or spinning. Everybody who does his work with the attitude of a student knows its science or discovers it.
 If the inmates of the Ashram understand this, they would see that the Ashram is a great school in which the inmates receive
 
 
 education not for a few hours only but all the time. Every person who lives in the Ashram to attain knowledge of the self—of Truth—is both a teacher and a pupil. He is a teacher in regard to what he knows, and a pupil in regard to anything about which he needs to learn. If we know more than our neighbour about anything, we should willingly share our knowledge with him, and equally willingly receive from him what he knows more than we do. If we thus regularly exchange knowledge with others, we would not feel the absence of teachers, and education would become a painless and spontaneous process. The most important education is the training of character. As we advance in our observance of yamaniyamas, our capacity for learning—for knowing Truth—will go on increasing.
 What about literary education, then? It is no more a question. The rule for this is the same as for the other activities. The method explained above dispenses with one superstition, namely, that for education we require a separate building known as school and a  teacher to teach. When the desire for literary education awakens in us, we should know that we shall have to acquire it through self-help. There is ample scope for this in the Ashram. If I have been able to explain above my idea clearly, literary education should no more be a problem. Those who possess it should take every  opportunity  to impart it to others and the latter should receive it from them.

   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI  
 July 6/10, 1932
 
CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got your letter and the other mail. These day I get them very regularly. I had handed over my packet on Monday for being posted and I do not understand why you did not get it till Saturday. In future, you should inspect the postmark on every packet. It is difficult to understand how a letter posted by you there reaches me the next day but what I send from here reaches you after six days.
 You need not send me just now the register of hours of work. It will be quite enough it you send it whenever you observe anything special in the figures, or at the most once a month. Among other things, I am sure of this, that when the whole thing has become systematic everybody will do his or her work sincerely and then
 nobody will feel any burden. If anybody feels a little worried in hismind, that also will and must disappear. For a sincere person one thing should be enough. Nobody should undertake more than what he can cope with and should wish to do less than what he can. He who attempts to do more than what he is capable of suffers from pride, he is attached to work and its fruit. He who does less than what he can is a thief. By maintaining a register of the hours of work, we can save ourselves from either mistake, may be without knowing it. I don’t say that we shall positively save ourselves, for, if we do not help to keep the register willingly and with full appreciation of its need, we cannot derive the fullest benefit from it.
 Did you carefully read Sitala Sahay’s letter? I saw nothing objectionable in it. I see no anger in it. If what he writes about Prabhudas  is  correct,  his  demand  is  not unreasonable.   But   we can decide this justly only in the manner I have explained, that is, by examining his expenses. In such matters, examples of others give us no help. They may serve as a guide, but, when a person gives us an account of his expenses and we can find no fault with it, we must pay him what the account justifies. It is quite possible that such precedents may cause difficulties in future. But we may hope that, since our motives are sincere, we shall escape such difficulties.
 He who has protected us up to now will protect us even in future. We shall go on paying as long as we have money. If we have brought His name into disrepute, He will deprive us even of what we have. Whom will we pay then? Sitala Sahay says in his letter that Padma has sent some accounts to you. I suppose they are all right, are they? I also assume that what Sitala Sahay writes about Prabhudas’s expenses is correct. If, however, the facts are not as stated by him, it would certainly be necessary to think more about the matter. My opinion, thus, is based on the assumption that the information given by Sitala Sahay in his letter is correct. You do perfectly right in putting all the facts of a case before me. I should go on giving my opinions as long as I can, so that your burden may be lighter.
 Nimu has written a letter to Ramdas which he has sent to me. She writes in  it  about  having  engaged  a  boy.  She  believes  that  she needs his help, but suspects that you may not have approved of her action. She also says that you have raised no objection Ramdas has left it to me to do what I think proper. I cannot decide in this
 matter independently. I am writing a letterlibtech_302_footnotelibtech_303_footnoteto Nimu.
 Read it and do what you think best. Don’t wait for Nimu to speak to you, but go and meet her yourself and put her mind at rest.
 If you can, do save Shashi, If necessary, you may speak firmly to Ratilal about him.

 My writing letters has become a serious issue and  I  do  not know when, if at all, you got the last packet of my letters. Nor do I know when you will get this. I have sought clarification about this matter.libtech_304_footnoteI cannot say what the outcome will be. “Neither be glad to get what is pleasant, nor be sad to get what is unpleasant”.libtech_305_footnote
 Today’s articlelibtech_306_footnoteis about education. Read it carefully and think over it. If you understand it properly, you will have to shoulder one more burden, a mental one this time. Examine carefully every person in your mind, and consider whether all of them fully understand the work which they do. Understand and explain to others the meaning and method of every activity in the Ashram. If there is any point which you do not understand ask me. If you question me about anything which I understand, I will answer your question. Find out whether everybody gets time to read. You will require some peace of mind to be able to take up this responsibility. As it is, you have been all the time doing a teacher’s work, and so this work will not be new for you. I have only widened your sphere. However, my method of teaching is simple. It requires little memorizing to be done. Our activities concern rural life, and their science, therefore, is not beyond our capacity. As for literature and similar studies, everybody may get from the books in the library as much as he can and impart it to the others. The important thing is development of intellect and understa- nding the meaning of our quest of truth. If that is understood, the rest will follow. Our contentment then will be boundless. We shall have to make no effort to learn patience. We shall have secured the key to all knowledge. We shall wish to know only as much as is necessary for our spiritual progress and for self-realization.

  	I forgot to write about one thing in my letterlibtech_307_footnoteto you last week, namely, about the time spent in 	prayers. One should not grudge it or feel bored. Islam enjoins 	prayers five times a day, and every prayer lasts for not less than 	15 minutes and the substance every time is the same. In Christian 	prayers, one feature is constant, and that also generally takes 15 	minutes every time. In the Roman Catholic Church and the Established 	Church of England no prayer lasts for less than half an hour, and 	the prayers are held in the morning, in the evening and at noon. 	Pious men and women do not feel this irksome. In short, none of us 	has a right to change the established pattern of daily activities in 	the Ashram, for all of us are imperfect and we have discussed these 	things long enough. We should now learn to take interest in our 	activities. We wish to realize God through them and derive our daily 	sustenance from them. Instead of thinking about making changes in 	our programme, we should carry it out as best as we can and instil 	life in our activities. This is how I feel as I think more and more 	about the matter.  BAPU  From a photostat of the Gujarati: C.W. 229. Courtesy: Lakshmibehn N.

   HISTORY OF THE SATYAGRAHA ASHRAMlibtech_311_footnote  
 [July 11, 1932]
 INTRODUCTION
 Ashram here means a community of men of religion. Looking at the past in the light of the present, I feel that an ashram was a necessary of life for me. As soon as I had a house of my own, my house was an ashram in this sense, for my life as a householder was not one of enjoyment but of duty discharged from day to day. Again, besides the members of  my  family  I   always  had   some  friends  or
 
 translated into English by Valji G. Desai and published by the Navajivan Publishing House under the title Ashram Observances in Action in 1955. The translator has occasionally changed the paragraphing, omitted a sentence or summarized an argument, but otherwise the translation is faithful and is reproduced here. Two paragraphs of the incomplete chapter on satyagraha, which were written on July 11, 1932 and which were omitted in the English version, have been translated from the Gujarati. Appendices found in Gujarati and English versions are not reproduced here, since they are placed in their chronological order under the dates February 16, 1916,
 June 14, 1928 and December 8, 1941. For the first two appendices, vide “Speech on
 Ashram Vows at Y. M. C. A., Madras”, 16-2-1916 and “Satyagraha ashram”, 14-6- 1928.
 
 others living with me, whose relation with me was spiritual from the first or became such later on. This went on unconsciously till 1904 when I read Ruskin’s Unto This Last,libtech_312_footnotewhich made a deep impression on me. I determined to take Indian Opinion into a forest where I should live with the workers as members of my family. I purchased 100 acres of land and founded Phoenix Settlement, which neither we nor anyone else called an ashram. It had a religious basis, but the visible object was purity of body and mind as well as economic equality. I did not then consider brahmacharya (chastity) to be essential; on the other hand it was expected that co-workers would live as family men and have children. A brief account of Phoenix will be found in Satyagraha in South Africa.
This was the first step.
 The second step was taken in 1906. I learnt in the school of experience that brahmacharya was a sine qua non for a life devoted to service. From this time onward I looked upon Phoenix deliberately as a religious institution. The same year witnessed the advent of satyagraha which was based on religion and implied an unshakable faith in the God of Truth. Religion here should not be understood in a narrow sense, but as that which acts as a link between different  religions and realizes their essential unity.
 This went on till 1911. All these years the Phoenix Settlement was progressing as an ashram though we did not call it by that name.
 We took the third step in 1911. So far only those people lived at Phoenix who were working in the press and the paper. But now as a part of the satyagraha movement we felt the need of an ashram where satyagrahi families could live and lead a religious life. I had already come in contact with my German friend Kallenbach. Both of us were living a sort of ashram life. I was a barrister and Kallenbach an architect. However we led a comparatively very simple life in the sparsely populated country, and were religiously minded. We might commit mistakes out of ignorance, but we were trying to seek the root of every activity in religion. Kallenbach purchased a farm of 1,100 acres and the satyagrahi families settled there. Religious problems confronted us now at every step and the whole  institution  was  managed from a religious standpoint. Among the settlers there were Hindus, Mussalmans, Christians and Parsis. But I do not remember
 
 that they ever quarrelled with one another, though each was staunch in his own faith. We respected one another’s religion and tried to help everybody to follow his own faith and thus to make spiritual progress.
 This institution was not known as Satyagraha Ashram but as Tolstoy Farm. Kallenbach and I were followers of Tolstoy and endeavoured to practise much of his doctrine. Tolstoy Farm was closed in 1912 and the farmers were sent to Phoenix. The history of Tolstoy Farm will also be found in Satyagraha in South Africa.libtech_313_footnote
 Phoenix now was no longer meant for the workers of Indian Opinion only; it was a satyagraha institution. That was only to be expected, for Indian Opinion owed its very existence to satyagraha. Still it was a great change. The even tenor of the lives of the settlers at Phoenix was disturbed, and they had now to discern certainty in the midst of uncertainty like the satyagrahis. But they were equal to the new demands made upon them. As at Tolstoy Farm, so  also  at Phoenix I established a common kitchen which some joined while others had private kitchens of their own. The congregational prayer in the evening played a large part in our lives. And the final satyagraha campaign was started by the inmates of Phoenix Settlement in 1913.libtech_314_footnoteThe struggle ended in 1914.libtech_315_footnotelibtech_316_footnoteI left South Africa in July that year. It was decided that all settlers who wanted to go to India should be enabled to go there. Before going to India I had to meet Gokhale in England. The idea was to found a new institution in India for those who went there from Phoenix. And the community life commenced in South Africa was to be continued in India. I reached India early in 1915libtech_317_footnotelibtech_318_footnotewith a view to establish an ashram though I was still unaware that I would call it by that name.
 I toured all parts of India for a year, and visited some institutionslibtech_319_footnotelibtech_320_footnotefrom which I had much to learn. I was invited by several cities to establish the ashram in their neighbourhood with a promise of assistance  in  various  ways.   Ahmedabad   was   selected   at   last. This  was  the  fourth, and  I  imagine   the   last   step.   Whether   or not it will always be the last is something of which no forecast is
 
 possible.libtech_321_footnoteHow was the new institution to be named? What should be its rules and regulations? On these points I had full discussions and correspondence with friends, as a result of which we decided to call the institution Satyagraha Ashram. It is an appropriate name if we take its object into consideration. My life is devoted to the quest of truth. I would live and, if need be, die in prosecuting it, and of course I would take with me as many fellow-pilgrims as I could get.
 The Ashram  was  established  in  a  rented  house  at  Kochrab on May 25, 1915. Some citizens of Ahmedabad undertook to finance it. At the beginning there were about 20libtech_322_footnotelibtech_323_footnoteinmates, most of them from South Africa. Of these again the large majority spoke Tamil or Tel- ugu. The chief activity in the Ashram at this time was teaching Sanskrit, Hindi and Tamil to the old as well as the young, who also received some general education. Hand- weaving was the principal industry with some carpentry as accessory to it. No servants were engaged; therefore cooking, sanitation, fetching water—everything was attended to by the Ashramites. Truth and other observ- ances were obligatory on them  all.libtech_324_footnotelibtech_325_footnoteDistinctions  of  caste  were  not observed. Untouchability  had  not  only  no  place  in  the  Ashram,  but its eradication from Hindu society was one of our principal objectives. Emancipation of women from some customary bonds was insisted upon  from  the  first.  Therefore  women  in  the  Ashram enjoy full freedom. Then again it was an Ashram rule that persons following a particular faith should have the same feeling for followers of other faiths as for their co-religionists.
 But for one thing I was solely responsible, and I am indebted to the West for it. I refer to my dietetic experiments, which commenced in 1888 when I went to England for studies. I always invite members of my family and other co-workers to join in. The experiments were designed to achieve three objects, viz., (1) to acquire control over the palate as a part of self-control in general; (2) to find out which diet was the simplest and the cheapest so that by adopting it we might
 
 identify ourselves with the poor; and (3) to discover which diet was necessary for perfect health, as maintenance of health is largely dependent upon correct diet.
 If in England I had not been under a  vow to be a  vegetarian,  I might perhaps never have undertaken experiments in diet. But once I began to experiment, these three objectives took me into deeper waters, and I was led to make various kinds of experiments. And the Ashram too joined in, though these experiments were not a part of Ashram discipline.
 The reader has perhaps now seen that the Ashram set out to remedy what it thought were defects in our national life from the religious, economic and political standpoints. As we gathered new experiences we undertook fresh activities. Even now I cannot say that the Ashram has embarked on all possible activities that I can think of. There have been two limitations. First, we were sure we must cut our coat according to our cloth, that is, we must manage with what funds were placed at our disposal by friends without any special effort in collection. Secondly we should not go in search of new spheres of activity, but if any activity naturally suggested itself to our minds, we should go in for it without counting the cost.
 These two limitations spring from a religious attitude. This implies faith in God, that is, doing everything in dependence upon and under the inspiration of God. The main of religion conducts such activities as are sent by God with such resources as God places at his disposal. He never lets us see that He Himself does anything; He achieves His aims through men inspired by Him. When help was received from unexpected quarters or from friends without our asking for it, my faith led me to believe that it was sent by God. Similarly when some activity came to us unsought so that not to take it up would have been sheer cowardice, laziness or the like, I thought it was a godsend.
 The same principle applies to co-workers as to material resources and to activities. We may have the funds and know how they are to be used, but we can do nothing in the absence of co-workers. Co-workers also should come unsought. We did not merely imagine but had a living faith that the Ashram was God’s. If therefore He wished to make the Ashram His instrument as regards any activity, it was for Him to place the requisite men and munitions at the Ashram’s disposal. Phœnix, Tolstoy Farm and Sabarmati Ashram have all been
 conducted more or less according to these principles consciously or unconsciously. Ashram rules were observed at first with some laxity, but the observance has become stricter from day to day.
 The Ashram population doubled itself in a few months. Again the Kochrab bungalow was a hardly suitable building for an ashram. It would do for one well-to-do family, but not for sixty men, women and children engaged in various activities and observing brahmacharya and other vows. However we had to manage with what building was available. But very soon it became impossible to live in it for a number of reasons. As if God wanted to drive us out of it, we had suddenly to go out in search of a new site and to vacate the bungalow.   The   curious   will  look   up   the   Autobiographylibtech_326_footnotefor   an account of these events. There was one defect in the Ashram at Kochrab which was remedied after we had removed to Sabarmati. An Ashram without orchard, farm or cattle would not be a complete unit. At Sabarmati we had cultivable land and therefore went in for agriculture at once.
 Such is the prehistory and history of the Ashram. I now propose to deal with its observances and activities in so far as I remember them. My diary is not at hand. Even if it is, it takes no note of the personal history of the Ashramites. I therefore depend upon memory alone. This is nothing new for me, as Satyagraha in South Africa and the Autobiography were written in the same manner. The reader will please bear this limitation in mind, as he goes through these pages.
 I     TRUTH
 Whenever someone was found telling a lie in the Ashram, effective steps were taken to deal with the situation as symptomatic of a serious disease. The Ashram does not believe in punishing wrongdoers, so much so that hesitation is felt even in asking them to leave the institution. Three lines of preventive action were therefore adopted.
 The first thing attended to was the purity of the principal workers in charge, the idea being that if they were free from fault, the atmosphere about them was bound to be affected by their innocence. Untruth cannot stand before truth like darkness before the light of the sun.
 
 Secondly, we had recourse to confession. If someone was found practising untruth, the fact was brought to the notice of the congrega- tion. This is a very useful measure if it is judiciously adopted. But one has to be careful about two things. The public confession must not be tainted by even a trace of force; and the confession should not lead to the person confessing taking leave of all sense of shame. If he comes to believe that mere confession has washed off his sin, he is no longer ashamed of it at all. There should be an ever present consciousness of the fact that the least little untruth is a dangerous thing.
 Thirdly, the worker in charge of the Ashram as well as the wrongdoer would fast as a matter of penance. Of course it is a matter for the wrongdoer himself to decide whether or not he should undertake a fast. But as for the worker in charge, he is clearly responsible for intentional and unintentional wrongdoing in his institution. Untruth is more poisonous and more subtle than any poison gas whatever, but it dare not enter where the head of the institution is wide awake and has a spiritual outlook on life. Still if it is found to have effected an entrance, it is a warning to the principal worker, who may be sure that he must bear his share of responsibility for this infection. I for one believe that spiritual acts have clearly defined results precisely like combinations or processes in the natural sciences. Only as we have no such means of measurement in the former case as in the latter, we are not ready to believe or we only half-heartedly believe in the spiritual influences. Again,  we  are inclined to be lenient to ourselves with the result that our experiments are unsuccessful and we tend to move only in a circle like the oil- miller’s bullock. Thus untruth gets a long lease of life, and at last we reach the melancholy conclusion that it is unavoidable. And what is unavoidable easily becomes necessary, so that not truth but untruth increases its own prestige.
 When therefore untruth was discovered in the Ashram, I readily pleaded guilty for it myself. That is to say, I have not still attained truth as defined by me. It may be due to ignorance, but it is clear that  I have not fully understood truth and therefore neither even thought it out nor declared it, still less practised it. But granting all this, was I to leave the Ashram, and resort to some Himalayan cave and impose silence upon myself? That would be sheer cowardice. The quest of truth cannot be prosecuted in a cave. Silence makes no sense where it is necessary to speak. One may live in a cave in certain circumstances, but the common man can be tested only in society.
 What then is the remedy  to  be  tried  to  get  rid  of  untruth? The only answer which suggests itself to me is bodily penance, that is fasting and  the  like.  Bodily  penance  has  a  threefold  influence,  first over the penitent, secondly over the wrongdoer and thirdly over the congregation. The penitent becomes more alert, examines the innermost recesses of his  own  heart  and  takes  steps  to  deal  with any  personal  weakness  that  he  may  discover.  If  the   wrongdoer has any pity, he becomes conscious of his own fault, is ashamed of it and resolves never to sin any more in the future. The congregation takes a course of self-introspection.
 But bodily penance is only a means to an end, not an end in itself. By itself it cannot bring an erring person to the right path. It is profitable only if it is accompanied by a certain line of thinking, which is as follows:
 Man tends to become a slave of his own  body,  and  engages in many activities and commits many sins for the sake of physical enjoyment. He should  therefore  mortify  the  flesh  whenever  there  is an occasion of sin. A man given to physical enjoyment is subject to delusion. Even a slight renunciation of  enjoyment  in  the  shape of food will probably be helpful in breaking the power of that delusion. Fasting in order to produce this effect must be taken in its widest sense as the exercise of control over all the organs of sense with a view to the purification of oneself or others. Merely  giving  up food does not amount to a fast. And fasting for health is  no  fasting at all in this sense.
 I have also found that frequent fasting tends to rob it of its efficacy, for then it becomes almost a mechanical process  without  any background  of thought. Every fast therefore should be  undertaken after due deliberation.
 I have noted one special effect of fasting in my own case. I have fasted frequently; therefore my co-workers are nervous and are afraid that a fresh fast may place my life in danger. This fear makes them observe certain rules. I consider this an undesirable consequence of fasting. I do not however think that self-control practised on account of such fear does any harm. This fear is inspired by love,  and therefore it is a good thing if a person steers clear of wrongdoing even under the influence of such fear. Deliberate and voluntary reformation is of course very desirable, but it is only to be welcomed if a person avoids sin because he is afraid of causing pain to elders, as
 it involves no use of brute force. There are many cases of reformation undertaken primarily only to please one’s dear ones becoming a permanent feature of men’s lives.
 One painful consequence of fasting must be taken into account. People sometimes do not avoid sin but only try to hide it for fear that someone else may fast if he comes to know of it.
 I hold that penance is necessary in certain cases and it has benefited the Ashram on the whole. But one who undertakes it must possess certain qualifications :
  The 	wrongdoer should have 	love for the 	penitent. The 	penitent may 	have love for 	the wrongdoer; but 	if the 	wrongdoer is 	unaware of 	it or 	adopts an inimical 	attitude towards the penitent, penance 	for him is 	out of 	the question. 	As he regards 	himself as an 	enemy of 	the penitent, he hates 	the latter. There is 	therefore  a 	possibility of the 	fast affecting him in 	a manner contrary 	to all expectations, 	or acting 	as brute 	force employed against 	him and thus 	regarded by 	him as 	a form 	of coercion. 	Moreover, if everyone 	is supposed 	to be entitled 	to undertake 	penance for the failings 	of others 	who do 	not stand 	in a special 	relation to him, 	there would be no end 	to the  programme 	 of 	  penance.   Penance 	  for   the 	  sins   of   the 	whole world might befit 	a mahatma 	(great soul), but 	here we are concerned 	with the common man.  The 	penitent himself must 	be one 	of the 	parties wronged. 	That is 	to say, one 	should not 	do penance 	for a 	failing with 	which he 	is not in 	any way concerned. 	Thus, suppose A and 	B are 	friends. B 	is a 	member of 	the Ashram, 	but A 	has nothing 	to do with 	it. B 	has wronged 	the Ashram. 	Here A 	has neither 	the duty 	nor the right 	to undertake  a 	  penance   for   B’s 	  fault.   His 	  interference   might 	even complicate 	the situation 	both for the Ashram 	and B. 	He may not 	even possess the 	necessary  material 	 to  pronounce  a 	 judgment  on 	B’s  conduct.  By 	 agreeing  to 	 B’s  admission  to 	 the  Ashram,  A must be 	regarded as 	having transferred 	to the 	Ashram his 	respons- ibility 	for B’s good conduct.  A 	penitent for 	another’s wrongdoing 	must himself 	be guiltless 	of similar 	misconduct. “The 	pot may 	not call 	the kettle black”.  The 	 penitent  must  	otherwise  also  be  a  man 	 of   purity 	and appear 	such to 	the wrongdoer. 	Penance for 	another’s wrong- 	doing presupposes 	purity; and if 	the guilty man 	has no respect 
 
 for the penitent, the latter’s fast  might  easily  have  an  unhealthy effect upon him.
  The penitent must  not have  any 	 personal  interest 	 to serve. Thus, if 	A has 	promised to 	pay B 	ten rupees, 	non-payment of it 	is a fault. 	But B may 	 not  perform 	 penance  for  A’s  	failure  to 	redeem his promise.  The 	penitent must 	not have 	any anger 	in him. 	If a father 	commences a 	fast in anger for a 	 fault  of his  son,  that  is  not 	penance. There should be 	nothing but 	compassion in 	penance, the 	object being the purification of oneself as well as of the guilty person.  The 	wrong act 	must be 	patent, accepted as 	such by 	all and 	spiritually harmful, 	 and  the 	 doer  must 	 be  aware  of  its 	 nature. There should be 	no penance for 	inferential guilt, 	as it might 	at times 	have dangerous 	 consequences. There  should  be 	 no  room 	  for doubt 	as regards 	the fault. 	Moreover, one 	should not 	do penance 	for an 	act which he  alone  	regards  as  wrong. 	 It  is  possible  that  	what one holds 	to be wrong 	today he might 	regard as innocent 	tomorrow. So 	the  wrong  must 	 be  one  that 	 is  accepted  as 	 such  by 	 society.  For 	instance, I 	might regard the 	non-wearing of 	khadi to 	be very wrong. But 	my co-worker 	might see nothing 	wrong in it, 	or might 	not attach 	much importance 	to it, 	and so might 	or might 	not wear it 	as he wishes. 	If I 	regard this as 	a wrong 	and fast 	for it, that 	is not 	penance but 	coercion. There 	can be 	no penance also where 	the wrongdoer 	is not 	conscious of 	having done 	anything wrong. 
 The discussion of this topic is necessary for an institution in which there is no place for punishment or which always strives to act in a religious spirit. In such institutions the penance on the part of the heads of the Ashram takes the place of penal measures. It would be impossible to maintain its purity in any other way. Punishment and disciplinary action might make for an outer show of orderliness and progress, but that is all. On the other hand penance preserves the institution both internally and externally and makes the institution firmer day by day. Hence the necessity for some such rules as those given above.
 Fasts and such other penance have been undertaken in the Ashram. Still it is far, far indeed, from its ideal of truth, and therefore, as we shall see later on, we now call it by the name of Udyoga Mandir (Temple of Industry). But we can certainly say that the men in charge of the Ashram are wide awake, fully conscious of their imperfections
 and constantly trying to make sure that untruth does not find a foothold anywhere. But in an institution to which new members are being admitted from time to time, and that too only on trust, and which is frequented by men from all provinces of India and some foreign countries, it is no easy thing to keep all of them on the strait and narrow path. But if only the men at the top are true to themselves, the Ashram is sure to stand the test, no matter how hard it is. There is no limit to the potency of truth, as there is a limit to the power of an individual seeker. But if he is wide awake and is striving constantly, there is no limit to his power as well.
 II     PRAYER

 If insistence on truth  constitutes  the  root  of  the  Ashram, prayer is the principal feeder of that root. The social (as distinguished from  the  individual)  activities  of  the  Ashram commence   every day with the congregational morning worship at 4.15 to 4.45 a.m. and close  with  the  evening  prayer   at   7   to   7.30  p.m.   Ever   since the Ashram was founded, not a single day has passed to  my  knowledge without this worship. I know of several occasions when owing to the rains only one responsible person was present on the prayer ground. All inmates are expected to attend the worship except in the case of illness  or similar  compelling  reason  for  absence.  This expectation has been fairly well fulfilled at the evening prayer, but not in the morning.
 The time for morning worship was as a matter of experiment fixed at 4, 5, 6 and 7 a.m., one after another.  But  on  account  of  my persistently strong attitude on the subject, it has been fixed at  last at 4.20 a.m. With the first bell at 4 everyone rises from bed and after a wash reaches the prayer ground by 4.20.
 I believe that in a country like India the sooner a man rises from  bed  the  better.  Indeed  millions  must  necessarily  rise   early. If the peasant is  a  late  riser,  his  crops  will  suffer  damage.  Cattle are attended to and cows are milked early  in  the  morning.  Such being the case, seekers of saving truth, servants of  the  people  or monks may well be up  at  2  or  3;  it  would  be  surprising  if  they are not. In all countries  of  the  world  devotees  of  God  and  tillers of the soil rise early. Devotees take the name of God and peasants work in their fields serving the world as well as themselves. To my
 
 mind both are worshippers. Devotees are deliberately such while cultivators  by  their  industry  worship  God   unawares,   as   it   helps to sustain the world. If instead of working in the fields, they took to
 religious meditation, they would be failing in their duty and involving themselves and the world in ruin.
 We may or may not look upon the cultivator as a devotee, but where peasants, labourers and other people have willy nilly to rise early, how can a worshipper of Truth or servant of the people be a late riser? Again in the Ashram we are trying to co-ordinate work and worship. Therefore I am definitely of opinion that all able-bodied people in the Ashram must rise early even at the cost of inconvenience. Four a.m. is not early but the latest time when we must be up and doing.
 Then again we had to take a decision on certain  questions. Where should the prayers be offered? Should we erect a temple  ormeet in the open air? Then again, should we raise a platform or sit  in  the  sands  or the  dust?  Should  there  be  any   images?   At last we decided to sit on  the  sands  under  the  canopy  of  the  sky  and not to install  any  image. Poverty  is  an  Ashram  observance.  The Ashram exists in order to serve the starving millions. The poor have a place in it no less than others. It receives with open arms all who   are   willing   to   keep   the   rules.   In   such    an    institution  the house of worship cannot be built with bricks and mortar, the sky must suffice for roof and the quarters for walls and  pillars.  A  platform was planned but discarded later on, as its size would depend upon the indeterminate number of worshippers. And a  big  one  would cost a large sum of money. Experience has shown  the soundness of the decision not to build a house or even a platform. People from outside also attend  the  Ashram  prayers,  so  that  at  times the multitude present cannot be accommodated on the biggest of platforms.
 Again as the Ashram prayers are being increasingly imitated elsewhere, the sky-roofed temple has proved its utility. Morning and evening prayers are held wherever I go. Then there is such large attendance, especially in the evening, that prayers are possible only on open  grounds.  And  if  I  had  been  in  the   habit  of   worshipping  in a prayer  hall  only,  I  might  perhaps  never  have  thought  of public prayers during my tours.
Then again all religions are accorded equal respect in the
 Ashram. Followers of all faiths are welcome there; they may or may not believe in the worship of images. No image is kept at the congregational worship of the Ashram in order to avoid hurting anybody’s feelings. But if an Ashramite wishes  to  keep  an  image in his room, he is free to do so.

 At the morning prayer we first recite the shlokas (verses) printed in Ashram Bhajanavali (hymnal), and then sing one bhajan (hymn) followed by Ramdhun (repetition of Ramanama) and Gitapath (recitation of the Gita). In the evening we have recitation of the last 19 verses of the second chapter of the Gita, one bhajan and Ramdhun and then read some portion of a sacred book.
 The shlokas were selected by Shri Kaka Kalelkar who has been in the Ashram since its foundation. Shri Maganlal Gandhi met him in Santiniketan, when he and the children of the Phoenix Settlement went there from South Africa while I was still in England. Dinabandhu Andrews and the late Mr. Pearson were then in Santiniketan. I had advised Maganlal to stay at some place selected by Andrews. And Andrews selected Santiniketan for the party. Kaka was a teacher there and came into close contact with Maganlal. Maganlal had been feeling the want of a Sanskrit teacher which was supplied by  Kaka. Chintamani Shastri assisted him in the work. Kaka taught the children how to recite the verses repeated in prayer. Some of these verses were omitted in the Ashram prayer in order to save time. Such is the history of the verses recited at the morning prayer all these days.
 The recitation of these verses has often been objected  to  on  the ground of saving time or because it appeared to some  people that they could not well be recited by a worshipper of truth or by a non-Hindu.  There  is  no   doubt   that   these   verses   are   recited only in Hindu society, but I cannot see why a non-Hindu may not join in  or   be   present   at   the   recitation.   Muslim   and   Christian friends who have heard the verses have not raised any objection. Indeed they need not cause annoyance  to  anyone  who  respects  other faiths as much as he respects his own. They do not contain  any reflection on other people. Hindus being in an overwhelming majority in the  Ashram,  the  verses  must  be  selected  from  the sacred books of the Hindus. Not that nothing is sung or recited from non-Hindu scriptures. Indeed there were occasions on which  Imam Saheb recited verses from the Koran. Muslim and Christian
 hymns are often sung.
 But  the  verses  were  strongly  attacked  from  the   standpoint  of truth. An Ashramite modestly but firmly argued that  the  wors- hip of Sarasvati, Ganesh and the like  was  violence  done  to  truth;  for no such divinities really existed as Sarasvati seated on  a  lotus  with a vina (kind  of  musical  instrument) in  her  hands,  or  as Ganesh with a big belly and an elephant’s trunk. To this argument I replied as follows:
 ‘I claim to be a votary of truth, and yet I do not mind reciting these verses or teaching them to the children. If we condemn some shlokas on the strength of this argument, it would be tantamount to an attack on the very basis of Hinduism. Not that we may not condemn anything in Hinduism which is fit for condemnation, no matter how ancient it is. But I do not believe that this is a weak or vulnerable point of Hinduism. On the other hand I hold that it is perhaps characteristic of our faith. Sarasvati and Ganesh are not independent entities. They are all descriptive names of one God. Devoted poets have given a local habitation and a name to His countless attributes. They have done nothing wrong. Such verses deceive neither the worshippers nor  others. When a human being praises God he imagines Him to be such as he thinks fit. The God of his imagination is there for him. Even when we pray to a God devoid of form and attributes we do in fact endow Him with attributes. And attributes too are form. Fundame- ntally God is indescribable in words. We mortals must of necessity depend upon the imagination which makes and sometimes mars us too. The qualities we attribute to God with the purest of motives are true for us but fundamentally false, because all attempts at describing Him must be unsuccessful. I am intellectually conscious of this and still I cannot help dwelling upon the attributes of God. My intellect can exercise no influence over my heart. I am prepared to admit that my heart in its weakness hankers after a God with attributes. The shlokas which I have been reciting every day for the last fifteen years give me peace and hold good for me. In them I find beauty as well as poetry. Learned men tell many stories about Sarasvati, Ganesh and the like, which have their own use. I do not know their deeper meaning, as  I have not gone into it, finding it unnecessary for me. It may be that my ignorance is my salvation. I did not see that I needed to go deep into this as a part of my quest of truth. It is enough that I know my God, and although I have still to realize His living presence, I am on the right path to my destination’.
 I could hardly expect that the objectors should be satisfied with this reply. An ad hoc committee examined the whole question fully and finally recommended that the shlokas should remain as they were, for every possible selection would be viewed with disfavour by  someone or other.
 (iii)
 A hymn was sung after the  shlokas .  Indeed  singing hymns was the only item of the prayers in South Africa. The shlokas were added in India. Maganlal Gandhi was our leader in song. But we felt that the arrangement was unsatisfactory. We should have an expert singer  for  the  purpose,  and  that  singer  should  be   one   who would observe the Ashram rules. One such was found in Narayan Moreshwar Khare, a pupil of Pandit Vishnu Digambar, whom the master kindly sent to the Ashram. Pandit Khare gave us full satisfaction and is now a full member of the Ashram. He made hymn- singing interesting, and the Ashram Bhajanavali (hymnal) which is now read by thousands was in the main compiled by him. He introduced Ramdhun, the third item of our prayers.
 The fourth  item  is   recitation   of   verses   from   the   Gita. The Gita has for years been an authoritative guide to belief  and conduct for the Satyagraha Ashram. It has provided us with a test with which to determine the correctness or otherwise of ideas and courses of conduct in question. Therefore we wished that all Ashram- ites should understand the meaning of the Gita and if possible commit it to memory. If this last was not possible, we wished that they should at least read the original Sanskrit with correct pronunciation. With this end in view we began to recite part of the Gita every day. We would recite a few verses every day and continue the recitation until we had learnt them by heart. From this we proceeded to the  parayan.libtech_327_footnoteAnd the recitation is now so arranged that the whole of the Gita is finished in  fourteen  days,  and   everybody   knows   what   verses will be recited on any particular day. The first chapter is recited on every alternate Friday, and we  shall  come  to  it  on  Friday  next  (June 10, 1932). The seventh and eighth, the twelfth and thirteenth, the fourteenth and fifteenth, and the sixteenth  and  seventeenth chapters are recited on the same day in order to finish 18 chapters in 14 days.libtech_328_footnote
 
 At the evening prayer we recite the last 19 verses of the second chapter of the Gita as well as sing a hymn and repeat Ramanama. These verses describe  the  characteristics  of the  sthitaprajna  (the  man of stable understanding), which a satyagrahi too must acquire, and are recited in order that he may constantly bear them in mind.
 Repeating the same thing at prayer from day to day is objected to  on  the  ground  that   it   thus   becomes   mechanical   and   tends to be  ineffective.  It  is  true that  the  prayer  becomes mechanical. We ourselves are machines, and if we believe God to be our mover, we must  behave  like   machines   in   His   hands.   If   the   sun   and  other heavenly bodies did not work like machines, the universe would come to a standstill. But in behaving like machines, we must not  behave like inert  matter.  We  are  intelligent  beings  and  must observe rules as such. The point is not whether the contents of the prayer are always the same or differ from day to day. Even if they are full  of variety,  it  is  possible  that  they will  become  ineffective.  The Gayatri verse among Hindus, the confession of faith (kalma) among  Mussalmans,  the  typical  Christian  prayer  in   the   Sermon on the Mount have been recited by millions for centuries every day; and yet their power has not diminished but is ever on the increase.  It all depends upon the spirit behind the recitation. If an unbeliever or a parrot repeats these potent words, they will fall quite flat. On the other hand when a believer utters them always, their influence grows from day to day.  Our  staple  food  is  the  same.  The wheat-eater will take other things besides wheat, and these additional things may differ  from  time  to  time,  but the  wheat  bread  will  always   be there on the dining table. It is the eater’s staff of life, and he will never weary of it. If he conceives a dislike for it, that is a sign of the approaching dissolution of his body. The same is the case with prayer. Its principal contents must be always the same. If the soul hungers after them, she will not quarrel with the monotony of the prayer but will derive nourishment from it. She will have a sense of deprivation on the day that it has not been possible to offer prayer. She will be more downcast than one who observes a physical fast. Giving up food may now and then be beneficial for the body; indigestion of prayer
 
 recitation was finished every seven instead of every fourteen days, and the chapters were distributed among the days as follows: Friday, 1 and 2; Saturday, 3, 4 and 5;
 Sunday, 6, 7 and 8; Monday, 9, 10, 11 and 12; Tuesday, 13, 14 and 15; Wednesday,
 16 and 17; Thursday, 18”.
 for the soul is something never heard of.
 The fact is that many of us offer prayer without our soul being hungry for it. It is a fashion to believe that there is a soul; so we believe that  she  exists.  Such  is  the  sorry  plight of many  among us. Some are intellectually convinced that there is a soul, but they have not grasped  that  truth with  the   heart;   therefore   they   do   not feel the need for prayer. Many offer prayer because they live in society and think they must participate in its activities. No wonder they  hanker  after  variety.  As  a  matter  of fact  however  they   do not attend prayer. They want to enjoy the music or are merely curious or wish  to  listen   to   the   sermon.   They   are   not   there   to   be one with God.
 (iv)
 Prarthana (Gujarati word  for  prayer)  literally  means  to  ask for something, that is, to ask God for something in a spirit of humility. Here it is not used in that sense, but in the sense of praising or worshipping God, meditation and self-purification.
 But who is God? God is not some person outside ourselves or away from the universe.  He  pervades  everything,  and  is  omn- iscient as well as omnipotent. He does not need any praise or petitions. Being immanent in all beings, He hears everything and reads our innermost thoughts. He abides in our hearts and is nearer to us than the nails are to the fingers. What is the use of telling Him anything? It is in view of this difficulty that prarthana is further paraphrased as self-purification. When we speak out aloud at prayer time,  our  speech  is  addressed  not  to   God   but   to ourselves,  and is intended to shake off our torpor. Some of us are intellectually aware of God, while others are afflicted by doubt. None has seen Him face to face. We desire to recognize and realize Him, to
become one with Him, and seek to gratify that desire through prayer.
 This God whom we seek to realize is Truth. Or to put it in another way Truth is God. This Truth is not merely the truth we are expected to speak. It is That which alone is, which constitutes the stuff of which all things are made, which subsists by virtue of its own power, which is not supported by anything else but  supports everything that exists. Truth alone is eternal, everything else is momentary. It need not assume shape or form. It is pure intelligence as well as pure bliss. We call It Ishvara because everything is regulated by Its will. It and the law It promulgates are one. Therefore it is
 not a blind law. It governs the entire  universe.  To  propitiate  this Truth is prarthana which in effect means an earnest desire to be filled with the spirit of Truth. This desire should be present all the twenty-four hours. But our souls are too dull to have this awareness day and night. Therefore we offer prayers for a short time in the hope that a time will come when all our conduct will be one continuously sustained prayer.
 Such is the ideal of prayer for the Ashram, which  at  present is far, far away from it. The detailed programme outlined above is something external, but the idea is to make our very hearts prayerful. If the Ashram prayers are not still attractive, if even the inmates of the Ashram attend them under compulsion of a sort, it only means that none of us is still a man of prayer in the real sense of the term.
 In heartfelt prayer the worshipper’s attention is concentrated on the object of worship so much so that he is not conscious of anything else besides. The worshipper has  well  been  compared  to  a  lover. The lover forgets the whole world and even himself in the presence of the beloved. The identification of the worshipper with God should be closer still. It comes only after  much  striving,  self-suffering (tapas) and self-discipline. In a place which such a worshipper sanctifies by his presence, no inducements need be offered to people for attending prayers, as they are drawn to the house of prayer by the force of his devotion.
 We have dealt so far with congregational prayer,  but  great stress is also laid in the Ashram on individual and solitary prayer. One who never  prays by  himself  may  attend  congregational prayers but will not derive much advantage from them. They are absolutely necessary for a congregation, but as a congregation  is  made up of individuals, they are fruitless without individual prayers. Every  member  of the  Ashram is  therefore  reminded  now  and then that he should of his own accord give himself up to self- introspection at all times of the day. No watch can be kept that he does this, and no account can be maintained of such silent prayer.   I cannot say how far it prevails in the Ashram, but I believe that some are making more or less effort in that direction.
 III AHIMSA OR LOVE
The greatest difficulties perhaps were encountered as regards the
 observance of ahimsa. There are problems of Truth, but it is not very
 hard to understand what Truth is. But in understanding ahimsa we every now and then find ourselves out of our depth. Ahimsa was discussed in the Ashram at greater length than any other subject. Even now the question often arises whether a particular act is violent or non-violent. And even if we know the distinction between violence and non-violence, we are often unable to satisfy the demand of non- violence on account of weakness which cannot easily be overcome.
 Ahimsa means not to hurt any living creature by thought, word or deed, even for the supposed benefit of that creature. To observe this principle fully is impossible for men, who kill a number of living beings large and small as they breathe or blink or till the land. We catch and hurt snakes or scorpions for fear of being bitten and leave them in some out-of-the-way place if we do not kill them. Hurting them in this way may be unavoidable, but is clearly himsa as defined above.
 If I save the food I eat or the clothes I wear or the space I occupy, it is obvious that these can be utilized by someone else whose need is greater than mine. As my selfishness prevents him from using these things, my physical enjoyment involves violence to my poorer neighbour. When I eat cereals and vegetables in order to support life, that means violence done to vegetable life.
 Surrounded thus as I am by violence on all sides, how am I to observe non-violence? Fresh difficulties are bound to arise at every step as I try to do so.
 The violence described above is easily recognized as such. But what about our being angry with one another? A teacher inflicting corporal punishment on his pupils, a mother taking her children to task, a man losing his temper in his intercourse with equals, all these are guilty of violence, and violence of a bad type, which is not easy to tackle. Violence is there where there is attachment on the one hand and dislike on the other. How are we to get rid of it?
 The first lesson therefore that we in the Ashram must learn is that although to sever some person’s head from his body for the  sake of the country or the family or oneself is indeed a violent act, the subtle violence involved in injuring the feelings of other people day in and day out is possibly very much worse than that. Murders committed in the world will seem to be numerous when considered by themselves and not so numerous when compared with the number of deaths due to other causes; but the subtle violence involved in daily
 
 loss of temper and the like defies all attempts at calculation.
 We are constantly striving in the Ashram to deal with all these kinds of violence. All of us realize our own weakness. All of us including myself are afraid of snakes, for instance. We therefore as a rule catch them and put them out of harm’s way. But if someone kills a snake out of fear, he is not taken to task. There was once a snake in the cowshed, and it was impossible to catch it where it was. It was a risky thing to keep the cattle there; the men also were afraid  of working thereabouts. Maganlal Gandhi felt helpless and permitted them to kill that snake. I approved of his action when he told me about it. I believe that even if I had been there on the spot, I could not have done anything other than what he did. My intellect tells me that I must treat even a snake as my kinsman and at the risk of losing my life I must hold the snake in my hands and take it away from those who are afraid of it. But in my heart I do not harbour the necessary love, fearlessness and readiness to die of snake-bite. I am trying to cultivate all these qualities but have not still succeeded in the attempt. It is possible that if I am attacked by a snake, I may neither resist nor kill it. But I am not willing to place anyone else’s life in danger.
 Once in the Ashram the monkeys made a terrible nuisance of themselves and did extensive damage to the crops. The watchman tried to frighten them by making a show of hurling stones from a sling but in vain. He then actually threw stones and injured  and crippled one of the monkeys. I thought this even worse than killing it.  I therefore held discussions with co-workers in the  Ashram,  and finally we took the decision that if we could not get rid of the monkeys by gentle means short of wounding them, we must kill one or two of them and end the nuisance. Before this decision was taken there was a public discussion in the columns of Navajivan which may be consulted by the curious.libtech_329_footnote
 No one outside India thinks that one should not kill even a violent animal. Some individuals like St. Francis observed this rule, but the common people did not, so far as I am aware. The Ashram believes in the principle, but it is a pity that we have not succeeded in putting it into practice. We have not still acquired the art of doing this. It is possible that many men will have to lay down their lives before this art is mastered. For the present it is only a consummation
 
 devoutly to be wished for. The principle has long been accepted in India but the practice is very imperfect on account of our laziness and self-deception.
 Mad dogs are killed in the Ashram, the idea being that they die after much suffering and never recover. Our people torture mad dogs instead of killing them and deceive themselves into thinking that they observe non-violence. As a matter of fact they only indulge in greater violence.
 Non-violence sometimes calls upon us to put an end to the life of a living being. For instance a calf in the Ashram dairy was lame and had developed terrible sores; it could not eat and breathed with difficulty. After three days’ argument with myself and my co- workers, I had poison injected into its body and thus put an end to its life.libtech_330_footnotelibtech_331_footnoteThat  action  was  non-violent,  because  it  was  wholly  unselfish inasmuch as the sole purpose was to achieve the calf’s relief from pain. It was a surgical operation, and I should do exactly the same thing with my child, if he were in the same predicament.
 Many Hindus were shocked at this, but their reaction to the incident only betrays their ignorance of the nature of ahimsa, which has for us long ceased to be a living faith, and has been degraded into formalities complied with when not very inconvenient.
 Here we must take leave of the Ashram experiments with ahimsa as regards sub-human species.
 Ahimsa as regards sub-human life is from the Ashram point of view an important aspect but still only one aspect of this comprehensive principle. Our dealings with our fellow-men are still more important than that. The commonest form of human intercourse is either violent or non-violent. Fortunately for humanity non- violence pervades human life and is observed by men without special effort. If we had not borne with one another, mankind would have been destroyed long ago. Ahimsa would thus appear to be the law of life, but we are not thus far entitled to any credit for observing it.
 Whenever there is a clash of ephemeral interests, men tend to resort to violence. But with a deliberate observance of non-violence a person experiences a second birth or ‘conversion’. We in the Ashram are out to observe ahimsa intelligently. In so doing we meet with numerous obstacles, disappointments and trials of faith. We may not
 
 
 be satisfied with observing ahimsa in deed only. Not to think badly of anyone, not to wish ill to him though we have suffered at his hands, not to hurt him even in thought,—this is an uphill task, but therein lies the acid test of our ahimsa.
 Thieves have visited the Ashram from outside, and there have been thieves in the Ashram itself. But we do not believe in inflicting punishment on them. We do not inform the police; we put up with the losses as best we may. This rule has been infringed at times. A thief was once caught red-handed by day. The Ashramite who caught him bound him with a rope and treated him contemptously. I was in the Ashram at the time. I went to the thief, rebuked him and set him free. But as a matter of fact ahimsa demands from us something more than this. We must find out and apply methods which would put a stop to thieving altogether. For one thing we must diminish the number of our ‘possessions’ so as not to tempt others. Secondly we must bring about a reformation in the surrounding villages. And thirdly the Ashram ministry should be extended in scope so that the bad as well as the good would learn to look upon the Settlement as their own.
 We thus find that it is impossible for a man with ‘possessions’ to observe ahimsa even in the gross meaning of that term. A man of property must adopt measures for its security involving the  punishment of whoever tries to steal it. Only he can observe ahimsa who holds nothing as his own and works away in a spirit of total detachment. If  there are  many  such individuals  and  organiz- ations in society, violence will not be much in evidence. As gun- powder has a large place in a society based on violence and a soldier who can handle it with skill becomes entitled to honour and rewards, even so in a non-violent society self-suffering and self-control  are  its ‘munitions of  war’,  and  persons  endowed  with  these  qualities are its natural protectors. The world at large has not still accepted ahimsa in this sense. India has accepted it more or less but not in a comprehensive  manner.  The  Ashram holds   that   ahimsa   should be universal in scope, and that society can be built up on the foundations of ahimsa. It conducts experiments with this end in view, but these have not been very successful. I have been unable to cite in this chapter much that would hearten the votary of ahimsa. This does not apply of course to ahimsa as applied to politics, to which I propose to devote a separate chapter.libtech_332_footnote
 
 IV BRAHMACHARYA OR CHASTITY
This observance does not give rise to ever so many problems
 and dilemmas as ahimsa does. Its meaning is generally well understood; but understanding it is one thing, practising it is quite another thing and calls forth all our powers. Many of us put forth a great effort but without making any progress. Some of us even lost ground previously won. None has reached perfection. But everyone realizes its supreme importance. My striving in this direction began before 1906 when I took the vow. There were many ups and downs. It was only after I had burnt my fingers at times that I realized the deeper meaning of brahmacharya. And then I found that expositions made in books cannot be understood without actual experience, and wear a fresh aspect in the light of it. Even in the case of a simple machine like the spinning-wheel, it is one thing to read the directions for plying it, and it is another thing to put the directions into practice. New light dawns upon us as soon as we commence our practice. And what is true of simple tangible things like the wheel is still more true of spiritual states.
 A brahmachari is one who controls his organs of sense in thought, word and deed. The meaning of this definition became somewhat clear after I had kept the observance for some time, but it is not quite clear even now, for I do not claim to be a perfect brahm- achari, evil thoughts having been held in restraint but not eradicated. When they are eradicated, I will discover further implications of the definition.
 Ordinary brahmacharya is not so difficult as it is supposed to be. We have made it difficult by understanding the term in a narrow sense. Many of us play with brahmacharya like fools who put their hands in the fire and still expect to escape being burnt. Very few realize that a brahmachari has to control not one but all the organs of sense. He is no brahmachari who thinks that mere control of animal passion is the be-all and end-all of brahmacharya. No wonder if he finds it very difficult. He who attempts to control only one organ and allows all the others free play must not expect to achieve success. He might as well deliberately descend into a well and expect to keep his body dry. Those who would achieve an easy conquest of animal passion must give up all unnecessary things which stimulate it. They must control their palate and cease to read suggestive literature and to
 enjoy all luxuries. I have not the shadow of a doubt that they will find
 brahmacharya easy enough after such renun ciation.
 Some people think that it is not a breach of brahmacharya to cast a lascivious look at one’s own or another’s wife or to touch her in the same manner; but nothing could be farther from the truth. Such behaviour constitutes a direct breach of brahmacharya in the grosser sense of the term. Men and women who indulge in it deceive themselves and the world, and growing weaker day by day, make themselves easily susceptible to disease. If they stop short of a full satisfaction of desire, the credit for it is due to circumstances and not to themselves. They are bound to fall at they very first opportunity.
 In brahmacharya as conceived by the Ashram those who are married behave as if they were not married. Married people do well to renounce gratification outside the marital bond; theirs is a limited brahmacharya. But to look upon them as brahmacharis is to do violence to that glorious term.
 Such is the complete Ashram definition of brahmacharya. However there are men as well as women in the Ashram who enjoy considerable freedom in meeting one another. The ideal is that one Ashramite should have the same freedom in meeting another as is enjoyed by a son in meeting his mother or by a brother in meeting his sister. That is to say, the restrictions that are generally imposed for the protection of brahmacharya are lifted in the Satyagraha Ashram, where we believe that brahmacharya which ever stands in need of such adventitious support is no brahmacharya at all. The restrictions may be necessary at first but must wither away in time. Their disappearance does not mean that a brahmachari goes about seeking the company of women, but it does mean that if there is an occasion for him to minister to a woman, he may not refuse such ministry under the impression that it is forbidden to him.
 Woman for a brahmachari is not the ‘doorkeeper of hell’ but is an incarnation of our Mother who is in Heaven. He is no brahmachari at all whose mind is disturbed if he happens to see a woman or if he has to touch her in order to render service. A brahmachari’s reaction to a living image and to a bronze statue is one and the same. But a man who is perturbed at the very mention of woman and who is desirous of observing brahmacharya, must fly even from a figurine made of metal.
An ashram, where men and women thus live and work together,
 serve one another and try to observe brahmacharya, is exposed to many perils. Its arrangements involve to a certain extent a deliberate imitation of life in the West. I have grave doubts  about  my competence to undertake such an experiment. But this applies to all my experiments. It is on account of these doubts that I do not look upon anyone else as my disciple. Those who have joined the Ashram after due deliberation have joined me as co-workers, fully conscious of all the risks involved therein. As for the young boys and girls, I look upon  them as my own children, and as such they are automatically drawn within the pale of my experiments. These experiments are undertaken in the name of the God of Truth. He is the Master Potter while we are mere clay in His all-powerful hands.
 My experience of the Ashram so far has taught me that there is no ground for disappointment as regards the results of this pursuit of brahmacharya under difficulties. Men as well as women have on the whole derived benefit from it, but the greatest benefit has in my opinion accrued to women. Some of us have fallen, some have risen after sustaining fall. The possibility of stumbling is implicit in all such experimentation. Where there is cent per cent success, it is not an experiment but a characteristic of omniscience.
 I now come to a point of vital importance which I have reserved for treatment towards the end of the discussion. We are told in the Bhagavad Gita (II.59) that “when a man starves his  senses,  the objects of those senses disappear from him, but not the yearning for them; the yearning  too  departs  when  he  beholds  the  Supreme”, that is to say, the Truth or Brahman (God). The whole truth of the matter has here been set forth by the experienced Krishna. Fasting and all other forms of discipline  are  ineffective  without  the  grace  of God. What is the vision of the Truth or God? It does not mean seeing something with the physical eye or witnessing a miracle. Seeing God means realization of the fact that God abides in one’s heart. The yearning must persist until one has attained this realization, and will vanish  upon  realization.  It  is  with  this  end  in  view  that we keep observances, and engage ourselves in spiritual endeavour at the Ashram. Realization is the final fruit of constant  effort.  The human lover sacrifices his all for his beloved, but his sacrifice is fruitless inasmuch as it is offered for the sake of momentary pleasure. But the quest of Truth calls for even greater concentration than that of the hyuman beloved. There is joy ineffable in store for the aspirant at the end of the quest. Still very few of us are as earnest as even the
 human lover. Such being the facts of the case, what is the use of complaining that the quest of truth is an uphill task? The human beloved may be at a distance of several thousand miles; God is there in the tabernacle of the human heart, nearer to us than the finger nails are to the fingers. But what is to be done with a man who wanders all over the wide world in search of treasure which as a matter of fact is buried under his very feet?
 The brahmacharya observed by a self-restraining person is not something to be despised. It certainly serves to weaken the force of the yearning for the ‘flesh-pots of Egypt’. One may keep fasts or adopt various other methods of mortifying the flesh, but the objects of sense must be compelled to disappear. The yearning will get itself in readiness to go as this process is on. Then the seeker will have the beatific vision, and that will be the signal for the yearning to make its final exit. The treasure supposed to be lost will be recovered. He who has not put all his strength into his effort has no right to complain that he has not ‘seen’ Brahman. Observing brahmacharya is one of the means to the end which is seeing Brahman. Without brahmacharya no one may expect to see Him, and without seeing Him one cannot observe brahmacharya to perfection. The verse therefore does not rule out self-discipline but only indicates its limitations.
 All members of the Ashram, young as well as old, married as well as unmarried, try to observe brahmacharya, but only a few will observe it for life. When the young people come to  years  of  discretion, they are told that they are not bound to observe brahmacharya any longer against their will, and that whoever feels that he is unable to put forth the requisite effort has a right to marry. And when he makes the request the Ashram helps him in finding out a suitable partner in life. This position is very well understood, and the results have been uniformly good. The young men have persisted in larger numbers. The girls too have done pretty well. None of them married before she was fifteen, and many married only after they were nineteen.
 Those who wish to marry with Ashram assistance must rest satisfied with the simplest of religious ceremonies. There are no dinners, no guests invited from outside, no beating of drums. Both bride and bridegroom are dressed in hand-spun and hand-woven khadi. There are no ornaments in gold or silver. There is no marriage settlement and no dowry except a few clothes and a spinning-wheel.
 The function hardly costs even ten rupees, and takes not more than one hour. The bride and bridegroom recite in their own language the mantras (Vedic verses) of the saptapadilibtech_333_footnotethe purport of which has already been explained to them. On the day fixed for the marriage, the bride and bridegroom keep a fast, water trees, clean the cowshed and the Ashram well and read the Gita before the ceremony. Those who give away the bride also fast until they have made the gift. We now insist that the Ashram will not help to arrange a marriage between members of the same subcaste, and everyone is encouraged to seek his mate outside his own subcaste.libtech_334_footnote
 V
 NON-STEALING AND NON-POSSESSION OR POVERTY
 These two, along with truth, ahimsa and brahmacharya that have gone before, constitute the five mahavratas (primary observances) of old and have been included in the Ashram observances as they are necessary for one who seeks self-realization. But they do not call for any lengthy discussion.
 NON-STEALING 
 To take something from another without his permission is theft of course. But it is also theft to use a thing for a purpose different from the one intended by the lender or to use it for a period longer than that which has been fixed with him. The profound truth upon which this observance is based is that God never creates more than what is strictly needed for the moment. Therefore whoever appropriates more than the minimum that is really necessary for him is guilty of theft.
 NON-POSSESSION 	OR POVERTY 
 This is covered by Non-stealing. We may neither take nor keep a superfluous thing. It is therefore a breach of this observance to possess food or furniture which we do not really need. He who can do without chairs will not keep them in his house. The seeker will deliberately and voluntarily reduce his wants and cultivate progre- ssively simple habits.
Non-stealing   and   Non-possession   are   mental	states only.
 
 No human being can keep these observances to perfection. The body too is a possession, and so long as it is there, it calls for other possessions in its train. But the seeker will cultivate the spirit of detachment and give up one possession after another. Everyone  cannot be judged by the same standard. An ant may fall from grace if it stores two grains instead of one. An elephant on the other hand will have a lot of grass heaped before itself and yet it cannot be charged with having ‘great possessions’.
 These difficulties appear to have given rise to the current conception of sannyasa (renunciation of the world), which is not accepted by the Ashram. Such sannyasa may be necessary for some rare spirit who has the power of conferring benefits upon the world by only thinking good thoughts in a cave. But the world would be ruined if everyone became a cave-dweller. Ordinary men and women can only cultivate mental detachment. Whoever lives in the world and lives in it only for serving it is a sannyasi.
 We of the Ashram hope to become sannyasis in this sense. We may keep necessary things but should be ready to give up everything including our bodies. The loss of nothing whatever should worry us at all. So long as we are alive, we should render such service as we are capable of. It is a good thing if we get food to eat and clothes to wear; it is also a good thing if we don’t. We should so train our minds that no Ashramite will fail to give a good account of himself when testing time comes.
 VI BREAD LABOUR
The Ashram holds that every man and woman must work in
 order to live. This principle came home to me upon reading one of Tolstoy’s essays. Referring to the Russian writer Bondareff, Tolstoy observes that his discovery of the vital importance of bread labour is one of the most remarkable discoveries of modern times. The idea is that every healthy individual must labour enough for his food, and his intellectual faculties must be exercised not in order to obtain a living or amass a fortune but only in the service of mankind. If this principle is observed everywhere, all men would be equal, none would starve and the world would be saved from many a sin.
 It is possible that this golden rule will never be observed by the whole world. Millions observe it in spite of themselves without understanding it. But their mind is working in a contrary direction, so
 that they are unhappy themselves and their labour is not as fruitful as it should be. This state of things serves as an incentive to those who understand and seek to practise the rule. By rendering a willing obedience to it they enjoy good health as well as perfect peace and develop their capacity for service.
 Tolstoy made a deep impression on my mind, and  even  in  South Africa I began to observe the rule to the best of my ability. And ever since the Ashram was founded, bread labour has been perhaps its most characteristic feature.
 In my opinion the same principle has been set forth in the third chapter of the Gita. I do not go so far as to say that the word yajna (sacrifice) there means body labour. But when the Gita says that ‘rain comes from sacrifice’, (verse 14)libtech_335_footnotelibtech_336_footnote, I think it indicates the necessity of bodily labour. The ‘residue of sacrifice’ (verse 13)libtech_337_footnotelibtech_338_footnoteis the bread that we have won in the sweat of our brow. Labouring enough for one’s food has been classed in the Gita as a yajna. Whoever eats more than is enough for sustaining the body is a thief, for most of us hardly perform labour enough to maintain themselves. I believe that a man has no right to receive anything more than his keep, and that everyone who labours is entitled to a living wage.
 This does not rule out the division of labour. The manufacture of everything needed to satisfy essential human wants involves bodily labour, so that labour in all essential occupations counts as bread labour. But as many of us do not perform such labour, they have to take exercise in order to preserve their health. A cultivator working on his farm from day to day has not to take breathing exercise or stretch his muscles. Indeed if he observes the other laws of health, he will never be afflicted with illness.
 God never creates more than what is strictly needed for the moment, with the result that if anyone appropriates more than he really needs, he reduces his neighbour to destitution. The starvation of people in several parts of the world is due to many of us seizing very much more than we need. We may utilize the gifts of nature just as we choose, but in her books the debits are always equal to the credits. There is no balance in either column.
This law is not invalidated by the fact that men raise bigger
 
 
 crops by mechanizing agriculture and using artificial fertilizers, and similarly increase the industrial output. This only means a transformation of natural energy. Try as we might, the balance is always nil.
 Be that as it may, the observance best kept in the Ashram is that of bread labour, and no wonder. Its fulfilment is easy with ordinary care. For certain hours in the day, there is nothing to be done but work. Work is therefore bound to be put in. A worker may be lazy, inefficient or inattentive, but he works for a number of hours all the same. Again certain kinds of labour are capable of yielding an immediate product and the worker cannot idle away a considerable amount of his time. In an institution where body labour plays a prominent part there are few servants. Drawing water, splitting firewood, cleaning and filling lamps with oil, sanitary  service, sweeping the roads and houses, washing one’s clothes, cooking,—all these tasks must always be performed.
 Besides this there are various activities carried on in the Ashram as a result of and in order to help fulfilment  of  the  observances,  such as  agriculture,  dairying,   weaving,   carpentry,   tanning   and the like which must be attended  to  by  many  members  of the Ashram.
 All these activities may be deemed sufficient for keeping the observance of bread labour, but another essential feature of yajna (sacrifice) is the idea of serving others, and the Ashram will perhaps be found wanting from this latter standpoint. The Ashram ideal is to live to serve. In such an institution there is no room for idleness or shirking duty, and everything should be done with right goodwill. If this were actually the case, the Ashram ministry would be  more  fruitful than it is. But we are still very far from such a happy condition. Therefore although in a sense every activity in the Ashram is of the nature of yajna, it is compulsory for all to spin for at least one hour in the name of God incarnated as the Poor (Daridranarayana).
 People often say that in an institution like the Ashram where body labour is given pride of place there is no scope for intellectual development, but my experience is just the reverse. Everyone who has been to the Ashram has made intellectual progress as well; I know of none who was the worse on account of a sojourn in the Ashram.
Intellectual development is often supposed to mean a know-
 ledge of facts concerning the universe. I freely admit that such knowledge is not laboriously imparted to the students in the Ashram. But if intellectual progress spells understanding and discrimination, there is adequate provision for it in the Ashram. Where body labour is performed for mere wages, it is possible that the labourer becomes dull and listless. No one tells him how and why things are done; he himself has no curiosity and takes no interest in his work. But such is not the case in the Ashram. Everything including sanitary service must be done intelligently, enthusiastically and for the love of God. Thus there is scope for intellectual development in all departments of Ashram activity. Everyone is encouraged to acquire full knowledge of his own subject. Anyone who neglects to do this must answer for it. Everyone in the Ashram is a labourer; none is a wage-slave.
 It is a gross superstition to imagine that knowledge is acquired only through books. We must discard this error. Reading books has a place in life, but is useful only in its own place. If book-knowledge is cultivated at the cost of body labour, we must raise a revolt against it. Most of our time must be devoted to body labour, and only a little to reading. As in India today the rich and the so-called higher classes despise body labour, it is very necessary to insist on the dignity of labour. Even for real intellectual development one should engage in some useful bodily activity.
 It  is  desirable  if  at  all  possible  that   the   Ashram   should give the workers some more time for reading. It is also desirable that illiterate Ashramites should have a teacher to help them in their studies. But it appears that time for reading and the like cannot be given at the cost of any of the present activities of the Ashram. Nor can we engage paid teachers, and so long as the Ashram cannot attract more men who are capable of teaching ordinary school subjects, we have to manage with as many such as we have got in our midst. The school and college-educated men who are in the Ashram have not still fully acquired the skill of correlating the three R’s with body labour. This is a new experiment for all of us. But we shall learn from experience, and those of us who have received ordinary education will by and by find out ways and means of imparting their knowledge to others.
 VII SWADESHI
At the Ashram we hold that swadeshi is a universal law. A man’s
 
 first duty is to his neighbour. This does not imply hatred for the foreigner or partiality for the fellow-countryman. Our capacity for service has obvious limits. We can serve even our neighbour with some difficulty. If every one of us duly performed his duty  to  his neighbour, no one in the world who needed assistance would be left unattended. Therefore one who serves his neighbour serves all the world. As a matter of fact there is in swadeshi no room for distinction between one’s own and other people. To serve one’s neighbour is to serve the world. Indeed it is the only way open to us of serving the world. One to whom the whole world is as his family should have the power of serving the universe without moving from his place. He can exercise this power only through service rendered to his neighbour. Tolstoy goes further and says that at present we are riding on other people’s backs; it is enough only if we get down. This is another way of putting the same thing. No one can serve others without serving himself. And whoever tries to achieve his private ends without serving others harms himself as well as the world at large. The reason is obvious. All living beings are members one of another so that a person’s every act has a beneficial or harmful influence on the whole world. We cannot see this, near-sighted as we are. The influence of a single act of an individual on the world may be negligible. But that influence is there all the same, and an awareness of this truth should make us realize our responsibility.
 Swadeshi therefore does not involve any disservice to the foreigner. Still swadeshi does not reach everywhere, for that is impossible in the very nature of things. In trying to serve the world, one does not serve the world and fails to serve even the neighbour. In serving the neighbour one in effect serves the world. Only he who has performed his duty to his neighbour has the right to say, ‘All are akin to me’. But if a person says, ‘All are akin to me’, and neglecting his neighbour gives himself up to self-indulgence, he lives to himself alone.
 We find some good men who leave their own place and move all over the world serving non-neighbours. They do nothing wrong, and their activity is not an exception to the law of swadeshi. Only their capacity for service is greater. To one man, only he who lives next door to him is his neighbour. For a second man his neighbourhood is co-extensive with his village and for a third with ten surrounding villages. Thus everyone serves according to his capacity. A common man cannot do uncommon work. Definitions are framed with an eye
 to him alone, and imply everything which is not contrary to their spirit. When he observes the law of swadeshi, the ordinary man does not think that he is doing service to any others. He deals with the neighbouring producer, as it is convenient for him. But an occasion may arise when this is inconvenient. One who knows that swadeshi is the law of life will observe it even on such occasions. Many of us at present are not satisfied with the quality of goods made in India, and are tempted to buy foreign goods. It is therefore necessary to point out that swadeshi does not simply minister to our convenience but is a rule of life. Swadeshi has nothing to do with hatred of the foreigner. It can never be one’s duty to wish or to do ill to others.
 Khadi has been conceived as the symbol of swadeshi, because India has committed a heinous sin by giving it up and thus failing in the discharge of her natural duty.
 The importance of khadi and the spinning-wheel first dawned on me in 1908,libtech_339_footnotewhen I had no idea of what the wheel was like and did not even know the difference between the wheel and the loom. I had only a vague idea of the condition of India’s villages, but still I clearly saw that the chief cause of their pauperization was the destruction of the spinning-wheel, and resolved that I would try to revive it when I returned to India.
 I returned in 1915 with my mind full of these ideas. Swadeshi was one of the observances ever since the Ashram was started. But none of us knew how to spin. We therefore rested content with setting up a handloom. Some of us still retained a liking for fine cloth. No swadeshi yarn of the requisite fineness for women’s saris was available in the market. For a very short time therefore they were woven with foreign yarn. But we were soon able to obtain fine yarn from Indian mills.
 It was no easy job even to set up the handloom at the Ashram. None of us had the least idea of weaving. We obtained a loom and a weaver through friends. Maganlal Gandhi undertook to learn weaving. I conducted experiments at the Ashram and at the same time carried on swadeshi propaganda in the country. But it was like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark so long as we could not spin yarn. At
 last however I discovered the spinning-wheel, found out spinners and
 introduced  the  wheel  in   the   Ashram.   The   whole   story   has been
 
 unfolded in the Autobiography.libtech_340_footnote
 But that did not mean that our difficulties were at an end. On the other hand they increased, since such of them as were hidden till now became manifest.
 Touring in the country I saw that people would not take to the spinning-wheel as soon as they were told about it. I knew that not much money could be made by spinning, but I had no idea of how little it was. Then again the yarn that was spun would not at once be uniform as well as fine. Many could spin only coarse and weak yarn. Not all kinds of cotton were suitable for spinning. The cotton must be carded and made into slivers, and in carding much depended upon the condition of the cotton. Any and every spinning-wheel would not do. To revive the spinning-wheel thus meant the launching of a big scheme. Money alone could not do the trick. As for man-power too, hundreds of workers would be needed, and these men should be ready to learn a new art, to be satisfied with a small salary and to live out their lives in villages. But even that was not enough. The rural atmosphere was surcharged with idleness and lack of faith and hope. The wheel could make no headway if this did not improve. Thus a successful revival of the wheel could be brought about only with an army of single-minded men and women equipped with infinite patience and strong faith.
 At first I was alone in having this faith. Faith indeed was the only capital that I had, but I saw that if there is faith, everything else is added unto it. Faith enlightens the intellect and induces habits of industry. It was clear that all experiments should be conducted at and through the Ashram which indeed existed for that very purpose. I realized that spinning should be the principal physical activity of the Ashram. Thus only could it be reduced to a science. Therefore spinning was at last recognized as a mahayajna (primary sacrifice), and everyone who joined the Ashram had to learn spinning and to spin regularly every day.
 But yajna implies skill in action   libtech_341_footnoteTo spin some yarn somehow cannot be called a yajna. At first the rule was that the members should spin for  at  least  half  an  hour  every  day.  But  it was soon found that if the spinning-wheel went out of order,
 
 one could not spin even a couple of yards in half an hour. Therefore the rule was modified and members were asked to spin at least 160 rounds, one round being equal to 4 feet. Again yarn was no good if it was not uniform as well as strong. Tests of strength and uniformity were therefore devised, and we have now made such progress that spinning yarn coarser than 20s does not count as yajna.
 But granted that good yarn is spun, who would make use of it? I was sure from the first that the person who did spinning as a sacrament must not use his own yarn, but I was unable to carry conviction to others. Where was the harm if the spinner paid the wages and purchased his yarn for himself? I deceived myself and agreed that one who paid the wages and bought his own yarn should  be considered a spinning-sacrificer. This error has not still been fully rectified. Errors not dealt with a strong hand at their first appearance tend to become permanent, and are difficult to eradicate like chronic diseases.
 As a consequence of this yajna, spinning has made great strides in India, but it has still to take root in each of our villages. The reason is obvious. My faith was not coupled with knowledge. Some knowledge was acquired after mistakes had been committed. Co- workers have joined me, but are too few for the great task in hand. There are hundreds of workers, but perhaps they have not in them the requisite faith and knowledge. The root being thus weak, one may not expect to enjoy the ripest fruit.
 But for this I cannot find fault  with  anybody.  The  work  is new and wide as the ocean and it bristles with difficulties. Therefore though the result of our  activity  is  not gratifying,  it  is  still sufficient for sustaining our faith. We have every right to hope for complete success. Faithful workers, men as well as women,  have  joined in adequate numbers and have accumulated  a  fund  of  valuable experience, so that this movement is certainly destined not to perish.
 Khadi has given rise to quite a number of other activities at the Ashram as well as elsewhere in the country which cannot here be dealt with at any length. Suffice it to say that cotton crops are raised, spinning-wheels are made, cloth is dyed, and simple hand-operated machines are manufactured for all the processes from ginning to weaving. These machines are being improved from time to time. The progress made in producing a more efficient type of spinning-wheel
 is a piece of poetry to my mind.
 VIII
 REMOVAL OF UNTOUCHABILITY
 The Ashram was founded in order to serve and if necessary to die in the service of Truth. If therefore while holding that untouchability is a sinful thing, it did not do something positive in order to end it, it could hardly deserve the name of Satyagraha (adherence to Truth) Ashram. Even in South Africa we recognized untouchability as a sin. When the Ashram therefore was founded in India, removal of untouchability easily became one of its major activities.
 Within a month of the foundation of the Ashram, Dudabhai applied for admission along with his family. I had no idea that the testing time of the Ashram would arrive so soon. Dudabhai’s application was supported by Shri Amritlal Thakkar. I felt bound to admit a family which was recommended by him.
 The arrival of Dudabhai was the signal for a storm breaking upon  the  placid  atmosphere   of   the   Ashram.libtech_342_footnoteKasturba,   Maganlal Gandhi and Mrs. Maganlal had each  of them some scruples  in  living with so-called untouchables. Things came to such a pass that Kasturba should either observe Ashram rules or else leave the Ashram. But the argument that a woman in following in  her  husband’s footsteps incurs no sin appealed to her and she quieted down. I do not hold that a wife is bound to follow her husband in what she considers sinful. But I welcomed my wife’s attitude in the present case, because  I looked upon the removal of untouchability as a meritorious thing. No one could uphold untouchability and still live in the Ashram. It would have been extremely painful to me if my wife had had to leave the Ashram, seeing that she had been my companion all these days at the cost of great suffering. It was hard to be separated from her, but one must put up with every hardship that comes his way in the discharge of his duty. I had therefore no hesitation in accepting my wife’s renunciation of untouchability not as an independent person but only as a faithful wife.
 Maganlal Gandhi’s case was harder than mine. He packed up his things and came to me to bid good-bye. But who was I to bid him good-bye? I put him on his guard. I told him that the Ashram was his
 
 creation as much as mine, and would be destroyed if he left it. But he certainly did not want that it should perish. He did not need to seek my permission to leave an institution which he himself had brought into existence. But to leave the Ashram should be something unthinkable for him. This appeal did not fall on deaf ears. Perhaps Maganlal had thought of leaving in order to give me a free hand. I could endure to be separated from all the world besides but not from Maganlal. I therefore suggested that he should go to Madras with family. He and his wife would learn more of weaving there and would have more time to ponder over the situation that had developed. So they went and lived in Madras for six months. They mastered the art of weaving and after mature consideration also washed their hearts clean of untouchability.libtech_343_footnote
 The internal storm thus blew over. But there was a storm outside the Ashram too. The chief person who financed the Ashram discontinued his assistance. There was even a possibility that the Ashramites should not  be  allowed  any  more  to  draw  water  from the neighbour’s well. But all difficulties were surmounted  by  and  by. As regards finance, something happened which was not unlike Narasinha   Mehta’s   hundi   (bill   of   exchange)   being   honoured at  Dvaravati.  A  sum  of thirteen  thousand  rupees  was  received from an unexpected source. Thus the Ashram ordeal in keeping Dudabhai at any cost was not so severe as it might well have been. The Ashram passed that test as regards its opposition to untouchability. ‘Untouchable’ families come to the Ashram freely and live in it. Dudabhai’s daughter Lakshmi has become a full member of the family.
 Three callings followed by the so-called untouchables are practised in the Ashram, and improved methods are devised in each. Everyone in the Ashram has in turn to do sanitary service, which is looked upon not as a special calling but a universal duty. No outside labour is engaged for this work, which is carried on on lines suggested by Dr. Poore. Night-soil is buried in shallow trenches and is thus converted into manure in only a few days. Dr. Poore says that the soil is living up to a depth of twelve inches. Millions of bacteria are there to clean up dirt. Sunlight and air penetrate the ground to that depth.
 
 Therefore night-soil buried in the upper layer readily combines with the earth.
 Closets are so constructed that they are free from smell and there is no difficulty in cleaning them. Everyone who visits them covers the night-soil with plenty of dry earth, so that the top is always dry.
 Then again we have handloom weaving. Coarse khadi was manufactured in Gujarat by Harijan weavers only. The industry was almost on the verge of destruction, and many weavers were compelled to take up scavenging for a living. But now there has been a revival of this handicraft.
 Thirdly we have tanning. We shall deal with it in the chapter on the Ashram dairy.
 The Ashram does not believe in subcastes. There are no restrictions on interdining and all Ashramites sit to dinner in the same line. But no propaganda in favour of interdining is carried on outside the Ashram, as it is unnecessary for the removal of untouchability, which implies the lifting of bans imposed on Harijans in public institutions and discarding the superstition that a man is polluted by the touch of certain persons by reason of their birth in a particular caste. This disability can also be removed by legislation. Interdining and intermarriage are reforms of a different type which cannot be promoted by legislation or social pressure. The Ashramites therefore feel themselves free to take permitted food with everyone else but do not carry on any such propaganda.
 Schools are established and wells sunk for Harijans through the Ashram which chiefly finds the finance for such activities. The real anti-untouchability work carried on in the Ashram is the reformed conduct of the Ashramites. There is no room in the Ashram for any ideas of high and low.
 However  the  Ashram  believes  that  varnaslibtech_344_footnoteand   ashramslibtech_345_footnoteare essential elements of Hinduism. Only it puts a different interpretation on these time-honoured terms. Four varnas and four ashramas are an arrangement not peculiar to Hinduism but capable of world-wide application, and a universal rule, the breach of which has involved humanity in numerous disasters. The four ashrams are brahm-
 
 acharya, garhasthya, vanaprasthya and sannyasa. Brahmacharya is the stage during which men as well as women prosecute their studies, and should not only observe brahmacharya but should also be free from any other burden except that of studies. This lasts till at least the twenty-fifth year, when the student becomes a householder if  he wishes. Almost all the students thus become householders. But this stage should close at the age of fifty. During that period the householder enjoys the pleasures of life, makes money, practises a profession and rears a family. From fifty to seventy-five wife and husband should live apart and wholly devote themselves to the service of the people. They must leave their families and try to look upon the world as a big family. During the last 25 years they should become sannyasis, live apart, set to the people an example of ideal religious life and maintain themselves with whatever the people choose to give them. It is clear that society as a whole would be elevated if many carried out this scheme in their lives.
 So far as I am aware, the ashrama arrangement is unknown outside India, but even in India it has practically disappeared  at present. There is no such thing now as brahmacharya, which is intended to be the foundation of life. For the rest we have sannyasis, most of them such only in name, with nothing of sannyasa about them except the orange robe. Many of them are ignorant, and some who have acquired learning are not knowers of Brahman  but  fanatics. There are some honourable exceptions but even these well-conducted monks lack the lustre we love to associate with sannyasa. It is possible that some real sannyasis lead a solitary life. But it is obvious that sannyasa as a stage in life has fallen into desuetude. A society which is served by able sannyasis would not be poor in spirit, unprovided even with the necessaries of life, and politically dependent, as Hindu society is at present. If sannyasa were with us a living thing, it would exert a powerful influence on neighbouring faiths, for the sannyasi is  a servant not only of Hinduism but of all the faiths of mankind.
 But we can never hope to see such sannyasis unless brahmach- arya is observed in the country. As for vanaprasthya, there is no trace of it. The last stage we have to consider is that of the householder. But our householders are given to unregulated self-indulgence. House- holders in the absence of the three other ashramas live like brutes. Self-restraint is the one thing which differentiates man from beast, but it is practised no longer.
 
 The Ashram is engaged in the great endeavour to resuscitate the four ashramas. It is like an ant trying to lift a bag of sugar. This effort though apparently ridiculous is part of the Ashram quest of truth. All the inmates of the ashram therefore observe brahmacharya. Permanent members must observe it for life. All the inmates are not members in this sense. Only a few are members, the rest are students. If this effort is crowned with success, we may hope to see a revival of the ashrama scheme of life. The sixteen years during which  the Ashram has functioned are not a sufficiently long period for the assessment of results. I have no idea of the time when such assessment will be possible. I can only say that there is nothing like dissatisfaction with the progress achieved up to date.
 If the ashrama scheme has broken down, the plight of the varnas is equally bad. At first there were four varnas (classes); but now there are innumerable sections or only one. If we take it that there are as many varnas as there are castes and subcastes, their name is Legion; on the other hand if, as I think, varnas have nothing to do with caste, there is only a single varna left and that is the Shudra. We are here not finding fault with anybody but only stating the facts of the case. Shudras are those who serve and are dependent upon others. India is a dependency; therefore every Indian is a Shudra. The cultivator does not own his land, the merchant his merchandise. There is hardly a Kshatriya or a Brahmin who possesses the virtues which the Shastras attribute to his varna.
 My impression is that there was  no  idea  of high  and  low  when the varna system was discovered. No one is high and no one is low in this world; therefore he who  thinks  he  belongs  to  a  high class is never high-class, and he who believes himself to be low is merely the victim of ignorance. He has been taught by his masters that he is low. If a Brahmin has knowledge, those who are without it will respect him as a matter of course. But if he is puffed up by the respect thus shown to him and imagines himself to belong to a high class, he directly ceases to be a Brahmin. Virtue will always command respect, but when the man of virtue thinks much of himself, his virtue ceases to have any significance for the world. Talents of all kinds are a trust and must be utilized for the benefit of society. The individual has no right to live unto himself. Indeed it is impossible to live unto oneself. We fully live unto ourselves when we live unto society.
No matter what was the position in ancient times, no one can
 nowadays go through life claiming to belong to a high class. Society will not willingly admit any such claim to superiority, but only under duress. The world is now wide awake. This awakening has perhaps given rise to some licence, but even so public opinion is not now prepared to accept any distinctions of high and low, which are being attacked on all sides. There is ever increasing realization that all are equal as human souls. The fact that we are all the creatures of one God rules out all ideas of high and low. When we say that no one is high-born or low-born, it does not mean that all have or ought to have equal talents. All have not equal talents, equal property or equal opportunities. Still all are equal like brothers and sisters of different dispositions, abilities and ages.
 If therefore the varna system is a spiritual arrangement, there cannot be any place in it for high and low.
 Thus there are four varnas, all equal in status, and they are determined by birth. They can be changed by a person choosing another profession, but if varnas are not as a rule determined by birth, they tend to lose all meaning.
 The varna system is ethical as well as economic. It recognizes the influence of previous lives and of heredity. All are not born with equal powers and similar tendencies. Neither the parents nor the State can measure the intelligence of each child. But there would be no difficulty if each child is prepared for the profession indicated by heredity, environment and the influence of former lives; no  time would be lost in fruitless experimentation, there would be no soul- killing competition, a spirit of contentment would pervade society and there would be no struggle for existence.
 The varna system implies the obliteration of all distinctions of high and low. If the carpenter is held to be superior to the shoemaker and the pleader or doctor is superior to both of them, no one would willingly become a shoemaker or carpenter and all would try to become pleaders or doctors. They would be entitled to do so and to be praised for doing so. That is to say, the varna system would be looked upon as an evil and abolished as such.
 But when it is suggested that everyone should practise his  father’s profession, the suggestion is coupled with the condition that the practitioner of every profession will earn only a living wage and no more. If the carpenter earns more than a shoemaker  and  the pleader or doctor more than both, everyone would become a lawyer
 
 or doctor. Such is the case at present, with the result that hatred has increased and there are more lawyers and doctors than are necessary. It may be that society needs the lawyer or doctor even as it needs the shoemaker and the carpenter. These four professions are here taken only as illustrations and for comparison. It would be irrelevant to stop to consider whether society has particular need or no need at all for this, that or the other profession.
 This principle then is an integral part of the varna system, that learning is not a trade and may not be used in order to amass riches. Therefore in so far as his ministrations may be necessary, the lawyer or doctor ought by practising his profession to earn only a living wage. And such was actually the case formerly. The village vaidya (physician) did not earn more than the carpenter but only a living wage. In short the emoluments of all crafts and professions should be equal and amount to a living wage. The number of varnas has no sanctity about it; their value is due to the fact that they define the duties of man. Varnas may be supposed to be one or more just as we like. The scriptures enumerate four of them. But when once we have assigned equal status to all, it makes little difference whether we think that there are four of them or that there is only one.
 Such is the varna system which the Ashram is trying to resuscitate. It is like Dame Partington with her mop, trying to push back the Atlantic Ocean. I have already mentioned its two fundamental principles, namely, that there are no high and low, and everyone is entitled to a living wage, the living wage being the same for all. In so far as these principles win acceptance, they will render a positive service to society.
 It may be objected that if such a plan is accepted there will be no incentive for the acquisition of knowledge. But the object with which knowledge is acquired nowadays tends to corrupt it, and therefore the absence of an incentive will be entirely beneficial. Knowledge truly so called is intended for one’s salvation, that is to say, service of mankind. Whoever has a desire to render service will certainly try to equip himself with the requisite knowledge, and his knowledge will be an ornament to himself as well as to society. Again when the temptation to amass riches is removed, there will be a change for the better in the curriculum of studies as well as in the methods of education. There is much misuse of knowledge at present. This misuse will be reduced to the minimum in the ‘new order’.
 Even then there will be scope for competition in trying to be good and helpful. And there will be no discontent or disorder as all will receive a living wage.
 Varna is wrongly understood today. That wrong understanding must make way for the principles outlined above. Untouchability must go, and varnas should have nothing to do with interdining or intermarriage. A person will dine with and marry whom he likes. But as a rule he will marry someone who belongs to the same varna as himself. But if he marries a person belonging to another varna, his act will not count as a sin. A person will be boycotted not by the varna but by society at large when his conduct justifies such a measure. Society will be better constituted than it is at present, and the impurity and hypocrisy which infest it now will be dislodged.

 AGRICULTURE
 This department of Ashram activities owes its existence to Maganlal Gandhi. But for him I would not have had the courage to take up agriculture at all, although an ashram without it would be something like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark. For we had not the requisite skill and environment for it as I thought. Agriculture is a very big undertaking and would call for a lot of land, money and man-power. I was afraid that it would distract our attention from other necessary things which could be done and would not wait. But Maganlal was insistent and I yielded to him. ‘Let me do it’, he said, ‘if only for my own diversion’. Maganlal hardly ever argued with me. He thought it his duty to carry out my ideas. If he did not understand them or if he disagreed, he would tell me so. If even then I stuck to my plans, he would take it that they were correct, and execute them. In fact he believed that an ashram without agriculture was something not to be thought of, and he would have had to make out a case for his belief. Instead he put forward the supreme argument of love and the Ashram launched upon agriculture. Most of the trees in the Ashram were planted by Maganlal or at his instance.
 I still have my doubts about agriculture. Even today I cannot claim that it is a full-fledged Ashram activity. But I am not sorry for what little cultivation of the soil is done in the Ashram. A considerable amount of money has been sunk in it. It is not possible to show that it is self-supporting. However I am inclined to think that this much farming was necessary for the Ashram. No farming, no Ashram; for it
 must grow its own vegetables and fruit as far as possible. Indeed later on Maganlal took a vow that he would restrict himself to the use of Ashram-grown vegetables. An ashram should acquire the capacity to grow its own food grains and grass for the cattle. It may not carry on agricultural research, but an ashram without its farm would look like a face without the nose.
 The Ashram farm is only in an experimental stage. It has not much to teach anybody. it is intended to impart only an elementary knowledge of agriculture. At first there was not a single tree in the Ashram, but now there are many trees, planted with a view to their utility. Vegetables are grown as well as some fruit and fodder. Night- soil is used as manure with satisfactory results.
 Ancient ploughs are used as well as modern improved models, water is pumped from wells by methods which can be followed in villages. We are rather partial to ancient implements which are suitable for the poor farmer. They may be susceptible of some slight improvement, but nothing definite can be said about it, as the Ashram has not the time to apply its mind to the subject.
 X
 DAIRY
 The Ashram ideal is to do without milk, as it holds that the milk of animals like meat is no food for mankind. For a year and more no milk or ghee was used in the Ashram, but as the health of the children as well as the adults suffered under this regimen, first ghee and then milk had to be added to the Ashram dietary. And when this was done, it was clear that we must keep cattle in the Ashram.
 The Ashram believes in goraksha (cow-protection)  as  a religious duty. But the word goraksha savours of pride. Man is incompetent to ‘protect’ animals, being himself in need of protection from God who is the Protector of all life. The word goraksha was therefore replaced by goseva (cow-service). But as the experiment of doing without milk or ghee and thus serving the cow without any selfish considerations did not succeed, cattle were kept in the Ashram. We had buffaloes as well as cows and bullocks at first, as we had not yet realized that it was our duty to keep cows and bullocks only to the exclusion of the buffalo.
 But it became clear day by day that cow-service alone at present stood for the service of all sub-human life. It is the first step beyond which we have not the resources to go for the time being. Again cow-
 slaughter is very often the cause of Hindu-Muslim tension.  The Ashram believes that it is not the duty of a Hindu, nor has he the right to take away a Muslim’s cow by force. There is no service to or protection of the cow in trying to save her by force; on the other hand it only expedites slaughter. Hindus can save the cow and her progeny only by doing their duty to her and thus making her slaughter a costly act which no one can afford to do. Hindu society does not discharge this duty at present. The cow suffers from neglect. The buffalo gives more and richer milk than the cow, and keeping a buffalo costs less than keeping a cow. Again if the buffalo brings forth a bull calf, people do not care what becomes of him because buffalo ‘protection’ or ‘service’ is not a religious duty for them. Hindu society has thus been short-sighted, cowardly, ignorant and selfish enough to neglect the cow and has installed the buffalo in her place, injuring both of them in the process. The buffalo’s interest is not served by our keeping her, but lies in her freedom. To keep the buffalo means torturing its bull calf to death. This is not the case in all the provinces, but where the buffalo bull is useless for agricultural purposes as in Gujarat for instance, it is doomed to a premature death.
 On account of these considerations, buffaloes were disposed of and the Ashram now insists on keeping cows and bullocks only. Improvement of breed, increasing the quantity and enriching the quality of milk by giving various feeds, the art of preserving milk and extracting butter from it more easily, least painful methods of castrating bull calves,—all these things are attended to. It is in an experimental stage, but the Ashram does believe that the cow will pay for its keep if she is well treated and all her products are fully utilized.
 Many perhaps are not aware that a man cannot simply afford to keep a cow, and slaughter is inevitable so long as that is the case. Mankind is not so benevolent that it  will  die  to  save  the cow  or allow it to live on itself as  a  parasite.  The  cattle  population  at present is so large that if it is well fed, the human population will not have enough food left for itself. We must therefore prove the propo- sition  that  the   cow  if  well  kept  is  capable  of greater  production. If this proposition is to be proved, Hindu society must discard   some superstitions masquerading as religion. Hindus do not utilize the bones, etc., of dead cows; they do not care what becomes of cattle when they are dead. Instead of looking upon the occupation of a tanner as sacred, they think it unclean. Emaciated cattle are exported to and slaughtered in Australia where their bones are converted into
 manure, their flesh into meat extract and their hides into boots and shoes. The meat extract, the manure and the shoes are  then  re- exported to India and used without any compunction.
 This stupidity makes for the destruction of the cow, and puts the country to huge economic losses. This is not religion but the very negation of it. Tanning has therefore been introduced in the Ashram. None of us is still a skilled tanner. No tanner from outside who would keep the Ashram rules has been available. But all the same tanning is an integral part of Ashram industry and we have every hope that it will be developed and propagated like spinning. The cow will cease to be a burden to the country only if dead cattle are fully utilized. Even then there will not be any profits. Religion is never opposed to economics, but it is always ranged in opposition to profits. If the cow is to pay for its keep, dead cattle should not be allowed to go to waste or to swell the profits of large-scale tanneries. This cannot be done by force. But Hindu society should keep the cow, treat her and her progeny well so long as they are alive, cherish them in their old age, and fully utilize their carcases when they are dead. Thus alone can the cow be saved, and in saving her we shall perhaps learn how to save the rest of the sub-human creation. Thanks to our ignorance, laziness and hatred, the cow today is hastening to her destruction. As for the other cattle, the less said about them the better.
 The Ashram suggests that all goshalas and pinjrapoles should be organized religiously and scientifically. The rich should have their own goshalas and insist on using cow’s milk and ghee only. Trading in cow’s milk should be looked upon as a sin, and the well-to-do should manage public goshalas so as to make both ends meet. The cow would then soon be saved.
 The Ashram at present has a limited object in view: to conduct a model goshala at the Ashram, to breed good cows and bullocks, to utilize their carcases fully when they are dead so as to show that cow- keeping is an economic proposition, to train workers and provide for their employment upon the completion of their training. This work is going on at present. There are many difficulties, but we are fully confident of success.
 XI
 EDUCATION
 The word is here used in a  special  as  well  as  the  current  sense. The Ashram experiment in education was a trial for us as
 nothing else was.
 We saw at once that the women and children in the Ashram should be taught to read and write, and a little later on that there should be similar facilities for even the illiterate men that came to the Ashram. Those who had already joined the Ashram could not undertake to teach. If capable teachers were to be attracted to the Ashram, the rule of brahmacharya had to be relaxed in their case. The Ashram was therefore divided into two sections, the teachers’ quarters and the Ashram proper.
 Human beings cannot overcome their weakness all at once. As soon as the two sections came into being, a feeling of superiority and inferiority poisoned the Ashram atmosphere in spite of all our efforts to scotch it. The Ashramites developed spiritual pride, which the teachers could not tolerate. This pride was an obstacle in  the attainment of the Ashram ideal and therefore an aspect of untruth as well. If brahmacharya was to be observed in its perfection,  the  division was inevitable. But the brahmacharis had no reason to think too highly of themselves. It may be that the brahmacharis who sinned mentally in spite of themselves were retrogressing while those who did not claim to be brahmacharis but liked brahmacharya were making progress. This was clear to the intellect but it was not easy for all of us to put it into practice.
 Then again there were differences of opinion as regards the method of education which gave rise to difficulties in administration. There were bitter discussions, but at last all calmed down and learned the lesson of forbearance. This was in my view a triumph of truth, the goal of all Ashram endeavour. Those who held divergent views harboured no evil intentions in their minds, and were indeed grieved at the divergence. They wished to practise truth as they saw it. Their partiality for their own stand-point came in the way of their giving due weight to the arguments of their opponents, Hence the quarrels which put our charity to a severe test.
 I have my own perhaps peculiar views on education which have not been accepted by my colleagues in full, and here they are:
  Young 	boys and girls 	should have co-education 	till they are 	eight years of age.  Their 	education should 	mainly consist 	in manual training under 	the supervision 	of an educationist. The special aptitudes of each child should be recognized in 
 determining the kind of work he or she should do.
  The 	reasons for 	every process 	should be 	explained when 	the process 	is being 	carried on.  General 	knowledge should 	be imparted 	to each 	child as 	he begins 	to understand 	things. Learning 	to read 	or write 	should come later.  The 	child should first be 	taught to 	draw simple geometrical 	figures, and 	when he has 	learnt to 	draw these with ease, he 	should be 	taught to 	write the alphabet. 	If this 	is done 	he will 	write a good 	hand from the 	very first.  Reading 	should come before writing. 	The letters 	should be 	treated as pictures to be recognized and later on to be copied.  A 	child taught 	on these lines will have 	acquired considerable 	knowledge according to 	his capacity 	by the 	time he 	is eight. Nothing 	should be taught 	to a 	child by 	 force. He 	should be 	interested in 	everything taught to him.  Education 	should appear to 	the child 	like play. 	Play is 	an essential 	part of education.  All 	education should 	be imparted 	through the 	mother tongue.  The 	child should 	be taught 	Hindi-Urdu as the 	national language, 	before he learns letters.  Religious 	education is 	indispensable and 	the child should 	get it 	by watching the 	teacher’s conduct and 	by hearing him 	talk about it.  Nine 	to sixteen 	constitutes the 	second stage in 	the child’s 	education.  It 	is desirable that 	boys and girls 	should have co-education during 	the second 	stage also as far as possible.  Hindu 	children should now 	be taught 	Sanskrit, and Muslim 	children Arabic.  Manual 	training should be 	continued during 	the second 	stage. Literary 	education should be 	allotted more 	time according to 	necessity.  The 	boys during this 	stage should be 	taught their parents’ 	vocation in such a way that they will by their own choice obtain their 
 livelihood by practising the hereditary craft. This does not apply to the girls.
  During 	this stage the child 	should acquire 	a general 	knowledge of 	world history 	and geography, botany, 	astronomy, arithmetic, 	geometry, and algebra. Each child should now be taught to sew and to cook.  Sixteen 	to twenty-five 	is the 	third stage, during 	which every young 	person should have an 	education according to 	his or 	her wishes 	and circumstances.  During 	the second 	stage (9-16) education should be 	self- supporting; 	that is, the child, 	all the time 	that he is learning, 	is working 	upon some industry, the 	proceeds of 	which will 	meet the expenditure of 	the school.  Production 	starts from 	the very beginning, but 	during the 	first stage it 	does not 	still catch up 	with the expenditure.  Teachers 	should be paid 	not very high salaries 	but only a 	living wage. They 	should be 	inspired by 	a spirit 	of service. 	It is a 	despicable thing 	to take 	any Tom, 	Dick or Harry 	as a 	teacher in 	the primary 	stage. All teachers 	should be men 	of character.  Big 	and expensive 	buildings are 	not necessary 	for educational institutions.  English 	should be 	taught only as 	one of 	several languages. 	As Hindi 	is the national 	language, English is to 	be used in 	dealing with 	other nations and 	international commerce. 
 As for women’s education I am not sure whether it should be different from men’s and when it should begin. But I am strongly of opinion that women should have the same facilities as men and even special facilities where necessary.
 There should be night schools for illiterate adults. But I do not think that they must be taught the three R’s; they must be helped to acquire general knowledge through lectures, etc., and if they wish, we should arrange to teach them the three R’s also.
 Experiments in the Ashram have convinced us of one thing, viz., that industry in general and spinning in particular should have pride of place in education, which must be largely self-supporting as well as related to and tending to the betterment of rural life.
 In these experiments we have achieved the largest measure of success with the women, who have imbibed the spirit of freedom
 
 and self-confidence as no other class of women have done to my knowledge. This  success  is  due  to  the  Ashram  atmosphere. Women in the Ashram are not subject to any restraint which is not imposed on the men as well. They are placed on a footing of absolute equality with the men in all activities. Not a single Ashram task is assigned to the women to the exclusion of the men. Cooking is  attended to by both. Women are of course exempted from work which is beyond their strength; otherwise men and women work together everywhere. There is no such thing as  purdah or  lajlibtech_346_footnotelibtech_347_footnotein the Ashram. No matter from where she has come, a woman, as soon as she enters the Ashram, breathes the air of freedom and casts out all fear from her mind. And I believe that the Ashram observance of brahmacharya has made a big contribution to this state of things. Adult girls live in the Ashram as virgins. We are aware that this experiment is fraught with risk but we feel that no awakening among women is possible without incurring it.
 Women cannot make any progress so long as there are child marriages. All girls are supposed to be in duty bound to marry and that too before menstruation commences, and widow remarriage is not permitted. Women, therefore, when they join the Ashram, are told that these social customs are wrong and irreligious. But they are not shocked as they find the Ashram practising what it preaches.
 Not much of what is usually called education will be observed in the Ashram. Still we find that the old as well as the young, women as well as men are eager to acquire knowledge and complain that they have no time for it. This is a good sign. Many who join the Ashram are not educated or even interested in education. Some of them can hardly read or write. They had no desire for progress so long as they had not joined the Ashram. But when they have lived in the Ashram for a little while, they conceive a desire for increasing their knowl- edge. This is a great thing, as to create a desire for knowledge is very often the first step to be taken. But I do not regret it very much that there are insufficient facilities in the Ashram calculated to satisfy this desire. The observances kept in the Ashram will perhaps prevent a sufficient number of qualified teachers from joining it. We must therefore rest satisfied with such Ashramites as can be trained to teach. The numerous activities of the Ashram may come in the way of their acquiring the requisite qualifications at all or at an early date. But it
 
 does not matter much, as the desire for knowledge can be satisfied later as well as sooner, being independent of a time-limit. Real education begins after a child has left school. One who has appreciated the value of studies is a student all his life. His knowledge must increase from day to day while he is discharging his duty in a conscientious manner. And this is well understood in the Ashram.
 The superstition that no education is possible without a teacher is an obstacle in the path of educational progress. A man’s  real  teacher is himself. And nowadays there are numerous aids available for self-education. A diligent person can easily acquire knowledge about many things by himself and obtain the assistance of a teacher when it is needed. Experience is the biggest of all schools. Quite a number of crafts cannot be learnt at school but only in the workshop. Knowledge of these acquired at school is often only parrot-like. Other subjects can be learnt with the help of books. Therefore what adults need is not so much a school as a thirst for knowledge, diligence and self-confidence.
 The education of children is primarily a duty to be discharged by the parents. Therefore the creation of a vital educational atmos- phere is more important than the foundation of numerous schools. When once this atmosphere has been established on a firm footing the schools will come in due course.
 This is the Ashram ideal of education which has been realized to some extent, as every department of Ashram activity is a veritable school.
 XII
 SATYAGRAHA
 The various activities of the Ashram have already been covered more or less. The Ashram came into existence to seek the Truth by adhering to truthful conduct. And while doing so, if we are required to use the weapon of satyagraha, the Ashram may experiment with it, may explore its rules and limitations. The broad framework of these rules has also been discussed.
 But what are the limits of satyagraha? When can this weapon be employed with vigour? Man’s adherence to truth is also satyagraha. It is not this form of satyagraha that is being discussed here. I am examining its utility as a weapon against an opponent.
 
 Such satyagraha can be offered against associates, relatives, society, the State and the world. At the root of it . . .libtech_348_footnote

  LETTER TO BHAGWANJI P. PANDYA 
 July 12, 1932
 CHI. BHAGWANJI,
 It is enough that you apologized to Lakshmidevi; there is no need to fuss over it. You can come over whenever you get leave. The renunciation that we value is mental; it is not going into the forest. Without it nothing is complete, At present these is no question of going to Wardha. It may be considered after Vinoba  is  released. ‘Never say die even if it costs your life.’

         DEAR 	COL. DOYLE,   LETTER TO E. E. DOYLE     July 	13, 1932 
  	You will please excuse me for worrying you again over my troubles. 	Major Bhandari told me yesterday that, in answer to my letter of the 	9th instant, he was to inform me that there was no delay either in 	your office or Major Bhandari’s in attending to my correspondence 	as soon as it was received from the Government. This  I knew. My 	inquiry was exactly about the Government’s procedure. I have been 	permitted to write letters to friends outside and fellow- prisoners, 	including those at Yeravda whether male or female. I have written to 	the latter as regularly as to my people at the Ashram. There is no 	use my writing to the fellow-prisoners in this Jail if my letters 	and theirs are not exchanged quickly. The letters naturally relate 	to mutual welfare and the welfare of those in whom they and I are 	interested. The 	same thing applies to the Ashram letters.    
 Some of the letters I receive from others are from my standpoint important. Whether they are regarded by the authorities as important or otherwise, I should not like to lose them.
 My experience of past imprisonment is that when the corresp- ondence goes to the Government, it takes time to receive attention. In 1930, in the commencement my letters were sent to the  Government and I know that they took nearly six weeks before I could get the first batch given to me and this after repeated requests. Subsequently Major Martin, the then Superintendent, was empowered to deal with the correspondence and naturally there was no delay. Of course I can have nothing to say as to who examines my correspondence. What I am concerned about is:
   What 		are exactly the 		revised instructions about 		my correspondence?  How 		long shall I 		have to 		wait before I 		receive my 		letters and 		before what I write is posted?  Shall 		I continue 		to receive 		back those letters 		which may 		be rejected, 		and as before 		be given 		the reasons 		for rejection?  Will 		the letters 		and parcels 		withheld from me 		be treated as 		my property 		and cared 		for and delivered 		to me whenever 		I may 		be discharged?  
 I shall thank you to forward this letter to the Government and procure for me an early reply.
 Yours sincerely,

         CHI. 	MIRA,   LETTER TO MIRABEHN     July 	14, 1932 
  	Your letter of 7th instant came to hand this morning, (14th). Just 	now things are all upside down so far as my correspondence is 	concerned. All of it goes to the Government. What happens then I do 	not know. I am inquiring. Such is prison life. It is a good 	discipline in patience. I 	am glad my letters gave some consolation to Damodardas

  LETTER TO M.A. KHANlibtech_351_footnote 
 July 14, 1932
 
 DEAR FRIEND,
 I  thank  you  for   your  admonition.   You   do   not   expect me to argue with you. I fear that as a prisoner, I would not be permitted to enter into argument over political matters. But I canlibtech_352_footnotetell you that deep thinking in the solitude of a jail has not induced a change in my outlook.

         DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER TO A. VELUSAMI     July 	14, 1932 
  	I have your letter of 7th instant. I never got yours of 12th  March 	last.  	There can be no manner of doubt that this universe of sentient 	beings is governed by a Law. If you can think of a law without its 	giver, I would say that the Law is the Law-Giver, i.e., God. When we 	pray to the Law, we simply yearn after knowing the Law and obeying     SARDAR: 	Why did you write a reply to this abusive letter in your hand? BAPU: 	To a person like him I must write in my own hand.  SARDAR: 	Because he has abused you? This is what makes many people think too 	highly of themselves.  BAPU: 	I do not think this has done us any harm. (Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, “The  Indian 	Franchise”, 16-12-1895.)  
 it we become what we yearn after. Hence the necessity for prayers. Though our present life is governed by our past, our future must by that very law of cause and effect be affected by what we do now. To the extent therefore that we feel the choice between two or more courses, we must make that choice.
 Why evil exists and what it is are questions which appear to be beyond our limited reason. It should be enough to know that both good and evil exist. And as often as we can distinguish between good and evil, we must choose the one and shun the other.
      VELUSAMI 	SIVAGANGA  Yours,  M. K. GANDHI

   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI     CHI. 	NARANDAS,    July 	16, 1932 
  	I got today, Saturday, your mail which ordinarily I should have got 	on Tuesday. We should regard it as God’s grace that I got it at 	all. But we should understand that things have become uncertain now. 	You will probably have received my letters by now. All of you are 	having experience of the practice of non-attachment, and so are we 	here. What could a prisoner do if he was not permitted to write or 	receive any letters or see visitors? If, then, he is granted some 	little freedom, why should he expect too much because of that?  If, 	therefore, you stop getting my letters, you should conclude that 	something must have happened. I will of course go on writing 	regularly about something or other.  	It was a very good thing that the inmate of the  Raniparaj Ashram 	was cremated. If you have come to know his age, let me know, and 	also if you know of what he died.  	Narmada’slibtech_357_footnotestory 	reads like an incident in a novel. From here I cannot guide either 	you or her. If necessary, you may consult Bhai      
 Mavalankarlibtech_358_footnoteabout the matter or, if he cannot get any time or if he is not there, consult Bhai Tulsidas or Fulshankar, the lawyer. In the lastanalysis this is a question of what is right from the point of view of dharma. You may, therefore, do what you think dharma requires. You have done perfectly right in writing to her husband.
 If Chhotubhailibtech_359_footnotelibtech_360_footnotestays for the present in the Ashram to look after his aged father, we may perhaps welcome the latter, However, we cannot let it become a practice for inmates of the Ashram who have invalid relations to bring them to the Ashram. If we do that, the Ashram would be disrupted. This is a difficult time and Chhotubhai’s father has already arrived, and so I have suggested a via media. If Chhotubhai does not stay in the Ashram, the Ashram should certainly not accept the responsibility of looking after his father.
 If, through some unavoidable reason, Hariyomal’slibtech_361_footnotelibtech_362_footnoteson cannot come to the Ashram, I do not think it would be too big a sum to send fifteen rupees every month for him. We have given such help on several occasions. The rule, of course, is what you say it is. But we should think whether it should be applied in Hariyomal’s case. Since you know more facts about this matter than I, you may attach what weight you think my opinion deserves and do only what seems right to you.
 For Anandi and Mani, follow Dr. Kanuga’slibtech_363_footnoteadvice. I cannot say that taking milk has benefited my elbow in any way.
 Think very carefully over the article about prayerlibtech_364_footnotewhich I am sending with this. You will find it very easy to understand. If you understand it, you will also be able to explain its meaning to others. I see from my experience that, instead of our time being wasted in that way, our mind seems to become lighter and we feel less the burden of work or responsibility. These days I think frequently about prayer, and especially about individual prayer. Rambhalibtech_365_footnotehad taught   me  to pray when I was a mere child, and so prayer has become a most natural thing for me. But I still see short-comings in me. If perfect wakefulness is achieved, the grandeur of that state would make
 
 everything else seem meaningless.

  LETTER TO NARMADABEHN RANA 
 July 16, 1932
 CHI. NARMADA,
 If what has been written to me on your behalf is true, that does you credit. No human being can protect your chastity. You alone can do that. And if you have complete faith in God, you may rest assured that it will be protected. Ask the women in the Ashram to explain to you the meaning of the first versein the women’s prayer. Though the prayer was addressed by Draupadi, it is meant for all women. Don’t look upon it as merely the prayer of a woman one or two thousand years ago. It can protect, like a shield, [the honour of] any woman who is in distress.
 I cannot advise you from here whether you should go to a court or not. I cannot even decide that. I must know all the relevant circumstances. On this matter, therefore, you should follow the advice of somebody whom you trust. But in any case you must have confidence in your mind that, no matter where you are taken and kept, you can protect your chastity without anybody’s help. You may be certain that such confidence will give you the necessary strength. If, however, you have resolved to live as a virgin for your whole life, you should study further and keep your mind engaged in some work of service.

 Received your letter. See what I have written in Narandas’s letterlibtech_367_footnotelibtech_368_footnoteregarding Narmada. In such matters I cannot give any advice from here. Where a pleader requires to be consulted, he should be consulted. This is wisdom. After that if the Ashram  has  to  do anything, Narandas has full authority, He may do whatever his duty dictates. See the letter I am writing to Narmada.

  INDIVIDUAL PRAYER 
 July 17, 1932
 Though I have already written once on this subject,libtech_369_footnotelibtech_370_footnoteI feel that I should again write something about its importance. It seems to me that one reason why people feel no interest in community prayers may be that they do not realize the necessity of individual prayer. The idea of community prayers arose from the individual’s need for prayer. If individuals do not feel such a need, how can a  community? Community prayers also are for the benefit of individuals. They help people in their effort to attain knowledge of the self—for self- purification; It is, therefore, necessary that all of us should understand the importance of individual prayer, As soon as a child learns to understand things, its mother ought to teach it to pray. This practice is common to all religions.
 There are at least two clear times for such prayer, that is, we should turn our mind to the Lord within immediately on awakening in the morning and when closing our eyes for sleep in the evening. During the rest of the day, every man and woman who is spiritually awake will think of God when doing anything and do that with Him as witness. Such a person will never do anything evil, and a time will
 
 come when he or she will think every thought with God as witness and as its Master. This will be a state in which one will have reduced oneself to a cipher. Such a person, who lives constantly in the sight of God, will every moment feel Rama dwelling in his heart.
 For such prayers, no special mantra or bhajan is necessary. Though generally a mantra is recited at the commencement and conclusion of every religious act, that is not at all necessary. We have only to turn our thoughts to God, no matter by what name we call Him, by what method and in what condition. Very few form such a habit. If most people followed this practice, there would be less sin and evil in this world and our dealings with one another would be pure. In order that we may attain such a pure state, everybody should pray at least at the two times which I have mentioned. Each person may fix other hours, too, according to his convenience, and gradually increase their frequency so that, ultimately his every breath will be accompanied with Ramanama.
 Such individual prayer consumes no time at all. It requires not time but wakefulness. As we don’t feel that the unceasing action of blinking consumes any time, so also we do not feel that praying inwardly does. But we are aware that the eye-lids are doing their work; similarly prayer should go on constantly in our heart. Anybody who wishes to pray in this manner should know that he cannot do with an impure heart. He must, therefore, banish all impurity from his heart when praying. As one feels ashamed of doing anything wicked when being observed by somebody, so also should one feel ashamed of acting similarly in the sight of God. But God watches every action and knows every thought of ours. Hence there can be no moment when we can do anything or think any thought unobserved by Him. Thus, anybody who prays to God with his heart will in the end become filled with Him and so become sinless.

  	I got your letter. It does not answer all my questions. I cannot 	remember now your replies to my questions put to you orally, It 	would not be proper for me to write anything on the basis of [my 
 impression of ] your replies. That is why I put down the questions in writing. But I will not trouble you further. I shall see what I can do on the basis of the material you have supplied. The description which you have given of your condition is sad, but I do not despair. I am confident that you are vigilant. And since you are also striving to the best of your ability, I should like you to have trust that you will get some day the required strength. If you lose faith in yourself, other people’s faith is hardly to help you.
 All three of us keep well. We spend a good deal of our time in studies.

         CHI. 	PREMA,   LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK   July 	17, 1932 
  	Should we not believe that you are unlucky? I sent the birthday 	blessings  by return of post, but the letterlibtech_372_footnoteitself was held back here. I don’t know if it was 	posted yesterday. What good do blessings     
 conveyed in a letter do? You should be satisfied if my heart showered blessings on you, which it certainly did. We never know how a person feels in his heart. It is the heart which matters; all else is false.
 You must cure the pain in your back. It can have some connection with your monthly periods. Are they normal? I feel the same doubt about Anandi; Mani and Mangala. Talk with the girls and find out. It is probably time for Mani to begin to have menses. I remember that she was three years old when she was brought to the Ashram. She should be sixteen now. Mangala, too, may be of the same age. Know from them all the facts.
 If any of the women who have joined the Ashram recently can write, ask them to write to me. Get into close contact with Narmada. Her story is a painful one.
 I do not know the life of President Wilson. I am told that he was a good man and that his motives were sincere.
 The last War seems to have done no good. Moral bonds have weakened and hatred has increased. The war mentality is not less strong today than it was before the War and the lure of power and pelf has become stronger.
 We can certainly pray for some person or with a material aim, and such prayer may even be rewarded. But prayer which is inspired by no such motive is probably more beneficial to the atman and the world. Prayer produces an effect on oneself, that is, it awakens further the Indwelling Spirit and, as the latter becomes more and more awakened, the area of its influence becomes wider. What I have said above about the heart is applicable here. Prayer is a matter of the heart. Saying it aloud and similar other activities are intended to awaken the heart. The Infinite Power which exists outside us also exists inside us and is equally infinite there. The body is no obstacle to Its operation. The obstacle is created by us. Prayers remove that obstacle. We do not know in any particular instance whether or not our prayers have answered our wish. If I pray for Narmada to be delivered from her suffering and if she becomes free from it, I should not assume that that was the result of my prayer. Such prayer is never in vain, but we do not know how it bears fruit. Moreover, when the effect for which we had prayed follows, we need not believe that it is necessarily for our good. In this matter, too, we should follow the path shown in the Gitabodh. Prayers should be offered in a spirit of non- attachment. Even when we have prayed for some person, we can
 remain, unconcerned with the result. We may pray for a person to be delivered from his suffering because we think that is for his good, but we should remain unconcerned whether or not he becomes free. Because the effect is the opposite of what we had prayed for, we need not believe that our prayers have not been answered. Tell me if you want me to explain the matter still further.
 Remember about the list of Urdu books which I have asked you to send. It is quite uncertain now when you will get this letter and when I shall get your reply. We should however cultivate and feel certainty in the midst of uncertainty.

         DEAR 	DEVDAS,   LETTER TO DEVDAS GANDHI     July 	17, 1932 
  	Received your letter dated 30th June, written on the back of the 	Urdu letter of Hamid Ali, yesterday noon, that is, on the 16th July, 	Nowadays my post has become very irregular. It comes to me after 	taking a big round. It must be said to be my good fortune that I get 	it in spite of that—what rights a prisoner has? Imprisonment means 	absence of rights. As I take the meaning of imprisonment to be this 	I can keep my mind steady. Similar is the case with visits. For the 	most part you will be able to see Mahadev. But there cannot be 	prepared a timetable as you think. Either you should take the risk 	of not being granted an interview or you should give up the  desire  	of  visiting him. I would have been glad no doubt to see you and 	Lakshmi if I could, but the step taken by me certainly seems to be 	proper. Ba will feel the shock the most. But she is born to endure 	shocks. All those who form or keep connections with me must pay a 	heavy price. It can be said that Ba has to pay the heaviest. I have 	this much satisfaction that Ba has lost nothing by it.libtech_373_footnote As 	soon as I received a telegram about Varadachari I also wired    
 to himlibtech_374_footnoteI also wrote letters. I got receipt of my   wire  also  by  wire through Rajaji. Yesterday I received a letter from Lakshmi to that effect; in it there is no receipt of my letterlibtech_375_footnoteon the subject. But my post about that time went the wrong way.
 None of us had the idea that you are to be released in September. It does not seem that you will be transferred from there, though I got a detailed report of your health from H.E. the Governor. I hope that your health will not suffer now. The presence of Hanumanprasad proved to be much peace- giving to me. I find from Hamid Ali’s letter that he had sent Ramacharcha also. I am reading it.  I read the stories about martyred lad, agriculture, alchemist, etc. It is true that I could not understand some words. Otherwise there was no difficulty. I have not got yet the booklibtech_376_footnotelibtech_377_footnoteon   arogya,  i.e.,  sanitation, from anywhere. It will be better if Al-Faruk is not received from Delhi. We had a copy in the Ashram. I have asked for it. I will read it after I finish Ramacharcha I like it. I now remember to have read it before. I find the meanings I had noted down in it. It is not wrong if this book is read two-three times. You must be writing to Hamid Ali and others in English. You must form a habit to write in Urdu. My idea is to write a short letter in Urdu to him. His handwriting  resembles that of a professional writer. He must be a professional writer. We have lost the art of writing. It is still preserved in Urdu.
 The reason why I am taking milk is the (persuasion of the) Superintendent of this place. He was disturbed and my  health  had  a little bit given way and hence I am taking milk. There was no necessity for it. It was  likely  that  the  health  would  become  nor-  mal soon. But I thought it wise not to carry on experiments here. I do not see any benefit of taking milk in particular for the present. The weight which had gone down had increased, that is, it is 105libtech_378_footnote lb. It had
 gone to 103 lb. I do not see any effect of taking milk on the hand. The pain was already there when I was taking milk. But this pain cannot be said to afflict me. Because it aches only when the elbow is given a particular movement. When that movement is stopped there is no pain. Such movement is (almost) stopped. There is no cause for anxiety at all.
 
 Vallabhbhai has begun spinning on the  Gandiva  spinning- wheel and also the study of Sanskrit. When he heard that Rajaji was studying it, he became enthusiastic over it. He has begun the study in right earnest. He had sent for the  24  parts  of  Satavlekar’s  guide.  He has finished (in six days) the first part thereof. Now he is reading the second  part.  His  study  is  going  on  very  briskly.  The  books by Satavlekar are on the whole good. They are easy to learn. Perhaps you must have seen and read them also. My study of Urdu, astronomy and political economy is going on. At intervals I read some relig- ious books also. As for instance I read Vaidik Vinay of Abhay Sharma.libtech_379_footnotelibtech_380_footnoteNow I am reading a book called  Swadhyaya Samhita.libtech_381_footnotelibtech_382_footnoteIt contains selections from the Vedas and other books, and below them there is translation  in  Hindi.  Mahadev  is  learning  French and  reads something else also. He writes for me if there is anything. He devotes one hour for Vallabhbhai. He also cooks bread for me. I take bread instead of the bread from the bakery. There is no chaff in the bread from the bakery, while it is contained in the bread prepared at home. That is the reason of going back to the roti. I am writing letters with my own hand because mostly while observing silence  I  am writing letters. I also get most of them written (by someone). Whatever I  write I  do not feel any difficulty in writing with my  right  hand.  I am not allowed to write with the left hand, and hence I use the right hand. I am writing the history of the Ashram during leisure.libtech_383_footnotelibtech_384_footnoteI hope to finish it in a short time. I am spinning on the Magan spinning- wheel.
 Jalbhai Naoroji can now move about. He has escaped just from death.
 I have returned Rajaji’s letter to you. I am wondering about your letter dated 2nd June. I will cause a search to be made here again.Whatever (blessings) you like from my companions.

  	I thought you would never fall ill, then how is it that you fell ill 	again? You do not write letters now. Do you like to stay at the 	Ashram? Why did you come away from Mother? Write to me everything in 	detail. Write also openheartedly what your desires are.  BAPU  Bombay 	Secret Abstracts, Home Department, Special Branch File No. 800 (40) 	(3), Pt. II p. 311   
         DEAR 	ANANDI,   LETTER TO ANANDI     July 	17, 1932 
  	It seems you are again down with fever. Why do you not find out the 	cause? Now you are taking Dr. Kanuga’s pills. Let me know what is 	their effect. You must continue to write whether you receive mine or 	not.  BAPU  Bombay 	Secret Abstracts, Home Department, Special Branch File No. 800 (40) 	(3), Pt. II p. 311   
         CHI. 	SHARDA,   LETTER TO SHARDA C . SHAH     July 	17, 1932 
  	We do not know if people meditated upon Bharata and Rama during 	their lifetime. Experience tells us that people are worshipped only 	after their death. It is a different thing that they are honoured 	while they are still alive. We may not call it dhyanalibtech_401_footnotelibtech_402_footnoteA 	living human being can certainly not be regarded as perfect. And, 	worship and dhyana would be appropriate only with reference 	to perfect beings. It would be harmful to worship one who has faults 	or who is likely to do something wrong, for we would become like 	those whom we     
 meditate. I do not have the power nor the wish to perform miracles as Christ did. How can there be any comparison between him and me? He was a very great man indeed. Write to Bhai that he should write to me.
 You must conitinue to put on weight.
 Do you not realize the difference between the bodily structure of man and woman? Whatever differences you see can be seen, one may say, with the naked eye. A man has moustaches, a woman has none. A woman bears children, a man does not. A woman suckles her child, a man does not. Are these differences not plain enough to be clear to everyone? And this means a little difference in their functions and training.

   LETTER TO CHHOTUBHAI    DEAR 	CHHOTUBHAIlibtech_403_footnote,    July 	17, 1932 
  	Received your letter. If just now you continue to remain at the 	Ashram for looking after your father, then there will be no 	objection to his staying there; otherwise I am of opinion that the 	Ashram will not be able to look after him and at such a time such a 	burden should not be allowed to fall on the Ashram. After thinking 	over the account received from you about his constipation, I see 	only one remedy and it is that unless he observes 10-15 fasts at a 	stretch, his stomach will not be cleansed. But only he and you can 	say if he has strength to do so. His strength does not mean his 	bodily strength, but his strength of mind. Even if he observes fast, 	some treatment must be taken side by side, that is, drinking a good 	deal of water and taking enema daily.  	It does not seem that your father knows how to write, because the 	whole letter has been written by you. And so I do not write 	separately to him.

  	Devdas has sent your letter to me for perusal.  I  am  grateful  to 	you for the books sent to me. I am  still  reading  Ramacharcha  	(i. e., life of Rama). I have finished other books. All 	the three books have pleased me.  There  was  not  much  difficulty 	in  underst- anding them. Please do not send Al-Faruq ( life 	of Faruq, the 2nd Caliph of Islam) as I have got it with me (here). 	But do send some other books which in your opinion may be quite all 	right for me. Convey vandemataram to all the brothers of the 	Jamia.

MY DEAR CHILD,
  LETTER TO ESTHER MENON 
 
 July 18, 1932
  	I have your letter. Do not fret, if you don’t hear from me at the 	expected moment. My correspondence has been upset a bit. I am hoping 	that the matter will be soon put right. However, a prisoner has got 	to be satisfied with facilities that may be given to him for the 	natural satisfaction of his healthy wants.  	When you see the invalid sister, you must tell her I often think of  	 her.   I   wonder   if   you   ever   visit   that   little   	schoollibtech_406_footnotelibtech_407_footnotein   your neighbourhood for defective children. I 	thought the institution had earnest workers. If you have the time, I 	would like you to know more of the institution and its managers and 	tell me how it progresses.  	You tell me how desolate Bajaj’s house looked for want of the 	woman’s touch. I have always considered this a result of our false 	notions of division of work between men and women. Division there 	must be. But this utter helplessness on the man’s part when it 	comes to keeping a household in good order and woman’s 	helplessness when it comes to be a matter of looking after herself 	(more here than in the West) are due to erroneous upbringing. Why 	should man be so lazy as not to keep his house neat, if there is no 	woman looking after it, or why should a woman feel that she always 	needs a man protector? This anomaly seems to me to be due to the 	habit of regarding woman as fit primarily for housekeeping and of 	thinking that she must live so soft as to feel weak and be always in 	need of protection. We are trying to create a different atmosphere 	at the Ashram. It is difficult work. But it seems to be worth doing. Remember 	me and Mahadev to Mrs. Winston when you write to 
 her.   Kisses 	to the children. Love.        BAPU

To ply the takli does not mcan 	drawing out a thread. But it is drawing 160 yards of yarn of at 	least 12 counts of uniform twist per hour so that there may be no 	difficulty in weaving. One should not have even any confidence about 	letters from one in jail. Your letter came to my hand today, that 	is, fourteen days after you wrote it. It remains to be seen when 	this reaches you. In these circumstances there is no meaning in my 	replying by return of post. But your vow is such that you must have 	adhered to it on the ground of not receiving my letter. This will 	certainly do you good. And if you can pull on without tea and sugar 	for so many days, how can you not do without them for ever? We know 	from the lives of crores (of people) in this world that both these 	things are unnecessary, inasmuch as they are acquainted neither with 	tea nor sugar. About jail life: the life of one in jail cannot be 	written at length. But to the    
 prisoners whose mind is innocent this life happens to be peaceful and elevating.

   LETTER TO S. D. SATAVLEKAR      BHAI 	SATAVLEKAR,     July 	19, 1932 
  	I got your  letter only today.  The Sanskrit Readers  came earlier 	but I was awaiting your letter. May I thank you for  the Readers? I 	have received so many books from you ! Purushartha and other 	things keep coming. You will be gratified to learn that Sardar  has  	completed  the  first  two  Readers  and  has  gone on  to the 	third. We are jotting down the errors that come to our notice. We 	had already decided to inform you of them even  before  the receipt 	of your letter. There is no doubt that on the whole the Readers are 	very well planned. Whatever mistakes we observe will be pointed out 	to you only with the purpose of enhancing the utility of the series.  	My arm does not give too much pain. The left elbow pains only with a 	particular movement. The Superintendent gave me Lakshadi oil 	to be used for massage but it did no good. In fact, this oil helps 	only when the pain is caused by rheumatism but the pain in my elbow 	joint is not reheumatic. So far the doctors have diagnosed it as the 	result of constant employment of the elbow in plying the charkha. 	For that reason I have given up using the left arm in spinning for 	almost a month. It cannot be said that it has resulted in any 	improvement. So now I am to undergo intensive treatment. There is no 	cause for worry; my health is, on the whole, good enough.  What 	 you  have written about Vishwaroopadarshanayogalibtech_409_footnoteis quite 	correct, but it does not in any way contradict what I have written    
 in the prefacelibtech_410_footnotelibtech_411_footnoteto that chapter. The man who sees the whole world as a manifestation of Vasudeva is bound to have a vision of the Cosmic Form but the Form will be that of his own imagining. A Christian who considers the creation as a divine manifestation  will  visualize  an image to suit his notions. Our way of worship determines the form of God in our mind. One born and bred in the Hindu culture will never tire of reading the eleventh chapter and if he be a devotee, he will be able to picture to himself the magnificent form described therein. Such imagery is not beyond a man’s imagination in this world. We may call the divine force as Brahman, Atman or Vasudeva, yet it remains formless. Only for the devotee it acquires dimensions; that is its expression and therein lies its poetic appeal. We can make only one deduction  which  you  have  already  drawn.  We  must  be  able  to   see Vasudeva or God even in a dacoit. When we have acquired the strength to do that, the  dacoit  will  give  up  his  wickedness.  And until we acquire this power all our learning and knowledge  is worthless. You have not expected my comments upon your writing on Vishwaroopadarshana, yet I have written all this as I am engrossed with the same thoughts. It gives me great pleasure to carry on such conversations with you through letters.
 I have finished reading ‘Vaidik Vinay’ by Abhayji. Now I am reading Swadhyaya Samhita by Vaidikmuni Hariprasadji. But I find great difficulty in reading the Vedic hymns. You are acquainted with my knowledge of Sanskrit, it is of the most elementary order, and as regards Vedic Sanskrit it is almost nil. I know this much, that vedic hymns have been interpreted in several ways by different scholars— by Sanatanis in one way, by Arya Samajists in another and by Western scholars in yet another. Even among the sanatanis I find difference of opinion. All Arya Samajists too are not agreed upon the same meaning. You must be remembering the correspondence between yourself  and Vaidyaji that I initiated.libtech_412_footnotelibtech_413_footnoteIn the light of all this I feel bewildered when I try to study the Vedic hymns and find myself at a loss to decide upon any interpretation. At present I am memorizing Ishopanishad. I think Shankara’s interpretation of it differs from that of Aurobindo Babu; and your interpretation that I saw last year while in jail differs from both. I have now received a translation in Gujarati. This and Hariprasadji’s translation are again at variance. I have
 
 understood this Upanishad in my own way which seems somewhat presumptuous in view of my scanty knowledge of Sanskrit. Is there any work available from which I may learn the rudiments of Vedic grammar and does a collection exist containing different annotations by various scholars? In short, what should a man like myself do when confronted with interpreting correctly the Vedic mantras? I have not faith enough in any sect to accept their interpretation as gospel truth. Luckily or unluckily I possess just enough knowledge of Sanskrit to choose from several interpretations available to me. But I have no desire to collect a large library while I am in jail nor do I wish to involve myself in a deep study. Gita suffices for my own contentment. But I do like to dabble in the Vedas. Therefore please oblige me by giving whatever information you can. We are all well.
 Yours,
 MOHANDAS

   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI     CHI. 	NARANDAS,    July 	20, 1932 
  	Your letter, posted on the 18th, reached me on the 20th. But I don’t 	know what will happen to mine. The officials here tell me that the 	packet which I had handed over on the 4th was dispatched on the 	16th. All the letters are sent to the Secretariat for censoring, and 	are posted when received back here after being passed. I simply 	cannot understand why they should do this. I have been trying to 	find out, of course. I don’t know if I shall succeed. We should go 	on writing to each other as usual and not worry when the letters 	will reach their destination. We should not think about the matter 	at all. We should be ready in our minds to face the possibility of 	the correspondence stopping altogether and be sure that we shall not 	feel upset even then.  	Ask Prabhudas to write to me. Two days ago the doctor permitted me 	to rotate the Gandiva wheel with the left hand, and so I have 	started spinning on the Gandiva. I appreciate it all the more after 	my experience with the Magan spinning-wheel. My yarn became fine 	immediately and the threads also snapped rarely. I still  draw  the 	thread with the right hand. There are some defects in the spinning- 	wheel, and when I have removed them it will work still more 	smoothly. 
 Comparing it with the Magan spinning-wheel, I see that I cannot acquire speed on the latter. Hence I think that for spinning with one spindle only, the Gandiva or the ordinary spinning-wheel is better. For anybody who cannot use either of his hands for drawing the thread or for rotating the wheel, the Magan spinning-wheel is an invaluable invention. Obviously, anyone who can use both his hands can spin more. But we cannot spin yarn of the highest count on it. A few changes may perhaps help us to do it. It is also possible that our speed on it may increase if we make some modificatons so that we can spin on it with one spindle only. But all this requires experimentation. My experience of it in its present form is what I have described it to be. I can say that I have now acquired excellent control over the pedals.
 I have been permitted to spin on the Gandiva wheel not because there is any improvement in the condition of my elbow but because complete rest has not benefited it in any way. The assumption behind this is that the pain may not have been caused by the  strain  of [rotating] the wheel when spinning. I shall know for certain in a few days.
 I am happy that Dr. Talwalkar charges two rupees for conveyance and gives a bill for the medicines. If we call him only once or twice in a year, he can afford to charge us nothing, but he cannot afford to do so when he gives us medicines as frequently as he does. He is not so rich. As for conveyance, I think we have been paying it for a long time. Dr. Talwalkar’s sending us bills for medicines is likely to have one result. Through laxity we may have been calling him during all this time even when it might not be necessary. If that is so, our laxity should go now.In any case, if we are scrupulous in following dharma, we should feel extremely reluctant to accept anybody’s free services. But most people certainly do not behave in that way. Because water costs nothing, we use it freely and do not feel ashamed in doing so. On the contrary, we ask why we should not use it freely when it costs nothing. And as we are careless about using water because it costs nothing, we feel in the same way about other services or things which we get free. This is a violation of our vow of nonstealing, besides being a violation of the vow  of ahimsa too.
 I have had no letter from Ba. I wrote one letter to her many days ago, to which I got no reply. And so I have not written to her recently.
 
 I simply do not understand what happens to these letters. I will write once again to her, and put the letterlibtech_414_footnotewith this. If you get it, show it to the Jail Superintendent there and give it to Ba. I hope all those who had got cold have recovered now. There is a wire from Devdas informing me that he had a mild relapse of fever. If you get this letter and if Shanti is there at the time, give him and his wife my blessings and tell him that I was happy that he had gone there. Did he get my letter? I wrote it to him at Rajkot.
 It will be enough if you send the slivers, given by Chhakkaddas, to Dahyabhai with anybody who may be going to that side. I have a stock of other slivers with me. It will not matter, therefore, if Chhakkaddas’s arrive a little late.
 Is Parnerkar’s health all right? I am sure Prithurajlibtech_415_footnotelibtech_416_footnoteis quite well. It seems to me from your description that Shankarbhai had a narrow escape. Anyone falling from the roof of the kitchen is hardly
likely to survive, as the roof is at a fairly good height. I hope his arm
is all right now.
 I have fully explained my views regarding Sitala Sahay in a previous letter.libtech_417_footnoteYou will know what they are if you get it. I have also written about Parnerkar’s mother,libtech_418_footnoteas also about Narmada.libtech_419_footnote
 The Jailor informed us that Mahadev’s letter to Durga, written on the 11th, was posted on the 14th. But you had not got it till the 18th, from which it seems that the letters are being tampered with there too.
 You should assume that for some time now you  cannot  be certain of getting my letters—as for the future, let us wait and see what happens. You will find more about this in my letter to Premabehn.libtech_420_footnote

   LETTER TO DEVDAS GANDHI     MY 	DEAR DEVDAS,    July 	21, 1932 
  	The telegram from Hanumanprasadji today causes anxiety. It seems 	that there is an attack of fever again. It is stated in the telegram 	that the attack is a mild one. Hence I believe that by the time you 	get this letter you must have completely recovered. You must  have 	received the letter (I) wrote before this. Still there is no 	certainty about the post dispatched by me. It seems that my letters 	take many days to get through (the scrutiny). The letters are being 	nicely scrutinized. You must be certainly careful of your health. 	Whatever the climate, I believe that it can be kept under control by 	effecting suitable changes in the diet. Write to me why there was a 	set-back again.    
 It seems that I get my post regularly again. We all three are happy. Vallabhbhai is learning Sanskrit like an industrious school- boy. He devotes many hours to its study. He has finished two parts and is reading the third. There will be no wonder if he finishes all the
 24 parts within four or five months at this rate. Yet, it will be considered a wonder and a miracle if he begins to understand the Mahabharata and the Ramayana in original.

  	I am in receipt of your letter.libtech_430_footnotelibtech_431_footnoteI 	have heard many interpretations of the occult significance of the 	sacred thread. But all these interpretations are only guesses. I do 	not think that all these ideas were present at the time when the 	sacred thread came into use.  Those people who described themselves 	as Aryans adopted the use of the sacred thread in order to 	distinguish between Aryans and non-Aryans. This must have happened 	at the time when the art of making cloth from cotton was discovered. 	Crores of people merely put on the dhoti then, as they do even now, 	with the rest of the body uncovered. In any case those who are 	believed to be non-Aryans did so. The Aryans, therefore, adopted the 	symbol of the sacred thread in order to encourage and improve the 	art of spinning and prove that it  was sacred work. I have no 	evidence from history in support of this statement. It is only my 	conjecture. Today there is no distinction— and there ought not to 	be any—between Aryans and non-Aryans. An admixture of blood 	between the races took place thousands of years      
 ago and the present inhabitants of India are the progeny of such an admixture. If the sacred thread is to be worn to all, all [the castes] should have the right to wear it. I see no meaning  in  such a movement. For this reason, after giving up the use of the sacred thread I never tried to wear it again nor do I wish to do so. Inasmuch as the practice of wearing the sacred thread is likely to have created the distinction between higher and lower castes, it should be discarded. I would advise Gauri Prasad to give up his infatuation for the sacred thread. It is the sign of a brahmachari. If a person observes brahmacharya that itself is the best sacred thread. Why is a cotton thread needed?libtech_432_footnote
 To keep the water in a  well clean  it  should  be  covered  with  a wire-netting. There ought not to be any dirt anywhere around it. The well should be deep and (a certain quantity of) “permanganate of potash” or chlorine should be put into it every month. The quantity (of the drug) to be used should be ascertained from a doctor. In addition to taking these precautions it would be advisable to get the water analysed from time to time.

 The man who resorts to falsehood with a view to acquiring worldly goods or for some other reason in full of attachment and hatred;  he  cannot  possibly  reach  God.libtech_436_footnotelibtech_437_footnoteAnd  I  consider  the  other example you have cited as impossible. To tread the path of truth and at the same time to remain aloof from worldly affairs, i.e., from  pravritti is a thing which is impossible like a flower in the sky. How can one tell what path one follows who keeps away from pravritti? To tread the truth in itself involves entrance into pravritti.  Without  pravritti there is no occasion for treading or not treading the path of truth. The holy Gita in its several verses has made it clear that a man cannot exist even for a moment without pravritti. The difference between a devotee and one who is not a devotee is this, that the first remains in pravritti with an eye to the highest good and while living in pravritti never lets go his hold upon truth and weakens attachments and aversions, while the other lives in a state of infatuation with

 pravritti and does not even try to remain aloof from such demoniac actions as falsehood, etc., while pursuing his object. These worldly affairs are not a thing to be looked upon with contempt. It is only through worldly affairs that a vision of the Lord is possible. Those worldly affairs that create infatuation deserve to be looked upon with contempt and always shunned. This is my firm opinion and experience.

I have a postcard from the 	Ashram telling me that my letter of 5th July was received there on 	20th instant! The letters writtenon the 12th and 19th July have 	still evidently not been sent. They contain important instructions 	about ailing inmates and others in distress that has nothing to do 	with political matters.  If  the Government do not wish to withdraw 	their orders conveyed to me about my letters, I should be assured of 	their quick despatch. This delay in sending my letters to their 	destination seems to me to be highly unjust to me and hardly 	becoming for the Government. I have willingly broken no rule about 	my correspondence.

  LETTER TO NANDUBEHN B. KANUGA 
 July 22, 1932
 DEAR SISTER,
 
 When I was thinking of writing a letter to you, letters began to rain from you, maybe, on the Sardar. It may rain for any reason, but it must make all wet. The same is the case with us.
 I knew that you were of a humorous nature, but I knew only from your letter that you were overflowing with humour. You ask for my blessings, but they are always there.
 You have been encouraging the Sardar well, but he is not a soft Bania like me. When he is inspired with courage from the heart, then only he will do what he wants to do. That is the case. Now he is enthusiastic over the study of Sanskrit, i.e., he has fully devoted himself to it. But there is no one here who can take creditlibtech_451_footnotefor that. His teacher is Mahadev. In addition, comes the Gandiva spinning-wheel.
 \That also when it occurred to him. So the intentions you have formed to go shares with him are useless. Yes, you can take the share you want from his knowledge of Sanskrit. If you say, we may send the same by wire.
 What a shame that a doctor becomes toothless as I am. Tell Haribhailibtech_452_footnotethat [the question is] when doctors become ill in whom we should have faith.
 
 
 You and Lilavatibehn have lost, it seems, a good deal of your weight.

         CHI. 	KAKA,   LETTER TO D. B. KALELKAR     July 	23, 1932 
  	I have received you letter after waiting for a long time. As it is 	heavily censored, I have not been able to get full news about your 	health. I have of course written to Colonel Doyle about your health. 	I have suggested to him that he should send you to me, in which case 	your health will of course improve and we could also study astronomy 	and even write about it.  	My suggestion is twofold. Either Shankerlibtech_453_footnoteand/or Ballibtech_454_footnoteshould be sent to you, or you should be sent to me. 	Shanker is here. He of course wishes to be near you and serve you. I 	have no direct communication from Bal but I keep getting news about 	him and the other boys. Someone or another writes from Visapur. About 	astronomy my intention and purpose was as you had     
 inferred. It was not in my mind that astronomy helps one to know the hour of the night by looking at the stars, nor was I thinking that the Vedic gods and goddesses are directly connected with planets, stars and constellations. I am familiar with Bhai Hiralal’s ideas. I have read all the articles he sent me. All that is interesting. But my interest is of quite a different kind.
 Looking at the sky  the  impression  we  get  of infinity,  of purity, of order and of grandeur is one that purifies us.  It  may perhaps be that on being able to reach the planets and the stars one will get the same experience of good and evil that one gets here on earth. But truly divine is the peaceful influence of their beauty and coolness at this great distance. Also when once we  are  able  to establish communion with the heavens it does not matter where we may happen to be. It then becomes like receiving the Ganga in one’s own  home.  All  these  thoughts  have   made   me   a   keen   watcher of the infinite skies. So I am acquiring knowledge of astronomy enough for my own satisfaction. At present I have gathered quite a collection of books on the subject. Professor Trivedi has sent me three bookslibtech_455_footnotelibtech_456_footnoteby James Jeans. Of them I have read the two bigger ones. I like them both. I have now started a systematic study of astronomy. At present I am reading a book by Kharas. The author, it seems, has taken a good deal of trouble over it. The book is profusely illustrated, which is great help. I find this book interesting because I have already read other books. Had I begun with this book I may not perhaps have liked it. No effort has been made to make it entertaining.
 I cannot, as yet, write to you about the kind of book on astronomy which I want in Gujarati, as my ideas on the subject are still taking shape; it would be neither easy nor desirable to indicate a framework at this stage.
 It is quite all right that your spinning is reduced. Nothing need be done at the risk of your health.
 Vallabhbhai has added to his work of preparing envelopes. He spins ten slivers every day on the Gandiva spinning-wheel and is immersed in the study of Sanskrit. We have sent for all the 24 parts of Satavlekar’s series. It is about a fortnight that he started the study and is already finishing the first three parts. This is really good progress. He will probably finish all the parts in four or five months. He aspires
 
 
 to know enough Sanskrit to be able to read the Ramayana and the
 Mahabharata.
 Mahadev has reduced his spinning by half. Too much time was taken up in spinning yarn of 40 counts. It was also very tiring for him. His yarn of 40 counts turns out to be very good.
 I can’t say that my left elbow is completely cured; but with the doctor’s permission I have gone back from the Magan spinning- wheel to the Gandiva. But I turn the wheel with my left hand and draw the thread with the right. I haven’t sufficient control of the right hand to draw a thread as fine as I would like to. But even then, the thread is finer than the one I could draw on the Magan wheel. My speed also has somewhat increased, and if my left elbow does not betray me, my speed must increase a good deal. I visualize a tug of war between my speed and the fineness of the yarn.
 These   days,  Satyagrahashramno  Itihas libtech_457_footnotetakes   up   my   time. I do not feel like writing anything else before the history is finished. The study of Urdu and of the currency problem and Swadhyaya Samhita are of course going on. I may not, therefore, be tempted to write on the characteristics of  daivi  sampatlibtech_458_footnotelibtech_459_footnote.  The  idea  is  yours and I think it is proper that you yourself should write on the subject.
 The history of the Ashram is taking a strange shape. I find the task is also difficult. There is in it very little about individuals. I have explained what the Ashram observances are, and how they are being followed. Therein I have written at length on non-violence, varnashr- ama, bread-labour and brahmacharya. Perhaps the work will be finished in a fortnight. I am keeping your suggestionslibtech_460_footnotebefore me. But all your suggestions cannot be incorporated in it. I myself do not know what shape the history will take finally.

  SUPERVISION IS NOT NECESSARYlibtech_461_footnote 
 July 24, 1932
 This heading will probably shock the readers. I do not intend to suggest through it that we can manage our affairs at present without supervision. But I certainly wish to suggest a way of reducing its degree and doing away with it completely by and by.
 If supervision is thought necessary in an institution inspired by the ideals of dharma, to that extent it is deficient in dharma. Supervision implies distrust, and distrust kills the spirit of dharma, it kills the soul. God watches everybody. Why should we then watch anyone? Why should a person who has undertaken to cook or to clean lavatories not do the work carefully unless he is watched? Why should we not trust that he will do it carefully? We may not mind [a rule to the effect that] a person who does not do thoroughly the work which he has undertaken should leave the Ashram, but supervision ought to be unbearable to us. The total quantity of work each person does every day is sufficient supervision over him.
 We should understand the meaning of supervision here. A child does require supervision. It will not know how to do a thing, and should  be  taught  to  do  the  work  given  to  it.  Even   grown-ups who do not know how to do a particular thing will require, may even want, supervision. Really speaking, such supervision is not supervision, but is guidance by a teacher. Novices are able to go forward in their work through the confidence which such guidance gives them.
 But the supervision which is a form of watching in order to know whether or not the other person is doing his work properly is blameworthy. Such supervision even over children is a bad thing. We should discover some means of doing away with this blameworthy practice.
 This is the first step towards that goal: we should make a list of the activities in which supervision is maintained and note the persons who are working in them. The matter should be discussed with them and they should then be left to their sense of honour. The manager of the Ashram and all the others should fully realize the God watches everything. Children, too, should realize right from now that God is present everywhere. This is not a superstition or a matter of doubt. It

 is as much a fact as our own existence is to ourselves.
 Everybody should think carefully over this suggestion It is our moral duty to put it into practice to the utmost extent possible.

          DEAR 	COL. DOYLE,   LETTER TO E.E. DOYLElibtech_462_footnote      July 	24, 1932 
  	Since writing to youlibtech_463_footnoteabout my correspondence, Major Bhan- dari has showed me 	the Government’s letter to you on the subject.  	I must confess that the letter has come upon me as a shock. It 	betrays, if I understand it rightly, want of confidence in Indian 	officials as a class and, naturally therefore, a disregard of the 	great languages of the country spoken by the millions of its 	inhabitants. The consequences of the policy are disastrous for those 	who have to suffer from it. Those who do not know English and cannot 	afford to pay for English assistance or who are too proud to avail 	themselves of it are at once put under a disadvantage. My own case 	is an instance in point. A friend  who  has  visited  my  ailing  	sonlibtech_464_footnotelibtech_465_footnotein  the  Gorakhpur Central Jail tells me that he is 	anxiously awaiting my letter. I did write to him. But he had not got 	the letter at the time the friend wrote. My son knows English, but 	we have never written to  each other  in English. My wife complains 	of the absence of my letters. She does not know English. I do not 	know what happens to her letters to me and mine to her. In my humble 	opinion the principal languages of      
 India are entitled to as much status at least as English, if not a greater.
 It hurts me to think that no Indian officials knowing the respective languages are considered fit or trustworthy enough to decide whether letters I write in Gujarati or Hindi or Urdu do or do not come within the passable limits. I have already in my letter of 22nd instant inquired if I have unwittingly given cause for the extraordinary scrutiny of my letters.
 The revised orders of the Government therefore by implication seem to take away the liberty they have given me for letter writing.
 Alike therefore for grounds of reason and sentiment, I would invite Government to reconsider their decision and so arrange as to ensure for my correspondence in the vernaculars the same quick despatch they promise for the English, If they whole-heartedly desire that I should continue to write letters as I have done hitherto.
 Yours sincerely,

  	There is not much difference between ‘bhai’ and ‘chi’. I do 	not remember how ‘Bhai’ came to be written or why I wrote it. I 	did not make the change intentionally.

So long as I am in jail, we need not 	think whether you can stay with me. If I am released some day you 	may ask me then. If I settle at some fixed place, I would certainly 	have you with me. My advice was not meant to stop you from asking 	questions but was intended to induce you to reflect. You must learn 	how to solve corollaries after knowing the principle. So long as we 	cannot do this, is cannot be said that we know the principle. This 	is like solving geometrical problems.

  LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK 
 July 24, 1932
  	I  got  your  letter.  I   cannot  say   how  long  I   shall   be   	able to continue writing letters. A sword is hanging over them. If 	the delay in clearing the letters from here continues, I see no 	benefit in writing them. Incoming letters are  now  handed  over  to 	 me  immediately. For outgoing letters, correspondence is going on. 	If these letters stop, you may assume that the train is off the 	rails. But that need not upset you or make  you  unhappy.  It  is  	for  the  Government  to  permit  me or not to permit me to write 	letters. A prisoner cannot demand such permission as a matter of 	right. The fact that I have been writing so long confers no right on 	me, and the loss of something over which one had no right should not 	make one unhappy.  	So you have now received my letterlibtech_475_footnotelibtech_476_footnoteconveying 	my blessings to you on the occasion of your birthday. Why should you 	mind that you got it late? Perhaps your getting it late has 	increased its value. You should not have taken it as an ill-omen 	when you did not get it. It is impossible that I would not send you 	my blessings though I had your letter asking for them. Why should 	you take it as an ill-omen if, because of unforeseen circumstances, 	you do not get the letter or get it late? Really speaking, there is 	no such thing as ill-omen for a person who has cultivated the spirit 	of non-attachment. Do not, therefore, believe for a single moment 	that this will be bad year for you. It will be bad only if we think 	bad thoughts or speak or do evil. And it is in our power not to do 	that.  	If it is the doctor’s opinion that you should get the tonsils 	removed, you should do so. Wasn’t his opinion the same when you 	consulted him before? The operation takes very little time. Nor have 	I heard that there is any risk in it. Your body ought to become 	completely free from disease. I believe that ultimately one is the 	best judge in regard to one’s body.  	Doctors have to depend much on what their petients tell them. This 	fact itself shows that, if the patient does not know what happens to 	his body, he cannot give correct replies to the doctor’s question. 	If you merely tell a doctor, “I have a headache”, what can he 	do? The    
 patient should know why he has got a headache. We can see that this is true about many other symptoms. The same argument applies to treatment. A doctor cannot know, if he is not told, what effect a particular medicine had. He has to depend on the patient for that. But all patients are not  able  to  understand  the  effects  of medicines. Food is a daily medicine for the body. What effect a particular food has on a person’s body, only he can understand. Hence, one who knows the effects of food, water and air on the human body will be able to preserve his health better than a doctor can over do for him. I believe, therefore, that all of us should acquire some general knowledge about the body, as also about air,  water  and  food.  We  do have the necessary literature for this purpose. We need not read all of it. If we read some of it,  that  would  be  enough  to  help us. Shivaji made his body very strong by his own efforts. Regarding myself, I am convinced that if I had not acquired sufficient knowledge for my purpose, I would have marched away long ago. This half broken body endures through my own care. I am sure that doctors have very little share in keeping it going.

 DEAR PRABHUDAS,
 Know (what I have written) about Magan spinning-wheel from letterlibtech_477_footnoteto Narandas.libtech_478_footnoteI have nothing to say about truth. It is difficult to define God. The definition of truth is enshrined in everyone’s heart. Whatever you believe at present to be true is truth and that is your God. If one lives in accordance with this truth felt in one’s heart, one is bound to reach the ultimate and pure truth, and that is  Paramatman.libtech_479_footnote. I am at present reading selections from the Vedas and there the same idea occurs. According to me, so long as we do not learn to live a truthful life, all reading is fruitless. Such a life has no room for anything which is not spontaneous. The votary of truth will
 
 
 appear as he is. There will be unity in his thought, speech and action. We learn this sooner if we regard God as truth. In order to live such a truthful life, we do not need to read many books. Everything depends on us. Reflect over this mantra: “The face of truth is covered by a golden lid. O sun, remove that so that I may see the Law of Truth.”libtech_480_footnote

  	I have preserved for you and Durga slips of coloured paper. It would 	be very good of course if the change to another plot agrees with 	you. Your weight must increase. If you get better there, then there 	will be no necessity for you to go to Bhowali. I regard it as a 	great improvement that your constipation has disappeared. What 	fruits can you get there? How much milk can you drink? How do you 	pass your time? What does Sheela do during the whole day? I 	have not received your father’s letter mentioned by you.

  	It is good that you have come to the Ashram; now stay (there) 	quietly. Does the Ashram water agree. (with you)? Do you receive any 	information about Gopaldas? How is his health? Write to me.  	I have not received at present any information about Balkr- ishna’s 	health. Is he still conducting the girls’ school?

If that is the case and the same 	state continues, he will undoubtedly be benefited. Of late I have no 	letter from Maganlal. Ratilallibtech_482_footnoteappears to be going on well at present. In his case 	changes—good and bad—will continue to take place.  	Thought my left elbow was confined in splints, there was no benefit. 	As it gives no trouble as long [as] it is not used in a particular 	way, I entertain no anxiety about it. The doctor here has been 	giving the treatment of diathermy at present. It has so far been 	treated thrice only and so nothing can be said about its effect. I 	hope you do not look to your shop overexerting yourself.

  LETTER TO KUSUM GANDHI 
 July 24, 1932
 
DEAR KUSUM (JUNIOR),
 You must be thoughtlessly speaking out too much. My post did not reach there and so you stopped writing, though you have written to me so often that you like to write to me every week. Do not speak anything hastily or thoughtlessly. Do not take a vow before thinking fully (about it). If (once) it is taken, remember it and observe it. Has your fever gone? What amount of milk can you take? If you want to be a nurse recover (from illness) soon and pass (your) life in meditation. By searching for the cause of everything any activity which we undertake becomes interesting and it does not appear to be burdensome.

  LETTER TO MATHURADAS TRIKUMJI 
 July 25, 1932
 CHI. MATHURADAS,
 Received your letter on the 23rd. It would be better if the weather there agrees (with you). Has any companion been given? Are sufficient clothes provided? I had received Popular  Astronomy.  I could not know who sent it. From the name in the book I thought that it must have come from Pranlal. It has so happened that a copy of the book has come to my hands for some months past. Shivaji (brother of Vinoba) of the Ashram has made a deep study (of the subject). I had written to him to send me any book he liked. And so this book came to me. So I have with me two copies at present. It has good maps, but the contents are not of much value. At present I have got with me better books (from the point of view of contents) than this. There can be no observation of the sky in this season. In September or October when the sky clears and the sunset will take place earlier, if you are allowed to remain outside till 7.30 or 8 you can observe the sky.libtech_486_footnote
 I see that your views about social reform are very advanced. My attitude in such matters is different. I would not discuss any matter which does not seem to be of immediate importance and about which there is the slightest room for doubt. Divorce is such a matter. For one thing,  among  the  masses   divorce  is  not   prohibited,   and   where   it is prohibited many other reforms need to  be  introduced  before we can go as far as divorce. I would not therefore spend my energy in discussing the subject and create confusion  in  the  minds of  people.
 As regards [artificial] birth-control, my mind revolts against it. It is possible that old ideas unconsciously influence my views, but  reasons for which I oppose it [really] exist today and we can,  therefore, see for ourselves the great harm done by [artificial] birth- control. By adopting artificial means to prevent  conception,  even those who are strong today are likely to become weak. The whole attitude to life behind the practice of birth-control is dangerous and mistaken. Its supporters believe that it is not only man’s right but also his duty to satisfy his natural sex desire, and that if a man does not discharge this duty his development will be retarded. I see great evil in
 
 this view. I observe it daily in experience. It is impossible to expect self-control in those who have recourse to these artificial means. These means are being advocated on the assumption that self-control in this matter is impossible. And to regard the control of the sex urge as impossible or unnecessary or harmful is to my mind a denial of dharma, for self-control is the very basis of dharma. There are many other simple and innocent methods of preventing the birth of weak progeny. Leaving them aside, how can a dangerous method like birth- control be adopted? Almost everybody admits that it is  full  of  dangers. Thus, from whatever point of view I think about it, it seems to me highly undesirable. I am prompted to write all this again because you have still time to think and, since the subject is very serious, it is necessary that you should examine it carefully. I shall have no fear then what conclusion you come to, for I believe that your truthfulness will save you in the end or that, if I am wrong, you will be able to correct my error. If you are convinced that birth-control is morally right, you will not rest until you have converted me to your view. And I am easy to deal with. However strongly I may cling to a view, I don’t hesitate to give it up immediately if I discover my error or if it is pointed out to me by somebody.
 All three of us are well. I now take milk, but I do not see any benefit. I have yielded to the pressure of the doctor here. The pain in the elbow persists, but it pains only when it is moved in a certain way, and hence there is no cause for anxiety about it. I have already written to Taramati in regard to visits.libtech_487_footnoteBesides making envelopes, Sardar has taken up two other things, viz., spinning and study of Sanskrit. He is pursuing the study with great energy. You have probably seen the 24 books by Satavlekar. Out of these he has finished three in 15 days. This is excellent speed.
 Devdas had another relapse, but from the latest information I have received it appears that fever has again come down. He says in his letter that the Gorakhpur Jail authorities looked after him very well. The position about my correspondence has become uncertain now. Incoming post is delivered fairly  regularly,  but  the  letters  which I write are delayed a good deal before they are despatched. You need not, therefore, worry if you don’t get my replies to your letters soon.
 
 Give me detailed information about the food which you get there, whether you can digest it, what exercise you can take, what your weight is and how you sleep. What are you reading at present?
 I am progressing well with my Urdu reading. I can now write a little. I am happy about this.

  LETTER TO SHIRINBAIlibtech_493_footnote 
 July 26, 1932
 
 MY DEAR SISTER,
 
 I received your disconsolate letter only today. It had to pass through so many hands before coming to me. My whole heart goes out to you and your aged mother. God suffers us to blame Him, to swear at Him and deny Him. We do it all in our ignorance. A very beautiful Sanskrit verse which we recite daily at the morning prayer means: “Miseries  are  not  miseries,  nor  is  happiness  truly happiness. True misery consists in forgetting God, true happiness consists  in  thinking  of Him  as  ever  enthroned  in  our  hearts.” And has not an English poet said: “Things are not what they seem?” The fact is if we knew all the laws of God we should be able to account for the unaccountable. Why should we think that the withdrawal of your brother from our midst is  an  affliction?  We  simply do not know. But we do, or ought to know that God is wholly good and wholly just. Even our illnesses such as your  other brother’s  may  be  no  misfortune.  Life  is  a   state   of   discipline. We are required to go through the fire of suffering. I do so wish that you and your mother could really rejoice in your suffering. May you have peace.
 Please forget all about the honeylibtech_494_footnoteand write to me in English by all means.

 I can understand your grief and hers over the loss of your childlibtech_495_footnoteof whom Lalitalibtech_496_footnoteused to write to me in such loving terms. But you have lived long enough in the Ashram to realize, especially on such occasions, that God has the right to take away from us what He gives us. You know that we believe. Our belief is that every one of us comes to this world as a debtor and we leave when the debt is for the time being discharged. The child has paid the debt and is free.

 BHAISHRI NAJUKLAL,
 You have written to me after keeping me waiting for a long time. I received your letter after eighteen days, but that is not your fault. Do you go to bed with an empty stomach? It is a universal experience that a person who eats late at night does not get sleep immediately on retiring. If, therefore, you do not take your meals before sunset, form that habit. And if you cannot concentrate on Ramanama, go on repeating any Sanskrit stanza or bhajan which you like, and you will most probably get sleep. I assume that in other respects, your health is good. Prabodhlibtech_497_footnotemust have become quite big now. All three of us are well.

Though I have written to her a 	letterlibtech_498_footnoteof 	condolence I now do not like to express condolence for the death (of 	someone). Why run away from death? God has given us many boons and 	death seems to be one of the greatest of them. It is not a calamity. 	We should learn to regard it as a friend. That which is for every 	living being, how can we regard as a calamity? By so looking upon 	it, we become offenders before God.Like Raihana if you write letters 	to me both in Gujarati and Urdu you also will be an expert like her. 	You must write in Gujarati so that you may acquire the habit. I wish 	that your knowledge of Gujarati may increase.     
 It is good that you have developed so much friendship with Rohini’s family. There is no doubt that the family is good and honest. But the certificate that you will give will be a true one. I am not much in touch with it. My salaams to all there.

 July 26, 1932
  	I do not remember having seen you any time. It is possible that  I 	might have seen you many years ago when I was out to  beg. Although 	I have no direct acquaintance with you, yet, as I have connections 	with your father and . . ., allow me to exercise some authority as 	an elder. But do not consider this my letter as coming from an 	elder. I wish to be your friend. I have known about the misdeed 	committed by I am pained on account of the misdeed  	because . . . has been brought up in the Ashram. Hence I have to 	apologize to you for his misdeed. You can accept my apology only 	when you entirely forget . . . from your mind, and you may not 	henceforth be caught in the snare of any youth.  	I believe that boys and girls, when they attain the age of 	discretion, are freed from the control of their parents. Parents may 	guide them as friends. (But) they cannot put pressure upon them. You 	have not attained the age to enjoy this freedom. You may not be 	knowing that I have guided many girls like you, and that from among 	them those who have followed my advice have become happy. In this 	world there is no vice (lit. dross) like untruth. He who conceals 	that which is not to be concealed acts untruthfully. If you believed 	that parents should not exercise their authority over you, but that 	they should guide you, then why should you write a secret note to or  	anybody? If you fall in love with anybody, you have a right to do 	so. But many boys and girls nourish their secret passions only in 	the name of affection. If they take a vow not to conceal anything 	from their parents and act accordingly, they cannot but be saved 	from such calamities.  	Your present time is for study only. You have been fortunate to have 	 parents  of   broad   views,   and   hence   they   are   affording 	you facilities for study. So long as you desire to avail yourself of 	this facility, you must lead the life of a celibate. But it is 	possible that this may be beyond your power. If it is so,  you  must 	 consult  your  parents with a pure mind. There is not the slightest 	need to feel hesitation in it. If you do this much and if you give 	me a promise (not to do such a thing again), then only I will know 	that there has    
 not remained in the least upon you the effect of the misdeed committed by	Give an answer to this letter if you get it. May God
protect you.

  A LETTER 
 [July 26, 1932]libtech_504_footnote
 I have received today your letter dated the  8th instant.  At present my post has become irregular. For some days I get my incoming post regularly. The outgoing post is still irregular. I do not know when you will receive this.

The steps you had taken about . . . were certainly appropriate. I think that he ought to have been brought to his senses in still more plain terms. There is nothing to be thought about him at present.
 You must have deeply thought about . . . . I see from the account given by you that her mind is still not purified. I have taken courage to write a letter to         Give it to her if you think it proper to
 do so. From this letter you will also come to know my views about children. I am grieved at this calamity which has fallen upon you, husband and wife, on account of          The responsibility for the faults
 (still) lurking in . . . rests as much on       as on the Ashram. As (the
 atmosphere) of purity cannot be made to pervade the Ashram, the children as well as the grown-up (inmates) do not become free from faults. It is my firm belief that where perfect sanctity prevails, an unholy person must leave off his impurities so long as he stays in this atmosphere. So much also has not been imparted in the Ashram. It is only because of this that instances like that of are to be found.

 has suffered much on       account. When he hears this, he will feel
 
 intense pain.
 I have returned the telescope in the beginning of this month. I was not permitted to keep it for more that a month’s time. Hence, your suggestion was late. We could make very little use of it. We could see Jupiter very well. But we could not get any information regarding the stars with the help of the telescope. We could not see the beauty of Parijata about which we had read. I will carry out your suggestions, when any other telescope comes to hand. At present the clouds do not allow us to have a sight of the sky.
 I have got the Sanskrit dictionary. I am reading Kharas’s book at present. I like his style. I feel that if anybody makes a beginning with this book, he would find it difficult. It is, as it were, written not for those who have absolutely no knowledge of astronomy. But I have gone through other books and hence I feel no difficulty in understanding this (book). I hope to hear from your mouth about your invention some time. In the mean time, please do write to me if there is anything worth writing.

But 	there is, I am afraid, no remedy for it. In a previous letter I 	asked you, if you could, to see Devdas.libtech_506_footnoteIt is not to be thought of now. You need a long rest 	from work both mental and physical. Remember me to Babu Sivaprasad 	and his people. Love,  BAPU  SMT. 	MIRABAI  SEVA 	UPVAN, 	NAGWA 	BENARES  From 	the original: C.W. 6230.

  LETTER TO RUKMINIDEVI BAZAJ 
 July 27, 1932
  	I got a letter from you after many days. I did not know that you 	were having fever. Naturally in that condition you cannot write. And 	if you cannot write, why should Benarsilibtech_508_footnotelibtech_509_footnotewrite? It seems that you have lost the strength you 	had gained at Deolali. You should regain it. I hope the child is 	thriving. It was a good thing that all of you went to see Devdas.

         DEAR 	. . . ,   A LETTERlibtech_510_footnote      July 	27, 1932 
  	You have become emaciated. But I can understand your misery. I have 	already told you that in your company your life and that of . . .libtech_511_footnotelibtech_512_footnotehave 	been spoiled.libtech_513_footnotelibtech_514_footnotelibtech_515_footnoteIf 	you really feel no passion, you cannot satisfy . . . although you 	submit to him. This is the experience of all men who seek pleasure. 	The result is that in spite  of having intercourse with you . . . 	remains unsatisfied, and that increases his passion. If, therefore, 	you two want to live together, you must take pleasure in intercourse 	with him. If you cannot do so, you should live separately. I see 	nothing but harm in your living together in your present condition. 	You deceive each other, you deceive yourselves and also deceive the 	world. All people except me seem to believe about you that, because 	you live in the Ashram, you live as ascetics. The best        
 course is that both of you should come out of this untruthful life and that both of you should marry according to your wish. According to me, both of you live an immoral life just now. If . . . marries another woman, I would regard his life afterwards to be blameless because it will be natural and in the end his passion will calm down. To make this change in your life, you should have a frank talk with each other and then firmly take whatever step seems proper to you both. If this is done, . . . will one day become free from passion. If you go on as at present, he will continue to feel dissatisfied and his passion  will become stronger and stronger. Do not lose the strength which you possess. Do not yield to despair. May God help you.

         DEAR 	. . . ,   A LETTER     July 	27, 1932 
  	Received your letter. I have carefully read your note. Your duty 	towards . . . appears clear to me. If she is devoid of passion you 	should live separately from her. If . . . does not desire it I would 	not regard her as being devoid of passion, that is, she ought to 	satisfy your passion. As you cannot suppress your passion you ought 	to form another marriage. Marry a suitable women if you can get one 	there. It would be better if she is a widow; and then satisfy your 	passion.libtech_516_footnotelibtech_517_footnoteYou will then become free in the course of time from 	your sexual craving. Today this seems to be almost impossible for 	you. The cause of your anger also is your sexual craving. Your 	palate is very strong, which is not surprising; for anger, sexual 	passion and craving of the palate go together. You believe that you 	are completely devoted to your work. But I doubt if that is so. I do 	not mean to say that you are indifferent. But anybody who is wholly 	devoted to his work can never be a slave of his passion. How can he 	find the time for that? But  you  are  certainly not so. It can be 	seen that you try to become devoted to your    
 work, but then you also try to overcome your sexual passion. As you have not succeeded in the second aim, so you have not succeeded in the first either. You seem to be a prey to lustful thoughts even when you are working. Was not that my condition too? Other people saw no sign of negligence in my work, but I myself could see such signs. That is why I resolved to observe  brahmacharya.libtech_518_footnoteRead my previous letter and this to I wish that anyhow you both should be relieved
 of this misery. May God be kind to you.

          CHI. 	PREMA,   LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK   July 	30, 1932 
  	I got your letter. There seems to be no limit to your foolishness. 	When you get angry, you lose all sense. In the very letter in which 	you write about having taken a vow to overcome anger, you get angry 	and that too without reason. You did not understand the reason for 	my gentle rebuke. I had complained that there was no beauty or art 	in the slips with zigzag edges which you  had  pasted  on  the  	envelope.libtech_525_footnoteI 	would not find fault with anyone for spending time on art. But in 	this case there was no art at all. What art can there be in pasting 	slips on an     
 envelope? And, moreover, you had pasted them so carelessly that they had half come off. Your anger, therefore, was without reason. It only amused me. If I were with you, I would have slapped you. But your having erred is a more serious matter. You spent so much time on the thing. You entered into unnecessary argument about it and harmed your health, for scientists have discovered by experiments that anger has a very bad effect on health. Our people have always held that belief. Besides, you violated your vow. Don’t get angry like  this  again. My criticism, moreover, was gentle and you did not show even sense enough to understand it.
 About letters, follow the example of the child who eats up the carrot when he finds that he cannot blow with it as with a pipe. That is, you should not feel unhappy if the letters stop. In any case, you should go on writing from your end. If I decide to stop writing, I will let you know. Even if I cannot write to you to tell you about that, your writing to me will not be a waste of effort.
 Greet the new flowers on my behalf. Try to cheer them by telling them that I hope to sleep in their midst one day.
 You are very difficult to persuade. If you grow tomatoes and some bhajis round the flower plants, you will get them all the year round and your health will benefit. If the body is not yours, but is a trust given to you by God, you should certainly give some time for keeping it fit. Growing tomatoes and bhajis does not require much time. They don’t cover up much plot either. An English friend of mine who lived with me in South Africa used to grow, in a few days and with little trouble, a bhaji named cress which is eaten uncooked.
 I have already written to you in regard to the bad health of the girls. Inquire into the matter carefully and find out the facts. I was certainly afraid that it was so about Rambhau. Since he has told you everything, try and win him over.
 If your weight has gone down, you must eat fruit. Don’t mind a little additional expense. What is the good of trying to save money and injuring your health? What is true about food is also true about rest. You must make it a rule to take some rest in the afternoon. It is not for me to show how you can spare time for that. If you are deter- mined to find it, you will succeed.
Now about your questions :
  Instead 	of worshipping 	an individual, 	one should 	worship virtues. An 	individual may 	turn out 	to be unworthy 	of our 	worship, and in any case he is bound to die. Virtues, on the other hand, never 
 perish.
  If 	you do 	not like 	most of those 	who run the Ashram, 	this is 	a golden 	opportunity to 	learn to 	tolerate their defects. 	No human 	being is 	without defects. If 	we wish to 	regard others as 	our own selves, we 	should have no 	likes and dislikes.  If 	you accept 	the principles 	on which 	the Ashram is 	founded, differences 	of opinion 	regarding its 	outward form 	should not 	matter. We 	should be 	concerned with 	the principle of 	a thing 	and not 	with its form.  It 	is your duty to 	remain in 	the Ashram 	so that 	you may overcome the 	defects of 	your temper.  If 	you cannot 	realize your ideals 	in the 	Ashram, the 	fault is 	yours. Everyone enjoys 	perfect freedom in the Ashram.  Why 	should the 	attraction of 	those whom 	you love force you 	to leave 	the Ashram? 	Their love should 	draw them to 	the Ashram 	whenever they feel the 	need to 	see you. Love never 	requires the physi- 	cal presence 	of the 	person loved. Love 	which requires such 	presence must be 	momentary attraction. 	The purity 	of one’s 	love is tested 	by separation 	from the 	loved one 	after his 	or her 	death. But 	all this is 	mere intellectual 	exercise. You will live only where your heart is. What can I do or you either, if your heart cannot accept the Ashram? 
 The yarn spun by me ought to be converted into saris. It belongs to a time before I expressed my views about yarnlibtech_526_footnotelibtech_527_footnote. It was in fact earmarked for Ba. Hence it is for her to renounce her claim over it. I cannot say that it is not for her. She will never be able to wear very coarse saris. Even the saris, therefore, supplied to her by the Ashram will usually be fine. For that reason, too, she may wear saris made from the yarn spun by me. But we should be very strict about the yarn spun in future, though even with regard to that I will not exercise compulsion on Ba. I certainly wish that she should, of her own free will, refuse to use it and be content with whatever she gets as her share. But this is about the future. As yet all the yarn spun by me recently is here. In any case, my yarn should not lie unused. In fact no one’s yarn should lie unused. As soon as a person has  spun enough quantity of yarn to be used for weaving, it should be pro- cessed for the purpose.
 
 31-5/3-6-1932. The addressee had argued that the yarn spun by Gandhiji should be kept for Kasturba’s use.
 You know about Dhurandhar. If none else, Lilavati, I believe, spins. What you say, however, is correct. Most women will prefer embroidery to spinning. What is true about eating is also true about work. The mind will run after bhajiyanlibtech_528_footnotein preference to rotli. There is self-control and renunciation in continuing to eat rotli, whereas it is self-indulgence to start eating bhajiyan. Similarly, there is self-control in keeping to spinning and self-indulgence (relatively) in taking up other work.
 Your comments on my advice “Judge not lest ye be judged”libtech_529_footnoteare unworthy of you. You have not understood the meaning of the statement at all. There is much pride behind your comments.‘Lest ye be judged” means that we should not do anything for which we should be judged by others. We should not be insolent towards the world. Why should we say, “Let the world say or do what it will”? We should be humble before the world, that is, even when we follow the right path we should not use violence against it or sit in judgment over it. On the contrary, we should endure its punishment and its condemnation. This is humility or non-violence. I should not like you to write what you did, though you probably wrote it sarcastically or in anger. I don’t mind your being angry with me. I can laugh it away. But this other remark rankles in my mind. You should never be prompted to pen such a remark, that is, you should not even have such a thought. Since you had it, I don’t mind your expressing it to me. It is because you expressed it that I am able to explain to you how it is wrong. I have not written this paragraph so that you may keep back your thoughts from me. I wish to see you as you are, whether foolish or insolent or humble. But what I ask of you is that you should not even let such a thought enter your mind.
 If the girls cannot massage with sufficient pressure, you should teach them how to do so. That requires not physical strength but skill. Now about what you have been reading. The belief which you refer to was held once. It is no longer held now. People have not understood some of Malthus’s theories, and some others are faulty.
The law which applies to lower animals does not apply to man. Lower
 
 animals live on one another. Man strives to grow out of that condition. It is the spirit of non-violence which prompts him to do so. So long as one’s body endures, one cannot realize perfect non-violence. If, however, a person cherishes the ideal of non-violence, he will live so as to commit the minimum violence. Man’s excellence lies in his  readiness to let others live and lay down his own life. As he progresses, his food also changes for the better. He has capacity to grow still further. There have been many more discoveries after Darwin’s. The book which you have been reading seems to be an old one. Whether it is old or new, the principle of “the greatest good of the greatest num- ber” or “survival of the fittest” is false.
 Non-violence aims at the good of all. The divine law cannot be any other but the good of all. It is our duty to discover how to bring that about and what man’s duty is under such a law, and not to oppose that law by another. But this is a vast subject. I have dealt with a few points in brief. If you want me to discuss the subject further, put me some questions.

   LETTER TO G. D. BIRLA     BHAI 	GHANSHYAMDAS,    July 	30, 1932 
  	I have your letter of the 22nd instant. I have gone through all the 	books on economics available with me. But that does not mean that I 	have quite understood them. Still my understanding has been enriched 	to some extent. I had expected to receive some more books from you 	before I had finished reading the last of these. But you did not 	receive that letterlibtech_530_footnoteof 	mine. Now this one is yet another letter gone astray. I want the 	reports of the Fowler Committee, Chamberlain Committee, Babington 	Smith and Hilton Young Committee along with the dissenting reports, 	Dadachanji’s book on currency or exchange and the one recently 	written by Findlay Shirras.  	I am a bit afraid that almonds will not suit you. I can digest 	almonds, ground-nuts and such oily nuts as I have subsisted on them    
 for years. For you milk and curds are the main food, very little of starch and of the dal proteins none. I have found by experience that wheat, milk, curds, salads and non-starchy fruits like grape, pomegra- nate, orange, apple, pineapple and papaya, these form the necessary and suitable diet for people like you. Almonds can supplant milk only when a vegetable is found equivalent to milk. Chemical tests prove that almonds and milk have common properties excepting a certain specific property which is found in milk but not in almonds and which is present in animal proteins only. I have full faith that among millions of vegetables there must be one possessing that specific property but our vaidyas have done no research in this matter owing to sheer lethargy. Hence almonds are not as useful to us as milk.
 The condition of my arm is the same as before but it does not interfere with my work. Therefore there is absolutely no cause for anxiety.
 All three of us are well. You will be glad to know that Sardar has started learning Sanskrit and he is making very rapid progress.

  LEARN THE “GITA” BY HEARTlibtech_531_footnote 
 July 31, 1932
 I have often written and spoken advising people to learn the Gita by heart. Since I myself have not been able to do that, it does not become me to advise people that they should. But I do not feel ashamed of doing so time and again, because I know the benefits of the practice. I am able to face my problems somehow, because I knew once as many as thirteen chapters by heart and have been meditating on the teachings of the Gita for the past many years. It may be said, therefore, that I have lived my life under its protecting shade. However, if I had been able to learn the whole Gita by heart and had studied it with greater care, I would probably  have  gained  much more than I have. But what happened or may happen to me does not matter. My life, it may be said, is over, though I would, if I got an opportunity, try once again to learn it by heart.
 
 the following item.
 Here the word Gita should be understood in a wider sense. It means the book or work which is our spiritual authority. Since for most of us it is the Gita, I have used that name. But Amtul, Amina and Qureshi should learn by heart the whole or a part of the Koran-e- Sharif instead of the Gita. Those who do not know any Sanskrit and cannot learn it now may memorize a Gujarati or a Hindi translation. Anybody whose faith is not in the Gita but in some other holy book may memorize that.
 We should also know what is meant by “memorizing”. We should sincerely attempt to live according to the teaching of the book which we learn by heart. That teaching should not be in conflict with certain fundamental principles and we should have understood its meaning fully.
 This practice has its reward. If at any time we do not have the book with us or our copy is stolen or burnt, if we are stranded in a strange place or lose our eye-sight or power of speech while our mind is clear—we can imagine other similar circumstances—if in such circumstances we know our beloved book by heart, it can give us great peace of mind, show us the right path and act as our friend in our misfortune.
 This is also the experience of the whole world. Our fore fathers— whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Parsi—used to memo- rize certain portions of holy books. Many do that even today. We should not disregard the precious experience of all these people. In some measure this is a test of our faith.

  LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI 
 July 28/31, 1932
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got today your letter of 25th/26th. We ought to thank God that you still get my letters. But we should thank Him even when you do not receive them. This will mean that we shall have learnt to be equal towards cold and heat, good and bad, happiness and suffering. If we have truly handed over to Him the direction of our lives, we should dance as He wills. We may be happy if He sends us a letter, and should be happy, too, when He sends none. Narasinh Mehta danced and sang with relief : “It is a blessing that the net is cut.” That certainly did not
 mean that his wife was not dear to him or that her presence did not make him happy. She was of course dear to him. However, when she died he felt that there was divine providence in that, even that it was God’s kindness. Hence, as long as you continue to get my letters let them give you what pleasure they can. But rest content when they stop. You will discover that there is joy even in that contentment.
 I got the postcard which you wrote on getting the previous packet of letters. The condition of the elbow has remained the same. The weight had risen to 105libtech_532_footnotelibtech_533_footnote/  pounds, but it has again gone down to
 104. Such minor changes are bound to be there from time to time, but otherwise my health is quite good.
 As a principle it is correct that Padma ought not to have incurred a debt. But circumstances may change and a principle may no longer remain applicable. To do her justice, therefore, we should take into account the total figure and, if you feel that the expense was justified, you should pay the debt. We can imagine circumstances in which one has no choice but to incur a debt. It may even be one’s duty to do that. All such principles have to be relaxed when circumstances change. Only then can we do justice in every case. If we do not act in this manner, we would be merely clinging to the letter of  a rule. About Titus, do what you think best.
 It is a great achievement on Keshu’s part to have spun yarn of up to 200 counts. How many rounds of such quality did he spin? If you send samples of every quality of such yarn—strings of five or seven threads each tied to your letter—we shall get them safe and be able to see the yarn. Also send, with somebody who may be coming to this side, a few slivers from among those with which he could spin such fine yarn. If he can spin more such yarn, you should also be ready to get cloth woven from it. On which type of spinning-wheel did he spin yarn of 200 counts, and what was the spindle like?
 I have already written to you that at present I spin on the Gan- diva wheel.libtech_534_footnotelibtech_535_footnoteAfter making some improvements in its spindle-bearer, I can easily spin on it yarn of 30 counts. Today I probably spun yarn of still higher count. The waste, moreover, is negligible. The improve- ments are these : There is just enough space in the spindle-bearer to fit the spindle; the spindle-bearer is made very narrow; the spindle fits so closely that there is no room for the pulley to move loosely, since
 
 
 there is just enough space for the spindle to rotate freely. These improvements have reduced to a minimum the accidents  which resulted in the snapping of the threads, and enable us to draw very fine threads without fear. I have to see whether, by making the spindle still thinner, I can spin fine yarn with greater ease.
 I get news about Mirabehn quite regularly here. The latest news I had, at the time of writing this letter, was of 23rd. She was bad- ridden then, though the postcard was written in her own hand. She has become very weak.
 I understand what you say about the changes in the prayers. The important thing is that nobody should look upon the prayers as an infliction. As a healthy man feels the pangs of hunger in his stomach if he has not eaten anything on some day, so also a person with a healthy soul cannot but feel uneasy if he has not prayed during a day.
Do what you think proper regarding Prabhudas.
I suppose Shankarbhai’s arm is no longer in plaster.
 I don’t like to tell Premabehn to make her letters shorter. I ought to let her pour out her heart. I know that she must be giving a good deal of her time to these letters, but probably she feels satisfied after writing them.
 I will write to Mathew. Read that letter. The inmates of the Ash- ram will be able to put into practice my suggestion regarding educationlibtech_536_footnotelibtech_537_footnoteonly to the extent that you have been able to understandthe idea and can carry it out. It is something which I cannot easily make clear by explaining in words. It is only by putting it into practice that one can show how easy study and learning can be if we master that key, and how the thing can be done without much ostentation.
 July 31, 1932
 About Narmada, I wrote to you in my letter dated 31libtech_538_footnote-7-1932. I don’t suppose you could have got it in due time. I need not write anything more in this. I had one more letter from Shambhushankar. I am sure that, if anything was possible, you must have done it. I bless her and pray that her honour may remain inviolate.

 Nobody, whether a woman or a man, needs a physical weapon to protect herself or himself. Sometimes such weapon is used against that person himself. Moreover, a woman who [believes in] ahimsa will protect herself by killing herself rather than the evil-doer. A woman should have faith, like Sita and Draupadi, that God will protect her honour. God dwells in us in the form of His qualities and protects us. [Do you understand] this? Mahadev had received your letter. Did you get his reply?

 You are suffering from a subtle pride and diffidence at the  same time. How can you feel lonely in the midst of so many human beings, every one of whom demands your service and in whose midst you have thrown in your lot? You are in the midst of books and you will not touch them. You are in the midst of Hindi-speaking men and women and you will not speak to them. You are in the midst of workers and you will not throw yourself into the work and make two blades of grass grow where only one was growing yesterday, make two yards of cloth where only one was woven yesterday. All our philosophy is dry as dust if it is not immediately translated into some act of loving service. Forget the little self in the midst of the greater you have put yourself in. You must shake yourself free from this lethargy.

  LETTER TO A GIRLlibtech_553_footnote 
 July 31, 1932
 What a reason for not going to the Ashram! what would happen if everyone followed your example? Have you not heard the story of the Kazi and his dog? The dog died, and its corpse was taken for burial in procession, which was joined by the whole town. But when the Kazi himself was dead, there were hardly enough mourners to carry his coffin to the cemetery. Are you not guilty in the same manner or as the Gujarati bhajan puts it, “Man’s friends are selfish; they will all desert him in the end.” When a man dies, we burn his corpse. But you—I leave the sentence for you to complete. My point is that we must not make an individual the object of our affection which should be reserved only for his virtues. And this attachment should spring from pure love. Every person’s virtues result in some concrete act or other. If we admire his virtues, we should promote the

When you write to me next, please let me know why you wrote the last letter with pencil. Anybody who writes a letter with pencil without a special reason commits a wrong.

  LETTER TO HERMANN KALLENBACH 
 YERAVDA  CENTRAL PRISON,
 August 3, 1932
 MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE,
 You seem to have forgotten me. But my companions and I often talk about you.
 Manilal tells me he thoughtlessly leased to someone a plot of the Phoenix land without reference to the trustees.libtech_555_footnoteIf there is no objection to the lease except on the ground of Manilal’s thoughtlessness, I feel that it would be well to protect him by validating the agreement. Manilal says the other trustees are agreeable. If during the five years the whole ground has to be sold, it can be subject to the lease. I amhoping however that years of labour put in the settlement will not have that sorry end. This brings to mind Tolstoy Farm. What is the state of things there? I am well.
Love,

         CHI. 	MANILAL,   LETTER TO MANILAL GANDHI   August 	3, 1932 
  	I got your letter. You have asked for a reply by cable but a 	prisoner cannot easily send cables like that. The authorities may 	perhaps forward it, but I must observe proper limit. Moreover nearly 	a month has passed since you wrote your letter and there would be no 	harm if another month passes. I, therefore, did not ask for 	permission to send a cable. It was not quite proper that a promise 	to hand over the lease was made directly, but now that it is made I 	have written to Kallenbach to endorse it if possible. The letterlibtech_556_footnotelibtech_557_footnoteis 	enclosed. I hope that you yourself will have been able to persuade 	him before you get this letter and it will not be necessary for you 	to use my letter.     
 Please send me a copy in the Phoenix Trust-deed. It is possible that there is a copy in the Ashram. But in case we do not find it there,  I should have a copy to consult it if necessary.
 I think you will now stay there. It will not be wrong at all if you have decided to do that. There, too, you will be doing service.
But do not be lazy in writing to me.

         CHI. 	PREMA,   LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK   August 	3, 1932 
  	I got your letter of the 1st. I hope you are not getting frightened 	at the crowing in the hostel. If the girls are well behaved, there 	will be no difficulty. There will be none, either if we have 	perfectly learnt the 
 lesson of non-attachment. Others can suggest  mostly  external remedies for tour health. About internal remedies, you alone  can judge. I do not have much faith in psychologists. How much can even the best trained psychologist know about the human mind? Hence, you yourself should try and know what connection your ill-health has with your mind and adopt the proper remedies. In this very letter, however you say that heavy or light work and proper sleep or its absence do have an effect on health. Thus the truth is that  both internal and external factors have a bearing on one’s health. No one has been able to maintain good health with the help of mind alone, neglecting external measures. You should, therefore, listen to Naran- das’s advice in regard to sleep, rest and work, and examine the mental cause yourself. Take any measures you think necessary but make your body as strong as steel. I should have told you at the very beginning that you should not take Kuhne-bath in warm water during the period of your monthly course.
 The inner voice is something which cannot be described in words. But sometimes we have a positive feeling that something in us prompts us to do a certain thing. The time when I learnt to recognize this voice was, I may say, the time when I started praying regularly. That is, it was about 1906. I searched my memory and tell you this because you asked the question. In fact, however, there was no moment when I suddenly felt that I had some new experience. I think my spiritual life has grown without my being conscious of the fact in the same way as hair grows on our body.
 This is how repetition of God’s name wipes out one’s sins. Anyone who sincerely follows that practice is bound to have faith. He starts with the conviction that such repetition will wipe out his sins. Wiping out of sins means self-purification. One who repeats God’s name daily with faith will never grow tired of doing so, and, therefore, the name which he repeats with his lips to start with sinks ultimately into his heart, and that purifies him. This is a universal experience. Psychologists also believe that man becomes what he thinks. Ramanama follows this law. I have unshakable faith in the virtue of repeating God’s name. I am convinced that the person  who  discovered it had first-hand experience [of spiritual life] and that his discovery is of the utmost value. The door of purification should open even for the illiterate. Repetition of God’s name opens it for them. (See Gita IX. 22, X.10.) Telling beads and similar practices help one
 to concentrate and to count the number of times the name has been repeated.
 Studies should be undertaken only with the aim of equipping oneself for service. Since, however, service of others gives one the highest joy, one may say that studies are for joy. I have not heard of anyone, however, who found unbroken joy in life through literary pursuits alone without devoting himself to service.
 Art cannot be the monopoly of any country or individual. That which requires secrecy is no art.
 It is the right and the duty of every country to protect its industries. It is the duty of a person who follows the path of non- vio-lence to give shelter to the homeless. Who should be treated ashomeless can be decided only by reference to the circumstances of each case.
 What seems bad in its outward appearance is not always so in its substance. The unattractive appearance of Urdu books indicates their publishers’ lack of means. But cannot their contents be excellent? In fact the contents of some of them are so. In making the list, however, how does the question of the work being or not being interesting arise? Since the list has to be made, the work must be interesting because there is interest in doing one’s duty. If you take the trouble some time of learning a little Urdu, you will find the study interesting in itself.

 Dr. Mehta is no more. I have lost a lifelong faithful friend. But for me he lives more intensely by his death than before, for I treasure his many virtues now more than ever. That treasure becomes a sacred trust. Here is a letter for Maganlal. I expect you to do all you can to make him a worthy son of his father. I have advised him not to worry but continue his studies. Broken down though Dr. Mehta had become of late, I expect he had preserved his original circumspection to make suitable financial arrangem-ents for Maganlal’s studies. Maganlal will know.

  LETTER TO ESTHER MENON libtech_560_footnote 
 August 4, 1932
 Brotherhood is just now only a distant aspiration. To me it is a test of true spirituality. All our prayers, fasting and observances are empty nothings so long as we do not feel a live kinship with all life. But we have not even arrived at that intellectual belief, let alone a heart realization. We are still selective. A selective brotherhood is a selfish partnership. Brotherhood requires no consideration or response. If it did, we could not love those whom we consider as vile men and women. In the midst of strife and jealousy, it is a most difficult per- formance. And yet true religion demands nothing less from us. Therefore each one of us has to endeavour to realize this truth for ourselves irrespective of what others do.

  LETTER TO RATILAL SHETH 
     BHAI 	RATILALlibtech_574_footnote 	,  August 	4, 1932 
  	Perhaps I will feel the loss of Doctor the most, because I am not 	able to do anything to help in preserving the prosperity of his  	business. Doctor was always apprehensive about how Chhaganlal would 	behave after his death. You can probably, if you do your best, prove 	his fear unjustified. I could see when I was in Rangoon that 	Lilavatilibtech_575_footnotelibtech_576_footnotehad great influence over Chhaganlal. I was happy that 	it was so. I could not judge whether Lilavati was making good use of 	that       
 influence or abusing it. I did have some misgivings. I had even cautioned her and she had reassured me. But in Doctor’s  letters whichI received here he had expressed great disappointment about her. In Rangoon he had even wept before me. I do not know what influence  you  still  have  [over]libtech_577_footnotelibtech_578_footnoteLilavati.  Nor  do  I  know  how   far Doctor’s fear was justified. I hope that you will not fail to contribute your share to see that Doctor’s nest is not ruined, that all the brothers preserve good relations and do not quarrel among themselves and that the business does not suffer.
Please write to me frankly.

  LETTER TO PRABHUDAS GANDHI 
 
        CHI. 	PRABHUDAS,  Y. M.,  August 	4, 1932 
  	I got your letter. I had been waiting for it. You must not feel 	distressed that you could not meet anyone. It is a mercy that even 	letters are permitted, for how can a prisoner expect to be permitted 	to receive letters? Preserve the health with which you have come 	out. Pranayama does benefit, particularly persons with a lung 	disease. It must be remembered that pranayama is not to be 	done in a hurry. How was the behaviour of the jail officials? Was it 	courteous?  	I have already conveyed to you that I have given up the Magan 	charkha for the present. I could not go beyond 20 counts. I am not 	able to use both my hands. I cannot draw the yarn with my left hand. 	I can therefore try only the right hand. I have got adjusted to it. 	But since I have been permitted to turn the Gandiv wheel with the 	left hand, I felt that I ought to change over to it. I have acquired 	wonder- ful control over it. Even on this I draw the yarn with the 	righthand and have gone up to 35 counts. I am also picking up speed, 	though it is still quite slow. It is around one hundred rounds, but 	I am satisfied. There is very little wastage and even in such as 	takes place, I am    
 making small improvements. I have thus had to postpone the Magan charkha experiment for the present. I will of course not give it up completely. I enjoy spinning on that too. Cling to the Divine Name like one possessed. When you have no help from anywhere else, you will get it from the Name.
 May your ambition of improving the Magan charkha be ful- filled.
 Do go to Almora. All of us agree with your idea of not giving a big name to the Ashram at present. You may therefore call it shail Ashram. Of the five names all the three of us liked that the best. We did not waste our time in thinking of another name. Ultimately we are concerned with the work, not with the name.
 The Ashram is certainly not to be filled only with invalids. Some of course are bound to come. If Padmalibtech_579_footnotecomes, she must bereceived. You should get separate expenses for any such persons who may come. There would of course be a budget for the Ashram. I will not decide the figure for it. You may settle it with Narandas. It is proper that the expenditure on you, too, should be counted separately. This would be convenient for you. What you write about your work there is also correct. You should not take up too many things just now. You should proceed slowly and only as much as your health permits. For the present you should do only what you can on your  own responsibility. I would be happy if you could tempt Balkrishna. He would be very good company for you. He may also improve in health and the Ashram would gain in dignity. If Dhirulibtech_580_footnotedesires to join, it should be with a firm resolve to be steady there. Let him join if he does so on that condition. It would of course be excellent if you could find some good hill people to join you.
 You have mentioned having enclosed Krishna’s letter  but I don’t see it. Either you forgot, or the letter was left behind at Sabar- mati. Where is. . .libtech_581_footnotelibtech_582_footnote?

  	I am intensely dissatisfied with myself for having allowed our 	conversation of yesterday to drift into a discussion primarily of my 	wretched   arm.libtech_587_footnoteI 	  wanted   to   know   the   daily   routine   of   all   the 	companions. For this there were hardly a few minutes left. But the 	information I gained emboldens me to offer a suggestion. Whilst I 	appreciate a study of French and other continental languages I feel 	that we ought first to devote our attention to our own languages. 	Mahadev tells me that you had already begun a serious study of 	Sanskrit and that you know a little Gujarati. May I then suggest 	your devoting your time first to studying Sanskrit, Gujarati and 	Hindi? I do believe that each one of us should make the very best 	use of the precious time at our disposal. Since you know Urdu and 	Persian so well, Hindi is child’s play. You should be able to read 	the Ramayana of Tulsidas in the original.  	You will excuse this presumption, please. Love from us all.  Yours,  M. K. GANDHI  From 	the original: S. A. Brelvi Papers. Courtesy: Nehru Memorial Museum 	and Library     LETTER TO MATHURADAS P. ASAR   [Before August 7, 1932]libtech_588_footnote  CHI. 	MATHURADAS,  	I have your letter. The hook for the cup has not yet arrived. I am 	not even ready to use it as yet. Every day the cup is before my 	eyes. It has not been our intention to go on increasing the count. I 	am going to be steady at around 40 counts myself. Most probably it 	will      
 be the same in the case of Sardar. Mahadev may settle at around 80 counts. Then testing it would be the thing to do. It would be easy to see the result. If the yarn is even and does not break while being taken off and is tightly wound round the spindle, then the yarn is not likely to be weak. On the other hand, there are chances of being cheated in the tests made using the cup or the machine used in a mill. The yarn cannot be unwound from just any place. There would be much waste in doing so. Hence, only if the yarn is even from the point of unwinding can it stand the test. This means that yarn can be tested only by the weaver. The yarn which can be used for weaving without difficulty is good yarn. But the purpose of writing is not to disregard the tools of yarn-testing. My purpose is only to indicate the time for doing the test. At one time I used to do the testing every day. I had prepared the tool for the purpose with the materials available at home. But then I found that it was taking a lot of time. And I was not able to effect much improvement thereby. I also saw that where I only used my guess instead of the test, my guess frequently turned out to be correct, because, while unwinding the yarn, it would have  passed  before the eyes. One would also know how often it has broken and also how well the yarn has been wound on the spindle. And so, an intelligent spinner automatically gets an idea about the quality of his yarn. Otherwise you are absolutely correct in arguing that there is no reason to gloat over the fact if the yarn is of 100 counts on weighing.  I know that there can be yarn of 100 counts fit only to be thrown away. I have also seen such yarn. Any attempt to spin such yarn is sheer waste of time. Hence, anyone spinning fine yarn should be convinced that the yarn will easily be turned into a length of cloth. Then alone can the yarn be considered as of good quality, otherwise it is useless; That is why I had written to Narandas two or three months ago that he should make arrangements for the weaving of fine yarn.
 Your report about the Yajnik Sewing Machine is interesting. If we get volunteers in thousands involved in the . .  .  .libtech_589_footnoteright  at  the beginning, the experiment will not go very far. Hence, we must invent something which will ensure proper use of the hand needle and does not take much time. It is only with this in view that I have kept embroidery and knitting in my mind. The art of Yajnik sewing is not for making available to the poor ready-made khadi garments, but for quick disposal of the khadi woven by the poor without loss. It is for
 
 making expensive-looking khadi inexpensive. But if we expect from a fairly wealthy person that he shall buy khadi however expensive and however coarse it may be, and then get it stitched at his own expense, then khadi cannot go very far. Alternatively khadi should be sold at a loss or the spinning charges, etc., should be brought down. In your plan I saw the suggestion to avoid doing that and so I promptly welcomed it. Hence you should convince the ladies  who  have protested that they should feel gratified that they adorned the khadi woven by the poor by stitching it free and serving the poor. For, by their action, the stitched garments could be sold at the price of unwashed khadi and we could pay the poor their full wages. We can certainly make an inexpensive sewing-machine in this country; but I think it can only be an imitation of the machine in vogue at present. If so, it should mean overriding the patent law. The Singer and othermachines have invested capital of millions of rupees and wherever patent laws prevail, they must be registering their patents. But I am not fully conversant with the situation, and if somebody invents an original design and prepares a sewing-machine which is simpler than the machines currently in use, he himself can earn millions by registering his patent. Because, he would then compete with the Singer machine. Our craftmanship has still not inspired such confidence in me. In the West, there are countless new inventions every day. But that is not our field at all. Something like that has no doubt been in my mind. our ancestors invented the greatest thing in the shape of the spinning-wheel. Millions of people have benefited from it. Textile machinery is based on the design of the spinn- ing-wheel. Hence there is still much scope in the direction of improve- ment of the spinning-wheel. I am sure that something will emerge. There can be a profit of millions, but there is no chance for a single individual to earn millions.
 Now about your diet. You have done well to give up starches. Equally important is the point about pulses. If the curd is absolutely sweet (not sour), it can never cause headache. To make it safe, a little soda may be added to it. But if one can take milk, there is no need to take curd. It is only superstition that papaw is harmful to the eyes. Any person can test this fact by taking only papaw. He should take nothing else with it. This can be tested by having a single meal of papaw. There is no need to entertain such a superstition even with regard to ripe tomatoes. Your diet can consist of thin chapati, green vegetables and milk. You must have something sweet. You can take
 currants, black grape or raisins. Raw onion can do you good, but it can be taken only in the evening because I know that it gives off a terrible smell. I have myself eaten lots of raw onions. I did it only in the evening and avoided meeting anyone afterwards. But the tolerance of our women is infinite. But since Ba has been in the habit of making free comments over the years, she could not hold herself from remar- king on the matter. And in the end she always warned me against going before anyone else with my mouth stinking. And she was absolutely right. I am afraid your digestive system cannot accept almonds. Do not go on brooding about your diet. Do not brood over your illness either. Once you have decided about something, it should be taken as settled. Taking a vow only means that our mind stops bothering about it after the vow has been taken. Just as a trader doesnot bother about the thing he has already sold and starts thinking about the next thing, so also the mind.

          DEAR 	DR. ANSARI,   LETTER TO DR. M. A. ANSARI      August 	7, 1932 
  	What a joy to have had such a letter from you. It was thoughtful of 	you to have sent us the medical report. Hardly a day passed but we 	have talked of you. You have suffered. It is good you are going out 	for treatment. We all hope you will profit by it and return fully 	restored to health.  	It was equally considerate of you to have given a full report of 	Jawaharlal’s health. I 	expect to hear from you regularly.  	And now about ourselves. We have all been keeping quite well. I am 	taking milk. My weight is 105. We are leading a student’s life. 	Sardar gives full 4 hours or more to Sanskrit. He gives nearly two 	hours to spinning and turns waste paper into envelopes. I learnt 	only here that he had an eye for neatness and a deft hand. This will 	be closed in an envelope of his make. So you see he is adding to the 	wealth of the country. Mahadev is reading French, gives Sanskrit 
 lessons to the Sardar, does my writing work, reads other things and does 3 hours’ spinning and needful cooking, etc. I do  over  two  hours’ spinning and Urdu. I have read those Jamia publications that were sent to me. And now I am rereading Shibli’s Life of the Prophetlibtech_590_footnotelibtech_591_footnote. I carry on a little Urdu correspondence. One of my corres- pondents is a girl whom you are reported to know. Her name is Zohralibtech_592_footnotelibtech_593_footnote.  What  a   wonderful   hand   she   writes.  My   Urdu   teacher   is Raihana whom too you know. She is the daughter of our old young friend Abbas Tyabji. She is a brick.
 Bon voyage and love from us all. Good-bye.libtech_594_footnote

  DR. PRANJIVANDAS MEHTAlibtech_595_footnote 
 August 7, 1932
 If I were in the Ashram just now, I would have said a few words about this holy soul. He was my oldest friend. I came into contact with him when I first went to Englandlibtech_596_footnote, and our relations became closer as time passed. He was the first person whom I met in England and from the very beginning he acted as my guide and counsellor. But all this is there in the  Autobiography.libtech_597_footnoteHere I do not wish to write about our intimate relations. If we know what virtues he possessed because of which I describe him as a holy soul, we shall be able to emulate them, and can have faith that we also can achieve in our lives what he did in his.
 Doctor had won a gold medal at the Grant Medical College. After that, he passed more examinations in England and was enrolled as Barrister. But I leave all these achievements. All of us cannot shine as scholars. For that we require favourable circumstances. Men are not worshipped for their attainments in letters. It is for their virtues that they are worshipped. I saw Doctor continually progressing in such virtues as firmness of mind, courage, generosity, purity, love of truth, ahimsa and simplicity. Once he had made up his mind to  do  something, he would never change. His word, therefore, was trusted by people who had dealings with him. And he was always fearless. When he returned from England, he found that he could not keep up his self-respect in his native town of Morvi, and he, therefore, left it for good. Doctor’s liberality knew no bounds. His house was like a dharmasala. No deserving poor ever returned empty-handed from  him. He had helped and supported a number of people. There was no ostentation in his help. He never boasted about it. It knew no limits of caste or community or province. There were people in all provinces and belonging to all communities and faiths who had benefited from his generosity. Doctor had enough wealth and to spare, but he was not proud of it. He spent very little of it on pleausres for himself. It can be
 said that in his very large bungalow he occupied the smallest space for his use. I don’t remember his having ever spent money in self-indulg- ence. I believe that he had relations with no other woman except his
 
 wife. During the last many years of his life he loved brahmacharya. In his early life, Doctor had little interest in reading religious books, but in his later life his love for such books increased. In a letter which he wrote to me here he mentioned the books which he had been reading. All of them were religious books. So far as I know, Doctor had scrupulously followed truth both in his business and his legal practice. I know that he had great hatred of falsehood and hypocrisy. His ahimsa was visible on his face and could be read in his eyes, and it was becoming deeper day by day. Of course the atman in man never dies, but Doctor has become, through his virtues, immortal in a special sense. His close connection with the Ashram was a great help in its religious aspirations. Let us learn something, each one to the best of his or her ability, from the life of this holy soul.

  LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI 
 August 2/7, 1932
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got your mail today. If Narmada is saved, we shall think that we have rescued a cow from the slaughter-house. Help Liladharlibtech_598_footnotelibtech_599_footnotein every way you can. If you show him love, he may recover his balance of mind. Never let him feel that he lives outside the Ashram. And still he should be free and so also we. He must assume at least some responsibility for the girls. That is for his own good. Read my letterlibtech_600_footnoteto him. Do what you think proper about Jaisukhlal’slibtech_601_footnotelibtech_602_footnotedaughters. If the elder one does not stay there willingly, it would be difficult to watch her all the time. You must have read Indu’s letter. Read my replylibtech_603_footnotelibtech_604_footnoteto him. What is the doctor’s opinion about Mani? If Kusum’s lungs have become all right, take care and see that she does not weaken them again by over-exertion. She at least should find this weather good for her health. On two conditions, however—that she does not exert  herself too much and that she consumes enough milk and ghee. As far as possible, help everybody who has come from the Vidyapith. I,
 
 too, had heard about Devdas, and also about Dr. Mehta. There is every possibility that the latter’s illness may prove fatal this time. I don’t know what kind of a will he has made. You must have judged from his letters that Chhaganlal and Lilavati have caused him much grief. What are Ratubhai’s circumstances at present? You are likely to know whether his work leaves him any time. It would be excellent if he goes there as soon as he can and see that Chhaganlal and Lilavati play no mischief. I am sure Ratilal also would like to go. If he wishes to go, I think it will be useless to try to dissuade him. However, you will be a better judge of that. Where is Nanalal at present? I am not at all surprised by what I read about Harilal. I am afraid his whole life will pass thus. Read my letterlibtech_605_footnotelibtech_606_footnoteto Ramji. It is our duty to bear with him in as many things as we can. That will be our atonement for  our treatment of the Antyajas. We are not likely to get better men from among them than he or Dudabhai.
 August 4, 1932
 If you show to the Municipal Engineer, Mr. Malik, the spot on the prayer-ground which was threatened by the flood, he will help you. I think you know him. He used to visit the Ashram formerly. If you ask Bhai Mavalankar, he will request Shri Malik to come and see you. The danger from floods was known from the beginning. That is why the weaving shed and “Hridaykunj” were built as farther back as possible. Probably this work cannot be done during the rainy season, but it would be best to follow an engineer’s advice. Such things happen in Bengal every year. The rivers there are notorious for their power of causing erosions.
 August 7, 1932
 I got without delay your wire and letter about Doctor. I had been regularly getting cables from Rangoon. On the day on which I got your wire, I wrote to youlibtech_607_footnotelibtech_608_footnoteand to Ratilallibtech_609_footnotelibtech_610_footnoteand Champa. I hope you got the letters immediately. You must have got my wirelibtech_611_footnotelibtech_612_footnote, too. The fact that there has been no cable from Rangoon after the one giving the news of Doctor’s death makes me think. Whether or not any cable is received, I think it would be best for Ratilal and Champa not to go. They should trust to their fate. I gave similar advice about Maganlal
 
 too.
I have made a little change in my diet since eight days ago.
 Eating rotlis twice seemed to be causing slight constipation. Hence, for one meal I eat four bananas. In the evening, I don’t eat bananas, but eat some vegetables as I did previously. Just now the vegetable is generally guvarlibtech_613_footnoteor patkalulibtech_614_footnote. I mix the vegetable with milk and eat it. There is also a mosambi or an orange. I eat one in the morning too. This has relieved constipation to some extent. I am still watching. In the experiment which I am making now, most probably milk will remain one of the items. This time the weight came to 105 pounds. My health must be described as good in all respects.
There are 37 letters in all. Nine of them are bound with a string.

         CHI. 	MIRA,   LETTER TO MIRABEHN     August 	7, 1932 
  	I have two postcards and one letter to acknowledge. Vallabhbhai 	makes the choice of the best envelopes from his ever increasing 	stock. No wonder you appreciate his art. It is an art which turns 	waste into wealth. I am delighted that Rajendra Babu is with you. If 	I fail to write to him, give my love to him in which Vallabhbhai and 	Mahadev join. I doubt not that wherever possible, you are speaking 	in Hindi.  	You a sked me the other day about a further selection of bookslibtech_615_footnotewhen and if you get the leisure. Babu Sivaprasad has a 	very fine collection of books. He and Rajendra Babu can help you to 	make the selection. As you like the Ramayana, you are likely, 	too, to appreciate the Mahabharata. It is a big task but it 	is worth undertaking. And then there are the Vedas and the 	Upanishads. You can have selected readings from the former and read 	all the principal Upanishads. This course will certainly give you an 	insight into the Hindu thought that would be valuable. Your 	intuitive love of      
 Hinduism will then have the backing of an informed mind. And it may be that you might have to correct some of the notions you have formed. I would balance this reading by a reading of the Koran and Amir Ali’s Spirit of Islam. Pickthall’s translation of the Koran is perhaps the best. I cannot tell. But if not that, then Dr. Mohamed Ali’s translation. I have now given you fully a year’s course of good, solid reading.
 I say nothing about Devdas as I am writing to him separately. Tea and coffee, if they are strong, are poison for a convalescing patient. Tea made after the Chinese fashion is likely to be harmless. You know how it is made, do you not?
 The note you refer to from S. Sahai and Rajen Babu I do not find at all. It must have been left there. For the time being at any rate my post both outgoing and ingoing is again in order.
 For the past week I have replaced chapatis with bananas  of which I take 4 daily. This I did to avoid constipation which seemed to be coming. I feel better. The result of course is that there is little salt in the food now. I take none with oranges which I am taking. I retain a vegetable on which I pour the evening milk.
Love from us all.

     LETTER TO MATHURADAS PURUSHOTTAM   August 	7, 1932  CHI. 	MATHURADAS,  	I got your letter. I have preserved your letter about the cup.libtech_616_footnoteAt present all three of us are trying our best to 	spin fine yarn. Mahadev has reached nearly 80 counts, while Sardar 	and I are between 30 and  	40. When we have reached our target, we will use the cup and I will 	then let you know the result.  	The following points should be considered in regard to dress- making 	for yajna. (1) What Kind of clothes can be stitched in the 	shortest time. (2) What kind of clothes will be sold most. (3) What 	kind of clothes women can stitch more easily and what kind of 	clothes men can stitch more easily. (4) Whether this scheme includes    
 embroidery and knitting. (5) Whether to cater to the needs of the rich also or only of the poor. (6) Scope of machine-sewing and of hand- sewing, etc., etc. The subject is an interesting one and is also of practi- cal benefit. It requires very careful thinking. If at present, however, you concentrate on spinning, pay less attention to sewing. Think over it when you have no other work and make experiments yourself. Mithubehn and Perinbehn have done very good work in this field. But I know that your plan is much wider than theirs. If it can be implemented fully and if people respond to it, no cloth can compete with khadi. But at present your work is improvement of spinning. Give as much time to sewing as you can spare for it. Concentration on one work helps one to attain moksha, but to attempt many things at a time is self-indulgence.
 As regards your relations with Motibehn, you should first examine your own mind. Do you still wish to enjoy pleasures of the flesh? If you have firmly resolved in your mind that you do not wish to do so, you should inform Motibehn and other friends about your resolution. That will certainly shock Motibehn, but your firmness will have an electric effect on her. Firmness means that you will remain steadfast in your resolution even if Motibehn loses her reason or dies. You should also be convinced that the good of you both lies in such firmness on your part. If, however, you have not reached this degree of firmness, give up arguing with Motibehn and silently live with her as other husbands live with their wives and exercise what self-control you can while doing so. If you do that, nobody will have a right to criticize you. Everybody can advance only within the limit of his capacity. In any case you will deserve criticism if you remain undecided and deceive yourself, your friends and the world. If you save yourself from such a position, everything will be well in the end. Do not think too much and get confused. You have spent a good many years in thinking. Come to a definite decision without further hesitation, and you will then enjoy complete peace of mind.
 This is the meaning of the Gita verse:“The attitude, in  this matter, springing, as it does, from fixed resolve is but one, O Kurunandana”libtech_617_footnote
 Think over it and the verses which immediately follow. You will understand this letter more clearly then.

     LETTER TO ASHRAM BOYS AND GIRLS   August 	7, 1932  DEAR 	BOYS AND GIRLS,  	The story relating to the significance of the ekadashi is 	interesting. But we observe the ekadashi in a different 	manner.  	For us, the ekadashi should be a voluntary vow observed both 	physically and mentally, and its aim should be self-purification. 	When a person who is ill does not eat, his aim is to cure his 	illness and not to observe a fast. Similarly, a poor man also who 	does not eat because he has no food does not observe a fast thereby.

  A LETTERlibtech_629_footnote 
 August 7, 1932
 I cannot share your sorrow. Your wife has been released from suffering. She has died at such a time and in such a manner that we should envy her death. Why do you feel that you are left an orphan? Only a person who is without God’s protection may regard himself as an orphan. But God protects everybody. Hence it is only because of our utter ignorance that we regard ourselves as orphans. The armour which protected you was neither Mani nor your wife. Our true armour is not our relations, but our faith in God. The capacity of the human body to endure is much less than that of even a glass bangle. The latter will remain in tact for hundreds of years if it is carefully preserved. The human body, on the other hand, does not endure beyond a certain limit however cerefully it is looked after, and even within that limit it may perish at any moment. Why should we put our trust in such a brittle thing? You should absorb yourself completely in the Ashram work and think about nothing else. You need not at all worry about Mangala, who is now a girl of six years. You yourself should look after her and you should also teach Shanti and Jekor to look after themselves. Probably you do not know that from her
 
 childhood Rukhibehnlibtech_630_footnotewas brought up by Maganlal, though Santok was living. There was little hope that she would live. She could hardly even breathe. Maganlal used to bathe this girl, dress her hair, make her sit down beside him at mealtime and feed her, and he also looked after his other childern. And still he did more work by way of service than anybody else. The finest kitchen-garden was nurtured by him. In Phoenix he was the first to grow a rose. When he struck with his spade to dig some hard part of the compound, one felt as if there was a tremor in the ground. You can do all that Maganlal could. In all this, I have made no mention of his great artistic ability and his learning. He had confidence in himself and faith in his work. God had blessed him with a strong body. It broke down at last only because of the heavy burden of the Ashram work and his stoic habits. I believe, however, that in his short life Maganlal did as much work as another man might do in a hundred or several hundred years. I have cited his example to you because you knew him and it was his love which had drawn you to the Ashram. Let his memory, if nothing else, help you to overcome your present helplessness and gloom. I don’t believe even one person in a hundred thousand in the country has the means which you command.

  A LETTER 
 August 7, 1932
 To us, all useful work is good and worth doing. Thus tanning, carpentry, cleaning lavatories, farm work, weaving, cooking, grazing cattle and all similar types of work are of equal value. If I could persuade the people, I would have all kinds of work rewarded equally, the work of the educated and of the uneducated, the clerk’s work and the scavenger’s. Probably you know that, in order to examine the problem from this point of view, the account of work in the Ashram is being kept only in terms of hours. If, therefore, you are not getting sufficient yarn for weaving just now, please do not believe that you are doing work of less importance than farming or similar other work.

The field of service is so vast that it can give opportunities to countless men and women. Doesn’t this include everything?

 I got your letter. It is natural that we should feel grieved at the death of Doctor. For himself, it was a release from suffering. I have expressed my opinion and told Ratilal and Champa that it is not necessary for them to go to Rangoon. In any case I will write to Rangoon. I do not know whether there is a will. I think that safety and good sense lie in trusting Chhaganlal. All the same, you may take the advice of Nanalal or anybody else in whose judgment you have confidence. My views will probably seem impractical to you, but to me they appear most practical.
I believe that the interests of Champa and Ratilal are safe.
 I hope Mother has recovered. My respectful greetings to her.

  	I got your letter. It is the experience of most doctors that sweet 	curds will harm nobody. Sweet curds mean curds which have no taste 	of sourness at all. Everybody can digest such curds. If there is the 	slighest taste of sourness, add some soda bicarb. This will cause 	effervescence and remove the acidity. I do this every day. Fruits 	also will do no harm if they are sweet. Mosambis are always 	sweet, and so are the small variety of grapes. Eat all these things 	in small quantities. If they do not agree, you may stop them.

          CHI. 	MANU,   LETTER TO MANSHANKAR J. TRIVEDI   August 	10, 1932 
 I 	got your letter after a long delay.  	Now that you are studying, you should cease thinking about other 	things and complete the course. If after thinking carefully about 	the cruelty practised in the different fields of your study, you can 	prove that it is not necessary to perform such experiments on 	animals, you may do so when you are qualified for such an attempt. 	Some doctors themselves have opposed this practice.  	I see that you are making good use of your time. Try to under- stand 	and follow the truth in the saying: “Study without reflec-tion is 	useless.” We do not increase our knowledge merely  by  reading 	books; we can increase it only by reflecting over what we read and 	by digesting it.  	All three of us are well. Sardar is studying Sanskrit. Shouldn’t 	his example be a great source of inspiration to a young man?  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 1006     LETTER TO RAMDAS GANDHIlibtech_639_footnote   August 	11, 1932  	I understand that you have not yet resolved to give up cinnamon and 	cloves. I intend to write to Nimu. If she has already taken a vow, I 	will not press her to give it up. I will only explain what her 	dharma is.  I think that one should not press anybody to give up a 	vow like this. The effect of such persuasion on a person is to tempt 	him to give up his firmness and in consequence his mind becomes 	weak. I do not regret the strictness which  I   imposed  on  the   	occasions  which  you    
 mention. It was justified at that time. Now I feel the slightest degree of strictness to be as heavy as the weight of the Himalayas. Formerly, I had to fast in order to make people do what I can now persuade them to do with a mere rebuke; and other people, too, had to act more or less similarly. If I continue to act as I used to do, I would be a cruel man. Does this mean that others also have advanced, as I have done? We have no reason to believe this. But since I can now influence people close to me, nothing more is necessary. In other words, you need not yourself be strict with Nimu or yourself, for I am here to keep a strict watch. After my death, all of you will have to be vigilant. It is because of this state of affairs that we often find laxity creeping in when I am away. That is so all over the world. We should, therefore, learn to be fully vigilant in our own lives. At present we may be growing as a creeper does with the support of a tree. But this is a form of dependence. We should shake it off and learn to stand on our own feet. The cause of the electric effect on Nimu is what I explained above. Conditions were not the same at the time of my life which you remember, because the atmosphere then was not responsive. It had not been purified sufficiently to be so. If I were to write anything harsh to Nimu, she would feel miserable. Do you now understand the reason for my liberal attitude? There was the same love behind the strictness of the past as there is behind the liberal attitude of the present. What you say, however, is quite correct. It would certainly be bad if anybody misunderstood my liberal attitude and became lax. The reason for entertaining such fear is different. It is that I have become less exacting to myself. My former strictness has gone. The body does not obey me. I naturally feel reluctant to ask others to do what I myself cannot. I, therefore, often told the inmates  of the Ashram that I was no longer fit to be in charge of it. The gate-keeper who guards the Ashram must be an ever vigilant and strong man. Formerly, I used to work as much as anybody else did, and so the others, too, had to keep pace with me. But now they do not have the example of my work. They have to follow my preaching. It is not surprising, therefore, that you see laxity in the atmosphere. I hope you have understood all this fully.
 I like your vigilance. In this case, however, you should not be strict with Nimu. My ideas about the relations between husband and wife have changed of course. I would not like any of you to behave towards his wife as I did towards Ba. She has lost nothing through my strictness, of course, for I never regarded her as my property. I always
 had love and respect for her. I only wished to see her grow spiritually. However, she could not be angry with me, whereas I could with her. I did not give her the same freedom of action which I enjoyed and she did not have the capacity to exercise it either. Hindu women never have such capacity. That is a defect of Hindu society. I, therefore, wish that you should treat Nimu as having the same freedom which you have. I once wrotelibtech_640_footnotelibtech_641_footnoteto her and asked her jestingly not to regard herself as dependent and harass you for every little thing. She replied saying that she was dependent and that you knew that it was so. The language is mine, but this is the meaning of what she said. This sort of dependence ought to be removed. If she wants a servant, why should she ask you? She can ask Narandas to provide one and may even quarrel with him on that issue. This is but a trivial example. She should, however, be free in matters which concern herself. If you wish to enjoy immoral pleasure with another woman, you will not be afraid of Nimu. That you may be held back by your love for Nimu is another matter. Similarly, Nimu should be free to enjoy immoral pleasure with another man without any fear. Mutual love may save a couple from sin, but there should be no fear of each other. I began to teach this [equality and freedom] only in the Ashram. My behaviour towards Ba at Sabarmati progressively became in line with this attitude, and the result was that she changed. Her old fear of me has disappeared mostly, if not completely. Even if I feel angry with her, I turn the anger on myself. The cause of anger is my attachment to her. This is an important change which has taken place in me and it has had beautiful results. The results will be more beautiful only if my love becomes purer still. Numberless women trust me spontaneously. I am sure that the reason of that is my love and respect for them. Invisibly they produce an effect all the time.

         MY 	DEAR AMTUL,   LETTER TO AMTUSSALAAM   August 	12, 1932 
  	I have your letter. There was nothing to hide from anyone in your 	letter. I would like all girls and women to shed this false shame 	about the monthly sickness. There may be a sense of shame on the 	part of those who want to indulge their animal passions and treat 	the monthly business in terms of sexuality. But those who want to 	lead a life of continence should discuss this sickness as any other 	sickness. Now for the remedy. In the first place you should take 	perfect rest as soon as there is any symptom of the sickness coming 	and rest should be continued whilst there is the slightest 	discharge. During the free days of the month regular sitz-baths 	should be taken as also hip-baths in order to avoid undue discharge 	or a discharge beyond three days in pains. There should [be] no 	pains during the sickness. If there the treatment does not answer, 	you should allow the womb to be exa- mined by a doctor. On this 	matter you should consult Mrs. Lazarus and be guided by her. She is 	likely to be able to tell you what to do.      
 You should take Premabehn into your confidence. She does not know much about this. But you two can put your heads together and read up the literature on the subject. If you don’t know what sitz-baths are and if Prema also does not, you should read up Kuhne’s book. If you master the secret of this illness, you can impart it to the other girls. It is the most fruitful source of the diseases of women. A false sense of shame prevents girls from understanding the sickness and regulating it in the proper manner. It is sinful to hide this thing and then suffer untold miseries. Herewith letterlibtech_645_footnotelibtech_646_footnotefor Dr. Sharma.

          CHI. 	PREMA,   LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK   August 	12, 1932 
  	The following books are required for parachure Shastri. Send those 	from among them which you have there. I will get the others from 	elsewhere. See if you can send them soon. Give them to Mani- behn or 	to Nandubehnlibtech_649_footnotelibtech_650_footnote. Either will send them to Dahyabhai. Para- chure 	Shastri was in the Ashram once. He is a man of great learning. He is 	in this jail just now. He has been suffering from leprosy. That is 	why I am in a hurry to send the books to him. He spins daily. I am 	not permitted to see him, but can write to him. His wife, too, is 	ill and confined to bed. She is outside. The books are: (1) 	Imitation of Christ,  	(2) Works of Swami Vivekananda (whichever volumes we have), (3) 	Works of Sister Nivedita (whichever volumes we have), (4) Essays of 	Tolstoy, (5) Vyakarana Mahabhashya, (6) Yajurveda Bhashya, 	(7) Dispensations of Keshab Chandra Sen.  	Since Parachure Shastri has lived in the Ashram, he informs me that 	the last three are available there. He seems to have read them while 	he was there.  	I got your letter. You seem to believe that I could write an 	interesting letter whenever I wished to. But you see now that that 	is    
 not true. I cannot even judge which letter is interesting and which is dull. I am telling the truth. Moreover, who can say that the letter which you think interesting is in fact so? If there is an independent yardstick for judging whether or not a thing is interesting, God seems to have kept it under lock and key. On this earth, therefore, everyone has his or her own yardstick for this purpose. If I tried to come up to your standard, wouldn’t I be in a miserable plight? All my time would be taken up in trying to succeed in the effort. Should I start writing a letter all over again, or a third time, for fear that what I had written might be uninteresting? And if I must write interesting letters to you, I must write similar letters to others. And the result, bankruptcy!!!  Instead of that, I follow a simple rule. Without considering whether the letter will be interesting or not, I should write what I think in such language as I can command. But you are foolish, and proud too. How can you ever appreciate this simple reasoning? And now I see that you claim to be omniscient. Any wise thing I try to explain to you, you seem to know it. But pause a little. One who believes in an idea or knows it to be true but cannot act on it does not in fact know it, or knows it in a sense and yet does not know it. Hence, as long as you go on writing foolish things, get angry and feel proud, you will remain foolish in my eyes. This does not mean that you should not let your pride, anger and foolishness be seen in your letters. As long as you have them in you, you must express them. The value of your letters lies in letting yourself be seen as you are. I don’t mind your remaining foolish. But you must overcome your anger and be a little less proud. It is impossible to get rid of pride altogether.
 You cite the instance of Narada. But do you know the real significance of his statement?libtech_651_footnoteBy all means worship a personal form in the manner in which he did. Such worship is proper. His Krishna is as historical as the God in Vaikunthalibtech_652_footnote. Narada’s God  dwelt  in  the temple of his imagination. That Narada is alive today, and so is his Krishna, for both live for ever in our imagination. According to me, imagination is superior to historical fact. This is the only possible meaning of Tulsidas’s statement that the name Rama is more potent than the person Rama.
 Is it not because you are caught in the whirlpool of worship of the individual that you worry me again and again? You have not been
 
 
 able to free me from worries regarding the Ashram. Narandas has succeeded in doing So. I can cite instances of other persons too. They also worship persons, who doesn’t? But, ultimately, they go beyond the person and learn to worship his virtues, that is, his creations. We forgot this priceless truth and, in our ignorance, we taught women to burn themselves on the pyre of their husbands. That is worship of the person taken to its extreme!! The real duty of a loyal wife is to immor- talize in herself her husband’s life-work. If we purify the relationship of husband and wife of sex and banish from it the distinction of gender, this ideal will apply to every woman in the world, whatever her state may be. In other words, love for the husband merges in love of God. But I leave this subject now.
 Why are you upset by the news that Dhiru is arriving? Have confidence that you will be able to control him too; have that much faith in yourself. Let the immortal statement, “Love conquers all”, sink into your heart. We should be pleased whoever may arrive. Our only wish is to serve everyone as best as we can. Why don’t you have faith that, if the other children have become wellbehaved, under their influence Dhiru also will become like them? It is also possible that Dhiru has become a wise boy now. Personally, I have always hoped much from him.
 You should dedicate your whole life to the service of the girls. If they do not talk frankly about themselves to anyone, they are bound to fall ill. Read my letter to Anandi. If she lets you have that letter, all the other girls who have grown up should be asked to read it.
 I have never observed from my own experience that bananas give rise to gas. I have consumed more bananas than anybody else is likely to have done. For many years they were my chief food. I neither took milk nor ate bread. My diet consisted of bananas, olive oil, ground-nut and lemon. However, I never suffered from gas. After many years, I have started eating them again. I observe no ill effects. You must, of course, observe one rule in eating them. Either bananas should be cooked or they should be completely ripe. An unripe banana is pure starch, and I saw in Gopal Rao’s experiment that starch should not be eaten uncooked. Hence, one should not eat bananas which have not become soft or ripe. They will become ripe if kept aside for two or three days. If you want to eat bananas before they have become ripe, you should either roast them or boil them in water.
 The book which you read may have been published in 1924, but the theory which it mentions has become outdated.
 I had opponents in the past and have them even today. But I have never felt angry with them. I have not wished them ill even in my dreams. The result has been that many opponents have become friends. No one’s opposition has had any effect on me. On three occasions they sought to take my very life, but I am still alive. This does not mean that no opponent would ever succeed against me in his plan. Whether he succeeds or does not is no concern of mine. My dharma lies in wishing well even to them, and serving them whenever an opportunity offers itself. I have tried to live up to this principle to the best of my ability. I think this thing is part of my nature.
 I get physically tired by the worship of vast crowds. It has never made me happy, nor have I ever felt that I was worthy of it. On the contrary, I have always been conscious of my unworthiness. I do not remember to have ever hungered for honour. I always want work. I have tried my best to make people who honour me do work, and, when they refused to work, I have run away from their honour. I will feel myself blessed only when I reach my goal. But, as the saying goes, will that day ever dawn?
 It is not necessary to cultivate pride or contempt in order that one may be able to stand against the world. Jesus stood against the world, Buddha stood against his times and Prahlada also acted in the same way. All of them were humility incarnate. To have such humility, one must have faith in oneself and in God. Those who have opposed the world with pride have ultimately fallen. Sometimes your pride and your anger are only pretended. But even such pretence in an evil thing. It may ultimately become a habit and often gives cause for unnecessary misunderstanding. One should be very careful in one’s conduct so as to guard against such possibilities. I think it impossible for anyone to have the strength to stand alone against the world at a critical hour unless he or she has the utmost humility. And it is such strength which has any value at all. It is tested only at such a time. Many of those whom the world has believed to be brave, it had no opportunity of judging whether they were really so. Now read my letter to Amtulbehn too.

  LETTER TO PARASRAM MEHROTRA 
 August 13, 1932
 CHI. PARASRAM,
 In India also, if our leaders live long they would rise very high. I have not read Aristotle’s writings and have read very little even of Plato’s I can, therefore, say nothing about their ideas.
 All the virtues mentioned by you are essential for universal service.
 Children need good company. Tulsidas has explained the mean- ing of good company.
 I have not read the article in The Times of India.
 Anybody who has tasted the sweetness of honey in my company will taste similar sweetness wherever he goes, for he will find even bitter things sweet.
 I did not receive the Anantapur report. The same thing seems to have happened regarding the takli. I will inquire.
 I do not know who Emerson was. Don’t you know that my reading is more limited than even that of a good matriculate?
 Anybody who seeks happiness in his own mind should have the same qualities as the sthitaprajnalibtech_653_footnotedescribed in Chapter  II  [of  the Gita]. I have not read L’Allegrolibtech_654_footnoteand Il Penserosolibtech_655_footnotelibtech_656_footnoteeither.
My ignorance has been tested fairly well. But I do not mind.

There was some problem about my letterlibtech_657_footnote, and that is why you got it late by some days.  	It was good that you sent me your daily programme. What subjects do 	you study? I will make one suggestion. I see no time fixed for 	prayer in your programme. Immediately after rising in the  morning 	and brushing your teeth, you must sit down quietly and praywith 	complete concentration. And you should do the same when retiring. 	Prayer is to the soul what food is to the body. The body can live 	for some days without food. A few days’ fast may even benefit it. 	There can be no fast in regard to prayer. one who believes in the 	existence of the soul cannot do without prayer even for one day.

  READING AND REFLECTION—Ilibtech_660_footnote 
 August 14, 1932
 We are taught at school: “Studying without thinking is useless.” This is literally true. Love of reading is good. Those who are prevented by lethargy from reading and studying have certainly dull minds. But those also who merely read and never reflect on what they read remain more or less dull. Some of them lose their eyesight in the bargain. Reading without reflecting is only a kind of mental disease.
 Many of us read in that manner. They read but never reflect on what they read, much less put it in practice. We should, therefore, read less, but think over what we read and put it in practice. We may reject what we discover from experience to be unsuitable, and go on with the rest. Persons who follow this method will satisfy their needs with less reading, save much time and become fit for creative and responsible work.
 Another benefit which accrues to persons who learn to think is worth nothing. One cannot always get books to read or get time to read them. Persons to whom reading has become a habit are known to have gone crazy when they could not read. If, however, one forms the habit of thinking, the book of thoughts is always available to one, andthere will then be no danger of one becoming crazy when not able to read.
 I have deliberately used the phrase to “learn to think”. That way lots of people think, carelessly and unprofitably.  This  is  only  a form of madness. Some get caught in futile speculation and, overcome with despair, even kill themselves. This is not the kind of thinking I am advising. What I am advising here is only that people should reflect over what they read. Suppose we here or read a bhajan today. We should then reflect over it. We should try to discover its deeper meaning and think what we should accept from it and what we should reject. We should see if there is any error in its idea. If we have not understood its meaning, we should make an effort to understand it. This is called systematic thinking. I have given the simplest illus- tration. Everybody should apply it to his own case and draw necessary conclusions for himself, and may thus progress. One who follows this

          CHI. 	BHAU,   LETTER TO BHAU PANSE     August 	14, 1932 
  	For your constipation, you should immediately go and consult Dr. 	Talwalkar. It must be cured. I think that a  bhaktalibtech_661_footnotewith a personal motive is one who asks for the 	fulfilment of some wish. If I pray to God daily for the success of 	the khadi programme, I would be a bhakta with a personal 	motive.  	Arnold believes  that  the  verse  beginning  with  agnirjyotihlibtech_662_footnoteis interpolated. I also believe that it may be 	so. If we take it in its literal sense I cannot understand its 	significance. The general purport is clear enough. The first is the 	path of knowledge and the second is the opposite of that. The 	reference to the periods of six months is a metaphor. I interpret 	the verse in this manner for my own satisfaction. The difficulty 	which you experience when praying is experienced by everybody (in 	the beginning). But perseverance will help you to overcome both the 	difficulties. Despite the difficulties, you should keep up the 	practice of praying. One day you will learn to concen- trate. We 	experience such difficulties because we do not feel the same hunger 	for prayer as we do for food. In other words, we do not have the 	same conviction about the existence of the soul as we have about 	that of the body.  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : G.N. 6734. Also C.W. 4477.

 Caste distinctions are not respected in the Ashram because they are not part of dharma. They have no connection with the Hindu dharma. It is sinful to regard anybody as higher or lower. All of us are equal. We are polluted by sin, never by human beings. One who wishes to serve cannot look upon anybody as higher or lower. The belief in such distinctions is a blot on Hinduism. We should remove it.

 Do not consider anything wrong unless your heart pronounces it as such. Ultimately we have no other yardstick, that is why we try to keep our hearts pure. The wicked man imputes rightness  to  sin because his heart is impure. However it be, he continues to act sinfully till he is enlightened. No one but yourself can judge what is good for you. I can tell you only this much that we have to tread the path of truth and non-violence and to that end we must observe some rules and regulations.

  A LETTER 
 August 14, 1932
 One’s respective dharma towards one’s self, family, nation and the world cannot be divided into watertight compartments. The harm done to oneself or one’s family cannot bring about the good of the nation. Similarly one cannot benefit the nation by acting against the world at large. Thus the purport is that we must sacrifice ourselves in the interest of the family, the family must do so for the nation and the nation for the world. But the sacrifice has to be pure. Therefore it all starts from self-purification. When the heart is pure, from moment to moment one’s duty becomes apparent effortlessly.

  LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI 
 August 11/15, 1932
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got your mail in due time. I send with this a beautiful letter received from a ladylibtech_671_footnoteliving in an ashram like ours in Italy. All the workers in that Ashram are women. The letter will give you some idea of the devotion and patience with which they work. Explain  its contents to all the inmates, particularly to the women. Tell them at the same time about St. Francis. Mahadev once wrote a sketch of his life for Navajivan. Maybe you have read it. I have requested these ladies to write a letter directly to the Ashram. If you get any letter from them, reply to it. If, on reading this letter, you wish to write to them immediately, you may do so without waiting for a letter from them. But please don’t think that you must write. For all I know, they may have written a letter directly to the Ashram.
 You seem to have had excessive rains there. It is practically the same here, though to a much lesser degree. The sky is clearing fairly well now.
 My yarn was tested today and it was found that with the Gandiva wheel I have been able to go up to 53 counts. Mahadev has gone up
 
 to 80 counts, and Vallabhbhai has reached at least 40. I think such results can be achieved easily only on the Gandiva wheel. There is still room for improvements in it to make it suitable for spinning fine yarn. A few such improvements are being made by us here in the jail. Anybody who wishes to spin fine yarn must concentrate all his attention when he is spinning and have a supply of good slivers. The point is that one can spin fine yarn only if one pays careful attention to every detail. I feel more certain every day that, if we try to spin yarn of the best possible quality and the highest possible count, we shall be able to make many discoveries resulting in improvement in the quality of all yarn, and our own work will also become very methodical and neat. If we wish to bring this about, everybody who wishes to spin fine yarn should start using the Gandiva wheel. However, it is for you and the others there to decide about this after a careful discussion. Though my experience with this wheel issuffi- ciently long, I don’t attach much importance to it. It will count only if it is unhesitatingly supported by others who also have spun on it. I attach value to my experience only as a guide to others. So far no harm seems to have been done to my elbow by spinning on the Gandiva wheel. I will use the hand as long as it gives service. If it fails,   I will go back to the Magan spinning-wheel. It will be a very easy thing for you to spin on the Gandiva wheel. I know that you draw the threads with the right hand. It is very easy to do this on the Gandiva wheel. If no bend has been made in the groove in the spindle-bearer, all that is necessary is to change the direction in which the spindle points. If, however, a groove is already there, you should fit another spindle-bearer with the bend pointing in the desired direction. Since the spindle-bearer in my wheel has a bend, it is easier to wind the yarn firmly. I spun the yarn of 53 counts with slivers received from Chhakkaddas. If I don’t write to him this time, please tell him that the slivers sent by him have proved very useful.
I hope Virsinh’s fever has left him, and that Amtul also is better.
 I received the slivers sent by Chhakkaddas, the Urdu books and the French dictionary. Shankarbhai’s [arm] has been in plaster long enough. I guess from this that the injury was quite serious. I hope the plaster has been removed now.
 It is really a release for Narmada. What is Dhirsinh’s caste? Who will pay the sum of Rs. 650? Or can Narmada’s relations bear the
 burden? I ask this only for my information. I think Narmada has won her freedom fairly cheaply.
 If Ratubhai takes any step regarding the affairs of Doctor, please write to me immediately even if it is not your day for writing to me. If you have learnt now who are there in Rangoon, please let me know that too.
 My weight varies from time to time by about one or one and a half pounds either way. I have not tried to discover if there is any particular reason for it. There is no need to try. I have omitted rotli from my diet for the last ten days or so because of a slight tendency to constipation. Since then I have been eating four to six bananas for one of the meals, with milk and one spoonful of almond paste. For the other meal I eat some vegetable, as when I used to eat rotli. I eat it mixed with milk, and generally at both meals I also take mosambis or oranges. This diet has cured constipation. This time the weight was
 resulted in loss of weight.There is no change in the condition of the elbow. I received the samples of yarn spun by Keshu and Abbas. Both were excellent. I will preserve them carefully. On which type of spinning-wheel did Abbas spin this yarn? I have examined the statement of work done by the inmates as yajna though I have not studied it very carefully. If we want trained spinners to spin yarn of not less than 20 counts, we shall have to fix the limit fairly higher than that. Hardly anybody will fall below 20 then. If a person does not wish to fall below the lowest step, he must stand five to ten steps above the lowest. Nothing in this world remains on a fixed level for ever. Nobody, therefore, can maintain himself on the lowest level fixed. And so if one does not advance, one must fall. In the method for learning which I have recommendedlibtech_672_footnotelibtech_673_footnoteit is not necessay for people to make a special effort to spare time for one another. In an institution where the necessary atmosphere has been created, the inmates will spontaneously give time to one another for such a purpose. Just as nobody makes an effort to spare time for eating but gives time to it as a matter of course, so also this matter of giving time to one another should be spontaneous. Anybody who has wealth of any kind should willingly share it with his neighbours who are without it. But before such a habit becomes ingrained in us, it may be becessary, as you suggest, for the inmates to reserve some time for the purpose. Hence,
 
 if anybody has something with him which he can share with others, the time when he can do so must be mentioned in our daily time- table.
 You did very well in inquiring of Krishnadas if he needed help. Regarding Nimu, I will write to her. Read the letter which I write. if she has taken a solemn vow,libtech_674_footnoteI will not press her to give it up. If one gives up a vow, though it involves no sin, one’s strength for making vows, that is, power of determination, diminishes. If there is a demand for copies of Anasaktiyoga, I see no harm in getting them printed in any press which you think suitable. If you think you cannot meet the demand, you should keep silent just now. I think there will be no harm in getting the discourses printed. If, however, you do that, they should be carefully revised in proof. I don’t revise things carefully before sending them. Besides, my handwriting is bad. It is likely, therefore, that some bad errors will have been made. The discourses which I write now are addressed to the small circle of the Ashram inmates. Appa seems to have done very fine work. You have done right in asking Hariyomal to leave.
 August 14, 1932 I did not see any letter from Narayanappa. If, therefore, he inquires for my reply, tell him that I did not receive his letter. Read
my letter to Anandi and Amtul regarding the children.

 Mahadev tells me that I have not told you yet about Vallabhbhai studying Sanskrit. I think I did mention it. These days he is simply engrossed in that study. Whenever he gets any time,  he  studies Sanskrit or thinks about it. He gives about five hours to it. He has finished the five books of Pandit Satavlekar, and has now added five new verses from the Gita to be studied daily. He has  completed Chapter I and is going on with Chapter II. This is how he started the study. There was a letter from Rajaji one day. He had mentioned in it having studied Sanskrit. That inspired Sardar. Five weeks have passed since this happened. Together with Sanskrit he started spinning too. He now spins with perfect concentration. The speed  is  increasing every day. He has gone up to about 40 counts.

  	I pass your letter this time. It gets 33 libtech_676_footnote/ per cent 	marks. If you want even more than that, tell me. The letters are 	rather small, but it does not matter. But they are not uniform. 	There are a few verses by Ramdaslibtech_677_footnotelibtech_678_footnoteon 	the art of good handwriting. Have you read the poem? If you have 	not, get from the Ashram.

  	I believe in both Gods, the one that serves us and the one that we 	serve. It cannot be that we should render service and should not 	receive service of any kind. But both Gods are of our imagining. 	There is only one God who is real. The real God is beyond  	conception. He neither serves nor receives service. He cannot be 	described by any epithets, being not an external power but something 	dwelling in our heart. Since we do not understand the ways of God, 	we     
 have necessarily to think of a power beyond our conception. And the moment we think of it, the God of our imagining is born. The fact is that belief in God is a function not of the intellect but of faith. Reasoning is of little help to us in this matter and once we accept God the ways of the world cease to bother us. Then we have to accept that no creation of God can be purposeless. Beyond this I cannot go.

  LETTER TO FELLOW PRISONERS 
 August 15, 1932 For those who find it difficult to concentrate their mind on their studies, it is a great help to forget the outside world altogether. If a
dying man has his heart in the world, he fails to attain release, he is
 unhappy himself and is the cause of unhappiness in others; the same is the case with a prisoner in jail who should cease to think of the outside world; for imprisonment means civil death. One who is civilly dead looks mad himself and maddens others about him if he pokes his nose into the outside world. This prescription of mine is no new discovery. [John] Bunyan could not have produced his immortal worklibtech_680_footnoteand   Lokamanya   Tilak   Gitarahasya   if   in   prison   they   had continued to worry about the outside world.

  A LETTER 
 August 15, 1932
 Prayer and brahmacharya are not things of the same kind. Brahmacharya is one of the five cardinal vows, and prayer is a means of being able to observe them. I have said a great deal to explain the necessity of brahmacharya. But when I tried to think how one can observe it, I discovered a powerful means in prayer. For him who has realized the value of prayer and is able to pray with concentration, brahmacharya becomes quite easy to observe.
 
 My idea of a doctor is a person who has acquired a good knowledge of his profession and gives the benefit of that knowledge to the people without charging fees. For his livelihood, he should take up some other work. Or he may live on whatever little the people give him voluntarily, but never regard it as fee for his services. In an ideal state of affairs, I would fix an annual allowance to be paid to such voluntary workers, in addition to which they would be permitted to charge or accept nothing either from the rich or the poor.
Japayajna means repeating the Name, so far as I can judge.
 It is difficult to find how much exactly one should eat, but it is easy to eat little, that is to say, resolutely to eat less than one needs, and that is the better way.
 One who would keep the vow of truth should not think a single thought which he would hide from the world. He should not mind if the world comes to know even his silly ideas. What he should worry over is his silly thoughts, his sins. Members of the Ashram are worried by the fear that someone else might read their diary, because they wish to appear better than they are. But when a man does not care even if the whole world looks into his diary, why should he hide it from his wife?
The only limit to the keeping of the vow is that of our capacity.
 So long as there is the distinction of meum and teum between friends and even between husband and wife, since those chained to a body cannot get over it, each may not take anything belonging to the other without permission. Your intention that you will put it again in its original place does not meet the case, if only because you can never be sure that you will live long enough to carry it out or that the thing will not be stolen while it is still in your charge. In observing this rule, we should not mind if we are accused of pedantry and even worse on that account.

  A LETTER 
 August 15, 1932
 Achara means the outward mode of living and it can change from time to time.libtech_681_footnoteThe rules of inner living must remain the same; that is, one should cling to truth, ahimsa, etc. It trying to follow them, we may change the rules of outward mode of living whenever necessary. We need not cling to anything, saying or believing that according to the Shastras achara is the first step in dharma. All rules given in Sanskrit were not Shastra. Even the book entitled Manavdharmashastra is not really speaking a Shastra. Shastra is not anything written in a book. It should be a living thing. Hence the words of a wise man of good character whose actions are in accord with his speech are our Shastra. If we do not have any such lighthouse to guide us, what seems truth to us is our Shastra, provided our minds and hearts have been purified.

  LETTER TO PADMAJA NAIDU 
 August 16, 1932
 MY DEAR PADMAJA,
 Unlike the lotus the Lotus-born can write much  and  say nothing. For your letter occupies a fair space and tells me nothing except about myself. What I wanted to know was how you were keeping, what Lilamani was doing and how Father’s hospital, which you had showed me and where the prayers were offered, was doing. But you would not be Padmaja if you gave me credit for wanting to know all these family details instead of being told that I was by nature a wrinkled old slave-driver rather than a saint. Anyway for your credit let me slave-drive you to give me a decent letter giving me a proper budget of family news.
 I duly got the grapes and other fruit, also The Candle of Visionlibtech_684_footnote. For all these gifts thanks if you need them. Mother evidently forgot when she prompted you to buy the book for me that at her instance the poet had himself sent me his own copy.
Now be good and write.
 Sardar and Mahadev join me in sending you all much love.
 Yours,
 SLAVE-DRIVER

  LETTER TO BEHRAMJI KHAMBHATTA 
 August 16, 1932
 BHAISHRI KHAMBHATTA,
 I got your letter. I did not write my letter to you in order to discontinue your medicine but I wrote it to tell you that I had succeeded in getting possession of it. I do not worry whether the pain will be cured or not. I wished to use your oil because I knew that you had mixed your love with it. I will continue the massage till the bottle is exhausted and will not be in a hurry to stop it. How can I take sun- bath in this season? I will certainly take it as soon as the sky clears permanently. I have not tried cold packs, but I did apply mud-packs prepared with cold water. They did not help. The real difficulty is that the exact cause of the pain cannot be ascertained, and so we cannot be certain about the treatment either. The pain is not in the muscle but in the bone of the elbow. It is in the left elbow and is felt only when the bone is pressed or when the arm is moved in a certain manner. Otherwise I am not aware of it at all. Personally, I believe that this is a symptom of old age. If it is so, treatment is useless. However, the remedy suggested by you is completely harmless and I will not, therefore, discontinue it. I very much wish to request you to come over, but, since I have stopped seeing visitors I must obtain special permission for you to see me in your capacity as a bone-setter. I do not feel like doing that, for it means asking a favour and I would feel hurt if it was refused. For the present, therefore, I think it best to let things go on as they are doing.
 There is no trouble so far in my right elbow. The right thumb used to give pain when writing. I think it was cured merely through rest. I will give it more rest if it again starts paining. Mahadevmassages  it daily. I have filled this letter with the story of my pain. But it is not as serious as all that. I have written at such length, however, because I know that you like to hear the story.
 Andrews had gone to Germany to see the grandsonlibtech_685_footnoteof Gurudev there. He has now left us.
 I must prescribe for your lumbago. The only remedy for it is fasting, steam-bath and hip-bath. It is my experience till now that if
 
 these measures do not cure it, nothing else will. Fasting is an art. [Dr.] Mehta in Poona has some experience in the matter. Have you met him at any time? I have had no personal experience of him, but had it in the case of a Sindhi friend’s wife who was put under his care. Her complaint was of course of a different nature. I have mentioned her case just to fill the letter. Apart from fasting, and hip-bath, we have in the last resort the supreme remedy of surrender to the Lord.
 Blessings to you both from

  A LETTERlibtech_690_footnote

 You are right when you say that one should not trust a person who is not trustworthy. What I meant to say was that we should not regard anybody with suspicion. Just as we like other people to trust us, we also should trust them; and do not repent having trusted them if they prove themselves unworthy of our trust. Nobody has ever lost anything by trusting people. Those who betray the trust put in them always lose [something precious] in spite of ganing millions. We lose something only if our soul is stained. Wealth comes and goes, and we should not grieve when it goes.

DEAR FRIEND,
  LETTER TO RAMSAY MACDONALD 
 August 18, 1932
  	There can be no doubt that Sir Samuel Hoare has showed you and the 	Cabinet my letterlibtech_693_footnoteto 	him of 11th March on the question of the representation of 	“depressed” classes. That letter should be trea- ted as part of 	this letter and be read together with this.  	I have read the British Government’s decisionlibtech_694_footnoteon the represen- tation of minorities and have slept 	over it.libtech_695_footnoteIn 	pursuance of my letter to  Sir  Samuel  Hoare  and  my  declarationlibtech_696_footnoteat   the   meeting   of   the Minorities Committee 	of the Round Table Conference on 13th November, 1931, at St. James’ 	Palace, I have to resist your decision with my life.  	The only way I can do so is by declaring a perpetual fast unto death 	from food of any kind save water with or without salt and soda. This 	fast will cease if during its progress the British Government, of 	its own motion or under pressure of public opinion, revise their 	decision and withdraw their scheme of communal electorates for the 	“depre- ssed” classes, whose representatives should be elected 	by the general electorate under the common franchise no matter how 	wide it is.  	The proposed fast will come into operation in the ordinary course 	from the noon of 20th September next, unless the said decision is 	meanwhile revised in the manner suggested above.  	I am asking the authorities here to cable the text of this letter to 	you so as to give you ample notice. But in any case, I am leaving       
 sufficient time for this letter to reach you in time by the slowest route. I also ask that this letter and my letter to Sir Samuel Hoare, already referred to, be published at the earliest possible moment. On
my part, I have scrupulously observed the rule of the jail and have
 communicated my desire or the contents of the two letters to no one, save my two companions, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Sjt. Mahadev Desai. But I want, if you make it possible, public opinion  to  be affected by my letter. Hence, my request for their early publication.
 I regret the decision I have taken. But as a man of religion that I hold myself to be, I have no other course left open to me. As I have said in my letter to Sir Samuel Hoare, even if His Majesty’s Govern- ment decided to release me in order to save themselves the embarrass- ment, my fast will have to continue. For I cannot now hope to resist the decision by any other means. And I have no desire whatsoever to compass my release by any means other than honourable.
 It may be that my judgment is warped and that I am wholly in error in regarding separate electorates for the “depressed” classes as harmful to them or to Hinduism. If so, I am not likely to be in the right with reference to other parts of my philosophy of life. In that case my death by fasting will be at once a penance for my error and a lifting of a weight from off those numberless men and women who have childlike faith in my wisdom. Whereas if my judgment is right, as I have little doubt it is, the contemplated step is but the due fulfilment of the scheme of life, which I have tried for more than a quarter of a century, apparently not without considerable success.

 I 	got your letter. I 	got the rakhdi, but late by two days. I had, however, taken 	it 
 that I had received it on Monday.
 If bananas do not agree with you and yet you go on eating them, they will not benefit you. Every stomach has its own peculiarity.
 I have fully understood your analysis of the reasons why you get angry. Try to overcome your weakness. I know that you will succeed in overcoming it. I understood your meaning in that part of your letter which you had decided not to leave out. You did right in not leaving it out. There is great pride in not explaining one’s need to a person whom one loves, it does him injustice and puts a heavy burden on him. Civility and humility on our part save him from the trouble of ascertaining our need. This is the first lesson in civility. Learn it now.
Write to Krishnan Nair and tell him that I often think about him.
 You did very well in going to Rajkot. It seems your health requires such rest.
 Public opinion means the opinion of that section of society for which we care. It is our duty to respect it so long as it is not against morality.
 It is difficult to come to a just conclusion on the basis of the incident about the dhobi. Such conduct would certainly not meet with our approval in this age. Anyone who abandons his wife because of such criticism would be regarded as a cruel and unjust man. But I am not in a position to say what the poet’s intention was in the Ramayana in narrating that incident. We need not bother about that problem. I would not. I do not read even works like the Ramayana from that point of view.
 I believe that I must stop taking the freedom which I do with the girls if that shocks the inmates of the Ashram. There is no reason which makes it a moral duty for me to take such freedom, nor does my taking it violate morality. If, however, my refraining from it was likely to have an undesirable effect on the girls, I would reason with the inmates of the Ashram and continue to behave as I have been doing. If the girls themselves do not leave me, I would have  to  consider how to meet the situation. In any case, no one should follow my example and take similar freedom with them. The freedom one takes should be spontaneous. No one should consciously and deliberately decide to take such freedom from one fine morning and behave unnaturally; it would be quite improper if anyone did so. Narandas is free to act as he thinks proper. I would not wish even to
 criticize him. The truth is that anyone who takes even the  most innocent freedom with impure feelings falls into a pit and also drags others behind him. As long as the relations of men and women have not become natural in our society, one should certainly be careful in one’s behaviour. There is no royal road in such matters which all can follow. There is a good deal of clumsiness in your own behaviour. Your innocence saves you, but it is certainly not proper for you to be proud of it and obstinately to persist in your behaviour. There is thoughtlessness in doing so. You do not see today the harm which such behaviour may do. But you way have to repent one day. No one’s pride has endured for ever. One should not deliberately try to shock society, arguing that all conventional restrictions are bad. Have you now some idea of what public opinion means?
 Write to Dhurandhar and tell him that he should bear in mind what the Major told him. He will himself have to become a walking advertisement for asanas.libtech_697_footnote

     LETTER TO NANALAL K. JASANI   August 	19, 1932  BHAI 	NANALAL,  	I was waiting for a letter from you as we wait for rains in the 	months of jeth and Ashadha. I remembered you 	immediately the day I received the cable about Doctor’s last 	sleep, and also wrotelibtech_701_footnotelibtech_702_footnoteto you. I even wished at that time that you were with 	me, but I did not know you were in fact so near me. I did not even 	know where you would be, and so I enclosed that letter and another 	for Khimchand with my letterlibtech_703_footnotelibtech_704_footnoteto 	Manilal. In my letter to you I asked for your help and in the letter 	to Khimchand I cautioned him. I mentioned my distrust of him and 	other people’s too, but told him that Doctor had great trust in 	him and expressed my hope that he would not betray it. Maganlal had 	written me two long letters about Khimchand about the time he went 	to England, and I had also written to Doctor on the basis of those 	letters. Doctor had assured me in reply that Khimchand had turned 	over a new leaf and that there was no ground for distrusting him. 	You should not feel any hesitation now in taking a hand in the 	affrairs of the family. It is your duty at this juncture not to wait 	to be asked to intervene. Doctor’s trust in you can be seen even 	in  his  last instructions. Chhaganlal writes to me. His letters 	have been very good. He has promised to abide by my advice. He has 	expressed his own views, too, but he does not insist on their being 	acted upon. My letters are not likely to reach there before the 13th 	[proximo].  Hence,  without knowing what I want he has sent me a 	copy of the note which you had sent [to him]. All the letters and 	cables which I have received up to date from Chhaganlal after the 	passing away of Doctor can be described as perfectly satisfactory. 	If he seems to have an ulterior motive behind them, you should guide 	me. I am proceeding with full      
 trust in him. Ratilal Desailibtech_705_footnotelibtech_706_footnotehas written to me and told me that he does not share my trust. I have as yet made no suggestions beyond asking him to bring the accounts up to date. For the present, I am collecting all the relevant facts. I sent wireslibtech_707_footnotelibtech_708_footnoteto Ratilal, Champa and Manjula and dissuaded them from rushing to Rangoon. I wished to restrain Maganlal too, but I knew that he would not have that much patience, and also that he did not trust Chhaganlal. My own attitude has been that the shares of the three brothers should be separated. From what Chhaganlal writes, Doctor’s property seems to be very much less than I had thought. He says that there is practically no cash, and also expresses his distrust of Mayashankarlibtech_709_footnotelibtech_710_footnote. I think we should treat the last instructions of Doctor as his will. If, however, the total property is as enumerated by Chhaganlal and if there is no cash, how can we pay immediately the sums specified by Doctor? Please write to me frankly and in detail about all these matters. I feel unhappy that I am in jail at this juncture. But our wishes are not always fulfilled, and, therefore, we should do our duty as best as we can in the circumstances in which we are placed.

  	I was not at all vigilant. I could suspect others but I could not 	suspect you. Whether I was vigilant or not it was your duty to 	inform me immediately about the lapse. That way the lapse would have 	been to some extent remedied. But it is futile to think over the 	past.  	But now you should be able to sleep. Do not strain yourself to 	induce it. Sleep out in the open air. Be without any thoughts. Utter 	Ramanama if thoughts occur. If in spite of it, thoughts keep coming,       
 let that be so. Once you have decided that you must sleep then there is nothing to think about. Instead of worrying it is better to court failure. If there is discharge during sleep, do not fret. If you remain indifferent to it, I shall consider that you have learnt the lesson taught in the verse  If we have completely shut our minds to it, how are we responsible for an emission in sleep? All this can be addressed only to one following truth.
 You do not require wheat for putting on weight. However, do take it if you can digest it. If you find it difficult to digest wheat then take as much milk as you can and also fruit. For the moment do not think about the cost. Therapeutically milk and neem could be a complete diet, but this can be proved only by experiment. If you call free yourself from there I would like you to go to Almora for a few months. Discuss it with Vinoba.
 To show you how Suraj Bhan had a break-down, I send herewith his letter.
Now for the questions. I take it you have these with you.
  Yes 	and No. Because I 	am myself not 	clear as 	to what activity 	goes on for 	the whole day.  Both 	are alike, so 	I have 	not made an effort 	to find 	out the difference. 	There is scope 	for wide 	difference where the 	word ‘like’ is 	used. There is a 	great difference between 	the statements: 	‘gold is like 	brass’ and 	‘gold is 	brass’, and 	similarly between ‘a 	rope is 	like a snake’ 	and ‘a 	rope is 	a snake’. 	The first 	is a 	beautiful example of eloquence but 	is meaningless 	as usage. 	There is no eloquence 	in the 	second. There can 	be many usages. The 	reply to 	the first 	question covers that to 	the third.  Both 	the activities are different; 	so there 	can be no 	comparison. Only 	an experienced 	person can say more.  The 	brahmi state 	is positive, 	it is an affirmation. 	But it 	cannot be described as 	it can only 	be experienced. 
 ‘Sensitive’ means delicate and soft. It is good you introduced the children to me. A letter to them is enclosed.

   LETTER TO JANAKIDEVI BAJAJ  
 August 20, 1932
 CHI. JANAKIMAIYA,
 So at last you took the trouble to write a few lines with pencil. It seems you could not shake off your lethargy even in jail. I think it was a mistake [on the part of the magistrate] to have awarded you ‘A’ class. He should have awarded you ‘C’ class, so that you would have had to do hard work. Well, be as lethargic as you will, but see now that you recover your health completely. I am glad you are having an experience of Vinoba’s strict discipline. If you do not write regularly, bear in mind you will be punished. Did I tell you that the old blanket which you had made into a new one by stitching it on to khadi cloth had accompanied me to the Royal Palace?libtech_712_footnoteAnd it is with me in this jail, too. I am sure it will last for many more years yet.

  	You must have got my message. I hope you have calmed down now. 	Remember the second chapter [of the Gita].  	It seems best to me that you should entrust your money to the care 	of Narandas and let him make any arrangement about it which he 	thinks proper. You should know from him what arrangement he makes. 	Obtain receipts, etc., and preserve them, or give the original 	receipts to Narandas to preserve. You should consult Narandas 	himself for further guidance in this. I am writing to him. From here 	I cannot think of any other suggestion to make. I hope your health 	is all right. Send me a report of your work.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : G.N. 9570.

   LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL JOSHIlibtech_713_footnote  
 August 20, 1932 One of the many causes of illness is impatience. First the mind becomes   impatient,   and   then   the   body.  But   it   is   the universal
experience that ‘the impatient get nervous and the calm remain self-
 possessed’. If the world is on fire, will impatience help us to put out the fire? And is it for us to put out the fire? Do you know that firemen do not shoot water at the raging flames when a great fire breaks out? They direct their attention to the parts round the flames. If they can save them, they should be regarded as efficient, that is, as [karma] yogis. If we do our own duty well, we would in effect have put out the fire. It may not seem to the physical eye to have been put out, but you may rest assured that it has been put out. My long search for truth has revealed to me no other way but this, nor is it likely to reveal any other in future. If what I have said is not correct, it would become impossible to follow the path of truth and cling to it scrupulously. We can insist only on that which is possible. If anyone demands air of the mountains on the moon, we would have to call him a Shaikhchallilibtech_714_footnotelibtech_715_footnotefor his desire can never be satisfied. And this is also true about the scope of our duty. Really speaking, everyone’s duty is clear enough for him to see, for one does not have to look far to find it. One has to look no farther than the tip of one’s nose. We have merely to clean the dirt immediately in front of our feet. As we clean it, we shall discover more dirt to be cleaned and will clean that too. It does not matter that, at the end of our lives, there will be as much dirt to be cleaned as when we started. In truth, however, can we say that life ends? The body perishes, but does that matter? And if life does not end, we should not feel disheartened to discover that the dirt has not disappeared. A  tailor’s son goes on stitching all his life. If he falls dead with a yawn, a needle in his hand, he would be a man of true devotion to duty.

   LETTER TO KASTURBA GANDHI  
 August 20, 1932
 You will soon be released now. But you will feel unhappy that you cannot see me. I also feel unhappy. I may feel tempted to relax for your sake at least. But you also will agree that it would not be proper for me to do so. We have become what we are through self- sacrifice. You should, therefore, show patience. Write to me in detail.

   LETTER TO BALKRISHNAlibtech_716_footnote  
 August 20, 1932
 I do not know with certainty what Shankaracharya meant by maya. This is what I believe. The world which we see and believe in is mere appearance; it is a product of our imagination. But in its true essence it does exist. We do not know what that essence is. We say that  it is Brahman, but we characterize all descriptions of the latter as inadequate. The world also a Brahman and not different from it. The difference which we see is mere appearance.
 My view is that the span of our life can be lengthened or shortened. The truth is that every species is born with its natural functioning determined. We do not know and need not know what they are.
 The divisions of time are man-made and they are smaller even than particles of dust in the cosmic cycles of time. Even if crores of units of our time as big as the Himalayas were added together, the total would be smaller than a cosmic cycle of time. It is very little, therefore, which man commands. Let him be pleased with it as much as he will.
 There are innumerable physical causes of dreams. I have expe- rienced that, while dreaming, we can be conscious of its unreality. Such a moment may possibly be the point of transition from the dream state to the waking state. Involuntary discharges are sometimes the result of purely physical causes and take place  even  without impure thoughts in one’s mind. They can be stopped by changes in one’s food. Mostly they are caused by constipation. When such
 
 discharges are due to milk, mostly the immediate cause is impure thoughts, since milk has a tendency to stimulate passion. But that is not the case with you. That is, milk cannot stimulate passion in  persons whose bodies have become weak even if the person is of a passionate nature. All the power of the milk is used up in building the body of such a person. Dr. Rajab Ali’s view is correct within certain limits. But what he says does not apply to persons who are completely healthy in body and mind.
 The desire to work for the welfare of the world is an essential element in the nature of a man of spiritual knowledge. There can be no exception to this.
 I cannot say for what length of time I can keep out all thoughts from my mind, since I have never tried to test this. But I know that I am able to keep out unnecessary thoughts. If any such thoughts come, they have to run away like thieves.
 Hypocrisy is nothing but the mask which falsehood wears. [From Gujarati]

   LETTER TO MATHURADASlibtech_717_footnote  
 August 20, 1932 The plan of voluntary dress-making for yajna is not intended to provide the work of stitching khadi clothes for the poor. The idea
 behind it is to promote quicker sale without incurring loss, of khadi woven by the  poor  and  to  reduce  its  price  which  is  felt  to  be  high libtech_718_footnote
 Do not pay attention to carnal thoughts either. Once we have made up our mind in regard to a thing, we should take it as finally settled. A vow means that the mind stops thinking about the thing concerning which we have taken the vow. When a business man has concluded a deal, he does not think further about it and directs his attention to other things. We should act in the same manner with regard to vows.

CHI. MADALASA,
   LETTER TO MADALASA BAJAJ  
 August 20, 1932
  	I got your letter. You may believe that you are full of envy, pride, 	etc., but I don’t believe so. From whom could you have got these 	defects? Jamnalal certainly does not have them, nor Janakibehn. You 	have also not come under the influence of bad company. And there is 	nothing you lack. Yes, you are inclined to be angry. I, too, 	observed that. But Janakibehn also has that weakness. And, moreover, 	your body is weak. But you are wise. Make a conscious effort, 	therefore, to overcome your shortcoming. Other people also are human 	beings like us. The same atman dwells in all of us. Hence, 	getting angry with anybody means getting angry with ourselves. 	Moreover, no short-comings remain in anyone in whom a passion for 	the service of every living creature has been aroused. You should, 	therefore, cultivate greater devotion to service. It 	will make me happy if you write to me regularly.  Blessings 	from  BAPU [From 	Gujarati]  Panchven 	Putrako Bapuke Ashirvad, 	p. 313

  	I got your letter. Your handwriting has improved greatly. If your 	present weight is due to a strong build, why do you wish to reduce 	it? You will be better equipped for service if you grow up to be big 	and strong in body, provided of course that your mind also becomes 	strong along with the body. If the body has become merely fat 	because of some disease, you should certainly try to reduce your 	weight. Do you suffer from any disease? Write to me from time to 	time.

   READING AND REFLECTION—IIlibtech_720_footnote  
 August 21, 1932
 Awake and arise, O traveller, it is morning now; It is no longer night that you still slumber.libtech_721_footnote
If   anybody  understands   these   lines   to   mean   simply:   “O  
 traveller, arise, it is morning now. Is it night that you are still sleeping?”—then he has read the lines but not reflected over their meaning. For such a reader will rise early at dawn and feel satisfied. But a reader who wishes to think will ask : Who is this traveller? What is meant by “It is morning”? What does the poet mean when he says that it is no longer night? What does sleeping mean? He will then discover daily new meanings in every line, and understand that the traveller represents every human being. For one who has faith in God, it is always morning. Night may also signify ignorance. This line applies to any person who is negligent, be it in ever so small a degree. Anybody who tells a lie also slumbers. The line is a call to such a
 
 the following item.
 
 person to wake up. We may thus read a wide meaning in the line and learn peace of mind through it. In other words, meditation on this single line can supply enough provision to a man for his spiritual journey, whereas a person who has memorized the four Vedas and also studied their meaning may find them a useless burden. I have given here but one illustration which occurred to me. If all of us decide in what direction we wish to progress and start thinking, we would discover new meanings in life and daily experience a new joy.

   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI  
 August 20/21, 1932
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got your heavy mail. There was a bitter letter from Champa. I immediately wrote a postcard in reply, which you should get  on Sunday or Monday. Now that Narmada has been saved, we owe an especial duty to her. I think her education has been poor. Her handwriting is extremely careless. If she has the good fortune now to observe brahmacharya for the rest of her life, I think she will have to know things. See, therefore, if you can give her more help (by way of time) and educate her. If she does not work with sincere enthusiasm to make good use of the time which you give to her, you may stop the help. About Liladhar, what you have done seems all right. If you can, try and make Jaisukhlal’s daughters forget Amreli. What is the name of Indu’s maternal uncle? What is his occupation in Palitana? Kusum cannot take up nursing as long as she is not completely free from the danger of tuberculosis. It would be very bad if she joins and returns in a month or so. She ought to realize that nursing is a very strenuous work. A sincere nurse has to be on her feet the whole day. She can hardly find time even for a hurried meal.
 Ratubhai’s condition is pitiable. Why does he let his children remain in college when he is in debt? I can easily see that he will not be able to go to Rangoon. Will not any of his children be ready to come and stay in the Ashram? A boy who is truthful, industrious and healthy can rise as high as he wishes in the Ashram. May be he will not get there the education which he gets in a college. But, after all what is the value of that education?
 You are doing a very good thing in keeping Ratilal from going.  I had fine letters from Chhaganlal, so that I am now relatively free
 from worry from that source. I got letters from Nanalal and Manilal, too. Manjula has been writing regularly. She is rising higher in my esteem every day.
 I have been having novel experiences in regard to my food. Eating bananas did not cure my constipation completely as long as I was drinking milk. I, therefore, stopped milk and ate bananas only for some days. For the evening meal I had bread and vegetable. This relieved the constipation to some degree. But, being eager to eat the same food as ‘C’ class prisoners do, and remembering that in 1930  I had tried rotlas of bajri and that had cured my constipation, for the
 last three days I have been eating in the evening one rotlo with vegetable. That has cured the constipation completely. But on the last occasion the continued consumption of bajri had resulted in more than the disappearance of constipation, and so I had to give it up. It is possible that the same thing may happen this time. I have not decided to exclude milk completely for the present. I, therefore, intend to take  it with bajri as soon as I am free from the fear of constipation. I have given all these details so that, if anybody there wishes to make the same experiment for constipation, he may do so. But the essential condition for the success of this experiment is that there should be no oil or ghee in the vegetable, nor should any ghee or milk be taken with the bajri cake. In 1930, when my constipation was cured, I ate only bajri and vegetables. I did not eat fruit, nor almonds. I had added the latter after the constipation was relieved. But I did consume sour lemons. The vegetables should include some greens.
 If the doctor advises, Parasram should be got operated upon.  You are doing right in permitting Premabehn to  go  out  fre-
quently. She will take time to become steady. I do write to her letters
to calm her.
 I also can understand about the wire from Darjeeling. You have done quite right in taking no action on it. You should give a few details of the wire to Mahavir and ask him what the purpose behind sending that wire was. You should also write to Agamgiri and ask him the same question.
 If anybody asks for permission to publish a German translation of Vratavicharlibtech_722_footnotelibtech_723_footnote, you may tell him that we claim copyright for none of
 
 
 our publications and that, therefore, he can translate it, but also tell him that it is essential for such a book that a translator should not depart from the original in any point.
 When you say that Shankarbhai’s arm will require treatment for a long time, I hope you don’t mean that some defect is likely to remain.
 Or, is some other complication feared? Is the arm being examined by anybody from time to time?

   LETTER TO RAMESHWARDAS PODDAR  
 August 21, 1932
 CHI. RAMESHWARDAS,
 I feel no pain while writing. I of course dictate to Mahadev when the letter is long. I do not remember your vows. If you also do not remember them, then forget about them and think as if you had taken none. Your mode of life is still not such that it can endure vows. But you should make resolutions slowly one after another. If you remember the vows and are observing them, please let me know what they are. Even if you do nothing else, keep repeating Ramanama. Some day you will suddenly see light in the midst of darkness.

  	Your inquiry about the Koran is pertinent. I do not believe any 	gospel to be a message from God delivered to someone by the angels 	but I do believe it to be the promptings of the inner voice of the 	prophets. This much should suffice for us. It is good that you are 	planning to understand well the text of the Koran. The very purpose 	of the study of scriptures is to comprehend fully the text and its 	impact upon our heart.  	How is it that Kudsia knows no Urdu? Do all the members of your 	family know English only? Give me the history of your caln, where it 	originally belonged to, when and how the interest in Urdu was lost? 	I suppose you are all right now. Do not overwork  or take anything 	to heart. Be cheerful and be satisfied with What God permitsyou to 	do. You must have forwarded the letter to Dr. Sharma. Tell me if you 	can read my letter with ease. I would prefer to write in Urdu if 	that pleases you. Every week you must point out my mistakes. But 	tell me unhesitatingly if you like my English letters better. I want 	you to be happy. It is better that you write to me in Urdu but in 	that case you will have to write legibly, otherwise I shall be 	unable to read the letter.

  	The word for ‘learned’ in the shloka you have quoted 	includes the meaning ‘virtuous’. In the olden times the word for 	a learned 
 man, viz., vidvan was synonymous with vedavid, meaning ‘  the knower of the Vedas’, and it was believed that anyone who knew the Vedas was bound to be virtuous. What I meant to say was that Doctor was respected because of his virtue. This does not mean that scholarship may never be honoured. But we know very well that there are many highly learned people who are utterly ignored.

         CHI. 	MANILAL,    LETTER TO MANILAL GANDHI    August 	22,1932 
  	I have your letter. I am more than happy that both of you are free 	from fever. I hope that you have fully regained your normal health. 	I was pained to read what you say about Pragji. I had a letter from 	Mr. Ritch, in which he expresses his view that Phoenix ought not to 	be disbanded. He writes nothing about Pragji, but he has some 	complaint against you, He says that you have got involved  with  	Sorabji and have lost some money. I hope that this is not true. What 	you have belongs to the Trust. Surely you know that you cannot take 	anything from it except what you need to meetyour normal expenses. 	You can neither advance a loan or make a gift from it, nor can 	borrow money against it. I think that the plot of twenty-five bighas 	also was leased out to meet the needs of Indian Opinion. 	Even that was a mistake, however. Since you yourself realized it, I 	need not say anything about it.  	If you are sure that Pragji has been concerned only with his own 	interest, then I think that you ought not to use his services for 	Indian Opinion. I will write to him if you wish that I should 	do so.  	All three of us are well. Devadas has recovered.He will take rest 	for some time. Pyarelal has been released. Manibehn is again in jail 	for one year and three months. Ramdas is all right. Ba is about to 	be released. She has lost some weight.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.

   LETTER TO SUSHILABEHN GANDHI  
 
     CHI. 	SUSHILA,  August 	22,1932 
  	Though your letter of two pages seemed long to you, a lazy woman, I 	found it much too short. Do you know that, whenever I wrote to my 	brother from England, I used to fill 20 to 25 pages and still I 	thought the letter was too short? I did not feel, either, that 	Brother would find it too long and that it would be a bother to him 	to read it. I was sure that he would like a long letter. I would 	write about everything I might have done during the week, everyone I 	might have met and everything I might have read and every 	foolishness I might have committed. No wonder the letter would be so 	many pages long. Moreover, I used to write only to my brother, and 	so I would unburden myself completely in the letter.  	But you are a princess who would, if she could, write only one line 	but writes 50 lines with the words written wide apart form one 	another, and thinks that she has written quite a long letter. All 	right. Please yourself and rule Manilal. You were married to him 	because he is a rather simple man and you are deep. I always believe 	that your judgement about people would be correct. Exercise a little 	more control over him. Don’t think that, because he is your 	husband, you have done your duty when you have advised or warned 	him. A good wife should hold the husband back by the ear and save 	him from falling into a pit. I believe that you have that strength. 	There is an agreement between Manilal and me that he should not look 	upon you as his servant but should regard you as his life-companion, 	his partner in the duties of life and his better-half. You two, 	therefore, have equal rights over each other. Since you are gifted 	with greater intuition, you have, to that extent, greater authority 	over him than he over you in matters which require it. He knows more 	about the press and,  therefore, he has greater authority in that 	field. similarly, he knows more about water-treatment, and so he may 	have greater authority in that field too. When you read my letter to 	Manilal, you will understand what all this means. How is your ear? 	Does Tara write to you?  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 4792

     BHAI 	KHAMBHATTA,  August 	22, 1932 
  	I have your letter. Do send your ointment, I will try it. But I 	Should tell you that I have tried iodine for a long  time.  If  the 	ointment contains some other useful ingredients, it may be worth 	trying. What a poor memory I have that I forgot that we had Vidya 	treated by you. It is true that one should not have any illness even 	in old age. But that can be expected only of a person who has 	refrained from bodily pleasures throughout his life. But I have 	indulged in plenty of them. Only one was left, namely that I never 	had my hands massaged before going to bed. That is why I remember 	you every day at night.

Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: C.W. 9436      LETTER TO RAIHANA TYABJI    August 	22,1932  DEAR 	DAUGHTER RAIHANA,  	I got your letter, and also Father’s today. I had received your 	letter in which you had copied Dagh’s ghazal, but after 	considerable 
 delay. I have an impression that I had written to you about having received one of your letters. I liked that ghazal. I have all your letters with me. Why did you trouble Mother about Ghalib’s ghazal? I do not wish to give so much trouble to you either. Whatever you can give without much trouble to yourself will be enough for me. I have now got quite a few Urdu books. It is good that Purohitji has been released. Why did Bhaiji have to drop the idea of going to Afghanistan? Mahadev is learning French and Urdu. Father used to teach him French. Since then he has not given it up. He will think about learning the language of Timbuctoo after having learnt these two. But, then, you will have to teach it to him, because you are likely to be the only one in our world who knows that language. I am not writing separately to Father. There is danger in writing to elders. Give my regards to Father and Mother, and vandemataram to the others. To you a slap.

         CHI. 	MIRA,    LETTER TO MIRABEHN      August 	23, 1932 
  	I wrote one letterlibtech_727_footnotelibtech_728_footnoteor rather postcard at your new address.  	I had made up my mind not to chide you even mentally if you fell ill 	again. I said to myself when I heard of your illness from Kashi that 	it would not do to be finding fault with you every time you got ill. 	No doubt we get ill through our faults. But the difficulty lies in 	our inability always to know our errors before hand. The other is 	our inability always to guard against them even when we know them. 	It is therefore enough to know these truths that we ail through our 	own mistakes and then not always to be chiding ourselves when we do 	get ill. Your latest lapse therefore does not surprise me. It was 	inevitable in     
 the circumstances related by you. God be thanked that you are able to tide over these illnesses without their leaving bad after-effects. The elimination (of) disease germs through natural treatment often leaves the system purer and stronger. the rest you are getting is providential. And you are not going to bother if you get no permission to receive visitors or even to write letters. Only 50 years ago prisoners could not receive visitors or write letters. Ordinary prison life nowadays has lost all its terrors. It was a great movement Howardlibtech_729_footnoteset on foot. It is only in its beginning stages. The day is not far distant when prisons will be rechristened and persons will be merely detained so as to be unable to do harm whether moral, social or political in accordance with the conception of the respective States. But we have to rejoice whatever the conditions of jail life, trying nevertheless to secure relief wherever possible.
 Now about my food. Do you not remember that here in Yeravda  I could not get rid of constipation with milk and juicy fruit and that I was able to do so only by dropping milk? This time, too, I had dropped milk only because I could not keep myself fit on milk and fruit. This time I began banana with milk. There was slight improvement. But that was not enough. I have therefore just for a few days dropped milk and am taking bajri chapati instead of wheat and the effect has been marvellous. During last incarcerationlibtech_730_footnotelibtech_731_footnoteit was  bajri that removed my constipation. And I was able to pass the rest of the term on bread, vegetables and almond cream. I propose to go back to milk and see whether with bajri I am able to avoid constipation. I am keeping excellent health. And as you can see I am writing with the right hand without coming to grief. For the better protection of the left elbow, I have gone back to the Magan charkha and am this time able to draw over 30 counts. I am satisfied with this. The output per hour is still bad. It hardly reaches 100 rounds per hour.
 Vallabhbhai is making very rapid progress with his Sanskrit. Mahadev is doing both French and Urdu. So our time is being very usefully spent. The weather has suddenly turned bright and very hot here—unusual at this time of the year. I hope it is not bad with you.
 I hope you have the mosquito-net. Love from us all.

   LETTER TO DARBARI SADHUlibtech_733_footnote  
 
 August 23, 1932 It does not seem correct to me to say that it is part of man’s nature to spend some time in idle thoughts. if there is a single
 exception to this, we cannot say that it is part of man’s nature to do so. Actually, we find many exceptions. It is true that vast numbers of people are always busy thinking about all manner of things which they will do or will not do, and thus may be said to spend time in idle thoughts. If thiswere not so, it would not be necessary to emphasize the importance of concentration. What is important for us atpresent is this. We ourselves make all kinds of plans and resolutions, most of which we do not even remember aftersome time. All such thoughts are mental incontinence. Just as man dissipates his physical strength through ordinary incontinence, so he dissipates his mental strength through mental incontinence, and, as physical weakness affects the mind, so mental weakness affects the body. That is why I have defined brahmacharya in a wide sense and described even idle thoughts as violation of it. By defining brahmacharya in a narrow sense, we have made it more difficult to observe. if we accept its wider definition and try to control all the eleven organslibtech_734_footnotelibtech_735_footnote, the control   of  the  one  most important organwould be much easier. You seem to believe in the heart of your hearts that physical activity prevents or hinders us from watching the progress of our inward purfication. My experience is the opposite of this. Without inward purification, work cannot be done in a spirit of non-attachment. Hence the degree of inward purification can be judged mainly by the purity of our work. Anybody who tries to cultivate inward purity without doing work will more likely that not be in danger of falling into a delusion. I have seen many such instances. I will give an ordinary example. I have known many co- workers making all kinds of good resolutions in jail, and also seen
 
 their resolutions broken at the first blow after they were released. In jail they were quite sure that they would never swerve from their resolutions, that they had achieved inward purification, that they had examined themselves in complete peace ofmind and that they had acquired concentration in prayer. ButI found that the moment they were outside the jail walls all this evaporated into thin air. The fifth verse ofChapter III of the Gita states a profound truth. Scientist after scientist has told us that the principle enunciated in it is a universal law. It simply means that no human being can cease from karma even for a moment. Karma or motion is the universal law of all material things and forms of life. Man’s spiritual knowledge  and  his excellence lie in obeying it in a spirit of non-attachment. There are two verses in the Ishopanishadlibtech_736_footnotelibtech_737_footnotewhich state the same truth, and they are equally profound. Who am I to criticize a great soul like the Buddha? Besides, I love and revere him. But did he himself set up the organization [ of monasteries] or did his followers do so? whoever did it, the monasteries which were established became, in obedience to this universal law, stagnant and by and by acquired reputation as dens of sloth. Even today we find Buddhist monks in Ceylon, Burma and Tibet sunk in ignorance and the veritable images of sloth. In India, too, the monks known assannyasis are not found to be shiningspecimens of humanity.
 Personally I am convinced, therefore, that man can achieve real and enduring purfication of heart only through work. I again feel tempted to quote the Gita. Verse 18 of Chapter IV means that he who sees action in inaction and inaction in action is the wise man, he is the true yogi and the true man of karma. I have, however, explained here what I have found in my own experience. I have quoted the Gita verses because I have found the truth of their teaching in my experience. I never quote anything from Shastras which I have not tested in experience. The experience of others may be different from mine and they may even quote verses from the Gita which tend in the opposite direction or they may quote in support of their experience the same verses which I do and interpret them differently. All this is possible. I, therefore, never insist that all people should accept my experience as the sole guide.

 Mathuradas has not written to me again. But Shri Gangadharrao Deshpande received a letter from him. He says that Mathuradas is keeping good health. He has got good companions. As for the climate at Belgaum, it suited Mathuradas in the past. It is good that he has been patient and postponed going there right now. He may go there for a time after the rains stop.
All of us are keeping good health.

   LETTER TO NIRMALA B. MASHRUWALA  
 
 
     CHI. 	NIRMALA,  August 	24, 1932 
  	I got your letter. I have been getting proofs of Gitamanthan. 	I have got the proofs of Chapters X to XIII, but the proofs of the 	last are not complete. Why have the proofs of the earlier chapters 	been not sent to me? When were these chapters written and who reads 	the proofs? When is the book expected to be published? who keeps 	Gomatilibtech_747_footnotecompany? 	How does she spend the day? And now the reply to Kishorelal’s 	letter. I have not yet been able to take up Gandhi Vichar Dohanlibtech_748_footnotelibtech_749_footnote. Just now my correspondence is rather heavy, and 	it has become very much more so after Dr. Mehta’s death. I have to 	write many letters to give what advice I can from here and get the 	necessary information for the purpose, and that leaves very little 	time for other things. I do not wish to overstrain myself or cut 	down on sleep to do anything. I do not even sacrifice for any work 	the short midday nap which I need. I can, therefore, read only 	during the time which is left after attending to other necessary 	things. During that time I read a little from the Upanishads and go 	through  books on astronomy. This week I have not been able to read 	any Urdu book, though till now I could give some time at least for 	its study every day. The historylibtech_750_footnotelibtech_751_footnoteof 	the Ashram is almost complete, but I have had to keep it aside for 	some time. If the predictions of the astrologers come true, all my 	plans would be in a mess. But the planets betray them time and 	again, and, therefore, as we all go on working without thinking of 	death, I go on working unmindful of their predictions. In fact all 	three of us go on working. Nobody has sent me the book on health as 	yet.      
 If I get it, I would go through it at the earliest opportunity. There is every likelihood of my making some changes in it. Experiments for improving spinning are going on very well. Mahadev spins yarn of 80 counts and Sardar has reached 40 counts. He will reach a still higher figure. The two spin on the Gandiva spinning-wheel and I spin on the Magan spinning-wheel. I can spin yarn of 30 counts on it, and hope to reach 40 counts. Sardar’s study of Sanskrit is progressing with the speed of a race horse. He is studying at present part VI of Satavlekar’s pathamala. In addition to that, he studies five verses from the Gita every day. He gives plenty of time to this study. It is indeed very good that you are learning Kannada. It is of course true that, if the script were the same, a good deal of time would be saved. But we will see about that when we have Ramarajya. It is my experience, however, that after we have learnt two or three scripts, more scripts give no trouble, for we discover points of similarity in all of them. I have read all the proofs of Gitamanthan which I have received. I liked the language. He has almost written a new Gita on the basis of the orginal.  I have not yielded to the temptation of making changes in the book, for I feel that it would be improper to do so. I have thought it better to leave as it is the arrangement which kishorelal has adopted  after careful thinking. There is no change in the condition of my  left elbow. It gives me no trouble. All three of us are very well.

That can be done only on the basis 	 of the   facts set out by you, those which I have gathered in 	conversations from you and those which are revealed in the letters. 	The task is going     
 to be more difficult than I had thought. But I will try to do justice to it. At present I am in no mood to take up such work. That is certainly an obstacle in my path. Ultimately, God will let me do only what He has willed.

  	I got your letter. It is of course the ideal thing to follow the 	rules applicable to the lowest class. But although following the 	rules applicable to ‘C’ class prisoners, we should try to 	secure, if we can, whatever food is necessary for our health. Many 	‘C’class prisoners get milk, etc. This need not cause any 	surprise. If we can secure such food without sacrificing  our  	self-respect,  it  should  be welcome; but if we do not get it, we 	should do without it and not  feel unhappy. The regular practice of 	writing a daily diary, even in the fewest possible words, cures many 	undesirable habits in us. For a person who wishes to live 	truthfully, a daily diary serves as a sentinel. Now that you have 	decided to keep such a diary, cling to    
 your resolution. I hope no effect of the injury which you had received on the head is left now.
 It was expected that the creation of classes [of political prisoners] would give rise to jealousies. The only thing we can do is to remain unaffected by them and to forgo as far as possible the  privileges accorded to the higher classes.
 What is wrong with Nanabhai’s health? Manilal and Sushila wrote to me also. Manilal is in some trouble. He says that he did not get on well with Pragji. Perhaps people know about this there.
 Nirmala writes to me occasionally and gives news about Kishorelal and Gomati.
Please write to me from time to time

 August 25, 1932
 CHI. TARAMATI,
 I have your letter and that of Dilip. I replied to your previous letter yesterday. You must have received it. Hinkalam means the Belgaum jail, just as Yeravda means the Poona jail. Mathuradas has not been transferred. I too saw it in the newspapers. Explain thoroughly to Dilip the meaning of the verse in Chapter II of the Gita. He should not merely cram it. I am not writing separately to him today.

  	It was a good thing that you sent me Vinoba’s interpretation of 	those verses. We have no ground for believing that that was the  	author’s meaning. But as I have explained in the preface to    
 Anasaktiyoga , the utterances of poets go on acquiring ever new and revolutionary meanings, and that is as it should be. Vinoba has every right to interpret the verses as he has done. If, however, you are not satisfied with his interpretation, think over the meaning which I have given.libtech_761_footnoteIf even that does not satisfy you, you may give the verses any meaning which appeals to your reason provided it is not contrary to the chief aim of the Gita. And if you cannot do even that, you should leave the verses as ones which you cannot understand just now. If they do not yield a satisfactory meaning, that will not hinder your study of the Gita. Your daily programme of work is good. But there is no provision for rest in it. You should frame a programme which will help you to get over your headaches. For that, you should stop all work, except what you do as yajna, and take rest. You should lie down and put a mud-pack on your head. If you do this for one week, your headaches are bound to disappear. Also the pills given by  Dr. Talwalkar will produce their effect. Headache is not a disease by itself, but is a symptom of some other disease or a warning that something is coming . If you take rest for a few days now, it will save you from a long rest afterwards. Reduce your reading. You have provided the time from 5.45 a. m. to 6.30 a.m., 9.15 a.m. to 10.30 a.m., and 11.45
 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. for study of the Gita and reading of newspapers. You may stop both for the time being and take rest at that time. If that does not give you relief, reduce carpentry work a little. You should regard it as your moral duty to banish this disease and should try to do so by every possible means.

   LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK  
 
 
     CHI. 	PREMA,  August 	26, 1932 
  	I got your letter. I hope you do not exhibit different virtues from 	time to time in order to win from me the praise which they deserve. 	If you do that my praise will lose all its valuelibtech_763_footnote.  	You will not see anywhere else the fierce hatreds which you see in 	Kathiawar. I am not, therefore, surprised that you saw an exhibition 	of them too. Such exhibitions take place there without any prepara- 	tion. A person like . . . is likely to get frozen by an exhibition 	of such hatreds, but it is strange that though         lives in 	Rajkot she could not  	remove . . . ’s depression. I am sure she must have tied on his 	wrist the customary raksha on the Balev Day. But were they 	satisfied with a raksha of hand- spun yarn?  It ought 	not to be beyond      ’s strength  	to discover the cause of. .’s unhappiness and remove it       used 	to  	adore his wife,       My belief is that, though married, they 	observed  brahmacharya. . .’s  passing away was a great shock to.     	  Perhaps  	deep down in his heart       wishes to marry. He cannot understand 	his  	own  condition. But.     should have as wife a girl with the same 	ideals  	as his own. Failing to get such a wife, if he gets a sister with 	strong idealism in her character, . . . may perhaps blossom out. I 	have supposed.      to be a perfect brahmacharini. She 	cherishes friendship  	for. . . , and has idealism in her character. Since you wrote about. 	   ’s     
 depression, I have been tempted to write this. If you think that I have understood . . .’s character correctly and that what I have suggested is not beyond her strength, you may safely send this letter to her. If you feel that this is beyond her strength or that it is not her work, you may ignore this part of the letter. . . . craves for pure love. But. . . is full of likes and dislikes. he can love very few persons and  so remains discontented within himself all the time. Such a person feels little need for a wife. But [,if married,] he can remain absorbed in his wife. He must get the sisterly love of a woman who is free from passion. If . . . gets such a sister, his life will take a new turn.
 Women in our society do not try to cultivate this virtue. They know how to be good wives, but do not know how to be good sisters. In order to be a good sister, one requires great capacity for renunciation. It seems self-evident to me that a wife can never be a perfect sister. A woman can be a true sister to the whole world. A wife can surrender herself only to one person. The capacity to be a good wife is a useful virtue, but it does not have to be cultivated, for a wife’s relation to her husband permits the satisfaction of physical desire. It is extremely difficult to cultivate the virtue required in  one  who would be a sister to the whole world. Only a woman for whom brahmacharya is a natural state and in whom the spirit of service has become the strongest impulse of her life can become that has not
 given me the impression that she has risen so far, but I certainly believe that she has the capacity to rise so high. Maybe you have been instrumental in creating this impression in me. I have now said everything which I felt about this matter. I have indeed been striving to make you such a sister. It is a difficult task. Let the result be as God wills it.
 You have given a good description of the exhibition. Your descriptions are always interesting to read and make one think.
 You did right in returning to the Ashram for the Janmashtami festival. See that you overcome your anger. Do you know that Dhiru was simply not ready to go with you? Don’t get angry with him at any time. He is a child; you are not. If you win over Dhiru, it will be your victory; if you fail to do so, it will be your defeat.
 Is there any test by which to judge whether a father  and  a mother are cultured? Who can say what the parents’ state of mind was at the time of conception? I think, therefore, that it is best to cling to the rule that what is good bears good fruit. If we cannot prove the
 truth of this rule in every individual case, the reason may be our ignorance and not the inadequacy of the rule.
Even if I didlibtech_764_footnotelibtech_765_footnotebelieve in Fate, its decrees could not be altered.
Fate means the effect of past karma.
 For saving the prostitutes from their profession, it is necessary that men should cease to be beasts. As long as we have beast-like men in the world, so long shall we have prostitutes. If any prostitutes give up their profession and turn a new leaf in their lives, the so- called “respectable” men will certainly come forward to marry them. It is not true that once a prostitute, always a prostitute.
 The belief that in every country girls are abducted for the army seems exaggerated to me. In a well-governed country this cannot happen.
 It is not correct to believe that residents of the Malabar coast can digest coconut even after they have left the air of that place. By mixing coconut with tandalja, you weakened the effect of tandalja. I have often included coconut in my diet. It didn’t agree with me. But it is highly probable that it is essential with other articles of food in regions where it grows.

I would advise you to draw up a regular plan of study in jail and 	master the subjects in which you are weak at present.

         CHI. 	KAKA,    LETTER TO D.B. KALELKAR    August 	26/27, 1932 
  	After a long time and through Col. Doyle’s kindness I got a letter 	from you, dated 1 [6-8-1932]libtech_773_footnotelibtech_774_footnote. 	The Colonel also told me today that you must have reached Ahmedabad 	today, and added that you should give up spinning, too, for some 	time in order to get rid of the pain in your back. I promised to 	convey this to you and to advise you to give up spinning as long as 	the pain persists. You should, therefore, give up spinning for some 	time. If you can spin on the takli standing and without 	getting tired, as you used to do here, you may do so, but you need 	not do even that. The only thing which I insist on your doing just 	now is to improve your health and get strong. Do get the area on the 	back where you feel the pain in the bone gently massaged. It is very 	good indeed that you can bathe with cold water. (Please let me know 	who are the other people with you there) . . . libtech_775_footnote  	I am writing to Hiralal about the book on astronomy. He has already 	sent me three of the books in your list. They are as follows: 	Stellar Maps, Khagolchitram and Hindu 	Astronomy. I am sending them with this. There is some 	history behind Khagolchitram. It was torn when it arrived 	here. libtech_776_footnoteI 	shall soon be having a fairly good       
 collection of books on astronomy. There are three books by Jeans which are worth reading. If you have not read them, would you like me to send any of them? Hiralal has sent me Maeterlink’s book at your suggestion. I got it only two or three days ago. Since it was sent at your suggestion, you must have read it of course. If you want it, however, please let me know and I will send it too. I can easily recognize the morning constellations whose names you have given. You used to tell me names of many constellations but at that time they were only names to me. Now I can recognize most of them. I am able to read something at least every day. I have glanced through the chapters you have written. Though I have not read them carefully, I observed one deficiency in them. I felt, after reading a short sketch of Sir William Hershel’s life in Ball’s Story of the Sky, that you should give the names and short lives of Western astronomers, some of whom, as you yourself say, were men of great courage and spirit and of noble character. A modest effort to do this was made in Jyotirvilas. The book on astronomy which we wish to publish should be as perfect as possible and should give an account of all discoveries to date in the field. After reading the books of Jeans, I also feel that the  book should give some knowledge about physics. This means that the scope of your undertaking becomes a little wider. I have merely thrown out a suggestion here. I don’t expect you to do all this while you are resting there. Perhaps it is beyond your capacity, and so I do not wish to analyse your chapters too critically. Moreover, the book should not be such as only highly educated persons can understand. It should be written with villagers in view. But you should attach more importance to your health than to even this undertaking. You should go on with the work only if you can improve your health at the same time and not at its cost.
 How is it possible that I would not know Pundaliklibtech_777_footnote?  I  don’t think he is likely to have accompanied you there. The disease from which he is suffering is an awful one. I have no other remedy to suggest for it except fasting, cold hip-baths and enemas. The lower intestines will recover their normal position only if they are given complete rest. Pundalik’s complaint is known as prolapsus of the rectum. The effect of enema will be that the faeces will be expelled by
 
 the force of the water without the rectum slipping out. And since he will be fasting, the intestines will have no work to do and the rectum will not then slip out.
 I think you will get this letter without  much  delay. Vallabhbhai’s study of Sanskrit is progressing with the speed of Indra’s horse. As soon as spinning is over, he picks up a book of Sanskrit. He has completed six parts of Satavlekar’s series and two chapters of the Gita. He does five verses every day. He becomes equally absorbed in spinning. He has reached as far as 40 counts. I don’t think any student of the Vidyapith can equal his capacity for hard work. Mahadev’s study of French and Urdu is progressing. He has reached as far as 80 counts. I had gone as far as 53 counts on the Gandiva spinning-wheel, but I have gone back to the Magan spinning- wheel to prevent harm to the left elbow. I have not been able to rise above 30 counts on it. In addition to astronomy, I also study Urdu a little. Correspondence takes up a great deal of time. After Dr. Mehta’s death, I have had to write numerous letters concerning the affairs of his family. I suppose you have heard about his death. He had got a cut in a foot with a piece of glass and the wound became septic. The leg had to be amputated. The operation was successful, but afterwards he developed double pneumonia which proved fatal. This is the fourth week since he died.
 Maganlal (Dr. Mehta’s) must have landed in Bombay today. He had gone to England.	libtech_778_footnote

If we can now spin fine yarn, the spinning-wheels, spindles and 	slivers are much more responsible for success than our own effort. 	Now that all of us are trying to spin yarn of fine count, there 	should be no slivers of inferior quality in the Ashram. Does every 	spinner use           
 slivers made by himself, or do the slivers get mixed up? I think if everyone would spin with his own slivers, the quality of carding would improve very much. If we make fine yarn as defined by us the centre round which everything else should revolve, every process from the sowing of cotton seeds to the weaving of the cloth is  bound  to become perfect. We shall then have to evolve the best quality seeds, improve the soil, look to the quality of the manure, pay careful attention to the manner of separating the cotton from the pods, and so on. Fine yarn means yarn uniformly of not less than 40 counts, which would stand comparison with good mill yarn of the same count and from which a weaver can weave cloth with ease. I chose the figure of 40 in this definition because it is possible to spin yarn of lower count than that with some effort form slivers of inferior quality, but not yarn of 40 counts. please let me know what inconvenience you think one feels in the posture in which one has to sit for spinning on the Gandiva spinning-wheel. According to me, one of the many excellences of this wheel is that you can spin on it while sitting in any position. One can sit on a chair or a stool, put the spinning-wheel on a box or a bench and spin. You can keep it to your left or right, or even in front. When travelling in a train, I put it on the same berth on which I sit and spin. There will be no harm if Chhakkaddas’s, slivers arrive after some time. If you have not sent Keshu’s slivers before you send Chhakkaddas’s, you may send the two together with a sign to identify Keshu’s. What is the count of the yarn which Abbas spins? Please let me know the length and circumference of his spindle. You need not worry if you cannot spin yarn of more than 20-22 counts. I would be satisfied with the quality of yarn that you can spin with the best slivers and the thinnest spindle.
 I did not receive the Anantapur report even during this week. Who has signed the receipt which you have got? You may tell  parasram what you consider necessary. Why did Pyarelal leave in such haste? Padma must send details of miscellaneous expenses. Read the letterlibtech_790_footnotelibtech_791_footnotewhich I have written to her. What you have written to Mahavir’s uncle is quite correct. I was glad to leran that Jivanlal’s brother’s wife had come there . Has she had any education?
 Your question about the Dattatreya temple is good. I don’t look upon the shrine as a temple. I think that it is a form of a
 
 samadhilibtech_792_footnote.  In any case,  it cannot be used as a public temple. I am also not inclined to make it a private temple, though it seems to me that, if somebody goes and worships at the shrine, he cannot be forbidden. Please find out and let me know what panditji believes and what he desires that we should do. Has any issue been raised about this matter just now?
 Who wrote to you and suggested that some amount should be kept with Trivedilibtech_793_footnotelibtech_794_footnote? There are now very few women left in the jail here. Trivedi would not like our keeping any such amount with him. If , however, you think it necessary, you may do that with his consent. I don’t see any necessity of it. If at any time we specially require something, we can write to the Ashram, and, if we require it urgently, I would feel no hesitation even in obtaining it from Trivedi. Probably Ramabehn, Vasumati and others are there now. Know their views also.
 Read my letter to Liladhar. Do only what you think right. Whose idea was the exhibition at Rajkot? Was the entire burden on Jamnadas?

 If the discharge from Manjula’s ear persists, consult Dr. Talwalkar and try the remedy which he advises. Ask Agam Giri a straight question, whether he is dissatisfied in any way with the Giri family, or whether he has any suggestion to make. Does Mahavir write to you regularly? To me he does not. When he had complaints to make, he wrote frequently enough.

 Kaka has been transferred to the prison there. Apply for permission to see him. I have written to Ba directly this time. I don’t believe that she can have lost 16 pounds of weights. If she lost so much weight, she would become a mere skeleton. Have you seen her? Make a more careful inquiry. How much milk does she consume? What other food does she eat?
 Send to the Superintendent by registered post the postal acknowledgement for the registration of the Anantapur report. Keep with you a copy of the acknowledgement. When you send it, inform me too. I have still not got these papers.
 
 See my letter to Indu. There seems to be some estrangement between him on the one hand and Kanu, Mangala and Nirmala on the other. Please inquire what the matter is. Indu has become eager to learn English. Personally, I think it would be wise to let him occupy his mind in learning English if he studies nothing else.
 I got your letter of the 25th posted separately. When you say four heads of cattle, do you mean cows or bullocks? What was the loss? What were the injections, and for what were they given? You did right in asking Narayanappa to leave. We have endured much from him. It seems that Bhagwanji was right in his judgment. But I don’t believe that we made a mistake in trusting Narayanappa. A person in a responsible position ought not to disqualify anybody on someone’s word, unless he is himself convinced. Our policy had this good result, that Narayanappa has now disqualified himself.
 I hope Kusum is not nervous in the slightest degree. There is no reason at all to become nervous.
 The ceremonial reading of holy works on the Janmashtami day was very well done. What is the number in the Ashram just now? How many are women, and how many men? How many are boys and girls under sixteen? And how many labourers?
 August 28, 1932 Read Nimu’s letter and persuade her to start eating ghee. Ramdas’s  argument  is  correct.  There  has   been  no  change  in  my
food—bajri,  bananas, almonds, oranges and green vegetables. Consti-
 pation has disappeared completely. In other respects also the health is good. Even then, I will certainly start taking milk and see the effect. I want to find out whether bajri helps in preventing constipation in spite of my taking milk. I also see that green vegetables play a big part in helping complete evacuation.
 Take the necessary steps immediately to see that the slivers made are of the finest quality. You need not worry if there is decrease in the quantity of slivers for some time, but pay your attention to ensuring that the work is neat and careful and the slivers are of the best quality, and that there is minimum waste.
There are 54 letters in all.

   ACTION—THOUGHTFUL AND THOUGHTLESSlibtech_795_footnote  
 August 28, 1932 I wrote about reading and reflection.libtech_796_footnotelibtech_797_footnoteToday I wish to say some-  thing about working and thinking. According to me, real education
consists in learning the art of thinking. If we can master it, everything
else will follow in beautiful order.
 The woman in the story who, on seeing the face of  the  mongoose red with blood threw her pot of water at it, acted thought lessly, and repented afterwards for killing the creature which  had saved the life of her son. She could not wipe the stain of this act from her mind for the whole of her life. The loss of the pot and the water are not even worth mentioning, so big was her crime.
 This is an extreme illustration, but it serves to drive home the idea we are discussing. If we do all our work in the Ashram after careful thought, there would be more peace, our efficiency would increase much time would be saved and we would find new interest in our work every day. We employ cattle for working the water-mill and the animal labours the whole day, but its knowledge does not increase and it feels no interest in its work. If there was none to goad it, the animal would not go round. But we are human beings. The [Gujarati] word  manaslibtech_798_footnotecomes from  manushyalibtech_799_footnote, and the latter means, literally, one who thinks, who knows. We ought not to live or act like animals.
 We clean lavatories. If we don’t think about it, we would feel the work to be low and degrading and eagerly wish that we could be saved from it. If , however, we think about it, we would realize that it was our moral duty to do it. To clean it means to make the place perfectly clean, to bury the contents of the bucket carefully, to keep in a clean condition the things with which we do the work, and to  examine the contents. I there is any blood or the  stink  is  very offensive or if there are worms, we may conclude that somebody is ill. We should then find out who that person is. We would of course know who uses a lavatory. If, while cleaning it we discover that the stool is not properly covered with dust or a portion has fallen outside
 
 the proceding item.
 the bucket or thatthe urine has fallen outside it we should find out the guilty person and explain the matter politely to him. All this will be done only by a person who does the work in a spirit of service. This means that as we think daily more careully about our work,it will be done better and more easily every day and cease to be boring and become intersting. I have not here examined the question of cleaning lavatories from every possible point of view. I have merely mentioned it by way of illustration.
 Let us take another example, spinning for yajna. If we do this work with careful thought, we would enjoy it, too, immensely and there would be indefinite progress in the art of spinning. If everybody spun with careful thought, we would make many discoveries and spin yarn of the finest quality.
 And the same is true about prayer. What is prayer? Why do we pray? Why do we observe silence? Why do we use prayers in Sanskrit, and not in Gujarati, Marathi or Hindi? We can think about these and many other questions and make our prayer a tremendous force, whereas it seems to me that we think the least about this subject.
 The Gita’s statement, “ Yoga is skill    in work”libtech_800_footnotelibtech_801_footnote, is a profound thought. Yoga means union. Union with God is yoga. Mother Gita teaches that such union can be achieved without difficulty by skill in work. Anyone who aspires to cultivate such skill must become absorbed in the work and devote all his thought to it. Somebody who used to spin on the takli  and applied his mind to  the work made the important invention of the spinning-wheel, and somebody who used the spinning-wheel with careful thought invented a spinning- machine with thousands of spindles. According to me, that person exercised his intellect brilliantly, but did not use his heart. Hence, it is not enough that we should think. Our thinking should be for a good end and should be inspired by concern for dharma. However, in contrast to absence of thinking the power of intellect of the inventor of the spinning-machine certainly deserves to be admired.

 MY DEAR PADMAJA,
 Should bad handwriting be hereditary? Why should you copy Mother’s vices? Being India’s only poetess, she can afford to write a bad hand and do many other bad things. But you have no excuse. Do you know how long it took Mahadev to decipher your  letter? Supposing you were to try to write a passable hand and give the trial some of your idle moments you will be surprised at your success. You think a pot is calling Miss Kettle black, do you? Well, I am prepared to submit to a comparative test and I know that in this at least I should beat you hollow. My handwriting is wretched, I admit, but not so indecipherable as yours. Now try to be good and render voluntary obedience to the slave-driver. I hope you got my p. c. which was sent to acknowledge the oranges you sent.libtech_803_footnote

   LETTER TO PRABHUDAS GANDHI  
 
 
Y. M.,
    CHI. 	PRABHUDAS,  August 	28, 1932 
  	I have your letter. I have been able to go up to 30 counts on the 	Magan charkha up to now. I shall be satisfied if I go up to 40 	counts. The speed is very slow. It does not go beyond a hundred 	rounds an hour. It may go beyond that if I draw thick yarn. But I do 	not wish to do so. The cause of the noise that the wheel was making 	was discovered. Mahadev guessed it. The rod under the plate was 	broken and when the plate stopped functioning altogether the defect 	was discovered. On the rod being replaced the noise stopped and the 	plate also started functioning perfectly. I, too, believe with you 	that there is much room for improvement. None has occurred to me 	yet. I have got a box fixed on the plant, in which I keep the tools, 	spindle, etc. I do not consider this an improvement. For fine yarn 	we must have fine spring and fine spindle. But I doubt if a fine 	spindle would work. In the Ashram there is a spinning-wheel received 	from Darjeeling which can be worked with the foot. Examine it.  	It would be sufficient if you named the Almora Ashram just Shail 	Ashram. The word Ashram itself carries a religious meaning and 	religion includes service. Janasthan sounds pompous. Kinkarashram is 	all right but does not sound pleasant. You can call it Shail Udyog 	Mandir. But I favour Shail Ashram. Devaki Nandan uses the word 	Sevashram and so it is clear that you cannot use it.  	It is well that you paid a visit to Rajkot. It would be good if you 	rushed to Almora now. It is desirable that you should go there in 	good health. You may then devote yourself wholly to building the 	Ashram there as your only duty without having to worry about your 	health. After going there do not build castles in the air; but 	having formed a particular plan resolve not to go beyond it, nor 	even to think of doing so. As for writing, complete the work on the 	Ramayana, etc., if possible. Concentration on improving the 	Magan charkha, spinning and weaving the local cotton and wool and 	the necessary carpentry connected with it—these should be enough 	work. Since there is land it will certainly be possible to grow 	vegetables and fruit trees. Keep an account of every pie. Never go 	beyond the budget. Write to me as long as I am permitted to receive 	letters. Keep up the practice of 
 repeating Ramanama whether or not you feel any benefit from it.
 There is no doubt that ultimately it will purify and steady your mind.

   LETTER TO PARASRAM MEHROTRA  
 
     CHI. 	PARASRAM,  August 	28, 1932 
  	I got your amall booklet of nine pages. I could hardly hold my sides 	with laughter. I remember to have laughed like this only once in my 	youth when I had drunk some bhang. But please do not conclude from 	this that you should go on sending amusing books. It is for you to 	teach the boys to say sthira or khade ho 	instead of “stop”.libtech_806_footnoteUnder the intoxicating effect of your letter, I mix 	Hindi with Gujarati. I cannot explain from here how you can persuade 	the boys to do so. They must feel the power of your love and 	knowledge so that they will start using a Hindi or Urdu word for 	“stop”. As you become more and more frank and loving and humble, 	those who are learning Hindi will increasingly come to love the 	language. Any boy or boys who acquire sufficient proficiency in 	Hindi to be able to teach it to small children my certainly be given 	charge of their class.  	By showing that even Arjuna gets exhausted and that no one remains 	alive, the author of the Mahabharata has demonstrated the 	folly of armed war. The Lord’s description of Himself in the Gita 	is put by the author in His mouth. In fact God is formless and 	speaks or does nothing. The question, then, is whether such words 	can be put in God’s mouth. I feel that it can certainly be done. 	God its omnipotent and omniscient. Anything that an omniscient Being 	speaks is perfect truth, and therefore it cannot be described as 	boasting. Such description of himself by a human being would not be 	proper, since man cannot know his strength and power rightly. If, 	however, in reply to a question, a man gives his correct height, his 	doing so is not boasting but simple statement of truth. If a person 	who is five feet tall says that he is four feet tall, that is not 	humility on his part. It is either inexcusable ignorance or 	hypocrisy.  	Lady Cat and her children are always enjoying themselves and turn up 	at meal-times to claim their share. They never touch anything except 	what is offered to them.

Accordingly, he should do nothing that is not necessary. This rule applies to eating, working, resting, dressing and all other activities. I would be happy if you have the strength for all this .

   A LETTER  
 August 28, 1932
 The suggestion for five minutes’ silence during the evening prayer was mine. It would certainly be fine if this practice was adopted at both times. If all those present are sincere about observing silence, the noise is bound to stop. The children also will get used to remai- ning silent for five minutes.  I   have  even  attended   meetings  where
 
 silence was observed for half an hour. That was in England. In our country we attach great importance to voluntary silence. Samadhilibtech_808_footnotelibtech_809_footnoteis a kind of silence. The word muni also is derived from a word meaning silence. It is true that at first we feel sleepy or all kinds of thoughts come to us during the period of silence. But silence is necessary to overcome these very weaknesses. We are used to speaking and hearing all the time and, therefore, find it difficult to observe silence. After a little practice we shall come to like it and the peace which we shall feel then will be heavenly. As lovers of truth, we should understand the true meaning of silence and try to observe it in a manner which will accord with that meaning. Even during silence, one can repeat Ramanama. The real thing is that our minds should be ready for silence. A little reflection will reveal its importance. Cannot we sit quietly for five minutes in an assembly? Have you gone to see a play at any time? In many theatres talking is forbidden. An enthusiast like me would take his seat one hour before the time. The pleasure from the play would make it possible for him to remain silent for one hour. But this is not all. A play lasts for four to five hours. Do not the spectators have to remain quiet all that time? But we don’t mind that. Since the mind is ready for silence at that time, it is not felt irksome. Why, then, should it be difficult to observe five minutes’ silence for love of God? If there is any error in this reasoning, please point it out to me, and if there is none, observe the silence willingly and be my advocate and defend it before those who oppose it.
 But we should not believe that only such short-comings as we have are worth tolerating. My view is that we should  keep goodrelations with all who are striving for self-improvement. Tulsidas tells us that even God shuns people who love their short-comings, that is, look upon them as virtues.

I have explained the basic principles as well as I could. Bear in mind as many of them as you have been able to assimilate and do what seems best to you both. How long will you go on consulting me? You should consult the  self within, and do as that inner voice tells you or obey it as well as you can. I hope you remember that your question was about khadi.
 The matter of the lease must be over now. I hope you got all my letters. I wrote one more letter after reading Mr. Ritch’s letter. I hope Manilal got it.
 At the moment it seems that Devdas has recovered completely. All three of us are well. Sardar’s Sanskrit is progresing with great speed.

   LETTER TO FULCHAND B. SHAH  
 August 30, 1932
 BHAISHRI FULCHAND,
 I got your letter of the 21st. I see that my letter of July 3 was given to you on August 14. If it was kept back there all that time, it would be better if you ask me to address my letter to another prisoner whose turn for receiving a letter comes earlier than yours and who does not expect a letter from anybody else. In this way you will get my letter earlier. I always reply immediately to a letter from any of you. If we look upon the whole country as our—and we do so— theneverybody should sincerely feel that every drop of water or blade of grass anywhere in the country belongs to us. We would then use with the utmost economy anything we get in any part of the country, even if it is regarded as somebody else’s property. Even the things which are in our possession have been produced from the wealth of this country. How can we use things belonging to other people differently from those that belong to us, after we have realized that the whole country is ours? It is very necessary that, during this period of seclusion [in jail], all of us should ponder over this again and again and understand it properly. There is a large number of boys in your
 
 jail, and that increases the responsibility of the grown-ups. who supplied you all those books of literature? It is very good indeed that the prisoners there have been learning new languages and crafts.I will tell you one thing in order to inspire greater enthusiasm among you all. Here Sardar has been studying Sanskrit like a very enthusiastic young man. He has completed six parts of Satavlekar’s Pathamala and lerans five verses from the Gita daily. He is in Chapter III just now. He gives to it whatever free time he gets. His progress is wonderful. He spins also, and gives between two and two and a half hours to this work. He spins yarn of 40 counts. All this is in addition to his daily work of making envelopes. All paper with one side blank or all other useless paper on which he can lay his hands is turned into envelopes. As a result, for the last three or four months we have not had to spend money for buying a single envelope. This  is  the  meaning of turning dust into gold. He adds to the wealth of the country, no matter in how small a measure. Similarly, we exercise the utmost economy in using everything. Mahadev is learning French and Urdu and spins yarn of up to 80 counts. Brelvilibtech_811_footnotelibtech_812_footnoteis studying French, and also intends to take up Sanskrit afterwards. He, for  his  part, teaches Urdu to some Maharashtrian prisoners who are with him. Gangadharrao is learning Gujarati. Kishorelal is learning Kannada in Nasik [jail] with the help of some kannadigas.You have been doing good work there, of course. I have mentioned all this to encourage you in your efforts.
 If we cannot expect ideal behaviour from the Ashram  boys, from whom else can we expect it? I am, therefore, not surprised that you give them your certificate. Vithal must have been released now. But if he is not released, please tell him that according to me, his mother’s death was a deliverance for her, and, therefore, he should not grieve over it. He is a sensible man and has learnt to look upon death as a friend. I am not surprised to learn about Ravishankar’s devoted service. Has his constipation been cured, or does he still suffer from it? What is the news of his son who was at Vedchhi? Where is he now? We often talk about you all and think of you.

   LETTER TO BRIJKRISHNA CHANDIWALA  
 August 30, 1932
 CHI BRAJKISAN,
 Well, why didn’t you mention it earlier? I got your letters but it appears as if you have not received mine. One letter in particular was quite long as it contained the replies to your queries. How is your health? How did you find your companions? Where is Krishnan Nair? Sardar and Mahadev remember you.

        CHI. 	MIRA,    LETTER TO MIRABEHN      August 	31, 1932 
  	I got your regular letter today. I am glad you are feeling better in 	body. your recipe is not of use for me. That requires procuring 	goat’s milk butter. I do not want to go to that trouble. And I do 	not need to, as I am keeping excellent health without. I have, 	therefore, no excuse for it either. For, we may not concoct dishes 	for the pleas- ure of palate. I have done enough of that for many 	years. you need the change especially there. I don’t hesitate to 	procure what I fancy I need for the body. Today I have taken milk. 	But I propose to con- tinue bajri and see whether with milk 	it continues to keep the bowels in order. Without milk it has 	produced most excellent results. This may not be true of all 	constitutions. I have discovered this that each body has its own 	peculiarities which have to be found out.  	Tell little Lakshmi that I got her sweet little notelibtech_813_footnotebefore she was locked up. I expect her to make the 	very best use of the time she has now got. I am glad too that 	Shantabehn and Gangabehn are also with you. Tell them they must make 	up their Gujarati and make their Hindi pucca. And give them love on 	behalf of us all.  	I was quite prepared for the news that you will not be removed from 	there. You ought to be able to keep well there also. Narandas wrote 	to me about your orders for ghee and dates. I hope you have    
 both. I dropped dates because I could not get good ones weevils-free. You are able to take the hard, dry thing called khareklibtech_814_footnote. I cannot.
 I hope you will have permission to see some friends at least. But if you do not, after all we have no strangers. All strangers are friends including criminals as also the jailors. We have here learnt  to recognize friends among animals. We have a cat who is a revelation. And if we had vision enough, we should appreciate the language of trees and plants and value their friendship.
Love from us all.

      LETTER TO KUSUMBEHN DESAI    August 	31, 1932  CHI. 	KUSUM (SENIOR),  	I got your letter. You must have got my letter in which I have 	explained which letters I meant. I can see from here your 	vacillation. But it is bound to give place one day to steadiness of 	mind. I will not give up my faith.  	Do you write any time to  Khurshedbehnlibtech_815_footnote? All three of us are doing well. You probably know 	that Sardar is going ahead fast with his study of Sanskrit.

      LETTER  TO VASUDEV G. JOSHIlibtech_816_footnote    August 	31, 1932  BHAI 	VASUKAKA,  	Narandas has sent me the letter which you wrote to him. It overflows 	with your love. But I am afraid I cannot avail myself of that love. 	There is a great difference between your complaint and mine. 	Ordinarily I fell nothing. I feel the pain only when I move the arm 	in a certain manner. In any case the pain in not increasing, and it 	causes no discomfort. Doctors have only advised rest. That being so, 	even if I      
 wished to be examined by Dr. Deshmukh, probably the authorities would not be permitted to call him in. They would be allowed to call in a doctor from outside only if there was cause to fear something serious. There is no such cause in my case, and my health is perfectly good in other respects. I will, therefore, cherish your love for the present and avail myself of it only if it becomes necessary. please thank Dr. Deshmukh on my behalf for his willingness to come .
 When you were here, Sardar often talked about you and was even eager to meet you. But that was impossible, of course.
 We were filled with joy to read that, though you suffered such pain in the leg, you did not mind it. May you live long.
 You will be glad to know that Sardar has been studying Sanskrit with great earnestness.
 I have prserved the socks sent by you as symbol of your love. Please accept vandemataram from us all. Was the Gujarati your
 own?   [PS.]    MOHANDAS   At  the 	top of   your letter-paper are printed the words “  Tipe 
  	Printers”. I suppose “ Tipe” is a misprint. Such a misprint 	should not be overlooked in the letter-head.  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G. N. 3616      LETTER TO SHANTA S. PATEL    August 	31, 1932  CHI. 	SHANTA (PATEL),  	I had received the note which you wrote before you were released. I 	will wait for your promised letter. With whom do you stay? Give a 	detailed report about yourself. Let me know  about  the condition of 	both your mind and body. What did you read? Who were your friends? 	Write about all these things.

 CHI. PREMA,
   LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK  
 August 31,1932
 
  	I cannot think what fresh epithet of praise I should give you this 	time. Tell me what epithet will please you, and I will give you 	that. I 	have not yet received the books required for Parachure Shastri. I 	hope I shall get them soon.  	I do not think we can say that the arrival of those two women means 	that educated women have started joining the Ashram. There are 	certainly a few stray cases of such women turning up. The Ashram has 	not attracted any of them to stay on, unless we regard you as an 	educated woman as also one who has stayed on. Your case, then, will 	be an exception, Who will believe that one swallow makes a summer?  	I am sorry about Rambhau. I do not mind your  having dismissed him 	from the class. Keep a watchful eye on him and bring him to the 	right path if you can. I understand your  difficulty  regarding 	Dhiru. If you can cultivate sufficient broadmindedness and courage, 	you should  talk  about  him  to  Joshilibtech_817_footnotelibtech_818_footnoteand 	 Ramabehn  and discover some way of winning him over to the right 	path. We ourselves plant thorns in our path and thencomplain about 	being pricked by them. We shall probably never reach our goal if we 	try to do so with our own strength but, if we march with God’s 	strength, we shall see light even in darkness. If you retort that 	you do not have such love in you, my advice is of no value. If, 	again, you argue that though I believe that I am full of love I have 	not been able to win over many, and ask me what right I have to 	advise you, and thus close the door of your heart against me, I 	would be helpless. I admit my imperfection. Why should you take that 	as an example? You should follow the advice I give you from my 	experience. We should not take the weaknesses of co-workers as our 	guide but should try to be free from them and embrace only their 	virtues. Moreover, unlike you I do not accept defeat but hope, with 	God’s grace, to melt the stoniest heart and, therefore, 	continually strive to perfect myself.  	If you have been reading out newspapers in the kitchen and jesting 	with people, I would certainly not approve of that.  There should be 	perfect silence in the kitchen. Why should you read out anything 	there? Moreover, Narandas’s attention is bound to be    
 occupied with the things around him. I do not approve of your reading out anything in such an atmosphere. In the kitchen, even if you read you should do so seriously. Do, therefore, make this change. Consider what example you would be setting to the children if you make jokes in the kitchen and try to make people laugh. If all of them start doing what you do, the kitchen would  become  a  “bear’s garden” and discipline would vanish. Can the “smart” brain of the ‘smart little girl” understand all this, or has she lost her”smartness” in the Ashram?
This is enough for this time.

         CHI. 	PANDITJI,    LETTER TO NARAYAN M. KHARE    August 	31, 1932 
  	I got your letter. Like Anandi, others also will gradually become 	interested in the Gita, provided our own interest in it 	remains sincere.  I do not think your trying to reform Rambhau is 	likely to do any good. He seems to have no sense of right and wrong. 	I cherish the hope that some day his eyes will open.  	I will write today to Anandi advising her to drink milk and take 	rest. I cannot immediately suggest from here a suitable time-table 	for her. It will be enough if, without getting tired, she does 	anything in which she feels interested. Children with weak health 	must not feel any burden on them.  	Who filled Lakshmibehn’s molar? This is a very delicate job. The 	filling should not be done till the cavity is completely cleaned. If 	there is the slightest negligence in this matter, decay starts 	inside and that does harm.  	The letters dictated by Mohan and others are good. This shows that 	intellectual growth has little connection with knowledge of letters. 	Linking the former with the latter results in considerable loss of 	orginality. If we impart as much knowledge as can be done orally and 	teach the alphabet as calligraphy, childern will by themselves 	slowly learn to read and understand books.  BAPU

Whatever you do 	should be neat and well done, no matter if the speed is slow. Speed 	will increase slowly.

You should know that the 	mother’s feelings always affect the child. We must do our best. 	There should then be no cause for panic. I am keeping Ramdas 	informed.

 CHI. ANASUYABEHN,
 Your letter with the rakhi arrived, though rather late. All the time I have been wanting to reply but I can manage it only now. You did not write about Indu’s health. Do so now. How is Mridula? According to Dahyabhai, she has written to me but I have not so far received the letter. How is Saraladevi ?
I keep thinking of you all.
 All the three of us are well. How is your health? And what news of Gulzarilal?

  LETTER TO ASHRAM BOYS AND GIRLS 
 YERAVDA MANDIR,libtech_832_footnote
 September 1, 1932
 DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS,
 I got the letter, written in beautiful handwriting, by your new secretary. I hope that the new office-bearers will discharge their duties well. By assuming responsibilities in this way you will advance very far. Associations like yours can run smoothly only if you are tolerant towards one another. If you learn to do this, you will get in time the ability to run big associations. Keep sending me weekly reports of your work. If any disputes arise, you should write about those too. The best thing, of course, is that there should be no disputes. But in case a dispute does arise, there would be no benefit in keeping it from me. If I know about it, I may be able to guide you. Moreover, the knowledge that you will have to inform me may itself save you from quarrels.

I may 	say that intellect has had very little share in shaping my life. I 	believe that I have a rather poor intellect. I have found it 	literally true in my case that God shows the means to the man who 	has faith. I always hold elders and men of spiritual knowledge in 	high respect and put faith in them. And my deepest faith is in 	truth, and because of that I have always found my path easy even 	when it is beset with difficulties. I 	am happy that your health is improving.

 I have your letter. This time your handwriting is better. If you keep up the effort it will gradually improve. You say that you have learnt everything. This cannot be true. There are many things to be learnt. Your Gujarati is still very weak. You have yet to learn Sanskrit. Ginning, carding, weaving, sewing, embroidery, spinning yarn of fine count—all this remains.
 You should know arithmetic and also learn nursing. You will learn all this in time.
 Speak less, think more. I understand what you say about your dress. At the moment, I cannot think of anything against it.
I wish you to become a very good girl.

  	I got your lettter. You have given plenty of information in it. It 	is good that you are eating fruit. There is no harm if  you  stop 	spinning when you get tired. You will not get tired if you draw the 	thread with the right hand and rotate the wheel with the foot. That 	is what I do. if, however, even that is a strain, then you may stop 	spinning. If you can, do embroidery or sewing. If you do not get 	cotton slivers, you may spin wool. Teach Sheela with proper care. 	Just now, she need not trace and retrace the letters. A lot can be 	taught orally. For instance, you can teach arithmetic in that 	manner.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 6137. Also C.W. 3489. Courtesy: 	Prabhudas Gandhi

 I am absolutely certain that you would do credit to the post of a secretary. Do not work beyond your capacity. And, do  not  be  deterred by anything that may happen. You should never worry. How is it that your yarn snaps so often on the takli? Luck and perseverance contribute in equal measure in every act we do. We can control our efforts, so, let us work to our fullest capacity and leave the result to luck. The Gita teaches us this very lesson.

 I have received your letter. It is very good that a sanatorium has been opened in the sacred memory of Bhai Shantilal. Are there any restrictions of caste or community for getting admission there? Pyarelal wrote to me that he had met you.
 How nice it would be if you could learn enough to improve your Gujarati from the teacher who is coming. You may brush aside my suggestion if you find it burdensome. But if you are keen to learn, you must follow it in practice as much as possible.
 I never had an opportunity of reading the books that you have mentioned.

  A LETTERlibtech_846_footnote 
 September 1, 1932
 I had asked Dilip to send me your name. I have ventured to write to you, though I do not remember that we have met any time. It has always been my view regarding children’s education that we obstruct their intellectual growth and spoil their handwriting by beginning with the alphabet. I am of the opinion that, before teaching the alphabet, we should give them orally a good deal of general knowledge. Beginning with the history and geography of the child’s city or village, we should tell him something of the region, the country and the world as also of Nature’s beauty, the sky, the trees and plants and teach him orally a little of arithmetic, geometry, and literature, i.e., correct pronunciation, grammar, poems, Sanskrit verses, etc. For doing any one of these, it is absolutely unnecessary first to teach reading and writing. The child should learn to read before he is taught to write. Writing should come last. Before he starts learning the alphabet, he should learn some drawing. After learning thoroughly how to draw straight lines, oblique lines, triangles, etc., the child should begin to draw pictures of the letters of the alphabet. If we follow this method, learning will not be a painful process to the child, he will  have acquired a considerable amount of general knowledge through oral instruction and the letters drawn by the child will be like pearls. There is a chapter on the subject of good handwriting in  Dasbodhlibtech_847_footnotelibtech_848_footnote, which is worth reading and pondering over. The sight of Dilip’s handwriting prompted me to write this, from which you may accept whatever appeals to you and forget the rest. My view is supported by my own very bad handwriting. It is the result of a wrong education.

If, however, the rat is determined, the cat cannot eat it 	alive. Thus, a rat which saves itself from the mouth of a cat does 	no violence to the cat. Do you understand this?

         DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER TO DR. HIRALAL SHARMA   September 	2, 1932 
  	I have your letter. What you have heard or read about nature 	institutions in the West is a case of distance lending enchantment 	to the scene. Of the best  advertised  institution,  people  of  the 	 place knew nothing when a friend enquired about it. This does not 	mean that there is nothing in them. My only point is that the whole 	of this science is yet in its infancy and that there is no common 	course adopted by these institutions. They are what they are through 	the original researches of their authors. We in India have to make 	our own researches in keeping with our surroundings. Whatever is to 	be gained from them can be easily learnt through their publications.  	As to your own health I simply gathered from your letter that it was 	not up to much. You cannot afford to go by  the  cases  of orthodox 	physicians. You are a pioneer and will therefore have to show a 	record that would stand the most rigorous scrutiny.  	I am glad you have given up the idea of going to the West. Do 	buildup your own body. That in itself will lead you to many 	discoveries. Your progress may be slow but it will be sure, if the 	foundation is sound. . . .  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI  Bapuki 	Chhayamen Mere Jivanke Solah Varsh, 	pp. 12-3     LETTER TO DR.

 will please report your progress from time to time. It was quite like Malaviyaji to have visited you and blessed you.libtech_852_footnote
 Have you or the doctors who have been helping you discovered the cause of your illness? Why should you, who were to all appear- ances so healthy, have been caught by the germs of a dangerous malady?

            PANDITJI,   LETTER TO NARAYAN M. KHARE   September 	3, 1932 
  	You did well in writing to me regarding the temple. If you have 	still something more to say, write to me. I surely don’t insist 	that my view in this matter should prevail. However, my views on 	this subject are fixed. I have said regarding myself that I am both 	an image- worshipper and an image-breaker. The God conceived by a 	human being is bound to be a form, though the image may be only in 	the mind. In that sense, I am an image-worshipper. But I have never 	been willing to worship any form or image as God. Towards a form or 	image, I always feel  neti, netilibtech_853_footnotelibtech_854_footnote. Hence I regard myself as image-bre- aker. This being 	my attitude, I have always felt that we should not have any temple 	in the Ashram. And it was for this reason that we decided to have no 	building even for prayers. We sit in the open, with the sky above as 	the roof and the horizons on the four sides as the walls. If we wish 	to maintain an attitude of equality towards all religions, this is 	how we should live. These days, I am trying to read a little from 	the Vedas and other sacred books. I see this same thing in them all. 	There is no mention of image-worship anywhere. But Hindusim has a 	place for it. We should not, therefore, oppose it. However, 	image-worship is not obligatory. It is voluntary. I feel, there-     
 fore, that it would be better if, as an institution, we kept away from image-worship. If what I have always believed to be a samadhi is really a temple, we should not make it a place of public worship. When the owner of the land wished to demolish the structure and carry away the bricks, I paid money to him against the estimated value of the bricks and saved the structure. But I do not wish to turn it into a temple. You may discuss this with others who are likely to understand my attitude, and then write to me again if you wish. Do not have the slightest hesitation in expressing your view.

  LETTER TO PARASRAM MEHROTRA 
 September 3, 1932
 CHI. PARASRAM,
 I have your letter and the questions. You may leave me if you like—that may happen though I do not wish it to happen. I, however, will never leave you, for I still want many services from you. There is a prescription which I always recommend, and you should  never forget it. As soon as we feel the slightest anger or aversion against a co-worker or think that he has done us injustice, we should sink into deep meditation and tell ourselves: ‘I certainly deserve such treatment. The fault is not my co-worker’s but mine. Knowingly or unkn- owingly, I must have given him some cause to be angry with me or feel aversion against me.’ When the mind is so persuaded and has calmed down, you should immediately go to the co-worker and ask him what fault he had seen in you. We should then examine ourselves to see that fault and overcome it. If we follow this method, we shall always enjoy peace, feel generous towards the whole world and never feel offended with anyone.
 I am satisfied if the massage has really cured the pain. In such a matter, one should never deceive oneself. Do not be afraid of a surgical operation if it becomes necessary.
 Of course there was the hand of Fate in the sinking of that boat, but we can see from it the fear which rules our people. It also shows how great is the fear of death in us. If the people had kept their reason to see that the serpent could not have bitten all of them, any one of them could have picked it up and thrown it into the river or even killed it, if he so wished. But where nobody thinks of others and
 everybody is seized with fear, the result is bound to be what happened. The only lesson we have to draw from this is that we should never have fear of any kind and we should pray to God to grant us good sense when we unexpectedly find ourselves in such situations.

I convey the information to 	Ramdas as and when I think fit. I had expected a postcard today, but 	there was none. Pyare Alilibtech_858_footnotehad sent me a wire about Qureshi’slibtech_859_footnoteoperation. I have also       
 had a letter from him. I hope Champalibtech_860_footnotelibtech_861_footnotegot the postcard I wrote to her. Please make whatever arrangements are possible for the education of the new girls who join. I constantly feel that you should get more free time to think about and plan things such as this. We have done much for Liladharlibtech_862_footnotelibtech_863_footnote. If he does not understand his place or his self-interest, how can we help him? Do only what   seems  proper  to  you.  Indulibtech_864_footnoteyearns for parental love. Try to understand his heart. Read my letter to Kusumlibtech_865_footnotelibtech_866_footnote. If she takes careful measures, she will be completely all right. If, however, she takes rest and employs other remedies just to please you, she will lose her life altogether or else will become an invalid and then weep. I intend to devote the weekly article this time to Narayanappa’s case It will contain some thoughts which may seem novel. Try to understand them and then explain them to the girls. My chief reason for resuming milk from Wednesday was to see whether bajri would be effective, in spite of the milk, in preventing constipation. Today is Saturday. There has been no ill-effect till now and in other respects my health has been quite good. So far bajri and bananas have not disagreed with me.
 What you say about Parasram is correct. Though he is extremely unmethodical, he has seemed to me a useful man. His motives are good. Sometimes he exhibits great capacity for work.
 Shankarbhai’s hand should be completely cured by now. Is the bone-setter a man trained in the indigenous method or has he been qualified in Allopathy?
 Vinoba’s plan is indeed excellent. If we have the right type of men, there is plenty of work which they can do.I received today Chhakkaddas’s and Keshu’s slivers. I now want the thinnest spindle you can get. Only if I get it, can I carry on my experiment here properly. I got the books too. How far they tally with the ones I had asked you to send, I shall perhaps let you know after I have checked them.
 Do we get money for Kaka’s milk and ghee? We should, for he was supplied these items in Belgaum by the Government.  If  they don’t supply these to him there we must do so. But we should not act
 
 
 like the woman who ignorantly gives away the butter along with the whey, and is called a fool into the bargain. If necessary, go and see the Superintendent and talk the matter over with him.
 I  have   suggested   in   a   letter   to   Maganbhailibtech_867_footnotelibtech_868_footnotea   title   for   the discourseslibtech_869_footnotelibtech_870_footnote. But on second thoughts it seems to me that we need not be in a hurry to print them. I have written them in great haste. You and other people there may correct my mistakes as you read the discourses, and even if you did not understand some point I would not worry much. I would not mind even if you found that a few sentences here and there were not sufficiently clear.It is not always possible for me to revise the discourses after writing them. Hence, if they are to be published I should certainly like to read them from that point of view before they are published. I would, therefore, suggest that, if you have not incurred any expense so far, you should postpone their publication.If, however, Maganbhai, Panditji, Chhaganlalif he is thereand you feel no doubt about the meaning of any sentence and if, whenever the language was not clear, you have been able to make it clear, you may certainly print them. You have suggested Mangal Prabhat-II as the title, but it does not seem to me appropriate, for the discourses on this occasion were written from a somewhat different point of view. That is, I had in mind mostly the inmates of the Ashram when writing them. That is why I have suggested the title Ashramvasi Pratyelibtech_871_footnotelibtech_872_footnoteso that readers may know the limitations of the discourses and those of them who look upon themselves as among  the  inmates, though they do not live in the Ashram, may understand that they are addressed to them too. But I don’t insist on this title being accepted. You may choose any other that may appeal to all of you.
 Think about Manjula’slibtech_873_footnotelibtech_874_footnotedilemma. If her disease can be cured with cod-liver oil, it would perhaps be the right thing to give it to her.  I don’t think she can think for herself. She will probably depend on Kashi’slibtech_875_footnotelibtech_876_footnoteadvice in which case she should follow it. And if Kashi does
 
 not want to give her that, it should not be given. But if Manjula, though only a child, understands things a little and would like to take it I think we should respect her wish. You may now do what you think best.
 While writing the history of the Ashram, a thought occurred to me. I have a faint recollection that I wrote to you about it once. I don’t know if we have a list of the persons who came and stayed in the Ashram temporarily from the time of its establishment to the present day. If we don’t have such a list, we should try to remember the names and write them down. They should be noted in a register, which should contain the full name of every such person, his place of residence, age, occupation, education, marital status and similar information; also what he learnt in the Ashram, when he left it and where he is at present. Whenever anybody comes to the Ashram in future, his name should be entered in the register, so that all this information will be available to us in one place. My only aim just now in asking for this information is to know how many persons came to and stayed in the Ashram temporarily, how each of them was trained and where he is settled now. If we have kept no such record till now, as time passes it will become increasingly more difficult to prepare one.
 The pieces of leather for repairing the soles of sandals which you sent a second time have also been used up. These pieces are of such poor quality that, though I use the sandals very sparingly, the repaired soles hardly give service for a month. Like a miser, I also send small bits of leather for repair of soles. But we must make do with whatever quality of leather of dead cattle we can get. Please, therefore, send one or two pieces again.
 [September] 4, 1932libtech_877_footnote
 Hemprabhadevilibtech_878_footnotelibtech_879_footnoteused to write to me regularly. Of late I have had no letter from her except for a postcard once. Do you hear from her? If you do, give me news of her health. And write her a letter or postcard. And tell her that I complain about absence of letters from her, and that I should get her letters regularly. If she has been writing and if she has preserved the dates of the letters, she should let me have them. Probably she has been writing. Sometimes letters  get   lost   in
 
 
 transit. Her letters are not likely to have been lost here, but it  is possible that they did not reach this place at all.
 I hope you have dispatched the postal acknowledgment for the registration of the Anantpur report.libtech_880_footnoteI enclose a photograph sent by Devdas. Show it to Ba too.
   [PS.]  BAPU    	After I had written the above, I sat down to write the article for 
  	the women. I have just finished it. I think it is very important. 	But probably they will find it difficult to understand the article. 	If you do not understant it fully, do not show it to the new group. 	Write to me about it. If you are convinced of its truth and can see 	ahimsa in that slap, you may certainly read it to them solving each 	difficulty that may be raised as you proceed. This is what I would 	suggest. If, after reading the article, you feel that you have 	understood it, give it to Panditji and other senior persons to read. 	Prema also should read it. If these persons understand it, show it 	to all others, and particularly to women, for it is primarily meant 	for them. Of course this  article should not be published. It can be 	easily misunderstood. Those who have the spirit of ahimsa in them 	would understand it without difficulty. In any case, they would not 	misunderstand it. An article like this may be published only when I 	am outside. For the present, it will be enough if all of you 	understand it. If my reasoning is correct and if I am right about my 	experience, I am sure that most people who try to follow those ideas 	in practice are bound to realize their truth.

  WHAT WOMEN SHOULD DO IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION 
 [September 4, 1932]libtech_881_footnoteTouching upon non-violence, if some maniac should try to assault a woman, and if another man should happen to be present,
should he not protect her honour with the use of a weapon? Should
 not women train themselves in the use of weapons and learn to protect themselves? I have given my opinion. Use of weapons would certainly imply violence but I have never permitted anyone to draw from this the inference that a man or woman who happens to be present should not run to the rescue of the woman and should tolerate an outrage on her modesty. On the contrary, I have said that the man who allows the modesty of a woman to be thus outraged will be regarded as a coward. He will be a partner in violence because violence is implicit in cowardice. It is my firm opinion that heroic violence is less sinful than cowardly violence. A heroic man or woman can learn the lesson of non-violence, it is pretty nearly impossible for a coward to learn it. I have not begun this article in order to repeat all this. One will find these ideas in many other places in my writings.
 But there is one thing which I think I have not remarked upon anywhere else which I wish to put down. I have dissuaded the Ashram women from learning the tricks of  jamaiyalibtech_882_footnotelibtech_883_footnote, etc.  The  woman  who depends on a jamaiya or a gothilibtech_884_footnotelibtech_885_footnoteto guard her honour may some day fail to do so. When someone snatches away the jamaiya or the gothi from her, she will become defenceless, so that there is a possibility of her falling into the hands of a maniac.      libtech_886_footnotelibtech_887_footnoteSita had no weapons. But
 she had soul-force. Hence her consent was necessary before Ravana could so much as touch her. Our sisters should have self-confidence of this kind. Hence we have introduced Draupadi’s prayer specially for women. But we were discussing an ideal. When a woman is faced by a maniac, what is she to do? If she truly has courage in her and also compassion, instead of becoming panicky she will melt him with the radiance of her compassion. But if that emotion has not arisen in her, she will certainly become enraged. In her rage she will slap him
 
 and raise such a row that he will run away from the scene. Or he will fall at her feet then and there. That is to say, the woman will use all her physical strength. Will that not constitute violence? If that is to be so, why not carry a weapon? My opinion is that there is violence in carrying and learning to use a weapon. But in a situation like the above, slapping or scratching, if the occasion demands it, does not constitute violence. If there is violence in a mouse biting a cat, the conduct of a woman in such a situation would also constitute violence. The trust of a woman who slaps is not in the slap, her trust is in God. Only compassion has not awakened her, while anyone can become enraged. Her rage will indicate her opposition. When a lecherous man approaches a woman, he does so in the belief that he will be able to subdue her, that is to say, that desire will also ultimately possess her. How is the woman to show that this cannot happen? Either by calm but immense compassion or by shouting and struggling. Slapping and so on is like the struggling of a mouse against a cat. The woman’s slap certainly cannot cause any injury to the lecher. This will be evident, if we go deeper into it. Here I do not have in mind women of a giant’s strength. Such a woman will be blinded by the consciousness of her strength. She may be faced by a man of greater strength and she may then surrender herself to him. Here I have in mind Ashram girls or women without physical strength who repose their trust in soul-force. Their slap is not an expression of violence, only of their opposition. Their cry will render that lustful man meek, because crime itself has no strength and he who has come to commit an offence knows it. This belief of mine implies that the woman will not even till death surrender herself to the man. Her anger, her alarm, proclaims for herself as well as for the man her preparedness to die. For what I have pictured may not happen and the maniac instead of becoming meek at the woman’s anger, may hit her and determine to throw her on the ground. If at that time the woman is defeated, if she does not think of God, if she loses her self-confidence, she will be trembling, so that it will not occur to her to die. Even if it occurs to her to die, she will not know how to die. Fear, . . .libtech_888_footnotelibtech_889_footnoteself-confidence become utterly weak. And enthusiasm in her . . . libtech_890_footnoteThis is merely to warn women. It is quite possible for her to be in a state where she may think: ‘I do not have such faith in God that I shall be able to get rid of the maniac by
 
 my purity alone. Bapu has said that one must not use a weapon; for that will be violence. One may then not use even one’s hands. What, O God, am I to do ! Oh! I am dying.’ Such a thought is intolerable to me. This instruction of mine is not meant only for one  man  or woman. There is no question of my instruction rendering anyone weak. If anyone becomes so, it will be due to their own misunderstanding. The above suggestion is to clarify my thought. Women should just forget that they are the weaker sex. She who has the desire and the strength to die can never be regarded as weak. There is danger to the body, not to the soul. The soul which has attenuated its relation to the body, has made it absolutely insignificant like a blade of grass, cannot be harassed or defeated even by all the maniacs of the world. This lesson should be learnt by every boy and girl who is of an age to understand it. It is to impart this lesson that I have made the above observation. Instead of feeling helpless and scared, she should say to herself: ‘I shall offer up my body and life, but shall not become a coward.’ Her slap or scratching indicates this resolve. It is in itself an act of non-violence. She has no strength to cause harm. Hence her act is not violence; but it has power to move a lecherous mind and to awaken the woman who administers the slap.

  LETTER TO SETH GOVINDDAS 
 September 3/4,1932
 BROTHER GOVINDDAS,
 I have received your letter as well as the deed of renunciation.libtech_891_footnoteI have received them only today as they have been going round from one Government office to another. I learn from the newspapers that the letters I wrote before this have been duly received.
 Your letter of renunciation is very touching, so is your father’s letter. I am sure he could not have acted differently. It is no ordinary matter to give up attachment. We cannot expect from the older people the same spirit of renunciation that has been awakened in the youth of this era. I have no doubt that your total renunciation is all to the good.  I had forgotten that episode of 1921 but now I can recollect it. I am confident that the affection between you two will now become deeper. It is quite likely that your father will now make some sacrifice or
 
 other. It is a good thing that you are as devoted to him as before. Did you   have   the   support   from   Bindanidevilibtech_892_footnotein   this   matter?   Is   she educated? I hope that her health will gradually improve. May your purity of heart increase. Sardar and Mahadev too thank you. I had read about your letter of renunciation but I did not feel it proper to write upon it from here. I can now write this because your letter has been allowed to reach me. But I would advise you to refrain from sending this to the newspapers.
 Yours,
 MOHANDAS
[PS.]
 After writing this I have received an acknowledgment of my postcard. I hope that Bindanidevi is improving in health.libtech_893_footnote

           DEAR 	SISTER,   LETTER TO SATYAVATI CHIDAMBER   September 	4, 1932 
  	I have your letter. Why do you think that the truth lies only in 	believing in Jesus as you do? Again why do you think  that  an 	orthodox Hindu cannot follow out the precepts of the Sermon on the 	Mount? Are you sure of your knowledge of an orthodox Hindu? And then 	are you sure again that you know Jesus and His teachings? I admire 	your zeal but I cannot congratulate you upon your wisdom. My 	forty-five years of prayer and meditation have not only left me 	without the assurance of the type you credit yourself with, but have 	left me humbler than ever. The answer to my prayer is clear and 	emphatic that God is not encased in a safe to be approached only 	through a little hole bored in it, but that He is open to be 	approached through billions of openings by those who are humble and 	pure of heart. I invite you to step down from your pinnacle where 	you have left room for none but yourself. With 	love and prayer,  Yours,  M. K. G.  Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, Vol. I, pp. 	395-6

  LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL JOSHI 
 September 4, 1932
 CHI. CHHAGANLAL (JOSHI),
 There was no letter from you in this week’s post. It rarely happens that the week’s post contains no letter from you, and, therefore, when there is none, I miss it. I read in Narandas’s letter that you had gone to bring Dhirulibtech_894_footnotelibtech_895_footnoteto the Ashram. Let me know how he is.
 I had sent to you, when you were [in the Camp Jail] here, a book named Flowers of St. Francis. Have you or anybody else taken it away? Mohanlallibtech_896_footnotelibtech_897_footnotewrites to tell me that he cannot find it among the books with him. And it has not been returned to me. Please look for it. Its special value lies in the fact that it was received as a gift from a lady in Europe and contained her good wishes. A few passages in it are also marked. Don’t mind if you cannot recollect where it is.
 If you have met Nanabhai, let me know how he is. I hope you have preserved your health. Ordinarily Vasumati would not neglect to write to me, but this time, though I had written to her and asked her to write to me after she was released, I have not heard from her. There are many other women, too, who have not written to me. But their conduct doesn’t appear as strange as Vasumati’s for they were not regular correspondents. Inquire about Vasumati. And  remind  the other women too.

  DISCUSSION WITH MAHADEV DESAIlibtech_901_footnote 
 September 4, 1932
 It  then  seems  you  have  not  understood  my   article.libtech_902_footnoteI   have actually pointed out that a slap rouses oneself, makes oneself fearless and above all, gives oneself the strength to die. A wicked person is not prepared for such, in his eyes senseless, resistance. In all probability, therefore, he would run away. But I attach less importance to that. The strength which is aroused in that woman enables her to end her life. By the time that the maniac has overpowered her, the woman has already sought protection in death; for she struggles prepared for death and has no thought of hitting the man. All that she has to do is to go on repeating Ramanama. I suggest this remedy for all circumstances, and only for those women who are pure and who want to defend themselves against attack non-violently. This article is based on my own experience. When I held on to that bar,libtech_903_footnotelibtech_904_footnoteI was mentally prepared for death. I could not have inflicted any serious injury on my assailant. If, however, I had lost hold of the bar, I would have struggled on, would perhaps have slapped or bitten the  man  and would have resisted till death. I would not have committed violence by
 
 fighting in this manner. For, I could not have inflicted any injury upon him, nor was it my intention. I only wished to die and to avoid the necessity of sitting at the opponent’s feet. This is the real test of non-violence. One’s aim should not be to inflict pain nor should pain be the result.
 M. D. I understand, but the purest of girls cannot subdue a hooligan with one slap and is helpless if she has to face a number of them.
GANDHIJI: Not only I but medical jurisprudence holds it
 impossible for a woman to be outraged so long as she does not relax. A woman who is not ready to die relaxes, may be reluctantly, and submits to the hooligan. A desperate animal breaks its bonds or else breaks itself, and every animal is capable of exerting so  much strength. The fact is that love of life is too strong for one to hold fast till death. A woman who puts forth the utmost strength will have herself torn to bits and her ribs broken in fighting the assailant.
 M. D. To a woman of such purity it is not necessary to suggest slapping or anything of that kind. She will herself think out some plan or other.
GANDHIJI: I may explain it all only after I break the silence.

 APPENDIX
 
 DISCUSSION ON COMMUNAL AWARD libtech_905_footnote
 August 17, 1932
 The communal decision was published today. Bapu went about his work till the evening as if nothing had happened.	I  said the new constitution was worse than
 the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms. “Certainly”, replied Bapu. “Those reforms were based on the Lucknow agreement between Congress and the Muslim League. But this constitution seeks to create such divisions in the country that it can never again stand up on its own legs.” Just before the evening prayer he said to me, “Well, you and the Sardar think over the situation and tell me whatever you feel like saying. The letter to Samuel Hoare details the steps I should take in order to deal with the present situation.     I have therefore to serve the British Government with a notice.”. and then Bapu
 began to write the letter to MacDonald.
 August 18, 1932
 After finishing it in the morning Bapu said, “You stop spinning for a while and go through this letter so that it may be sent at once.” The Sardar and I read it. Then he [Sardar] said, “There is no reference in the letter to other parts of the decision. May not this be misinterpreted to mean that they are approved by you?” “No”, replied Bapu. “My views are well known. Still if you wish, I will insert one paragraph, although I would then have to enter into argument. In this letter I propose to leave out all argument, this having been included in the letter to Samuel Hoare.” I suggested that Bapu should only say his soul rebelled against the decision as a whole, but part of it was so vicious that he would lay down his life in the attempt to get it annulled. “No”, said Bapu. “No such comparison may fairly be instituted. If it were, they would say that I wanted to get the decision annulled in its entirety and had seized upon a certain part of it as a pretext. I do want the whole decision to go. But at night I thought for a moment over the question whether other points should be included and decided against their inclusion.”
 The same subject was discussed in the evening. Bapu observed, “I cannot put in other things at all, for that would be tantamount to mixing politics with religion. The two questions are in fact distinct from each other.” He then continued, “I have rehearsed everything in my own mind. Everything you have suggested  was  considered by me before I reached the decision. Separate electorates for the Muslims and the rest are fraught with danger. They will combine with the British to
 
 suppress the Hindus. But I can think of methods by which the combination can be dealt with. When once the outsider who foments quarrels is gone, we can tackle our problems with success. But as regards the so-called untouchables I have no other remedy. How possibly am I to explain things to these poor fellows? To draw suffering on oneself when misfortune dogs one’s footsteps is no novelty. How did Sudhanva fall into the pan full of hot oil and how did Prahlad embrace a pillar of red-hot iron? There will be many satyagraha movements even after the attainment of swaraj. I have often had the idea that after the establishment of swaraj I should go to Calcutta and try   to stop animal sacrifice offered in the name of religion. The goats at Kalighat are worse off even than untouchables. They cannot attack men with their horns. They can never throw up an Ambedkar from their midst. My blood boils when I think of such violence. Why do they not offer tigers instead of goats?”
 In the morning we discussed the possible repercussions of Bapu’s step. I said, “It will be misinterpreted in a variety of ways. Here in India there will be senseless imitation of it while in America they will say Gandhi obtained his release by his fast.” “I know”, replied Bapu. “In America they will swallow anything, and there are British agents ready to help them to do so. Many will even say that I am now a bankrupt, that my spirituality is not paying dividends; therefore, I committed suicide like cunning insolvents. And in this country there will be blind imitation, and misinterpretation. The Government will perhaps release me and let me die outside prison, or perhaps they will let me die in jail, as in the case of MacSwiney. Our own men will be critical. Jawaharlal will not like it at all. He will say we have had enough of such religion. But that does not matter. When I am going to wield a most powerful weapon in my spiritual armoury, misinterpretation and the like may never act as a check.”
 August 19, 1932
 The Superintendent came and asked why Bapu was going to take such a drastic step. He replied there was no alternative. The Superintendent suspected that Hoare had perhaps not even informed the British Cabinet. Bapu said, “I believe he must have informed them. But your suspicion is not ill-placed. Hoare is a man of such a type that he might not inform them. And when the Cabinet comes to know of it, he will say he did not think he should worry them with the case of a man who was ready to die for such a trifle. But I think if he did not inform the Cabinet, he would lose his career as well as reputation.” The Superintendent asked what effect Bapu’s fast would have in England. “None”, replied Bapu. “Even if all the untouchables in a body ask for joint electorates, the British can say that in the case of a minority which has been suppressed for centuries they alone can decide what is good for it; the suppressors cannot understand its needs.” He then continued, “ My whole life has been passed that way. This last step of mine is the crown of my career. I had no idea that I
 would have to give up my life for this. But it is a noble object. The beginning was made 50 years ago, when as a child I began to smoke and then felt I was doing the wrong thing and must make a clean breast of it. Since then I have made continuous progress in the knowledge and the practice of truth.”
 The Collector came in the afternoon and said : “What can they do if they are not to give such a decision? There must be some solution. In matters like this you cannot insist upon absolute justice and right.” “No”, replied Bapu. “The solution may be unreasonable but it must be acceptable to all. But there is no agreement at the back of this decision. They asked us for a solution in England but they did not see that they were addressing a packed house, and therefore their demand could never be satisfied.”. . .
 In the morning Bapu said, “It is a law of satyagraha that when a man has no weapon in his hands and when he cannot think of a way out, he should take the final step of giving up his body. What did the Rajput women do? What did Kamalavati about whom we were reading the other day do? She had resolved that she would not fall alive into the hands of the enemy. She therefore embraced death as a dear friend.”

 The Sardar and I thought today that the news of Bapu’s impending fast should be passed on to the outside world by some means or other. But that was impossible without a breach of Bapu’s promise. He has promised that he on his part would never send the news out. And we could not be disloyal to him. The Sardar was very much worried . . . .

 “People will tell us”, said the Sardar, “that we were here with you and should have somehow or other sent the information outside, say, through Dahyabhai who sees me every week.”
 “That is not to be thought of”, replied Bapu. “Can we tell them that we would now inform the outside world of this by some means or other? We have promised to maintain absolute secrecy from our side, and that is the end of the matter so far as we are concerned. You must have noticed that in the letter I have addressed to MacDonald    I have said with perfect indifference that if he made it possible, I wanted public opinion to be affected by my letters. What can they do, supposing Malaviyaji and Rajagopalachari come to know about the impending fast this very day? It is a matter of only a few days. I think it is necessary to give a slight shock even to these two leaders. Rajaji is a clever man and will at once understand why I was driven to take this step. The shock will help him to understand it. Don’t you see that I have advanced no argument in this letter? Could I not have framed a long indictment? But I restricted myse lf to this one point for which I would gladly sacrifice my life. I had reserved my life for a nobler purpose, but meanwhile this occasion has arisen. What

 can I do now? The satyagraha is directed not against Congressmen who are in jail, but against non-Congressmen in order to make them understand what they are doing. Don’t you see none of them is at all perturbed by the British Government’s proposals as regards untouchability? This inertia is sickening, and it cannot be dealt with in any other way. The possible consequences of separate electorate for Harijans fill me with horror. Separate electorate for all other communities will still leave room for me to deal with them, but I have no other means to deal with untouchables. These poor fellows will ask why I who claim to be their friend should offer satyagraha simply because they were granted some privileges; they would vote separately but vote with me. They do not realize that the separate electorate will create division among Hindus so much so that it will lead to bloodshed. Untouchable hooligans will make common cause with Muslim hooligans and kill caste Hindus. Has the British Government no idea of all this? I do not think so. And to cap it all, they have brought in Irwin. The Archbishop of Canterbury said they could not do without Irwin’s co-operation. And now the Christian Irwin is a party to this nefarious scheme.”
 “No, no, Vallabhbhai. Previous publication of the news will only do harm; sudden shock is the treatment required. It would be different if you felt that this was a serious blunder. You are both associated with it; and therefore you are responsible to some extent, but the final responsibility rests with me alone, for I have done what suggested itself to me. This is a case in which no one else’s consent is necessary. When I fasted during the Bombay riots, C. R. Das and Motilal Nehru insisted that I should have consulted them before undertaking it. But I explained that the fast was undertaken by me not as a Congressman but as a man. I observed a certain religion and I fasted in accordance with its doctrine. I said the same thing to Hakim Ajmal Khan as regards the fast connected with Hindu-Muslim tension. Now too it is for me a religious and not a political question.”

 [Answering Mahadev Desai, Gandhiji said] : “. . . The suppressed classes are in great peril today. The pity of it is that no one else is aware of it. It may be that when I am released, the situation might have deteriorated to such an extent that it cannot be retrieved. Numerous untouchables might have been converted to Islam or else the caste Hindus might have crushed them into submission. This part of the British Government’s decision seems so dangerous to me that even if all other parts had been acceptable, I would have been compelled to take such a  step in  order to  combat it. ”
