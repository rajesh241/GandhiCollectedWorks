libtech_448_footnote,"1Here The Bombay Chronicle, 16-1-1922, has: “Mahatmaji mentioned a long list of Government’s sins of omission and commission which had made the situation what it was today, which was worse than that under martial law. And he mentioned, as  an illustration, the case of Sitamarhi in Bihar which had been saddled with punitive police. He asked the Conference if they realized what the stationing of punitive police meant, and as long as such things were happening in the country by the express sanction of Government, the talk of a conference must be futile. Continuing, he regretfully acknowledged that some non-co-operators had been guilty violence and he apologized to them all for such conduct. But barring such incidents which were few and far between, the progress made by the non-co-operation movement was quite satisfactory and he had no reason to be disappointed with the results already achieved. As regards the suffering voluntarily and cheerfully borne by his co-workers, Mahatmaji pointed out that not one of the sufferers had ever complained. There was Maulana Shaukat Ali who had lost 30 Ibs. in weight during his incarceration but he had wanted to reduce his weight. Dr. Kitchlew wanted to gain in weight and he had gained, while Pandit Motilal Nehru had found the rest in jail which he had vainly looked for when free. As for Lala Lajpat Rai he was using his time in writing a text-book for national schools. So that, said Mahatma Gandhi, who adroitly gave a humorous turn to this portion of his speech, they had no reason to regret it at all."
