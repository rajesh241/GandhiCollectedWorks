  	I have gone through the whole thing. Here the question is one of 	principle. I am sure that an intellectual can do better  than  an 	artisan.

 March 5, 1945libtech_12_footnote
 When asked by the representative of the Orient Press on what he had to say about the recent warning given to local Congress workers by the District Magistrate, Nagpur,libtech_13_footnoteGandhiji said:
 Congressmen who have associated for the fulfilment of our constructive programme need not be agitated over what local governments say or do. Whether their policy is merely local or represents the Centre, they should learn to shed fear.
 The District Magistrate’s strictures if they are properly reported are undoubtedly revealing. They need not alarm us.
 In reply to another question as to how without any political action and only by social and economic improvement the country could reach its destined goal as revealed by him in his statement published on 20th February,libtech_14_footnotelibtech_15_footnoteGandhiji replied:
 I must refer you to my statement and you may ask yourself whether, if the programme is universally responded to, it will not lead to swaraj. Indeed the Muslim League and even the  Government  should join in its prosecution if they are honest about independence.
 When asked what he thought about anti-Indian propaganda carried on in America by Britishers Gandhiji replied:
Anti-Indian British propaganda should not matter if we are
truthful.

16,"March 	6, 1945",LETTER TO MUNNALAL G. SHAH,"
          CHI. 	MU.,     March 	6, 1945    	Why need  you  feel   embarrassed?  This   problem  cannot be 
  	solved in that way. Ask me any question you wish without the 	slightest hesitation. My statement has undergone some revision and 	may undergo more. I don’t wish to exclude anybody. I have 	mentioned four. Perhaps they will say, “We were not objects of 	your experiment; we slept with you as with a mother.” I would not 	contradict them. It is enough here to mention that such a thing has 	happened. I don’t consider Abha, Kanchan and Vina as part of the 	experiment. If we distinguish between sleeping together and the 	experiment, the difference between the two in my view is a big one. 	Abha slept with me for hardly three nights. Kanchan slept one night 	only. Vina’s sleeping with me might be called an accident. All 	that can be said is that she slept close to me. If Abha had 	continued, her case would have been and altogether different one. 	Kanchan’s case was rather tragic. I didn’t understand her at 	all. What Abha or Kanchan told me was this; that she had no 	intention whatever of observing brahmacharya, butwished to 	enjoy the pleasure of sex. She, therefore, stayed only reluctantly 	and undressed only for fear of hurting me. If I remember rightly, 	she was not with me even for an hour. I then stopped both the women 	sleeping with me, for I realized that Kanu and you were upset. I 	myself advised them that they should tell you both and  also  	Bhansali. You will thus see that these three names cannot be 	included in the experiment. Lilavati, Amtussalaam, Rajkumari and 	Prabhavati are not here. I have deliberately included Pra. in the 	experiment. Maybe I should not. She often used to sleep with me to 	keep me warm even before I was conscious that I was making an 	experiment. I used to draw her to me when she lay on the floor, 	shivering, for my sake. This is an old, old story. I think I have 	now told you everything. If you have any more questions, you may ask 	me. Kanchan’s labouring under a misunderstanding pained me, but I 	was helpless.  	I formed no judgment regarding Sushila and you. I did not get 	sufficient material, for doing that either. If she herself wishes 	and you too wish it, I would spare some time and hear you both. I 	will examine witnesses and try to weigh the evidence. But let me 	repeat that if you 
 two feel as brother and sister to each other, you should not ask even your father to examine you and pronounce judgment. But do as you wish.
 I understand about a separate kitchen. I shall try. Will the purchase of provisions for the hospital and the Ashram kitchens be under one account or two? I see that a catering service can be run only if it is managed by a third party. I think this is enough for today. About the third party and going to villages, etc., later on. I have not revised this. If you feel that anything needs correction, ask me.

G. SHAHlibtech_18_footnote","
  
 March 6, 1945 This discussion is somewhat out of place because at present nothing is happening. For this too friends are responsible. I have gone
as far as I could to satisfy them. It will not be proper for me to do
 anything until I have satisfied my co-workers. I am as much against compromise as I am for it. For this very reason my elder brother remained my enemy for 13 years. He asked my forgiveness five or six months before his death. My caste also became my enemy in the same manner. Now it does not show any feeling of animosity. But quite a few sanatanists are still opposed to me. On this account I let myself be deprived of lakhs of rupees. I used to be a friend of the Empire. Today I have become its enemy. What more need I say? I showed the door to a wife like Ba. Thus, I am what I am. There is therefore no point in talking about the welfare of society. What else may I give up? I cannot give up thinking. As far as possible I have postponed the practice of sleeping together. But it cannot be given up altogether. You can say that ever since I went to England I have been pursuing the idea of brahmacharya. It has not harmed anyone. It is true of course that I should do what others too can be permitted to do. If I can restrain myself and sleep beside a woman, others can also do so on the same condition. They can fulfil that condition if they so wish.
 The same applies to non-violence. If I completely give up sleeping together, my brahmacharya will be put to shame. It is not that I would do anything for the mere pleasure of it. I have not done it
 
 for years, and I shall not do it now. It is true that people may indulge in licentiousness by imitating me. Who can stop it? Is there any place where   asatyagrahalibtech_19_footnotelibtech_20_footnotehas   never   been   practised   in   the   name   of satyagraha? In any case, the thing has been postponed because it calls for consideration. But since there is need for a halt let it be so. You can ask any questions. I suggest that you should not ask questions individually.You may all discuss it among yourselves and then ask questions. Let it be understood that right now  everything is postponed. Manu has been left alone by the others. Hence there is scope for a mature deliberation. I claim that whatever I have done I have done in the name of God. I go to bed reciting His name. I have got up with His name on my lips. So it is in my dreams, whether alone or with some woman. What God will make me do in days to come He alone knows.
 Such restrictions should not be imosed on me. Kishorelalbhai’s business should be left to him. Do not drag him into this matter. My advice is that everybody should join hands and stand by him. There is no need to plead his case before me. I am glad that I have answered your question but I am not in a position to listen.
 I have said that right now everything stands postponed, leaving aside Manu. But Kishorelal is not satisfied with this. It is your duty to understand him. He is right when he says: “I was not consulted at first. Now I shall not create any confusion.” In the present situation whoever has any doubt in his mind should follow him. I would in any case do that. I would not create difficulties for him. You should consider his delicate health when you bother him. If you do this you will be serving him, no doubt, but you will also be serving me. My love for him is certainly no less than my love for my brother. What more can I do?

20,"March 7, 1945","FOREWORD TO “GANDHIJI’S CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE
	GOVERNMENT”","
  
 I have read the introduction as also the originals. The introduction may be good enough for the hasty reader, but the publication is not designed for the hasty reader. It is designed for the
 
 serious worker who can affect the politics of his country and even the world affairs. To such my advice is that he must read the originals. The introduction may be used as such and as an aid to memory. I want the readers I have in view to take me at my word. I have written as I felt at the moment as a seeker of long standing of Truth and Non-violence. I have written without reservation and without embellishment.
 After my accidentally premature discharge from detentionlibtech_21_footnotelibtech_22_footnoteand convalescence I studied from reliable witnesses the happenings of the two years after the incarceration of principal Congressmen  and myself. I have heard nothing to modify the opinion expressed in my writings under review.
 I know first hand what has happened, since my discharge, in the various spheres of life. And I have found bitter confirmation of what I have said in the following pages. Indeed, the whole of India is a vast prison. The Viceroy is the irresponsible superintendent of the prison with numerous jailers and warders under him. The four hundred millions of India are not the only prisoners. There are others similarly situated in the other parts of the earth under other superintendents.
 A jailer is as much a prisoner as his prisoner. There is no doubt  a difference. From my point of view he is worse. If there is a Day of Judgment, i.e., if there is a Judge whom we do not see but who nevertheless is much more truly than we exist for a brief moment, the judgment will go hard against the Jailer and in favour of the prisoners.
 India is the only place on earth which knowingly has chosen Truth and Non-violence as the only means for her deliverance. But deliverance to be obtained through these means must be deliverance for the whole world including the jailers otherwise described by me as tyrants and imperialists. I need not mention Fascists or Nazis or Japanese. They seem to be as good as gone.
 The war will end this year or the next. It will bring victory to the Allies. The pity of it is that it will be only so-called if it is attained with India and the like lying prostrate at the feet of the Allies. That victory will be assuredly a prelude to a deadlier war, if anything could be more deadly.
 I know that I do not need to plead for non-violent India. If India has the coin with Truth on one face and Non-violence on the
 
 other, the coin has its own inestimable value which will speak for itself. Truth and Non-violence must express humility at every step. They do not disdain real aid from any quarter, much less from those in whose name and for whom exploitation is practised. If the British and the Allies aid, so much the better. Deliverance will then come sooner. If they do not, deliverance is still certain. Only the agony of the victim will be greater, the time longer. But what are agony and time if theyare spent in favour of liberty, especially when it is to be brought about through Truth and Non-violence!

 Bhai Jhaverbhai has ever been undertaking new studies and adding to his store of useful knowledge. He easily finds use for this increased knowledge in disseminating it. He thinks in his  own  language or the national language, so that his ideas are understood by thousands with the utmost ease. If he carries on in this manner, the knowledge he has gained will soon become common possession.
 Bhai Jhaverbhai has written a beautiful essay and given information about food, etc., in simple language. I hope that the knowledge will be widely used and the suggestions made in the essay implemented. The author’s aim is to impart knowledge so that it will be put to use and not merely add to learning.

 CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,
 There is no discourtesy in your question. Your question shows how imperfect a medium language is.
 If I stop sleeping together for all time it will mean that I have been mistaken. Otherwise why should I stop it? There is a limit toabstaining from it for the sake of friends. Sleeping together came with my taking up of brahmacharya or even before that. Can you understand it now?
 The dangers you have pointed out are certainly there. But for that reason, a good act should not be avoided. Only we should be vigilant.
 The experiment is not meant to be imitated. But if I can become  a perfect brahmachari thereby, would I not be able to contribute more to the welfare of the world? Even if there is a single person who can train himself that way, he should do it. I was not out for  an experiment, but when the situation presented itself before me I did what I felt was necessary."

 SEVAGRAM,
 March 9, 1945libtech_47_footnote
  Q. 	At present there 	are only provincial 	Congress organizations 	functioning. Is 	it not essential to 	have an all-India  Congress 	 organization  to 	enunciate a 	common policy and 	common programme? 
A.	A	common	all-India	Congress	organization	is	an
 impossibility while the President and other members of the Working Committee are in detention.
  Q. 	What is 	the definition 	of a 	kisan? 	We hope 	that you agree that we 	can have 	an independent 	Andhra Provincial 	Kisan Congress 	as a 	part of 	and under 	the discipline 	of the Andhra 	Province Congress Assembly [sic]? 
A. For me a kisan is one who actually works on land belonging
 to himself or another. In every case, I have pointed the way of relief. You should read what  I  have  written.libtech_48_footnotelibtech_49_footnoteLocal  difficulties  should  be solved locally. For the right answer, accurate knowledge of local conditions is necessary. I lack this. Hence my answer may even mislead. All organizations may be independent and yet a part of the Congress and subject to its discipline.
  Q. 	We think 	it is better 	to have 	for the Kisan Congress 	also a 	tricoloured national 	flag without any 	additional class emblem. 
A. I had full discussion with  Prof.  Ranga.libtech_50_footnotelibtech_51_footnoteI  agree  generally
about the points you have raised.
  Q. 	There are many kisans 	in villages 	who have helped 	in war 	efforts under 	the official 	influence. They are not 	entitled to 	be members of the Congress 	organizations at 	present. But 	they are, all 	the same, sympathizers 	of the 	National Congress. 	Shall we 	bring them into Kisan 	Congress? Both 	classes of 	members can 	have equal 	voice in the 	matter of 	redress against the 	landlords and 	the Government. But the first class of members only should decide all questions of a political nature. 
A. Those who are real sympathizers will remain so even if for
 
 technical reasons today they may not join you. By all means take them if you so wish.
 The Deputation asked Gandhiji whether Congress could see local officials in grave and emergent cases of food and other economic difficulties of people for immediate redress and Gandhiji replied that it was not an absolute evil to see officials but there should be no seeing to flatter or please them.
 Asked as to whether Congress bodies could apply to officials for permission to hold public meetings, processions or training camps, in any district where prohibitory order by the District Magistrate is in force, Gandhiji replied that no such permission should be applied for.
 Winding up the discussion, Mahatmaji said that generally while he made himself available to all friends, they should try to act on their own even though they may make mistakes.

  	A conference of Congress workers, limited in number and by special 	invitation, was recently banned in Akola by the District Magistrate. 	The order is reported to say that “discussion will take      
 place among other subjects on the work and programme  of the Congress, particularly in villages”. Considering the influence of the invitees, he was of the opinion that this conference would “hamper the successful prosecution of the war”. It passes comprehension how a conference, where only discussion could take place, can hamper the prosecution of the war or how the constructive programme, no matter how influentially worked, can hamper the prosecution of  the  war. Does the Magistrate say one thing and mean something else when he says that a successful working of the constructive programme can and will make the present war with the Japanese impossible? This may need proof, but no proof is needed to show that the constructive work cannot and is not designed to hamper in any way whatsoever the prosecution of the war. What it can do is to bring work and bread to villagers in their own homes, besides making illiterates literate and happy. Or does Government, if the order is prompted by them, want to prevent influential Congressmen from serving the people in any way whatsoever? If so, why have they released Congressmen at all? Anyway Congressmen whose only calling is service of the people will serve mutely and without caring for the consequences that may befall them by reason of their service. That is the true meaning of do or die.

If, 	nevertheless, you insist on an impartial judgment, I am ready to 	hand over all the  papers  to  Narahari. Let him go through them and 	give his verdict.  	Is not your advice to me futile? In practice there is nothing now. 	As for the thought, how can I change it so long as I feel that it is 	pure?  Blessings from  BAPU  From a photostat of the Gujarati: C.W. 5847.

 CHI. MUNNALAL,
 I can find the time, but it seems pointless. Since you want it I give my decision. Both of you are hasty. Both of you  first  say whatever occurs to you and think afterwards. If Sushila had not intervened that evening, the outcome would have been quite different. But she is unable to restrain herself. Moreover, she believes she cannot hurt you since you are more than a brother to her. There is nothing more left for me to say. What has happened has happened. Sushila could not have removed Chand to quarters reserved for other people, and she assumed that since she had come with a suggestion about the sick, you would readily offer your room. The thing is we ought to have special facilities for the sick, which we have not provided. It will be enough if we take a lesson for the future from this incident. Say to yourself again and again: “Think before you speak.” As far as possible one must cultivate silence. And even if we have to work very hard for it, we must have a separate room for the sick. Like a fire bucket, it must not be put to any other use. Sushila’s statement is attached, as also yours. I have not shown her this letter, nor your statement.

It is not any more necessary that things should be explained to the public at large in the way it can understand. But I am not applying this to you. Yashodhara is very sensible. She could have asked me. But it is amazing how hesitant women are. I shall not issue my statement right now. I have a telegram from Mathuradas. I made my decision only on that basis. Now I have your letter. So the matter is ended. The sin or merit of the postponement will be divided between you two. If it is merit, would I also not have my share ? From my point of view, I have done nothing wrong. When I came to know, I shall proclaim it from the house-tops. Do not be upset. I am what I have always been.

 Why have you sent a friend all the way from Assam when you have my advice in your pocket ? I repeat—do what you think is best cost what it may. Kill the corruption. Adopt that alternative which is best under the circumstances. Keep all clean men and parties together. I know that difficulties will be many but to cut our way through them makes us.

 March 17, 1945
 CHI. BALVANT SINHA,
 Knowing you as I do I can say from your remarks that at least for some time you must leave Sevagram. Write a sweet letter to Totaramji. I see no need of your going there. The same goes for Surendraji. But you may go to your own village. Or, to Mirabehn or perhaps to Manzar Ali. In any of these three places you will do at least something. Yes, Bengal is a vast field for your goseva work. But now that is out.
 Now about Sevagram. It is my belief that Sevagram will never break up. It may undergo transformation, as was the case with Sabarmati. As long as I am alive and active, there will not be much change at Sevagram. I do not wish to make any. If I survive, a new order will come in course of time. Those who are attached  to Sevagram will not give it up for good either now or after I am gone. Who can say that after I am dead even Vinoba may not possibly make the place his own? If he survives me, his loyalty and his non-violence will not permit him to leave Sevagram.
 I am sure that even though all  the  organizations  are independent, they are unknowingly dependent on Sevagram. This is just as well.
 When you become meek like a she-goat, you will again come to like Sevagram as you did in the beginning. What does it matter if today the cow has been taken away from you? At least you have not been taken away from the cow? What does it matter if today you and Munnalal do not feel one as before?
 I am not saying all this in order to make you change your mind. My advice to you stays. Go where I have suggested. After that you may come here when you feel the urge.
What more can I say?

 Do what pleases Asha Devi. That alone will please me. It would not be proper to give up the work of Nayee Talim having once taken it up. Still, it is for you to consider.

  	You form opinions on incomplete information and  feel unhappy. This 	has been your old habit. You must get rid of it. What wrong notions 	you have formed on the basis of Su[shila]behn’s letter  	! I am not a person to waste myself physically and mentally. I do my 	work and am happy. I put my idea of education into practice in my 	own case. My fast—it could not really be called a fast because I 	took fruit juice—was purely physical. I did not find it 	unbearable. I did not agree to take glucose and so had the feeling 	of fasting. But that was only for a short time, as later on I had to 	take glucose. I can tell you more but this should suffice. Bear in 	mind that I take all possible care of myself. I hope Kanam is well. 	He wrote to me that he would be coming to Bombay but would be able 	to do so only after hisexaminations. I do not know whether I shall 	be there then. We shall see. I hope Ushi has recovered.

 Has it not been proved that in your case proximity to me does not help in observing brahmacharya? Otherwise, after so many years, your brahmacharya should have been perfect. It is necessary for the sake of brahmacharya that one should engage oneself in ennobling work. Nayee Talim is one such work and when children are there what more can you ask? If you stay with the children instead of being here, you will not lose contact with me and you will be kept away from idle talk."

  	Your long letter betrays your state of mind. Is it not right that I 	should write to you taking what you say to be the complete truth? 	The others who are here do not feel very intensely about 	brahmacharya. You do and so I write about it. But in 	the end you must do as you feel. If you do something I say without 	your heart being in it, you may take it that it will be futile. It 	will be no good at all if  you  mechanically do what I say.

         March 	20, 1945  CHI. 	MUNNALAL,  	I have read all that you have written. Give up the notion that I 	have no trust in you. That you are unmethodical is shown by your 	writing and your behaviour. What can you do about it? First the 	realization, then the endeavour, then the time. That is the order.  	I do wish that there should be a separate kitchen. I am considering 	what to do now. I will write nothing now about Sushila. There was no 	question of my selecting anybody for my office. I employ in it only 	those whom I cannot fix up anywhere else. Others who joined did so 	by accident. If I had to start a new office altogether,  I should 	know very well how to do it. You do not know with what type of 	persons I have run an office in the most difficult circumstances. 	But can I not run the Ashram also in that manner? Why did I not 	appoint Vinoba to run the office? You should be able to draw the 	appropriate conclusions from this. If when I have some free time you 	ask me for work, I will tell you. Do you really feel like doing some 	work in the office?  	Personally I should like to return from Bombay in about four days’ 	time. But I shall be in the doctors’ hands. Maybe I shall have to 	go to Panchgani if they insist. I don’t know. We shall see  what 	happens.  	I do not say, or wish, that you should go to Kanchan. But if she or 	you feel such a desire, I would encourage you. If you tell me your 
 reasons for not going, or write them down, I might consider. I have to be away for two months. In that time there is a chance that the kitchenarrangements may improve. I am not satisfied with this letter. The circumstances themselves are unsatisfactory. Whom can we blame for that?

  	I have your letter. What a narrow escape you have had!libtech_105_footnoteI hope Lavanyalata is doing well. Kanchan’s postcard 	to Munnalal came today. I see from it that she is very ill. Why? I 	am asking Munnalal to go there. Let us see what happens. I am all 	right. I am working regularly. I shall have to go to Bombay towards 	the end of this month.

BALVANT SINHA,  	There is no need to think about your state of mind. It seems to me 	that you should go to your village. Go to Mirabehn and also to 	Dharmadev Shastri. Staying away at this time can only do you good. 	No doubt the Ashram remains full because of me, but it has proved 	its independent existence during my absence, be it here, at 	Sabarmati, at Kochrab or at Phoenix. The Autobiography gives 	the story up to Sabarmati. It is astonishing. Ask somebody or ask 	me. It is good to learn veterinary science. There is no hurry.

  	I have sent you an express telegramlibtech_106_footnote, 	a copy of which is enclosed. What are you taking, how much and when? 	What leafy vegetables are you taking, and are you taking them raw or 	boiled? You do not throw away the water, do you? Will not khakharalibtech_107_footnotebe better than toast? Does the Hour include the bran? 	If you are taking milk, how much? Whatever happens you must take 	half an ounce of butter well spread over the toast or khakhara, 	together with the salad. If you have indigestion, reduce other 	things, but continue the butter. Deep breathing is essential. Close 	one nostril and breathe deeply through the other. You can gradually 	increase it to half an hour. Utter Ramanama with every breath you 	take. When doing breathing exercises, you should have fresh air on 	all sides. It would be better to do it in the open. You should do it 	every morning without fail and afterwards at least four times after 	the food has been digested. Breathe in and breathe out. This 	exercise should be taken slowly. Do your bowels move properly? Are 	you able to sleep? If you do all this carefully you will soon get 	rid of the cough.

  	I do have news of you. Pyarelal also gave me some. It is good that 	you are in Harijan Nivas. You must get well. Chand is somewhat 	agitated. She has received so much from you. Must she not now serve      
 you? The thought is noble. If you need Chand’s services, I will send her immediately. She is learning to nurse the sick here. But nursing you will be the proper training. However, if you do not need Chand’s services, then I do not see any point in sending her merely so that you can look at each other. Let me know your mind.
 Khurshedbehn left a few days ago. She is in Poona with Nargisbehn.
 The heat has started here. I do not therefore have the courage to send for you.

148,"March 	20, 1945",INTERVIEW TO “THE BOMBAY CHRONICLE”,"
         SEVAGRAM,  March 	20, 1945 	[Q.] 	Mr. Amerylibtech_113_footnotetold 	Karaka, Bombay 	Chronicle’s war 	correspondent, in 	the course of 	an interview, 	that you could 	give a 	lead. He 	stated that 	you had spoken for 	the Congress party before. In the context the suggestion seems to be that you candeal         
 through Congress members in the legislatures. What are your views on these suggestions? In view of the statement made by Mr. Amery that “the Government Of India would no doubt need also to be satisfied that nothing would be done to impede or injure war efforts by direct opposition or by attempts to dislocate the economic situation”, will you be pleased to make things absolutely clear on the point?
[A.]libtech_114_footnoteWish is often father to the thought. I see nothing new in
 Mr. Amery’s statement to Shri Karaka. All talk of resolution of the present deadlock is useless so long as the members of the Working Committee and other Congressmen are under detention. Obstruction of war effort is a mere bogey. But if it means that there will be fierce criticism of the bungling and corruption that has gone on in the name of war effort it is true—not that there is no criticism now. When the principal Congressmen are free there will be real national war effort if they are allowed to have an effective say.

150,"March 21, 1945",FOREWORD TO “PRACTICE AND PRECEPTS OF JESUS”,"
    
 Hating carefully gone through these chapters, I can recommend their carefullibtech_117_footnoteperusal to every believer in God be he a Christian or a follower of any other religion.
 The booklet presents Professor J. C. Kumarappa’s views on Christian teaching in a nutshell. It is a revolutionary view of Jesus as a man of God. It is none the less revealing and interesting. The interpretation of the Lord’s prayer is novel and refreshing as  are many other interpretations.
 If all believe as Prof. Kumarappa does there will be no religious feuds and rivalries between sects and sects and different religions. Anyway, this reading of the Bible must bring solace to the Christians of India. If they will read the Bible as Prof. K. does, they need not be ashamedlibtech_118_footnoteof their forefathers or their ancient faith. What is bad and superstitious in the old they are able to throw off by means of the liberal teaching presented in the following pages but it helps one to see that there is much of the old which is imperishable and worthy of being treasured.
 Indeed, Prof. K. has a message beyond the confines of India. He speaks with confidence born of a living faith in the belief that the West, though nominally Christian, has not known the true Jesus of the Gospels.
 As I was going through these pages, I was reminded of the late Advocate F. A. Laughton of Durban. I was then no student of Roman Or Dutch Law nor of the case law of the four States of South Africa. In difficulty, therefore, I used to go to Mr. Laughton for help. But, after I had done with my work, he would proudly bring forth from his drawer a green cover book with his father’s annotations from the Bible. It was Edwin Arnold’s Song Celestial, and had Mr. Laughton’s father’s parallel passages from the Bible showing that there was much in common between the New Testament and the Gita. I was then a novice trying to find out Truth in all its aspects without then knowing that I was so doing. Prof. Kumarappa’s interpretation with copious quotations from the Bible reminded me of what I used to believe even
 
 as early as 1894-95. I can therefore speak from experience of thetruth of the interpretation of the Gospels given in the following pages by Prof. Kumarappa.

 CHI. MUNNALAL,
 You should never conclude from anything that I write that I must have examined every aspect. That is for you readers to do. I would of course relieve you and put up with whatever hardship follows. But the truth is that you ought not to abandon the work you have taken up. Man may not abandon his duty any more than the ant can abandon the pot of jaggery. We, however, look upon duty not as a pot of jaggery but as a burden. Otherwise how dare A. S. so much as suggest that you should leave? But that is what happened. I like what you say. By all means cling to the kitchen and make it a model one. It will bring you all the joy and you will get training along with the others. The gods will shower flowers and it may be I shall be there to watch. Make it an ideal kitchen. Run it with the help of servants, so called, but let them feel that they are not servants but masters or trustees. What more could you desire?
 You now know my ideas fully. Forget Kanchan if possible. Write to her plainly that you are to get tempered here and she there. After both of you have become tempered, you will meet again. If you can do this, you will have brought down many fruits with one stone. The saying is about killing many birds with one stone. That is a wrong one, ours is the right one.

186,"March 24, 1945",SPEECH AT A. I. S. A. MEETING-Ilibtech_138_footnote,"
          SEVAGRAM, 
  March 24, 1945 I regret I shall not be 	able to be present throughout the entire proceedings. The reason is 	that I wish to live for 125 years, so that I can 	serve the country longer. I was not joking when I said so at the  	August meeting of A. I. C. C., for a satyagrahi never utters a word 	that he does not mean. I earnestly endeavour to fulfil this wish of 	mine and to this end I try to conserve as much of my energy as I 	can.  	Whether I succeed in my desire to live to 125 years will not depend 	on doctors or medical science, though in my own way I have used the 	aid of both a good deal. It will depend on my ability fully to 	translate into practice the principles of truth and ahimsa. My 	experience of ahimsa has taught me that even in the work of service 	the pace should not be too fast. I confess that in this I have been 	only partially successful. I cannot regulate my pace sufficiently.  	Old,  settled habits are not overcome all at once. I know undue 	haste is bad; it impedes work instead of facilitating it.  	I have been asked whether it is desirable to mix politics and 	constructive work. At present some people are doing constructive 	workin order to strengthen the Congress organization. This mixing of   
    it 	up?”     
  A. 	I. S. A., was held in the Khadi Vidyalaya Hall. 
 politics and constructive work helps neither. I entirely concur with the view that for full justice to be done to constructive work it must stand on its own feet and should not be tied to political work. I fear this advice of mine will not have any effect. But as the author of the Mahabharata says, ‘You must continue to proclaim the truth irrespective of whether anybody listens to you or not.’ This comforts me.
 Since I first presented through the Congress the constructive programme to the country in 1920, my faith in its  efficacy  has  become stronger. In the light of experience and knowledge gained, its scope has been enlarged. It is my claim, and I have proclaimed it from the house-tops, that my 15-point programme is comprehensive and if it is pursued throughout the country we shall gain swaraj without any other programme.
 Mahatma Gandhi referred to the formation of the Congress Ministry in the North-West Frontier Province and the reported efforts of Mr. Bhulabhai Desai to end the political deadlock and said:libtech_139_footnote
 I prefer to keep silent on these points for the present. The Parliamentary programme  may result in political swaraj; but non-violent swaraj is possible only by fully implementing the constructive programme.
 If only the constructive programme was worked in the right spirit, there was no need either to incur the wrath of the ruling race or even to enter the Legislatures. But Gandhiji urged that even if parliamentary work was permitted, the special importance of the constructive programme would always remain and through it alone the freedom of the country could be achieved.
It may be asked whether the people will take up the constructive
 programme and pursue it in the way I want it pursued. My answer is that whether they do so or not does not take away from the merit of the remedy I advocate which is both good and practicable.
 In this connection I have been asked whether, since carrying on of the movement against untouchability and organizing of peasants and workers in the name of the Congress provides a chance to Ambedkar and others to raise opposition and thus impede anti- untouchability work, it would not be better if these programmes were pursued independently of the Congress.
It is my view that if the followers of Ambedkar oppose us we
 
 should not let ourselves be provoked or give up our work because of it. We should reach their hearts and understand their feelings. If we had gone through the experiences that the Harijans  have  gone through, there is no telling how embittered we might not have become and how little our ahimsa would have endured. Therefore on such occasions we should look inward and if there is the slightest vestige of untouchability left we should purge ourselves of it. It is my firm belief that if Hinduism is to survive, untouchability must go. If untouchability lives, Hinduism is bound to perish and will deserve to perish. The tragedy is that those who should have especially devoted themselves to the work of reform did not put their hearts into the thing and only played with it. What wonder that Harijan brethren feel suspicious, and show opposition and bitterness?
 The removal of untouchability root and branch thus becomes a religious duty for me and for other Hindus like me. If we want to achieve swaraj through non-violence then untouchability will have to be eradicated. We cannot attain swaraj without that. Not all Congressmen share this view of mine. The Cangress is a democratic organization and it can have in it people representing many points of view. No one has the right to thrust his own view on others and expect them to work in pursuance of those views. It will be right if those who consider eradication of untouchability a religious duty  give  themselves up exclusively to this work with single-minded devotion. At the same time it will also be right if those who consider anti-untouchability work as a part of the political programme of the Congress pursue it as such.
 Religious duty is a very subtle and complicated thing. It is not a commodity that can be bought and sold. Perpetual inner searching is needed in order to discover it. In essence it is the same for all times and all places but its form and its translation into practice changes from individual to individual and from time to time. If we can but grasp this secret of the many-sidedness of truth we shall be able to see any differences between principles and practice in their proper perspective. I therefore welcome both those who work for the eradication of untouchability independently and those who do so in pursuance of the Congress programme.libtech_140_footnote
 The same argument, he said, applied to the question whether Congressmen
 
 
 could organize the kisans and workers. Congressmen could not do it and yet remainCongressmen. He said he had already informed Mr. N. G. Ranga that it would lead to conflict if there was a separate organization for peasants and workers and consequent weakening of both the organizations.
 He himself had ceased to be a four-anna member of the Congress and yet he claimed that he was rendering more service to the Congress by remaining outside. Everyone could do like him but no one had the right to lay down the rule for others or expect them to fall into line with himself. To find fault with those whose angle of approach to constructive work was different would be like cutting the very tree on which they were sitting.libtech_141_footnote
 Gandhiji concluded the first set of questions by repeating what he had often said before that he was there merely to advise. No one was bound to accept his advice unless it appealed to his head and heart.
The other question asked is whether the funds of the Charkha
 Sangh can be used for giving training to khadi workers in other branches of constructive work, such as agriculture, animal husbandry and Nayee Talim, in order to equip them for allround village service. My answer is no. Funds collected for one institution cannot be spent on another. According to the constitution of the Charkha Sangh its funds cannot be used for any purpose other than khadi. Therefore expenditure on training in agriculture and animal husbandry should be borne by the institution concerned. Otherwise it will lead to confusion. If money belonging to one institution has to be advanced as loan to another institution, it should be done on proper security and on a reasonable rate of interest. The job of a trustee is difficult and dedicate. I have been atrustee of various institutions for over fifty years and every institution under me has flourished. The secret of my success is not my Mahatmaship but my business sense and the meticulous care I show in maintaining accounts. The success or otherwise of a public institution ought not to depend on the brilliance of an individual or individuals but on the purity of its management and the soundness of its business policy. If you cultivate these money will come to you of itself.
 A friend has suggested that khadi work instead of being carried on through the various branches of the Charkha Sangh should, within a specified time, be entrusted to workers engaged in all-round village work who understand the scheme. I agree with the suggestion, but I am not in favour of laying down a time-limit for winding up all khadi production activity. I am however very keen that all the khadi
 
 consumed in the villages should be produced in the villages by thevillagers themselves. That will eliminate all incidental and overhead charges and put khadi beyond commercial competition. This is the work which can very effectively be done through Nayee Talim. Nayee Talim is all-embracing in its scope. That means it has to be like a magnet that attracts all, young and old.
 So long as it does not develop this power it will be a body without soul.
 If the Charkha Sangh is to free itself of the burden it carries, workers of the type needed will have to be produced. These are  lacking at present. I therefore want that none of you should leave Sevagram till you have understood the principles of Nayee Talim.
 I am as impatient as any of you to reach our goal but I realize that the task is an uphill one. India has been enslaved for so long—its slavery dates since even before British rule—that all initiative and originality in us has been killed and we are paralyzed with despair. Constructive work cannot make headway without a resuscitation of these lost qualities in us, and the attainment of independence through truth and non-violence must remain an empty dream unless constructive work can be carried through to success.  Freedom  is bound to come. It is coming. But mere political freedom will not satisfy me. It will certainly not satisfy the world which expects much greater things from India. Independence of my conception means nothing less than the realization of the “Kingdom of God within you and on this earth’’.libtech_142_footnoteI would rather work for and die in the pursuit of this dream though it may never be realized. That means infinite patience and perseverance. If India is satisfied with the mere attainment of political independence and there is nothing better for me to do, you will find me retiring to the Himalayas leaving those who wish to listen to me to seek me out there.
 Gandhiji then offered to answer the remaining questions the next daylibtech_143_footnoteand before winding up his talk for the day he said that they need not be disheartened at the present state of the country. He was happy that with infinite patience they had achieved something in spite of their slavery and other obstacles, and he was really proud of the achievement.

 South Africa has lost a most generous-minded citizen and the Indians of that subcontinent a very warm friend.
 In Hermann Kallenbach’s death I have lost a very dear and near friend. He used to say to me often that when I was deserted by the whole world, I would find him to be a true friend going with me, if need be, to the ends of the earth in search of Truth. He used to spend at one time £75 per month on his person alone. But he so revolutionized his life that his monthly personal expenses amounted to under £8. This lasted while we lived together in a cottage seven miles from Johannesburg. When I left South Africa, he reverted in large part to his original life though mostly eschewing the things of life he had deliberately left.
 He came in close touch with the late patriot Mr. G. K. Gokhale, who held him in high esteem. It may be noted that together with Henry Polak, Mr. H. Kallenbach was arrested for marching with me from Natal to Transvaallibtech_145_footnote.

           SEVAGRAM, 
  March 	25, 1945  	Jajuji says that the quantity of yarn tendered in partial payment 	for khadi should be increased from two pice to 2_ as., or a hank of 	yarn per rupee. This is too mild. I would go further. Some days back 	Bombay had become the Manchester of khadi. Khadi was brought from 	far and wide and sold there. The credit for this went to the 	salesmanship of Shri Vithaldas Jerajani. It was thanks to his 	efforts that first swadeshi goods and then khadi entered Bombay. But 	now I see that that was not the light way. Khadi, in the first 	place, should be consumed where it is produced. If in a particular 	place khadi in excess of the requirement is produced the surplus 	should be sent to the nearest place where it is needed. The district 	should be the limit or at most the province. Indeed I would not go 	even as far as the province. A district is a large enough area for 	this sort of transaction. The aim of course is that the khadi 	produced in a village should be sold in that village. But out of the 	seven lakh villages in India how many are there which can make this 	claim about themselves? In the villages where khadi is produced the 	spinners and weavers, for all the efforts of the Charkha Sangh, use 	very little of the khadi they produce. This is against the ideal of 	khadi. The condition of two pice per rupee to be tendered in yarn 	for the purchase of khadi does not apply to villagers. They must 	sell khadi only in exchange of yarn. Do you fear that if you enforce 	the yarn condition the sale of khadi in cities will suffer? If you 	do not get rid of this fear you will kill khadi.libtech_149_footnote  	The rule of giving half an anna worth of yarn for one rupee of khadi 	purchased is generally meant for big cities and I would desire that 	all should spin and produce their khadi. Khadi is the emblem oftruth 	and non-violence. Such exchange of yarn may result in reducing the 	number of khadi wearers but we should carry on our work in that 	direction and ultimately we shall succeed.  	Khadi has won a place of honour in society. The rich feel proud of 	buying khadi produced by the poor. But this is not enough. If you 	limit the role of khadi to providing bread to the poor, it cannot be 	an    
 instrument for securing swaraj through non-violence. I do not want this. Even if I were the only one left to buy khadi on condition of yarn being tendered I should not worry. You have accepted khadi as the symbol of non-violence. You have also accepted it as the means for securing swaraj. If it is the will of God that khadi should die I would rather it died a natural death than that your timidity and lack of faith should be the cause of its demise. Those who for some reason cannot themselves spin can get their wives, mothers, sisters or servants to spin. Failing that they may get yarn from their neighbours but not on payment.libtech_150_footnote
 Next he produced some figureslibtech_151_footnotewhich Shri Aryanayakum and Smt. Asha Devi had given him. He considered those figures to be most revealing. They were proof positive of how quickly khadi could be introduced in the villages through Nayee Talim. Cloth produced by the children during the period of their training would be sufficient to cloth the entire village and it would be the cheapest cloth possible.
We should increase our love for khadi and serve the villages.
You should make all your dependents khadi wearers.
 I have compared khadi to the sun and the other industries to the planets in the solar system. Agriculture is a planet in this solar system but it cannot be the sun, for agriculture is not free. Those who till the land do not own it. The Government controls it through  petty officials. The people have lost self-confidence. Harmful customs have led to fragmentation of land. If I am alive fifty years hence and if by that time people have gained control of the land I shall reconsider its place in my solar system. I can say that agriculture by itself cannot develop the intellect as much as khadi and other village industries can. As the late Madhusudan once said, constant company of bullocks turns men into bullocks.
 The gist of what I have told you during the past two days is that if you have faith in my ideal you should put your whole effort behind it. The Shastras proclaim that Truth ever triumphs. This is a universally valid principle. If sometimes in life it is seen to fail the reason is not that the principle is at fault. It shows the imperfection of the man who is applying the principle. Once you have understood the principle you will have developed that detachment and that freedom
 
 from fear which is as important for the realization of an ideal as is faith in that ideal.

192,"March 	25, 1945",ANSWERS TO QUESTIONSlibtech_152_footnote,"
          March 	25, 1945 
  Q. 	1. Some 	members of the 	Charkha Sangh took a 	leading part in 	sabotage activities.	The Government became suspicious and took represssive measures  against 	such organizations. In such a situation, is it not a mistake to put 	the entire blame on the Government? A. 	Just because some worker went astray, it was wrong to punish  	the Charkha Sangh. I blame the Government entirely for its 	high-handedness.  Q. 2. Some Congressmen whose faith in non-violence was not very strong ...  are 	full of 	ideas regarding sabotage.	How 	can these people be 	weaned away  from  these 	ideas?  A. Those who have lost 	faith in non-violence will recover it through the work of the people 	who have retained their faith. They will never recover it through 	reprimands. They are following their own convictions. Let us be 	perfect as they are imperfect Darkness is dispelled by the rising of 	the sun.  Q. 	3. These days the committees for constructive work appointed by the 	Congress are full of people with the ideas mentioned in question No. 	2. There are some devoted people too. Do you believe that the 	constructive work can make progress with the help of such 	committees? A. 	The constructive work will proceed if the people having faith  	can give expression to their faith not through words but through 	deeds.  Q. 	4. Under such circumstances, would it not be better that the people 	having faith in non-violence should carry on their work 	independently of others? A. 	The answer is contained in the previous answers and also in my 	speech.libtech_153_footnote       
 Q. 5. Those who have no faith in non-violence and, for that reason, are not able to contribute to the programme based on non-violence are in a very uncomfortable position in the constructive work committees. This has  a  demoralizing effect on them. In such a situation would it not be proper to let their efforts find scope in Parliamentary activities?
A. Do we restrict anyone from going into the Parliament? It is
enough that we do not go ourselves.
 Q. 6. Will there not be greater scope for basic education, stopping corruption, improving the food situation, removing the difficulties of the villagers and so on, if the Congress assumes power?
 A. It may or may not happen. It will depend on what type of
people come forward and on the state of public opinion.
 Q. 7.... Can I give my opinion in favour of bringing electricity to  the  villages, particularly in Hudli? . . .
A. I am strongly opposed to it.
 My answers are not meant for publication. Yon can show them to friends.

  From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and Library.  Courtesy: 	Beladevi Nayyar and Dr. Sushila Nayyar         [March 	26, 1945]libtech_156_footnote  CHI. 	MUNNALAL,  	Here is for your guidance. There must be rules, and they must be 	obeyed. Manage somehow during these five days. Then after my return 	we shall see. I am in favour of two kitchens. If I were in your 	place, I would attend to everything you mention and do it well. I 	have done that. But that does not mean that, your doing what I would 	have done will necessarily bear fruit. There is no such rule. You 	may act as you like, but on one condition, namely, that you must be 	absolutely sure that you are following truth and ahimsa. If the 	persons you have named do not observe the rules, you should talk to 	them one by one and find out why. If a person admits the fact, you 	may make an exception in his favour, and if you find that the 	exceptions are so many that they defeat the rule you should revise 	the rule. I understand from what you write that the exceptions do 	defeat the rule. This isindeed a  hotel. But it is more than that. A 	 hotel is a  place  where     5.15 	a. m. on March 25, and this letter was acknowledged at 6.15 a. m. on 	March 26. 
 people pay for boarding and lodging. They order and get whatever they want, and feel no embarrassment. It should be so here also. Here, too, we must have some rules, as every hotel has. For instance, we would serve no non-vegetarian food or cater to  people’s  taste  in regard to spices. Let Shakaribehn start a separate kitchen. Anybody else who wishes may also do that. Meet every permanent resident and know from him or her their wishes, then frame rules and get them passed in the presence of all and see that everyone observes the rule which he himself has accepted. I knew about Kamle today by chance. He is suffering from dysentery. I have asked him today to go immediately. He should have gone earlier. It was only from your note that I came to know that Gurbuxani and Vimalabehn have made separate arrangements for their meals. You ought to have complete information as to which persons do that and why. Instead, you permit anarchy to reign. Is it right? I think I have given all the guidance you need.
 Now think over Sushilabehn’s advice. A plate, a cup for water, two bowls and one spoon. The plate, the cup and the bowls should be nickel-plated. About the spoon I am not convinced. Two bowls may be all right, though I am not sure. Serving ghee with the vegetable will not do. Perhaps it will not do even to put it on the chapatis. If the vegetable is served in a bowl, ghee may be added to it. But I have seen only one bowl in many places.
 I am giving no ruling in this matter. Personally, I would provide only one bowl. But I give no ruling.
 You had told me that you would take out from your notebook and give me the portions regarding myself. Do that before my departure.
 The decision to talk to every permanent resident in private, to frame rules and discuss them in the presence of all is for immediate implementation. About the separate kitchen it should be postponed till my return. Show me the rules. Those who wish to have separate arrangements from today may be permitted to have them.

 March 26, 1945
 CHI. MUNNALAL,
 It would be better if the thing was done before I left  for  Bombay. libtech_157_footnoteBut do not sacrifice your sleep for that.
 I was glad that the problem about Sushilabehn had been solved. My success holds no lesson for anybody, but it may give one hope. There may be many reasons for my success. According to me, the chief reason is my ahimsa. From your point of view it is true that your training has not fitted you for managing a kitchen. When you learn non-attachment you will not say that. We are fit enough for any duty that comes to us unsought. The secret is that we do not run after any task; the task comes to us unsought. If you look upon a servant as your own brother or sister, you will never fail. Yesterday the kedgeree was not well cooked. Manu refused to eat it and so I examined it with my fingers. Finding that it was insufficiently cooked I made her a sign that she need not eat it. If I had insisted, she would have consumed it and suffered from stomachache in consequence. If everybody had eaten it that would have been no evidence that it was well cooked.
 I explained to Kalukhan himself about  Magandeep.  I understand about Aundh. I think nothing remains now.
   [PS.]  Blessings 	from  BAPU    	Instead of engraving people’s names on the utensils, they 
  	should be numbered. This is the practice in jails, as also in 	institutions. Instead of purchasing additional utensils, find some 	way out. In the last resort, we can always have [leaf cups]libtech_158_footnote. 	If you can  have inexpensive earthen ones you may have them. 	Everybody may make for himself spoons of wood. We can teach them. It 	is quite easy to learn. Think what the poor would do and find some 	way. Discuss the matter with the permanent residents. Mohan Singh 	will probably suggest something. Moreover, now I shall be leaving, 	so you will have no difficulty during that time. Think over the 	matter before I return. You can certainly make wooden ones. We used 	to do that in S. A. The wood and the knife were supplied by the jail 	authorities.  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: C.W. 5863. Courtesy: Munnalal G. Shah

It is for you to reach it or not. How 	can I say that you can do so much and no more? I shall try to adjust 	myself to you as much as I can. Perhaps there is no spare pair of 	sandals. You will get the loin-cloth. It cannot be called a lungi. 	A lungi cannot be tucked up from behind. Bhansali and 	Balkrishna wear lungis. Give up hope of sandals. I have no 	spare pair at all.  	About the books, after my return. Use the ones which are lying with 	me. Make notes from them and give me a copy. Wooden sandals are 	inexpensive and easy to make. You may use leather or webbing or 	cloth for the strips. You should train people one by one to join in 	the prayers. If they are not prepared to give that much time, only 	those who can sing in tune may join. The truth is that even after so 	many years people have developed no deep interest in the prayers. 	Theattendance at morning prayers is practically nil. But don’t 	exert yourself about this just now. If nobody joins the [Gita] 	recitation,    
 drop it. It will be enough if you keep up the other items of the programme. Since you do not know the beauty of joint recitation, you have not been able to describe it. Everybody gets breathing time and yet they all seem to be singing in unison. I am saying this from experience. Don’t write to other institutions now to make any inquiry. Will there be a shortage of rooms after I leave? I will see about Hari-ichchha. It is easy to turn steam into water. We should learn to do that. Take Mohan Singh’s help.

 This will not do. If you cling only to the letter, the letter will be your undoing. You should insist and yet it should not be insistence. After all, there has to be a compromise between detachment and insistence.
 The responsibility is...libtech_174_footnotebut at some point you would also have to assume it. A true worker would take upon himself the complete responsibility of rendering service, would he not? Keep in mind the shloka	:   libtech_175_footnoteWhy should you be scared of everything? And why should you have been startled? Why do renunciation and sacrifice mean the same thing? How is it that day and night are different and yet the same? A human being is a body and a soul and yet he transcends the body. Understand all these things.

 CHI. CHIMANLAL,
 Have you read my letter to Krishnachandra? One cannot observe one dharma by violating another. I have not at all given a one-sided decision. Krishnachandra should come to a decision after fullconsideration. I remain neutral. All of you should arrive at a joint decision. And you should do it promptly without fear  of going wrong. A mistake can always be corrected.
 It is all right if Prabhakar looks after the girl. It is, however, not at all desirable. Some woman ought to look after her. It is not a burden. It is a matter of duty.
 I think it will not be possible for me to  accommodate Ramprasad. R. P. is an absolutely independent-minded person. Besides, I must have Sushila’s consent too. We should act under the assumption that it is her responsibility.
 I consider it a serious defect that you could not frame the rules. Now this covers everything.

 I read your papers. I had a talk with Jajuji. I think I shall be able to cope with the matter. Let us see what happens.
 You should be alert. Understand your responsibility. Give up what your body does not accept. Shakaribehn can do much, but that depends on you. If Hoshiaribehn opens up she can go far. Anasuya cannot be kept with Prabhakar. But if nobody else takes charge of her, there will be no alternative. Do what you think best. Since I shall not be there, some accommodation must be available. Have a frank talk with Ashadevi. Remember the dictum: “Speak the truth, speak gently”, and understand its meaning.

           BOMBAY, 
  March 	31, 1945  	The National Weeklibtech_184_footnotewill 	be presently on us. We began to observe the Week in 1919. We had the 	unexpected and spontaneous manifestation of the villagers all over 	India. Seven days after, Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also unthought 	of, took place. We have observed the Week ever since in triple 	expectation of achieving communal unity, full establishment of 	khaddar and swaraj. We seemed to be at one time within an ace of the 	triple achievement. But today we seem to be very far. I advisedly 	use the verb “seem”. The goal ever seems to recede from us but 	if we have honestly worked for it, it really comes nearer. Anyhow I 	feel so. We were never nearer the goal than now in spite of our many 	blunders. It is as well that we remember our blunders and fail to 	notice the successes lying underneath. Only our blunders must never 	dishearten us. We must learn to profit by them and correct them. 	Then every blunder will hearten us, for we shall mount a step higher 	by unlearning each blunder. Thus it becomes a cleansing process. Let 	it be noted that khaddar has attained a wider connotation than 	before. It has become the central sun round which other village 	industries revolve like so many planets. Moreover it now represents 	the fifteenfold constructive programme. Khaddar itself has after 	much experience got its proper value and thus has received a dignity 	never before given to it. Everyone is now able, with the 	introduction by Vinoba of ‘tunar’ libtech_185_footnoteto make his or her ‘punis’ libtech_186_footnoteand spin with ease. The wheel too has undergone radical 	improvement and the new process of doubling yarn has made it as 	strong as one could wish for weaving. Would that every lover of 	freedom of India will remember these things during the Week and 	bring freedom nearer than ever before without parliamentary 	programme and even civil disobedience unless the Government drive 	workers to it by talking of India’s freedom without meaning it.

 The Executive sat today and among other things considered your budget. The correspondence between you and Bapa was read. Your letter was finished and I saw at the end that you had meant it to be confidential. There was no reason for it. There was nothing to be ashamed of in it. Your own part was creditable to you and so was Kamlabai’s and her husband’s. Her salary should be drawn to the extent of her needs. She must not be a burden on her husband.
 Since Bapa agrees that you can have the furniture, your estimate is right. But I question the necessity of all furniture. You should squat an the ground. Then you don’t need chairs and tables at all. Mats are quite enough. You may need a ground desk for the typist. That would be cheap. You may have open racks. You have provided for a safe.
 You can draw Rs. 150 and divide between the two institutions as occasion requires. Please redraw your budget in the light of what I have said and send. I shall have the power to sanction your budget if I approve of it.
     [PS.]  Yours 	sincerely,  BAPU   You need 	only a Tamil typewriter. Your correspondence with the

Also 	G.N. 8266         BOMBAY,  April 	3, 1945  Gandhiji 	said that it was a matter for shame that they had come to pray to 	God but failed to conduct the prayer peacefully. People shouted and 	did not allow the prayer to go on, as it should go on.libtech_196_footnote  Continuing, 	he said that he had been told by a friend that the people of Bombay 	would derive no benefit from his prayer. They would throw a few 	rupees for the Harijan Fund, but if he thought that it was going to 	produce any effect on them or       
 that they would embrace the Harijans as their own kith and kin he was mistaken.
 “If you want, you go to Bombay. You will get money but as far as prayers are concerned, it is better to stay at home and pray,” the friend had warned him.
 Gandhiji said that he was not entirely convinced. They could not see God with the naked eye. They could not touch Him with their hands. He had become an untouchable. And no wonder, considering that there was so much sin abroad, such violence, drinking and gambling. Forty crores of people were in serfdom. This was because they only talked of freedom but they did not know what freedom was really worth. But he told this friend that he had always conducted prayers for a long time. He was a firm believer in prayer. Every religion had taught that man was no man if he did not pray to his Maker. Therefore he had told this friend that though there was not much chance of his advice being followed, he could not give up his principles. If he did not trust the people even that much, he would be worth nothing. If he gave up prayer the next thing for him to do would be to give up the struggle for freedom, the striving for truth and non-violence.
 He told the people that they should let him come and go without rushing towards him. They should keep silent during prayers.
 In conclusion, Gandhiji asked them how, if they could not control themselves, they could wield the reins of power. He would come there the next day and every day thereafter as long as he stayed in Bombay. He would watch how far his words had gone home. He would find out how far they were fit to govern themselves. The man with God in his heart would know how to control himself.

 Your 	first view is correct.  My 	view about propagation 	of music 	is that 	that alone is real 	music which uplifts the 	soul. This contains 	everything I should 	like to suggest.  I 	have already explained 	that music is a 	constructive activity, 	but that it 	is not included 	in the 	Congress programme. 	Swaraj can be 	conceived without 	it. It 	cannot, therefore, 	be one 	of the 	objects for 	which Narandas is 	collecting a 	fund. That is 	why I have said that, if 	we do not demand a salary for you, you should take the money from me. 
 
 
 It would be all right if you took it from the Satyagraha Ashram  money lying with Narandas If there is any difficulty in doing even that, I would find the money in some other way.

277,"April 6, 1945",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
    
 BOMBAY
 April 6, 1945
 Gandhiji began by asking people to keep silent and listen patiently to whatever he had to say. Nobody should clap hands. He wanted their ear; he wanted their heart. If his words reached their hearts through their ears, he would be satisfied.
 He congratulated them on their disciplined behaviour since Tuesday. On that day two women had been hurt. They had been perhaps touched by the incident and had decided   to maintain discipline and allow the prayers to go on as usual. On that day, there was  a large crowd not lakhs but a few thousands. Whether it was because of thefact that there were fewer people or for any other reason, he was glad to find that they had learnt discipline. If they wanted to live together the first lesson they should learn was one of discipline.
 Continuing, Gandhiji said that he was a Gujarati and should normally speak in Gujarati. But it had been decided that whenever there was a cosmopolitan gathering they should speak in the national language. He was responsible for that decision as much as others. They had also to learn both the scripts, namely, Nagari and Urdu. And they should learn to speak in such a simple way that everybody would understand it. He had now realized that Urdu, Hindi, and Hindustani were all the same language. If they learnt that language they could deal with members of any community and people from any part of India. It served him when he went to the Punjab. It would serve him if  he were to go to Kashmir—he had not been there, but he had some Kashmiri friends— Jawaharlal was one of them. Gandhiji said that it was wrong to refer to a Muslim language or a Muslim script. Both Hindus and Muslims wrote that language and if they wanted to steal the hearts of these people, they should be able to speak the same language and write in that script.
 Adverting to the National Week, Gandhiji said that they had been observing the Week for the last 26 years. Its observance was meant for the purification of their thoughts and their language. In the beginning, the Week commenced with a fast. He had since abandoned that. He had also abandoned hartal. The Week, however, had not become less holy on that account. The fifteen-point programme was there. It began with khadi. From that followed other items. On such a holy day the people should begin to observe the fifteen-point programme. He was not asking them to observe it only for the Week but for all time. They should not only follow it themselves but induce other people to do so. If they wanted to make India free and not wait for others to free her, if they wanted to get freedom by truthful and non-violent means, there was  no other way. But if it was to be by violence and revolution, that was another thing.
 He had not known that method; he had not learnt it. Freedom would not fall from the skies nor would it rise from the deep. If they wanted to get it from their own efforts, there was only one way.
 Some people thought in terms of Parliament. He did not want to utter its name. He wanted to forget Parliament but to think only of the constructive programme. An important item of this programme was Hindu-Muslim unity.
 Concluding, Gandhiji said:
 Freedom is in our hands. When we breathe, we cannot take other people’s help. If we resort to artificial methods of respiration, it means that we are on the brink of death. Freedom is like our breath.Having lost it for a long time we do appreciate it. But I know the nature of freedom. I have fully experienced freedom. And if you regard it as holy and worthy of achievement, this is the only way.

I  can, therefore, give you the  	conditions of a successful strike. The first is that the cause 	should be clear and just. Secondly, the strikers should be firm and 	not be afraid of starvation, physical assaults or even death. 	Thirdly, they should never deviate from the path of  truth  and  	ahimsa  in   whatever  they     
 might do. Fourthly, the strikers should have public support behind them. If you can satisfy all these four conditions you should stand firm, but if you fall short in any of these respects you should boldly retrace your steps. I cannot give you further guidance. The details are for you to decide.
 In answer to their further request that he should address an appeal to the Directors of the Company, most of whom were Indians, Gandhiji said:
It is not my practice to interfere in a matter with which I am not
 fully acquainted. I do not even know who are on the Board of Directors. If, as you say, the Board is composed predominantly of Indians your task ought to be easy. My function ceases with  the advice. The time is perhaps past when I could lead strikes myself. If you understand this limitation of mine you will save my time as wellas yours. Time in your case is the very essence. You have therefore to act promptly. If you carefully ponder over what I have said you will find that I have told you everything.
 The deputationists finally asked whether Gandhiji would not appeal to the public to support them. Gandhiji replied:
It is not my word but your conduct that can win for you public
 support.

         CHI. 	GHANSHYAMDAS,    April 	9, 1945 
  	Can you read my handwriting? If you find it difficult, I shall in 	future dictate my letters.  	Days pass and there is no time left for a heart-to-heart talk. I 	shall, therefore, put down in writing what I have to say. That way I 	should be able to have my say. You can reply in a few words. This 	does not, of course, mean that I am withdrawing what I have said. I 	will not leave here till I have given you time but I do not wish to 	postpone what I have to say. Profulla Babu said to me: “Krishnakumar 	and Madhav Prasad have now become so big that they could not even 	come to see me in my illness. Formerly they did visit me 	occasionally and also asked me questions.” It seems to be a case 	of negligence. There is no question here of big and small. I had 
 asked Profulla if I could bring this matter up.
  My 	work has 	increased. My 	endeavour now 	is to see 	that no 	one expects 	any money 	from me 	and the institutions 	I have 	created become 	self-supporting. This 	will, of 	course, take some 	time and 	meanwhile I shall 	have to find 	money for them. 	The institutions 	are All-India 	Spinners’ Association, Village Industries Association, Nayee 	Talim, Hindustani 	Prachar and the Ashram. 	The second, 	third, fourth and 	fifth need the 	money now. So 	far as 	the fifth, 	the Ashram, is concerned 	it will 	never be 	self-supporting. I 	am doing 	my best 	of course. The Ashram 	also includes 	the hospital. 	The monetary provision 	for the hospital 	is separate. 	Efforts are being 	made to secure 	funds for 	it from 	various sources. Still 	the annual 	expenses of the 	Ashram alone are 	in the neighbourhood of 	Rs. 100,000. 	I am quotingthe 	figure from memory. 	The Ashram 	is not 	in need 	of funds 	at  present. 	  Rameshwardaslibtech_210_footnotesends   the  needed  money.  As  for 	  the 	second, third 	and fourth, 	they need the money. 	I believe Rameshwardas has sent 	some money. Money 	is needed 	for the 	propagation of 	Hindi and for Nayee 	Talim. Probably I 	shall want Rs. 	200,000. Are 	you disposed to 	take this burden 	on your 	shoulders? As 	for the “Sufferers’ Fund”libtech_211_footnotelibtech_212_footnote, Rameshwardas’s letter mentions it. I have also 	given my opinion.  Now 	for my relationship 	with women and 	my experiment. 	I have 	suspended the 	experiment for 	the sake of 	co-workers. I 	did not 	see anything 	improper in it. I am the 	same who took a 	vow of brahmacharya 	in 1906 	and have been observing 	brahmacharya since 	1901. Today I 	am a 	better brahmachari 	than I 	was in 	1901. What my 	experiment has 	done is 	to make me 	more firm in 	my brahmacharya. The 	experiment was 	designed to 	make of myself 	a perfect 	brahmachari? 	and if 	God so 	wills it 	will lead to  perfection. You wanted 	to talk 	to me and 	question me 	on the subject. 	You may do 	both. Please do 	not hesitate. 	It will be unbearable if 	there is 	any hesitation 	in one 	with whom I have 	such intimate relations 	and whose 	money I 	have been so 	freely spending. 
 It is good that two of your brothers are together. This letter is certainly for both but you may take it that it is indeed for all the brothers and the entire family.

 [PS.]
 I had thought of writing a short letter, but it has become
somewhat lengthy. After all it covers three points.
 I forgot to mention one thing. You have given Rs. 50,000 for the Ashram land which has been transferred to the goshala. Now the list that Chimanlal has sent mentions the Ashram field and some land with a well in it. If that is so, then all the houses go too. This cannot be so. It must have been an oversight. Though letters were sent to Janakidevi and others there was no result. Now, if you think that the entire land with the well has been given to the goshala, then a certain amount will have to be deducted from your Rs. 50,000. Do what you think proper.

All great men have a passion for simplification. You have simplified 	the    
 nature of human conflict as between violence and non-violence, truth and untruth, right and wrong. But in life, is not the conflict between one right and another right or between one truth and another truth? How can non-violence deal with  such  a situation?
A. That is a matter of application.
 Q. In the Hindu-Muslim question where the conflict is between the rights of the Hindus and the rights of the Muslims, what technique of non-violence can  be  employed to solve the problem, especially when these rights seem to be irreconcilable?
A. That awful situation can only be dealt with properly through
satyagraha.
 Your questions show that you have not studied it. If I am right, P[yarelal] will give you a list of the books. My advice to you is that you should seriously study the literature on the subject.

CAMPlibtech_216_footnote","
    
 April 11, 1945
 Gandhiji began his remarks by requesting themlibtech_217_footnoteto give him a little respite. There was a time and place for everything in life, he told them. He had trained himself   to listen to the inner voice irrespective of his surroundings. But in that he had succeeded only partially. He could not keep himself absolutely unaffected by his surroundings. Therefore he requested the photographers to spare him while he was trying to express his deepest feelings. Photography out of time and place was not art but vulgarity.
 Dealing with the question of prayer” he said that he had learnt that common prayers had been excluded from their routine lest anyone should feel that religion was being imposed upon her or him. Speaking for himself” he could say that he could do and had often done without food for days on end, but he could not do without prayer even for a single day. Individual prayer was there but no one should fight shy of collective prayer. Man is a social being. If men and women could eat together, play together and work together why should they not pray together? Why should anyone feel the need to pray away from everybody’s gaze? Was there anything sinful orshameful in prayer that it should not be said in public? For close on fifty years he had been a believer in public prayer. From his earliest days in South Africa he had among his associates and co-workers men and women of every religion. Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Parsis, all used to join him in prayer. In India men and women in crowds attended his prayers wherever he went. He had been told that they did not come to attend the prayers. They came just to have his darshan. Even if it was so, they came because they wanted to join him-— a man of prayer. He was aware that he had not come as near to God as he wanted to. His realization of truth and ahimsa was still far from perfect, otherwise there would be no need for him to use speech. His very being would radiate truth and ahimsa so that they would be able to see it on his face and feel its presence. He had often said that the perfect ahimsa of one individual was quite enough for the whole world. Whatever measure of success he had attained in the realization of truth and non-violence was the result of prayer.
 Prayer should be a spontaneous welling up of the heart. One should not pray if one felt that prayer was a burden. God was not hungry for man’s prayer or praise. He tolerated all because He was all Love. If they felt that they owed a debt to Him who is the Giver of all things” they should remember Him and pray to Him out of sheer
 
 gratitude. The fear of incurring anybody’s ridicule or displeasure should never deter one from performing one’s elementary duty towards the Maker. To illustrate his remark he told them the story of Prophet Daniel.
 Answering next Shrimati Mridulabehn’s question as to what were the good and bad points of Indians as a nation, he observed that he was convinced that in the sum the former far outweighed the latter. Indians had many defects. India was a slave country and her slavery dated much farther back than the British conquest of India. Slavery of evil customs and superstitions” he knew, was the worst form of slavery. Yet the solace that he could find in India he could find nowhere else. He had lived in England and he had spent the best part of his life in South Africa. Yet he could not adopt those countries as his home. In reply to a friend’s query years ago” he had said that he wanted to die in the lap of his mother. His own mother, who was a frail little woman, had died years ago. But Mother India with her 80 crores of hands 80 crores of feet and 40 crores of mouths had beckoned to him from across the seas and he could not resist that call.
 What did it matter if that venerable mother appeared sick and paralysed today? It was not for him to proclaim India’s virtues. As for her shortcomings he had been proclaiming them from the house-tops ever since his return to India. But if he were pressed to name only one shortcoming of Indians he would say that the worst was cowardice.
 Another friend asked how women could go into the villages and work under the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund scheme handicapped as they wereby so many restrictions. Gandhiji’s reply was that he had expected that their first lesson in the camp was to learn to break all social restrictions that cramped or degraded them. He, however, warned them that this did not mean throwing off of all moral restraints. There was at present a woeful deterioration of moral standards in society among men. Even those who talked loudly about enforcing monogamy through law did not practise it themselves. The same tendency was beginning to manifest itself among women. He had known educated girls who thought nothing of marrying men having a living wife. He called this degradation of womanhood. Such views could not be defended under the pretence of banishing social superstitions or vice. Did the emancipation of women mean that they should imitate men in that respect? Certainly not. India could never win swaraj, certainly not the swaraj of his conception, by following that path.
 Uttermost moral purity was the first requisite for establishing social freedom. No one who lacked moral purity was qualified to lead a crusade against evil social restrictions.
 The next question was how they were to deal with the question of untouchability in the villages. He agreed that the problem of untouchability in the
 villages was very acute. But those who went there should go with the grim determination to destroy it root and branch or perish in the attempt. They should begin with the scavengers. Unfortunately, there was untouchability even among the so-called untouchables. They should mix with them and eat and drink with them, provided they observed the rules of cleanliness and sanitation. They could inculcate these habits upon them by cooking for them and cleaning up their homes for them.
 Another question expressed the fear that since capitalists had contributed the bulk of the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund and since they were taken on committees their influence would dominate the organization and vitiate it.
 Gandhiji dismissed the apprehension as groundless. He maintained that in endorsing the acceptance of donations of the rich he had not in any way accepted their dictation nor did they seek or expect any such thing from him. Moneyed men were in a majority only in the Board of Trustees, but that did not mean that they dominated or wanted to dominate the organization. In fact they had offered voluntarily to retire from the Board after the fund had been collected and would have gladly done so had he expressed such a desire. But he wanted not only their donations but their talent” goodwill and services for the cause and so they continued to be on the Board.
 He refused to believe that the capitalists were necessarily a bad lot or worse than members of any other class. In this world everyone was imperfect. He was too well aware of his own imperfections to presume to judge others. His ahimsa required him to be rigorous in viewing his own shortcomings but to be charitable in judging others.  It was enough if he could eradicate his own. If, therefore, instead of cavillingat the faults of others we turned the searchlight inward and concentrated on self-purification, the world would become a better place to live in and the general social purification would be reflected in the capitalist class too. He could not therefore say to the capitalists that unless they renounced all their riches he would have nothing to do with them. Complete renunciation of one’s possessions was a thing which very few even among the ordinary folk were capable of. All that one could legitimately expect of the wealthy class was to hold their riches in trust and use them for the service of society. To insist upon more would be to kill the goose that laid the golden eggs.

304,"April 	11, 1945",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
           BORIVLI, 
  April 	11, 1945  Gandhiji 	said he 	was reminded 	by Balasaheb 	Kher that he 	had visited 	Borivli after 	twenty years. He did not 	think it 	was such a 	long time. He 	was glad to 	be able to 	renew their 	acquaintance after such a 	long period. 	On them rested a  great 	responsibility owing 	to Shrimati 	Mridulabehn’s shibir 	in their 	midst. They should 	interest themselves in 	it. He 	then turned 	to Khan 	Saheb and 	said, if 	he was to 	be friends 	with Khan Saheb was he 	to expect him 	to learn 	Sanskritized Hindi or was 	he, the 	speaker, bound to speak and write to him in Urdu? But Khan Saheb was 	everyone’s friend. 	Therefore it was the duty 	of the audience 	to learn 	the national 	language in both 	the forms 	and both 	scripts. Thus and thus 	alone could the All-India 	language permeate the 	whole of 	India. In 	this at 	least there should be 	no Pakistan and 	he who 	wished to 	make common cause with 	Hindus and Muslims 	was bound 	to learn 	the two scripts 	and two 	forms. A time would then come when the two forms of speech would 	become one.   If they 	felt it a burden 	to learn 	the scripts, 	he could 	only say swaraj 	was not to 	be had easily and without toil. Where there was love toil was no trouble but pleasure.  The 	speaker then alluded to the evening bhajan 	sung at the prayer. 	Its burden was that the way to God was for the valiant, not for the 	timid. But God was not to be reached by slaves. Therefore the bhajan 	was also for those 	who wanted to throw off their slavery.  The 	speaker then concluded that slavery must be the lot of those who 	hugged untouchability and that too in the name of religion. He 	wanted therefore to repeat what he had said so often, namely, that 	Hinduism must perish if untouchability lived.libtech_218_footnote  The 	Bombay Chronicle, 13-4-1945

 April 12, 1945 I have no difficulty in agreeing with the scientific views of Madame Montessori. However, if they are propagated in their Western
garb in Indian villages they are more likely to prove useless and might
 even prove harmful, because in that garb they will be too expensive for Indian villages and ill-adapted to the village atmosphere. It is possible the cities may not feel the expense so much and women influenced by Western ways may be receptive to the ideas presented in Western garb; but even so it will be of no use because India lives not in cities but in its seven lakh villages. Besides, scientific education with Western trappings might prove poisonous to the city-dwellers because here education begins the moment the child is conceived and ends no one knows when. These days the cities are created by the foreigners toserve their ends and so they do not represent the villages. They do not protect the interests of the villagers but are becoming their exploiters.

Everyone cannot go to a cool place. 	You must make that place itself as cool as you can. Take Dr. 	Kelkar’s help. He is a nice man and he has written to me about 	this.

 April 15, 1945
 I am sorry to say that what appears to have been meant as a supplement to the constructive programme is its flat contradiction. And it is unworkable. If put in action, it will [not only] frustrate itself but will largely hamper the constructive programme.  But  this  is merely a caution. Those who believe in this programme must prosecute it till they are convinced to the contrary. That is the best argument.
 Hence I do not want to reason even if I had the time which I have not just now.

           BOMBAY, 
  April 15, 1945 Gandhiji wanted to refer to a conversation he had with a friend. He was asked to  define who was a Gandhi-ite as there was confusion in the public mind. He could  safely 	say there was no Gandhi-ite in India. He was himself not one. He had 	founded no cult. He claimed to be a satyagrahi and” therefore, he 	was also non-violent, or was trying to be and he invited everyone in 	the audience to do likewise.  When 	the odds 	were heavy against them in 	South Africa, where they 	were in a hopeless 	minority, he 	had discovered satyagraha 	in 1906 	in the place of parliamentary 	programme. He had 	never been a 	member of 	any parliament 	or even 	a local 	board. He saw 	that non-violent 	non-co-operation was the 	most powerful thing 	instead. The 	constructive part 	was his 15- point 	programme which 	they had seen. 	There was swaraj in it 	and much more.  Satyagraha 	was not a mere policy with him, it was his creed. He hoped to see 	God face to face through it. If that was the power of satyagraha 	surely political swaraj was a simple matter if all took to it.  But 	his satyagraha told him 	that he 	was to bear with those 	who did not see eye to eye 	with him 	but sought to 	go through the 	parliamentary programme. 	They had 	known him closeted 	with Dr. Khan Saheb 	and his friends 	as also 	with Advocate Bhulabhai 	Desai. He told 	them to follow 	their belief. He owned 	no enemy—certainly 	not Englishmen 	and not even English 	officials. But that did 	not mean that he should 	follow them. He went his 	own way. The official way was to rule India, his was to serve India. 	The official 	was all for power, 	he was 	all for service and 	that in the 	name of God. 	Therefore he 	could afford to 	face the 	whole world’s 	opposition, for God, 	he believed, was 	with him 	and He was 	a never-failing, 	all-sufficing companion 	and infallible Guide.

 [April 16, 1945]libtech_250_footnote
 Instead of undertaking the thankless task of going through the jumble of my writings to find out what I have said or have not said about caste, you have done well in sending me the  following  questions.
  Do 	you still 	adhere to the 	views you 	have expressed on 	the caste 	system in your writings?  Do 	you still believe 	that the caste system 	is the 	best social order 	and that the 	world should adopt it?  Do 	you still 	believe that the 	thousands of 	existing sub-castes 	will disappear and 	merge so 	that in 	the end only 	the four 	varnas will remain? In 	the last 	twenty-five years how many sub-castes have thus disappeared and merged into bigger castes?  Whatever 	castes we find 	in history 	are all based 	on birth 	and the inequalities 	arising therefrom. 	Do you 	think that 	the equality and 	brotherhood you 	preach is 	consistent with 	that kind of social 	order? If the 	Bhangis go 	on doing the 	work of 	scavenging from one generation to the next, what will be their future? Isn’t Shri Sanjana’s severe criticism of the “Politics of the Cow”’ entirely 
 true?
 Will you give your consent to the bill introduced in the Central Legislature 
 for retaining caste differences in the Hindu Law?
  	“The 	Congress is 	an orthodox Hindu 	organization and under 	the fostering 	care of 	Gandhiji it has become a 	missionary organization 	for the renewal and 	well-being of 	the orthodox 	Hindu religion with its 	caste system.” What 	reply would 	you give to 	such allegations 	of Shri 	Sanjana? And 	if what 	Shri Sanjana says 	is correct, 	does it not 	repudiate the Congress 	claim of being 	a truly national 	organization?  Is 	the caste system 	consistent with 	democracy and democratic organizations? 
I do not need to refer to my past writings to say what I believe
 
 
 today, because only what I believe today counts. I wish to say that the caste system as it exists to day in Hinduism is an anachronism. It is one of those ugly things which will certainly hinder the growth of true religion. It must go if both Hinduism and India are to live and grow from day today. The way to do it is for all Hindus to become their own scavengers and treat the so-called hereditary Bhangis as their own brothers.
 I say the Bhangis because they are at the lowest rung of the ladder. This answers all the questions and I need say nothing more. It is evident that the questioner has not taken the trouble to read my writings. libtech_251_footnoteEverybody knows that the Congress from its inception
 has not been and is not even now an orthodox Hindu organization. It is a democratic organization comprising people holding different views and is daily becoming more and more so under my fostering care.

Courtesy: Pyarelal         BOMBAY,  April 	17, 1945  	Though I know that silence is better than the spoken or written 	word, there are well-defined limitations to the application of the 	maxim. The San Francisco Conference is announced to meet shortly.libtech_258_footnoteI do not know its agenda. Probably no outsider knows 	it. Whatever it may be, the Conference will have much to do with the 	world-to-be after the so-called end of the war. I very much fear 	that behind the structure of world security  sought  to  be  raised  	lurk  mistrust  and fear which breed war. Therefore as a lifelong 	believer in peace as against war, it seems well for me to record my 	convictions in the matter.  	I reiterate my conviction that there will be no peace for the Allies 	or the world unless they shed their belief in the efficacy of war 	and its accompanying terrible deception and fraud and  are  	determined to hammer out real peace based on freedom and equality of 	all races and nations. Exploitation and domination of  one 	nationover another can have no place in a world striving to put an 	end    
 to all wars. It is only in such a world that the militarily weaker nations will be free from the fear of intimidation or exploitation.
  An 	indispensable 	preliminary to 	peace is 	the complete freedom 	of India 	from all foreign 	control, not merely 	because it 	is a classic 	example of imperialist 	domination but specially 	because it is a big, 	ancient and 	cultured country which 	has fought 	for its freedom 	since 1920 	deliberately with 	Truth and Nonviolence 	as its only 	 weapon. 
 Though the Indian soldier has fought not for India’s freedom, he has shown during this war as never before that he is at least an equal of the best in his fighting qualities. I cite this to answer the charge that India’s peaceful struggle is due to its lack of soldierly quality. The inevitable deduction that is drawn from this is that non-violence of the strong is infinitely braver than their violence. That India may not yet have evolved such non-violence is another matter. If it is the case, it does not detract from the statement that it has battled non-violently for freedom and that not without considerable success.
  Freedom 	of India 	will demonstrate 	to all 	the exploited races 	of the 	earth that 	their freedom is 	very near and that in 	no case will 	they henceforth 	be exploited.  Peace 	must be 	just. In 	order to 	be that, it 	must neither 	be punitive 	nor vindictive. 	Germany and Japan 	should not be 	humiliated. The 	strong are 	never vindictive. 	Therefore, fruits of 	peace must 	be equally 	shared. The effort 	then will be 	to turn them into 	friends. The Allies can 	prove their democracy by 	no other 	means.  It 	follows from 	the foregoing 	that there 	will be 	no armed peace 	imposed upon the 	forcibly disarmed. 	All will be disarmed. 	There will be 	an international police 	force to enforce 	the lightest 	terms of peace. Even 	this retention of an 	international police 	will be a concession 	to human 	weakness, not 	by any means 	an emblem 	 of peace 	If these 	foregoing essentials of 	peace are 	accepted, it 	follows that 	the camouflage of 	Indian representation 	through  Indians 	nominated  by 	   British  imperialism  should 	   be  dropped.libtech_259_footnotelibtech_260_footnoteSuch 	representation will 	be worse 	than no representation. 	Either India at 	SanFrancisco is 	represented by 	an  elected  	representative  or represented 	not at all. 
 
 The following from the Congress resolution of August 8, 1942, shows clearly what free India stands for:
 While the A.I.C.C. must primarily be concerned with the independence and defence of India in this hour of danger, the Committee is of opinion that the future peace, security and ordered progress of the world demand a world federation of free nations, and on no other basis can the problems of the modern world be solved. Such a world federation would ensure the freedom of its constituent nations, the prevention of aggression and exploitation by one nation over another, the protection of national minorities, the advancement of all backward areas and peoples, and the pooling of the world’s resources for the common good of all. On the establishment of such a world federation, disarmament would be practicable in all countries, national armies, navies and air forces would no longer be necessary, and a world federal defence force would keep the world peace and prevent aggression. An independent India would gladly join such a world federation and co-operate on an equal basis with other countries in the solution of international problems.
 Thus the demand for Indian independence is in no way selfish.
Its nationalism spells internationalism.

 As India holds the key to the freedom of all the exploited races and nations of the earth so do Indians in South Africa hold the key to the protection and freedom of the exploited people in the overseas. For it was in South Africa that satyagraha was fairly tried and became largely successful. Will the Indians there unite and sacrifice themselves for the common cause?

  	Sushilabehn tells me that there is an understanding with Jajuji and 	the others that, apart from diagnosis and general treatment, the 	expenses on patent medicines should be borne by the patients 	themselves. They should not be purchased by the Hospital but should 	be procured by the patients as per the prescription. According to 	this arrangement, the cost of the distilled water should be 	recovered from those patients to whom it is given or the Ashram 	should pay if it wants. This is a matter of keeping accounts. 	Sushilabehn intends to make the Hospital self-reliant. It seems that 	the water is being distilled for Hari-ichchha, Kishorelalbhai and 	others. We cannot take money from them, so it seems to me that the 	expenses should be put in the Ashram account. Write to me if you 	have something different to say.

Then again I could not explain to you a very 	simple thing. I had made it clear at Indore that Hindi did not mean 	exclusion of Urdu. You yourself do not want to give up Urdu. Then it 	becomes your duty and mine—and of other patriots also—to know 	both the scripts and their styles. We include Urdu-knowing people in 	taking account of the supporters of the national language. Therefore 	the national language is=Hindi + Urdu. Hindi will be an incomplete 	national language if we take it in its narrow sense. Those imbued 	with nationalism will easily learn two more languages. Those who do 	not will lag behind. Such being my views, I will popularize 	Hindustani whether others support me or not. I am very keen to have 	yourwhole-hearted support because you are you and I have a great 	respect for you. 
 The poison cannot spread if supporters of Hindi put up with and take kindly to the popularization of Hindustani.

In particular he asked them to pray 	that the taint of untouchability might be removed root and branch 	and find no place in their hearts.  But 	he reminded them also that it was not enough if they prayed. While 	everything ultimately depended on the will of God they must do their 	duty.

 The two  things  mentioned  in  today’s  letter  which   I   have not scratched out deserve attention. Have you done anything about them?
 It shows that all of us, new members and old, men, women and children, should learn Hindustani. The necessary literature for that purpose should be collected.
 There is no truth as regards the bullocks. I think it is perfectly right about the dogs. Torturing is worse than killing.

 I have some respite here at any rate. So I am attending to the letters lying unanswered. One of the letters is from the Kauls. They have sent Rs. 1000 for the work Raja Saheb had mentioned in his letter to Dr. Mahmud. I do not now wish to issue an appeal about it. I do approve of such memorials, but the beginning should be made with the Punjab. I do not share Raja Saheb’s view that it is possible to collect one crore for the Hindu-Muslim work. Even so, a decent amount can be collected if an appeal is issued. You say that a large number of Muslims had attended the funeral. Will they  do  some work? Can you give your view? You are not the one to desist because Raja Saheb was your father. You are objective enough to consider the matter and give your opinion.
I shall be here for a month. Then Panchgani.

CONISTONlibtech_298_footnote","
  
 [Before April 25, 1945]libtech_299_footnote
 RALPH CONISTON: Why do you feel so sceptical about the possibility of a lasting peace emerging from the defeat of the Axis Powers?
GANDHIJI: The reason is patent. Violence is bound sooner or
 later to exhaust itself but peace cannot issue out of such exhaustion. I am uttering God’s truth when I say that unless there is a return to sanity, violent people will be swept off the face of the earth . . . Those who have their hands dyed deep in blood cannot build a non-violent order for the world.
 R. C. While the representatives of the big powers who would be meeting at San Francisco were what they were, the people at large, after the experience of the horrors of war, would force the hands of their respective Governments.
G.  I know the European mind well enough to know that when  it
 has to choose between abstract justice and self-interest, it will plump for the latter. The man in the street even in America does not think much for himself. He will put faith in what Roosevelt says. Rooseveltgives him market, credit and all that. Similarly Churchill can say to the English working class that he has kept the Empire intact and
 
 
 preserved for them the foreign markets. The people will, as they do, follow him.
 R. C. So, you don’t think that the average man in Europe or America cares much for the high ideals for which the war is professed to be fought?
G. I am afraid, I do not. If you hold the contrary view, I shall
honour you for your belief but I cannot share it.
 R. C. Then, you don’t think the Big Five or the Big Three can guarantee peace?
 G. I am positive. If they are so arrogant as to think that they can have lasting peace while the exploitation of the coloured and the so-called backward races goes on, they are living in a fool’s paradise.
 R. C. You think they will fall out among themselves before long?
 G. There you are stealing my language. The quarrel with Russia has already started. It is only a question when the other two—England and America—will start quarreling with each other. Maybe, pure self-interest will dictate a wiser course and those who will be meeting at San Francisco will say: ‘Let us not fall out over a fallen carcass.’ The man in the street will gain nothing by it. Freedom of India along non-violent lines, on the other hand, will mean the biggest thing for the exploited races of the earth. I am, therefore, trying to concentrate on it. If India acts on the square when her turn comes, it will not dictate terms at the Peace Conference but peace and freedom will descend upon it, not as a terrifying torrent, but as ‘gentle rain from heaven’. Liberty won non-violently will belong to the least. That is why I swear by non-violence. Only when the least can say, ‘I have got my liberty’ have I got mine.
 The conversation then turned on the issue of the treatment of the aggressor nations after the war.
G. As a non-violent man, I do not believe in the punishment of
 individuals, much less can I stomach the punishment of a  whole nation.
 R. C. What about the war criminals?
 G. What is a war criminal? Was not war itself a crime against God and humanity and, therefore, were not all those who sanctioned, engineered, and conducted wars, war criminals? War criminals are notconfined to the Axis Powers alone. Roosevelt and Churchill are no less war criminals than Hitler and Mussolini.
 Hitler was “Great Britain’s sin”. Hitler is only an answer to British imperialism, and this I say in spite of the fact that I hate
 Hitlerism and its anti-Semitism. England, America and Russia have all of them got their hands dyed more or less red—not merely Germany and Japan. The Japanese have only proved themselves to be apt pupils of the West. They have learnt at the feet of the West and beaten it at its own game.
 R. C. What would you see accomplished at San Francisco?
G. Parity among all nations—the strongest and the weakest
 —the strong should be the servants of the weak not their masters or exploiters.
 R. C. Is not this too idealistic?
 Maybe. But you asked me what I would like to see  accomplished. It is my belief that human nature is ever working upward. I can, therefore, never take a pessimistic view of the future of human nature. If the Big Five say, ‘We shall hold on to what we have’, the result will be a terrible catastrophe and then Heaven help the world and the Big Five. There will be another and bloodier war and another San Francisco.
 R. C. Would the results of the second San Francisco be any better than that of the first?
G. I hope so. They will be saner then. They will have gained
their balance somewhat after their third experience.
 R. C. Would you not go to the West to teach them the art of peace?
 G. In the second World War some British pacifists, including Dick Sheppard and Maude Royden had written to me asking me to point the way. My reply in substance was: Even if one of you can become true in the right sense of the word, that one man will be able to inculcate non-violence among the European folk. I cannot today save Europe, however much I may like to. I know Europe and America. If I go there I shall be like a stranger. Probably I shall be lionized but that is all. I shall not be able to present to them the science of peace in language they can understand. But they will understand if I can make good my non-violence in India. I shall then speak through India. I, therefore, declined to accept the invitations from America and Europe. My answer would be the same today.
 R. C. If you were at San Francisco, what would you be advocat-ing there?
 G. If I knew I would tell you but I am made differently. When I face a situation, the solution comes to me. I am not a man who sits down and thinks out problems syllogistically. I am a man of action. I
 react to a situation intuitively. Logic comes afterwards, it does not precede the event. The moment I am at the Peace Conference, I know the right word will come. But not beforehand. This much, however, I can say that whatever I say there will be in terms of peace, not war.
 R. C. What kind of world organization would promote an enduring peace or preserve it?
G. Only an organization based predominantly on truth and
non-violence.
 R. C. With the present imperfect condition of the world and human nature, what means would in your opinion promote peace?
G. Nearest approach to the condition laid down in my answer to
the previous question.
 R. C. Would you have a world government?
 G. Yes. I claim to be a practical idealist. I believe in compromise so long as it does not involve the sacrifice of principles. I may not get  a world government that I want just now but if it is a government that would just touch my ideal, I would accept it as a compromise. Therefore, although I am not enamoured of a world federation, I shall be prepared to accept it if it is built on an essentially non-violent basis.
 R. C. If the nations of the world were to consider world government as a means for preserving peace and promoting the welfare of all peoples, would you advocate the abandonment of India’s aspiration for independence ill order to join in the general plan?
G. If you will carefully go through the much abused Congress
 resolution of August 1942, you will discover that independence is necessary for India becoming an efficient partner in any scheme for the preservation of lasting peace in the world.

410,"January 1, 1945","A THOUGHT FOR
THE DAYlibtech_300_footnote","
  
 January 1, 1945 Thus, though we find the young and the old, the rich and the  poor, all passing away before our very eyes, we do not want to sit in
 peace; rather for the sake of living a few days more, we try everything
except Rama.
 January 2, 1945 How nice it would be if having realized this truth, we relied on Rama, put up with whatever ailments came our way and made our lives
peaceful.
 January 3, 1945 We saw the corporeal Mahadevlibtech_301_footnotelibtech_302_footnotein his physical body and in his writings—which  was  one  and  the   same   thing.  The   Mahadev, who
transcends the body is, however, all-pervading. He can be recognized
 by his virtues which we can all share alike. No one can have a greater or smaller share.
 January 4, 1945
 Are not birth and death perhaps the two sides of the same coin? You find death on the one side and birth on the other. Why should this give rise to sorrow or joy?
 January 5, 1945 If this be true of birth and death as it certainly is, then why should we fear death even in the slightest degree or sorrow over it and
rejoice in a birth? Every man should ask himself this question.
 January 6, 1945
 The world is full of opposites. There is sorrow behind happiness, and happiness behind sorrow. Where there is sunshine,there is also shadow; where there is light, there is also darkness; where there is birth, there is also death. Non-attachment lies in remaining unaffected
 
 by these opposites. The way to triumph over them is not to efface then, but to rise above them and be completely free from attachment.
 January 7, 1945
 The foregoing shows that the key to happiness lies  in  the worship of Truth, which is the giver of all things.
 January 8, 1945 How, then, shall we worship truth? Who knows the truth? The reference here is to relative truth, that which appears to us as truth.
 Experience will show that truth, even in this limited sense, is very hard
indeed to observe.
 January 9, 1945
 Why does a person, knowing what is truth, hesitate to utter it? Is he ashamed? Ashamed of whom? Whether high or low, what matters it? The fact is that habit consumes us all. Let us reflect over this and rid ourselves of the bad habit.
 January 10, 1945 Unless we are freed from this habit, we cannot tread the path of  truth. Indeed, we must sacrifice all at the altar of truth. We wish to
appear not as we are but as very much better. How nice it would be for
 us, if we are lowly, to appear lowly—but if we wish to rise, to act nobly and think nobly. If that be not possible, then let us appear lowly. Then some day we shall attain the desired height.
 January 11, 1945
 The more experience I gather, the more I realize that  man himself is the cause of his happiness as well as his misery.
 January 12, 1945
That being so, why is man happy or miserable?
 January 13, 1945 The fact is that man does not like to give any thought to such things; so he persuades himself to believe that he has no time to spare
for such reflection. On.
 January 14, 1945
 If we wish to live a true life, we must give up our mental laziness and do some basic thinking. Our life will thereby become very simple.
 January 15, 1945
 A seer has called us wayfarers. And it is true. We are here for only a few days. Thereafter we do not die, but only go home. What a
 beautiful and true thought!
 January 16, 1945
 Hundreds of tons of earth and stone have to be excavated by means of hard labour before even one diamond is discovered. Do we give even a fraction of this labour to the removal of the rubble of untruth and the search for the diamond of Truth?
 January 17, 1945
 Nothing is ever achieved without toil, that is without tapalibtech_303_footnote. How, then, can self-purification be possible without it?
 January 18, 1945
 If all our time belongs to God, how can we afford to waste even a single moment? Likewise, if we belong to God, why should we devote even a part of our being to the pursuit of the vain pleasures of life?
 January 19, 1945
 Selfless action is a source of strength, for such action means the worship of God.
 January 20, 1945 Jamshed Mehta has sent me one of the prayers of St. Francis of Assissi, a part of which reads: “O Divine Master! It is in giving that we
receive, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.”
 January 21, 1945
Verily, the land belongs to him who labours on it.
 January 22, 1945
He who is truly clean within, cannot remain unclean without.
 January 23, 1945
 A  right  cause   never   fails;   A  true  word   never   hurts  in   the
 end.   January 	24, 1945 A 	word uttered from a pure heart goes never vain.  January 	25, 1945  	If idleness gives us pain, we will not remain idle. Similarly, if 
 impurity 	causes us unhappiness, we will not be or stay impure.  Independence 	Day, January 	26, 1945 Work 	  must	come	first,	and	then,	if	possible,	wages    
 commensurate with the amount of work done. To work in this spirit is to serve God. But if the wages are demanded first, that would be service to Satan.
 January 27, 1945
 It is well not to yield to desire. Once we give in  restraint  becomes difficult if not impossible.
 January 28, 1945
 He who is unable to rule over himself can never really succeed in ruling over others.
 January 29, 1945
 In order to know himself, man must come out of his shell and view himself dispassionately.
 January 30, 1945
 No man is worthless who lightens anyone’s burden even the least bit.
 January 31, 1945
 Our happiness and peace of mind lie in our doing what we regard as right and proper, not in doing what others say or do.
 February 1, 1945
 Moral strength does accrue from the reading of scriptures; but real freedom cannot be attained without enlightenment.
 February 2, 1945
To seek a favour is to barter away one’s freedom.
 February 3, 1945
 The greatness of a person lies in his heart, not in his head, that is, intellect.
 February 4, 1945
 Religion is that which comprehends all. In other words, religion permeates life in all its aspects and at all times.
 February 5, 1945 Religion is not something apart from life. Life itself should be regarded as religion. Life divorced from religion is not human life, it
is animal life.
 February 6, 1945 Those who have the greatest measure of self-control or are most absorbed in work, speak the least. Speech and action go ill together.
 Look at Nature. She is continuously in action, never resting for a single moment, and is yet silent.
 February 7, 1945
 He who thinks of the suffering humanity, will not think of himself. Where has he the time?
 February 8, 1945
 A man will see and hear only that which he wishes to see and hear. A gardener will see only the flowers in a garden, whilst a philosopher will be oblivious of them. Perhaps he will not even notice whether he is inside the garden or outside!
 February 9, 1945
 We can see and even rectify our shortcomings through those we live with. If we maintain the highest standard of purity  in  our everyday life, we can hope to render real service.
 February 10, 1945 Those who take the vow of Truth should practise silence. Nevertheless, we find that many a seeker after Truth is given to much
 talking, the obvious reason being force of habit. Let us give up this
habit.
 February 11, 1945
 How shall we remember the dear departed? It is my firm belief that they do not die; it is only their bodies that perish. Their memory has to be kept alive by imbibing their virtues as far as we can, by taking up their good work and promoting it to the best of our ability. Flowers are placed on their samadhis  to  strengthen  such remembrance. But to remain content with mere flower-offering would be idol-worship.
 February 12, 1945
 How wrong it is to ask others to be clean when we ourselves remain unclean!
 February 13, 1945
 The only difference between man and man all the world over is one of degree, and not of kind, even as there is between trees of the same species. Why then anger, envy or discrimination?
 February 14, 1945
 Let a man not make a good resolution at all; but if he makes one after due deliberation, let him never abandon it.
 
 February 15, 1945
 Man’s capacity for self-deception is immeasurably greater than that for deceiving others. Every sensible person will testify to this.
 February 16, 1945
 Credit lies in restraining one’s anger against one’s own kith and kin. In the case of strangers, one is compelled to keep one’s temper under control. What merit can there be in that?
 February 17, 1945
 Life means not revelry—eating, drinking and making merry but praising God, i. e., rendering true service to humanity.
 February 18, 1945
 What distinguishes man from animals? Comprehensive thinking on this question will solve a lot of our problems.
 February 19, 1945 When man oversteps his limits, works or even thinks beyond his capacity, he is likely to be assailed by illness and anger. Such haste is
waste and can be harmful too.
 February 20, 1945
 In this morning’s bhajan it was said: “God never forgets us; it is we who forget Him. And that is our misery.”
 February 21, 1945
 When God does not wish it, neither wealth nor parents, nor the best of physicians, will save us. What, then, should we do?
 February 22, 1945
 Have we any right to pray so long as we have not purged ourselves of our impurities?
 February 23, 1945
 A man may use a rosary because it is blessed by a saint or made of sacred tulsilibtech_304_footnotelibtech_305_footnote, sandalwood or rudraksha beads. But if the user looks upon the rosary as all, he had better throw it away. If, however, the rosary draws him nearer to God and makes him alive to the performance of his duties, he may certainly use it regularly.
 February 24, 1945
 We exist, because God is. This shows that man, or any living being, is part of the Divine.
 
 February 25, 1945
 There is a sentence in the New Testment: Let there be no care in they heart, nor fear of aught.libtech_306_footnotelibtech_307_footnoteThis is for those who have faith in God.
 February 26, 1945 The same New Testment tells us that if God leads us into temptation, He also delivers us from evil.libtech_308_footnoteThis is applicable only to
those who do not, of their own accord, succumb to temptation.
 February 27, 1945
 It is not as if Tulsidas was the only one who had sung the glory of the Lord’s name. I find the same in the Bible as well. In Romans,
 X. 13, it is said: “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”
 February 28, 1945
 Sin stays not hid. It is writ large on the face of man. We do not fully know that book but the thing is plain.
 March 1, 1945
 These days I have been reading verses from the Bible. Today I find the following: “And all things, whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.”libtech_309_footnote
 March 2, 1945 “God is the Help of the helpless.” The same idea is also expressed in  Psalms,  XXXIV.  18,  which  says:  “The   Lord  is  nigh
 untothem that are of  a  broken heart; and seventh such as   be   of a
contrite spirit.”
 March 3, 1945
Isaiah, XLI. 10 has: “Fear thou not; for I am with thee.”
 March 4, 1945
 “Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.” Isaiah, XXVI. 4.
 March 5, 1945
 Just as it is in the nature of water to flow downward, so also does vice drags man downward and is, therefore, undoubtedly the easy way. Virtue takes a man upward and so appears to be rather difficult.
 
 
 
 March 6, 1945
 “My grace is sufficient for thee: for my  strength is  made perfect in weakness.” II Corinthians, XII. 9.
 March 7, 1945
 “God is our refuge and strength, a very present  help  in trouble.” Psalms, XLVI. 1.
 March 8, 1945
 God’s word is: “I am, was and ever shall be, I am everywhere and in everything.” Knowing this, we turn away from God, seek refuge in that which is perishable and imperfect, and thus make ourselves miserable. Can there be anything more amazing?
 March 9, 1945
 We must not draw distinctions between the East and the West. Everything must be judged on its merits. Thus alone can we do proper justice to things.
 March 10, 1945
 Why is there good and evil, happiness and misery? God is and yet He is not an individual. He is the Law as well as the Law-giver. Therefore it follows that man is what his actions make of him. He rises by good actions, and falls by evil ones.
 March 11, 1945 True service of society is that whereby society, that is, all its members, are uplifted. Only by studying a particular society will it be
possible to say how it can be raised.
 March 12, 1945
 Man knows very well that when death is near, there is no solace but God, yet hesitates to utter His name! Why?
 March 13, 1945
 There is only one way of achieving independence through non-violence: by dying we live, by killing never.
 March 14, 1945 How shall we die? By committing suicide? Never. To hold ourselves in readiness to die, when there is occasion for it, is to die
only to live for ever.
 March 15, 1945 There is nothing that cannot be attained by patience and equanimity. The truth of this can be verified in one’s daily
 experience.
 March 16, 1945
 Between destiny and  human  endeavour there is  an  inces-  sant struggle. Let us continue to endeavour and leave the result to God.
 March 17, 1945 Let us not leave everything to destiny, nor be vain about our endeavour. Destiny will take its own course. We should only see where
 we can intervene or where it is our duty to do so, whatever be the
result.
 March 18, 1945
 The pity is that even while knowing what our duty is, we fail to perform it! For this, let every man answer to himself.
 March 19, 1945
 Every moment of my life I realize that silence is the best speech. If you must speak, speak as little as possible. Avoid using two words if one suffices.
 March 20, 1945 When little things upset us, let us understand that there is attachment lurking somewhere. We should find it and banish it. It is a
 delusion to think that we remain upright in big things, for there we are
under compulsion. Surely, that cannot pass for uprightness.
 March 21, 1945
 On such occasions the verse to remember is: “Contacts of the senses with their objects come and go. Endure them.	libtech_310_footnote
 March 22, 1945
 Whatever one does, one must do well or not at all. The truth of this one observes every day. Today it was especially borne in upon me. It was Ba’s death anniversary, and so there was the usual Gita recitation. But there was no life in it.
 March 23, 1945
 A wrong ceases to be a wrong only when it is righted. If suppressed, it erupts like a boil and assumes a dangerous form.
 March 24, 1945
 Man rises by realizing the true nature of the Self, by meditating
 
 thereon and by following its virtues. A contrary course of action leads to his downfall.
 March 25, 1945
 What is patience? Shankaracharya says: “Sit by the seashore and take one drop of water on a blade of grass. If you have enough patience, and there is a place near by wherein that drop can be stored, you may in time empty the ocean of all its water.” This is  an illustration of almost perfect patience.
 March 26, 1945
 He who has not in him infinite patience cannot observe non- violence.
 March 27, 1945 What is the difference between a snake and a human being? Apparently a snake crawls on its belly, while man walks erect on his
 feet. Things are, however, not what they seem to be. For what about
the man who mentally crawls on his belly?
 March 28, 1945
 Every day I see the importance of silence. It is good for all, but for him who is deeply absorbed in work, silence is indeed golden.
 March 29, 1945
 “The hasty are ruffled; the slow and steady have composure.” One sees the truth of this every moment.
 March 30, 1945
 How dangerous it is to fall out of routine? Since coming to Bombay, I have failed to write daily. (Written on 3-4-1945.)

 Nothing can work without rules. The entire solar system would go to pieces if there were even a momentary breach of the rules governing it. (Written on 3-4-1945.)
 April 1, 1945
 This lesson is for all alike, big and small. We must learn it and act accordingly, or else die a living death.
 (Written on 3-4-1945.)
 April 2, 1945
It is sinful to multiply wants unnecessarily.
(Written on 3-4-1945.)
 April 3, 1945 Hartal (general strike) is being observed today for saving the
lives of those who have been condemned to the gallows. If the day’s
 programme is carried out with understanding, we shall have taken a big stride forward on the path of non-violence.
 April 4, 1945
 Man knows what his duty is, yet does not do what he knows he ought to. Why is that so?
 April 5, 1945 We shall be undone if we succumb to the psychological environment around us. The situation regarding the  Chimur prisoners
 keeps changing from day to  day. Let us  do  our  duty  and  remain
detached.
 April 6, 1945
 What a high degree of non-violence is needed to bear patiently with a person who is bent on misunderstanding even the simplest thing!
 April 7, 1945
 I strive hard to preserve my physical body. Do I take the same pains to know my soul?
 April 8, 1945 When there is misunderstanding I become angry, I weep,  I laugh, I feel pity. But instead of this, is it not my duty to keep calm
and try to remove the misunderstanding.
 April 9, 1945
 What shall we believe? Praise of us or censure of us? Both may be undeserved. Then, shall we be our own judges? Here too there is room enough for error. God alone knows what we are, but He does not tell us. It is, therefore, best neither to seek to know nor believe anything about ourselves. We are what we are. Nothing is to be gained by knowing or believing what we are. Performance of duty is the only thing that really matters.
 April 10, 1945
 Blind is not he who has lost his eyes, but he who hides his shortcomings.
 April 11, 1945
 Man’s serenity of mind can be tested only in the world of men,
 not on the solitary heights of the Himalayas.
 April 12, 1945
An ideal is one thing; living up to it is quite another.
 (Written on 15-4-1945.)
 April 13, 1945
A man without an ideal is like a ship without a rudder.
 (Written on 15-4-1945.)
 April 14, 1945
 I may be said to have an ideal only when I put forth an effort to realize it.
(Written on 15-4-1945.)
 April 15, 1945 We may rest content with trying, provided we make the right  effort and to the best of our ability. The result does not depend on the
effort alone. There are other factors over which we have no control.
 April 16, 1945 What shall be called the right effort? One test is that very often it yields the desired result. So the rightness is judged by the result. But
experience shows that this is not always the case. Right effort is that in
 which there is deep conviction about the correctness of the means employed, so much so that, even in the face of contrary results, the means do not change, nor does the effort vary or slacken.
 April 17, 1945 What shall be called “the best of our ability”? That effort in which we spend all our energy without stint. Success generally attends
 such pure effort.
 April 18, 1945
 Man reaches decisions on the strength of insignificant evidence and shapes his course of action accordingly. Where such is the case, it is better not to reach a decision as far as possible and to be indifferent as regards the results. But should it become a duty to take a decision, it should be taken with the greatest possible care and should be fearlessly implemented.
 April 19, 1945
 An important matter loses importance if irrelevant. A relevant thing, though small, is of the highest importance.
 April 20, 1945
 Man’s avarice reaches up to the highest heavens and down to the lowest regions of the earth. Hence, it should be controlled.
 MAHABALESHWAR,
 April 21, 1945
 Man’s joy knows no bounds when  he  obtains  something beyond his hopes.
 April 22, 1945
 There is surely something wrong with a person who is supposed to be highly spiritual and yet is always physically ailing.
 April 23, 1945
 If we think how enormous is the amount of work we have to do, we shall panic and accomplish nothing. Whereas, if we coolly get to grips with it, we shall find that even a mountain of work becomes easier day by day and is ultimately completed.
 April 24, 1945 We do not wish to see our own faults, but take delight in perceiving the faults of others. Much unhappiness arises from this
habit.

How can you 	give it up now, especially when you are confronted with obstacles?  	I intend to stay here up to the end of May and after that one month 	in Panchgani. Whether or not I will be able to do so, rests with 	God. I feel better.  	I should be happy if Vasumatilibtech_314_footnotestayed on there. It will be good if she settles down 	somewhere.  	What Badshah Khanlibtech_315_footnotesays 	is partially true. You went to Samau of your own accord, though it 	is true that I approved of your decision.  	I would also approve of your going to the Frontier Province— 	probably, even more—but only on condition that you desired to go 	there. Now I would not even induce you. You yourself, therefore,     
 should write to Badshah Khan and tell him that you would be  betraying your dharma, if you were to leave Samau. If you had not settled down to work there, you would have gone to the Frontier Province. If you could train somebody for the Samau work, I should certainly like you to go to the Frontier Province. Just now, as you know, I am trying to persuade Zohralibtech_316_footnotelibtech_317_footnoteto Join you.
 Write another letter to Badshah Khan. One to Vasumati and one to him.

 BHA I APP A,
 It is good you have sent an account of the satyagraha. Harijan brethren seem to have displayed considerable forbearance and courage. I see the conditions were favourable. That the people’s support too was forthcoming is a good sign. Much remains to be done to make this success an enduring one. In order to  retain  public support Harijan men and women will have to go a long way in purity and cleanliness. It is not right to argue that others are not pure and clean. Harijan brethren have to go against the current and should therefore develop the necessary strength.
 Make use of this in whatever way you like, so that I need not write again.

 I have your letter. You place reliance on me which, at the present moment, is not right. One does not even know whether or not I shall recover. I hope to live for 125 years but there are many obstacles in the way. Even supposing I survived, it seems to me I shall only be an adviser. It is true that if the Congress comes into power, I will suggest changes in the field of education. However, your duty is clear. Your work is to persuade your colleagues and go ahead. That iswhy I sent Narahari’slibtech_318_footnotelibtech_319_footnoteletter to you. You will have to be cautious, if he holds a different view. The essence of democracy is that  one  must  move taking along one’s colleagues. My help will be limited to using my infIuence. I can render that help only if I am in Ahmedabad and listen to all the discussions. Sitting here I can only write letters such as this.
 Do you realize my limitations? Keep on writing to me as long as you do not.

430,,LETTER TO MUNNALAL G. SHAH,"
  
 MAHABALESHWAR,
 April 26 1945
 CHI . MUN NALAL ,
 I got your three letters together. I have observed that when you write so many letters at once, you are agitated. It is so this time, too. Why is that? You are agitated when I am in the Ashram and also when   I am not. Maybe, the nature of your agitation is different in the two cases, but the effect on your health is the same. This shows that your unhappiness springs from within, and that its supposed externalcauses are nothing but imagination. How can it be that your old co-workers themselves harass you? The harassment is imagined. Differences of opinion do not constitute harassment. What is the use of my ordering you? After all it is with your co-workers that you have to work and you must, therefore, work in harmony with them. This is what is meant by public opinion, “democracy”. Work of this nature can be done only by accepting the majority opinion or the decision of the person who has been selected as the leader. Why should one feel unhappy about this, or think that one’s self-respect is being offended? This is the only way of serving other people—not in the manner we like, but in the manner that they desire. Only if you do this cheerfully you will gain wisdom, rise higher and do the utmost possible service. My  advice, therefore, is that you should remain there and go on working patiently and cheerfully. I should, of course, like you to deal with the so-called servants as you would with your own brothers and sisters. That will bring credit to you, and if you succeed, the results will be excellent. Servants have always been with us in their capacity as
 servants. The only difference is that now we wish to draw them nearer to us and give some time to them. If you do not show discretion in this, you will fail. But even if you fail, what does it matter? Success lies hidden in failure. He who fails will one day succeed. One who does nothing for fear of failing will achieve nothing. If you start re-counting from the point where you went wrong, you will get the figure right.
 By losing yourself you will gain yourself. One becomes oneself only if one ceases to be oneself. Why, then, need you fear losing your individuality? Let it be lost.
 I  had a letter from  Kanchanlibtech_343_footnotelibtech_344_footnotetoday, which I  am sending for your perusal. Let her stay where she is. She will get trained there. Amtussalaam also mentions her in her letter. I am, therefore, sending that too.
 I tear up your letters. You should never preserve your letters. They contain your sarcasms on the impulse of the moment. There is no point in re-reading or recalling them.
 All of you have been kept fully informed about ourselves. We shall be here up to the end of May, then June in Panchgani and then Sevagram. This is my intention. Only His will be done. Our hosts here  are  PremliIabehnlibtech_345_footnoteand Shantikumarlibtech_346_footnote, and  in  Panchgani  it  will beNanji Shethlibtech_347_footnote. In addition, Bachchharajbhailibtech_348_footnoteis of course at both the places.

 I 	got your letter. Chi.	likes what you have done. You need not,  	therefore, think about it any more. I examined your doings not as 	those of a near relation, but as an educated woman’s.

I 	did like, of course, your marrying outside the caste. That neither   	  nor  	you treated the childhood marriage as marriage seems altogether 	improper.     seems to be a very good man.

 I have made the corrections which occurred to me. Observe them. I don’t wish to think more. Bombay also is all right. Kaniya’slibtech_369_footnotename is in connection with Bombay. It means that he will have to stay in Bombay for those months. I shall not object. Think over it, both of you. He will acquit himself well wherever he is.

 CHI . NAR ANDAS ,
 I   like   the   schemelibtech_370_footnotelibtech_371_footnote.   There   are   two   tests   in   it—of    yarn contribution and pice contribution. In both what  matters  is  the number of donors. Yarn is a source of strength, as is evident from the very saying: “Many threads mean strength.” One thread of yarn may snap, but a rope made up of many threads would pull much heavier weight depending on the number of threads...libtech_372_footnotelibtech_373_footnoteTherefore yarn, from a single individual, however much it may be, is of no consequence. There will be many who will be ready to give more than seventy-six pice... It is good that you have decided not to accept more. Similarly [even less than that]libtech_374_footnotelibtech_375_footnotecannot be accepted. Otherwise the account will not be clear. Only a little .... There are millions in this poor country who can offer no more than a pie. There are also likely to be millions who
 
 do not have even one pie. Those of them who are eager to contribute may offer 76 pice in the name of one of them as their representative. Similarly a family may contribute 76 pice for each member. Even after saying all this, I would say that my preference is for the yarn.

447,"April 	27, 1945",LETTER TO MANIBEHN PATEL,"
            CHI 	. MAN I,     MAHABALESHWAR,  April 	27, 1945 
  	I got your letter. Immediately after reading it, I tore it up. It 	had been kept aside by mistake, but it came to me as soon as it was 	discovered that it was personal.  	But what is there so personal in what you have written? I myself 	opened it just to respect your wishes and to reassure you and will 	post this in the same way.  	As for fasts, perhaps I must have undertaken more of them than 	anyone else in the group. In South Africa I used to fast on any 	pretext. I must have taken only one meal a day for more than a year. 	But I am of the opinion that moderation in eating is more difficult 	than fasting. Fasts have a place in our life but the death of a 	relative is certainly not an occasion for them. Why  shouldn’t  	they  be undertaken on the occasion of birth? I have done that also 	but gave that up on further reflection. From this you can judge your 	fasts.libtech_376_footnoteThe 	human body is the temple of God, and should be taken care of as 	such.  	It is not that I do not know of your regular habits. Motilaljilibtech_377_footnotegave you first rank in that. But you should be 	charitable to co-workers. You fail in your duty to your neighbours 	because you are not so. Moreover you admit your shortcomings. People 	admit their short- comings either because they wish to stick to them 	or wish to cure themselves of them. Don’t you wish to get rid of 	your shortcomings? You should infect others with your regularity and 	at the same time must preserve yours. You should act as I do and 	keep your own     
 surroundings clean. Didn’t you learn this much even after being so many times in jail? What have you learnt from Mahadevlibtech_378_footnote?  Did  you observe his generosity?
 This should be more than enough for you. If all your questions have been answered, come over here. But do not come simply to please me. Come only if you feel that it is your dharma to do so, and with a charitable heart or with the aim of making it generous. If you are resentful, what will you gain by coming here? Let us magnify the molehills of our faults into mountains and see  the  mountains of others’ faults as molehills. Only then can we live in harmony.
 If you decide not to keep back anything from others, make a copy of this letter and send it to me. It is worth pondering over by many.

Hindi is a language which 	Hindus and Muslims speak and is written in the Nagari or Urdu 	script. If that is so, you and I have to know both the scripts and 	be familiar with the vocabulary of both. That being the case, you 	have to revive the Urdu script and always keep in touch with it. 	Besides, in order to remove the feeling of hostility you should join 	the Hindustani Prachar Sabha.

 MAHABALESHWAR,
 April 27, 1945
 Gandhiji said that India and Lanka were one, the latter being a pendant of a long chain which was India.
 He said that he had felt that people in Lanka sought to be separated from India, although the culture and problems of both were similar. He was glad, however, to learn that there were people in Lanka who realized this unity. Such people, he added, needed no message from him. They have only to understand the message of the charkha, khadi and the constructive programme, including village uplift and fostering of a national language. He referred to his tour of Ceylon 15 years agolibtech_394_footnoteand his embarrassment then to notice European and alien habits and customs of the people there, and wished that the Ceylonese had known more about India and the message of the charkha.

 what I had initially suggested, viz., that we should close the Ashram and everyone should settle down in different departments. This is worth seriously thinking over. Those who stay separately may  continue to do so and go on doing their work, and I would pass the rest of my life touring. This seems to me to be the best thing to do. Do not discuss this with too many people. First you yourself should think, and do what seems best to you. You need not even show this letter to anybody. You are the Chairman. You should, therefore, think independently for yourself.

 Chairman means Chimanlal. Inability to come to a decision immediately is no shortcoming, if he is otherwise able to come to a correct decision and express his view in time. Chimanlal is the Chairman because he is the most qualified of all. But the inmates of the Ashram have a right to appoint another person as Chairman. Decide first on who are Ashram inmates.
 If you think it beyond your capacity, the question of majority vote, or for that matter even of one vote, does not arise. If all the inmates regard themselves as incapable of running the kitchen, thejoint kitchen should be closed. In that case everybody will have to run his own kitchen. I do believe, of course, that the Ashram cannot be run in that way. It would then be something different.
 I had accepted the suggestion that you should be requested to leave. Now I withdraw it fully. Remain where you are and prosper.

 Bhai Jivanji has brought out at the right moment a collection of my writings and speeches on the subject of our national language. I have not found it possible to go through all the writings collected here but I have read the first twenty pages. I made the first speechlibtech_440_footnoteon this subject in 1917. And I hold the same views today as those expressed in the speech or thereafter from time to time. The only difference is that they are now stronger, clearer and more definite than before. Hindi and Urdu have always been inseparable to me. I have also quite freely used the word Hindustani. I am saying the same thing today that I did in the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan session at Indore in 1918. Hindustani is not Urdu but a happy amalgam of Hindi and Urdu which people in Northern India may easily understand and which may be written either in the Nagari or Urdu script. That alone is the perfect national language; all others are imperfect. For the present those who desire to learn the national language fully and not partially must learn both the scripts and know both the forms. It is a duty demanded of us by our love for the nation. Those who learn it will gain, those who do not will lose.

 are able, your work is sound and your Harijan treasury should always be adequate. A labourer is worthy of his hire. You are that labourer. So far as I am concerned, I would like you to draw the whole amount from the Kasturba Fund.

I would like you to be an example to the others in having the whole of your Kasturba staff consisting of paid women workers and males being honorary  and guiding hands to  the necessary extent only. Men’s merit will consist in being displaced by equally efficient women workers, if not better. God  has  given  us agreat chance when we are about to have a footing in the villages on a wide scale.

 I 	got your letter. It is clear.  	As regards your fasts, I suggest that you should undertake them only 	for reasons of health. You will then come to know about  yourself, 	profit from it spiritually too and be emancipated from superstition 	or insincerity. It is quite absurd to think that we should at least 	fast in memory of Ba or Mahadev if we cannot do anything more. They 	would surely be distressed at this if they could know about it. When 	we lose a dear one, we should do something difficult and at the same 	time dear to them. We might cultivate a sweetness of temper like 	Mahadev’s or faith like Ba’s. I have cited these as two 	illustrations which readily come to my mind. We can think of more. 	If only we realize that the body is the temple of God, or rather the 	instrument of God-realization, all will be well with us. Then the 	fraud which now passes for religion will cease. I take all this 	trouble to explain things to you because you are simple in habits 	and have resisted many temptations. I know that you would be able to 	achieve much more if you could rise higher in all respects.  	And that is why I wish to draw you here or to the Ashram. Father too 	feels that way, and that makes me all the more eager to attract you. 	If Father was out of prison neither you nor I would desire that even 	for a single moment you should be anywhere else but by his side. If 	you are near me, you will grow in tolerance, for this is a place 	where one has to cultivate detachment in spite of having to adjust 	oneself to different temperaments. This means that we should always 	be ready to learn from others. We should observe people, emulate 	their virtues and bear with their weaknesses for that is the best 	way of curing them. And, therefore, come soon.  	You did well to give me news of Nandubehn, Diwan Masterlibtech_467_footnoteand [Dr.] Kanuga.        
 It is nearly morning now and I am about to put out the light. I will, therefore, stop here.

 Mr. D. N. Balavenkataram, former President of the Salem Taluka Congress Committee, asked Gandhiji whether the Press reports that he would not think of entering the temple of Mahabaleshwar as long as they were not open to the Harijans were correct. Mahatma Gandhi remarked:
Yes, the Press reports are true. As long as the doors of the
temples are not open to the Harijans, I shall never enter them.
 Replying to a question whether a visitor should go on a fast unto death to see that the temples were open to the Harijans, Gandhiji said:
 No. That would be an act of violence.
 Asked when a fast was violent and when it could be construed as non- violent, Gandhiji replied that it would depend on the circumstances of each case.

527,"May 4, 1945",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
  
 MAHABALESHWAR,
 May 4, 1945
 These are the remarks attributed to Sir Firoz Khan  Noonlibtech_482_footnoteas having been made by him at San Francisco.
 Sir Firoz Khan Noon claimed that while the Japanese were overrunning Burma and heading towards India, the agents of Mahatma Gandhi’s party severely damaged or destroyed 332 railway stations and 945 post offices. He also alleged that Gandhiji himself encouraged disobedience because “he was convinced that Britain had been defeated and he did not want to displease the Japanese. Gandhiji is in the hands of the reactionary and orthodox Hindus. He would be doing a great service to the country if, at this moment, he were to retire in favour of a younger man. I feel Nehru would be an excellent successor to Gandhi. He has quite a large support among the Muslims and is not so bigoted as Gandhi, who is at a dead-end. The only solution is for Nehru to come   to the forefront. But Nehru respects Gandhi so much that he would not come forward.”
 Assuming their authenticity, I beg to offer  the  following remarks:
 Time was when I was considered by the British rulers as pro-Japanese, but they quietly withdrew the remark. There was not the slightest foundation for it. It comes somewhat as a surprise that Sir Firoz should make such a statement at this juncture. It may interest him to know that even when the British had suffered severe reverses, I told the masses that the British were fighters who were never dismayed by defeats, delighted in bungling and never learned except by making and even repeating mistakes.
 I commend my writings before the August of 1942 to Sir Firoz. He will find in them my answerlibtech_483_footnoteto the Congress Responsibility for  the Disturbances, 1942-43. I stood for unadulterated Indianindependence and, therefore, could not afford to be lukewarm about Japanese or any other Power’s success against the British. My purpose was to end British or any other foreign rule in India as a whole through non- violent non-co-operation and civil resistance.
 
 I had never any party of mine in the Congress. I ceased to be its member from December 1934. Whenever my services were needed by the Congress, it had every right to call me in for my special training in non-violent resistance. Neither the Congress nor I had anything to do with civil or other resistance in and after August 1942. I alone was armed with authority to start it when in my opinion the time for it came. But I was arrested before I could take any action or even issue any instructions. Therefore neither the Congress nor I could  be saddled with any responsibility for the disturbances of 1942. Apart from that fact, the figures quoted by Sir Firoz are utterly unproved, the Government, though often challenged, never having taken the trouble to prove before a competent court of law the charges made by them with surprising lavishness.
 Next, I come to Sir Firoz’s statement about Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and me. He should know that I have called the Pandit my successor. He does not need to come to the front. He is in the front. The Government of India would not let him work as he would. He and I are friends. But we are no rivals. We are both servants of the people and the platform of service is as big as the world. It is never overcrowded. On it, there is always room for more, and as on the point of independence we have no differences, we are always brothers in arms. He has undoubtedly the advantage of youth over me.
 Let Sir Firoz ask his Government, on pain of resignation, to release Pandit Nehru and his fellow-prisoners, and he will see his wish fulfilled. I shall give him my hearty co-operation in its fulfilment.
 Let him make no capital out of my supposed bigotry or orthodoxy. He may not know that I have never been a bigot or known as such since my youth. And orthodoxy would not have me for my uncompromising and radical attitude on untouchability and general social reform. Sir Firoz is on safer ground when he accuses me of being out of date. For no one knows what or who is out of date. I confess my ignorance on the point.libtech_484_footnote
 
 I notice too a remark made that “the Cripps Mission would have had a greater chance of success, if Mr. Gandhi had not interfered at the last stage”. It is astonishing how a lie, once it gets a start, persists. I left Delhi long before the Mission had commenced its talks with the Working Committee. I then ceased to interest myself in the Mission, having more important work on hand.

  	If you understand individual self-reliance, you  should understand 	the self-reliance of a society or an institution. If an individual 	believes that he will get his bread if he puts in earnest labour, 	then the same is true of an institution. That is to say, if it 	renders service, it will get bread without asking, meaning thereby 	that it will get the money to meet its expenses. In fact, it should 	get the money from its neighbours. If it does not get it, then it 	should realize that no one cares for its services. Such a thing can 	happen while dispelling ignorance in a land of blind faith. Then the 	expenses will be borne by the reformers. The same rule will apply 	here too. The reformers in the beginning will starve, a few of them 	will even die. We must have faith that God will sustain them in some 	way or other. If you don’t fully understand this, we shall discuss 	it. We won’t  go further than that. I will discuss it only if you 	want it.

549,"May 6, 1945",LETTER TO NARAHARI D. PARIKH,"
  
 Not revised	May 6, 1945
 
 CHI. NARAHARI,
 I have gone through your book Kanyane Patro. The letters  seem to have been written with great care but you have not been bold enough.
 Your views about mixed marriages are not expressed clearly. Since I believe that we cannot have too many of such marriages, I do not at all approve of marriages within the same caste. I do not find you advocating mixed marriages on an extensive scale even within the same province. You accept inter-provincial marriages only as exceptions. I would encourage them and they ought to be encouraged. Reformists, being indifferent to religion, may do that, but their example will have no effect. We, however, who keep religion in the forefront should make up our minds how far we are prepared to go. If Hindustani becomes the national language and castes and sub-castes as we know them disappear—as they should—we should unhesitatingly accord the highest importance to marriages between Ati-Sudras and caste-Hindus. The question of provincial boundaries will not even arise then. Where parents are wise, there should be no difficulty even about marriages between persons of different religions.
 Do we not look upon all religions as equal? It is with some purpose that we have accorded a place to other faiths in our prayer. The offspring may choose either religion. The couple of our conception will give the children liberal education in that regard. In my view this should be quite easy. In ‘letters addressed to a girl’, such things  should be stated firmly and clearly.
 Mahadev’s article is a little out of focus. Vanamala’s doubt is correct. What do our Jain nuns do? And what about Swaminarayan nuns? It will produce indigestion in the children if we give them so much from English literature. Comparisons should be made only between equals. Our culture is free from the extremes of Western culture. We may know that culture after we have grown up and compare it with ours. Growing children should first understand and assimilate their own heritage. But I will not make this too long.
 I was forgetting one point. You have written with people of our category in view, i. e., the upper three castes, and even among them Brahmins and Banias. What about Rajputs? And Sudras? Also Ati-Sudras? They permit divorce and remarriage. There are also communities among whom there is no such thing as marriage ceremony. Even then purity is observed. This thing must  be mentioned.
 Accept from this only what you can assimilate. This will give you a glimpse of my latest thinking. This is an important letter. Make a copy for record in the office or ask Hemantkumar to make one.

 MAHABALESHWAR,
 May 6, 1945
 What do you think of the future plans now being made by the Government to dispose of Indian industries under high-sounding phrases, through the nationalist-minded Sir Ardeshir Dalallibtech_504_footnoteand through the visit of  capitalists reported to be presently despatched unofficially to America and England, under the auspices of the Government of India?
This question has been put to me.
 Nothing said by those outside the Government ring seems to matter. They have come to know that the best of us will speak loud and give it the lie by our action. Big merchants, capitalists,  industrialists and others speak and write against the Government, but in action do its will and even profit—through it—though the profit may amount to, say, five per cent against the Government’s 95. Circumstances alone may be to blame for the condition in which the country has been weltering since the advent of British commerce backed by British guns.
 The bright spot in the situation, however, is that all the big interests proclaim with one voice that India wants nothing less than her own elected national government to shape her own destiny free of all control, British or other. This independence will not come for the asking. It will come only when the interests, big or small, are prepared to forgo the crumbs that fall to them from partnership with the British in the loot which British rule takes from India. Verbal protests will count for nothing so long as the partnership continues unchecked.
 The so-called unofficial deputation, which the protestants fear, will go to England and America, dare not proceed, whether for inspection or for entering into a shameful deal, so long as the moving spirits of the Working Committee are being detained without any trial for the sole crime of sincerely striving for India’s independence without shedding a drop of blood save their own.

Democracy need not be dismissed wholesale. It is based on ahimsa. 	There is profound truth in the saying “The voice of the Panch 	is the voice of God”. But the Panch should be 	worshipper of God.

 I understand about Kanchan. Let her move towards self- perfection in the way she wants. If she is discontented, nobody will be able to stop her, neither you nor I. How, then, can Amtussalaam?
 If we wait till the hearts of all become one, we shall have to go waiting for ever. We should follow the dictum “The whole world is good if we ourselves are good” and try our utmost to live in harmony with everybody.
 I know Hiramani very well. I should certainly like it if she were to come and stay in the Ashram and get experience. When she wants to marry, she will find the man. But why need she think aboutthat at all? She is a girl who wants to be useful and can be useful in many ways. She may write to me if she wishes.

 Tagore is not only unquestionably the Poet of India or of Asia, but of the whole world. It has become the custom among us topay homage to the memory of the great dead not by observing the day of the death anniversary but by observing their birthday. The simple reason, perhaps, is that they never die with the dissolution of their bodies. Their memory becomes immortal in their works. Rama and Krishna were avatars. We celebrate their birthdays. Similarly, though Gurudev is no longer in flesh among us he will continue to live through his immortal poetry. The memory of the  Poet  will  grow richer as years roll by.

 BHAI MUSHTAQ AHMED,
 I have your letter of the 2nd instant. The replies to your questions are given below:
 Communal 	representation is in 	itself bad.  No 	one today has 	the right to 	enrol members 	for  the 	Congress. 
 The committees you mention have not been formed constitutionally. They just set themselves up. Everyone can therefore refuse to recognize them.
  So 	far as 	I am 	aware there are 	no restrictions 	in this 	regard laid down in 	the Congress 	Constitution. Even a 	hooligan can 	enter the 	Congress. Yes, 	provided, they sincerely work for the Congress. 
 The above answers should be considered tentative. They represent my personal view. From a legal angle my view could be wrong and, even if it was not, it could be rejected for the simple reason that I do not possess any authority. You may therefore assume that it is not to be taken into account.

  	Pandit Sunderlal is here. It is good he came. I have had talk with 	him. AS a consequence we all feel that there is a danger of being 	misled if the committee functions at Allahabad. Panditji said that 	those working on the Boardlibtech_546_footnotelibtech_547_footnotewill 	be afraid of going to Wardha and may refuse to go there. The 	implications of this are obnoxious. The Sabha was born in Wardha. It 	functioned in Wardha. The work on thedictionary should be carried on 	in Wardha and, if I am to do this work and supervise the dictionary, 	the office of the Board should be in Wardha. There will be nothing 	to worry about if, for the sake of convenience, some work is done in 	Allahabad. A building was constructed in Wardha for this work. 	Kakasaheb’s place is in Wardha.  I am, therefore, of the firm 	opinion that the headquarters of the Dictionary Board should be in 	Wardha. If Akhtar works for us he should stay in Wardha. It will be 	all right if your own share of work is for the most part sent on to 	you in Allahabad. From this point of view, consideration of 	expenditure becomes secondary. We should  now make public the names 	of the members of the Board we have decided to form, shouldn’t we? 	Panditji is writing to the persons concerned. We have to have 	someone take the final decision about the work and then get it 	approved by the executive committee. Isn’t that so? According to 	the rules it should be like that. Let me know your opinion. I am 	here and in Panchgani till the end of June.  	Panditji is of the opinion that I should be the constitutional head 	of the Board.

 I have your letter. What you write about Purushottam is right. A man belonging to the Urdu Anjuman can also belong to our organization, can’t he? Therefore those working for the Hindi Sammelan can also work for us. I should maintain that policy as long as I am associated with the Sammelan work. However, if that is against the policy of the Sammelan then I must leave. I am considering this.
Please welcome Kosambi on my behalf.
 I am in correspondence with Dr. Tarachand.libtech_549_footnoteWe have formed a special committee at Wardha, haven’t we? We shall do everything after consulting it and the General Body, shall we not?
 My views on the future activities of the Vidyapith are as follows. We must start implementing the ideas I have expressed on Nayee Talim. That covers everything. So there will be a revolutionary change in the existing schemes of the Vidyapiths. The entire structure will change. However, these changes won’t be effected artificially. Whatever you wish to take from my speeches or discussions should be acted upon. Can you understand from this what I have in mind? Come  to Panchgani if you want to know more.
 It is your duty to persuade Narahari and take him with you. You will have to take many in this way. That is what is called institution ethics. If that is not done only individual work will be done. Now I have replied to all your questions.

RAJAGOPALACHARIlibtech_554_footnote","
       MAHABALESHWAR,  May [11/]libtech_555_footnotelibtech_556_footnote12, 1945  RAJAGOPALACHARI: 	The people, 	who are 	now saying they 	are doing 	your constructive 	work, are really 	parliamentarians but only 	one branch 	of it and they 	seek power through your 	unofficial influence, whereas other parliamentarians are 	seeking it 	through constitutional 	channels. On the 	other hand, the 	only man 	who understands and 	can do your constructive work is myself.  GANDHIJI: 	Yes.  Are 	you thinking of dividing Congress work into functions?  	I am not thinking of division of functions. But there is a natural 	division. But I have not thought (of)libtech_557_footnotecompartments lower and higher.  It 	is like varna 	vyavastha.  	Horizontal, never vertical. But my conception certainly is that we 	can come to our own if all take up constructive work.  Parliamentary 	work will help constructive work. But (constructive) work need      
 not necessarily be our whole care.
 It replaces armed activity. But we can never come to our own through parliamentary activity (alone).
 If, on the one hand, no one outside can act on behalf of the Congress and, on the other, the British Government will not release the Working Committee members unless a basis of reconciliation has been authoritatively agreed to, there is an insoluble tangle. Someone must some time or other act on behalf of the Congress and accept a scheme of settlement and, as a part of that scheme, the prisoners must be released. You must, therefore, act on behalf of the Congress. You know you are competent to do it. You say that every Congressman may act on his own authority as  if he were president. But this is chaos. Suppose now, there are a number of president-candidates, the best man must win. That is you. The man who is in fact the best man to take up authority should take up responsibility at some time. There is no use asking others to negotiate without committing the Congress. There is no force behind Bhulabhai’slibtech_558_footnoteefforts because you have not givenlibtech_559_footnoteopen and  unreserved approval to his proposals. It is only if you take up the authority like a dictator, can reasonable scheme of settlement have success. You must take up authority on behalf of the Congress some time.
That point may be reached some time, but not now.
 It may be that parliamentary activity will advance constructive work and that will help.
Then you hold my view or I yours.libtech_560_footnote
 As Churchill (was it Prittlibtech_561_footnote?) has said, the courts are not beyond political influence. This he said some years ago about Judge Granville over a heated political case involving judicial points. In my case (in South Africa) it was a franchise question. I lost because it was political. I had engaged Asquith.libtech_562_footnote
If Colvillelibtech_563_footnotelibtech_564_footnote(the Governor of   Bombay)  means  it,  he  can  say,
 
 sincerity”. Vide also “Silence day Note to Bhulabhai Desai”, 11-6-1945.
 ‘withdraw legal proceedings and exercise clemency.’ I have done all these things in South Africa once through Hertzoglibtech_565_footnote. Clemancy has now a greater chance of success. Let us hope that Bhulabhai is on the qui vive. I don’t mind if the examination is started. libtech_566_footnoteI simply feel
 that we shall have to go through these things, if the rulers are bent on crushing us. The difference between you and me is not great, but (it is) vital though (it seems) small. You want, if you do, power at any price. I have put a limit to the price to be paid. You think if you do that nothing will come if we don’t take power. I say, I can afford to wait till it comes at my price, for I am making progress however slight it may be. libtech_567_footnote
 If you feel like talking about any other thing, I am prepared and will gladly set apart the time. I simply do not worry you for I have nothing to ask. Your presence gives me solace and strength. What more do I want? I understand you and you me.

  	Your handwriting is good. The letters are clear but too small. 	Cultivate the habit of writing a bigger hand.

This will not imply any responsibility 	for running the Ashram. The expenditure will be the responsibility 	of the Secretary. You should look after the accounts. You may take 	it easy the rest of the time.  	“Who 	would practise the 	difficult vows of 	 yama, 	niyama, shama and 	dama which even the minds of seers cannot grasp?” 	This is easy          
 to sing but difficult to practise, as the poet says. Doesn’t  agamalibtech_573_footnotein the line stand for  agamyalibtech_574_footnote? Self-discipline embraces the whole life. How can a man who has achieved freedom from desire or control of desire suffer from any disease or any laxity? Think over this. The responsibility of running the Ashram should be borne by Munnalal and Krishnachandra by turns. Make a list of the jobs to be attended to by them. Other things should be looked after by Jajujilibtech_575_footnoteThe Ashram should not be closed, nor should its name be changed. If you don’t want to leave the Ashram, I shall not make you do so. One can work according to one’s ability, but ability may either increase or decrease. You should see to it that yours increases.
I understand about ice [doctor].

 Balkrishna has done the correct thing. Does it not mean that the vaidya’s medicine did not give permanent relief? If he is inclined that way, why must he wait for my also being so inclined? Dr. Kelkar’s treatment after all will do no harm. Keep me informed about the effect of the treatment.
 You have done well about Sanskrit. Learn the grammar properly.   Let   Balkrishna   also   study   Grimm’s   lawlibtech_583_footnotelibtech_584_footnote.   It   will   help considerably. Learning of the script will also become easy if it is kept in mind.
 It is good to study the science of khadi. Do not do any reading while walking. Only think. Do not strain your eyes. Vinoba’s dis- courses are good. Since you have learnt the art of reading newspapers, 45 minutes is not too much. Understand where this art lies.
Do as much carding as is necessary for making slivers.
 I forgot about weaving. See both the spinning and the weaving in the Nagpur Mill. Observe both these processes at Savli where too they are carried on.
 It is all right to meet at night, but not for discussion. Work in silence. Or everyone may read what they like in silence. The thing is that in spite of diversity of opinions all are working on the same thing. It is your duty to give your whole-hearted co-operation in that work.
 The lines in the hand are not without significance. But do not get caught in palmistry.
 Urdu diction is used by Muslims in writing. Hindi diction is used by Sanskrit pundits. Hindustani is the sweet mingling of the two.

  	I see from your letter that you think it would be good if I took 	only milk. I tried that too but lost weight immediately. I consider 	it a crime to take fruit, or leafy vegetables or anything just for 	the taste. However, if one finds taste in what one ought to eat, I 	won’t reject it. For the present things are being discussed purely 	from the medical point of view. I have seen no book recommending 	giving up of leafy vegetables and fruit. It will be a great gain if 	what you say is true. It 	will be a great thing if Hari-ichchha is cured.  	I hear that you have started Balkrishna’s treatment. May you be 	successful.

 MAHABALESHWAR,
 [Before May 13, 1945]libtech_595_footnote
 DEAR  IFTIKHAR libtech_596_footnote,
 Give up the habit of writing and speaking in English, if you want to be free.
 I have read your letter. It is my view that no one has the right to speak in the name of the Congress, not even members of the All-India Working Committee who are out of jail. They can do so only when the whole Committee is out. Neither you nor anyone else has the right to work in the name of the Congress. This does not mean that you should sit idle and not exercise your influence. Nobody can deprive you of your individual position. The same applies to members of the Congress Workers’ Assembly. Everyone is his own leader. Everyone is free to lead those who follow him. This to my mind is the constitutional posi-tion. Let no one therefore use my name. I have not issued any circular.libtech_597_footnoteWhat was attributed to me must have been taken from an opinion expressed in a letter I wrote to someone in Ahmedabad. All that it meant was that no one can issue orders in the name of the Congress.
 Now as regards your restrictions. So long as you do not regard yourself  under  control  of the  Government,  whatever  you   wrote  (in reply to the restriction order) was correct. We must never yield.
 Blessings to you bothlibtech_598_footnotefrom

 there. You must shape things there. Thambi must have many admirers besides you and me. I am glad about Mrs. Naidoo. What is she doing? What about his children? Could you send me a photo of the family with Thambi in it?

 The enclosed is from your paper. I feel that an advertisement which is immoral or is against the recognized or declared policy of the management should never be accepted. No registered bhandar can sell khadi without yarn being tendered. It should not escape your notice. Therefore you should not accept this advertisement. You should outright refuse this person. For doing so you must impose restrictions on advertisements. That involves some sacrifice and some scrutiny. However, in the long run, you won’t lose anything but if you do it, it will be nothing more than the dirt on your palmslibtech_610_footnote. Do lose it.

  	I read your letter just now. They handed it to me  without opening 	it. But I am going to give it to Narahari, Pyarelal, Munnalal and 	Hemantkumar to read. That letter is a mirror of your soul.  	You have always been, and still are, silly. Remember the verse: 	“Dwelling in thought on vishayas.” libtech_613_footnoteHere vishaya does not mean merely what it does 	in Gujarati, namely, immoral sex-pleasure. All objects of desire are 	vishayas, as for example, desiring what appeals to the eye, 	hearing with the ear, smelling with the nose, andother similar 	objects of sense. Your object of desire is to come to the hills. If 	it didn’t materialize you should forget about it. But you would 	not be Lili if you could forget anything. And that is why you 	suffer. Otherwise there are few other women as fortunate as you. 	Though married in the prime of your youth, you have remained a 	virgin all these years so that all the desire in you for that 	momentary pleasure has been burnt away. You like service and get 	opportunities for it. The best service you rendered was to Bhansali, 	then to Ramprasad and then to Krishnachandra. I will not consider 	your services to Ba, Mahadev     
 and myself as there was attachment in that.
 You are educating yourself to be a doctor entirely with the aim of dedicating yourself to public service. What purer happiness than this could one have? If you are still discontented, does it not mean that you are silly?
 Hoshiari wishes to come to me, and so does Vina. And there is no limit to the number of men who wish to come. If they cannot come, does it mean that they are unfortunate? You should completely burn up this desire of yours. Hence, though from one point of view your letter is good, from another point of view it is one that you should withdraw, and that too, cheerfully. You must pass, and do so with credit. Afterwards you will be serving to your heart’s content. And you do get opportunities from time to time, such as serving uncle. Sushila is there. Pyarelal is leaving tomorrow.

 I know you refrained from coming so as to save me trouble. I will lovingly use the tumblers when they arrive. You and Priyamvada have asked for my blessings for Mohandas and his bride. My fear is, theirs may not be an inter-caste marriage. Has the bride given up purdah? Will both of them give themselves up to service? Will Priyamvada keep the bride engaged in household work or give her time to do work of service? I hope the bride’s parents do not keep her like a slave. If you can give satisfactory replies to all these questions, then here are heaps of blessings for the bride and birdegroom.

  	I was going to write to you in Hindustani but for this letter at 	least I restrain myself. For the future I shall do as you will bid. I 	had thought that Dr. Jayakar and Kumar Saheb had come to 
 me on your behalf and at your instance. Rajaji told me otherwise. Hence this note, though belated.
 I considered the whole of your report as sketched to me to be an able document. But I did not interest myself in the whole of it. My interest was naturally confined to the communal question and it was wholly satisfactory. I hope you do not want me to express  any opinion on the rest.
 You have, and that at your age, laboured at the report and laboured with your colleagues as few men would have done. Rajaji has told me much about this part of your valuable work. And in Santanam you have an able and painstaking secretary.
 Hope you are keeping well and that your ailing son has  recovered completely.

 I have your letter. I hope you have a place to stay in Bombay. Go to Bombay. There is a Nature Cure Clinic ill Malad. It is owned by Dr. Krishnavarma. He will admit you. I am writing to him. Follow his instruction. You will be cured. You must also learn everything. Give whatever help you can, if your health permits. Keep me informed. Leave Wardha only with Rishabhdas’s permission. Show this postcard to Dr. Krishnavarma.

  	What I wrote to you has happened. Sailen Chatterjee is an employee 	of an insurance company. He lives on whatever he earns. I have 	advised him to go to your clinic. The doctors say he keeps getting 	well and falling ill again. He has agreed to go to you. The matter 	of expenses has to be considered. Madhavdas’s case is entirely 	different. In any case, Sailen must give something. If you run a 	free hospital, it will get filled up and no one will be benefited. 	That can be discussed when we have the time. I have written to 	Sailen to go to you and show my postcard. He lives in Wardha.

 Examine the views I have at various times expressed on varnavyavastha. If there have been changes, do let me know. I am nottaking the trouble myself because I must let people know where I stand today and be satisfied with that. If there is anything
 
 
 contradictory in the views I expressed earlier, they should not be taken into consideration. Some of what has been written is meant only to malign me. Some show a lack of understanding, some ignorance. Then again some of it is written with a view to publication and largely for money. It is immaterial whether people are convinced by my reply or not. Those, with whose criticism I have dealt, have certainly been convinced. Some would like it more if I dispensed with the distinction I have laid down in my article. But how could I do that?  Varnavyavastha will not cease to be beneficial by our not being aware of its benefits. That the meaning of varna needs to be properly understood is another question. The difference pointed out by you seems correct.
 It would certainly be good if my articles on varna, etc., are published. No omissions and additions should be made before getting them published. Even if I had the time I would make no changes. However, I would explainlibtech_634_footnotemy present stand in detail. Study them if you have the time and the will. I shall be ready to go through your work.

676,"May 20, 1945",FOREWORD TO “COW IN INDIA”,"
  
 One of the first and best pupils of the late lamented Dr. P. C. Ray, Shri Satis Chandra Das Gupta is a fit person to bring under one cover all the available literature on the cow rightly called the ‘Mother of Prosperity’. By convincing arguments based on copious reading of which he has reproduced the relevant parts in the volume, the author has dispelled the belief held even by learned men that India’s cattle are a burden upon the land and divide its production with the people to the latter’s detriment. He shows the usefulness of the cow as the giver of milk, the producer of draught-bullocks, the manurer of our fields and after death the giver of her hide and bone. He proves the superiority of cattle over the engine for ploughing the fields of India. He establishes the inevitable connection and interdependence between the cattle and other animal life, the earth and man. Lastly, he proves the superiority of the cow over the buffalo, not so that the  latter  should be killed off or starved out but so that the buffalo should not be favoured at the expense of the cow as is done at the present moment. I commend the volume to the lover of the cow as also to everyone who would learn that the slaughter of cattle for food is a pure economic waste and know how he can turn the cow into a giver of plenty instead of being the giver of scanty which, owing to criminal negligence, she has become today.
It will interest the reader to know that the author wrote the whole
 
 volume during his recent imprisonment.

681,"May 21, 1945",HOW TO IMPROVE VILLAGE INDUSTRIES,"
  
 May 21, 1945
 I have distinguished other village industries from khadi and called them planets and the charkha or the spinning-wheel the sun. As a matter of fact there is no real reason for such a distinction, for khadi is also a village industry. But it has acquired a special position, and it is because of this special position which it has acquired that we can now talk about the other village industries.
 Today we are not required to demonstrate the special position acquired by khadi but we are required to discover ways and means of putting it and other village industries on a firm footing.
 One of the ways is to resort to centralized production of necessities through machinery worked by power and requiring the minimum of human labour. This results in increasing the number of the rich few and making it a dharma to multiply the people’s wants. Even if all such centralized industries were to be State-owned, it would make no difference to me. For the obligation to increase wants will not only not decrease, but may be strengthened where such industries are owned by the State. Only the task of increasing wants will pass from the hands of small capitalists to the bigger capitalists, or the State, whose action will secure the seal of public support. This is how things are going in England and America. I am purposely leaving out Russia; because their work is still continuing, I shall not at this stage dare to assess the result. I hope that Russia will produce something unique. But I must confess that I have my doubts whether it will truly succeed. I shall consider it a great success if, through it, all the wealth really goes into the hands of the poor, and intellectual and personal freedom is at the same time secured. In that case I will have to revise my present concept of ahimsa.
 Now I come to the main point. In England and America, machinery rules supreme. On the contrary, in India we have village industries, symbolizing the resurgence of human labour. In the West, a handful of persons with the aid of mechanical power rule over others. In India, on the other hand, the great task of bringing out whatis best in every individual is being attempted by the A. I. S. A., A. I. V. I. A. and other allied institutions. From this point of view the growth of Western civilization seems to be an easy thing, but to develop a
 organize the latent capacities of individuals through village industries appears to be a very difficult task.
 Looking at it from another point of view, it may be said that, for a handful of men to rule over other men with the aid of steam and other power will be harmful in the end, as it is bound to multiply injustice. By using the human power available to us by the million, injustice is reduced. And there is no room for failure. For here, along with human power, we rely on divine Power. In the other method, no value is attached to divine Power. In short, if in the case of village industries we do not truly obtain God’s help, we are bound to fail. The Western method only appears to be successful, but in truth there is nothing but failure in it. For it destroys the will to work.

 We cannot answer the question by merely quoting Sanjana’s name. Do so only if the questions arising call for a reply. We shall lose nothing if for the time being you leave things alone.
 I have an impression that I have written to Surendraji. If he does not want to wait till I reach Wardha, he can come to Panchgani. However I should prefer Wardha. But I leave it to him to decide. Guide him. He is not going to lose anything if he spends some time in Wardha. Khadi Vidyalaya, Goshala, Village Industries and other such activities can take up considerable time.
 I should like it very much if Gomati could take some treatment. It will be better to take Chugh’s advice. Raihana writes highly about him.
I would like you not to go to Sevagram before June.

 CHI . JAI SUKHL AL,
 So Manu has returned there at last, not restored in health but broken both in body and mind. The two react on each other. She is of course responsible for the weakening of both. The atmosphere also may be responsible, but man’s strength lies in overcoming his surroundings. I could not teach this to her fully. She is consumed by fear. She herself is the cause of that fear. It has become an occupation with her to listen to others, then get upset and jumpy and start crying, and she studies only when she gets some free time from this. She is filled with the highest spirit of service, is interested in learning and is of loving nature. Like me, she also suffers from amoebiasis and hookworm. I keep the infection under control, but she does not. Do now whatever suggests itself to you as best. She can always come back to me. I will never leave her. But she is free. I trust you are all right.

But you must get rid of the amoeba 	and hook-worm. But how can you manage to do so, if you are returning 	on the 4th? In any case, do not take that vaid’s treatment. If you 	decide to stay on there, do so with a firm resolution to get rid of 	your illness. Do not be anxious to appear for the examination. If 	you can easily manage to read a little, it will be all right.  	I can see from your letter that you are consumed by the fear of the 	surrounding atmosphere. The world will always frighten those who let 	themselves be frightened. You would, therefore, do well to cast all 	fear into the sea. The best medicine for that is Ramanama. Why need 
 he who worships Rama, fear anything else? But this is only a suggestion from me. You did not regain peace of mind even after meeting your sisters. You may come whenever you wish. You need have no fear on that score.

 Why should a woman be given a different name when she goes to live with her husband and why not a man? This custom irks me very much. I think I came to know only here that your real name is Jamna.
 The reason for writing this letter is the accompanying letter. Give it to the two women if they are there or, if they have left, post it to them. Read it yourself. There is nothing private in it. You made the girls very happy. Were they of any help to you or did they merely treat themselves to the tasty food you offered them? Is it true that you pamper your guests’ palate?

 Mahatma Gandhi said that the national song which they had sung to welcome him praised ‘Bharatmata’ and struck a victorious note but the present time was not the one in which one could indulge in joyous celebrations. India was now in the same plight as Draupadi was at one time and it was a matter to be seriously considered whether that should be an occasion to celebrate. In the song they had sung,there occurred the motto “Do or Die”. That should encourage them to carry on the fight for the liberation of the motherland without rest. It was the natural duty of the young to carry on the fight for freedom but at the same time they should not allow the old to take rest.

  	I have your letter. One should not work too hard for examinations. 	One can study well only if one does not have such infatuation.

 letter. Do not send for her there. Her eyes will be harmed. Everything can be done in Delhi. If you want to go and take Usha with you, you may go. Kanam will look after himself. However, I want you not to leave Ramdas. My advice is that you should entrust Sumi to Devdas and Lakshmi. If Sumi can manage without you, let her do so. If you people go, Devdas will certainly have to bear some burden. Lakshmi is very good-natured and affectionate. But her health is delicate. She has just left childbed. It will be a different thing if you go there and take charge of cooking, etc. You will not be able to do that; so your place is in Nagpur with Ramdas. It will be enough if you can make Sumi give up her infatuation for reading. It is not through reading that one can think. What is the advantage of mere cramming? Devdas will manage. Lakshmi can also manage. The doctors in Delhi are good. It is a consolation that Sumi likes being there.
 You have to persuade Ramdas. He should continue with Mehta for a long period. That was what he decided when he was here with me. If you wish, you can win him over and make him do what you want. No one else has that power. I had it once. But not now, because I am not able to pay much attention to him. My attention has been divided these days.
 Kanam will come and see me either here or at Panchgani. I have a letter from him. I have given him the permission.
 Manilal and Devdas left yesterday. Most probably Sushila will not come to the hill station. She will come only to Sevagram.

So for the two together you may 	have to pay as much as Rs. 200, because Prabhudas will need plenty 	of milk, fruit, ghee and green vegetables. He has gone through a 	pretty hard time. In view of his state of health you will have to 	permit him to go somewhere else in extreme summer. It is possible 	that Prabhudas will agree to accept a little less. But I would  not 	consider it proper. His daughters too are sensible and, in my view, 	quite capable. So between all of them I would not consider that 	salary too high.

 I had not read the last portion carefully. But I think I have grasped the purport of the whole thing. I do not propose to answer your points. This is what I advise : We must not spend so much time in preparing questions. We must take whatever work we can with ease and be patient with regard to the rest. You do not have to move only with me. I have provided you a great institution. Now it is for you to prove your worth. You must play the main part in winning over Bapa.  I might be of help to you, but if you do not like what I do, or my method of doing it, it is difficult for me to say what you should do. Some words of yours have given me that impression. You do not like the Ashram and I have been constantly wondering how anyone who does not like the Ashram can like me. I blame myself for that. It is a case of my being liked but not my work. You alone must sit down at leisure and find a solution. But what is to be done when leisure is something you cannot afford ? How long must I go on writing like this ? A word to the wise should suffice.

 I was glad to meet you any time and so I said ‘Yes’ to Joshi. But these two questions could have been answered in two lines. My correspondence with Joshi was never confidential. In any event it can be published at once. I think I have said as much in one of my letters.  I can’t hasten Bhulabhai. I have sent him the papers I could. He could give his opinion any day he chose.libtech_682_footnotelibtech_683_footnoteMy fear is that it won’t be an award. It would be the opinion of a distinguished lawyer on the papersin my possession. But my own opinion is not formed. I want to pass no hasty judgment. Many honest Congressmen come to me or
 
 write to me from the various provinces that communists have no principles save of keeping their party alive and beating  their opponents with any stick that came to their hands. I am not going to base my opinion on this evidence either. I dare not condemn you, Batliwala, Joshi or Habib of Lucknow. He was with me for over a month I think. He came for his fatherlibtech_684_footnotelibtech_685_footnote. I like him very much, On the whole I agree with Rajaji that you should refuse to put yourself in the dock.

 All the letters received today suggest that you wish to continue as secretary. Well then, do so. But divide the responsibility and do only such work as you can wihtout having to move about. Look after the accounts and such supervisory work as you can. If anyone wishes to be the Manager, let him, and help him. A day has to come when it will be necessary for someone to be the Manager, for I must some day die and so must you. After that someone will have to become the Manager.

 How nice it would be if some treatment could do a little good to Gomati. No one has worked for twenty hours at a meeting of the trustees or elsewhere, then why should I do so? Do all the legends spread in this way? No doubt, I did plenty of work. I sat at a stretch for four hours at a meeting of the trustees. But that was enough for me. There is such a difference between four hours and twenty hours. Doctors or no doctors, I should find it impossible toe sit that long. Those days are gone.

  From 	a copy of the Gujarati: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         MAHABALESHWAR,  May 	26, 1945  	It is understood that Maj. Longden, among other things, raised the 	questions of Dominion Status v. Independence, the Hindu-Muslim 	question, responsibility for the August 1942  disturbances and 	possibility of Congress co-operation in the war effort.  	Mahatma Gandhi is said to have replied that the question of Dominion 	Status v. Independence could be decided after the principle of 	independence for India had been accepted by the British Government.  	On the Hindu-Muslim question, Mahatma Gandhi is understood to have 	said that Hindus who had been converted to Islam could not claim 	separate nationhood by virtue of a change of religion.    
 As regards the August 1942 disturbances, Mahatma Gandhi is said to have declared that the Government themselves have absolved him of charge of “treachery” and of trying to assist the Japanese.
 Mahatma Gandhi had informed Maj. Longden that though he had no objection to the publication of the questions and answers he thought it would be inadvisable to publish them at this stage and Maj. Longden agreed.

742,"May 27, 1945",FOREWORD TO “GITAGITMANJARI”,"
    
 I have discovered no easy way of enjoying the music of songs. I cannot, therefore, easily drink in the joy that they are capable of giving. It has happened sometimes that when a song was sung in a manner I found sweet, I fully enjoyed it and also understood its meaning. Sometimes I myself have been able to hum the tune of a song, and then I have both fully enjoyed the music and understood the meaning.
 Jugatramlibtech_704_footnotehas requested such a person—with much hesitation— to say a few words by way of blessings. “With much hesitation” because he knows the value of my time, as also my limitations.
 If, in spite of that, he has requested my blessings, the reason is that I look upon the Gita as a lexicon of the soul. I have not been able to read the Manjari from beginning to end. But I have carefully glanced through it. I liked the work. The author’s labour is evident. Jugatram has, in his own manner, put into song what he has liked in the different chapters of the Gita. The glossary following the Preface in the Manjari , the selected passages from Gitabodhlibtech_705_footnoteand Anasaktiyog, which are relevant to the context, and the relevant verses from the Gita are likely to prove useful to a serious student of the work. Jugatram has not come to the end of his journey. He has come as far as Chapter
 12. Let us hope that he will be able to complete the journey. He has done well also to include, after the 60th manjari, the songs written for Kakasaheb’s Be Kerilibtech_706_footnote.
 
 
 The student should also know that Jugatram practises the teaching of the Gita as he has understood it, and is one of the few who draw from the fountain of milk unceasingly flowing from it. Hence anybody who wishes to enjoy the fragrance of this Manjari should touch it only if he wishes to practise the teaching of the Gita and work in the spirit of non-attachment, or derive strength for such work.

  	You have given me a good job indeed. Here is the Forewordlibtech_707_footnotelibtech_708_footnote, or whatever you care to call it. It took more than 	four hours of my time to write it. For me that is too much. But I 	had no choice. I like such jobs, but I am no longer fit for them. 	The work which I have planned to do here takes most of my time, or 	rather all the time that I get. My purpose in writing this is not to 	reproach you for giving me a job like this but, through you, to stop 	others from doing the same. How can I reproach you? And then you 	have written Manjari only to help me in my work. Isn’t that 	so? This is no mere rhetoric. You have called the ninth manjari 	“Samata Yoga” and the 40th “Samata”. You will observe 	that the word ‘samata’ bears two different meanings in the two 	places. I would call the ninth “Samata”, dropping “Yoga”, 	and the 40th “Samatva” or “Samabhava”. The reason is plain. 	The discussion of Chapter 12 ends at the 60th manjari. I see 	from the contents that you have included something from Be Keri. 	There should be some mention of it, on p. 152libtech_709_footnotelibtech_710_footnote. Think over it. If something can be done about it, do 	so.

 “MORARJI CASTLE”, MAHABALESHWAR,
 May 27, 1945
 THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY HOME DEPARTMENT
BOMBAY
 DEAR SIR,
 I refer you to my letterlibtech_711_footnoteof 6th May, 1944, written  from  the Detention Camp.
 Up till recently there has been no hitch about friends and relatives going to the samadhis of the two departed ones, my wife and Shri Mahadev Desai. But a hitch occurred recently. Tactful handling made devotion fairly possible during fixed hours. Now comes the rumour that H. H. the Aga Khan’s Palace is about to be occupied by the Military and in that event, devotion may not be permitted at all. I can only hope that the fear is wholly unjustified.
 In my letter of 6th May, 1944, to the Government I reduced my contention to writing to the effect that
 by reason of the cremation of the corpses of Shri Mahadev Desai and then my wife, the place of cremation which has been fenced off becomes consecrated ground. The party has daily visited the ground twice and offered floral tributes to the departed spirits and said prayers. I trust that the plot will be acquired by the Government with the right of way to it through H. H. the Aga Khan’s grounds so as to enable those relatives and friends who wish to visit the cremation ground whenever they like.
To this the following reply was received:
 I am to inform you that it is legally impossible for Government to acquire the site compulsorily under the Land Acquisition Act. Government considers that the matter is one for private negotiations between you and His Highness the Aga Khan. I am to add, however, that your request has been communicated to His Highness the Aga Khan and is now understood to be
 under his consideration. Government understands that he has no objection, in the mean while, to the relatives of Mrs. Gandhi and Mr. Mahadev Desai and any other persons suggested by you going through the Palace
 
 grounds to the place of cremation on the understanding that this is by his leave and licence.
I do hope that, no matter who occupies or owns the palace, the
 consecrated ground on which the two samadhis stand will be protected and reserved for devotion by the friends and relatives of the families.
 I am, etc.,

It was your duty to go to Father. It was good 	you went there. Come here after you are able to leave the place. If 	you get permission to see Jayaprakash only during that time—it is 
 your duty to go there. Your next duty is to come to me. You will stay here only as long as it is necessary. So come soon. I will reach Panchgani on the 31st. Mahabaleshwar is only a little higher up. Why do you feel shy of spectacles? Khurshedbehn is at Panchgani. More when we meet. Is Father all right? Convey my blessings to him.

 MY DEAR BHARATAN,
 Your letter and the book.libtech_713_footnoteAppasamy came, left the book and went away. I have not met him. I wonder if he will seek me out and meet me though I am silent the whole day till evening prayer!
 You need not apologize for sending me the book. I must read it.  I glanced at it, as it came into my hands. How does it differ from your description of socialism which you say centres round society and its needs and villagism which you say centres round the village and its wants? Do you mark any difference? Is not village and its welfare the same as society and its needs? Is not the difference this: socialism includes violence as a measure to achieve it, villagism excludes it?
 My English is not perfect. It may be relatively better than Hindustani. I must try to make it equal to my English, if it is not. I reach the masses only through Hindustani however imperfect it may be, never through English, however perfect it may be. If you admit this, the Patrika would be only in Hindustani and the provinces will render it in the provincial languages, the people thereof  will understand. You may have an English translation of necessary extracts for the foreign reader. This can happen only when both of you see the point and resolve to write in Hindustani however imperfect it may be. I migrate to Panchgani on 31st May.
 Love.

 Your 	letter came on yesterday.  	Both Pyarelal and Narahari had been to the place. They do not think 	much of it. The work done is make believe. It is a poor house giving 	charity.

 The letter from Ramdas (May 14, 1945) is nice. He can only argue thus. He will never give up khadi. But he cannot easily forget his experience. Shriman has taken his argument to the extreme. It is impossible today. Ramdas does not know the whole of India directly or indirectly. It is not his fault. One must be acquainted with the situation in India in order to make a scientific study. The situation about which he is talking is due to the invasion from the West. There can only be violence at the root of Ramdas’s  statement.  If non-violence has to prevail, many things will have to be carried on without steam power, etc.
 That there should be big factories run by the people for big industries is a matter of regret, not of joy. In brief, Ramdas will have to think very deeply. I know that ultimately Ramdas will be able to give up his attachment.

 APPENDICES
 APPENDIX I
 PYARELAL’S STATEMENTlibtech_727_footnote
 Gandhiji, having seen it, says that he never sent any such or other circular to Congress workers or committees in any or all the Provinces. The statement that has appeared in the Press to that effect is, therefore, wrong. He holds the view, and has shared it with correspondents, that as long as the Congress President and his colleagues are in prison, Congressmen must act on their own initiative and judgment and no individual or group or assembly, whatever name they give to themselves, will have the authority to act in the name or on behalf of the Congress organization. They are entitled to and bound to act as they deem it best in the interests of the cause for which the Congress stands, but they do so on their own authority and responsibility and cannot use the name of the Congress to enforce their decision. Gandhiji adds that such is his individual opinion.
