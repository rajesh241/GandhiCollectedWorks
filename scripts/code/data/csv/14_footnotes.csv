libtech_53_footnote,"1Gandhiji, 	accompanied by C. F. 	Andrews, arrived in 	Pretoria on 	the morning  of January 	9, for 	negotiations with 	Smuts. A brief 	summary of 	those observations 	appeared in 	Indian Opinion, 	14-1-1914. The 	Governor-General, Lord Gladstone, 	forwarded to 	the Colonial Office, a 	clipping of 	the interview “in 	which”, he 	observed, “Mr. 	Gandhi gave a personal 	assurance that he 	and his friends 	would refrain 	from resuming 	operations until the 	railway strike was 	settled.” In 	Charles Freer Andrews, 	pp. 95-6, 	there appears a report 	of this 	interview which puts 	it in its 	proper context: 	“At Pretoria, the 	Editor of the Pretoria 	News greeted Gandhi 	in friendly 	fashion. ‘Are the 	Indians going 	to join 	the General Strike?’ he 	asked. ‘No, 	certainly not,’ 	replied Gandhi. 	‘We are out for a 	clean fight. Passive 	resistance will be 	suspended.’ ‘May 	I publish 	that?’ ‘No—there 	is no need 	to do so.’ 	The Editor 	turned to Andrews. 	‘Do persuade him, Mr. 	Andrews,’ he said. ‘There will be Martial Law within twelve 	hours.’ Andrews took 	his meaning; 	up and 	down they walked, 	outside the Editor’s 	office, while he 	argued the 	point with 	Gandhi. ‘Of 	course, you 	are right to 	suspend the 	struggle,’ he 	said, ‘but if 	no one knows 	till afterwards, all 	the good effect will be 	lost—people will say you did it out of fear?’ At last Gandhi 	yielded: the message went out, 	with all its power 	for good, 	to Cape 	Town and the world. 	A few minutes 	later the strikers 	cut the telegraph 	wires.” In Satyagraha 	in South 	Africa, Ch. 	XLVII, Gandhiji 	has this to 	say on 	his refusal 	to embarrass 	the Government: 	“This decision 	of ours 	created a deep 	impression, and was cabled to England by Reuter. Lord Ampthill 	cabled his 	congratulations from 	England. English friends in 	South Africa too 	appreciated our 	decision. One 	of the 	secretaries of 	General Smuts jocularly 	said: ‘I do not 	like your people, 	and do 	not care 	to assist 	them at all. 	But what 	am I to do? 	You help us 	in our days 	of need. 	How can we lay hands 	upon you? I often 	wish you took 	to violence 	like the 	English strikers, and 	then we 	would know at 	once how 	to dispose of 	you. But 	you will not injure 	even the enemy. 	You desire 	victory by self-suffering 	alone and never 	transgress your 	self-imposed limit of 	courtesy and 	chivalry. And 	that is 	what reduces 	us to sheer 	helplessness.’ General 	Smuts also gave expression to  similar 	sentiments.”"

libtech_60_footnote,"2For the rest of the despatch covering the subsequent course of negotiations, vide”Extract from Governor-General’s Despatch”, 22-1-1914. During the last days of the negotiations, news reached Gandhiji that Kasturba was seriously ill in Durban. At   a moment, on January 21, when the talks had reached a deadlock over a phrase which General Smuts had wanted to insert in the proposed agreement, an urgent telegram summoned Gandhiji to Durban; but Gandhiji refused to leave till the deadlock had been removed. Andrews recorded what happened during that critical night in these words: “That night we talked till 1 a.m. Finally, an alternative phrase occurred to me. The difference seemed to be very slight, but Gandhi found it acceptable. ‘If General Smuts will accept your phrase,’ he said as we went to bed, ‘then everything is finished.’ In the morning, saying nothing to Gandhi, I went to Smuts and at eight o’clock found him alone. I told him Gandhi’s personal anxiety, and showed him the suggested wording. ‘I don’t mind a bit,’ he said, ‘it makes no difference as far as I am concerned.’ ‘Would you make the change and sign on the spot?’ ‘Certainly.”’ Charles Freer Andrews, pp. 96-7. The settlement reached, Gandhiji and Andrews left for Durban, by the 11 o’clock train, on January 22. According to the Governor-General’s observations at the end of his despatch of January 22, 1914, the sentence inserted at Gandhiji’s suggestion was: “He also recognizes the motive which makes you  unwilling to revive old sores by courting libel proceedings before another tribunal.” Vide Appendix “Letter from Minister of Interior”, 21-1-1914, paragraph 1. Vide also the following item."

libtech_62_footnote,"1In Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XLVIII, Gandhiji has reported Smuts’ observations as follows: “The Indians had demanded that a member should  be  co-opted to the Commission to represent Indian interests. But on this point General Smuts would not give in. ‘That cannot be done,’ said he, ‘as it would be derogatory to the Government’s prestige and I would be unable to carry out the desired reforms. You must understand that Mr. Esselen is our man, and would fall in with, not oppose, the Government’s wishes as regards reform. Colonel Wylie is a man of position in Natal and might even be considered anti-Indian. If therefore even he agrees to a repeal   of the £3 tax, the Government will have an easy task before them. Our troubles are manifold; we have not a moment to spare and therefore wish to set the Indian question at rest. We have decided to grant your demands, but for this we must have a recommendation from the Commission. I understand your position too. You have solemnly declared that you will not lead evidence before it so long as there is no representative of the Indians sitting on the Commission. I do not mind if you do not tender evidence, but you should not organize any active propaganda to prevent anyone who wishes to give evidence from doing so, and should suspend Satyagraha in the interval. I believe that by so doing you will be serving your own interests as well as giving me a respite. As you will not tender evidence, you will not be able to prove your allegations as regards ill treatment accorded to the Indian strikers. But that is for you to think Over.”"

Where should he go to find such faithful, such noble friends, if he might say so, as Senator Marshall Campbell. Senator Marshall Campbell had shared their miseries and shared their sorrows; even in the thick of the struggle he had come in order to learn, and in order to gain, and he had no doubt that anybody who did join such a struggle did learn and did gain. It had never been a struggle of violence. They had not used passive resistance as a weapon of the weak. to be properly wielded, it required an infinitely stronger weapon than violence. If the spirit which had guided the deliberations of both Houses in the passage of that Bill, and of all their individual friends, was the spirit which would be applied to several other problems, there need be no fear of a recrudescence of passive resistance. After a struggle lasting eight years, the Indians needed a period of peace, and it was for the Europeans not to be sparing of sympathies.”"

libtech_336_footnote,"1In the course of his report, the representative of The Transvaal Leader summed up thus his own estimate of Gandhiji: “So it is humanly certain that the most arresting figure in the Indian community in South Africa today is to say good-bye to a country in which he has spent many years, crowded with experience and exertion, his work on behalf of his countrymen at last crowned with success. When a man has been imprisoned so often that were his offences not merely political he would have qualified as an ‘habitual’, when he has times without number endured fatigue, and fasted with a smile, when he has moved steadily on over obstacles that might daunt the bravest, to the goal on which his eye has been fixed, you might picture him physically as an Apollo, and imagine his heart made of the fibre that belongs to martyrs. In the qualities of the heart and of the soul you may believe the best of Gandhi, but you would wonder, did you see him, that so frail a figure could house so vigorous a character.”"

Essop 	Ismail Mia presided. 	Gandhiji’s speech 	largely comprised 	statements made 	in reply 	to various 	questions put 	to him 	by the 	Chairman of 	the meeting and 	by other speakers. 	Rand Daily Mail, 	16-7-1914, reported 	Mia’s observations 	as follows: 	“The Chairman whose 	remarks were interpreted— 	 sometimes with 	the aid of Mr. 	Gandhi himself—-asked 	on whose authority 	the compromise 	was made with the 	Government. He 	next referred 	to the funds 	of the 	plague hospital, and 	wished Mr. 	Gandhi to 	say what had become 	of the 	funds. Ever 	since the commencement 	the Indian 	Association had 	subscribed, and 	he wished 	the accounts 	to come 	before the public, 	and that 	Mr. Gandhi 	should explain the 	position. Four 	points had been 	put forward, 	and Mr. Gandhi, 	according to his 	view, had 	gained only one and a 	half. In the marriage problem a question had cropped up which 	required explanation, 	affecting the 	Mahommedans. He 	would explain to 	his merchand 	friends what 	they had gained during their eight years’ struggle. Mr. Gandhi had 	said in Durban that 	no man 	could satisfy everybody. 	He wished 	to say 	that Mr. 	Gandhi had 	left them 	with the 	battle to 	be fought all 	over again. As 	regards the 	marriage question, not 	only the Mahommedans, but the Hindus also had said that they had gained nothing.”"

libtech_344_footnote,"1The Transvaal Leader report here furnishes details of Gandhiji’s reply on this point: “He had not yet heard a Hindoo say he was not satisfied with the marriage question. That was where they had gained a little more than they asked. Before the Port Elizabeth case, they thought one Indian wife would be recognized, no matter what her religion. That was overturned; and they came to the conclusion that they should ask the Government to legalise one-wife marriage throughout South Africa. Polygamy had been a question in this country for 50 years, but the only question which arose concerning the Settlement was that of monogamous marriages. What they asked in this respect was granded, and a little more also, for Magistrates were allowed to legalise marriages. Polygamy they could practise, but it was not legalised. Natives could only have one wife. Sir William Solomon wanded to go as far as that with the Indians, but he (Mr. Gandhi) said, ‘No; if you do, we will fight.’ All he expected the South African Government to do was to become tolerand of polygamy, but not to legalise it.”"

libtech_350_footnote,"2Here H. O. Ally, who had in 1909 accompanied Gandhiji on a deputation to England, raised a number of points, as reported by Rand Daily Mail: “It was only fair that Mr. Gandhi should call a mass meeting and explain the Settlement. They had heard one thing from his speeches in Cape Town and another thing from his speeches in Durban. In his speech at the Masonic Hall again, Mr. Gandhi had admitted that the Colonial-born question was not settled. Many things were not settled, and yet with what right or face could any Indian organisations apply to General Smuts in the future, and say there were certain disabilities and grievances that were killing their people—in the face of Mr. Gandhi’s expressions here of the ‘final honourable settlement’?"
libtech_351_footnote,"2At this stage, there were further questions put to Gandhiji. According to The Transvaal Leader report: “Mr. Stent asked how Mr. Gandhi could say he represented Indian opinion, when the Hamidia Islamic Society and the Hamdad Society passed a resolution on March 31 saying that he and his friends had no authority to act for them? He had been deliberately repudiated by the two societies. Mr. Gandhi received certain funds for the passive resistance movement, and it was up to him to give an account of them. Habib Motan asked if Mr. Gandhi did not take £1,200 for the Phoenix newspaper.”"

We thank 	him not only 	for what 	he did, 	but also 	in that 	what he did 	will strengthen the 	Indian nation in 	the future. 	Mr. Gandhi’s 	great help to 	us is that of 	inspiration—an 	inspiration to 	self-sacrifice, an 	inspiration to 	following of 	a great 	ideal, the 	recognition of 	the fact that there is 	no dishonour in 	anything that is 	endured for 	the sake of right 	and justice, 	and that a 	prison is 	no dishonour when 	the soul within it is free, and when prison is accepted as the price of that liberty.”"
