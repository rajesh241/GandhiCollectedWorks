       SATYAGRAHA 	ASHRAM, SABARMATI,  September 	10, 1928   MY 	DEAR KRISHNADAS,  	Your letter about Ram Binod gives me much relief. I  am  sending 	copies to Jamnalalji and others. You do not say anything about 	re-ported purchases by Ram Binod. Is there any truth in those 	allega-tions?  	I received the Bengali edition of Seven Monthslibtech_2_footnote. Is it selling well? The English edition badly lacks 	an index. There are mis- prints 	too.  	How are you keeping in health and how is Guruji?  	The Ashram is undergoing many drastic changes of which per- haps 	Giriraj writes to you. With 	love,

2,"September 	10, 1928",LETTER TO BALKRISHNA BHAVE,"
       ASHRAM, SABARMATI,  September 	10, 1928   CHI. 	BALKRISHNA,  	I have your letter. But I have never held that one who  is actually 	a soldier—and not one in outward appearance should‘also be a    	jnanilibtech_3_footnotelibtech_4_footnote. But I would certainly say that anyone who was not a 	soldier, or could not become one, could never be a jnani. The same 	is true about being a brahmachari. We do not see in life that 	anyone who has mastered one of his senses is necessarily a man of 	knowledge, but all of us hold that immorality is impossible in a 	jnani. I do not      
 think I need to be a jnani to be able to put my hands on the shoulders of girls when walking without being disturbed by the touch. A father with many daughters who has pure feelings towards them may still be sunk in ignorance in other respects. He may even have impure  feelings towards other women. It is but natural that I should have fatherly feelings for the girls in the Ashram. I have cultivated this state of heart over the years. Though I have, thus, pure feelings towards them as towards most women, I am not in a position to claim further that I have always experienced such pure feelings towards every woman. My present condition is cer-tainly pure, but, so long as I have not become completely free from every kind of impure feeling, I cannot say that I feel no fear about the future too. I have never believed or felt myself to be a jnani. On the contrary, I realize my state of ignorance every day. I have never felt that I am committing the slightest wrong in putting my hands on the shoulders of girls, for I know that they are but daughters to me. That being so, it is also not true that I have done them harm by my conduct. I have felt that through such intimacy I have entered their heart and that in consequence they have become purer in their feelings towards men. I have also considered the matter from the point of view of the effect of my conduct on society. There is certainly a belief among Hindus that even a father should shrink from touching his daughter. This seems to me a wrong notion, an enemy of brahmacharya. That brahmacharya which  enter-tains  such  fear  is  no  brahmacharya.   Rishyashringa’slibtech_5_footnotebrahmacharya is not our ideal. Nevertheless, for the past three weeks I have practically given up putting my hands on the shoulders of girls regarded as grown-up, for the doubt which occurred to you occurred also to other inmates of the Ashram. In such a matter I need not insist on my own point of view. Putting one’s hands on the shoulders of girls cannot be a matter of principle, and therefore as soon as the issue was raised I discussed the matter with everyone and gave up the practice. ‘The girls have felt a little hurt by this, but on the whole they are reconciled to it and in time will get completely reconciled. No one, of course, should imitate my practice. Anyone who has fatherly feelings towards girls will not shrink, when necessary, from touching them in a manner befitting a father and the world also will not censure him.
 
 I do not understand what you write about . . .libtech_6_footnoteand why you are pained by the matter. You admit that you made a mistake in writing to him and advising him to follow my advice and in asking me to guide him. After that, where was the need for me to discuss the matter with you? Moreover, how could I believe that you could tell me anything more than what . . . would about his relation to his wife? Despite what you write and tell me, I believe that my advice to . . . was the right one. I have sent him there with the advice, and in the hope that, if he was sincere in the vow of brahmacharya which he had taken in regard to his wife, he would even now observe it. He has gone there to demonstrate that he is a brother and a friend of his wife. This is my view of the matter, which he has completely under stood. If, instead of behaving as a brother, he acts like a husband, you may assume that his vow of brahmacharya in regard to his wife was insincere. It was only waiting for an opportunity to be broken. I suppose you have not overlooked the fact that he was never free from impure  feelings towards other women. If. . . still writes to you about himself, I suggest that you should come and see me in the matter. I had suggested this course to you even earlier. I think it best that you should give up the attempt to guide . . . independently. If you do not understand what I have said in this letter, ask me again. You should have no doubt at all,  I have none, about the rightness of my advice to . . . If you have any, however, or feel any doubt later, ask me again and again.
 I very much liked your caution regarding the common kitchen. Our ideal of the Ashram is that even visitors should observe brahmacharya while they stay in it. This rule is made categorical in the new set of rules. That has naturally added to the number of those taking their meals in the common kitchen. How can we say that even those who take the vow of brahmacharya are not brahmacharis of their own will? I, however, believe your statement that many have joined the common kitchen out of their respect for me. The kitchen has led to a new idea during the past few days. There is no suggestion that it should be abandoned, but a proposal is being discussed whether those who cannot sincerely be its members and  cannot whole-heartedly adopt its other implications should not leave the Ashram.
 I shall await your letter regarding the effect of the use of linseed oil. How do you obtain fresh linseed oil? Do you obtain a day’s or a
 
 month’s requirement, at a time? Do you get oil pressed by an indigenous or an English mill? If it is oil pressed in an indigenous mill and if you know the process through which the seed is passed before it is pressed, please let me know. If you do not know this, get the information and let me have it.

3,"September 10, 1928",SPEECH ON BIRTH CENTENARY OF TOLSTOYlibtech_7_footnote,"
  
 September 10, 1928
 My present state of mind does not at all permit me to join in celebrating any day or festival. Some time ago a reader of Navajivan or Young India asked me a question: “You have statedlibtech_8_footnotelibtech_9_footnote, writing about shraddha, that the right way of performing the shraddha of  our elders, on their death-anniversary day, is to recall their virtues and make them our own. May I ask you, therefore, how you observe the shraddha days of your elders?” I  used to observe these days when  I was  young,  but  I  don’t  mind  telling  you  that  now  I  do  not  even remember the dates  on  which  they  fall.  I  do  not  recall  to have observed any such day during the past many years. Such is my unhappy state of mind, or rather, you may say, my charming or, as some friends believe, profound, ignorance. I believe it is enough if we fix our attention every minute of the day on the task in hand, think about it and do it as methodically as we can. We thereby celebrate the death anniversary of our elders as also the memory of men like Tolstoy. If Dr. Hariprasad had not drawn me into the net, it is quite likely that I would have arranged no celebration in the Ashram on this day, the 10th: it is even likely that I would have forgotten the day altogether. I had letters three months ago from Aylmer Maude and others engaged in collecting Tolstoy’s writings, requesting me to send an article on the occasion of this centenary celebration and to draw the country’s attention to this date. You must have seen an abstract of Aylmer Maude’s letter, or perhaps the whole of it, published  in  Young
 
 India.libtech_10_footnoteAfterwards I forgot all about this matter. This is an auspicious occasion for me, but I would not have felt sorry if I had discovered that I had forgotten it. All the same, I welcome the opportunity which members of the Youth Association have offered of celebrating this day in the Ashram.
 I wish I could say that, like Dattatreya, I had accepted many persons in this world as my gurus, but I am not in that position. I have said, on the contrary, that I am still in search of a guru in religious matters. It is my belief, which grows stronger day by day, that one must have especial fitness to find a guru. A guru comes unsought to him who has it. I lack such fitness. I have described Gokhale as my political guru. He had satisfied all my expectations of a guru in that field. I never doubted or questioned the propriety of his views or instructions. I cannot say that of anyone as a guru in religious matters.
 And yet, I would say that three men have had a very great influence on my life. Among them I give the first place to the poet Rajchandra, the second to Tolstoy and the third to Ruskin. If I had to choose between Tolstoy and Ruskin and if I knew more about the lives of both, I would not know to whom to give preference. At  present, however, I give the place to Tolstoy. I have not read as much of Tolstoy’s life as many others may have, and in fact I have not read very much of his writings either. Among his works the one which has had the greatest effect on me is The Kingdom of God Is within You. The title means that God’s Kingdom is in our heart, that if we search for it out-side we shall find it nowhere. I read the book forty years ago. At that time, I was sceptical about many things and sometimes entertained atheistic ideas. When I went to England, I was a votary of violence, I had faith in it and none in non-violence. After I read this book, that lack of faith in non-violence vanished. Later I read some of his other books, but I cannot describe what effect they had on me. I can only say what effect his life as a whole had on me.
 I attach importance to two things in his life. He did what he preached. His simplicity was extraordinary; it was not merely outward; outward simplicity of course he had. Though he was born in an aristocratic family and had all the good things of life to enjoy, had at his disposal all that wealth and possessions could give a man, he changed the direction of his life’s voyage in the prime of youth. Though he had enjoyed all the pleasures and tasted all the sweetness
 
 which life can offer, the moment he realized the futility of that way of life he turned his back on it, and he remained firm in his new convictions till the end of his life. I have, therefore, stated in some message I have sent that Tolstoy was the very embodiment of truth in this age. He strove uncompromisingly to follow truth as he saw it, making no attempt to conceal or dilute what he believed to be the truth. He stated what he felt to be the truth without caring whether it would hurt or please the people or whether it would be welcome to the mighty emperor. Tolstoy was a great advocate of non-violence in his age. I know of no author in the West who has written as much and as effectively for the cause of non-violence as Tolstoy has done. I may go even further and say that I know no one in India or elsewhere who has had as profound an understanding of the nature of non-violence as Tolstoy had and who has tried to follow it as sincerely as he did.
 I feel unhappy about this state of affairs, I do not like it. India is karmabhumilibtech_11_footnotelibtech_12_footnote. The sages and   seers  of  this  country  have  made  the biggest discoveries in the sphere of non-violence. But we cannot live on inherited wealth. If we do not continue to add to it, we would be eating it away. The late Justice Ranade has cautioned us against this. We may complacently quote the Vedas and Jain literature and talk profound things, or propound great principles and strike the world dumb, but people will not believe in our sincerity. Hence Ranade pointed it out as our duty that we should add to our inheritance. We should compare it with the writings of  other religious thinkers and  if, as a result of such comparison, we discover anything new or find new light shed on a subject, we should not reject it. We have, however, failed to do this. Oar religious heads are always one-sided in their thinking. There is no harmony between their words and deeds. We do not have among us men who, like Tolstoy, would speak out the plain truth irrespective of whether or not that would please the people or the society in which they work Such is the pitiable condition of this our land of non-violence. Our non-violence is an unworthy thing. We see its utmost limit in refraining somehow from destroying bugs, mosquitoes and fleas, or from killing birds and animals. We do not care if these creatures suffer, nor even if we partly contribute to their suffering. On the contrary, we think it a heinous sin if anyone releases or helps in releasing a creature that suffers. I have already written and explained that this is not non-violence, and I take this occasion, when I
 
 am speaking about Tolstoy, to repeat that that is not the meaning of non-violence. Non-violence means an ocean of compassion, it means shedding from us every trace of ill-will for others. It does not mean abjectness or timidity, or fleeing in fear. It means, on the contrary, firmness of mind and courage, a resolute spirit.
 We do not see this non-violence in the educated classes in India. For them Tolstoy’s life should be a source of inspiration. He strove hard to put into practice what he believed in, and never turned back from his chosen path. I do not believe that he did not find that sticklibtech_13_footnotelibtech_14_footnote. He himself said, of course, that he had failed to discover it, but that was his humility. I do not agree with his critics that he did not find that stick. I might perhaps agree if anyone asserted that he did not fully act upon the principle of non-violence of which he had had a glimpse. But, then, has there been anyone in this world who could act upon the principle of non-violence fully while he lived? I believe it impossible for one living in this body to observe non-violence to perfection. While the body endures, some degree of egotism is inescapable. We retain the body only so long as egotism persists. Bodily life, therefore, necessarily involves violence. Tolstoy himself said that anyone who believed that he had realized his ideal would be lost. From the moment he believed that, his fall would begin. The further we travel towards an ideal the further it recedes. As we advance in its search, we realize that we have one step after another to climb. No one can climb all the steps in one leap. This view does not imply cravenness of spirit or pessimism but certainly there is humility in it. Hence our sages and seers said that the state of moksha meant utter emptiness. He who aspires after moksha must develop a state of such emptiness. One cannot attain this without God’s grace. That state of emptiness can only remain an ideal as long as one lives in this body. The moment Tolstoy saw this truth clearly, grasped it with his intellect and started on his journey towards the ideal, he had found the green stick. He could not describe it, but could have only said that he had found it. If, however, he had in fact said that he had found it, progress in life would have been over for him.
 The seeming contradictions in Tolstoy’s life are no blot on him or sign of his failure. They signify the failure of the observer. Emer- son has said that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.
 
 We would be utterly lost if we tried to live and show that there was no contradiction in our lives. In trying to live in that manner, we would have to remember what we did yesterday and then harmonize our actions today with that; in trying to preserve such forced harmony, we would have to resort to untruth. The best way is to follow the truth as one sees it at the moment. If we are progressing from day to day, why should we worry if others see contradictions in us? In truth, what looks like contradiction is not contradiction, but progress. And so, what seems to be contradiction in Tolstoy’s life is really not contradiction, but only an illusion in our minds. Only the man himself knows how much he struggles in the depth of his heart or what victories he wins in the war between Rama and Ravana. The spectator certainly cannot know that. If the person slips ever so little, the world will think that there was nothing in him; this, of course, is for the best. One should not condemn the world on that account and so the saints have said that we should rejoice when the world speaks ill of us, but tremble with fear when it praises us. The world cannot act otherwise than it does; it must censure where it sees evil. But, whenever we examine the life of a great man, we should bear in mind what I have explained. God is witness to the battles he may have fought in his heart and the victories he may have won. These are the only evidence of his failures and successes.
 By saying this, I do not wish to suggest that you should cover up your weaknesses, or, when they are as big as hills, think that they are as small as grains of sand. What I have said is in regard to other people. We should look upon others’ weaknesses, huge as the Hima- layas, to be as small as mustard seeds and  ours,  as small as mustard seeds, to be as big as the Himalayas. When we become aware of the slightest lapse on our part or seem to have become guilty of un- truth, intentionally or otherwise, we should feel as if we were burning, as if we were caught in flames. A snake bite or a scorpion sting is of little consequence; you will find many who can cure them. Is there anyone, however, who can cure us of the sting of untruth or violence? God alone can do that, and He will do it only if we strive in earnest. Hence, we should be vigilant against our weaknesses and magnify them to the utmost, so that, when the world censures us, we should not think that people were mean-minded and exaggerated our faults. If anyone pointed out a weakness in Tolstoy, though there could hardly
 be an occasion for anyone to do so for he was pitiless in his self-exa- mination, he would magnify that weakness to fearful proportions. He would have seen his lapse and atoned for it in the manner he thought most appropriate before anyone had pointed it out to him. This is a sign of goodness, and I think, therefore, that he had found that stick.
 Tolstoy drew people’s attention to another thing through his writings and his life, and that is the idea of “bread labour”. It was not his own discovery. Another author had mentioned it in a Russian Miscellany; Tolstoy made his name known to the world and also put before it his idea. The cause of the inequalities we see in the world, of the contrasts of wealth and poverty, lies in the fact that we have forgotten the law of life. That law is the law of “bread labour”. On the authority of Chapter III of the Gita, I call it yajna. The Gita says that he who eats without performing yajna is a thief and  sinner. Tolstoy has said the same thing. We should not distort the meaning of “bread labour” and forget the real idea. Its simple meaning is that he has no right to eat who does not bend his body and work. If every one of us did bodily labour to earn his food, we would not see the poverty which we find in the world. One idler is the cause of two persons starving, for his work has to be done by someone else. Tolstoy said that people came forward for philanthropic service, spent money for the purpose and earned titles as reward for their service, but he said it would be enough if, instead of all this, they did a little physical work and got off the backs of others. That is true indeed. In that lies humility. To do philan-thropic service but refuse to give up one’s luxuries is to act in the way described by Akha Bhagat, “Stealing an anvil and gifting a needle”. Can we hope thereby to go up in a vimanlibtech_15_footnoteto heaven?
It is not that others have not said what Tolstoy said, but there was
 magic in Tolstoy’s language, for he acted upon what he preached. He who was accustomed to the comforts of wealth started doing physical labour. He used to work on the farm or do other labour for eight hours a day. That does not mean that he gave up literary work. In fact, after he started doing physical labour his literary work came to have greater life in it. It was during spare time in this period of yajna that he wrote what he described as his most important work, What Is Art? Physical labour did not tell upon his health, and he believed that it sharpened his intellect. Students of his works will bear testimony that he was right.
If we wish to benefit from Tolstoy’s life, we should learn these
 
 three things from it. I am addressing members of a youth association, and I wish to remind them that they have to choose between two paths in life: one of self-indulgence and the other of self-restraint. If you think that Tolstoy lived and died well, you will see that there is only one right path in life for all, especially for the young—and that is the path of self-control. That is particularly true in India. Swaraj is not something to be won from the Government. If  you  examine the causes of our degradation, you will see that we are more responsible for it than the Government. You will then see that the key to swaraj is in our hands, and not in England nor in Simla nor in Delhi. It is in your pocket and mine. Our lethargy is responsible for the delay in remedying the degradation and listlessness of our society. If we overcome that, there is no power on earth which can prevent us from raising ourselves and securing swaraj. We ourselves choose to lie helpless on the path and refuse to lift ourselves out of that condition. I should like to tell the members of the Youth Association that this is a golden time for them, or from another point of view, a hard time, a time of trial, if I put it in a third way. It is not enough that they pass university examinations and secure degrees. They will have secured real degrees only when they pass the examination of life and stand the test of hardships and difficulties. This is a period of transition,  a golden time for you. You have two paths before you: one leading to the north and another to the south, one to the east and another to the west. You have to choose between the two. You must consider which path you will choose. All kinds of winds—poisonous winds, in my view—are blowing into the country from the West. There are, of course, some beautiful currents too, like Tolstoy’s life. But these do not blow with every ship that arrives! You may say  ‘with every ship’  or ‘every day’, for every day a ship arrives in the Bombay or Calcutta port. Along with other foreign goods, foreign literature too arrives. Its ideas intoxicate people and draw them to the path of self-indulgence. I have no doubt about that. Do not be vain and believe that your thoughts, or what in your immaturity you have read in books and understood from them, are the only truth, that what is old is barbarous and uncivilized and that truth lies only in things newly discovered. If you suffer from such vanity, I don’t think you will bring credit to your Association. If you have still not fulfilled my hope that you have learnt humility, culture, a sense of propriety and purity from Sarala Devi, do so in future. Do not be puffed up because you have been praised for some good things you have done. Run away from praise,
 and don’t think that you have done much. If you collected money for Bardoli, worked hard and sweated for the cause, if a few of you went to jail for it, I ask you, as a man of experience, ‘Is it much that you have done?’ Others may say that you have, but you should not rest satisfied with what you have done. You have to purify your inner life, and it is from your conscience that you have to obtain a real certi- ficate. Truly speaking our atman too is generally asleep. It was said by Tilak Maharaj that in our languages we have no word corres- ponding to ‘conscience’. We do not believe that everyone has a cons- cience; in the West they do. What conscience can an adulterous or dis- solute man have? Tilak Maharaj, therefore, rejected the idea of cons- cience. Our seers and sages of old said that one must have an inner ear to hear the inner voice, that one must have the inner eye, and must cultivate self-control to acquire these. Hence, in Patanjali’s treatise on yoga the first step prescribed for the student of yoga, for one aspiring after self-realization, is the observance of the disciplines of yama- niyamalibtech_16_footnotelibtech_17_footnote. There is no path but that of self-control for you or me or others. Tolstoy showed this by leading a long life of self- control. I wish and pray to God that we should be able to see this as clearly as daylight, and should leave this meeting with a resolution that we shall learn the lesson of self-control from Tolstoy’s life.
 Let us resolve that we will never give up the pursuit of truth. To follow truth, the only right path in this world is that of non-violence. Non-violence means an ocean of love, whose vastness no one has ever been able to measure. If it fills us we would be so large-hearted that we would have room in it for the whole world. I know this is difficult to achieve, but not impossible. Thus we heard the poet say, in the prayer with which we commenced, that he would bow his head only to him who was free from attachment and aversion, who had overcome all desires and who was the perfect embodiment of non-violence, that is, love, whether he was named Shanker or Vishnu or Brahma or Indra or  whether  he  was  Buddha  or  Siddhalibtech_18_footnotelibtech_19_footnote?  Such  non-violence  is  not limited to refraining from killing disabled creatures. It  may  be  dharma not to kill them, but love goes infinitely further than that. What does it profit a person that he saves the lives of disabled crea- tures, if he has had no vision of such love? In God’s court, his work will have little value.
 
 The third thing is bread labour—yajna. We earn the right to eat only by putting the body to hard work, by doing physical labour. Yajna means any work done for the service of others. It is not enough that we do physical labour; we should live only in order that we may serve others, and not that we may run after immoral and worldly pleasures. If a young man who has trained his body with rigorous exercise spends eight hours every day in such exercise, he is not doing ‘bread labour’. I do not belittle your doing exercise and training your body; but such exercise does not constitute the yajna which Tolstoy has advised and which is described in Chapter III of the Gita. He who believes that this life is for yajna, for service, will day by day give up running after pleasures. True human effort consists in striving to realize this ideal. It does not matter if no human being has  succeeded in doing that to perfection; let the ideal ever remain distant from us. We should walk and break stones, as Farhad did for Shirin, our Shirin being the ideal of non-violence. This certainly holds our little Swaraj, but it holds everything else too.

7,,MY ATTITUDE TOWARDS WAR,"
  
 Rev. B. de Ligt has written in a French journal called Evolution a long open letter to me. He has favoured me with a translation of it. The open letter strongly criticizes my participation in the Boer Warlibtech_23_footnoteand then the Great Warlibtech_24_footnoteof 1914 and invites me to explain my con- duct in the light of ahimsa. Other friends too have put the same ques- tion. I have attempted to give the explanation more than once in these columns.
 There is no defence for my conduct weighed only in the scales of ahimsa. I draw no distinction between those who wield the wea- pons of destruction and those who do red-cross work. Both participate in war and advance its cause. Both are guilty of the crime of war. But even after introspection during all these years, I feel that in the cir- cumstances in which I found myself I was bound to adopt the course I did both during the Boer War and the Great European War and for that matter the so-called Zulu “Rebellion”libtech_25_footnoteof Natal in 1906.
 Life is governed by a multitude of forces. It would be smooth sailing, if one could determine the course of one’s actions only by one general principle whose application at a given moment was too obvious to need even a moment’s reflection. But I cannot recall a single act which could be so easily determined.
 Being a confirmed war resister I have never given myself train- ing in the use of destructive weapons in spite of opportunities to take such training. It was perhaps thus that I escaped direct destruction of human life. But so long as I lived under a system of Government
 
 Training Corps”, 22-9-1914 and “Letter to India”, 4-11-1914; and also “Letter to J.
 L. Maffey”, 30-4-1918 and “Appeal for Enlistment”, 22-6-1918.
 based on force and voluntarily partook of the many facilities and privileges it created for me, I was bound to help that Government to the extent of my ability when it was engaged in a war unless I non-co-operated with that Government and renounced to the utmost of my capacity the privileges it offered me.
 Let me take an illustration. I am a member of an institution which holds a few acres of land whose crops are in imminent peril from monkeys. I believe in the sacredness of all life and hence I regard it as a breach of ahimsa to inflict any injury on the monkeys. But I do not hesitate to instigate and direct an attack on the monkeys in order to save the crops.libtech_26_footnotelibtech_27_footnoteI would like to avoid this evil. I can avoid it by leaving or breaking up the institution. I do not do so because I do not expect to be able to find a society where there will be  no agriculture and therefore no destruction of some life. In fear and trembling, in humility and penance, I therefore participate  in  the injury inflicted on the monkeys, hoping some day to find a way out.
 Even so did I participate in the three acts of war. I could not, it would be madness for me to, sever my connection with the society to which I belong. And on those three occasions I had no thought of non- co-operating with the British Government. My position regarding that Government is totally different today and hence I should not volun- tarily participate in its  wars and I should risk imprisonment and even the gallows if I was forced to take up arms or otherwise take part in its military operations.
 But that still does not solve the riddle. If there was a national Government, whilst I should not take any direct part in any war, I can conceive occasions when it would be my duty to vote for the military training of those who wish to take it. For I know that all its members do not believe in non-violence to the extent I do. It is not possible to make a person or a society non-violent by compulsion.
 Non-violence works in a most mysterious manner.  Often  a man’s actions defy analysis in terms of non-violence; equally often his actions may wear the appearance of violence when he is absolutely non-violent in the highest sense of the term and is subsequently found so to be. All I can then claim for my conduct is that it was, in the instances cited, actuated in the interests of non-violence. There was no thought of national or other interest. I do not believe in the promotion of national or any other interest at the sacrifice of some other interest.
 
 I may not carry my argument any further. Language at best is but a poor vehicle for expressing one’s thoughts in full. For me, non-violence is not a mere philosophical principle. It is the rule and the breath of my life. l know I fail often, sometimes consciously, more often unconsciously. It is a matter not of the intellect but of the heart. True guidance comes by constant waiting upon God, by utmost humility, self-abnegation, by being ever ready to sacrifice one’s self. Its practice requires fearlessness and courage of the highest order. I am painfully aware of my failings.
 But the Light within me is steady and clear. There is no escape for any of us save through truth and non-violence. I know that war is wrong, is an unmitigated evil. I know too that it has got to go. I firmly believe that freedom won through bloodshed or fraud is no freedom. Would that all the acts alleged against me were found to be wholly indefensible rather than that by any act of mine non-violence was held to be compromised or that I was ever thought to be in favour of violence or untruth in any shape or form. Not violence, not untruth, but non-violence, Truth, is the law of our being.

 FOREIGN PROPAGANDA AND SAROJINI DEVI
 I am no believer in foreign propaganda as it is commonly understood, i.e., in the sense of establishing an agency or even sen- ding peripatetic deputations. But the foreign propaganda that Sarojini Devi would carry on during her tour in the West would be the propaganda that would tell more than anything that could be done by an established agency whose very existence would be unknown to the indifferent and would be ignored by those whose opinion would  matter to us. Not so India’s Nightingale. She is known to the West. She would compel a hearing wherever she goes. She adds to her great eloquence and greater poetry a delicate sense of the true diplomacy that knows what to say and when to say it and that knows how to say the truth without hurting. We have every reason to expect much from her mission to the West. With the instinct of a gentlewoman she has gone with the resolution not to enter upon a direct refutation of Miss Mayo’s insolent libellibtech_29_footnotelibtech_30_footnote. Her presence and her exposition of what India is and means to her would be a complete answer to all the untruth that has been dinned into the ready ears of the American public by agencies whose one aim is to belittle India and all that is Indian.libtech_31_footnote
 RASHTRIYA STRI SABHA AND KHADIlibtech_32_footnote
 For years past this Sabha has been doing valuable propaganda for khadi among the fashionable citizens of Bombay and elsewhere through introducing artistic designs in khadi. Through this work the Sabha is supporting in the city of Bombay over 250 needy girls of all classes. It has five centres through which the work is distributed. Naturally these girls have to be paid regularly from month to month. Under the cash system insisted upon by the All-India Spinners’ Association the Sabha is obliged to pay cash for all the khadi it buys. Experience has shown the Sabha that it must insist upon cash payment if it has to pay cash for work done and khadi bought. Moreover, all the sisters who are engaged in organizing this work are volunteers. It is therefore but right that they should expect khadi lovers who
 
 patronize their labours to pay cash for the orders they send. Shrimati Perinbai Captain has addressed on behalf of the Sabha a circular letter in which she commends to the buyers of the articles prepared by the Sabha the necessity for cash payment. There is no doubt that the Sabha deserves encouragement for the philanthropic and useful  service it is rendering. Cash payment is the least encouragement that the Sabha has the right to expect. Those who buy these articles help not only the poorest among the villagers but also the needy girls of our cities.

 "
17,,AHMEDABAD AND ITS DEAF AND DUMB,"
  
 If, although I live near Ahmedabad, I hardly write anything about it, it is not because of my unwillingness but because of my inability to do so. I have often felt the urge to participate in the life of this city, but it has subsided every time. Friends  suggested  that  l should enter the municipality and work in it. I should certainly like to, but I never had the courage to try. Let no resident of Ahmedabad believe that now, on the brink of death, I have acquired that courage. I have mentioned this only in order to admit that I have still to repay the debt that I owe to Ahmedabad.
 Shri Pranshankar Desai is running a school for the deaf and dumb in Ahmedabad. I have been acquainted with it since 1915, i.e., ever since I came to live here. From that very time I have believed that such institutions should be located outside the city. This school will now move outside the city. In accordance with the wishes of Sheth Mangaldas, its foundation-stone was laid by  me  last  week.libtech_37_footnotelibtech_38_footnoteIn  my opinion, we are late by twenty years. The school was started twenty years ago. However, the choice of its site did not lie with Shri Pranshankar. It rested with the ruling deity of Ahmedabad. Speaking in today’s terminology, it depended on the temper of the city. Just as those with a religious sentiment believe that the body has a soul, simi- larly they may also attribute a soul to the physical form of the city too, and regard it as its ruling deity. As the ruling deity of Ahme- dabad is miserly, he has huddled its residents together within a small area, has kept them in insanitary surroundings and thereby polluted its air. That deity alone knows how suffocated he must feel by keeping these human beings in misery! In his essay on hygiene, Dr. Hariprasad has stated that amongst the cities of India, Ahmedabad occupies the first place so far as the death rate or, in other words, so far as
 
 insanitation is concerned.
 If the wealthy and the educated wish, they can change the face of Ahmedabad. The biggest Jain firm is in Ahmedabad. It is said that the firm of Anandji Kalyanji is wealthier than any other firm in the world which can be described as a religious body. Ahmedabad is the capital of Gujarat and it is also the headquarters of the Jains. It claims  a monopoly of compassion for all living beings. However, it has still to learn real compassion. Looking after cattle in some manner in crowded localities is a narrow form of such compassion and its least expression. The latter should be as wide as the ocean and, as the life-sustaining oxygen spreads its fragrance from the ocean all the hours of the day, so should the oxygen of compassion do and give happiness, peace and good health to human beings and all other living creatures. However, it is not Jainism alone which enjoins the gift of health. The Vaishnavas claim no less that they, too, regard it as their duty, and Islam accords no less honour to it. There are followers of these faiths too in Ahmedabad. All of them share equally in Ahmedabad’s shame.
 There is so much wealth in Ahmedabad that it could turn this capital of Gujarat of Gujarat which is famed for its beauty into physi- cally and spiritually the healthiest place in India.
 Nature has gifted Ahmedabad with such air and water that it could become a health resort. Its residents, however, pollute both  these. The hospitals, temples, schools and orphanages of Ahmedabad should be removed to places outside the city. Its narrow lanes should be relieved of the congestion in them. There should be small open spaces in the city. We ought to have fragrance spreading all around in-stead of the stink that now pervades the city.
 This task is not beyond the capacity of Ahmedabad’s citizens. It does not require crores of rupees to be spent. Moreover, it has been the experience of all cities in the world which have become prosper- ous that the amount spent is recovered twice over. It is true, of course, that the expenditure must be incurred wisely, in a spirit of charity and with pure motives. What is true of human beings is also true of cities. Their freedom lies in their own hands. The people’s attitude and public opinion must change. In order to change them, leaders must make sacrifices. One person, Chamberlain, changed the face of Birmingham. Ahmedabad, too, needs a Chamberlain of its own. Or, as in France where the soldiers of the revolution fought without a leader,
 here too, if a Chamberlain does not come forward, cannot an organi- zation like the Youth Association make sacrifices to purify the atmos- phere in Ahmedabad and make its foul air fragrant?

19,,MY NOTES,"
  
 SAROJINI DEVI
 Sarojini Devi left the shores of India last Wednesday to proceed to the United States of America. Many hope that, by establishing agencies in Europe, America and other continents or by sending our representatives there from time to time, we can present a true picture of India, to the people of the West and thereby remove the false image of our country that is being projected there, but such hopes have always been disappointed. By adopting such a course, we would be misusing public funds and the time of persons whose services could be much better utilized at home. However, if anyone’s visit to the Westcan be worth while it would certainly be that of Sarojini Devi or the great poet Rabindranath Tagore. Sarojini Devi is well known in the West through her poems. She is gifted both as a poet and as an orator. She is also eminently tactful. She knows how to say the right thing at the right place and time. She has mastered the art of speaking the truth without hurting others. Wherever she goes, people are compelled to listen to her. She won the hearts of the Englishmen in South Africa by making full use of her powers there and, through her great success, smoothed the way for the delegation led by Sir Mohammed Habi- bullah. The task there was a difficult one. But, recognizing her own
 limitations and accepting them, she avoided going into legal intri- cacies and adhered to the main facts; she thereby accomplished her task with fine success and raised the prestige of India. She will accom- plish something of a similar nature in the U.S.A. and other countries. Her very presence there will act as a reply to the falsehoods spread by Miss Mayo. Her courage is as great as her other qualities. While going abroad she requires neither a co-worker to assist her nor a secretary. She is fearless and goes wherever she wishes to. This fearlessness of hers is not only worth emulation by other women but it even puts men to shame. We can certainly hope that her Western tour will be fruitful.
 KAKA’S IMPATIENCE
 While sending me the prose-poem entitled “Yamunarani”, which appears in this issue over Kakasaheb’s signature, he writes to say:libtech_39_footnote
 Kakasaheb has become impatient to impart true education to Gujarat. If this was not the case, after having written in praise of Gangamaiya two years ago, and having postponed the praise of “Yamunarani” so far, why should he suddenly insist that it should be published in this very issue? Moreover, he has left  me  with  no freedom to refuse his request, since he has declared his intention of sending Gujarati rendering of the Sanskrit verses directly to the Dress and so bound my hands. In acting in this way, Kakasaheb has presumed that I am as impatient as he for the education of Gujarat. He was entitled to do so. Shri Nagindas and Shri Punjabhai’s sacrifices have made us both impatient. To me, the Vidyapith does not mean only the structure of bricks on the west hanks of the Sabarmati, or the handful of men and women students who receive a literary education and training in crafts in it. It is the task of the Vidyapith to spread true education among the old men and women and the boys and girls in villages. True education means a knowledge of one’s true essence and conduct which befits such knowledge. It is Kakasaheb’s aim to make such education available even to those who are illiterate. Hence this article, which was written some time ago, finds a place in Nav- ajivan now. It is intended that lovers of the language and patriotic men and women would read it, understand it and persuade others to read it or explain it to them. The article is difficult for all readers to understand. The title itself is frightening. How many of us know the
 
 Kalindi to be the river Jamuna? Only a few persons in the villages would know the Jamuna as the Yamuna. However, as with the passing of time the patriotic sentiment grows the people will be more eager to have darshan of the Ganga and the Jamuna. All cannot go there, but they will get pleasure in reading such articles which will bring the Ganga and the Jamuna to their doorsteps and give them the feeling of having actually seen the rivers. The reader would earn the same merit as by bathing in the Ganga, if he purifies himself by entering into the spirit of these articles, whereas those who live on the banks of the Ganga and pollute its waters every day may be evil-doers and be piling up sins on their heads instead of accumulating merit.
 To anyone who reads these articles in the spirit suggested above my advice is that he should keep a map beside him while reading them. The Vidyapith is preparing a dictionarylibtech_40_footnotesuch as has never been attempted in the Gujarati language, so that such articles are easily understood. Till it is in the reader’s hands, he should somehow find the meanings of words and make up his own dictionary.

20,,BLIND FAITH,"
  
 It is the khadi cause that Shri Harjivan Kotak is serving on  behalf of the Charkha Sangh in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir. But the heart of a khadi worker certainly melts at the sight of misery wher- ever he sees it. Hence, when the pilgrims to Amarnath suffered hardships due to excessive rain, he sent me a telegram. when I asked for details, I received the following reply’:libtech_41_footnote
 What a contrast between Amarnath and lorries! There was a time when pilgrims travelled on foot from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and then, after suffering many hardships, ascended Amarnath. Even in those days, there was danger to life. We have no figures about the number of people who in those days lost their dear lives while in quest of religious merit, as there were no figures about other things. That was a true pilgrimage.
 
 Today, motor-lorries unload pilgrims at the foothills of Amar- nath, just as they would unload goods and the pilgrims on their part regard it as a meritorious deed to travel in such comfort. The remain- ing distance has to be covered by foot or on horseback and this the pilgrims somehow manage to do. They would readily accept if any- one was prepared to carry them right up to their destination or go in an aeroplane if it would take them straight to the top of Amarnath.
 Thus, human beings, while hankering after comforts, undergo hardships and even court death yielding to religious sentiments. This involves blind faith. Such faith craves for happiness but is prepared to undergo hardships, whereas pure, genuine faith finds happiness in undergoing physical suffering and hence it realizes that, while reach- ing Amarnath by aeroplane satisfies one’s curiosity, it cannot  be called a pilgrimage. Those having genuine faith would go walking barefoot and would disregard thorns, heat or cold, the danger from tigers or wolves and even though they might not reach Amarnath, they would acquire the same merit. Although the four ways of travelling by plane, by car, by train or on foot are open to them, they would feel happy in choosing the fourth alternative. When people acquire such determination, their dharma would acquire an altogether new form. Then it would make no distinction between the pilgrimage to Amar- nath and that to swaraj. They would regard it as a religious merit to suffer hardships while going to Amarnath and also regard it as such to be sent to the gallows for the sake of swaraj. Those who retreat do not know their dharma.
 A servant of the people has before him the unlimited field of the people’s faith through which he can serve them. Vallabhbhai has dis- covered this. He taught the people that it was their dharma to offer non-violent resistance to the Government. The people were attracted by the word dharma; they truly found their dharma in satyagraha and they understood the true meaning of pilgrimage. True pilgrimage is within the heart, it consists in cheerfully accepting and enduring hard- ships.
 The reader will see that I have not asked for help for relieving the suffering of the pilgrims to Amarnath and I have not  even expressed sympathy for them. There is no possibility of any assistance reaching them; whatever little could be given would have been locally available. Those who have lost their lives are gone and those who have survived will be safe when they reach the foothills. The incident that
 took place at Amarnath is a common occurrence to those people who climb great mountain-peaks.

21,,HOW TO CELEEBRATE FESTIVALS,"
  
 On the occasion of the festival of Paryushan two gentlemen from Bombay have sent me a bill of exchange worth Rs. 75, for being utilized in any good cause. This sum will be used for the benefit of our Antyaja brothers and sisters. While celebrating festivals, we gen- erally waste money on ourselves, on indulging in pleasures, on good food and drink for ourselves and our friends. Instead of that, it is better to follow the practice adopted by these gentlemen and others mentioned in Navajivan. Our dharma as well as our wealth, our self-interest as well as the public good would be better served if the whole or part of the amount spent on pomp and feasts during deaths, marriages, births, etc., is saved and a half of this is given away for the service of the community. Many people are prevented from doing so only by fear of public opinion. It is to be hoped that those who are not afraid of the bogy of public opinion and have understood what I have said will follow the example mentioned above.

 ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 September 18, 1928
  	When I address someone with ‘thou’ in speaking, it is even more 	appropriate and expressive of love to do so in letters also. That is 	why sometimes you cease to be ‘you’ and become ‘thou’. True 	love does not speak and often does not even act, and yet it cannot 	but be felt. Though I thus know that ‘you’ and ‘thou’ are 	mere external forms, I have adopted a certain style of addressing 	persons in letters which I have now started following in writing to 	you children, too.  	It is quite true that these days my letters have ceased to be 	letters. Both physically and mentally I am so much tied up that I am 	unable to see even the people in the Ashram whom I want to see. And 	writing letters gets indefinitely postponed. Today I have put off  	writing several important letters and am devoting the little time 	left before the prayers to writing this.  	In my quest for truth I have realized that as for me I can find it 	only through experience, that is, not by giving up action in the 	world but by remaining non-violent while continually engaged in 	action. I have been utterly drained in getting the recent changes in 	the Ashram adopted. You know very well how much I am interested in 	women’s progress. But except for two or three there were no women 	staying in the Ashram of their own choice. Even those who do cannot 	be said to understand even cursorily the rules of the Ashram. Do all 	the men do so?  	Then what can we expect about the deeper meaning  of  the rules? 	Even I who was the author of the rules do not know their full 	meaning, though I am realizing it more and more clearly every day. 	Thinking over the problem and discussing it, I saw that in following 	and enforcing the rules and building up the Ashram we have, 	unknowingly and unintentionally but most certainly, oppressed the 	women. They could neither leave their husbands nor the Ashram. 	Though perfectly willing to stay, they are equally unable to observe 	the rules.  	It seemed to be a sin to show the slightest leniency in the 	observance of the rules if the Ashram continued in its original 	form. I regard the rules that have been framed as essential elements 	of 
 Satyagraha. In fact they have been kept a little mild so that they are within the capacity of all. Hence, as we progress towards truth, these rules should be made more stringent. I therefore felt that if we wished to keep the women with us, the Satyagraha Ashram must take a different form. Hence the Ashram will now remain only as a symbol and an ideal in our minds without any external activities. The Ashram has been therefore handed over to the new agency that has been created. The Ashram land also will be transferred to it at a nominal rent. The Ashram will thus exist at present in an almost invisible form. But as the burden on the others will in this way be lightened, that on those who have taken the vows will increase, for even in the new Udyog Mandir it is the same persons who will be working. They will have to be guardians of the vows and make their contribution to the Udyog Mandir in that spirit. The underlying hope is that if  the  Ashram inmates have the true spirit of the Ashram in them, the Udyog Mandir itself will be reborn as a more perfect institution. This is enough for the present, as I must now leave for the prayer.

         DEAR 	SISTER,     September 	19, 1928 "
28,,PRISON TREATMENT,"
  	I have read the Khan Bahadur’s letter. You should send him the 	following reply:  	‘Gandhi says that although he takes the deepest interest in the 	subject, he does not think that any useful purpose can be served by 	his expressing an opinion on the questions asked.’libtech_45_footnote  Blessings 	from  MOHANDAS  From 	the Gujarati original: C.W. 11131. Courtesy: Sarabhai Foundation       	The Director of Information in his communique dated 12th September, 	1928, has attempted a reply to the articlelibtech_46_footnotein  Young India     
 of 16th August regarding the food served out to prisoners at the Sabarmati Central Jail. He boldly says that these statements are incorrect. It is perfectly clear from the communique that he has not made the inquiry himself but his opinion is based upon the statements supplied to him by the very parties who are accused of neglect. It is unnecessary for me to refute the statement that the health statistics in the prisons of India compare favourably with the statistics of the population living outside. This is an admitted fact, for the simple reason that the laws of sanitation are undoubtedly better enforced in the prisons than outside. But better sanitation does not prove more humaneness or more consideration for the prisoners. My point is that there is absence of the human touch about the whole of the prison system. And it seems to me to be wholly beside the point to mention that the general health of the inmates of prisons is better than outside, and I claim that even this statement becomes untenable when applied to the class of prisoners from whom satyagrahis are drawn. It was open to the Director to say, if he had so chosen, that the satyagrahis knew that there would be no humanity to be found inside the prison walls. Statements such as I made in the article in question had point. Because the claim is often made that the prisoners in Indian prisons are treated humanely and that as much consideration as is possible to give to prisoners is given in these jails.
 With regard to the specific statements made in the Director’s communique I can only give extracts from the statements made by the released prisoners, every one of whom I hold to be far more reliable than all the jail authorities put together. The statements were made by the satyagrahis on their discharge from the jail in reply to my request about the treatment, and when I saw with my own eyes the shattered constitution of Sjt. Chinai whom I knew to be in possession of excellent health and when I saw a Vidyapith lad Dinkar suffering from an obstinate fever which, but for the extraordinarily good nur- sing and able medical aid he had the good fortune to receive after being discharged from the prison, might have proved fatal.
 I shall take the first extract from the statement made by Sjt. Sanmukhlal, a well-known man of Valod who got dysentery twice as a result of bad food:
 The greens served out were wretched beyond description.	Luni simply
 stank in one’s nostrils so much so that I had to discontinue taking it. When it was exhausted, radishes and a hotchpotch of dry leaves like those of cabbage,
 etc., were substituted in its place with the result that soon after many prisoners began to suffer from bowel complaints in large numbers. But nobody could muster sufficient courage to lodge a complaint about it to the Superintendent. I even heard from some prisoners that one of the prisoners was given bar-fetters for several months for making such a complaint....
 Things improved a  little after some time.	Pumpkin and onions and
 later turiya and gowar were introduced in the vegetable fare; the gowar and turiya were hard and stringy being over-ripe, but even so were picked out and regarded by the prisoners as a delicacy.
 The juwar bread was only half-baked and so full of grit that it could
 hardly be chewed and had to be swallowed. This was especially the case when the grinding stones of the flour mills were freshly dented. As a result of this food I got dysentery, almost half of our number sharing the same fate with me. Sjt. C. L. Chinai in his statement repeats the same story:
 The food did not agree with me and I began to get stomach-ache and finally had diarrhoea, sometimes getting as many as 30 or 35 motions in a day. Whenever   I took the greens they invariably gave me darrohea. Thus I began fast to lose my weight. When I complained about it to the doctor he said that I should give up taking the greens if I wanted to keep fit, which I did and from that time till the end remained on bread and water only. I did not complain about it to the Superintendent because he never paid any heed to the complaints of the prisoners regarding food. I even heard that there had been cases of prisoners being punished for making such complaints. Therefore nobody dared to take the matters before the authorities.
 Even Sjt. Ravishankar Vyas with his iron constitution was driven to say in his statement:
 The greens consisted of dry, tough, Ieathbry leaves with an admixture of pumpkin. To eat it was to court certain stomach-ache.
 Sjt. Chinai was given hard labour beyond his capacity and consequently he had attacks of giddiness, but for twenty days hecould not get the medicine that he needed. He lost over 20 lb in weight during his incarceration. Similarly, Govind Gosain who was already in a poor state of health when he was sentenced came out of jail in such a weak condition that he could scarcely keep steady on his legs.
 I have given only the briefest extracts from the statements in my possession. If the authorities are serious, I shall have much pleasure to send them all the statements and any further proof that they may need. Refutations such as the Director of Information has made, I feel sure, carry no weight with the public, certainly do not improve the
 condition of the prisoners, nor make for humaneness in the prisons. The first condition of humaneness is a little humility and a little diffi- dence about the correctness of one’s conduct and a little receptive- ness. One misses all the three in the Director’s refutation.

29,,HOW I DISCOVERED THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"
  
 A friend who has been studying the All-India Spinners’ Asso- ciation organization after having studied a centre in Karaikudi (Tamil- nad) writes:
 This (Uttukuli) is a heavy production centre for hand-spinning and weaving. I have half picked up this work here. There are about a thousand spinners. I have gone about the villages and met many of them in their own little cottages. Every day that passes makes me marvel the more as to how you discovered the spinning-wheel. I am very much tempted to ask if you could not kindly tell in the pages of Young India when and how exactly you re-discovered the wheel. It is so little and so big at the same time. It reminds me of the rain drops—each so tiny by itself but together “the mighty ocean”. Nothing is more wrong than to think that you have asked India to spin and that India has begun to spin driven to do so by you. The truth is rather that the millions in the villages have driven you to it—to be their agent for disposing of all their yarn. I am daily watching crowds of old women and girls coming with their yarn. They come with smiling faces, their precious yarn clutched to their hearts. And khadi is retouching slowly into life just those vital parts of our national being that have been touched almost into death by this most soulless of exploitations. I realize now as never before the truth of your words when you said that the world would some day accept khadi as the noblest of your works.
He is right when he says that the toiling, starving millions drove
 me to it. It was in London in 1909libtech_47_footnotelibtech_48_footnotethat I discovered the wheel. I had gone there leading a deputation from South Africa. It was then that I came in close touch with many earnest Indians—students and others. We had many long conversations about the condition of India and I saw as in a flash that without the spinningwheel there was no swaraj. I knew at once that everyone had to spin. But I did not then know the distinction between the loom and the wheel and in  Hind Swarajlibtech_49_footnotelibtech_50_footnoteused
 
 the word loom to mean the wheel. This is what I have said in the concluding chapter of the I booklet:
 We will get nothing by asking; we shall have to take what we want, and we need the requisite strength for the effort and that strength will be available to him only who:
 2. if a lawyer, will give up his profession, and take up a handloom (spinning-wheel);
 8. although a doctor, will take up a handloorn (spinning-wheel);
 10 if a wealthy man will devote his money to establishing hand looms (spinning-wheels). and encourage others to use hand-made goods by wearing them himself.
The words are as true today as they were in 1909 when the
 booklet was written. Today not only are lawyers, doctors and others spinning by way of sacrifice but they are also organizing the move- ment. But alas, they are yet far too few for the purpose of waking the millions from their helpless lethargy. The vast majority are still standing aside. I-hey seem to be waiting for a catastrophe greater than the one that is happening in front of them. They seem to await the simultaneous destruction of millions to produce in them a shock that would move them to action. Be that as it may, there is no organic swaraj until the starving millions feel its glow. They will not feel it until the living contact is established between them and us the vocal class who literally bleed them in order that we may live.
 But to return to the wheel. Though the wheel was discovered to the mental vision in 1909, it saw work only in 1918, after three years’ patient and strenuous effort. The first khadi vow (very much adulte-rated to suit the fashionable sisters of Bombay) was taken in 1919libtech_51_footnotelibtech_52_footnote. The wheel found a place in the Congress programme in 192llibtech_53_footnotelibtech_54_footnote. The history of the movement since then is an open book still being written in the lives of the two thousand odd organizers and nearly seventy thousand spinners in whose lives the wheel has brought a ray of hope. Were we not under the hypnotic and desolating spell of the city civilization, we would realize through our hearts that only a little combined, conscious and honest effort in the shape of work is required to take the wheel to every cottage in India. Multiply the return of one wheel by say one hundred million and the result will
 
 convince the most confirmed un-believer of its potency. But probably he will refuse to be willing and say:“What you say is true as an arithmetical problem, it is wholly untrue as a practical proposition” You can only take a willing horse to the trough. But a true spinner must have unlimited patience. He does not give in. The answer to the question propounded by the friend therefore perhaps should be:“The wheel is still being discovered.” I know that it shall be one day, for there are some in this country who are prepared to pay for the discovery with their lives.

 Thursday [September 20, 1928]
 HINDU-MUSLIM FIGHT IN GODHRA
 On Wednesday, I received a postcard from Godhra informing me that, in the fighting that took place there between Hindus and Muslims on the occasion of the Paryushan festival, Shri Wamanrao Mukadam, Shri Purushottamdas Shah and some other Hindus have been seriously injured. Today, that is, on Thursday, at the time of writing this, I received a telegram informing me of Shri Purushottamdas’s death. I am aware of my inability to do anything besides expressing my sympathy to the bereaved family and I am sorry on this account. Hence 1 write nothing these days on this subject near my heart. I do not believe I have the right to say anything on it. I have come to the conclusion that the medicine I have is wanted by neither side. I have no other medicine with me except non-violence and love. At present it is not possible for me to explain the efficacy of this medicine to anyone. Hence I believe and am aware that silence is proper for me. My silence is my sole contribution to the efforts for
 
 unity. But this silence does not mean indifference. As I believe in prayer, I ceaselessly pray to God to give wisdom to both the communities and ordain that unity of hearts be established among them. If this prayer is sincere, I am bound sooner or later to find some means of ending this enmity.

 Besides these, some other varieties such as shawls, saris, prints, towels, handkerchiefs, dhotis, caps, fine as well as coarse khadi of small and large widths and woollen material of various types will be sold at a discount ranging from 6_% to 12_%.

         BHAISHRI 	BHOGILAL,     September 	22, 1928 
  	This is my argument, in the fewest possible words, about my 	deliberately killing the calf.libtech_65_footnote   The 		calf was 		in great 		pain. It had 		been under doctors’ 		treatment and 		they had given up 		all hopes. 		We could 		give it 		no help. Four 		or five 		men were 		required to turn 		it on its 		side, and 		even then this caused 		it pain. In this condition, I thought that dharma lay in killing it.  I 		see dharma in 		applying to 		human beings, 		in similar circumstances, 		the rule which 		I apply 		to other 		creatures. There 		are fewer 		occasions of acting 		in that 		way towards human 		beings, because we 		have more means of 		helping them 		and more knowledge for 		doing so. 		But history tells of 		occasions, and 		we can 		imagine others, in 		which there might be 		non-violence in 		killing a 		person, in 		the same way that 		there is 		non-violence in 		an operation performed 		by a surgeon.  The 		argument that 		he who cannot create 		life has no right 		 to destroy 		it and 		that no 		one can violate 		another’s dharma does 		not apply in a case like this. That argument can be advanced only for the     
 purpose of preventing violence, that is, cruelty. It may be itself an act of violence to advance such an argument to a person about whose non-violent motives we have no doubt at all, for it is likely to confuse the reason of such a person if he is not vigilant enough and may dissuade him from performing an act of non-violence.
  It 	is necessary to 	bear three points 	in mind 	in order 	to understand 	the non-violence of 	the act in 	question: (I) 	It is ignorance 	to believe 	that every act 	of killing 	is violence. 	(2) As 	there is 	violence in 	killing, so 	also there is 	violence in inflicting 	what we regard 	as  lesser suffering. 	(3) Violence 	and non-violence 	are mental 	attitudes, they 	concern the 	feelings in 	our heart. 	A slap 	given through anger 	is pure violence, 	whereas a slap 	given to a 	person bitten by 	a snake 	to keep 	him awake 	is pure non-violence. 
 Many other arguments can be deduced from this. If you wish to ask me any question exclusively concerning dharma, please do. You can use this letter in any place and in any manner you wish to. My only aim in life is to discover dharma, know it and follow it. I do not wish to breathe a single moment if I cannot do that.

47,,ATROCITIES BY OFFICIALS,"
    
A correspondent from Dholka writes:libtech_66_footnote
 Such atrocities should be a matter of surprise, if not in India, at any rate in Gujarat. It is in the fitness of things that the Dholka Taluk Committee has undertaken the task of putting an end to the atrocities of the police. The Congress Committees are committed to such work. However, it is the least part of the work of these committees to register a complaint before the collector or to go to  the  law-courts  and demand justice. However, where this becomes inevitable, such work may certainly be done. The real task to be done is to follow the example of Bardoli. That is to say, to live among the people and give them training in fearlessness. Such training cannot be imparted by
 
 means of speeches alone, but by being fearless oneself and infecting the others with such fearlessness. In order that this feeling may spread, some kind of useful constructive activity must be carried on amidst the people, without which one cannot come into contact with them, enter into their lives and win their confidence. The fact that khadi activity is the most effective one for coming into contact with every family living within one’s area is becoming increasingly clear every day. While carrying on such activity, one must come into contact with the talati and the police as well. Since they too wear clothes, the message of khadi should reach them also. The atrocities of the police and the talatis can be ended by an appeal to their hearts.  Such atrocities will not be averted if one policeman or talati is punished. However, a change may be brought about in their conduct if they are made aware of the fact that although they hold the posts of policeman or talati, they are nevertheless the friends or rather the servants of the people. The local police and the talati of Bardoli became friendly with the people as soon as the latter became fearless. Boycott is a much better weapon of non-co-operation than either punishment or com- plaint; however, this weapon should be used only by those who know no fear. Hence I would request the Dholka Taluk Committee to continue their task of seeking justice from the law-courts or the collector if they regard this as inevitable but, at the same time, vigorously and patiently to take up the task of making the people fearless. It will find from experience while doing so that office work and constructive work cannot be combined. In trying to do the one, the other will have to be given up. It is perhaps necessary to introduce well-known leaders to the people in cases where the latter feel suppressed and timid.

48,,POLICY OF MAKING KHADI SELF-SUPPORTING,"
    
 I would like to draw the attention of readers to the article en- titled “Khadi Work in Bijolia” appearing in this issue. It has been published as it was sent by Shri Jethalal with no changes—except for a few minor verbal changes. I hope no one will be scared by the length of the article. Shri Jethalal is one of the very few persons among us who are crazy about khadi. By this word, the Gita implies one who
 loses one’s heart and soul in one’s work. The country is in dire need of persons who are wholly dedicated to the work which they have taken up as a form of public service. Moreover, in this field we have achieved success sooner in Bijolia than elsewhere. It is the duty of every worker in the cause of khadi to know how and to what extent this success has been achieved. I have published the entire article for this reason. The reader will see clearly that at the root of the success of this work lie unflinching devotion to khadi and the resultant patience and determination. The following portion of the article deserves to be noted by everybody.
 It must be stated here that we had decided to practise such discipline as if we had gone crazy about khadi, or that we did not know or understand anything except khadi. The people did not welcome the preaching of khadi; they would hesitate to commit themselves as it was something which involved action. We saw with our own eyes conditions which deprived one of one’s humanity—disease, immorality and social and political unrest. As soon as we stopped talking about our subject and the conversation turned to  other subjects, we ceased to take any interest in it. We used to think that the strength of our argument regarding khadi would be lost if we took interest in other matters.
It is only such devoted persons who joyfully put up with “the
 cold of a winter morning, the fierce heat of a summer afternoon, and the continuous downpour during the monsoon as well as knee-deep mud” that can take the message of khadi to the people. In the words of Shri Jethalal, the leisure hours of the farmer  are  the  ‘‘active season” for khadi workers and the success of the task depends upon doing what has to be done just in that particular season.

 "
49,,NATIONAL SCHOOL AT BOMBAY,"
    
 The handful of national schools which have survived in the country are comely to the eyes of a spectator even as a little lake would look beautiful in a dry arid desert. The national school at Bombay is one of these. That school has had to function in the face of many difficulties, which persist even today. The chief among them is lack of funds. There are difficulties in the way of the Vidyapith subsidizing these schools wholly under strict rules. It has been a
 policy of the Vidyapith not to provide any aid to schools where the teachers are unable to collect funds. If the Vidyapith itself  is  to become self-supporting at any time, it will have to be increasingly strict in its adherence to this rule. It is necessary to understand the meaning of the word “self-supporting” in this context. It implies a school which can meet its own expenses with ease on the strength of the reputation enjoyed by its Principal and the other teachers. The best form of self-support is for the students of such national schools to earn through their own efforts enough to meet the expenses of their schools. Such self-support is not beyond my visualization. In the United States of America, innumerable students earn enough to pay their fees and their schools subsist upon them. In India, many schools running under Government patronage bear their own expenses and those who run them earn fairly good money. The reason for this is obvious. Government-sponsored education has a set market value and the demand for this education exceeds the Government’s capacity or intention to provide it. National education has yet to have its market-value determined. If this had been done, we would have been enjoying swaraj today. However, the “self support” that I visualize is higher than that of the schools which are run under Government patronage, as it is also distinct from that which is to be found in the U.S.A.
 This country needs an industrial climate. In the education of this country, the vocational aspect should constitute its dominant part. When this takes place, the students who will go on learning a craft will support their schools through it. Shri Madhusudan Das had conceived such a plan with regard to his tannery in Cuttack. The plan was a fine one. But it did not materialize as the prevailing atmosphere in the country provided no encouragement to vocational training or a tannery. Why should not carpentry be an indispensable part of our higher education? Education without a knowledge of weaving would be comparable to the solar system without the sun. Where such trades are being properly learnt, the students should be able to meet the expenses of their own schools. For this scheme to succeed, the students should have physical strength, will-power and a favourable atmosphere created by the teachers. If a weaver could become a Kabir, why cannot other weavers become, if not Kabirs, at any rate, Gidwanis, Kripalanis or Kalelkars? If a cobbler could become a Shakespeare, why cannot other cobblers become, if not great poets, at any rate, experts in the fields of chemistry, economics and such other subjects?
 It is very necessary to understand that, by regarding vocational train- ing as something that is opposed to intellectual education, we are labouring under a great misapprehension and that thereby we are retarding the progress of the people. The Vidyapith has taken in hand the task of explaining this fact. In the mean time, those who have faith in national education should help institutions like the national school in Bombay to the best of their ability. And if the citizens of Bombay will not provide this help, who else will? I hope that no one will excuse himself on the ground that business in Bombay is slack. The citizens of Bombay may be suffering from many shortcomings, but I have not yet discerned in them that of miserliness. Hence I hope that  the patriotic citizens of Bombay will fill Acharya Gokulbhai’s purse and free him from worries.

 "
50,,COMMUNITY FEASTS,"
    
 Shri Manilal Chhatrapati writes from Jambusar to say that on the occasion of a simant in his family, he finally gathered the courage not to hold a feast for his own caste-members. I congratulate him on it. Such courage in Congress workers should not be regarded as a matter of surprise. There is only one thing that is required for developing such courage: Disregard of or unconcern at being declared outcaste. To be excommunicated implies that one cannot attend caste-feasts, etc., and one cannot marry one’s sons or daughters within that caste. When we wish to boycott all feasts, we should consider ourselves fortunate if we receive no invitations at all. Moreover, if one’s sons and daughters cannot be betrothed within one caste, cast barriers can readily be broken down. If the country is to rise, those barriers have necessarily to be done away with. Hence reformers like Shri Manilal Chhatrapati need fear nothing. These feasts reduce civilized persons to the level of aborigines, they are a crushing burden for the poor and are a blot on our country. The fact that even those who are well off long for these feasts is something certainly unbecoming. Hence, with more reformers like Manilal Chhatrapati, these customs will gradually decline. A portion of the money that is saved on such feasts should be used by reformers for public service and in the wholesome service of those who wish to remain within the bounds of the caste. Wherever the
 mahajan acts out of ignorance, it forfeits its high status and no longer deserves respect. Hence those who give donations must be careful to see that the amount given for reforms within the caste is properly utilized.

 BHAISHRI NANABHAI,
 I have your letter. I cannot decide which day is my birthday. Formerly there was only one day, now there are many days. Accor- ding to the Tilak calendar, the birthday falls on a particular date. I did not know about this at all. According to the Christian calendar, it falls on another date. According to the Sanatana, the Saur and the Sayan calendars, it falls on still other dates. And yet more methods of reckoning may be discovered in future. If everyone would celebrate the day by spinning, as you do, I would not grumble even if every day was my birthday. Bombay does not seem to agree with Kishorelal. Manilal and Sushila seem to be completely absorbed in each other in Phoenix."

    MY 	DEAR BROTHER,  September 	24, 1928 
  	Mahadev has just returned from Simla. He tells me you have written 	in the papers that I sought by every means at my disposal to keep 	Shuaib out from the Nehru Committee. I have not been follow- ing the 	disputes between you and Dr. Ansari. I have read and that cursorily 	only one of your letters to the Press. Hence my missing the above 	titbit. Well, it is news to me that I tried to keep Shuaib out. I do 
 not even remember what I said about him and others. All I know is that I never dreamt of keeping Shuaib out of anything. I have too much regard for his honesty and independence to wish to keep him out. And you ought to know my nature. I never even keep out oppo- nents and if I want to, I say so. What led you to think that I wanted to keep Shuaib out with a purpose?
 If it is merely a matter of feeling, time alone coupled with my own future conduct can cure you of the feeling.
 Having heard the story from Mahadev, I thought I owed it to you to set you right, if my word could do so.
 1 must confess that the only letter of yours to Dr. Ansari that I read, I did not like at all. I thought it was so unnecessary. But I did not feel it right to say anything to you about it. I know you to be too good not to make amends if and when you see your error. Even your errors make you lovable so long as I retain the opinion which I do, that you are truthful and fear God. Why should I worry over what I may hold to be your error, seeing that I err often enough and need the indulgence of friends and foes alike?
With love,
 Yours,

You certainly have the strength to become one.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 6268         	William R. Thurston, according to the publisher’s preface, was a 	Major in the United States army, which he served for nearly ten 	years. And, during these years, he had varied experiences in several 	parts of     
 the world, including China. During his travels he studied the effects of marriage laws and customs, as a result of which he felt the call to write a book on marriage. This book which is called Thurston’s Philosophy of Marriage and was published last year by the Tiffany Press, New York, contains only 32 pages of bold type, and can be read inside of an hour. The author has not entered into an elaborate argument but has simply set forth his conclusion with just a dash of argument to support his conclusions which the publisher truly describes as “startling”. In his foreword, the author claims to have based his con- clusions on “personal observation, data obtained from physicians, statistics of social hygiene and medical statistics,” compiled during the War. His conclusions are:
  That 	Nature never intended a 	woman to 	be bound to 	a man 	for life, and 	to be compelled to 	occupy tie 	same bed 	or habitation with him, 	night after night, 	in pregnancy 	and out, 	in order 	to earn 	her board 	and lodging, 	and to 	exercise her 	natural right to 	bear children.  That 	the daily and 	nightly juxtaposition 	of the 	male and female, which 	is a 	result of 	present marriage laws 	and customs, leads to 	unrestrained sexual 	intercourse, which 	perverts the 	natural instincts of 	both male 	and female, and 	makes partial prostitutes 	of 90% 	of all 	married women. This condition 	arises from the fact 	that married women have been led 	to believe that 	such prostitution of 	themselves is 	right and 	natural because it 	is legal, and 	that it is necessary in order to retain the affections of their husbands. 
The author then goes on to describe the effects of continual
‘‘unrestrained sexual intercourse” which I epitomize as follows:
  It 	causes the woman to become 	highly nervous, 	prematurely aged, 	diseased, irritable, restless, discontented, and 	incapable of 	properly caring for 	her children.  Among 	the poorer 	classes it leads 	to the 	propagation of 	many children who 	are not wanted.  Among 	the higher 	classes, unrestrained 	sexual intercourse 	leads to 	the practice 	of contraception 	and abortion. 	If contraceptive 	methods under the 	name of 	‘birth-control’ 	or any 	other name are 	taught to 	the majority 	of the 	women of 	the masses, 	the race 	will become generally 	diseased, demoralized, 	depraved and 	will eventually 	perish. (The 	italics are the 	author’s.) Excessive 	sexual intercourse 	drains the 	male of the 
 vitality necessary for earning a good living. At present there are approximately 2,000,000 more widows in the United States than there are widowers. Comparatively few of these are war widows. (Italics are the author’s.)
  The 	excessive sexual 	intercourse incident to 	the present married 	state develops 	in the 	minds of 	both male and 	female a 	sense of 	futility. The 	poverty of 	the world 	today, and the 	slums of 	the larger 	cities are not 	due to lack 	of profitable 	labour to be 	performed, but 	to excessive, 	unrestrained 	sexual intercourse, 	resulting from present marriage laws. (Italics are the author’s.) 
 (g) Most serious of all from the standpoint of the future of the human race is sexual intercourse during pregnancy.
 Then follows an indictment of China and India into which I need not go. This brings us to half of this booklet. The next half is devoted to the remedy.
 The central fact of the remedy is that husband and wife must always live in separate rooms, therefore, necessarily sleep in separate beds, and meet only when both desire progeny, but especially the wife. I do not intend to give the changes suggested in the marriage laws. The one thing common to all marriages throughout the world is a common room and a common bed, and this the author condemns in unmeasured terms, I venture to think, rightly. There is no doubt that much of the sensuality of our nature, whether male or female, is due to the superstition bearing a religious sanction that married people are bound to share the same bed and the same room. It has produced a mentality, the disastrous effect of which it is difficult for us, living in the atmosphere generated by that superstition, properly to estimate.
 The author is equally opposed, as we have already seen, to contraceptive methods.
 S. Ganesan, the enterprising publisher of Madras, has obtained the permission of the author to reprint the booklet for circulation in India. If he does so, the reader can possess a copy at a trifling price. He has secured also the rights of translation.
 Many of the other remedies suggested by the author are, in my opinion, not of practical use to us, and in any case require legislative sanction. But every husband and wife can make a fixed resolution from today never to share the same room or the same bed at night and to avoid sexual contact, except for the one supreme purpose for which it is intended for both man and beast. The beast observes the law invariably. Man having got the choice has grievously erred in making
 the wrong choice. Every woman can decline to have anything to do with contra-ception. Both man and woman should  know  that abstention from satisfa-ction of the sexual appetite results not  in disease but in health and vigour, provided that mind co-operates with the body. The author believes that the present condition of marriage laws “is responsible for the greater part of all the ills of the world today”. One need not share this sweeping belief with the author to come to the two final decisions I have suggested. But there can be no doubt that a large part of the miseries of today can be avoided, if we look at the relations between the sexes in a healthy and pure light and regard ourselves as trustees for the moral welfare of the future generations.

58,,ABHOY ASHRAM,"
    
 This is one of the efficient institutions of Bengal to which many young men have dedicated themselves for national  service.  The readers of Young India cannot be unfamiliar with the Abhoy Ashram as it has been noticed in these columns more than once. The report for the year 1927, now before me, is published in pamphlet form, is well illustrated, covers 35 pages, and furnishes a record of continuous progress. Dr. Suresh Chandra Banerji is the President of the governing body, and Dr. Prafulla Chandra Ghosh is its Secretary. It has 13 members   who   are   under   the   vows   of   fearlessness,   truth,   love,
 
 non-appropriation, labour, purity and patriotism. The creed of the Ashram is self-realization through the service of the motherland. Its headquarters are at Comilla, and its activities are spinning, medical relief, removal of untouchability, national education, dairying and agriculture. Khadi is the largest among these activities? Through it, the Ashram distributed last year over Rs. 66,000 among artisans, of which Rs. 28,000 went to the weavers, Rs. 27,000 to the spinners, over Rs. l,200 to women who did embroidery work upon khadi, over Rs. 3,000 to washermen and over Rs. 6,000 to tailors. Its sales amounted to over Rs. 1,42,000 during the year under notice. The khadi department was worked at a profit. The cost of production and sale was 13% of the total sales. The profit earned was over Rs. 1,200. The khadi depart- ment absorbs 63 whole-time workers, who work in 20 centres scattered throughout the province. And “as khaddar organization naturally becomes the pivot for nation building institutions to grow round it”, reading rooms, libraries, elementary schools, gymnasiums and other social service organizations are being reared up in the khadi organi- zation established by the Ashram. I must omit the very interesting details about the medical department, untouchability work, national education, etc., and commend to the reader the report itself. The re- port goes on to state that if the Ashram is to continue to grow, it requires pecuniary assistance for the various departments. The total amount is estimated at Rs. 61,000 of which Rs. 10,000 are required for the dyeing department, Rs. 40,000 for the expansion of khadi work, Rs. 3,500 for agriculture, Rs. 2,500 for dairy and Rs. 5,000 for additional buildings which a growing institution like the Abhoy Ash- ram must always need. It need hardly be mentioned that the majo-rity of the workers are all living on bare maintenance. The Ashram in fact represents the spirit of sacrifice, of which Bengal is probably among all the provinces the finest repository. I would invite the reader to procure the report, read it and give this great institution all the help he can.

62,,‘THE FIERY ORDEAL’libtech_76_footnote,"
    
 The killing of an ailing calf in the Ashram under circumstances described below having caused a great commotion in certain circles in Ahmedabad and some angry letters having been addressed to Gandhiji on the subject, Gandhiji has critically examined the question in the light of the principle of non-violence in an article in Navajivan, the substance of which is given below.	P.  
 I
 WHEN KILLING MAY BE AHIMSA
 An attempt is being made at the Ashram to run a small model dairy and tannery on behalf of the Goseva Sangha. Its work in this connection brings it up, at every step, against intricate moral dilemmas that would not arise but for the keenness to realize the Ashram ideal of seeking Truth through the exclusive means of Ahimsa.
 For instance some days back a calf having been maimed lay in agony in the Ashram. Whatever treatment and nursing was possible was given to it. The surgeon whose advice was sought in the matter declared the case to be past help and past hope. The suffering of the animal was so great that it could not even turn its side without excruciating pain.
 In these circumstances I felt that humanitylibtech_77_footnotedemanded that the agony should be ended by ending life itself. I held a preliminary discussion with the Managing Committee most of whom agreed with my view. The matter was then placed before the whole Ashram. At the discussion a worthy neighbour vehemently opposed the idea of killing even to end pain and offered to nurse the dying animal. The nursing consisted in co-operation with some of the Ashram sisters in warding the flies off the animal and trying to feed it. The ground of the friend’s opposition was that one has no right to take away life which one cannot create. His argument seemed to me to be pointless here. It
 
 would have point if the taking of life was actuated by self-interest. Finally in all humility but with the clearest of convictions I got in my presence a doctor kindly to administer the calf a quietus by means of a poison injection. The whole thing was over in less than two minutes.
 I knew that public opinion especially in Ahmedabadlibtech_78_footnotewould not approve of my action and that it would read nothing but himsa in it.
 But I know too that performance of one’s duty should be independent of public opinion. I have all along held that one is bound to act according to what to one appears to be right even though it may appear wrong to others. And experience has shown that that is the only correct course. I admit that there is always a possibility of one’s mistaking right for wrong and vice versa but often one learns to recognize wrong only through unconscious error. On the other hand if a man fails to follow the light within for fear of public opinion or any other similar reason he would never be able to know right from wrong and in the end lose all sense of distinction between the two. That is why the poet has sung:
 The pathway of love is the ordeal of fire, The shrinkers turn away from it.
The pathway of ahimsa, that is, of love, one has often to tread all
alone.
 But the question may very legitimately be put to me: Would I apply to human beings the principle I have enunciated in connection with the calf? Would I like it to be applied in my own case? My reply is yes; the same law holds good in both the cases. The law of
Just as a surgeon does not commit himsa  but practises the purest
 ahimsa when he wields his knife on his patient’s body for the latter’s benefit, similarly one may find it necessary under certain imperative circumstances to go a step further and sever life from the body in the interest  of   the sufferer.  It   may be objected that whereas the surgeon
 
 
 performs his operation to save the life of the patient, in the other case we do just the reverse. But on a deeper analysis it will be found that the ultimate object sought to be served in both the cases is the same, viz., to relieve the suffering soul within from pain. In the one case you do it by severing the diseased portion from the body, in the other you do it by severing from the soul the body that has become an  instrument of torture to it. In either case it is the relief of the soul within from pain that is aimed at, the body without the life within being incapable of feeling either pleasure or pain. Other circums- tances can be imagined in which not to kill would spell himsa, while killing would be ahimsa. Suppose for instance, that I find my daughter—whose wish at the moment I have no means of ascertain- ing—is threatened with violation and there is no way by which I can save her, then it would be the purest form of ahimsa on my part to put an end to her life and surrender myself to the fury of the incensed ruffian.
 But the trouble with our votaries of ahimsa is that they have made of ahimsalibtech_79_footnotelibtech_80_footnotea blind fetish and put the greatest obstacle in the way of the spread of true ahimsa in our midst. The current (and in my opinion, mistaken) view of ahimsa has drugged our conscience and rendered us insensible to a host of other and more insidious forms of himsa like harsh words, harsh judgments, ill-will, anger and spite and lust of cruelty; it has made us forget that there may be far more himsa in the slow torture of men and animals, the starvation and exploitation to which they are subjected out of selfish greed, the wanton humili- ation and oppression of the weak and the killing of their self-respect that we witness all around us today than in mere benevolent taking of life. Does anyone doubt for a moment that it would have been far more humane to have summarily put to death those who in the infamous lane of Amritsar were made by their torturers to crawl on their bellies like worms? If anyone desires to retort by saying that these people themselves today feel otherwise, that they are none the worse for their crawling, I shall have no hesitation in telling him that he does not know even the elements of ahimsa. There arise occasions in a man’s life when it becomes his imperative duty to meet them by laying down his life; not to appreciate this fundamental fact of man’s estate is to betray an ignorance of the foundation of ahimsa. For instance, a votary of truth would pray to God to give him death to save him from a life of falsehood. Similarly a votary of ahimsa would on bent knees implore his enemy to put him to death rather than  humiliate him or make him do things unbecoming the dignity of a
 
 human being. As the poet has sung: The way of the Lord is meant for heroes, Not for cowards.
It, is this fundamental misconception about the nature and scope
 of ahimsa, this confusion about the relative values, that is responsible for our mistaking mere non-killing for ahimsa and for the fearful amount of himsa that goes on in the name of ahimsa in our country. Let a man contrast the sanctimonious horror that is affected by the so-called votaries of ahimsa, at the very idea of  killing  an  ailing animal to cut short its agony with their utter apathy and indifference to countless cruelties that are practised on our dumb cattle world. And he will begin to wonder whether he is living in the land of ahimsa or in that of conscious or unconscious hypocrisy.
 It is our spiritual inertia, lack of moral courage—the courage to think boldly and look facts squarely in the face that is responsible for this deplorable state of affairs. Look at our pinjrapoles and goshalas, many of them represent today so many dens of torture to which as a sop to conscience we consign the hapless and helpless cattle. If they could only speak they would cry out against us and say, “Rather than subject us to this slow torture give us death.” I have often read this mute appeal in their eyes.
 To conclude then, to cause pain or wish ill to or to take the life of any living being out of anger or a selfish intent is himsa. On the other hand after a calm and clear judgment to kill or cause pain to a living being with a view to its spiritual or physical benefit from a pure, selfless intent may be the purest form of ahimsa. Each such case must be judged individually and on its own merits. The final test as to its violence or non-violence is after all the intent underlying the act.
 II
 WHEN  KILLING IS HIMSA
 I now come to the other crying problem that is confronting the Ashram today. The monkey nuisance has become very acute and an immediate solution has become absolutely necessary. The growing vegetables and fruit trees have become a special mark of attention of this privileged fraternity and are now threatened with utter destruction. In spite of all our efforts we have not yet been able to find an efficacious and at the same time non-violentlibtech_81_footnotelibtech_82_footnoteremedy for the evil.
 The matter has provoked a hot controversy in certain circles and I have received some angry letters on the subject. One of the corres-
 
 pondents has protested against the ‘‘killing of monkeys and woun- ding them by means of arrows in the Ashram”. Let me hasten to assure the reader that no monkey has so far been killed in the Ashram, nor has any monkey been wounded by means of “arrows” or other- wise as imagined by the correspondent. Attempts are undoubtedly being made to drive them away and harmless arrows have been used for the purpose.
 The idea of wounding monkeys to frighten them away seems to me unbearable though I am seriously considering the question of killing them in case it should become unavoidable. But this question is not so simple or easy as the previous one.
 I see a clear breach of ahimsa even in driving away monkeys, the breach would be proportionately greater if they have to be killed. For any act of injury done from self-interest whether amounting to killing or not is doubtless himsa.
 All life in the flesh exists by some himsa. Hence the highest religion has been defined by a negative word ahimsa. The world is bound in a chain of destruction. In other words himsa is an inherent necessity for life in the body. That is why a votary of ahimsa always prays for ultimate deliverance from the bondage of flesh.
 None, while in the flesh, can thus be entirely free from himsa because one never completely renounces the will to live. Of what use is it to force the flesh merely if the spirit refuses to cooperate? You may starve even unto death but if at the same time the mind continues to hanker after objects of the sense, your fast is a sham and a delusion. What then is the poor helpless slave to the will to live to do? How is he to determine the exact nature and the extent of himsa  he  must commit? Society has no doubt set down a standard and absolved the individual from troubling himself about it to that extent. But every seeker after truth has to adjust and vary the standard according to his individual need and to make a ceaseless endeavour to reduce the circle of himsa. But the peasant is too much occupied with the burden of his hard and precarious existence to have time or energy to think out these problems for himself and the cultured class instead of helping him chooses to give him the cold shoulder. Having become a peasant myself, I have no clear-cut road to go by and must therefore chalk out  a path for myself and possibly for fellow peasants. And the monkey nuisance being one of the multitude of ticklish problems tha stare the farmer in the face, I must find out some means by which the peasant’s crops can be safeguarded against it with the minimum amount of himsa.
I am told that the farmers of Gujarat employ special watchmen
 whose very presence scares away the monkeys and saves the peasant from the necessity of killing them. That may be but it should not be forgotten that whatever efficacy this method might have, it is clearly dependent upon some measure of destruction at some time or other. For these cousins of ours are wily and intelligent beings. The moment they discover that there is no real danger for them, they refuse to be frightened even by gun shots and only gibber and howl the more when shots are fired. Let nobody therefore imagine that the Ashram has not considered or left any method of dealing with the nuisance untried. But none of the methods that I have known up to now is free from himsa. Whilst therefore I would welcome any practical suggestions from the readers of Navajivan for coping with this problem, let the intending advisers bear in mind what I have said above and send only such solutions as they have themselves successfully tried and cause the minimum amount of injury.

 "
63,,CURING SEX OBSESSION,"
    
 It is desirable that every man and woman should carefully study the translation published in this issue of the substance of the new booklibtech_83_footnoteon marriage written by an author named Thurston. Among us, starting from boys of the age of fifteen right up to men of fifty or, in the case of girls, starting from an even younger age up to women of fifty, the belief is current that it is not possible to live without the gratification of our sexual desires. Hence both the sexes are in a continuous state of excitement. They do not trust each other and a man changes colour when he sees a woman and vice versa. Because of this, certain customs have become prevalent, as a result of which both men and women have lost their vitality and have become sickly and listless and our lives have been reduced to a state which is unworthy of human beings.
 Even in the Shastras which came into being in such an atmos- phere, such commands and beliefs are found which result in a man and a woman having to act as if they were enemies of each other.  This is so because sexual desires are aroused or there is a fear of their being aroused when a member of either sex catches a glimpse of a member of the other sex.
Because of this belief and because of the customs that have been
 
 forged on the basis of this belief, one’s life is spent in the gratification of sexual desire or in thinking about it, with the result  that  life becomes as bitter as poison.
 As a matter of fact, because, of his powers of discretion, man should have greater strength for renunciation and should be able to exercise more self-control than animals. Despite this, it is our every- day experience that man fails to observe the limits observed by ani- mals in their relationship with members of the opposite sex. Ordin- arily, the relationship between a man and a woman should be similar to that between a mother and a son, a sister and a brother or a father and a daughter. It is obvious that the relationship between husband and wife can be something in the nature only of an excep-tion, and a man would be afraid of being with a woman and vice versa only if a brother and a sister need be thus afraid. On the contrary, in actual practice even the relationship between a brother and a sister is not free from inhibitions. And they are taught to cultivate such inhibitions.
 It is absolutely necessary to save ourselves from this pitiable condition, that is, from this atmosphere polluted by sexual desire. The ignorant fear that we cannot free ourselves from this has taken deep root in us. True manliness lies in destroying it, and we should acquire the confidence that it is possible to so.
 Thurston’s little book helps greatly in such an. effort. I for one feel that this writer’s theory—that, at the root of this desire are the current beliefs regarding marriage and the customs, both in the East and in the West, based on them—is correct. For a man and a woman to sleep alone at night in one room and share a bed between them is fatal to both and is a potent means of universalizing the reign of sexual desire and making it permanent. For religious  preachers  and reformers to preach self-control when all married couples behave like this, is like trying to patch up the sky. It is not surprising that the measures adopted for practising self-control are futile  in  an atmosphere where sex is so predominant. The Shastras proclaim that the sexual desire should be indulged in only for the purpose of procreation. This commandment is being violated every moment and yet people look for other causes for the resulting diseases. This is an action similar to that of a person who, while carrying his child on his hips, searches for it in the whole town. If this fact which is clear as daylight is understood, we would do the following:
  Men 	and women would take a 	pledge today that they 	would not 	sleep in 	privacy and 	would not 	engage in 	procreation without 	mutual consent. Whenever 	possible, they should 	sleep in separate rooms. Where this is not possible due to poverty, they should sleep on 
 separate beds, set far apart, and have some friend or relation to sleep between them.
  Understanding 	parents should 	not give 	their daughter 	in marriage 	unless she is 	going to 	be provided with 	a separate 	room and 	 a separate 	bed. Marriage 	is a 	kind of 	friendship. A 	man and a 	woman become partners in 	joys and 	sorrows, so that as soon 	as they 	are married, on 	the very first night 	they should 	not give 	in to the gratification 	of their 	sexual desire and lay 	the foundation of 	the ruin 	of their 	lives. Children should be 	given such training. 
 The new, wonderful beneficent and peaceful conception that is implied in the acceptance of Thurston’s theory deserves to be pon- dered over and it is necessary to understand the changes that ought to be made in the prevalent ideas on marriage. We can profit from this discovery only if this can take place. If those who have been able to understand this discovery have children of their own, they should accordingly alter their children’s education and the atmosphere in their own homes.
 We should not require Thurston’s testimony or his support in order to realize the harmful nature of the tremendous propaganda that is being carried on at present for the use of artificial methods of birth-control side by side with the gratification of sexual desire. It is surprising how this method can be adopted in India at all. It passes my understanding how educated persons suggest this method in the prevalent enervating atmosphere in this country.

64,,MUSIC IN GUJARAT,"
    
 The reader is aware of the fact that the National Music Asso- ciation has been functioning en Ahmedabad for the last few years. Dr. Hariprasad Desai is the President of the Association and  the well-known musician Shri Narayan Moreshwar Khare, is its Secretary. This Association has been steadily carrying out its work in Gujarat. All Gujaratis are or should be aware of the fact that as compared with Bengal, Maharashtra and the Southern provinces, Gujarat lags far behind in respect of music. Not only are Gujarati men and women less musical but ordinarily even boys and girls cannot sing in tune even a simple song. It follows then that there can be no difference of opinion on the need for propagation of music. Moreover, the music that is being taught by the musician Shri Khare is fully conducive to improvement in moral standards and is steeped in the spirit of prayer.
 Although this Association gets some assistance from Ahmeda- bad, it is not enough or adequate, either because the people have not fully realized its need or, maybe, the propaganda carried on by it has not been sufficiently popular. As both Dr. Hariprasad and the musi- cian Shri Khare wish to see a simultaneous increase in financial assis- tance and in popularity and as the support from the wealthy class is meagre, they have formulated a new scheme from which I quote the following paragraph:
 I hope that the citizens of Ahmedabad will welcome this scheme and that a hundred members will be enrolled immediately. Those who wish to have any further information should write to Shri Khare at the Ashram address.libtech_84_footnote

          DEAR 	MOTILALJI,       September 	30, 1928 
  	Mahadev gave me your message. But as there was nothing de- finite to 	say and as I have been overwhelmed with work in connec-tion with the 	Ashram, I did not write to you before now.  	Mahadev tells me that you want me to attend the All-India Congress 	Committee’s meeting. What shall I do there? What can I do?  I know 	that that part of the national work is also useful, but my heart has 	gone out of it and I become more and more inclined to give my time 	to what is concisely understood as constructive work. I do not 	mention khadi alone, because I am giving such attention as I can to 	other items of constructive work not even mentioned in the Congress 	programme And I see that everywhere strength of mind has got to be 	evoked and to the extent that it is, the power of  resistance  is 	developed. Lucknow seems evidently to have left the masses untou- 	ched. Today riots are going on in Gujarat which never before knew 	Hindu-Muslim rioting. News has just arrived that a brave Ashram lad 	was nearly done to death yesterday. Whilst he was in a press 	building, the goondas broke into that building, indiscriminately 	assaulted every-    
 one who was in it and then set fire to it. A noted Vakil of Godhra was fatally wounded and Waman Rao who is a member of the Bombay Council and whom you know was seriously assaulted. Every day some fresh rioting news comes from some place or other.
 I know that in spite of all this, the constitution-building work must be done. I only want to tell you that these riots largely unfit me for such work. Indeed, I am contemplating absence even from the Congress if you could permit me to remain away. There is a double reason: the prevailing atmosphere and the decision of the Calcutta Committee to copy the Madras type of Exhibition.libtech_85_footnotelibtech_86_footnoteThe Council of the All-India Spinners’ Association has decided to abstain from being represented at that Exhibition. Much though I feel the error in using Madras Exhibition as a type, I do not want to criticize it in the public. If I go to Calcutta, my presence will either embarrass the Committee or my silence will embarrass me.
 I have now given you what is today oppressing my mind. You will now decide firstly, whether you want me for the All-India Congress Committee in Calcutta and secondly, whether you want me to attend the Congress in December.
You and Vithalbhai worked wonders in Simla.
 Yours sincerely,

67,,"INTERVIEW TO W.
K. HALLlibtech_88_footnote","
    
 [Before October, 1928]
 Mr. Hall . . . tells how he presented a series of questions to Mr. Gandhi, the first of which referred to “the choice of a life career” which would “make the greatest contribution to society”. On this point, Mr. Gandhi said:
 The vital consideration is not so much the choice of one or another profession as the achieving of self-realization. In facing
 the problem of a career, a man should emphasize, above all else, the spiritual aspects of life. With this uppermost in his thoughts, he should test his own potentialities, discover how he can best meet the peculiar needs of the local community in which he finds himself, and apply himself to meeting those needs to the utmost of his ability.
 Q. What relation should religion and character bear to education in our present-day programme?
 A. Education, character and religion should be regarded as convertible terms. There is no true education which does not tend to produce-character, and there is no true religion which does not determine character. Education should contemplate the whole life. Mere memorizing and book-learning is not education. I have no faith in the so-called systems of education which produce men of learning without the backbone one of character.
 What fitting substitute can the Western nations find for militarism?
 Militarism is essentially self-assertion. I should therefore substi- tute for self-assertion self-abnegation.
 But what is meant by the term “self-abnegation”?
 The sense in which Christ understood it: “He who loseth his life shall find it.”
 What is the way out of the present seemingly hopeless antagonism between religious factions in all parts of the world?
 Charity. We must learn toleration and respect for others. Every religion in some measure satisfies the spiritual needs of men. If a religious act, such as to tomtoming, annoys me, I should not try to have it prohibited, but should realize that it ministers to other people’s needs, and remove myself from the scene of disturbance.
 I have ceased to declare myself publicly on this issue. My views are well known. As the French proverb has it, “He who  excuses himself accuses himself”. I believe that by maintaining silence, my message is more forcibly conveyed than by constant admonition.
 
 There is, however, no need of despairing of this or any other issue where the right is involved. The world is moving on the right course. When you consider that our mortal lives are mere specks in relation to the whole of time, you may appreciate that the world may be progressing, even when progress is not apparent. I am supremely hopeful.

68,"October 1, 1928","SPEECH ON ANNIE BESANT’S BIRTHDAY, AHMEDABAD","
    
 October 1, 1928
 Speaker after speaker paid glowing tributes to Dr.  Besant,  whose  82nd birthday was celebrated here this evening; Mahatma Gandhi presided.
 Gandhiji observed that they could celebrate Dr. Besant’s birthday properly only if they followed in her footsteps. She had always put her precepts into practice and had the courage of her convictions. There was indomitable will and unflinching determination in her utterances.
 Gandhiji asked the gathering to follow Dr. Besant’s simplicity of life and her power of introspection. He declared:
 If you keep that same will-power and determination even in small things, you will achieve great things. India wants swaraj, but where is her fitness? She is in chains and only when you break those chains and become fit for it will you get swaraj, and then no power on earth can resist her.
 It was Dr. Besant, declared Mahatmaji, who bridged the gulf between religion and politics. Bereft of religion politics would be like a body without soul. Without religion swaraj would be of no avail. It was Dr. Besant, concluded Gandhiji, who had awakened India from her deep slumber. To Dr. Besant there was nothing impossible in this world. Determination, simplicity, sacrifice and penance—these were the chief characteristics in her life; and Gandhiji fervently appealed to young men of India to take a vow to put these into practice in their lives.

  	You know that the Depressed Class friends have been intending to 	build a hall and a hostel as also a school for Depressed Class chil- 	dren. They came to me when I was convalescing at Juhu. I told them 	that I would gladly interest myself in the matter if they raised 	some money themselves and I told them too that I would endeavour to 	beg some money myself. They made many attempts more or less success- 	ful and they showed me many draft copies of the trust-deed necessary 	for the purpose. The latest I enclose herewith. They leave me to 	suggest the names of other trustees beyond two from among them- 	selves. The names of the two are Sjt. Ramachandra Satvaji Nikaljey 	and Sjt. Jayaram Tabaji Gaikwad. I would like you to interest 	yourself in this matter. Go through the whole thing yourself, see 	the site, meet all the principal members and then advise me. I would 	like you also to become the Secretary of the trust and one of the 	trustees. You may suggest to me the other names. I would like you to 	see Sir Purushottamdas and ask him whether he has promised to give 	Rs. 5,000 and whether he will give that money and become one of the 	trustees. Suggest some other names also to me. I would myself 	suggest Sjt. Gokulbhai Bhatt of the Rashtriya School and Kishorelal 	Mashru- wala, Shrimati Avantikabai Gokhale, Seth Jamnalal Bajaj; 	Sjts. Jerajani and Yeshwant Prasad Desai. That would become a 	business-like trust. Sir Purushottamdas can become the Chairman. If 	Mr. Jayakar joins, he will be a good addition. But you may omit 	these names altogether and make your own original suggestions. I 	have in mind Rameshwar Birla. He may not consent to be one of the 	trustees though he has given me ample funds for this class of work, 	and for this very work too I expect from him a fairly good sum if I 	can convince him that this would be a living trust and that you or 	some person like you 
 would act as the Secretary. More you will ascertain from Sjt. Bhonsle who carries this letter.

78,,MISTAKEN HUMANITY?,"
  	I have your letter. I thank you for writing to me immediately what 	you know about the monkeys. Have you made sure that in both cases 	the nuisance can be stopped? Kindly make still more detailed inquiry 	and let me know.  Vandemataram 	from  MOHANDAS  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 227         	Sjt. Jamshed Mehta is rightly accepted as the truest man of Karachi. 	Almost every good public movement there claims him as its own. He 	devotes practically the whole of his time to public move- ments. He 	is one of the best representatives of theosophy. His honesty and 	independence are as unquestioned as his patriotism. When there- fore 	such a man commits an error of judgement or runs counter to public 	opinion, his friends feel sore at heart. Sjt. Jamshed Mehta, who is 	the President of the Karachi Municipality, seems to me to have 	committed an error of judgement. Though a lover of khadi he recently 	felt called upon to move on behalf of an absentee member a 	resolution about khadi which drew forth very strong opposition from 	the members. Another matter was his attitude about a product that 	has been introduced from Europe into India as vegetable ghee.  	Many common friends have drawn my attention to the controversy that 	has been going on in Karachi on these topics and invited me to 	express my own views on them, I suppose, in the hope that they may 	either influence the President who knows my regard for him, or if 	they do not influence him, may at least prevent some of the Karachi 	public from being misled into wrong action owing to what the 
 correspondents consider to be the erroneous views of the popular President. Whether my views produce any such influence or not, opinions on these questions of Sjt. Jamshed Mehta deserve a patient and respectful examination.
 I
 He tells me that he moved the khadi resolution in order to test the feeling of the Municipality and withdrew it when he saw that the members were opposed to it. I copy the resolution and the argument from the local Press:
 This Corporation resolves to cancel its resolution No. 304 dated 2nd July, 1924 because compulsory purchase and use of hand-spun and handwoven khaddar in all cases has frequently resulted in pure waste of Municipal money in different departments of the Municipality.
 In moving the above resolution, the President at the outset assured the house that he himself was actually in favour of popularizing the use of khadi but during the last three years the Corporation had spent no less than one lakh of rupees for encouraging this cottage industry but his honest opinion was that the poor menials wearing khadi supplied by the Corporation were undergoing great hardships. The Councillors were doing great injustice to themselves and to the ratepayers by spending such an enormous amount on khadi which did the wearers little good. It was really a cruelty to ask the sweepers to wear this heavy cloth and go in the streets. Moreover white khadi became dirty soon and the poor peons had to spend lot of money for washing. The colour was tried but found useless. The Corporation could give only two suits and they had to suffer much for keeping them clean. The President emphatically observed: “I tell you it is really a cruelty. We have spent nearly a lakh of rupees but Rs. 85,000 is really wasted. Our purpose has not been served. Unless and until we give them a better and lighter khadi of a superior quality at double the present cost, we should not think of giving khadi suits. The stuff we are now giving our peons is enough to bring tears in one’s eyes.”
 Let us examine this argument. In judging the Municipal employees as he did by his own standard, I feel that the President has done the employees and the cause of khadi a serious injustice. His judgement is very like that of a delicate lady judging the appetite of her weather-beaten guests by her own or like that of an ant measuring out a few particles of flour to the elephant and feeling that she had meted out to her guest an exact measure—we know that the measure in each case would be false. The delicate lady and the ant would be right in their measure if they had guests of the same species finding themselves in the same circumstances.
 In the Karachi case, the measure adopted by the President is wrong because the Municipal employees have not been delicately
 brought up like the mover of the resolution. The President’s measure is doubly false, first because the sweepers do not need the same fineness in their dress material as the President and secondly because they do not want the same style of dress which educated Indians have from fear, ignorance or ambition imitated from the rulers. I venture to suggest that the Councillors should revise their notions of decency and equip their employees with garments of a style in keeping with the climate and the manners of the country. They need not then fear to use the coarsest khadi. And they Will save Municipal money, promote the comfort of the employees, revive true art and will at the same time serve the poorest of their countrymen whom they cannot reach save through khadi. If the President would do unto the emplo- yees as he would that they should do unto him, let him for a moment step into their shoes and see how he would feel and his measure would be right.
 But assuming that the employees must have an unnatural uniform in order to suit Municipal vanity, it is not difficult to pick up fine khadi nowadays if the Municipality will pay the price, nor is it impossible to have khaki-coloured khadi for the purpose.
 The cheapest and the most patriotic method will be to train the girls and the boys of the Municipal schools and for the Councillors to train themselves to spin fine yarn and have it woven locally. The other citizens will then copy the patriotic and industrious example of the Councillors and if say one-third Karachi devotes only half an hour to philanthropic spinning, there would be many times more than enough khadi to clothe the employees.
 One valid objection may he taken to this course being adopted, namely that khadi thus produced will not support the paupers  in whose interest it has been recommended to public corporations. Whilst the objection is sound so far as it goes, it must not be forgotten that if any city takes up spinning in the manner suggested by me, it will be very substantial though indirect service of pauper India in that the moral effect of such sacrificial spinning will be so pervading that there will be pro-duced a spinning atmosphere that would make the irresponsive masses take to it for supplementing their present income which is admitted to he altogether inadequate for human sustenance. Where the average daily income is less than seven pice, the addition of even one pice per day will be a princely addition.
 But this may be treated as a counsel of perfection not worthy of consideration by practical business men. Anyway I know that the idealist President will not dismiss my suggestion quite so summarily. But for those who will not seriously and scientifically organize
 home-spinning in the manner suggested, I submit that no expense incurred for khadi need be considered as waste, no  discomfort  suffered on its account too much, when it is borne in mind that every pice spent upon khadi goes directly into the pockets of the needy and that even of this at least 85 per cent goes into the pockets of the poorest artisans including the semistarved spinners.
But says the President:
 Why not supply the employees with uniform made of swadeshi mill cloth and save over sixty per cent of the price paid for khadi?
 This is an argument I had least expected from Sjt. Jamshed Mehta the friend of the poor. Surely, if every Municipality gave a bounty of 60 per cent to khadi, it would not be wrong to do so assu- ming that it had the power so to do.
 And I have repeatedly shown in these pages that there can be no comparison between khadi and mill-cloth even as there can be none between the home-made chapati, however costly it may he and troublesome to make, and cheap, easily prepared machine made biscuit. Mill-cloth needs no protection or patronage from the public in the sense that khadi does. Indian mill-cloth gets preference as it ought to when khadi is unavailable at any cost, when machine-made cloth becomes a necessity and when the choice lies only between foreign cloth and swadeshi mill-cloth. Khadi it is clear must displace both. Khadi has no established market like mill-cloth. It has not even become as yet a bazaar article. Every yard of khadi bought means at Ieast eighty-five per cent in the mouths of the starving and the poor ones of India. Every yard of mill-cloth bought means more than 75 per cent in the pockets of the capitalists and less than 25 per cent in the pockets of the labourers who are never helpless, who are well able to take care of themselves, and who never starve or need starve in the sense that the helpless millions starve for whose sake khadi has been conceived. Indeed I should be surprised if the Municipal employees, whose supposed discomfort owing to wearing coarse khadi has moved the humanitarian Sjt. Jamshed Mehta to action, would not, if they were informed of the great national importance of khadi, themselves prefer it to swadeshi mill-cloth however comfortable the latter may be to wear. Khadi in my opinion is cheap at any cost so long as it functions to find work for and through work feed the millions.
 II
 Sjt. Jamshed Mehta is not only a humanitarian, he is an ardent vegetarian and dares to incur the wrath of friends for the sake of his principles. He has somehow come to the conclusion that the product known as vegetable ghee which enterprising foreign manufacturers
 have introduced into the Indian market is preferable to what passes as genuine ghee but what is according to him almost always adulterated with animal fats. Though I yield to none in my enthusiasm for vege- tarianism and personally always avoid the bazaar ghee and would, if I could get some medical encouragement or could summon sufficient strength of mind, avoid even goat’s milk ghee, I could never bring myself to use the chemically doctored vegetable product which is generally palmed off on the gullible public as ghee.
 So far as I have been able to examine medical authorities, they show that there is no effective vegetable substitute for ghee or animal fats, these being rich in vitamin A which they say is absolutely necessary for a person to keep in good health. We therefore arrive at this (for vegetarians) painful conclusion that whilst Sat adulterated ghee is bad from the vegetarian standpoint, from the medical it is harmless. The only proper course for jealous food reformers like Sjt. Jamshed Mehta is to move heaven and earth to ensure a never failing supply of pure ghee and to that end I invite him to join the Goseva Sangha if he has no other and more expeditious method of reaching the common goal. Let him municipalize the milk and ghee supply of Karachi and run an efficient Municipal dairy. Vegetable  ghee  deserves only to be boycotted at all cost. For it is itself often adulterated and unlike adulterated ghee equally often injurious to health being chemically treated and in almost every case it is worthless as a food. In this country which abounds in oil seeds, the fresh seed oils are infinitely superior to the prepared vegetable fats whose basis is mostly coconut. Everyone in India can prepare for himself good vegetable ghee from an undried cocoanut which can be procured cheap in any bazaar.

 MY DEAR MALKANI,"

 SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 October 4, 1928
  	I cannot trace your previous letter. With reference to yours of the 	27th ultimo I see that you will be free from the relief work at the 	latest at the end of this month I know that you have work for you in 	Sind, and I know too that you will make your presence felt, no 	matter where you are working. The only question is what should be 	your final choice. Of course I had set my mind upon you as the 	Secretary for the All-India Suppressed Class Association to be 	formed. But I cannot guide you in this matter. Your own 	instinct must be the best guide. After all you must make the 	choice, and therefore you must choose that work which is most to 	your liking and for which you may consider yourself to be the most 	fitted. If Sind needs you and you feel that you should bury yourself 	in Sind, I do not mind it; only you must make your final choice in 	so far as it is humanly possible.  	I note what you say about your daughter. I do not like the thing 	overmuch. But I am sure that you have done the best that was 	possible in the circumstances. If it was not tragic, I should have a 	hearty laugh over your considering the expense of Rs. 2,000 a little 	thing. We poor people of the new age consider Rs. 10 a trifle too 	much. Ramdas’s marriage cost me probably one rupee, that is, one 	or two cocoanuts and two taklis for the bride and the 	bridegroom, two copies of the Gita and two copies of the 	Bhajanavali. Rs. 2,000 in Gujarat will be considered a fairly 	large sum even outside the Ashram limits. I do not think that even 	Jamnalalji spent Rs. 2,000 over Kamala’s wedding two years ago. 	But I know that if I measured Sind by the Gujarat footrule or the 	footrule of the new age, it would be a hopelessly false measure- 	ment. I suppose, for you, it is progress from perhaps Rs. 20,000 to 	Rs. 2,000, and if you were to go from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 20, you would 	perhaps have to renounce your mother-in-law and to have a divorce 	from your wife. Considered from that point of view, Rs. 2,000 is 	perhaps not a bad bargain. I 	hope you all keep good health.

87,,‘WHAT ARE WE TO DO?’ libtech_106_footnote,"
         	Two weeks ago I wrote in Navajivan a note on the tragedy in 	Godhra, where Sjt. Purushottam Shah bravely met his death at the 	hands of his assailants, and gave the note the heading “HinduMuslim 	Fight  in  Godhra”libtech_107_footnotelibtech_108_footnote.  Several  Hindus  did  not  like  the  heading   and 	addressed angry letters asking me to correct it. I found it 	impossible to accede to their demand. Whether there is one victim or 	more, whether there is a free fight between the two communities, or 	whether one assumes the offensive and the other simply suffers, I 	should describe the event as a fight if the whole series of 	happenings were the result of a state of war between the two 	communities. Whether in Godhra or in other places, there is today a 	state of war between the two communities. Fortunately the 	countryside is still free from the war fever which is mainly 	confined to towns and cities, where, in some form or other, fighting 	is continually going on. Even the correspon- dents who have written 	to me about Godhra do not seem to deny the fact that the happenings 	arose out of the communal antagonisms that existed there.  	If the correspondents had simply addressed themselves to the 	heading, I should have satisfied myself with writing to them 	privately and written nothing in Navajivan about it. But 	there are other letters in which the correspondents have vented 	their ire on different counts. A volunteer from Ahmedabad who had 	been to Godhra writes:  You 	say that you must be silent over these quarrels. Why were you not      
 silent over the Khilafat, and why did you exhort us to join the Muslims? Why are you not silent about your principles of ahimsa? How can you justify your silence when the two communities are running at each other’s throats and the Hindus are being crushed to atoms? How does ahimsa come there? I invite your attention to two cases:
 A Hindu shopkeeper thus complained to me: “Mussalmans purchase bags of rice from my shop, often never paying for them. I cannot insist on payment, for fear of their looting my godowns. I have therefore to make an involuntary gift of about 50 to 75 maunds of rice every month.”
 Others complained: “Mussalmans invade our quarters and insult our women in our presence, and we have to sit still. If we dare to raise a protest, we are done for. We dare not even lodge A complaint against them.”
 What would you advise in such cases? How would you bring your ahimsa into play? Or even here would you prefer to remain silent?
 These and similar questions have been answered in these pages over and over again, but as they are still being raised, I had better ex- plain my views once more at the risk of repetition.
 Ahimsa is not the way of the timid or the cowardly. It is the way of the brave, ready to face death. He who perishes sword in hand is no doubt brave, but he who faces death without raising his little finger and without flinching is braver. But he who surrenders his rice bags for fear of being beaten is a coward and no votary of ahimsa. He is innocent of ahimsa. He, who for fear of being beaten, suffers the women of his household to be insulted, is not manly but just the reverse. He is fit neither to be a husband nor a father, nor a brother. Such people have no right to complain.
 These cases have nothing to do with the inveterate enmity bet- ween Hindus and Mussalmans. Where there are fools there are bound to be knaves, where there are cowards there are bound to be bullies, whether they are Hindus or Mussalmans. Such cases used to happen even before the outbreak of these communal hostilities. The question here therefore is not how to teach one of the two communities a lesson or how to humanize it, but how to teach a coward to be brave.
 If the thinking sections of both the communities realize the cowardice and folly at the back of the hostilities, we can easily end them. Both have to be brave, both have to be wise. If both or either deliberately get wise, theirs will be the way of non-violence. If both fight and learn wisdom only by bitter experience, the way will he one of violence. Either way, there is no room for cowards in a society of men, i.e., in a society which loves freedom. Swaraj is not for cowards.
 It is idle therefore to denounce ahimsa or to be angry with me on the strength of the cases cited. Ever since my experience of the
 distortion of ahimsa in Bettiah in 1921,libtech_109_footnoteI have bee nrepeating over and over again that he who cannot protect himself or his nearest and Dearest or their honour by non-violently facing death, may and ought to do so by violently dealing with the oppressor. He who can do neither of the two is a burden. He has no business to be the head of a family. He must either hide himself, or must rest content to live for ever in helplessness and be prepared to crawl like a worm at the bidding of a bully.
 I know only one way—the way of ahimsa. The way of himsa goes against my grain. I do not want to cultivate the power to incul- cate himsa. As ahimsa has no place in the atmosphere of cowardice prevailing today, I must needs be reticent over the riots we hear of from day to day. This exhibition of my helplessness cannot be to my liking. But God never ordains that only things that we like should happen and things that we do not like should not happen. In spite of the helplessness, the faith sustains me that He is the Help of the  helpless, that He comes to one’s succour only when one  throws himself on His mercy. It is because of this faith that I cherish the hope that God will one day show me a path which I may confidently commend to the people. With me the conviction is as strong as ever that willy-nilly Hindus and Mussalmans must be friends one day. No one can say how and when that will happen. The future is entirely in the hands of God. But He has vouchsafed to us the ship of Faith which alone can enable us to cross the ocean of Doubt.

 "
88,,THE TANGLE OF AHIMSAlibtech_110_footnote,"
    
 My article “The Fiery Ordeal”libtech_111_footnotehas brought down upon me the ire of many an incensed critic. Some of them seem to have made the violence of their invective against me a measure of their solicitude for ahimsa. Others, as if to test my capacity for ahimsa, have cast all decorum and propriety to the winds and have poured upon me the lava of their unmeasured and acrimonious criticism, while still some others have felt genuinely grieved at what seems to them a sad aberration on my part and have written to me letters to unburden their grief to me. I have not the time to reply to all the letters that have been sent to me, nor, do I feel it to be necessary. As for the acrimonious
 
 letters, the only possible purpose that they can serve is to provide me with some exercise in forbearance and non-violence. Leaving aside such letters, therefore, I shall here try to examine some arguments that I have been able to glean from other and soberly written communi- cations.
 I am always prepared to give my best consideration to letters that are brief and to the point and are neatly written out in ink in a clear legible hand. For I claim to be a humble seeker after truth and am conducting Navajivan not merely to teach but also to learn.
 To come now to the objections and the counsels addressed to me by my correspondents they may be summed up as follows:
l.	You should now retire from the field of ahimsa.
  You 	should confess 	that your 	views about 	ahimsa are 	imported from the West.  You 	must not express views 	even when they are correct 	if there 	is a possibility 	of their 	being misused.  If 	you believe 	in the 	law of karma 	then your killing of 	the calf was a vain attempt to interfere with the operation of that law.  What 	warrant had you for 	believing that the 	calf was 	bound not 	to recover? 	Have you 	not heard of 	cases of 	recovery after 	the doctors 	have pronounced them to 	be hopeless? 
 Whether I should retire or not from the field of ahimsa, or for the matter of that from any other field, is essentially and solely for me to judge. A man can give up a right, but he may not give up a duty without being guilty of a grave dereliction. Unpopularity and censure are often the lot of a man who wants to speak and practise the truth. I hold it to be the bounded duty of a satyagrahi openly and freely to express his opinions which he holds to be correct and of benefit to the public even at the risk of incurring popular displeasure and worse. So long as I believe my views on ahimsa to be correct, it would be a sin of omission on my part not to give expression to them.
 I have nothing to be ashamed of if my views on ahimsa are the result of my Western education. I have never tabooed all Western ideas, nor am I prepared to anathematize everything that comes from the West as inherently evil. I have learnt much from the West and I should not be surprised to find that I had learnt something about ahimsa too from the West. I am not concerned what ideas of mine are the result of my foreign contacts. It is enough for me to know that my views on ahimsa have now become a part and parcel of my being.
 I have publicly discussed my views in the matter of the calf, not necessarily because I believe them to be correct, but because they are
 to the best of my knowledge based on pure ahimsa and as such likely to throw light on the tangled problem of ahimsa.
 As for the problem of the monkeys, I have discussed it publicly, because I do not know my duty in the matter, and I am anxious to be enlightened. Let me assure the readers that my effort has not been in vain and I have already received several helpful suggestions from my correspondents. Let me further assure them that I would not proceed to the extreme length of killing unless I am absolutely driven to it. It is because I am anxious to be spared this painful necessity that I have invited suggestions for dealing with these persistent and unwelcome guests.
 I firmly believe in the law of karma, but I believe too in human endeavour. I regard as the summum bonum of life the attainment of salvation through karma by annihilating its effects by detachment. If it is a violation of the law of karma to cut short the agony of an ailing animal by putting an end to its life, it is no less so to minister to the sick or try to nurse them back to life. And yet if a man were to refuse to give medicine to a patient or to nurse him on the ground of karma, we would hold him to be guilty of inhumanity and himsa. Without there-fore entering into a discussion about the eternal controversy regarding predestination and free will I will simply say here that I deem it to be the highest duty of man to render what little service he can.
 I admit that there was no guarantee that the calf would not recover. I have certainly known cases that were pronounced  by  doctors to be hopeless and were cured afterwards. But even so I hold that a man is bound to make the utmost use of his reason, circumscribed and poor as undoubtedly it is, and to try to penetrate the mists of ignorance by its light and try to act accordingly. And that is precisely what we do in countless cases in our everyday life. But strangely paradoxical as it may seem, it is nevertheless a fact that the moment we come to think of death the very idea frightens us out of our wits and entirely paralyses our reasoning faculty, although as Hindus we ought to be the least affected by the thought of death, since from the very cradle we are brought up on the doctrines of the immortality of the spirit and the transitoriness of the body. Even if it were found that my decision to poison the calf was wrong, it could have done no harm to the soul of the animal. If I have erred I am prepared to take the consequences of my error, but I refuse to go into hysterics because by my action I possibly cut short the painful existence of a dying calf say by a couple of hours. And the rule that I have applied to the calf I am prepared to apply in the case of my own dear ones as well. Who knows how often we bring those we love
 to a premature end by our coddling, infatuation, wrong diagnosis or wrong treatment? The letters that I have received from my corres- pondents more than ever confirm me in my conviction that in our effusiveness over matters like this we forget the elementary duty of kindness, are led away from the path of true love, and discredit our ahimsa. The fear of death is thus the greatest obstacle in the way of our realizing the true nature of ahirnsa.

 SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 October 7, 1928
 MY DEAR DEVDHAR,
 This letter will serve to introduce to you Shrimati Urmila Devi who is the only surviving widowed sister of the late Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das. Her only son is studying at the Agricultural College in Poona. In order to supervise his education and be near him, she has broken up her home in Calcutta and intends to settle down in Poona. I told her that it would be better for her and would fit in with her spirit of service if she stayed at the Seva Sadan and did some work there or stayed at Professor Karve’s University, whichever she preferred or whichever was possible. I would therefore like you to discuss with Shrimati Urmila Devi the possibilities of her being able to render service and otherwise advise her. Of course she has no desire to ask you to go out of your way to accommodate her in the Seva Sadan. She would like to feel that she would really be of service to the institution if she decided to stay there at all.
 At first I thought I would give a separate letter to Prof. Karve. But whilst dictating this, I thought that I would confine myself only to this letter and leave you to introduce Shrimati Urmila Devi to Prof. Karve and let her see both the institutions and make her choice, if a choice is at all open to her. And naturally what I have said regarding the Seva Sadan applies equally to Prof. Karve’s Home.
 I have known Shrimati Urmila Devi intimately for several years and I know how eager she is for doing some service.
 Yours sincerely,

         Unrevised 	 October 8, 1928  MY 	DEAR SATIS BABU,  	I am fatigued and overworked. Arrears are increasing and they worry 	me. Hence the delay in replying.  	I was working out a solution for Hemprabha Devi and Tarini. 	Meanwhile came your letter about their disposal. I was unwilling to 	have them in the Ashram. For I knew that it did not suit her last 	time. And I could not hit upon another place. Tarini was none too 	happy in Wardha. Some place must be thought out in or near Bengal. I 	am no further forward even now.    
 How happy I should feel if they could go to Comilla. I expect you to conquer Abhoy Ashram even though the Pratishthan has to suffer or to die. Only, the death or the suffering must be conscious and voluntary, notlibtech_116_footnotelibtech_117_footnotemechanical and forced. This reflection arises out of your remarks about Utkal. So far as I can see, various organizations will come into being as khadi progresses. It is a condition of its growth. But the central or chief provincial organization has so to shape its course that by force of character and ability, it commands attention and respect. One difficulty with the Pratishthan is that it has not many self-sacrificing volunteers. This is due to your own upbrin- ging. Your own personal sacrifice was phenomenal and so you carried few with you from the environment that you had created in the chemical works. Your sudden change of life had to take root and grow into a big tree before it could cover saplings. That you have only now begun to do. I remember the conversation we had in Atrai, how you dispensed with volunteers and got paid men and made of the famine work a success. If your upbringing had been otherwise, you would have made of the work a success with the volunteers. Success of ahimsa depends upon the successful organization of voluntary wor- kers. And khadi is an attempt at working out ahimsa on a fairly large scale. We will succeed if we have patience and tapasya enough.
 I hope my meaning is clear. This letter must not put you out or dishearten you. I want it to Trace you for the future difficulties. My letter is intended to be e stimulant. When I began it, I had no notion of the length it would run to or what it was to contain.
 Let Utkal be a lesson that Dr. Ray should not be taken for any fixed programme. It is really too much to expect him to go through a sustained effort in khadi. He has too many irons in the fire, too many calls upon his time and he is now not a youth. The marvel is that he is still available for tours, etc.
 Why not Giridih again for Hemprabha Devi and Tarini? You must send them to a salubrious climate.
With love,

  	You have raised a relevant question. The feeling of high and low has 	become deeply ingrained in us. The use of the singular in speaking 	to persons is its least expression. The feeling is the least in the 	Ashram, but I see that it is there. Continue, both of you, to 	exercise self-restraint to the best of your ability.

            DEAR 	HASAN ALI,          ASHRAM,  October 	9, 1928 
  	I do not at all believe in the Shuddhi and Tabligh 	movements as they are being carried on today. But I have 	repeatedly said that if the Arya Samjists do wish to carry on 	Shuddhi nobody can stop them. Nobody can forcibly prevent 	anyone from doing a thing so long as that thing is not against 	morality.  	The moment I cease to be an optimist I shall no longer be able to 	live. Some day the Muslims are sure to co-operate. Even today many 	of them are doing so. Since 	you are determined, God will certainly help you to obser- 
 vez observe the vow of brahmacharya. Frugality in eating and non- stimulating food is a good external aid. The real means is heart-felt prayer.
 I have read some literature of theosophy, I like its general principles, but not its occult experiments. I am unable to believe in the Jagadguru and in Krishnamurti. I am not interested in the subject.
 I do not believe in the traditional practice of shraddha. But I do consider it right and necessary to pray for the dead as for the living. I see great confusion about the meaning of the law of karma. It only means that no action is without its effect. But new actions mix with the old and continually produce new and mixed results. And since the individual souls are intimately related to one another, their actions also are so related. Prayer is a new action producing good result.
 Fasting without water certainly involves greater self-control. But from the point of view of health water is necessary. One cannot fast without water for many days. I have observed in many Muslim friends during the roza that they almost wipe out the merit of fasting for sixteen hours without water by eating at night anything and every- thing in any quantity they like. Praying for God’s forgiveness does not wipe out a sin, but it purifies the soul, and if one feels genuine repentance one desists from sin in future.

103,"May 	12, 1927",GOD IS,"
         	Correspondents often invite me to answer in these pages questions 	about God. That is the penalty I have to pay for what an English 	friend calls the God stunt in Young India. Whilst I am unable to 	notice all such questions in these columns, the following compels an 	answer:  I 	read your Young India 	of May 	12, 1927, p. 	149, where you 	write, “I 	think it 	is wrong to 	expect certainties in 	this world, where all 	else but 	God that is Truth 	is an uncertainty.”libtech_122_footnote  Young 	India, p. 152: “God 	is long-suffering and patient. He lets the tyrant dig his own grave, 	only issuing grave warnings at stated intervals.”libtech_123_footnote  I 	humbly beg to say that God is not a certainty. His goal ought to be 	to spread truth all round. Why does He allow the world to be 	populated by bad people of various shades? Bad people with their 	unscrupulousness flourish all round and they spread contagion and 	thus transmit immorality and dishonesty to posterity.      
 Should not God, omniscient and omnipotent as He is, know where wickedness is by His omniscience and kill wickedness by His omnipotence there and then and nip all rascality in the bud and not allow wicked people to flourish?
 Why should God be long-suffering and be patient? What influence can He wield if He be so? The world goes on with all its rascality and dishonesty and tyranny.
 If God allows a tyrant to dig his own grave, why should He not weed out a tyrant before his tyranny oppresses the poor? Why allow full play to tyranny and then allow a tyrant, after his tyranny has ruined and demoralized thousands of people, to go to his grave?
 The world continues to be as bad as it ever was. Why have faith in that God who does not use His powers to change the world and make it a world of good and righteous men?
 I know vicious men with their vices living long and healthy lives.
 Why’ should not vicious men die early as a result of their vices?
 I wish to believe in God but there is no foundation for my faith. Kindly enlighten me through Young India and change my disbelief into belief.
 The argument is as oId as Adam. I have no original answer for it. But I permit myself to state why I believe. I am prompted to do so because of the knowledge that there are young men who are interested in my views and doings.libtech_124_footnote
 There is an indefinable mysterious Power that pervades every- thing. I feel It, though I do not see It. It is this unseen Power which makes Itself felt and yet defies all proof, because It is so unlike all that I perceive through my senses. It transcends the senses.
 But it is possible to reason out the existence of God to a limited extent. Even in ordinary affairs we know that people do not know, who rules or why and how he rules. And yet they know that there is a power that certainly rules. In my tour last year in Mysore I met many poor villagers and I found upon inquiry that they did not know who ruled Mysore. They simply said some god ruled it. If the knowledge of these poor people was so limited about their ruler, I, who am infinitely lesser than God than they than their ruler, need not be surprised if I do not realize the presence of God, the King of kings. Nevertheless I do feel as the poor villagers felt about Mysore that there is orderliness in the Universe, there is an unalterable Law governing everything and every being that exists or lives. It is not a
 
 blind law; for no blind law can govern the conduct of living beings and, thanks to the marvellous researches of Sir J. C. Bose, it can now be proved that even matter is life. That Law then which governs all life is God. Law and the Law-giver are one. I may not deny the Law or the Law-giver, because I know so little about It or Him. Even as my denial or ignorance of the existence of an earthly power will avail me noth- ing, so will not my denial of God and His Law liberate me from its operation; whereas humble and mute acceptance of divine authority makes life’s journey easier even as the acceptance of earthly rule makes life under it easier.
 I do dimly perceive that whilst everything around me is ever changing, ever dying, there is underlying all that change a living Power that is changeless, that holds all together, that creates, dissolves and recreates. That informing Power or Spirit is God. And since nothing else I see merely through the senses can or will persist, He alone is.
 And is this Power benevolent or malevolent? I see It as purely benevolent. For I can see that in the midst of death life persists, in the midst of untruth, truth persists, in the midst of darkness light persists. Hence I gather that God is Life, Truth, Light. He is Love. He is the supreme Good.
 But he is no God who merely satisfies the intellect if He ever does. God to be God must rule the heart and transform it. He must express Himself in every the smallest act of His votary. This can only be done through a definite realization more real than the five senses can ever produce. Sense perceptions can be, often are, false and dece- ptive, however real they may appear to us. Where there is realization outside the senses it is infallible. It is proved not by extraneous evidence but in the transformed conduct and character of those who have felt the real presence of God within.
 Such testimony is to be found in the experiences of an un- broken line of prophets and sages in all countries and climes. To reject this evidence is to deny oneself.
 This realization is preceded by an immovable faith. He who would in his own person test the fact of God’s presence can do so by a living faith. And since faith itself cannot be proved by extraneous evidence, the safest course is to believe in the moral government of the world and therefore in the supremacy of the moral law, the law of truth and love. Exercise of faith will be the safest where there is a clear determination summarily to reject all that is contrary to Truth and Love.
But    the    foregoing   does   not  answer   the	correspondent’s
 argument. I confess to him that I have no argument to convince him through reason. Faith transcends reason. All I can advise him to do is not to attempt the impossible. I cannot account for the existence of evil by any rational method. To want to do so is to be coequal with God. I am therefore humble enough to recognize evil as such. And I call God long-suffering and patient precisely because He permits evil in the world. I know that He has no evil in Him, and yet if there is evil, He is the author of it and yet untouched by it.
 I know too that I shall never know God if I do not wrestle with and against evil even at the cost of life itself. I am fortified in the belief by my own humble and limited experience. The purer I try to become, the nearer I feel to he to God. How much more should I be, when my faith is not a mere apology as it is today but has become as immovable as the Himalayas and as white and bright as the snows on their peaks? Meanwhile I invite the correspondent to pray with New- man who sang from experience:
 Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom, Lead Thou me on;
 The night is dark and I am far from home, Lead Thou me on;
Keep Thou my feet, I do not ask to see
 The distant scene; one step enough for me.

 MY DEAR JUGALKISHORE,
 Your letter has been in my file for a long time, but I have been helpless. It is only today whilst everybody is spinning and I have also to spin much longer than on ordinary days that I have been able to find time for overtaking the arrears of correspondence.
 Your scheme is good, but reads very ambitious. Two things occur to me. You offer Rs. 75 to those who are married and Rs. 30 to those who are unmarried. I think that you should abolish the distinction, and offer the same thing to either. You may say that you will consider the cases of married people on merits. And if the wives of such people are also prepared to do the village work, stipend may be increased. You should also have a pledge from all about khadi, un- touchability, temperance, etc. And instead of saying Hindi preferably, you should make Hindi compulsory. I think you should firmly refuse to take those who do not know Hindi well. You are quite right in saying that your sphere of work will be in the U.P. Why therefore burden yourself with any student who does not know Hindi well?
 I am not publishing the scheme just now. In any event, you do not expect me to publish it in full. Let me know if it has already been sanctioned and in working order and if it is, I will gladly notice it in the pages of Young India.
 I hope both of you are keeping well and doing well.

            MY 	DEAR BHAI,       SATYAGRAHA 	ASHRAM, SABARMATI  October 	12, 1928 
  	I have your letter of well-deserved rebuke. But it was Ganesan’s 	oversight pure and simple. The sending was not done through the 	Ashram. Ganesan is the publisher and he is a very careful man. But 	somehow or the other he forgot to send a copylibtech_128_footnoteto you. Andrews got a copy or copies because he 	cabled.  	And for your rebuke about the omission of Gabriel Isaac, I don’t 	know that the name was omitted. I have just looked up the index to 	the English translation. I missed his name in the index. But of 	course that is no proof of the fact that the name is not to be found 	in the Historylibtech_129_footnotelibtech_130_footnote. But even if it is omitted, of course it is an 	unintentional omission. I have often talked about him and his 	sacrifice  to  the Ashram people. I often think of him and his 	goodness and simplicity. But I can’t account for the omission, if 	there is an omission. I dare say that some other dear names also 	have been omitted quite unintenti- onally.  	The confusion about the jails does not much worry me. These 	inaccuracies are bound to be found when a man with a crowded past 	beyond, recalls events that happened ten years before the time when 	he begins to recall them. Is it not enough that the substance of the 	History is absolutely true and that it is free from any bias? Such 	is the testimony given by those who have read the book. And I dare 	say you too will give me the same testimony.  	Probably by this time you know the nature of the Memorial to be 	erected to the memory of Maganlal. But if you have missed that      
 number of Young India I may tell you that it is to be a khadi museum in a specially erected building worthy of Maganlal’s love for khadi and his technical knowledge. Subscriptions are coming in very slowly because of the interruption of Bardoli, which naturally absor-bed the attention of those who would otherwise have paid far more liberally to the Maganlal Memorial and that was as it should have been.
I have the beautiful Dutch postcard.
 All goes well at the Ashram which is undergoing several changes at the present moment. When they are fully developed you will know all about them through Young India. Mira has gone out touring in the spinning area. It is wonderful how she makes herself feel at home in the villages she visits. The Hindi that she has picked up is proving of good value.
 At present an Austrian couple are staying here. They are extre- mely good people. The husband is a professor in a Medical College in Graz and the wife is a fine singer and a finer philosopher. From the commencement of their marriage they have led the life of brahma- charya. The merit is all the wife’s. She says she never had any sexual desire. They are a wonderful couple in more ways than one.
 Ramdas is in Bardoli, Devdas in Delhi. Chhaganlal is here, Mahadev, Pyarelal, Subbiah and the rest of course.

 SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 October 12, 1928
 
 MY DEAR CHARLIE,
I have your letters. You will see in your copy of Young India
your article, “The Land of Rishis”libtech_131_footnotelibtech_132_footnote.
 The question of Sastri’s successor is proving very troublesome. I do not know what the Government of India is doing. But I am
 
 getting a little nervous. It is difficult to replace Sastri and, if they use the post for favourites, all the great work that Sastri has done can be easily undone.
 At the Ashram all is well except that we have the malaria of the season rather trying while it lasts.

  	I had your letter after a long lapse of time. It was therefore 	doubly welcome. I hope that this finds you in better health and that 	if there was an operation that it was quite successful and has left 	no ill effects. The 	Ashram is undergoing many changes at the present

       BHAISHRI 	PARAMANAND,  ASHRAM,  October 	13, 1928 
  	I got your letter only yesterday. All your letters are good. They 	are well reasoned and are never discourteous. There can, therefore, 	be no question of impropriety in them. However, your letters do have 	one defect. They are too long for me. I have thought about most of 	what you say, and I would therefore grasp your point even if you put 	it concisely, and if I did not understand I would ask. This preface 	was prompted by your letter, as long as a pamphlet, placed before me 	by Kakasaheb nearly fifteen days ago. I have kept it in my file, so 	I see it every day, but being much too long it remains unanswered 	for want of time. Even this I do not say as criticism of you but 	only as an explanation of my having missed reading your previous 	letter. Now the reply to your letter.libtech_134_footnote  	You must have observed  that  I  give  new  meaning  to  old words 	or enlarge  their  old  meanings.  I  do  not  do  that  arbitrarily 	or to suit my purpose, but because I think it right to do so. The 	words of poets are inexhaustible in their meaning. The word kavi 	originally meant an enlightened person. The perfectly 	enlightened person is the perfect poet. If, therefore, I do not draw 	the right meaning of old words or sayings, I would have to waste my 	energy in, starting a new religion and would also be guilty of 	killing the souls of those words. I have realized that even words 	have souls. If, therefore, you wish, you can compel me to admit that 	I may be giving a new meaning to the word ‘ahimsa’. It seems to 	me an exaggeration to describe ‘ahimsa’ as the supreme dharma in 	the sense you give to the word. But I have never quarrelled over the 	meaning of words. Hence if my purpose can be served without the word 	‘ahimsa’, I will certainly give up its use. Even 	at the time of the killing [of the calf] the risk was indeed     vide 	“Jain Ahimsa”, 	25-10-1928 
 there that people would draw wrong conclusions from my action. But I felt that the discernment of the true meaning of ahimsa had become so weak that I must do what I did even at the risk. And how could I hide having done something when the occasion required otherwise?
 As for the question about the daughter I would only say I would not kill her thinking that I would otherwise commit a sin, but I would kill her if I thought that she would ask for the gift of death if she could speak. I do not at all subscribe to the belief that under no circumstance is a person willing to give up his or her life. I smell cowardice in it and it is against the experience of many people. If man is indeed so much attached to life, he can make no progress. How then can he ever attain moksha? I have seen in innumerable cases that such attachment is very much less in other countries.
 As for the nuisance of the monkeys I see that I would again have to quarrel about the meaning of ‘ahimsa’.libtech_135_footnotelibtech_136_footnoteMay   I  leave  that discussion? How about keeping the question for a  full  discussion some time in future when we meet? I have much to say about the three principles you have put forward. If I get the time I will discuss the contents of your letter in Navajivan.

120,,A CRUEL CUSTOM,"
    
A Kathiawari gentleman writes to say:libtech_137_footnote
 This difficulty is a genuine one in all Hindu households and not only in Kathiawar. If a young husband who has become conscious of his dharma wishes to save himself, he should find a way to do so. He should politely reason with his parents and bring home to them the true nature of marriage. If he has any difficulty in convincing them, he should insist upon living apart from his wife so long as he cannot live independently. Where there is a will, there is a way. Man can add to his stature by finding out ways to solve difficultes and can also develop his human estate.

121,,COWS IN BARDOLI,"
    
A Bania gentleman from the Bardoli taluk writes to say:libtech_138_footnote
 If the above facts are true, this also should be taken up as an essential activity in the constructive work that is being done at persent in Bardoli. It has been repeatedly pointed out in Navajivan how great harm is done to an ox if it is not castrated. There is no doubt that almost an equal quantity of milk can be got from the cow as from the buffalo, but this result can be achieved only if the cow is reared in a scientific manner. On the whole, if we wish to spare ourselves the slaughter of the male buffalo, we should turn our full attention to an improvement in the breeding of cows. It can easily be proved that the cow and her progeny are far more useful than the buffalo and her progeny. We have paid no attention to the fact that successive generations of cows will become enfeebled if a cow is served by any and every ox. If the problem of the cow could be solved as a result of the great awakening in Bardoli, the people there would have significantly added to the services they have rendered through their satyagraha.

122,,SAD PLIGHT,"
    
A young man writes:libtech_139_footnote
 Though this young man has furnished his name, he wishes for a remedy through the columns of Navajivan, since there are many others like him. I have no panacea to offer. I regard this as a kind of disease. I know that many people suffer from it. I shall indicate what has benefited some persons.
 Faith in God is the most essential thing in this. And those who have this faith ask for God’s help in their helplessness and receive it. Rather than get involved in such arguments as whom should one pray
 
 to, is God free thus to help, and if He is, why does He not avert the disease before He is prayed to, since He dwells in everyone’s heart and should become aware of the disease, etc., etc., we should regard His ways as inscrutable and, following the example of others who have saved themselves by taking refuge in Him, we should have faith and offer heartfelt prayers to Him.
 Effort on our part is as essential as prayer. A prayer without effort becomes a mere show. It is empty. Mere mechanical repetition of words which do not proceed from the heart is futile. Moreover, anyone who makes an effort immediately gains self-confidence. Constant physical work is essential to such effort, no matter how light that work may be. Reading material should be such as to nurture pure thoughts. Privacy should be altogether shunned. It is imperative to give up co-habitation with one’s wife. Having taken all these measures, one should totally forget about one’s disease and, if one is constantly occupied in physical activity, one will not  even  be reminded of it.

123,,A CONUNDRUMlibtech_140_footnote,"
    
 Some fiery champions of ahimsa, who seem bent upon improving the finances of the Postal Department, inundate me with letters full of abuse, and are practising himsa in the name of ahimsa. They would if they could prolong the calf controversylibtech_141_footnotelibtech_142_footnoteindefinitely. Some of them kindly suggest that my intellect has suffered decay with the attainment of sixtieth year. Some others have expressed the regret that the doctors did not diagnose my case as hopeless when I was sent to the Sassoon Hospitallibtech_143_footnotelibtech_144_footnoteand cut short my sinful career by giving me a poison injection in which case the poor calf in the Ashram might have been spared the poison injection and the race of monkeys saved from the menace of destruction. These are only a few characteristic samples from the sheaf-fuls of ‘love-letters’ that I am receiving daily. The more I receive these letters the more confirmed I feel in the correct- ness of my decision to ventilate this thorny question in the columns of Navajivan. It never seems to have struck these good people that by
 
 “Interview to V. S. Srinivasa Sastri”, 12-1-1924
 this unseemly exhibition of spleen they merely prove their unfitness to be votaries or exponents of ahimsa and strike it at the very root. I turn however from these fulminations to one from among a batch of letters of a different order that I have received and I take  the’  following from it:
 Your exposition of the ethics of the “calf-incident” has cleared up a lot of my doubts and shed valuable light on the implications of ahimsa. But unfortunately it raises a fresh difficulty. Suppose, for instance, that a man begins to oppress a whole people and there is no other way of putting a stop to his oppression; then proceeding on the analogy of the calf, would it not be an act of ahimsa to rid society of his presence by putting him to death? Would you not regard such an act as an unavoidable necessity and therefore as one of ahimsa? In your discussion about the killing of the calf you have made the mental attitude the principal criterion of ahimsa. Would not according to this principle the destruction of proved tyrants be counted as ahimsa, since the motive inspiring the act is of the highest? You say that there is no himsa in killing off animal pests that destroy a farmer’s crops; then why should it not be ahimsa to kill human pests that threaten society with destruction and worse?
 The discerning reader will have already perceived that this correspondent has altogether missed the point of my argument. The definition of ahimsa that I have given cannot by any  stretch  of meaning be made to cover a case of manslaughter such as the corres- pondent in question postulates. I have nowhere described the unavoi- dable destruction of life that a farmer has to commit in pursuit of his calling as ahimsa. One may regard such destruction of life as unavoi- dable and condone it as such, but it cannot be spelt otherwise than as himsa. The underlying motive with the farmer is to subserve his own interest or, say, that of society. Ahimsa on the other hand rules out such interested destruction. But the killing of the calf was undertaken for the sake of the dumb animal itself. Anyway its good was the only motive.
 The problem mentioned by the correspondent in question may certainly be compared to that of the monkey nuisance. But then there is a fundamental difference between the monkey nuisance and the human nuisance. Society as yet knows of no means by which to effect  a change of heart in the monkeys and their killing may therefore be held as pardonable, but there is no evil-doer or tyrant who need be considered beyond reform. That is why the killing of a human being out of self-interest can never find a place in the scheme of ahimsa.
 To come now to the question of motive, whilst it is true that mental attitude is the crucial test of ahimsa, it is not the sole test. To
 kill any living being or thing save for his or its own interest is himsa however noble the motive may otherwise be. And a man who harbours ill-will towards another is no less guilty of himsa because for fear of society or want of opportunity, he is unable to translate his ill-will into action. A reference to both intent and deed is thus necessary in order finally to decide whether a particular act of abstention can be classed as ahimsa. After all, intent has to be inferred from a bunch  of correlated acts.

124,"October 14, 1928",LETTER TO PRABHASHANKER PATTANI,"
    
 Aso Sud 1 [October 14, 1928]libtech_145_footnote
 SUJNA BHAISHRI,
I have your letter.
 There is no question of one confined to bed spinning. Even your pledge exempts you from that obligation during illness. If you give up spinning through lethargy or on the pretext of being too busy, I would certainly have some harsh words to say, would even consider employing satyagraha against you provided I loved you enough for the purpose. I would not make any such unreasonable demand on you that even during illness you should continue spinn- ing. If, moreover, Lady Pattani is now spinning, as you say, with sincere faith, to me it is as good as your spinning. But I have doubt about her spinning with such faith. I regard your certificate as partial, so that I myself should test her sincerity. You also tell me that she does not always wear pankoru. If one has sincere faith, would one omit to wear it any time? Pankoru is a household word among us. She may wear pankoru of any thinness she likes; I don’t take this word to mean necessarily coarse cloth. It means cloth made from yarn of whatever quality spun by our sisters and daughters. It is in your hand to spin yarn that is fine. Well, I have addressed this letter to Ramabehn,  it seems.
 Here are a few of the things I expect from you. You should pro- vide in your budget for expenditure on things manufactured in your State, as you provide for expenditure for collecting revenue. At present, that expenditure is borne by me. But how much longer can I afford it?
Please prepare and send me a report, for public or for my
 
 
 information, of the results of the law enforcing prohibition in your State.
 The State should run a model dairy in accordance with the principles explained by the Government Dairy expert in his articles in Young India. I am sure you will incur no loss through it in the end.
You can  take up these things even while you are bed-ridden.
 After you have been able to attend to them, you may ask me for more suggestions.
 But one thing I should say above all else. Leave the bed. You will think this a difficult task and so do I. But to succeed in that, along with doctors, you should consult a few quacks too. One of them is Kuvalayananda. It seems you know him. I have not been able to assess the value of his work. There is one other quack like him. He does not know anything about yoga and employs water-treatment. If you wish to collect persons of that kind round you, all I can do to help you is to inquire about them. After you have heard them, follow any of their treatments which appeals to you and seems harmless. There is no reason why you should remain bed-ridden. Am I also not one of these quacks?
 But at present I am useless. In any case, Rama is there, the greatest Vaid. If my efforts to know Him had succeeded, I would have certainly sent Him to you. But, alas, will I ever see such a lucky day?

 Silence Day, October 15, 1928
 BHAI HARIBHAU,
 I got your letter. Mirabehn has written to me in detail about the shortcomings in Jethalal’s work. She says that Jethalal has agreed to rectify the mistakes. You should go on goading him.
 I have understood the balance-sheet drawn up by you. I would advise you not to make sub-divisions of untruth. Exaggeration, half-truth, conniving at untruth—all this is untruth. We generally treat ourselves generously, whereas we ought to be parsimonious.  We  should magnify our own faults, small as mustard grains, into big mountains.
I    have    also    observed   something like   this	in	regard	to
 brahmacharya. What we often condone as violation of mental brahm- acharya is in fact violation of physical brahmacharya. For instance, unclean touch is always a violation of physical brahmacharya, and so is unclean joking. Unclean means prompted by impure thoughts.
 I need not say this to you. But it has become necessary now to explain it to all inmates of the Ashram. When I examine my own life,  I see this laxity in myself too, and that is why I caution you. The truth is that a pure life is a new birth, and one does not get it without God’s grace.

134,,SASTRI’S WORK,"
    
 A graphic letter received this week from an  eye-witness describes the now famous Klerksdorp incident of which the South African Press is full. Though nothing remains or needs to be said from the political standpoint after the full, free and frank apology from the Union Government, too much cannot be said of Sjt. Sastri’s generous and courageous behaviour in the face of a plot which might have proved fatal in its result. The letter before me shows that this true son and representative of India stood his ground without the least nervousness even when the lights were put out by the party that had come led by the Deputy Mayor to break up the meeting he was addressing. And when the firing of an explosive had made the  meeting hall too suffocating for the audience, Sjt. Sastri went outside and, as if nothing untoward or serious had happened, finished his speech without even referring to the incident. Popular as he had already become among the Europeans of South Africa before this incident, his cool courage and generous behaviour raised him still further in their estimation.
 And as he wanted no fame for himself (few men would be  found shier than Sjt. Sastri of fame), he turned his popularity to the advancement of the cause he has represented with such singular ability and success. During his all too brief stay in South Africa he has immensely raised the status of our countrymen in that part of the world. Let us hope that they will by their exemplary conduct show themselves worthy of him.
 But Sastri’s contribution to the solution of the difficult and delicate problem of South Africa does not rest merely upon what was after all an accident. We know nothing except through the results of the inner working of the ambassador’s office in which he had to exhaust all his art of a diplomacy that comes from a conviction of the correctness of one’s cause and that spurns to do or countenance any- thing wrong, mean or crooked. But we do know how unsparing he has been in the use on behalf of his cause of the gifts of eloquence, scholarship, both English and Sanskrit and great and varied learning with which nature has lavishly endowed him. He has been delivering to large and select audiences of Europeans lectures on Indian philoso- phy and culture which have stirred European imagination and softened the hard crust of prejudice which has hitherto prevented the general body of Europeans from seeing anything good in the Indian. These lectures are perhaps his greatest and the most permanent contri- bution to the Indian cause in South Africa.
It must be a serious problem for the Government of India to
 choose Sjt. Sastri’s successor. He has persistently withstood all pressure to prolong his stay in South Africa. Letter s from South Africa show me how our people dread Sjt. Sastri’s impending depar- ture. It will be a calamity if a worthy successor is not found to con- tinue the mission so successfully inaugurated and represented by Sjt. Sastri. Tradition has, I hope, been set up at the Viceregal Lodge of treating the office of India’s Agent in South Africa as neutral ground which the Government and popular parties may jointly tread. It is to be hoped that the successor to be chosen will be one  who  will commend himself equally to the Government and the people, and who will truly represent not merely the Government of India  but the people as well.

147,,‘AN ASHRAM OF RISHIS’,"
  	I had your first letter which I reached after the allotted time was 	passed and so remained silent about it. I received your second 	letter yesterday and there was no time to acknowledge it there and 	then. If you pass 24 hours with me in the Ashram you will never ask 	me for an article even of five words, let alone 100 words. It have 	neither time nor energy for anything more than what just now engages 	 my attention. You will therefore please excuse me for 	disappointing.  Yours 	sincerely,   G. HORNIMAN, 		ESQ. 		BOMBAY   From 	a photostat: S.N. 13566         	An article under this heading which has been sent by Deenaban- dhu 	Andrews has been published in Young Indialibtech_155_footnote.  	In a city called Marburg in Germany, there is a university which has 	been called an ashram of rishis by Deenabandhu in this 	article. It contains a readable description of an elderly professor 	who leads the life of a rishi there. The Vedas are studied on 	an extensive scale in the Marburg University. And the Vedas seem to 	have made such a deep impression on the lives of the professors who 	study them that they    
 themselves lead the life of rishis. Professor Otto seems to be pre-eminent amongst these professors. Here is a description of him:libtech_156_footnote
 At the house of Professor Otto, where I was staying, it was indeed a happiness to be his guest, even for a short time. He has never married. He has spent his whole life in Vedic scholarship. His hair is white, and his sister, who is nearly the same age as himself, now keeps house for him. She treated me as a mother while I was there, looking after all my wants, in a very touching manner. Almost from the very first, the glowing, ardent love for India in Professor Otto’s heart became visible to me through the animation, which lit up his face, while he related to me his experiences on his different visits. Yet his own health had suffered terribly in India. The malaria, which had infected him as early as 1912, never wholly left his system; and after his visit to India last year, he became a complete invalid for many months, Iying on his back with heart weakness. He has not even yet recovered. Yet still India remains the land of his early dreams, and he has studied every feature of India’s civilization with minutest care. Above all, he has studied deeply the Hindu religion, not only in the Vedas, Upanishads and Gita, But also both in its Puranas and in its modern forms of worship. His knowledge of Indian detail was to me amazing. This has been due to the fact, that in one way or other his whole life has been spent in research. Sanskrit is almostlibtech_157_footnotelike his own mother tongue to him; and he can use it when necessary as a second language.
I  have here translated the description of only one of the  rishis.
 We should admit with shame that the zeal, the earnestness and the per- severance with which some scholars in Europe and, especially in Germany, pursue the study of such treatises as the Vedas are some- thing almost totally absent in this country today. It is very seldom that we come across anyone emulating the life of a rishi. And where do we see now brahmacharya being readily practised solely for scholastic reasons, without any accompanying ostentation? And when a sister remains a spinster in order to be a companion to her brother and to run his home, is this not something that delights one and creates a sacred atmosphere? The other day an American  professor  had narrated his experiences in The Times of Bombay. He too is a student of Sanskrit. He writes that he had come to India full of hopes; how- ever, he had been disappointed after coming to India, seeing things for himself and meeting Sanskrit pundits. His article contains exaggerations, is full of hastily-formed judgements and is coloured by the atmosphere created by Europeans living in India. But allowing for all this, I see a grain of truth in what remains, and I feel ashamed. If
 
   India.     
 there had been a true religious awakening in us, if we had the fervour to preserve whatever was true, good and beautiful in our ancient civili- zation, our condition would have bean very different today. Rishis could live fearlessly in forests. Brahmacharya was something that they could readily practise. Today we cannot live safely even in cities. Brahmacharya appears to be something strange and wonderful to us and we shall with difficulty come across a true brahmachari if we search for one. How then can we find any women who have taken the vow of celibacy? Hence for a moment one feels that the rishis have started living in scattered corners of Europe and no longer live in this country which once was their abode.
 This is not to suggest that anyone who reads this article should go over to Germany or some other place and try to become a rishi. That too will be futile. I cannot visualize an Indian going to Germany and becoming a rishi. It is right for Indians to imitate the good qualities of a person like Professor Otto and, while remaining in India, to revitalize the institution of rishis here. It can be claimed that the Arya Samaj has made superhuman efforts in this direcuoi But those attempts are like a drop in the ocean so far as India is concerned. It is only when even mightier efforts are made that we shall be able to find the lost key to our ancient civilization

148,,SIMPLE-MINDEDED LABOURERS,"
    
 From a letter which I have received from Panchmahals,  it  appears that immoral and greedy agents lure simple-minded Rajputs and others and recruit them for serving in the tea-gardens of Assam. Thus I have received affidavits concerning twelve labourers. It is obvious from this that under the pretext of giving them work in the neighbourhood of Baroda, young men and women were taken as far away as Assam.
 The question is not whether they are happy or otherwise in Assam, but how anyone can be deceived and taken so far away. The persons who signed the affidavits inform me that they had to go leaving behind their fields. These poor persons had gone in the hope of being employed as labourers in nearby places and now they have been ensnared, and have had to leave behind their worried relations.
 There is only one way of preventing this situation. The agents deceive the labouring classes and lure them with false temptations for the sake of their commission. If this commission business is entirely
 stopped, no one will be deceived any longer. The owners of tea- gardens in Assam have the right to recruit labourers in a proper way by laying down proper conditions. Let them advertise in an honest manner. But the practice of recruiting labourers through  agents should be terminated. Agents receive commission in respect of every labourer they recruit. It is rumoured that the amount is Rs. 10 per head. Hence the agent who can deceive thirty labourers every month earns Rs. 300 a month. This is no small temptation. Hence, no matter what warning the owners give to the agents, the latter are hardly going to be deterred from practising such devious means.
 As a matter of fact, if a job is worth while and sufficiently tempting, intermediaries should not become necessary. Experience indicates that they become necessary only when a job involves hard labour, the wage is meagre, and it involves going far away from one’s home for the job. That the job may be at a distance from home is inevitable. There is no doubt, however, that labourers will go on their own if the conditions relating to wages, etc., are tempting. If the sums paid as agents’ commission, etc., are spent on providing better facilities to the labourers, the incidents of hardships to which these affidavits bear witness will be done away with.
 However, whether the owners withdraw their agents or not, public servants who come to know of these hardships should spread knowledge of the true facts among the people and warn them against being caught in the grip of the agents.

149,,MY NOTES,"
    
 WHEN SHOULD PUNISHMENT BE AWARDED?
A teacher of the Vinaymandir has put the following questionslibtech_158_footnotelibtech_159_footnote:
 In my opinion, it is simply improper to subject students to any form of punishment. By doing so, the feelings of respect and pure love that teachers should have for students disappear. The method of teaching students by punishing them is being progressively aban- doned. I know that occasions do arise when even the best of teachers cannot but inflict punishment. However, this should be an exception and should not in any way be commended. If the best of teachers has
 
 to resort to beating, this should in fact be regarded as a drawback in his art. Although an individual like Spencer has looked upon every punishment as improper, he has not always been able to put his theory into practice. After replying to this question, I need not answer in detail the other questions.
 Ordinarily, punishment is not compatible with non-violence. Of course, I can conceive of instances in which punishment cannot be regarded as such. These, however, should be regarded as irrelevant so far as teachers are concerned. For instance, if a father who is extre- mely unhappy punishes his son, it is a case of punishment given out of love. The son, too, would not regard it as an act of violence. Or, when in some cases a delirious patient has to be smacked by the person nursing him, it is not a violent act but a non-violent one. But these instances do not help teachers at all. A teacher has to develop the technique of teaching students and maintaining discipline amongst them without resorting to beating. We have before us instances of such teachers who have never beaten their students. Punishments other than corporal would be to make the student ashamed of himself, make him alternately sit down and stand up, make him hold his toes, abuse him, etc. I feel that teachers should discard all these methods.
 To repent after punishing a student in order to improve him is no repentance at all. Moreover, teachers who believe and make their students believe that punishment leads to the latter’s improvement, end up by making such a belief take root in society. And this belief creates the illusion that reforms can be brought about through violence. In my opinion, teachers of national schools who deliberately punish their students are indeed guilty of violating their pledge.
 BOLSHEVISMlibtech_160_footnote
 Q. What is your opinion about the social economics of Bolshevism and how far do you think they are fit to be copied by our country?
A.   I   must   confess  that   I   have   not  yet   been  able   fully  to
 understand the meaning of Bolshevism. All that I know is that it aims at the abolition of the institution of private property. This is only an application of the ethical ideal of non-possession in the realm of economics and if the people adopted this ideal of their own accord or could be made to accept it by means of peaceful persuasion there would be nothing like it. But from what I know of Bolshevism it not only does not preclude the use of force but freely sanctions it for the expropriation of private property and maintaining the collective State
 
 ownership of the same. And if that is so I have no hesitation in saying that the Bolshevik regime in its present form cannot last for long. For it is my firm conviction that nothing enduring can be built  on  violence. But be that as it may there is no questioning the fact that the Bolshevik ideal has behind it the purest sacrifice of countless men and women who have given up their all for its sake, and an ideal that is sanctified by the sacrifices of such master spirits as Lenin cannot go in vain: the noble example of their renunciation will be emblazoned for ever and quicken and purify the ideal as time passes.
 THE LATE SHRI DALSUKHBHAI SHAH
 Reporting the death of the Godhra lawyer, Shri Dalsukhbhai Shah, last week, Mamasaheb writes as follows:libtech_161_footnote
 I had personally known the late Dalsukhbhai. I was fully aware of his gentlemanly qualities. Following close upon the heels of Shri Purushottamdas Shah’s death, this second loss that Panchmahals has suffered is really to be regarded as too much. Both these men lent glory to the public life of Panchmahals and were true servants of the people. However, whether at the right time or untimely, all of us have to meet our death. As Mamasaheb writes, it is the task of the youth to make this loss bearable. Moreover, as Chi. Nagindas, the eldest son of the deceased, is a graduate of the Vidyapith, his responsibility has doubled. As a son he must glorify his father’s name and add to the legacy of nobility of character that the latter has left. It now becomes his special duty to add to the prestige of the Vidyapith by filling up the void among the public servants of Panchmahals. May God give him strength to full this task, give courage to the family of the deceased and grant peace to the soul of the departed.

 "
150,,JAIN AHIMSA?libtech_162_footnote,"
    
 A Jain friend who is reputed to have made a fair study of the Jain philosophy as also of the other systems has addressed me a long letter on ahimsa. It deserves a considered reply. He says in effect:
Your interpretation of ahimsa has caused confusion. In the ordi-
 
 nary sense of the term himsa means to sever life from body and not to do so is ahimsa. Refraining from causing pain to any living creature is only an extension of the original meaning which cannot by any stretch of language be made to cover the taking of life. You would not understand me to mean from this that I regard all taking of life as wrong in every possible circum- stance; for I do not think that there is any ethical principle in this world that can be regarded as absolute and admitting of no exception whatever. The maxim “Ahimsa is the highest or the supreme duty” embodies a great and cardinal truth but it does not cover the entire sum of human duties. Whilst therefore what you have termed “non-violent killing” may be a right thing it cannot be described as ahimsa.
 I am of opinion that just as life is subject to constant change and development, the meanings of terms too are constantly undergoing a process of evolution and this can be amply proved by illustrations from the history of any religion. The word yajna or sacrifice in the Hindu religion for instance is an illustration in point. Sir J. C. Bose’s discoveries are today revolutionizing the accepted connotations of biological terms. Similarly if we will fully realize ahimsa we may not fight shy of discovering fresh implications of the doctrine of ahimsa. We cannot improve upon the celebrated maxim, “Ahimsa is the  highest or the supreme duty” but we are bound, if we would retain our spiritual inheritance, to explore the implications of this great and universal doctrine. But I am not particular about names. I do not mind whether the taking of life in the circumstances I have mentioned is called ahimsa or not, so long as its correctness is conceded.
Another poser mentioned by this friend is as  follows:
 I have been unable to follow you in your description of the imaginary killing of your daughter in the hypothetical circumstances described by you.libtech_163_footnote It may be right to kill the ruffian in such a case, but what fault has the poor daughter committed? Would you regard the pollution of the poor victim as a disgrace to be avoided by death? Don’t you think that in such circumstances even if the poor girl for fear of public ignominy and shame begs to be put out of life, it would be your duty to dissuade her from her wish? As for me, I do not see the slightest difference between a case of dishonour, rape, and a case in which one has had one’s limbs cut off by force.
 My reason for putting my daughter to death in circumstances mentioned by me would not be that I feared her being polluted but that she herself would have wished death if she could express her desire. If my daughter wanted to be put out of life because she was
 
 afraid of public scandal and criticism I would certainly try to dissuade her from her wish. I would take her life only if I was absolutely certain that she would wish it. I know that Sita would have preferred death to dishonour by Ravana. And that is also what, I believe, our Shastras have enjoined. I know that it is the daily prayer of thousands of men and women that they might have death rather than dishonour. I deem it to be highly necessary that this feeling should be encoura- ged. I am not prepared to admit that the loss of chastity stands on the same footing as the loss of a limb. But I can imagine circumstances in which one would infinitely prefer death even to being maimed.
The third poser runs:
 I cannot understand why the idea of wounding a few monkeys in order to frighten away the rest instead of straightway proceeding to kill them off should be regarded as intolerable by you. Don’t you feel that the longing for life is strong even among the blind and the maimed animals? Don’t you think that the impulse to kill a living creature because one cannot bear to see its suffering is a kind of selfishness?
 The idea of wounding monkeys is unbearable to me because I know that a wounded monkey has to die a lingering death if left to itself. And if monkeys have to die at all by any act of mine, I would far rather that they were killed summarily than that they were left to die by inches. Again it beats my comprehension how I am practising ahimsa by thus wounding the monkeys instead of killing them outright. It might be a different thing if I was prepared to erect a hospital for wounded monkeys. I concede that the maimed and the blind would evince a longing for life if they have some hope of getting succour or relief. But imagine a blind, ignorant creature, with no faith in God, marooned in a desert place beyond the reach of any help and with a clear knowledge of his plight, and I cannot believe that such a creature would want to continue its existence. Nor am I prepared to admit that it is one’s duty to nurse the longing for life in all circumstances.
The fourth poser is as follows:
 The Jain view of ahimsa rests on the following three principles:
 “No matter what the circumstances are or how great the suffering, it is impossible for anyone deliberately to renounce the will to live or to wish another to put him out of pain. Therefore the taking of life cannot in any circumstances be morally justified.
 “In a world full of activities which necessitate himsa, an aspirant for salvation should try to follow ahimsa engaging in the fewest possible activities.
 “There are two kinds of himsa—direct such as that involved in
 agriculture, and indirect as that involved in the eating of agricultural pro- duce. Where one cannot altogether escape from either, a votary of ahimsa should try to avoid direct himsa.”
 I would earnestly request you critically to examine and discuss these three Jain principles of ahimsa in Navajivan. I notice that there is a vital difference between your view of ahimsa and that of the Jains. Whereas your view of ahimsa is based on the philosophy of action, that of the Jains is based on that of renunciation of action. The present is an era of action. If the principle of ahimsa be an eternal and universal principle untrammelled by time and place, it seems to me that there is a great need to stimulate the people’s mind to think out for themselves as to how the principle of ahimsa that has so far been confined to the field of renunciation only can be worked in present-day life of action and what form it will take when applied to this new environment.
 It is with the utmost reluctance that I have to enter into a dis- cussion of these principles. I know the risks of such discussion. But I see no escape from it. As for the first principle I have already expressed my opinion on it in a previous portion of this article. It is my firm conviction that the principle of clinging to life in all circum- stances betrays cowardice and is the cause of much of the himsa that goes on around us and blind adherence to this principle is bound to increase instead of reducing himsa. It seems to me that if this Jain principle is really as it is here enunciated, it is a hindrance to the attainment of salvation. For instance a person who is  constantly praying for salvation will never wish to continue his life at the expense of another’s. Only a person steeped in ignorance who cannot even remotely understand what salvation means would wish to continue life on any terms. The sine qua non of salvation is a total annihilation of all desire. How dare, then, an aspirant for salvation be sordidly selfish or wish to preserve his perishable body at all cost? Descending from the field of salvation to that of the family, one’s country, or the world of humanity, we again find innumerable instances of men and women who have dedicated themselves to the service of their family, their country or the world at large in entire disregard of their own life and this ideal of utter self-sacrifice and self-abnegation at present is being inculcated throughout the world. To hang on to life at all cost seems to me the very height of selfishness. Let however nobody understand me to mean that one may try to wean another even from such sordid egoism by force. I am adducing the argument merely to show the fallacy of the doctrine of will to live at all cost.
 As for the second, I do not know whether it can at all be described as a principle. But be that as it may, to me it represents a truism and I heartily endorse it.
 
 Coming to the third principle in the form in which it is enun- ciated by the friend, it suffers from a grave defect. The most terrible consequence of this principle to me seems to be this that if we accept it then a votary of ahimsa must renounce agriculture although he knows that he cannot renounce the fruits of agriculture and that agriculture is an indispensable condition for  the  existence  of mankind. The very idea that millions of the sons of the soil should remain steeped in himsa in order that a handful of men who live on the toil of these people might be able to practise ahimsa seems to me to be unworthy of and inconsistent with the supreme duty of ahimsa. I feel that this betrays a lack of perception of the inwardness of ahimsa. Let us see, for instance, to what it leads to if pushed to its logical conclusion. You may not kill a snake but if necessary, according to this principle, you may get it killed by somebody else. You may not yourself forcibly drive away a thief but you may employ another person to do it for you. If you want to protect the life of a child entrusted to your care from the fury of a tyrant, somebody else must bear the brunt of the tyrant’s fury for you. And you thus refrain from direct action in the sacred name of ahimsa ! This in my opinion is neither religion nor ahimsa. So long as one is not prepared to take the risks mentioned and to face the consequences, one cannot be free from fear and so long as a man has not shed all fear he is ipso facto incapable of practising ahimsa. Our scriptures tell us that ahimsa is all conquering. That before it, even the wild beasts shed their ferocity and the most hard-hearted of tyrants forget their anger. Utterly inadequate and imperfect as my own practice of ahimsa has been, it has enabled me to realize the truth of this principle. I cannot once more help expressing my doubt that Jainism subscribes to the third principle of ahimsa as enunciated by this friend. But even if Jain doctrine is just as it is stated by the friend, I must say, I for one cannot reconcile myself to it.
 Now to come to the question of renunciation versus action: I believe in the doctrine of renunciation but I hold that renunciation should be sought for in and through action. That action is the sine qua non of life in the body, that the Wheel of Life cannot go on even for a second without involving some sort of action goes  without saying. Renunciation can therefore in these circumstances only mean detachment or freedom of the spirit from action, even while the body is engaged in action. A follower of the path of renunciation seeks to attain it not by refraining from all activity but by carrying it on in a perfect spirit of detachment and altruism as a pure trust. Thus a man may engage in farming, spinning, or any other activity without departing from the path of renunciation provided one does so merely
 for selfless service and remains free from the taint of egoism or attachment. It remains for those therefore who like myself hold this view of renunciation to discover for themselves how far the principle of ahimsa is compatible with life in the body and how it can be applied to acts of everyday life. The very virtue of a dharma is that it is universal, that its practice is not the monopoly of the few, but must be the privilege of all. And it is my firm belief that the scope of Truth and ahimsa is world-wide. That is why I find an ineffable joy in dedicating my life to researches in truth and ahimsa and I invite others to share it with me by doing likewise.

152,"October 	21, 1928",LETTER TO C. L. CHINAI,"
          BHAISHRI 	CHINAI,           ASHRAM,  October 	21, 1928 
  	I have your letter. If I know the way even dimly or if others show 	it to me, I am ready to take the risk and try to bring about an 	understanding between the two. But I am afraid that today except for     
 a handful of non-co-operators, I have lost the confidence  of the Hindus and the Muslims. Both trust in physical strength. The Muslims believe that they have it. The Hindus have been trying to acquire it. Till they have had enough of this mutual fighting, neither side will sincerely wish for peace. They will not even tolerate interference by a person like me, and I can understand their not tolerating it. In such a situation, silence seems to be the best course for me. Peace will not be brought about by persons like you, who take no part in the riots or in inciting them, merely wishing for it. It is also, therefore, useless for me to think of intervening out of respect for their wish. The only way for the Hindus to overcome whatever cowardice they have in them is for such of them as are aware of the weakness to shed it and try to help others also to do so. This can be done in two ways: by striving for either physical strength or spiritual strength. There is, of course, cowardice even in physical strength. This they will hardly admit today, and it is not surprising that they will not. And if a person who has no understanding of spiritual strength also lacks physical strength, he is bound to be an impotent coward. So long as one has the strength to die and is ready to do so, one need not worry in the least. One may try to stop the fighting wherever one can. But one must know one’s limitations. We are not the judges of the world. Nor is it for us to shoulder its burden. There is an invisible power which does both. If we but surrender ourselves to it, we would know our duty from moment to moment.

 BHAISHRI GIRDHARILAL,
 I have your letter. Regarding Ashat Ikrani I can only say that it was wrong to have got him married at all. The mistake can still be rectified if the false fear of public opinion is given up. In other words that woman should be freed completely. If after that she lives with either of the two men to satisfy her passion, I would still in common usage call it adultery. In saying this I have not considered the questions of caste or community or custom. I am indifferent to both.
The problem about Makranislibtech_167_footnotelibtech_168_footnoteis easy to understand.
 I am not aware of anyone having so far tried to reform the Makranis. In Kathiawar, moreover, state affairs are carried on wholly
 
 on the basis of untruth. There is no rational policy in them. Both the rulers and the people seem to me like the Makranis. The people called Makrani about whom you write are but the external forms of the inner Makranis I am writing about. So long as that remain reality has not changed, the conditions are bound to remain as you describe them. They may change outwardly somewhat, but will not completely disappear. For that to happen both the rulers and the people must give up the Makrani spirit. I hope you will not ask me what one should do in the meantime. There is no room for such a question.

I cannot follow the path of non-violence by doing 	so. Rather than that out of a desire to be counted a great man I 	should be guilty of untruth, it is better that people should know me 	as I am. Do I not commit violence even today through weakness or 	ignorance? When I fumigate mosquitoes buzzing over puddles of water, 	they die; when I use a disinfectant to make water drinkable, the 	germs are killed. If a snake is discovered in a place where it 	cannot be caught I allow it to be killed. There is no limit to the 	violence I thus commit. But I take comfort in the thought that my 	aspiration for 
 perfect non-violence is sincere. Do ask me again if you still have any doubt.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. What you want and your wife want, to do is not birth-control but abortion. Abortion is a crime in law and in fact, it is likely also permanently to injure your wife’s health. I would therefore strongly dissuade you both from the step. Birth-control is prevention by artificial methods of conception, a  totally  different thing from abortion, which means destruction of the conceived embryo. The only way therefore I can suggest to you is to allow the pregnancy to take its own course and when the child is born to nurse it tenderly. For future protection you should resolutely decline to share the same bed or the same room with your wife and you should avoid all privacy.
 Yours sincerely,

 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 I owe a reply to your two letters. Of course if there were only corn fields, monkeys will not give so much worry as they are giving now. What I have to do is to solve the question in Such a manner as to be of use to others. It would be no solution to ask people to have only corn fields. The logical consequence of notree campaign means no rain and no fruit. The greatest need of India so far as agriculture is concerned is more trees and more fruit trees.
 So far as cattle are concerned, I quite agree with you that the ideal is to do without them. That again means doing without agricul- ture. And in so far as agriculture is concerned, it is not merely the cattle that are concerned, but there is so much inevitable destruction of life in the pursuit of agriculture. All that one can aim at is minimum of destruction and kindly treatment of cattle. I would like you not to worry about this question. And that brings me to your previous letter.
 It is in the field of khadi that your ahimsa would be displayed in its fullness, and it is there that you have to solve the question. I know that you will do nothing mechanically, nothing in haste, and things will take their own course and come rightly.
 If Hemprabhadevi can come to the Ashram and take her share in the common kitchen and the other activities to the extent that her body allows, I should feel delighted. She can come when she chooses.

163,"October 25, 1928",LETTER TO PURUSHOTTAM MAVJI,"
    
 [Before October 25, 1928]libtech_173_footnote
 BHAISHRI PURUSHOTTAM MAVJI,
 It is three o’clock in the morning. I have read your letter carefully from beginning to end. I think   the  articleslibtech_174_footnoteI  have  been writing these days answer your questions. I therefore advise you to get those articles if you do not have them and read them and ponder over them. Nevertheless, I briefly answer your questions here.
 It is not true without exception that no living creature likes to die in any circumstances. I have seen with my own eyes persons laid on the floor as dead rising up alive. I have also heard of instances of persons sitting up on the pyre. But we can act only on the basis of what we assume to be true to the best of our knowledge. The reason for killing the calf was not that I could not bear to see its pain, but that, seeing the pain, I could not help it in any other way. I assumed that it would wish to be delivered from that pain, for I have known many men who so wished to be freed in similar circumstances. One may err in assuming such a wish in a particular case, but in countless situations, Nature has provided man with no other means but to make certain assumptions. I am dictating this letter on the assumption that I shall be alive till the letter is finished and that it will give you some comfort. But it is quite conceivable that I might die before the letter was finished or, possibly, instead of giving you comfort and peace, it might pain, displease and trouble you still more. But even if that was its effect, God would forgive me, because I started writing the letter with the purest of motives.
 My answer to your question whether the calf was in unbearable pain is implied in what I have said above. But one more point is that in such matters self-deception is quite possible.
 I can also reply that in a way I knew it for certain that the calf was going to die. But I know that you mean otherwise in your letter. You have not said that I could not know for certain from its pain that  it would die. But that is what you think. However, I knew that its life was definitely going to end, if not because of the pain then through some other cause. If therefore I committed any error in acting on my assumption its only effect has been to alter the hour of death a little. It need not be necessary for me to try to become omniscient in order to save myself from the sin of altering the hour of death. Where the intention is not to give pain but to relieve pain by ending life, an
 
 ignorant man not only has the right to try but it is also incumbent on him to do so.
 Please do not have the slightest fear that I would hastily decide to kill the monkeys. But I see that I have gained much by starting the discussion, and so have other people through it. Obeying our desire to live, we knowingly destroy many living things. We know that it is wrong to destroy life in that way. I for one knew it and yet I am unable to overcome the desire to live though I know well enough that the desire is not good. I am therefore trying gradually to wean myself from it. I believe that all of us should do the same. That is our dharma too. It is quite impossible to keep the monkeys away from the fields without harassing them in some way. Even brandishing a stick at them is inflicting pain on them. Every day I drive away the mosquitoes to protect myself from their nuisance. That too is inflicting pain on them. Though knowing this, out of my desire to live, I give pain to countless creatures. I therefore daily pray to God to deliver me this very day from this body and from the necessity of having to be in a similar body which cannot be kept alive even for a moment without giving pain to some living creature, and till I am so delivered, to take from this body such service as He may wish for the good of others, at least as penance by me for the sin of living. But God’s ways are inscrutable. Even at this moment when I am praying thus, I am giving pain in some way or other to countless creatures. Innumerable creatures are eagerly waiting to settle in the space I now occupy. But what can I do? One cannot free oneself from the body merely by wishing it. To bring it about one must strive hard to live in a spirit of penance. While engaged in such an endeavour I have to accept innumerable troubles like that of the monkeys and I solve the problems according to my lights and to the best of my ability. I do not wish to deceive the world or myself in any way.
You did well of course to write the letter.

 "
164,,‘DEATH IS REST’libtech_175_footnote,"
    
 When I am overwhelmed with correspondence betraying  in  every line fear of death and consequent travesty of ahimsa, it refreshes me to come across the following beautiful dialogue a friend sent me on Maganlal Gandhi’s death:
 
 
 Tzu Kung said to Confucius,— “Master, I am aweary, and would fain have rest.”
 “In life,” replied the sage, “there is no rest.” “Shall I then never have rest?” asked the disciple.
 “You will,” said Confucius. “Behold the tombs which lie around; some magnificent, some mean. In one of these you will find rest !”
 “How wonderful is Death!” rejoined Tzu Kung. “The wise man rests, the worldly man is engulfed therein.”
 “My son,” said Confucius, “I see what you understand. Other men know life only as a boon; they do not perceive that it is a bane. They know old age as a state of weakness, they do not perceive that it is a state of ease. They know Death only as an abomination; they do not perceive that it is a state of rest.”
 “How grand,” cried Yen Tzu, “is the old conception of Death! The virtuous find rest; the wicked are engulfed therein. In death, each reverts to that from which he came. The ancients regarded death as a return to, and life as an absence from, home. And he, who forgets his home, becomes an outcaste and a byword in his generation.”
 It is not reproduced to defend the infliction of death penalty on any living being or thing. But it is given here to show that death is not  a terror in all circumstances as many correspondents contend and that it may be a deliverance in certain cases, especially when it is not inflicted as a penalty but administered as a healing balm. “Death is but a sleep and a forgetting,” says the English poet. Let us not seek to prop virtue by imagining hellish torture after death for  vice  and houris hereafter as a reward for virtue in this life. If virtue has no attraction in itself, it must be a poor thing to be thrown away on the dung heap. Nature, I am convinced, is not so cruel as she seems to us, who are so often filled with cruelty ourselves. Both heaven and hell are within us. Life after Death there is, but it is not so unlike our present experiences as either to terrify us or make us delirious with joy. “He is steadfast who rises above joy and sorrow,” says the Gita. “The wise are unaffected either by death or life.” These are but faces of the same coin.libtech_176_footnote
 The concept of non-violence in our religion is framed from the standpoint of the pain that we may cause another individual. Why should there be any outcry where death is caused either accidentally or deiberately but without any thought of causing pain? If there is not the fear of death behind that outcry, what else is it? And fear of death does not become man. Where there is this fear, supreme human
 
 endeavour in the form of non-violence is impossible.

165,,FAMINE IN THE SOUTHlibtech_177_footnote,"
    
 Salem, Coimbatore and other areas in the Tamil country whose peasant population depend on the unsteady rainfall of the central districts are having one of their very worst years. Reports from khadi centres show a terrible increase in rural unemployment. With October, the season for agricultural work generally begins and the peasant women in the khadi areas usually close down their spinning for the next four months. A certain number spin all the year round, but the majority who can work in the fields generally leave the charkhas during this time. But this year instead of a fall in the number of spinners there is an increase and a great rush for cotton at our depots.
 The reader must remember that this rush is for a wage of one anna a day.
 When will the intelligentsia of India and the well-to-do realize that the cloth that we wear is not mere covering or adornment, but a vital part of the national economy, a channel for distribution of national resources; and that clogging this is death? We can give substantial relief to the people at Pudupalayam and other famine-stricken areas where we have been enabled to set up khadi centres if only people will help us by a quick and generous consumption of the khadi that we produce. Ready consumption means room for more spinning and distribution of much needed relief among the Starving people. Sjt. Santanam desires to organize the maximum spinning in the Pudupalayam area in this period of distress there, and if we get  public sympathy and support, he hopes to organize sale of food grains and seed at cheap fixed prices, the deficit being met from famine relief fund to be raised. . .
 The way the public can help is
 by 	sending liberal orders 	for khadi;  by 	sending donations either 	for distributing 	grams free or 	at rates within 	the means 	of the 	famishing people, or 	for supporting 	spinning centres where 	initial outlay will be a necessity. 
 C. RAJAGOPALACHARI I hope that this appeal will receive a generous response. The appeal is evident]y written in a hurry and without possession of full facts. But past experience shows that in such cases a general descri- ption draws a picture less terrible than a mere narrative of ‘facts reveals. The reader will therefore not wait for a detailed report before he opens his purse-strings. I hope too to be able shortly to give a rough forecast of the requirements. Let the reader remember also that
 
 
 the best help that can be rendered” is to help to clear the stock of khadi that is being and will be manufactured. When khadi becomes current coin, though scarcity of rainfall will be always with us, there need be no distress such as would compel people to live on charity. While hand-spinning is being organized on a national scale, some charitable relief will be found necessary to meet emergencies. For all the famine-stricken people are not ready or able to spin, nor has the nation provided facilities in every village for willing spinners.

166,,TRUE HOLIDAY-MAKING,"
    
 A correspondent invites me to warn those who care against turning during the forthcoming Divali holidays good money into fireworks, bad sweets and unhygienic illuminations. I heartily res- pond. If I had my way I should have people to do housecleaning and heart cleaning and provide innocent and instructive amusements for children during these days. Fireworks I know are the delight of children, but they are so because we the elders have habituated them to fireworks. I have not known the untutored African children wanting or appreciating fireworks. They have dances instead. What can be better or healthier for children than sports and picnics to which they will take not bazaar-made sweets of doubtful value but fresh and dried fruit? Children both rich and poor may also be trained to do house-cleaning and whitewashing themselves. It will be something if they are coaxed to recognize the dignity of labour if only during holidays to begin with. But the point I wish to emphasize is that at least a part, if not the whole, of the money saved by doing away with fireworks, etc., should be given to the cause of khadi, or if that is anathema, then to any other cause in which the poorest are served. There cannot be greater joy to men and women young and old than that they think of and associate the poorest of the land with them in their holidays.

167,,"HOW WE LOST
INDIAlibtech_178_footnote","
    
 It was at Jalpaiguri just before Deshbandhu’s death that I said to a mercantile audience in reply to an address from the merchants that we had lost India through merchants and that we should regain it also
 
 4-11-1928
 through  them.libtech_179_footnotelibtech_180_footnoteIf  illustrations  of  the  truth  of  this  statement   were wanted, a striking one is furnished by the following circular letter from a mercantile association to other similar bodies:
 As you are aware, trade in Manchester piece-goods and yarn has much gone down in recent times and is still showing a marked tendency to decrease. It has been noticed that business men are not taking as keen an interest in this trade as they used to do formerly. As a result of this indifference, our countrymen are steadily losing what was as it still may be a source of great profit and income to them. The Marwari community, along with other commercial communities, being very greatly interested in the piece-goods and yarn trade, my Committee adopted a resolution in their meeting of the 7th instant, to fully investigate into the causes of its depression with a view to taking definite steps for the rehabilitation of this important branch of trade.
 As the matter is one of general interest, my Committee consider it advisable to meet the representatives of different public bodies interested in the trade in a conference in order to take concerted action if possible.
The  circular  is  dated  19th  Julylibtech_181_footnotelibtech_182_footnote,  1928.  I   do   not   know   the
 outcome of the effort. We are however just now not concerned with its result. The fact that there should be in our midst respectable bodies of merchants engaged in devising means for sustaining the trade in Manchester yarn and piece-goods, at a time when the whole country is trying to boycott all foreign cloth, is a portent which should be taken notice of by every national worker.
 Enough evidence has been adduced from time to time in these pages that India is held by the English for their commerce and that by far the largest imports consist of piece-goods. Surely no committee or commission is required to prove that so long as this exploitation of our country is permitted by us, India will be held by the British by every means at their disposal. What we need therefore above all is not so much conversion or expulsion of the British residents or rulers as the conversion of our own merchant princes and their dependents who are selling their country for their own interest.
 Nor need our merchant princes ruin themselves for the sake of the country. India will want all the quantity of the cloth and yarn that they are now importing. They have but to apply their undoubted ability to the manufacture of this quantity in our seven hundred thousand villages. In doing so they will naturally benefit themselves. I admit that they will have to give up commercial gambling, speculation and palaces out of all proportion to their surroundings, and be
 
 satisfied with an income bearing some relation to the condition of those for whom and with whom they would trade. In other words, instead of taking part as they are now doing in bleeding the villages, they would be making some tardy return to those on whom their prosperity has depended. The story of the belly and the members has an eternal application. The toiling millions are the belly. The merch- ants and others are the members. They must wither if the belly is starved. Those who have eyes can see that the belly has been shame- fully starved for a long enough period. The withering of the members must follow soon as night follows day. Let us then repent before it is too late.

 I 	have your letter.  	It was not my duty to know more about Khilafat than I did. Khilafat 	was not merely Turkey. To me Khilafat had a much deeper meaning and 	the fight for my conception of Khilafat is still going on. The only 	difference now is that we no longer have to fight over the issue 	with the British. Ask me more about this when we meet some day. I 	would not be able to explain the matter more clearly. Where there is 	trust it is not proper to ask too many questions. The important 	thing is that even the British Prime Minister had recognized the 	claim    
 of the Muslims to be just. The other Governments wanted to annex Turkey.
I will certainly now read the book on the Muslim Saint.
 As for the calf I will only say that the argument that we have no right to kill a creature the sight of which gives us pain if our personal interest is not involved does not apply here. The question here was about one’s duty to kill. Think over this difference. At the back of the American’s action was his distrust of the people. He believed that people would not look after his daughter. And the girl was not unconscious. I think there is a lot of difference between her case and that of the calf. I have not been able to read that article in Navajivan again. Do write to me if you have still not been able to see the difference. I will then try to read that aricle and find time to write to you a more detailed reply.

188,,FAMINE IN THE SOUTH,"
  From 	the Gujarati original: Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy: Beladevi Nayyar and Dr. Sushila Nayyar         	There is no end to the misery in the South. On the one hand, there 	is a severe draught around Salem, while on the other, we hear of 	floods around Kakinada. We have still to learn of the extent of 	damage caused by the floods. Meanwhile the appeal that Shri Raja- 	gopalachari has issued with regard to the drought has been published 	in Young India.libtech_203_footnotelibtech_204_footnoteFrom 	this it is seen that the crops have been damaged owing to water 	scarcity and that the farmers are worried. There is a sudden rise in 	the number of women who wish to spin. Whereas last September, 2,473 	women came to the Gandhi Ashram in order to take cotton, this 	September the number went up to 6,423. The amount of yarn received 	during the month last year was 4,785 pounds, while the amount 	received this year was 12,802 pounds.  	This activity is the purest means of helping the famine-stricken 	population and, if it is firmly established, the people would not 	suffer despite the famine. At present famine causes hardship because 	the far- mers are rendered unemployed and are without an income. 	They would be free from anxiety if they could be assured of the 	security provided by a subsidiary occupation. At this time, there 	are two ways of helping the people, first by buying the khadi that 	is produced in this famine-stricken area and second by offering them 	unconditional financial assistance. I hope to publish hereafter the 	figures relating to the famine. Those who wish to share in this 	privation now may contribute as much as they can or purchase khadi.

189,,THE GUJARAT VIDYAPITH,"
    
 It was a very important speech that the principal had prepared on the day the Diwali vacation started in the University and the Vinay- mandir and read out at the farewell gathering. Although it was a long speech, its effect was that of a brief one because it contained no figur- ative language or repetition. Its speciality lay in its crystal-clear truth. No attempt was made to hide any drawbacks or to dismiss them as unimportant. Despite this the report of this term of 112 days may be considered as very hopeful. The speech indeed contains  a  brief outline of many activities. It is obvious from this that  even  the minutest detail has not been overlooked. Amongst these, the sections dealing with agriculture and practical training in crafts cannot but attract our attention. In the field of agriculture, growing fruit trees and cotton is an altogether new experiment. The activities of ginning, carding, spinning, weaving and carpentry are the ones that are most striking amongst the crafts. At least two hours a day are devoted to the crafts. In order to do proper justice to the crafts, it will be necessary to devote more time to them as no craft can be mastered without a great deal of practice and a craftsman’s hands cannot become experienced without a full amount of work. Proficiency in a craft cannot be developed in the same manner as a mental activity. After reading a little, the mind can develop without further reading as it can continue to think while being engaged in any other activity. Being a purely physical activity, a craft can be developed only while it is being practised; hence it requires complete familiarization with it. Moreover, the middle classes are not in the habit of practising any craft; hence, in order to form that habit, they require specially to cultivate familiarity with it.
 Another point in the speech which attracts our attention is the reference to the dictionary which is getting ready. The present chaotic state of spellings acts as a hindrance to the development of the language. Kakasaheb hopes that this dictionary will be ready  by March. If this task is accomplished, an important piece of work as yet unaccomplished will have been completed. Amongst all the languages of India, Gujarati is found to be the only one in which laxity in regard to spellings is possible.
 A new experiment which has been referred to in the speech is that of developing fellow-feeling towards one’s servants. If we cannot do without servants, the alternative is to establish cordial relations with them by putting them on the same footing with ourselves. Kakasaheb hopes to establish such relations by running a class for servants. His good intentions will be fulfilled if the students carry out this task in an
 honest manner.
 Despite these new activities, knowledge of the alphabet has not been neglected. Anyone who goes through the speech will clearly see that sufficient attention is also being paid to this aspect. In other Words, a careful attempt is being made to put before the students who are being trained by the Vidyapith all that is required to turn them into village workers. Whether they will be receptive to this or not will depend on their enthusiasm. This latter factor in its turn is dependent upon the art of the teacher.

190,,THE FAIR AT WAUTHA,"
    
 This fair is held every year in Wautha on the full-moon day in the month of Kartik. Following is the notice which has been issued with regard to it by Shri Dahyabhai Patel on behalf of the taluk committee:libtech_205_footnote
 This appeal involves a request for two things: one is for volunteers and the other for funds. I am confident that assistance of both sorts will be forthcoming. While sending in this appeal, Shri Dahyabhai writes that he has received a sum of Rs. 300 from the pro- vincial committee. The other contribution that has so  far been received amounts to only Rs. 31. The minimum expense amounts to Rs. 500. Hence I hope that the balance will be readily forthcoming. I consider it remarkable that the public can be served through the expenditure of such a small sum. I have found that volunteer bodies incur large expenses on such occasions.
 It is not always the case that people enjoy only innocent pleasures at such fairs. Dahyabhai has described the ideal. It is the task of the volunteers in such fairs to see that purity is maintained. It is often found that at fairs
l.	limits of decency are  transgressed,
 gambling 	 is practised, there 	is fighting, wicked 	persons resort to ill-practices, and  many 	inedible things are 	eaten and 	things which should not 	be sold 	are sold. 
 
 It is impossible to stop these practices at once in a crowd of thousands. However, reforms can be brought about by making an attempt on every occasion. On such occasions, dealers of foreign cloth sell large stocks of foreign cloth too. Propaganda for khadi can well be carried on instead. If all this is to be achieved, preparations should be made in advance, and there should be a large number of good, intelligent and self sacrificing volunteers. If these steps are taken, such fairs can be well utilized for educating the public.

 I
A correspondent writes:
 I have read your article “The Fiery Ordeal”libtech_207_footnoteover and over again but it has failed to satisfy me. Your proposal about the killing of monkeys has taken me aback. I believed that a person like you with his being steeped in ahimsa would never swerve from the right path even though the heavens fell. And now you say that you might kill off the monkeys to protect your Ashram against their inroads. Maybe that my first impression about you was wrong. But I cannot describe what a shock your proposal about the killing of the monkeys has given me, and may I also confess, how angry it has made me feel against you? Would you kindly help me out of my perplexity?
 I have received several other letters too in the same strain. I am afraid people have formed an altogether exaggerated estimate of me. These good people seem to think that because I am trying to analyse and define the ideal of ahimsa I must have fully attained that ideal. My views regarding the calf and the monkeys seem happily to have shattered this illusion of theirs. Truth to me is infinitely dearer than the ‘mahatmaship’ which is purely a burden. It is my knowledge of my limitations and my nothingness which has so far saved me from the oppressiveness of the ‘mahatmaship’. I am painfully aware of the fact that my desire to continue life in the body involves me in constant himsa, that is why I am becoming growingly indifferent to this physical body of mine. For instance I know that in the act of respi- ration I destroy innumerable invisible germs floating in the air. But I do not stop breathing. The consumption of vegetables involves himsa
 
 but I find that I cannot give them up. Again, there is himsa in the use of antiseptics, yet I cannot bring myself to discard the use of disinfec- tants like kerosene, etc., to rid myself of the mosquito pest and the like. I suffer snakes to be killed in the Ashram when it is impossible to catch and put them out of harm’s way. I even tolerate the use of the stick to drive the bullocks in the Ashram Thus there is no end of himsa which I directly and indirectly commit. And now I find myself confronted with this monkey problem. Let me assure the reader that I am in no hurry to take the extreme step of killing them. In fact I am not sure that I would at all be able finally to make up my mind to kill them. As it is, friends are helping me with useful suggestions and the adoption of some of them may solve the difficulty at least temporarily without our having to kill them. But I cannot today promise that I shall never kill the monkeys even though they may destroy all the crop in the Ashram. If as a result of this humble confession of mine, friends choose to give me up as lost, I would be sorry but nothing will induce me to try to conceal my imperfections in the practice  of  ahimsa. AlI claim for myself is that I am ceaselessly trying to understand the implications of great ideals like ahimsa and to practise them in thought, word and deed and that not without  a  certain measure of success as I think. But It know that I have a long distance yet to cover in this direction. Unless therefore the correspondent in question can bring himself to bear with my imperfections I am sorry I can offer him but little consolation.
 II
Another correspondent writes:
 Supposing my elder brother is suffering  from  a  terrible  and  pain- ful, malady and doctors have despaired of his life and I too feel likewise, should I in the circumstances put him out of life?
 My reply is in the negative. I am afraid some of my correspondents have not even taken the trouble to understand my article. In propounding their conundrums they forget that whilst I have certainly compared the case of an ailing human being with that of an ailing calf and recommended the killing of the former in exa- ctly similar circumstances, in actual practice such a complete analogy is hardly ever to be found. In the first place the human body being much more manageable in bulk is always easier to manipulate and nurse; secondly man being gifted with the power of speech more often than not is in a position to express his wishes and so the question of taking his life without his consent cannot come within the rule. For  I have never suggested that the life of another person can be taken against his will without violating the principle of ahimsa. Again, we do
 not always despair of the life of a person when he is reduced to a comatose state and even when he is past all hope he is not necessarily past all help. More often than not it is both possible and practicable to render service to a human patient till the very end. Whilst, therefore, I would still maintain that the principle enunciated regarding the calf applies equally to man and bird and beast I should expect an  intelligent person to know the obvious natural difference between a man and an animal. To recapitulate the conditions the fulfilment of all of which alone can warrant the taking of life from the point of view of ahimsa:
 l. The disease from which the patient is suffering should be incurable.
 All 	concerned have despaired 	of the 	life of 	the patient. The 	case should be 	beyond all 	help or service.  It 	should be 	impossible for 	the patient in 	question to 	express his 	or its wish. 
 So long as even one of these conditions remains unfulfilled the taking of life from the point of view of ahimsa cannot be justified.
 III
A third correspondent writes:
 Well, the killing of the calf is all right so far as it goes. But have you considered that your example is likely to afford a handle to those who indulge in animal sacrifices and thus accentuate the practice; do you not know that even those who commit these deeds argue that the animals sacrificed gain merit in the life to follow?
 Such abuse of my action is quite possible, and inevitable so long as there are hypocrisy and ignorance in this world. What crimes have not been committed in the world in the sacred name of religion? One therefore need not be deterred from doing what one considers to be right merely because one’s  conduct may be misunderstood or misinterpreted by others. And as for those who practise animal sacrifice, surely they do not need the authority of my example to defend their conduct since they profess to take their stand on the authority of the Shastras. My fear however is that proceeding on my analogy some people might actually take into their head summarily to put to death those whom they might imagine to be their enemies on the plea that it would serve both the interests of society and the ‘enemies’ concerned, if the latter were killed. In fact I have often heard people advance this argument. But it is enough for my purpose to know that my interpretation of ahimsa affords no basis whatever for such an argument, for in the latter case there is no question of serving
 
 or anticipating the wishes of the victims concerned. Finally, even if it were admitted that it was in the interest of the animal or the enemy in question to be summarily dispatched the act would still be spelt as himsa because it would not be altogether disinterested. The fallacy is so obvious. But who can help people who seeing see not, or are bent upon deceiving themselves?

192,,THE STUDENTS’ INTERROGATORIESlibtech_208_footnote,"
    
 (Before Gandhiji commenced reading Hind Swaraj with the students of the Gujarat Vidyapith they had addressed him a string of questions for answer. As some of these questions are of general interest Gandhiji had dealt with them in the columns of
 Navajivanlibtech_209_footnotelibtech_210_footnote. The following assortment out of them will be found useful by the readers
 of Young India .P.)
 UNDER SWARAJ
 Q. What in your opinion ought to be the basis of India’s future economic constitution? What place will such institutions as savings banks, insurance companies, etc., have in it?
 A. According to me the economic constitution of India and for the matter of that the world should be such that no one under it should suffer from want of food and clothing. In other words, every- body should be able to get sufficient work to enable him to make the two ends meet. And this ideal can be universally realized only if the means of production of elementary necessaries of life remain in the control of the masses. These should be freely available to all as God’s air and water are or ought to be; they should not be made a vehicle of traffic for the exploitation of others. Their monopolization by any country, nation or groups of persons would be unjust. The neglect of this simple principle is the cause of the destitution that we witness today not only in this unhappy land but other parts of the world too.  It is this evil that the khadi movement is calculated to remedy. Savings banks and insurance companies will be there even when the economic reforms suggested by me. have been effected but their nature will have undergone a complete transformation. Savings banks today in India though a useful institution do not serve the very poorest. As for our insurance companies they are of no use whatever to the poor. What part they can play in an ideal scheme of reconstruction such as I have postulated is more than I can say. The function of savings banks
 
 ought to be to enable the poorest to husband their  hard-earned  savings and to subserve the interests of the country generally. Though  I have lost faith in most Government institutions, as I have said before, savings banks are good so far as they go but unfortunately today their services are available only to the urban section of the community and so long as our gold reserves are located outside India they can hardly be regarded as trustworthy institutions. In the event of a war all these banks may become not only utterly useless but even a curse to the people inasmuch as the Government will not scruple to employ the funds held by these banks against the depositors themselves. No Government institution can be depended upon to remain loyal to the interests of the people in emergency, if they are not controlled by and not run in the interests of the people. So long therefore  as  this  primary condition is absent banks are in the last resort additional links to keep the people in chains. They may be regarded as an unvoidable evil and therefore to be suffered to exist but it is well to understand where we are in respect even of such harm. less looking institutions.
 FOREIGN v. SWADESHI
 
 Q. What is your opinion about the importation of foreign goods other than cloth into India? Are there any foreign commodities which you would like to see immediately laid under prohibition? What do you think should be the nature of India’s foreign trade in the future?
 A. I am more or less indifferent with regard to trade in foreign goods other than cloth. I have never been an advocate of prohibition of all things foreign because they are foreign. My economic creed is a complete taboo in respect of all foreign commodities, whose impor- tation is likely to prove harmful to our indigenous interests. This means that we may not in any circumstance import a commodity that can be adequately supplied from our own country. For instance I would regard it a sin to import Australian wheat on the score of its better quality but I would not have the slightest hesitation in importing oatmeal from Scotland, if an absolute necessity for it is made out, because we do not grow oats in India. In other words I would not countenance the boycott of a single foreign article out of ill-will or a feeling of hatred. Or to take up a reverse case, India produces a sufficient quantity of leather; it is my duty therefore to wear shoes made out of Indian leather only, even if it is comparatively dearer and of an inferior quality, in preference to cheaper and superior quality foreign leather shoes. Similarly I would condemn the introduction of foreign molasses or sugar if enough of it is produced in India for our needs. It will be thus clear from the above that it is hardly possible for me to give an exhaustive catalogue of foreign articles whose impor-
 
 tation in India ought to be prohibited. I have simply inculcated the general principle by which we can be guided in a]l such cases. And this principle will hold good in future too so long as the conditions of production in our country remain as they are today.

193,"October 28, 1928","SPEECH AT THE NEW GUJARATI SCHOOL, AHMEDABAD","
    
 October 28, 1928
 This school owes its existence to Shri Indulal Yajnik, and we would be failing in our duty and be deemed ungrateful if we did not remember him while mentioning it. We cannot forget his major contribution towards creating an interest in Gujarat and its (the school’s) activities. This school is the result of his endeavours. The teachers have carried on its work; they need to be congratulated on this. The principal of the school has made a reference to its connection with the Vidyapith. The school has nothing to do with the organizing committee of the Vidyapith. It is my sad experience, however, thatVidyapith and such other institutions do not function well if we do not narrow down the field of their activities, and the present limited scope of the Vidyapith is to ensure its progress and not retard it. I assure you that not the slightest injury will be done to those schools which render service to the nation. The Vidyapith exists in order to foster the educational activities which are being carried on in Gujarat. Its present endeavours are to make all schools self-reliant and to rid them of sluggishness and inertia. So far as this school is concerned, there is no such apprehension; otherwise, I would not have come at all today. I expect much from the students and teachers of this school.
 You have enacted a very good play dealing with  sacrifice.  Luther sacrificed himself for freedom’s sake. Similarly, there is a need to risk death for the sake of the national schools, regardless of whether one meets with death or not. We are brave at the outset, but are always ready to abandon our pledge because we lack faith in our work. So long as we lack such faith, we shall be unable to make India’s prestige enduring as we want to do.
 The Goddess of Independence is like an angel of death. She sits with her mouth open, inviting everyone to enter it. If we are not prepared for this, we shall be unable to fulfil our cherished desires. It is good for you to play, jump and make your bodies and minds healthy, but do not forget the basic difference between national and
 governmental schools. The education given at the latter may be good, but one thing these will not give you. Even today I proclaim loudly that those schools are fit to be abandoned by us. You should be determined to offer at the feet of Mother [India] whatever art and physical prowess you acquire in this school. Patriotism should be so taught here that every student should decide that, when he grows up, he will serve the country. If you do so while adhering to truth and ahimsa, it will include service to the family as well. I bless the children and request the teachers to put fully into practice the ideals they have accepted. So long as they do not do this, the children will be unable to respond to them.

 CHI. SHANTIKUMAR,
 I have your letter. I was disappointed with the draft for an organization to promote swadeshi. I smelt in it merely a commercial spirit. From one point of view, however, what is happening is good. The draft shows the mill-owners as they are, and what can be better than that we should seem what we are?
 I should certainly like you to keep yourselves away from this move, if you can. I am surprised to know that Shri Jaisukhlal is associating himself with it. You may, if you wish, show this letter to him and to anyone else who is likely to appreciate my views.

  	I have your two letters at the same time, one about the Ashram and 	one describing your Meerut visit I sent you two letters to the     
 Muzaffarpur address, one on Sunday and the other on Monday.
 I don’t know how the news about the Ashram appears in the papers. Anyway most of it is all false. If there was any violent change  I would have surely written to you. I have not dealt with even the change of name in the paper because Mahadev and others  were anxious that I should not even announce change of name in the Press. Now, of course, I shall be obliged to do so. But the committee of the Udyoga Mandir would not relax the rule about brahmacharya, so that the fundamental rule about brahmacharya and all fundamental rules remain as they were. So does the common kitchen remain a fixture irrevocably for at least one year. At the end of the year only, it is now possible to reconsider the question of the common kitchen in the light of the experience that will be gained. The kitchen is going on merrily.
 The Gandhi Ashram people in Meerut want carding demonstr- ation and demonstration of other processes at the time of a fair that is to be held on 21st November. If you are not going to Nepal, it might be well to retrace your steps and go to this fair and give them what help you can and then proceed to Kashmir. Apart from everything else, I would like you to visit Kashmir and that you will do only while there is some khadi work going on. And you can take the help of Devdas, Rasik and Navin for arranging the demonstration, in which case it won’t be necessary to send anybody from here, and as we are terribly short-handed at the present moment, it will be very inconvenient to send any from the Ashram. Yet I am anxious to help the Meerut people. Having known my views, you will do what suits you best. I have not held out any hope to Muzmudar who is the one to write the letter.

 ‘FREEDOM TO THE FREE’
 Whilst we are cutting one another’s throats in the name of reli-gion and some of us running to the Statutory Commissionlibtech_223_footnotelibtech_224_footnotein the vain hope of getting freedom, a friend sends me the following from James Allen to remind us that even in the land of so-called freedom, the real freedom has still to come. Here is the passage:
 All outward oppression is but the shadow and effect of the real oppression within. For ages the oppressed have cried for liberty, and a thousand man-made statutes have failed to give it to them. They can give it only to themselves; they shall find it only in obedience to the Divine Statutes which are inscribed upon their hearts. Let them resort to the inward freedom, and the shadow of oppression shall no more darken the earth. Let men cease to oppress themselves, and no man shall oppress his brother. Men legislate for an outward freedom, yet continue to render such freedom impossible of achievement by fostering an inward condition of enslavement. They thus pursue a shadow without, and ignore the substance within. All outward forms of bondage and oppression will cease to be when man ceases to be the willing bond-slave of passion, error, and ignorance.
 The outward freedom therefore that we shall attain will only be in exact proportion to the inward freedom to which we may have grown at a given moment. And if this is the correct view of free- dom, our chief energy must be concentrated upon achieving reform from within. In this much-needed work all who will can take an equal share. We need neither to be lawyers, nor legislators to be able to take part in the great effort. When this reform takes place on a national scale no outside power can stop our onward march.

 "
208,,IN TEN YEARS?,"
    
 Professor C. N. Vakil’s instructive articles publishedlibtech_225_footnotelibtech_226_footnotein these pages are supplementary to the series he recently wrote on povertylibtech_227_footnoteand should be read together. I coaxed him to give the reader some- thing more definite on remedies of poverty than what he had done in the article which I ventured to withhold and which he expanded into the four articles above referred to. I do not think that the programme sketched by the learned Professor can be finished in  ten  years. Perhaps it is impossible to devise a ten years’ programme of improve- ment to cover a vast and impoverished country like ours.
 Let us however glance at Professor Vakil’s remedies for India’s central disease. He rightly says that the problem is how to increase production of wealth and how to distribute it equitably among the people, principally therefore, I presume, among the starving millions. To this end the learned writer
 would 	recast small uneconomic holdings,  would 	pay off the debts 	of the 	ryot through 	mortgage and 	co-operative banks,  would 	revise the 	revenue law 	and graduate the 	land tax so as to bring 	it in a 	line with the 	income tax 	leaving a 	minimum of 	income from land free of tax,  would 	re-employ the 	population displaced 	through the 	recasting of 	uneconomic holdings 	by bringing under the 	plough cultivable waste, 	i.e., 23 per 	cent of the 	total area 	available and 	by nationalizing 	and thus 	developing large industries,  would 	draw small and large capital 	by putting 	the banking 	system on 	a basis more 	in keeping 	with the requirements 	 of the 	country than it is now,  would 	improve labour 	conditions so 	as to avoid war 	between capital and labour,  would 	deal with such social abuses as 	child-marriages, etc., 	which give rise to 	over-population and 	unfit progeny,  would 	radically reform 	the educational 	system so as to spread education among the masses and have it answer the needs of 
 
 
 the people,
  and 	would cut down  the  	military  expenditure 	 and  stop  the 	drain from the 	country by 	manning the 	services with 	indigenous talent. 
 This is not an unattractive programme. But as I was re-reading the articles, the question continued to force itself upon me, “Who will bell the cat?” There is hardly an item here which can be tackled without government aid. And a government that is admittedly based on exploitation of the governed will not and cannot, even if it will, undertake the proposed changes with the despatch necessary to create an immediate impression. It can undertake irrigation schemes costing crores, it will not undertake sinking wells costing lakhs. What therefore Professor Vakil wants first is a summary programme of swaraj and having been chiefly instrumental in getting it, he can command the appointment of commissioner of banishment of poverty department.
 This however is a heroic remedy and Pandit Motilal Nehru and the co-signatories to his report are the men to tackle it. Our author’s [task] was but to place a scheme before any government that would deal with the most pressing problem before the country.
 But I had hoped that the learned Professor, especially when he wrote for Young India, would have examined the one  sovereign remedy that has in season and out of season been advocated through these pages and has, so far as it has gone, been tried with no inconsiderable success. True, the Professor has hidden the tiny wheel in a little unseen arc of his circle of suggestions. I claim for it not a point in a circumference but the centre from which can radiate innumerable other things including many the learned writer has in view. But the fact is, whereas it was possible for him with patient research carried on in a well-stocked library to write convincing essays to prove India’s deep and deepening poverty, it was impossible  without a close study of a group of villages with an open and receptive mind to spot the seat of the disease and to know the capacity of the patient to bear the remedy. A Gregglibtech_228_footnotelibtech_229_footnotetook  a   year  of  reading  and living among the villagers to know the remedy and prove its worth with a freshness of outlook all his own. The cardinal facts to realize are that there is already terrible, forced unemployment among the toiling millions in that they have no work for at least four months in the year. Once that is realized, surely it follows that not a moment should be lost in bringing work to these millions so as to utilize their
 
 idle hours. The other fact to realize is that if the average income of the inhabitant of this land is seven pice per day, i.e., less than two English pennies per day, at the present rate of exchange, the average income of the toiling millions must ipso facto be much less. He who adds two pice per day to their income and that without any great capital outlay makes a princely addition to their income and in addition revives the dying hope within the breasts of these millions. The further merit of this programme is that it is now in operation without government aid. But it needs much greater encouragement and admits of infinite expansion. Pyarelal has shownlibtech_230_footnoteelsewhere in this issue of Young India what America wrought through the wheel during those times of her Revolution. I invite the economists of India to study the movement on the spot. They have nearly two thousand villages to select from for their study and let them then condemn the movement if they can, or give it not a niggardly place that prudence or patronage can grud- gingly afford but the central place it deserves.

Guarded I should never have to be in writing to friends like 	you. But my letter was certainly concise and necessarily so.  	Now for the purport of the conversation. Whilst your offer to 	Panditji and repeated in your letter flatters my pride, I would not 	like you, an esteemed co-worker, to give up your views or principles 	in order to please me. Such things can only be done once in a 	lifetime, and even when such personal concessions are accepted, they 	harm the     
 acceptor, harm the giver and damage the national cause in question. And let me put you absolutely at ease by telling you that I have before Panditji undertaken, all being well, to attend the Congress unconditionally.
 I am sorry I cannot say so with reference to the representation of the All-India Spinners’ Association at the Exhibition. My argu- ment is this: whilst it is  wrong  to  think  that  I  dislike  all  machi- nery as such, I do feel that we are not competent judges of the use- fulness  or  otherwise  of machinery  however  small  it  may  be  for the  toiling  millions.  We  shall  acquire   that   faculty   for   judg- ment when we draw to the Congress stout-hearted and  knowing farmers and other business  men.  Let  me  tell  you  that  in  the Ashram we have a variety of simple machinery in the way of ploughs, grass-cutting machines, grinding-mills, etc. But I am sorry to have to inform you that not much of our investment in this line has proved profitable or promising. This has happened because we  are  all amateur farmers. And this is a judgment which I give you after an experience extending over a period of 13 years. Therefore I would say, if you have got the courage, you will scrap every bit of machinery for the time being, especially foreign, and you will concentrate your energy upon having your Exhibition with khaddar as the centre-piece and a small but a sufficient number of genuine swadeshi articles of a useful nature.
 I have an irreconcilable opposition to the Indian textiles being exhibited in any shape or form. My reason is absolutely simple. The textile manufacturers refuse to come to terms with us. I do not blame them because if they come to terms with us, they have to sacrifice all prospects of Government assistance save what is forced from it by an active public opinion. Moreover these textiles need no advertisement from us. They have got an army of advertisers, inspectors, selling agents and what not. And, lastly, to put mill textiles side by side with khadi is deliberately to put khadi in the shade by inviting undesirable comparisons.
 I remind you that the very first exhibition of this type was undertaken at the Ahmedabad Congress in 1921.libtech_236_footnoteIt drew huge audi- ences. The entrance fee, a paltry sum, left a good surplus. Wherever there is good and efficient management of exhibitions of an educative character, they are not only useful and instructive but they are remunerative. Such was the case in Bihar. One indispensable condition of Congress Exhibitions should be that we should never undertake them for finding our expenses and leaving besides a handsome sum
 
 for conducting the business of the year to come. Unfortunately this very undesirable thing was done in Madras exposing us to an evil temptation. I wish that Bengal which has abundant patriotism, self-sacrifice and fine sentiment will rise superior to such temptations.
 If this letter seems to you to be lacking in detail, do write to me again. Let there be no mistake about it. I want to take part in the Ex- hibition. But I can only take part in it consistently with the national interest as I understand it. But I have said to myself that if I cannot take part in the Exhibition, I am not going to say one  word  of criticism either during the Exhibition or after. I did not feel called upon to impose any such silence on myself in Madras, because the circumstances were different and so I expressed my views freely at the time of opening the Exhibitionlibtech_237_footnoteand still more freely  in  a  leading articlelibtech_238_footnotelibtech_239_footnotein Young India after opening it.
 I have a string of letters asking me to give my views freely and now about the forthcoming Exhibition. I have hitherto resisted all these correspondents as I hope to, to the end. I therefore plead with you not to be deterred from your purpose which you may hold to be based on an inviolable principle in the interest of the nation. I assure you that I shall tender the same respect for your principles as I would crave from you and all for mine, however erring they may appear to others.
 With reference to the Hospitallibtech_240_footnote, I am glad it is flourishing. I shall certainly perform the opening ceremony of the new ward, and so far as possible make time for it.

 I have your letter enclosing extracts from the Indian Textile Journal. I have read Sjt. Talcharkar’s work very carefully. Not being convinced of his argument, I entered into correspondence with him. He is still unable to convince me that charkha yarn is on the whole stronger than mill yarn. In the Ashram we made series of experiments and they went to show that in order to produce hand-spun yarn superior to the mill-spun, we have to take extraordinary precaution which an ordinary spinner has no facility of taking. Sjt. Talcharkar’s is a theoretical proposition, appearing sound to read but failing in practice. You can well understand how anxious I should be to know and prove that the average charkha yarn is stronger than the average mill-spun yarn.

Courtesy: Valji G. Desai         	Just a few days before Deshbandhu’s death, while replying to an 	address of welcome given by the business community of Jalpaiguri, I      
 had said that we had lost India through our merchants and we should regain it also through them. This is not the task of a lawyer, a doctor or a soldier. Many Englishmen proudly say that they took India with the help of the sword and are holding it with the strength of the sword, but there is less than fifty per cent of truth in this statement. If the merchants so desire, they can blunt the edge of that sword. If illustrations of the truth of this statement were wanted, a striking one is furnished by the following circular letter from one mercantile association to another:libtech_250_footnote
 It is characteristic of the British people that they give up their hold on the country from which they can obtain no wealth. They did so in the case of the Transvaal in the year 1884, and when they saw wealth there they launched a war in 1900 in order to gain possession of it. They gave up Somaliland when they could not make money there. They do not want a country for the sake of possessing it but for the sake of carrying on trade with it. That is why Napoleon criticized them and called them “a nation of shopkeepers”.
 British rule, therefore, does not subsist on might, but it would be more correct to say that it functions with the help of our merchants. If our merchants give up the temptation to trade with Britain in cloth, or if the people give up wearing foreign cloth, the British would have no reason to hold on to India.
 But is the spirit of sacrifice present in the merchant community? It is found that a man makes many sacrifices, but is seldom prepared to sacrifice that from which he earns money. Merchants are  well  known for their generosity. But when they are asked to give up their business, they feel aggrieved. Lawyers will be ready to donate thousands of rupees, but there would be few men like Das, who would be ready to give up their legal practice. Doctors will donate large sums but only a few would be prepared to give up their profession.
 Despite this, if we want real independence, merchants would have to give up their business and be prepared to serve the country. Such sacrifice will be regarded as their  prayaschittalibtech_251_footnotelibtech_252_footnote. If it is true, and indeed it is, that we lost India because of their greed, then we will get back India only through their sacrifice.
 But the sacrifice that I expect from merchants is in fact very small. All I ask for is a change in their business, and not its ruin. I ask for their trade to be carried on within limits. In spite of the boycott of foreign cloth, the business in khadi amounting to crores of rupees
 
 would be carried on by business men alone. Without these latter, people would be unable to carry on transactions. The term business implies transactions. Anyone who is good at social intercourse, is a good business man. A merchant is one who enables people  to  establish contacts with one another.
 Today, the ability of the business man is being misused. He earns five per cent while giving away ninety-five to the foreigners. I ask him to put his abilities to good use. He should give ninety-five to the people and keep five for himself. By doing so, he will get his share of five per cent and his earnings will be regarded as pure. The crores that he makes today is tainted money. It is possible that under the new order the crores that fall to the share of a few today may  be distributed amongst hundreds of business men. However this should not be regarded as a matter of regret. Everyone will agree that it would be a better scheme if many have a lakh or a thousand instead of a few having crores. And it is my firm opinion that if business men do not understand these simple and commonplace calculations it would be almost impossible to prevent anarchy, plunder and revolution in India. The poisonous wind of anarchy blowing from the West cannot be kept out by, any other means.

224,,THE ASSAULT ON LALAJI,"
    
 This country is poor, there is trouble within it and repression from without, there seems to be deep darkness all round and yet it appears to be fortunate. The symbol of this good fortune is the assault on Lalaji by the police in Lahore. Lalaji was not at fault. The procession which he was leading also was not at fault. Lalaji had full control over the procession, hence the fault or whatever it was of the procession or of Lalaji consisted in the decision they had made. That decision was to offer peaceful opposition to the Simon Commission when it arrived. In order to demonstrate this opposition, the pro- cession was going up to the barrier set up by the police. It  had  reached the barrier and was uttering deafening cries of “Simon, go back”. Besides Lalaji, this procession included other leaders such as Lala Hansraj, Dr. Alam and others.
 As this demonstration and the people’s determination irritated the police, they decided to teach Lalaji a lesson and assaulted him. The police deserved no credit that the assault did not assume grave proportions. How easy was it for the injury to be inflicted on the eye
 instead of near it? To fate alone, and not the police, can be given the credit for the injury to the chest being of a relatively light nature instead of a serious one! According to newspaper reports, the police spared no pains to demonstrate their skill in wielding the lathi.
 Lalaji has emphatically stated that the statement made by the police in their own defence is absolutely untrue. The police claim that the procession rushed into the small space that had been left vacant for a passage and that it resorted to stone-throwing. Lalaji denies both these charges and affirms that the police may file a libel suit against him if they wish to do so. He is prepared to prove his own case.
 Let us now see if the police are prepared to take up  this challenge.
 The attention of the public and that of the world is attracted only when warrior leaders such as Lalaji are injured; the assault on Lalaji has drawn and will yet draw a great deal more attention than would have been drawn by the death of an unimportant individual.
 We shall have to be careful and see to it that the people by resorting to violence do not lose the game in which victory is within their grasp. If the atrocities of the Government continue despite the innocence of the people, the ship of the Government will sink of its own accord. Hence I hope that the people will not transgress the limits at any place and fully respect all the appeals for maintaining peace that are made by the leaders.
 I congratulate Lalaji. He has been well known for many years as the “Lion of the Punjab”. The Government’s police have themselves helped on this occasion to add to his prestige and the above assault is an addition to the many services he has rendered to the country.
 The following telegramlibtech_253_footnotehas been received from Lalaji after the above article was written:

225,,MY NOTES,"
    
 TRUE INDEPENDENCE
 At a time when we are cutting one another’s throats in the name of religion and are competing with one another in running to the Simon Commission, and so on, in the hope of securing independence, it is worth noting what the British writer James Allen says about
 
 independence in England. A friend has sent an extract from his article the sum and substance of which is as follows:
 As a matter of fact, all acts of repression from without are nothing but a reflection of the atrocities that are perpetrated within. Although for thousands of years men have been craving for freedom, the thousands of laws made by him have been unable to win it for him. The truth of the matter is that freedom alone can bestow freedom. That freedom consists in following the immutable laws framed by God which have been inscribed on our hearts. No one can harm him who has attained the freedom of his soul. If people cease to be cruel to themselves, they will be unable to be cruel towards others. People frame laws for their external freedom, whereas they worship slavery in their hearts. Thus, they run after an external shadow and ignore the real thing within their souls. Man’s bondage in all forms and all his atrocities will be automatically eradicated when he frees himself from slavery to his passions, his ignorance and his shortcomings.
 This implies that external freedom will always be the means of measuring the freedom of the self within. Hence we often find that laws made to grant us freedom often turn out to be shackles binding us. Hence the dharma of those workers who wish to  attain  true freedom is to try and attempt an improvement in the self. If we understand this simple and straightforward fact, we shall not even utter the word ‘legislature’ but engage ourselves in constructive activity day and night. All can take part in such activity. It is not necessary to become either a lawyer or a legislator in order to do so. What strange blindness it is that those who are elected as legislators to represent the people should seem, and in fact are, their rulers! If we are not under an illusion, we would have no fear of the Government or the legislatures, lawcourts or the armies which subsist on it. And no power can come in the way of our upliftment and our independence when we have reformed ourselves in the above manner.

226,,BUFFALOES FOR SLAUGHTER,"
    
 Shri Nagindas Amulakhrai, Vice-president of the Sarvajanik Jivadaya Khatun, Ghatkopar, writes as follows:libtech_254_footnote
 I have gone through the letters which have been mentioned in the above letter. The reader will feel; as I do, that the municipality is slaughtering buffaloes for the sake of slaughter. The killing of buffaloes whose meat is not eaten by anyone is merely a chaotic state of affairs and it is a matter for surprise that citizens of  Bombay tolerate it. This is not a problem which concerns the Hindus alone, but one which concerns all citizens—Muslims, Parsis, Christians and Jews alike. Moreover, it is not one which involves the  Department  of Animal Welfare alone, but one which involves public welfare and the health of children. On the one hand, the country is becoming increasi- ngly poorer; on the other hand it is being robbed of its cattle-wealth because of the indifference of citizens as for example in Bombay. To slaughter milk yielding cows and buffaloes or to allow their calves to die of hunger and thirst is nothing but robbery and the cause of this robbery is the insignificant income that the municipality derives from it! According to the calculation made by Shri Nagindas, a minimum loss of rupees two crores and twenty lakhs is suffered because of this thoughtless slaughter. And finally, in a country which would have the facility to provide milk in the same way as it provides water, we have to drink imported milk which contains no food value. It is a matter of no small shame for us to have to consume imported milk and to have vegetable oil sold as ghee, because of shortage of fresh milk. In Bombay and other cities, there is a lot of useless clamour, but apart from societies for animal welfare, no one else thinks of raising a protest and launching an effective movement in such an extremely important matter.
 As has been suggested in the above letter, the cure for this malady is simple and straightforward. Not a single cow or buffalo will be taken to the slaughter-house if the pens are removed from the city and if the municipality undertakes to supply milk specially  to Bombay, whatever the expense it might have to incur in doing so. Is it not a matter for surprise that the farmers of Bardoli welcome the buffaloes which are regarded as useless in Bombay and hope to make
 
 a profit out of them? What is possible in Bardoli should not be impossible in Bombay.

 "
227,,THE ALCHEMY OF THOUGHT,"
    
 The well-known writer, Professor Jacks, has written a book whose title may be interpreted as Alchemy of Thought. Pyarelal has written an article based on this book in the current issue of Young India which deserves to be pondered over. Hence this article, which itself is based on the one just mentioned, has been published for the convenience of Gujarati readers.
 The alchemy of thought implies that the latter acts as an alchemist. No one can tell whether any alchemist has been able to transmute iron into gold, but thought continuously performs this fun- ction. By entertaining a particular thought, man becomes the victim of fear and turns pale; by entertaining its opposite thought, his counte- nance becomes flushed with pleasure. I shall feel sad if I think, ‘I am having a spasm of pain, all will be over with me now.’ However, if I ignore the spasm and say to myself, ‘What is there in a spasm after all, it will pass away presently’ I shall continue to be cheerful. Perhaps a stranger from abroad comes to my house and I suspect him. I assume that he is a murderer and am terribly scared. My son comes and tells me: ‘This gentleman is an old family friend, we do not know him as he has been living abroad since his childhood. He is a guest in our house today and has come here to convey some good news.’ On hearing this, I regain my composure. Now I embrace with respect one whom I had feared before. All this is the alchemy of thought. Within a fraction of a second, thought can make a king or pauper of us. Such is the empire of thought. Thought is infinitely more powerful than either speech or the bodily processes. Physical activity is the coarsest form that thought assumes, while speech is one of its coarser forms. Both these activities limit thought. It is indeed proper that it should be so. If this were not the case, the world would surely be destroyed. However, this is to prove the power of thought. Hence it may be said that, when devoid of thought, speech or action is something  mechanical and it has no value.
 Following this line of argument, Professor Jacks goes on to say that a great and all-pervading element like religion is not a game whose rules are laid down in books, it is not a treasure chest which contains affirmations and negations, it is not a collection of
 prohibitions. Anyone who wishes to do his dharma, to practise non-violence and to follow the dictates of morality has to walk on the razor’s edge. For him there are no lectures on non-violence nor any dictionary of spellings which would enable him to obtain a hundred per cent marks in the test on non-violence. Observing one’s dharma is not such a safe thing. It is a gem that lies buried in the mine of experience. Only a few among millions of seekers succeed in digging it out. Mr. Jacks says that dharma is not for those who ask for a guarantee of safety. The field of religion lies between doubt and certainty. One who believes or asserts that this indeed is religion or that this alone is religion does not know what religion is. One who wants to know the meaning of dharma, while admitting that  a particular action may or may not be according to dharma surrenders to his inner voice and continues to conduct himself with determination and calmness. Not being omniscient himself, on the one hand he is determined and, on the other hand, he humbly allows for  the possibility that he may be making a mistake.
This learned gentleman goes on to say:
 Just as we can repeatedly affirm in arithmetic that two and two make four, similarly, in the science of morality, we cannot affirm with conviction that this alone is our duty. The deeper meaning behind dharma or non-violence does not lie in results which can be proved; their mystery is revealed in going beyond such proofs and by taking certain risks where such proofs are impossible.
 In our language this is known as faith. Dharma is something that is based on faith. Faith constitutes proof for that which cannot be proved by the five senses. Hence it is only by respectfully honouring the dictates of our inner voice that we may hope to have direct perception of dharma at some time in the future. Hence Mr. Jacks says:
 A man who becomes ready to listen to his own inner voice only after subjecting it to a test may be said to have abandoned it and he has failed to recognize the spiritual powers that are within him. Finally, he reaches a state which is so devoid of morality that it may be said of him that he has no such thing as an inner voice.
 Therefore, what should man do when he comes across misery or oppression ? The author says:
 For me there are only two alternatives, either to  experiment or to do nothing. Hence it becomes my dharma to carry out experiments after studying the situation as much as
 possible. However, there is the danger that I may have made an error in my calculations. Even if on the day of judgment, I am told that my experiments are wrong, I shall lay down my life in order to complete them. I shall face the risk of there being a possibility of error in certain experiments in order to prove the truth of that which appears to be true to me.
 This writer is of the opinion—and we too find—that many truths have been discovered through experiments in which such risks of mistakes were incurred, for such errors arise from pure motives and devotion to truth and mistakes that have been unintentionally made are forgotten in course of time.
 Man has been called a creature full of errors. One of the definitions of swaraj is that it is the right to make mistakes and it is true. So long as I do not see my mistakes I must practise the dharma which I consider to be true; if giving in to external pressure I fail to do so, my cowardice and the false image I create will destroy me.
 Further, Mr. Jacks suggests that a society in which external rules of morality are alone regarded as binding may well appear to be well-organized in a certain way, the people may be outwardly happy and peaceful, but that society is devoid of courage, of the boldness to make experiments, and of the spirit of research and hence the path of its progress is blocked. The importance of great principles lies in the fact that their meaning is unlimited. Only if we keep digging in that boundless mine can the world be lit up by those principles and also make progress. However, our society at present appears to be bound in shackles. It seems that our dharma is limited to singing praises of our forefathers and observing some outworn, external rituals.
 But dharma is not such a lifeless thing. Non-violence is a living force or power. No one has been or will ever be able to measure its limits or its extent. Non-violence means universal love, it implies compassion for all living beings and the resultant strength to sacrifice oneself. Since many mistakes may be made while this love expresses itself we cannot give up the quest for the whole of this dharma. Even the mistakes committed while seeking the pure path take us a step forward in the quest.

228,,SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM,"
    
 The draft ruleslibtech_255_footnotelibtech_256_footnoteof the Ashram were published some time back in Navajivan. I had invited outside opinion on these;  a  big controversy had also begun in the Ashram itself. Suggestions were made to introduce vital changes in it. Some of these were even implemented. Despite this a shocking, fictitious report appeared in the newspaper before the time came for publishing these rules. So I must put before the readers the changeslibtech_257_footnotelibtech_258_footnotewhich are being tried at present.
 As the name of the Satyagraha Ashram is suggestive of its qualities, it has always been our endeavour to stick to truth and to rely on its support alone. It cannot be said that we have always succeeded in our efforts. It cannot be claimed that all the inmates of the Ashram have worshipped truth. It can definitely be said that on the whole truth has been adhered to. Even in difficult situations, many in the Ashram, the young as well as the old, have adhered to it.
 Ashramites have found one handicap in insisting upon truth. Many difficulties were experienced in minutely observing the rules with a strictness that would do credit to the Satyagraha Ashram. We did not find ourselves capable of coping with the subtler meanings of the rules, a fact which we gradually realize. Hence we arrived at the decision to keep those very rules intact but to change the name. We could hardly find anyone with the mental attitude in which one does not even feel the desire for possessions, in order to do credit to the Satyagraha Ashram. In observing truth in a manner that would do credit to the Ashram, one should never exaggerate even in a state of swoon. In spite of holding this belief we found it difficult to be always free from this fault. Though we realized that for the observance of brahmacharya, one should be free even from the thought of lust, we found that our control over our minds was very ineffective. In order to practise ahimsa which would do credit to the Ashram, we should have no anger in us, we should harbour no jealousy of one another. We should have the strength to affectionately embrace a thief if he happens to come along. Let snakes, etc., kill us, but we must have the strength to refrain from killing them. We found ourselves far removed from such ahimsa. Thinking on such lines we decided to maintain the Ashram as an ideal and run all its external activities under another name. Industry and physical work have always been the outward manifestations of the Satyagraha Ashram and we can claim that they have brought considerable credit to it. We therefore, assumed the
 
 name of Udyoga Mandir. Satyagraha Ashram would entrust its work to this Mandir and keep for itself a small ground for prayers which are necessary for its existence.
 These changes are being implemented since a month or so ago. The managing committee of the Mandir has the right to  make whatever changes it wants. Nevertheless, after much thought, it has decided to stick to the rules of the Ashram. The only difference is that these rules will remain as ideals and every member will constantly strive towards their fulfilment. The report that those who are not prepared to observe brahmacharya will now be able to join  the Ashram is baseless. The managing committee has especially deliberated over this question and decided that without brahmacharya the Udyoga Mandir cannot be maintained in the spirit of yajna. Industry of any kind whatsoever does not find a place in the Ashram but only such industries are taken in hand which can sustain  the  poorer classes among the people, raise them economically and enable them to make progress. The managing committee has unanimously arrived at a firm decision that these activities could be carried on only if the men and women who take part in it observe brahmacharya. And this is indeed so. Not a single activity in the Ashram can be pursued for economic gain. These activities are developed solely from the standpoint of how best they could be pursued by the people. Those men and women who are engaged in enlarging their families or satisfying their lust can neither obtain nor impart this training.
 The outcome of all this is that those who are working at present in the Satyagraha Ashram in accordance with its rules will carry on the very same activities in the name of Udyoga Mandir. This change of name was necessary for the sake of humility and truth. The organizers will again accept the name Satyagraha Ashram when they gain self-confidence.
 Of course one vital change has been introduced which seemed to be impossible for the Satyagraha Ashram. During the last three months an experiment is being made of running a single kitchen for the entire Ashram. Control of the palate is one of the rules of the Ashram. Accordingly spices, etc., were not used. Some found this very difficult. It was felt that it would be undesirable to do away with a common kitchen. Hence while retaining it, two varieties of food, one spiced and the other unspiced, were introduced. When families cooked separately they used spices in the Ashram. According to the new rules spices had no place, but now they have been included.

 CHI. PRABHUDAS,
 I got your letter. Chhaganlal has replied in detail. I fully appreciate your and Devdas’s being upset. However, the step that has been taken is worthy of our vow of truth. We have no right to retain the name which we cannot live up to. We need not blame anyone for not being worthy of the name, or rather, I should be blamed first and then the others. Everybody tried to give his or her best, but even then they could not live up to the name. Who, then, could be blamed? We will be able to justify the name ‘Udyog Mandir’.
 My unsteadiness is the cause of my growth. According to me, it is not unsteadiness but rather different responses of my inner voice to changing circumstances. If that is how I view myself, I must view in the same manner the institution of which I am the moving spirit. Necessary changes in the imperfect creations of imperfect men are both a cause and a sign of their growth.
 You should do your work there unhurriedly. Do not mind it if you are unable to carry through the plan you had in mind. And never enter into deep waters. Show everything to Mirabehn. Santok has unex-pectedly arrived here today. Jamnalal has been here of course.

The fact is that the Ashram must not possess any secret of any trade. But the Ashram will naturally respect all the confidence that might be given to it.

Meanwhile, I shall correspond with him and provide you with his own undertaking. And when he gives it to you, you may depend upon the undertaking being scrupulously observed.

This was the prompt reply Lalaji sent me upon my wire to him of 	congratulations and enquiry.libtech_272_footnotelibtech_273_footnoteLalaji 	earned the title of Punjab Kesari, i.e., the Lion of the Punjab, 	when most of the present genera- tion were in their teens. All these 	years he has survived the title. For whatever may be said of him or 	against him, he still remains the unchallengeable leader of the 	Punjab and one of the most beloved and esteemed leaders in all 	India. He has been President of the National Congress, enjoys a 	European reputation and is one of the few public men who think aloud 	at the risk of being often misunderstood and more often being 	considered indiscreet. He remains incorrigible; for he cannot 	harbour anything in his breast. He must speak out just as he thinks. 	When, therefore, I read the headline “Lalaji assaulted” and 	discovered how and why, I could not help saying: “Well done! Now 	we shall not be long getting swaraj.” For whether the revolution 	is non-violent or violent, there is no doubt about it that before we 	come to our own, we shall have to learn the art of dying in the 	country’s cause. Authority will not yield without a tremendous 	effort even to non-violent pressure. Under an ideal and complete 	non-violence, I can imagine full transformation of authority to be 	possible. But whilst an ideally perfect programme is possible its 	full execution is never possible. It is therefore the most 	economical thing that leaders get assaulted or shot. Hitherto 	obscure people have been     
 assaulted or done to death. The assault on Lala Lajpat  Rai  has attracted far greater attention than even the shooting of a few men could have. The assault on Lalaji and other leaders has set the politically-minded India athinking and it must have perturbed the Government. I am loath to think that the local Government as a body knew anything of the contemplated assault. If they did and the assault was part of a deliberate plan as in the days of yore, it is so much the worse for the Government. Then of course the Government can only pretend perturbation. I would not mention such a possibility in ordi- nary circumstances, but holding the view that I do about the Govern- ment—the view being based on experience —whilst I should be sorry, it would not surprise me if a discovery was made that the assault was part of a deliberate plan. I admit, that the provocation, viz., the very fact of the boycott, no matter how peaceful, was quite enough without the fraudulent story concocted by the police. I call the police version fraudulent because I would any day trust Lalaji’s word against a host of interested witnesses that the police can bring to its assistance. If I was not convinced that this system of Government is based on force and fraud, I should not have become the confirmed non-co-operator that I am. Indeed Lowes Dickinson in his essay “War, Its Causes and Cure” has shown from sufficient evidence that a war cannot be con- ducted without fraud. Pari passu this Government of ours which professes to hold India by the sword and whose foundations were laid in fraud cannot be sustained without either, except when it undergoes transformation and is based upon popular will and confidence.
 Nor are we to think that the Punjab incident is to be the last of the barbarities committed during the pendency of the Statutory Commission. The boycott of the Simon Commission is a continuing sore for the Commission and the Government. Sir John Simon and his colleagues cannot be contemplating this boycott with equanimity. They have not the courage to acknowledge defeat. The boycott itself has been given additional momentum by the unprovoked assault on the Punjab leaders. The Government will therefore feel itself bound to suppress the boycott by any means that it can command. The Punjab incident therefore I regard as the first trial of strength, the strength of non-violence against violence. Lalaji had no difficulty in restraining the vast crowd behind him in spite of the police provocation. And if throughout the stay of the unwelcome Commission in India, this non-violent policy can be successfully and efficiently carried out, the Government will find much of its occupation gone and the people would have had a striking demonstration of the effectiveness of mass non-violence. The moral therefore I would have national workers to draw from this incident is not to be depressed or taken aback by the
 assault, but to treat it as part of the game we have to play, to turn the irritation caused by the wanton assault into dynamic energy and husband it and utilize it for future purposes.

241,,FACT AND FICTION,"
    
 A friend has sent me a cutting from the Pioneer purporting to be a report of an interview with me and I have seen a Press message in the Bombay papers giving a summary of a further report. Both have grieved me. It would have been nice if Mr. Wildlibtech_274_footnotelibtech_275_footnote, who is the author of these reports, had submitted proofs to me before publishing his  reports. The late Mr. Saunders of the Englishman used to send to interviewed persons proofs for correction or confirmation of the interviews taken by his reporters. I wish that his very laudable and desirable practice was universally followed. It was all the more necessary for Mr. Wild to follow the practice as he had come to the Ashram as an honoured guest sent by his chief and as he had taken no notes while he was interviewing me. Whilst clever reporters have been known to recall from memory an accurate substance of what they had heard without taking notes, even the cleverest will fail to reproduce in full the very words of his victim if he will take no notes. Mr. Wild has been guilty of sins both of omission and commission. He omitted to send me proofs and although he took no notes, he has professed to reproduce my own words. The result is a series of unfortunate misrepresentations. In many respects the reports are a travesty.
 I do not however propose to examine the reports in detail. I would content myself with correcting one mischievous representation. Mr. Wild makes me say that “there is not a man in India today whom he (I) can name as a national leader”. I could never be guilty of making such a false, arrogant and impertinent statement. Fortunately for India, she has not one but scores of national leaders who are able to give a good account of themselves and who need no certificate from me or anyone else. Probably Mr. Wild has confused the question of successor[s] with leaders. I was taken aback when he put me the question about [a] successor. For I have never thought of successors. I believe that a successor will come without effort when one is needed. But a successor even a poor scavenger or spinner may have. He need not be a leader. Once when I was called upon to name a successor I named Gulnar, the daughter of Maulana Mahomed Ali. But she is no
 
 longer now fit to occupy the coveted place. She is no more a baby. My notions of [a] successor remain as primitive now as they were seven years ago when the question was first put to me.

242,,HANDICAP OF MAHATMASHIP,"
    
 The difficulties and afflictions of a “mahatma” are no less serious and very often much more serious than those of misters and shriyuts, not excluding knights and baronets. More than once in my life have I had to battle against these difficulties and afflictions created by unfriendly critics and not unoften through misunderstanding on the part of friends who will not take the trouble of ascertaining the true situation after personal inspection but will unhesitatingly accept as gospel truth any rumour that may appear in print.
 Now what has appeared in the Press about the Satyagraha Ashram was wholly unauthorized.libtech_276_footnotelibtech_277_footnoteWhen one important change in the Ashram was adopted, opinion was divided as to whether without giving  a trial to the great change, we were called upon to take the public into confidence. I yielded to the express wish of some of my trusted co-workers not to announce the change. When I accepted their advice, I knew the consequence. I knew that nothing happening about anything connected with me could escape the attention of newspaper reporters. The published report is altogether misleading.
Here are the plain facts:
 The constitution of the Ashram has not suffered any vital  change except in its name. The reported change about brahmacharya for which I have received from some quarters undeserved congratul- ations and for which anxious friends have shown nervous concern was never made. I did leave it absolutely free to my co-workers to make whatever change they wished. After full delibe-rations among themselves over the proposal to relax the brahm-acharya vow and at the discretion of the Managing Committee to admit married people unprepared for the observance, they came to the unanimous conclu- sion that the change could not be made. I must deal at a future date with the reasoning behind this very important decision.
 The other reported change relates to the introduction of spices in the Ashram. In the beginning, the Ashram had only one joint board when the food was prepared without spices. Later when many families joined the Ashram separate kitchens were set up for them and they
 
 were free to use spices. But it was decided some months ago to revert to the joint kitchen. We tried for some time to do without spices but as I held the joint kitchen to be an important thing for corporate life and as many, if they had separate kitchens, would revert to spices, it was decided to have two varieties of food in the joint kitchen, spiced and unspiced. We want to give all the assistance and freedom the women folk need. Many of them have come to the Ashram because they are the wives of their husbands. They have not yet been able to argue out all the pros and cons of everything they do.
 The real change in my opinion is the change in the name. It has caused the original founders of the Ashram many an anxious night. We claim to be votaries of unadulterated truth and so new possibilities of the definitions of fundamental truths have dawned upon us. The name Satyagraha Ashram was adopted deliberately and with the inten- tion of giving the fullest effect to its meaning. But the progressive realization of the meaning of the name made us conscious of our unworthiness to bear it. And so we resolved upon voluntary self-suppression and we chose a name in keeping with the evolution of the corporate life at the Ashram. If the Ashram has done nothing else, it has at least demonstrated the necessity and usefulness of labour undertaken not for self only but for the whole nation. Therefore the name Udyoga Mandir, I felt, more answered our present evolution than Satyagraha Ashram. The co-workers accepted the suggestion though not without considerable hesitation. ‘Industrial Home’ is a poor rendering of the original as ‘Dominion Status’ or even ‘independence’, is a poor substitute for ‘swaraj’ which alone can signify the great mass longing of India as an individual nation. We do not take up any industry that comes our way. We select only such as we must carry on as a consecration, a yajna (sacrifice) or a kurbani. An industrial home connotes a conglomeration of industries which may appeal to some but which have no universal application. The word ‘Mandir’ has sacred associations and so has ‘Udyoga’ read in the light of the Bhagavad Gita. I must therefore invite friendly critics with the poetic instinct to present me with an English expression that will exactly fit in with the expression Udyoga Mandir. Till I get some good equivalent it must remain untranslatable.
 But the Satyagraha Ashram does not entirely disappear. Whilst it divests itself of its external activities and allows the use of the ground on which the Ashram stands to the Udyoga Mandir—the possession to be resumed at will—the Ashram retains the open prayer ground and therefore its most life-giving activity hoping some day to be able to reabsorb the activities now surrendered. The name Satyagraha Ashram has so many sacred associations, that only the hope of reverting to it
 intact has reconciled us to the change of name to the extent indicated. There is one thing more which I may not omit. It has been openly stated, more secretly whispered, that Mahadev Desai has been
 appointed Chairman of the Managing Committee owing  to  the  inmates having lost confidence in me and as a concession to weakness. This is altogether untrue. The Managing Committee, if the reader will recall the previous description of the Ashram in these pages, was appointed long ago. I ceased for a long interval officially to guide its deliberations. Then at the invitation of the Committee, I took up the active guidance. But when the change in name came, the responsibility of the Chairman seemed to be eased a bit. Hence I withdrew and Mahadev Desai became Chairman once more. The virtual control of the Ashram however still remains with me and will continue to do so, so long as I continue to deserve the affection of my comrades.

 SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, SABARMATI,
 November 9, 1928
 DEAR FRIEND,
 I thank you for your letter and for taking me in your confi- dence regarding the appointment of a successor to Sastriji.
 The proposal to appoint Sir K. V. Reddi does not appeal to me at all. I have not the honour to know the gentleman. As you tell me he is a party man, it would be fatal to appoint a party man. The Agent has to enjoy the confidence of all the Indians there and of all the parties here. I hardly think that Sir K. V. Reddi will be able to possess that confidence.
 The appointment is a most difficult task and it is not an easy thing to replace Sastriji. My own suggestion to you is that you should appoint yourself.libtech_287_footnotelibtech_288_footnoteYou know all that Sastriji has done. Therefore there will be perfect continuity. You proved your mettle in South Africa when you led the Deputation.libtech_289_footnotelibtech_290_footnoteSo  far  as  I  am  aware  you  are  not  a suspect as a party man. The next few years are most important in the life of the little Indian community in South Africa and any mistake in the appointment will prove disastrous. If, therefore, you have  sufficient courage and humility to appoint yourself, the whole diffi-
 
 culty is solved. But if you will shirk the duty or your going is utterly impossible, I suggest your making a desperate effort to secure Prof. Paranjpye. If that fails, in spite of Sastriji’s advice that no officials should be appointed you should have Kunwar Maharaj Singh. I mention his name not because I know him or have ever met him but because Charlie Andrews swore by him as the man next to Sastriji if Sastriji couldlibtech_291_footnotenot be secured as the first Agent.
 If all the three proposals fail, then I would say you should ask Sastriji to appoint his own successor. I can’t go any further. May God help you to a right decision. You must not throw away my first suggestion.
 Yours sincerely,

256,,CRUELTY IN GUISE OF JUSTICE,"
  	I have your letter. Hinduism should certainly be purged of all the 	evil and superstition that have crept into it. Nothing then need be 	a substitute for it. It is, in my opinion, an  all-embracing and 	all-sufficing religion. I 	hope your aunt is quite well now.  Yours 	sincerely,  [MRS. 	VIOLET  C/O] 	MISS BABA 	GUNASEKERA  55 HAMPDEN 	LANE, 	WELLAWATTE, 	COLOMBO  From 	a photostat: S.N. 12994         	Offshoots of the riots between Hindus and Muslims in Surat still 	continue. Although the  fighting  with  sticks  and  daggers  has  	ceased, the battle now goes on in the law-courts. I am still 	receiving letters on  this  subject.  However,  I  am  in  no  	position nor  have  I the ability to become a party to this dispute. 	Nevertheless, when I received two or three letters about a certain 	matter, I considered it my dharma to investigate it. This related to 	a complaint that the editor of     
 the local daily Hindu, Shri Chimanlal Joshi, was taken to the court in handcuffs. As I could not believe this report, I inquired of a trust- worthy friend about it. The latter writes:libtech_297_footnote
 Even a person accused of murder should not be treated in this manner; how then can a gentleman be subjected to such treatment? No Hindu-Muslim problem is involved in this case. No Muslim who has a soul would tolerate such treatment of a Hindu. Similarly, no Hindu who has a soul would tolerate such cruelty towards a Muslim. If cruelty is inflicted and tolerated in this manner, law-courts should be sealed as justice would be defamed. Hence this case deserves to be considered dispassionately.
 Can an accused who has not yet been convicted be led in this way like an animal? One fails to understand the reason for such con- duct. If it is said that this procedure was followed because the allegations against him were of a serious nature, it will amount to sentencing the accused before he is tried. Moreover, one has not heard of any punishment in the Penal Code which involves the putting on of manacles. To do so is not in itself a form of punishment. However, if the prisoner is unruly or if he tries to use his hands threateningly or attempts to escape, he is handcuffed so as to prevent him from resorting to either course. In the present case, there was no danger of the accused, Shri Chimanlal Joshi, raising his hands threateningly or running away. Hence we cannot but conclude that he was handcuffed merely by way of cruelty and for insulting him. It is necessary for both Hindus and Muslims to protest against such callousness.
 It is clear that the prison too is in a primitive condition. Pre- viously, too, I had received a protest in this matter and I had commented on it.
 Let Hindus and Muslims of Surat fight one another to their hearts’ content in the name of Ishwar or Allah; but how can they con- clude that neither of these gods exists and tolerate such cruelty and barbaric conduct?

 I had referred to the Arya Samaj  at  the  Brahmo  Samaj function. I mentioned the good as well as bad points because it was pertinent. I do not know what was reported in the newspapers.

The Arya Samaj has done great service but has all the same shown a lack of liberalism.

 CHI. PRABHUDAS,
 I have been writing since three and a half in the morning. Hav- ing finished the paper, l have resumed the writing. Today is amas.
 One’s body endures only as long as the sense of ‘I’ lasts. That sense of ‘I’ is bound to remain so long as the body lives. We have to get out of this state and learn to rid ourselves of the sense of ‘I’. Whatever we have done so far with the sense of ‘I’ is done. But no more of it now. Live in Tadikhet reducing yourself to zero and go on doing daily whatever work comes to hand or you can think of. Do not build castles in the air. Ponder over ‘One step enough for me’. Go on praying, ‘The night is dark and I cannot see my way. Guard your child.’ Instead of being angry or unhappy when somebody insults you, you should rather be pleased. Your duty to Shantilal is simple. If you have not bound yourself to keep him for one year, you should not let him remain for a year. It is obvious that in Tadikhet, you cannot afford to keep him that long. The lesson to be drawn from this is that an agreement even with a friend should be reduced to writing, not because we do not trust him but because memory is a tricky affair.
 You should under no circumstances let your health deteriorate. If your work with Mirabehn is over, run to Almora. Chhaganlal and Kashi are at Rajkot. Ramdas has settled down in Bardoli."

271,,ALL-INDIA SPINNERS’ ASSOCIATION,"
    
 The Association has now been at work for over two years. It has made steady progress on the business side. Its organization is being gradually perfected. Its finances are on a sound footing. It takes or makes no commitments beyond its ability. But on the score of membership, it has not proved attractive. I confess that not much effort has been made to attract members. The Council has thought it unwise to spend public money in carrying on propaganda in that direction, feeling that those who realize the national importance of hand-spinning and the dignity of labour would of their own accord join the Association. Such however has not been the case. People have not been attracted to the constructive side of national work nor have they developed the capacity for unassuming steady work. Many even of those who joined in the beginning have fallen off.
 Nevertheless the Council does not feel disposed to  alter  the terms of membership but is of opinion that some day or other public workers are bound to realize the importance of hand-spinning for the nation and therefore for themselves, and that some day it will be recognized as a matter of shame for anybody not to spin even as it would be today a matter of shame not to protest one’s loyalty to the country or not to attend on due occasions public meetings.
 But even though the membership has not increased and has not attracted those who would work a big financial corporation like the Association, its finances have grown. It is therefore thought advisable to appoint a permanent Board of Trustees in whom the funds should be vested. With that end in view Sjt. Jamnalal Bajaj, Sjt. C. Rajagopalachari and Sjt. Rajendra Prasad have drafted the following resolutions:
  Whereas 	the All-India 	Spinners’ Association was 	founded on 	23rd September 	1925, as 	an expert and 	independent organization 	for the 	development of 	hand-spinning and khaddar and it was endowed with assets by the 	Indian National Congress 	for the said purpose: 
 Whereas the first Executive Council of the All-India Spinners’ Association under the constitution so framed was to hold office for five years and authorized not only to deal with its assets and to raise further funds for the purposes of the Association, but also to make such amendments in the constitution as may be considered necessary in the light of its experience:
 Whereas the Executive Council since its establishment has raised and in view of the increasing work of the Association must continue to raise from time to time considerable funds from the public:
 Whereas it is found necessary often to enter into agreement, raise funds
 
 by way of loans on the security of its assets, and make commitments going beyond its own lifetime:
 And whereas for these and other reasons, the experience of the last three years has shown that it is desirable to amend the constitution so as to vest the funds and all the assets of the Association in a permanent Board of Trustees who shall hold them for the purposes of the Association and who shall also be the Governing Body of the Association:
 It is hereby resolved as follows:
   That 		the funds 		and assets 		now held by the 		All-India Spinners’ 		Association and 		its various Branches 		henceforth vest in 		a Board 		of Trustees 		who shall also be the Executive Council of the Association.  That 		the said 		Board of Trustees 		and Executive 		Council shall consist of 		the undermentioned 		twelve persons who shall 		hold office for life, 		provided they 		continue to 		be members of 		the Association, 		and three 		other persons elected 		annually by the 		members of 		the Association 		from among its A-Class 		members, provided that 		for this purpose no 		one who has not been on 		the rolls 		continuously for 		two years at 		the time 		of election 		shall be 		entitled to 		vote.

   That 		any vacancy 		occurring by 		reason of 		resignation, death 		or otherwise shall be 		filled up 		by the remaining members 		from amongst A-Class 		members of the Association:   Resolved 	that if 	any member 	fails to send 	his yarn quota for 	six months 	he shall 	cease to be a member.  Resolved 	that the constitution 	be amended 	to embody 	the foregoing 	provisions.  Resolved 	that a 	meeting of 	the members 	of the 	Association be 	convened as 	early as 	possible to 	elect three members to 	the Board of 	Trustees and 	Executive Council under Resolution I, clause 2. 
 It is being circulated among the members of the Council and will be placed before it for adoption at a special meeting to be convened at Wardha on the 18th December next.
 I heartily endorse the proposal. One striking feature about the proposal is that it introduces an element of  election  in  the appointment of trustees. This was not contemplated by any of us when the Council was self-formed. The idea is to make the All India
 
 Spinners’ Association a democratic body as early as it is possible to do so. I invite suggestions from the readers of Young India on the proposal.

 "
272,,AS EVER,"
    
 The Punjab Government’s communique over the unprovoked assault on Lalaji and other leaders exculpates the police  from  all blame which means that the old policy of excusing the police and the military, no matter how they act, continues to reign supreme as ever. This is not to be wondered at. So long as the Government remains irresponsive and irresponsible to the popular will, so long must it be subservient to the police and the military.
 The departmental inquiry proposed by the Government is a further eyewash. It is preposterous to expect Lalaji and the other leaders to stultify themselves by leading evidence before a committee which the people have every reason to distrust. If the Government had been really anxious to know the truth about the incident, they would have appointed a representative committee of a judicial nature which would inspire public confidence and whose findings would command respect. I congratulate Lala Lajpat Rai and his friends on having decided not to lead evidence before the departmental committee. Lalaji has thrown down the challenge. He courts a libel action and undertakes to prove a case which the Government had the hardihood summarily to brush aside.
 But the question that arises from this incident is much larger than the mere demonstration of the truth of Lalaji’s version. For the public, so long as the Government do not prove otherwise beyond doubt, Lalaji’s version stands. The larger question is how are the people to remedy the evil of irresponsible Government. The assault and the bolstering are but a symptom of the great disease of bondage.  I wish that we could all seriously deal with the root of the evil rather than set about cutting off the branches which sprout forth like Ravana’s heads as soon as they are cut off. In other words we have to develop sufficient strength to resist the main disease.
 I dare not enter into the question of remedies. My own remedy is well known. My purpose just now is not to insist upon its acceptance or the acceptance of any particular remedy. I simply plead that it is up to all the leaders of public opinion seriously to concentrate upon finding an expeditious and effective remedy for dealing with the evil of foreign domination.

273,,NOTES,"
    
 FOR REST
 After having been at the Ashram, now Udyoga Mandir,  for nearly eleven months I propose to go to Wardha during the last week of the month to pass a quiet time at the Satyagraha Ashram there. As usual the newspapers have anticipated me and the date of  my departure. They have announced 15th instant as the date. Already correspondents are on my track asking for interviews. I may say that I do not reach Wardha before 24th instant nor leave Sabarmati before 22nd instant.libtech_318_footnotelibtech_319_footnoteBut when I go to Wardha I go there for rest and not for appointments. I would therefore request people living in that neighbourhood to excuse me from all appointments and allow me to have the rest which perhaps I deserve.
 KARACHI SWEEPERS
 With reference to the discussion that took place recently in Karachi Municipality on the question of khadi wear for its employees, the President of the Sweepers’ Union has now sent me the text of a resolution passed by the Sweepers’ Union. It runs as follows:
 The Union notes with regret the discussion regarding khadi uniforms in  a recent Municipal meeting and thanking sincerely the President  of  the Karachi Municipality for the solicitude shown by him for the sweepers, most respectfully and humbly begs to draw his attention to the fact that as agriculturists sweepers have been wearing pankorun, i.e., khadi, for a long time and that the khadi uniforms are not at all inconvenient to them. On the contrary they (the sweepers) appreciate the national sentiment signifying the use of khadi and sympathize with their brothers and sisters, who get much-needed supplementary income by spinning and doing other processes. This Union therefore urges on the Municipality to continue khadi uniforms in future.
 I wonder whether this resolution was passed only by half  a dozen sweepers or whether it was known and explained to all the sweeper employees of the Municipality. The Secretary informs me that it was fully explained to the sweepers before the resolution was passed. It is a resolution which I can gladly commend to all the municipal employees. No compulsion superimposed upon them about khadi or anything else can possibly last; but if an educative propa- ganda such as has been carried on amongst the sweepers of Karachi were to be carried amongst the employees of municipalities through-
 
 out India and if they were to ask for khadi uniforms, no municipality will be able for any length of time to resist such a demand. I therefore congratulate the Sweepers’ Union upon their resolution.
 “GOD IS”
 Having read this article in Young India (11-10-1928) a reader sends the following bracing quotations from Emerson:
 A little consideration of what takes place around us every day would show us that a higher law than that of our will regulates events; that our painful labours are unnecessary and fruitless; that only in our easy, simple, spontaneous action are we strong and by contenting ourselves with obedience we become divine. Belief and love—a believing love will relieve us of a vast load of care. O my brothers, God exists. There is a soul at the centre of Nature, and over the will of every man, so that none of us can wrong the universe.
 The lesson is forcibly taught that our life might be much easier and simpler than we make it; that the world might be a happier place than it is; that there is no need of struggles, convulsions, and despairs, of the wringing of the hands and the gnashing of teeth; that we miscreate our own evils. We interfere with the optimism of Nature.
If we would but have a little faith we would see God and His love
 everywhere about us.
 GREENS AND DIETETIC AHIMSA
A friend writes from  Calcutta:
 You have observed in one of your previous articles on dietetics that it is undesirable to cook the greens since cooking destroys their vitamin contents. Now the Jains believe that all vegetable fare with the exception of ripe fruit contains countless germs invisible to the eye which by setting up putrefaction give rise to a variety of diseases unless the vegetables are cooked. Jain sadhus do not even take water unless it is previously boiled. This view is thus in direct contradiction to your view. Which of these views can be correct? Would you throw some light on the matter?
 I have already expressed my opinion on this point in Nava- jivan.libtech_320_footnotelibtech_321_footnoteIf one may take ripe fruit without cooking I see no reason why one may not take vegetables too in an uncooked state provided one can properly digest them. Dieteticians are of  opinion  that  the inclusion of a small quantity of raw vegetables like cucumber, vegetable marrow, pumpkin, gourd, etc., in one’s menu is more beneficial to health than the eating of large quantities of the same cooked. But the digestions of most people are very often so impaired through a surfeit of cooked fare that one should not be surprised if at
 
 first they fail to do justice to raw greens, though I can say from personal experience that no harmful effect need follow if a tola or two of raw greens are taken with each meal provided one masticates them thoroughly. It is a well established fact that one can derive a much greater amount of nourishment from the same quantity of food if it is masticated well. The habit of proper mastication of food inculcated by the use of uncooked greens, therefore, if it does nothing else, will at least enable one to do with less quantity of food and thus not only make for economy in consumption but also automatically reduce the dietetic himsa that one commits to sustain life. Therefore whether regarded from the viewpoint of dietetics or that of ahimsa the use of uncooked vegetables is not only free from all objection but is to be highly recommended. Of course it goes without saying that if the vegetables are to be eaten raw extra care will have to be exercised to see that it is not stale, over-ripe or rotten, or otherwise dirty.

How I wish that 	this truth could be realized by us all and that Lalaji’s death 	could be turned to good account by the nation by establishing unity 	and promoting perfect toleration for  which Lalaji always stood. I 	know that in his heart there was neither rancour nor ill will for 	anybody. His life was an  open book.  As  a    
 comrade, it was a privilege to work with him; as a friend he was ever faithful. To the student world he was a tower of strength. I know that many will gladly bear testimony to his wise counsel, guidance and patronage. I know that there would be a memorial to the memory of the deceased but I can imagine no truer memorial than work for swaraj and all it implies with redoubled zeal.

  November 	17, 1928  Mahatmaji 	said that Lalaji’s death had left a gap which it was difficult to 	be filled. His was a glorious death and he died a patriot. Mahatmaji 	asked the inmates to take lessons from Lalaji’s life and emulate 	his high sense of duty. I 	do not believe that Lalaji is dead, but he lives.  The 	Tribune, 20-11-1928           	Letters in connection with the calf incident still continue to pour 	in. But I have had my full say already and such letters as needed a 	reply I have already answered. I however feel in duty bound to deal 	with some posers addressed to me by some correspondents. Not to do 	so might lead to consequences not warranted by my action.  I One 	of them writes:  My 	baby is four months old. It fell ill a fortnight after its birth and 	there seems no end of its ailment in sight. Several vaidyas and 	doctors have tried their skill upon him, but in vain; some of them 	now even decline to administer any medicine to him. They feel, and I 	feel with them, that the fate of the poor thing is sealed. I have a 	big family to maintain and I feel myself reduced to sore straits as 	I have an accumulation of debts. Nor can I any longer bear to see 	the terrible sufferings of the baby. Would you kindly tell me what I 	should do in the circumstances ?      Navajivan, 	4-11-1928 and 18-11-1928. 
 It is clear that this friend has not been reading Navajivan carefully or he would not have asked this question. There would be no warrant for taking the life of the baby even if all the doctors in the world were to pronounce the case to be hopeless because it would always be possible for its father to nurse it. He can soothe the baby in a variety of ways, its size unlike the calf’s being manageable. It is only when every possible avenue of service however small is closed and the last ray of hope of the patient surviving seems extinct that one is justified in putting him out of pain, and then too only if one is completely free from the taint of selfish feeling. In the present case, not only is the service of the ailing baby possible, but the main consideration that, on the father’s own admission, weighs with him is the personal inconvenience involved in nursing the baby. Largeness of the family or one’s pecuniary difficulty can never serve as a justifi- cation  for  putting  an  end  to   the   life   of   an   ailing   patient   and I have not the slightest doubt that in the present instance, it is the bounden duty of the father to lavish all his love and care on his suffering baby. There is however one thing more which he can do: if he has sense enough to see it, he should resolve forthwith to lead a life of perfect self-restraint and further stop procreating irrespective of whether his present baby survives or not.

Another friend writes in the course of a Hindi letter:
 I am the manager of. . . goshala. There are in my charge some 500 head of cattle. They are all utterly useless for any purpose and are simply eating their head off. Out of these from 350 to 400 animals on the average are constantly at death’s door, destined to die off one by one in the long end every year. Now tell me what am I to do?
 As I have already explained, giving the short shrift, from considerations of financial expediency, can never be compatible with non-violence. And if it is a fact that not a day passes in this goshala without some animal or other dying painfully in the manner of that calf in the Ashram, it makes out a strong case for closing the goshala at once for it betrays fearful mismanagement. The calf in the Ashram was reduced to such piteous plight only as the result of an accident but daily instances like this should ipso facto be impossible in a well-managed institution. The duty of the management in the present case is thus clear. It is incumbent upon them and upon the organizers of all similarly placed institutions to devise the most effective means of nursing and ministering to the needs of diseased and ailing cattle. I
 would also recommend to them for careful study and consideration my description of an ideal pinjrapole and the way it ought to be managed that I have given more than once in these pages.

Writes a Kanbi friend:
 There is a grazing-ground for the cattle near our village. It is overrun by    a herd of deer about five to seven hundred strong. They work havoc upon all our cotton saplings. We are in a fix. We can easily get rid of them by employing professional watchmen who would kill them for the venison they would get. What would be your advice to a man in my condition? Again when insect pests attack our crops the only way to deal with them is to light a fire of hay which means making a holocaust of the insect pests. What course would you suggest in these circumstances ?
 This question is of a different order from the other  two questions; it falls under the category of the monkey question, not the calf question. I am unable to guide anyone in the path of himsa. In fact no person can lay down for another the limit to which he may commit himsa. This is a question which everybody must decide for himself according to the measure of his capacity for ahimsa. This much however I can say without any hesitation that to use the analogy of the monkeys to justify the killing of the deer would only betray a laziness of thought and lack of discrimination; the two cases are so dissimilar. Besides, I have not yet decided to kill the monkeys, nor is there any likelihood of my doing so presently. On the contrary it has been and shall be my ceaseless anxiety to be spared that painful necessity. Moreover there is quite a number of ways of keeping off the deer from the fields which would be impossible in the case of elusive creatures like monkeys. Whilst therefore reiterating what every farmer knows from his daily experience also to be true, viz., that destruction of small insects and worms is inevitable in agriculture, I am unable to proceed any further, but must content myself by stating generally that it is the sacred duty of everybody to avoid committing himsa to the best of one’s power.
 IV
Still another friend writes:
 You say that an absolute observance of ahimsa is incompatible with life in the body, that so long as a man is in the flesh he cannot escape the commission of himsa in some form or other as the very process of our physical existence involves himsa. How then can ahimsa be the highest virtue, the supreme duty? Would you set forth as the highest religious ideal a code of conduct which is altogether impossible of being fulfilled in its
 completeness by man? And if you do, what would be the practical worth of such an ideal?
 My humble submission is that, contrary to what this writer says, the very virtue of a religious ideal lies in the fact that it cannot be completely realized in the flesh. For a religious ideal must be proved by faith and how can faith have play if perfection could be attained by the spirit while it was still surrounded by its “earthly vesture of decay”? Where would there be scope for its infinite expansion which is its essential characteristic? Where would be room for that constant striving, that ceaseless quest after the ideal that is the basis of all spiritual progress, if mortals could reach the perfect state while still in the body? If such easy perfection in the body was possible all we would have to do would be simply to follow a cut-and-dry model. Similarly if a perfect code of conduct were possible for all there  would be no room for a diversity of faiths and religions because there would be only one standard religion which everybody would have to follow.
 The virtue of an ideal consists in its boundlessness. But although religious ideals must thus from their very nature remain unattainable by imperfect human beings, although by virtue of their boundlessness they may seem ever to recede farther away from us, the nearer we go to them, still they are closer to us than our very hands and  feet  because we are more certain of their reality and truth than even of our own physical being. This faith in one’s ideals alone constitutes true life, in fact it is man’s all in all.
 Blessed is the man who can perceive the law of ahimsa in the midst of the raging fire of himsa all around him. We bow in reverence before such a man; he lays the whole world under debt by  his example. The more adverse the circumstances around him, the intenser grows his longing for deliverance from the bondage of flesh which is a vehicle of himsa and beckons him on to that blessed state which in the words of the poet,
 Even the Great Masters saw only in a trance Which even their tongue could not declare,
a state in which the will to live is completely overcome by the ever
 active desire to realize the ideal of ahimsa and all attachment to the body ceasing man is freed from the further necessity of possessing an earthly tabernacle. But so long as that consummation is not reached a man must go on paying the toll of himsa for himsa is inseparable from all physical existence and it will have its due.

294,,IN QUEST OF REST,"
      
 As already published in the newspapers, I hope to reach the Wardha Satyagraha Ashram not on the 15th but on or about the 25th of this month. I do not, however, expect to do anything there in addition to carrying out my daily routine. As I wish to get as much rest as possible, no one should expect an interview with me there or request me to make speeches. In view of the present state of my health I shall hardly be able to complete in my spare hours the amount of work that I am taking with me to Wardha. I would request all kindly to bear in mind this appeal of mine.

295,,THE LION OF THE PUNJAB SLEEPS,"
      
 As the pages of Navajivan were going to the printing machine on Saturday, the following telegram was received from Lala Lajpat Rai’s son: “Following a heart attack this morning, Lalaji has fallen asleep.” Lalaji’s death means the dissolution of a great planet from India’s solar system. Lalaji was the lion of the Punjab, a brave son of India, a true public servant and a true patriot. It is well-nigh impossi- ble to make a precise assessment of Lalaji’s services of half a century. At this critical juncture for India, Lalaji’s loss is irreparable. Despite this, I would request the people not to be overcome with grief but rather to imbibe his great virtues—his courage, sacrifice, for bearance, generosity, bravery and patriotism, and make a superhuman effort to secure that swaraj for which he lived and died. Blessed indeed is the country which gave birth to such a gem of a son as Lalaji. May God grant peace to his soul and fortitude to his family. The whole of India shares their sorrow.

296,,MISUNDERSTANDING,"
      
 A misunderstanding seems to be afloat in Ahmedabad that a deputation consisting of gentlemen belonging to the pinjrapole had come to reason with me regarding calves and monkeys. This is not a fact. The truth of the matter is that I had asked them to see me in connection with the pinjrapole and the nuisance of dogs. They had kindly come over and while they were with me, I told them of my
 dilemma in regard to the killing of calves and about monkeys and this led to a pleasant little conversation between us.

297,,DIFFICULTIES OF A BOY,"
      
A lad of sixteen and a half writes :libtech_343_footnote
 Many young men must be in such a pitiable plight. What a denial of freedom that they cannot even get letters addressed to them?  I do not believe that parents do any good to their sons and daughters who have reached the age of sixteen by imposing such restrictions upon them for keeping a watch upon their activities in this manner. Such young people who have not still outgrown their cradles cannot, it is clear, worship the Goddess of Independence. Those who live in such a deplorable condition cannot by themselves understand the nature of their dharma. Dharma is not something that can be practised simply by imitating others. It implies supreme effort on the part of oneself.
 Where the environment is so weak, what advice can I give the youth, except to offer civil disobedience? If this young man has courage, he will courteously point out his dharma to his mother. If the mother forbids him to go to a national school, he may not do so but he should at least never go where the atmosphere is unhealthy. He should sit at home and practise whatever trade he can; he may spin, card or sew; he can buy a few carpenter’s tools and practise carpentry; he can read good books and reflect upon them, he can find out the essence of these, he can read to his mother all about Prahlad from the Bhagavata, he can go out for walks daily, do exercise and create a pure and fearless atmosphere around his physical and mental self.
 A boy of sixteen and a half should never lead the life of a householder. Hence he should politely tell his mother that, until he is twenty-one or twenty-five, she should give up the idea of his living with his wife. If this young man and others like him in a like situation inform their parents of their worthy resolve and at the same time are not disrespectful towards the latter and serve them, they will improve
 
 themselves, the parents too will learn a new lesson and the country and dharma will thereby benefit.
 This young man seems to know that human effort by itself is futile. Nothing can be achieved without God’s grace. Not a blade moves without His will. This is something that can be perceived directly. Hence those young men who wish to make this effort must realize its limitations and pray to God every day with unflinching faith regarding their worthy resolves. They may well pray to God as Rama or as Krishna or by any other name that is familiar or dear to them.

298,,I HAVE NOT DONE ANY KILLING,"
      
A gentleman writes:libtech_344_footnote
 I have not read this Jain newspaper. However, if any gentleman who had come to see me has written as above, it is, indeed, a matter of regret. Moreover, it is for me a matter of even greater regret if anyone believes   such   a   story   after   my   denial   in   Navajivan.libtech_345_footnotelibtech_346_footnoteThe   four gentlemen should have realized that I who have on certain occasions advocated the killing of monkeys could not conceivably hide the fact had I killed some. However, who can shut the mouths or stop the pens of those who are bent on speaking or writing ill of others? I repeat here that nowhere in the Ashram or on behalf of the Ashram have monkeys been killed, beaten or injured. There is no doubt in my mind regarding this matter of killing of monkeys or employing others to kill them, as there is still a strict ban on it. I cannot say the same with such certainty about injuring them, because bows and arrows have been used for a day or two and catapults are still being used. As soon as I realized the possibility of a serious injury resulting from the use of bows and arrows, their use was, as I have already written, discontinued. The catapult is still being employed now but I find that the monkeys merely play with it. Nevertheless, I believe that at times it may certainly cause an injury. I do not know, however, of a single instance in which a monkey has been injured in the Ashram as a result of the use of either of these weapons. The killing of monkeys is something that I do not contemplate doing in future either. I know
 
 
 that it involves violence. Hence I shall think again and again before indulging in such an extreme act of violence and I shall also try to find out as many ways as I can of sparing myself that form  of violence. Despite this, I can give the assurance that the world will certainly come to know, if ever an occasion arises in my life, when I employ violence.

299,,ANTYAJAS OF KARACHI,"
      
 One of the good results of the discussion that took place recently in the Karachi Municipality on the question of khadi is that the President of the Sweepers’ Union has now sent me the text of a resolution passed by the Sweepers’ Union. It runs as follows :libtech_347_footnote
 When this resolution was sent to me for publication, the question arose in my mind whether it was passed with understanding by a large number of Antyaja brothers or whether it had been passed for the sake of appearances alone by a handful of them getting together. Moreover, as sweepers were regarded as farmers, the question also arose whether there was any truth in it or was it done for the sake of prestige. So I enquired through the secretary and received the following replylibtech_348_footnote:
 This clarification enhances the importance of the above resolution. And whenever similar resolutions are passed in such associations, their value increases when this is done with understanding and after due deliberation. Because, if such resolutions are passed without proper understanding or if those who pass them or frame them do so for the sake of demonstration, not only do they lose their impact with the passage of time but they are also harmful. Nowadays many such resolutions are passed merely for outward show. I, therefore, felt the need to exercise the above caution. I hope that the Antyaja brothers will act according to the resolution that they have adopted. And if they do so, both they and the country will benefit. It is not enough if they wear khadi when working in the municipality, but if they have the feelings for khadi which they have expressed in
 
 the resolution, they will give place to khadi alone even in their homes. It is the task of the Antyaja Sangh to see that durable and cheap khadi is made available. Recently in Mysore, a khadi  co-operative association has been set up, and such associations can have within them a khadi store on a co-operative basis and obtain khadi at much cheaper rates. Or, one can also follow the practice adopted in Madras where people are able to get khadi at cheaper rates by the system of chits. There is a saying in English: “Where there is a will there is a way.” The truth of this has been proved by experience. Our Bhangi brothers and their leaders can take to heart this saying.

Rest assured that I shall do 	all that is necessary.  Vandemataram 	from  BAPU  From 	a copy of the Gujarati: C.W. 7511. Courtesy: K. M. Munshi           [November 18, 1928]libtech_350_footnote  	My position is somewhat awkward. My relationship with Lalaji had 	become so close that just as one feels embarrassed to praise some 	friend, comrade or brother, I too feel awkward to praise him today. 	Even so, I feel that I should say a few words. I first met Lalaji in 	1914 in England; then his love for the country left a deep 	impression on me. Although I had heard of him earlier through 	newspapers, since I always have little faith in them I did not 	straightway take their reports as true. When he returned to India in 	1920, he was elected President of the Indian National Congress. 	Since then I came into close contact with him. There was a 	difference of opinion between us at the Calcutta     
 Congress, but that did not affect our relations at all. How could it, when Lalaji concealed nothing in his heart and expressed everything frankly? Young people have to draw a lesson from Lalaji’s life. He has left a will. In a message only fifteen days ago, he had said that he had only a few days more to live, that he had grown old and that he did not want to take much part in the agitation concerning the attack on him. That was the work of young people and they should do it.
 Lalaji chanted the mantra of swaraj for fifty years. Youths should take up his work of swaraj. In the work of winning swaraj, Lalaji neither enjoyed peace and happiness himself nor did he allow others to do so. In his time it was not fashionable to go to jail or to undergo a sentence of transportation. At that time there was no fearlessness about going to jail as there is today. I was not in India when Lalaji was exiled from the country. He betrayed no weakness during or after his exile. We must observe the dharma which Lalaji has laid down in his will. Various suggestions will be made to make Lalaji’s memorial a lasting one. All will be in vain if there is not one about winning swaraj. Winning swaraj is the true memorial to Lalaji.
 In the resolution Lalaji has been mentioned as the guardian of the poor and there is significance in it. His heart melted wherever he saw misery. His language was certainly strong, but there was no contempt in it. Lalaji’s heart was full of universal love. He concealed nothing from the people, why should he conceal anything from his co-workers? Lalaji was such a kindhearted person that his heart melted if he saw anyone unhappy either in India or abroad. He did not have the slightest enmity towards the Muslims. It was his innermost desire that the Hindus and the Muslims should live as brothers. He wanted that in India there should be neither Hindu rule nor Muslim rule but a rule of all the people. Lalaji’s life began with religious activity and social reforms but he felt that as long as India did not get indepen- dence, nothing could be done about religious or social reforms. Like Lokamanya Tilak, he was compelled to plunge into politics.
 The duty of everyone—young and old—is to free the country from the yoke of dependence. If we do not make our contribution in shouldering that burden, praising Lalaji would only amount to imitating bards and minstrels. He went on working for swaraj single-mindedly for fifty years without ever getting disappointed. Till the last days of his life, he kept on thinking about swaraj. May God give us the strength to achieve the object for which he expended his whole life.

In case a dispute regarding the fact of membership or resignation of a member in the mill is not settled between the Labour Union and the mill and regarding which the Mill-owners’ Association and the Labour Union also do not come to an amicable settlement, the matter shall be submitted to arbitration and the subscription shall continue to be collected and paid to the Labour Union till the final settlement. The Union shall refund the subscription of any operative in respect of whom it is proved that he was not a member at the time of collection.

 "
305,,LONG LIVE LALAJIlibtech_354_footnote,"
      
 Lala Lajpat Rai is dead. Long live Lalaji. Men like Lalaji cannot die so long as the sun shines in the Indian sky. Lalaji means an insti- tution. From his youth he made of his country’s service a religion. And his patriotism was no narrow creed. He loved his country because he loved the world. His nationalism was international. Hence his hold on the European mind. He claimed a large circle of friends in Europe and America. They loved him because they knew him.
 His activities were multifarious. He was an ardent social and religious reformer. Like many of us he became a politician because his zeal for social and religious reform demanded participation in politics. He observed at an early stage of his public career that much reform of the type he wanted was not possible until the country was
 
 freed from foreign domination. It appeared to him, as to most of us, as a poison corrupting every department of life.
 It is impossible to think of a single public movement in which Lalaji was not to be found. His love of service was insatiable. He founded educational institutions; he befriended the suppressed classes; poverty wherever found claimed his attention. He surrounded young men with extraordinary affection. No young man appealed to him in vain for help. In the political field he was indispensable. He  was fearless in the expression of his views. He suffered for it when suffering had not become customary or fashionable. His life was an open book. His extreme frankness often embarrassed his friends, if it also confounded his critics. But he was incorrigible.
 With all deference to my Mussalman friends, I assert that he was no enemy of Islam. His desire to strengthen and purify Hinduism must not be confounded with hatred of Mussalmans or Islam. He was sincerely desirous of promoting and achieving Hindu-Muslim unity. He wanted not Hindu Raj but he passionately wanted Indian Raj; he wanted all who called themselves Indians to have absolute equality. I wish that Lalaji’s death would teach us to trust one another. And we could easily do this if we could but shed fear.
 There will be, as there must be, a demand for a national memorial. In my humble opinion no memorial can be complete without a definite determination to achieve the freedom for which he lived and died so nobly. Let us recall what has after all proved to be his last will. He has bequeathed to the younger generation the task of vindicating India’s freedom and honour. Will they prove worthy of the trust he reposed in them? Shall we the older survivors—men and women—deserve to have had Lalaji as a countryman, by making a fresh, united, supreme effort to realize the dream of a long line of patriots in which Lalaji was so distinguished a member?
 Nor may we forget the Servants of People Society which he founded for the promotion of his many activities, all designed for the advancement of the country. His ambition in respect of the Society was very high. He wanted a number of young men all over India to join together in a common cause and work with one will. The Society is an infant not many years old. He had hardly time enough to consolidate this great work of his. It is a national trust requiring the nation’s care and attention.

307,,AJMAL JAMIA FUND,"
      
 I know that this Fund has to work under a heavy handicap. It has to cut its way through the hard rock of prejudice. Why should a Hindu pay to perpetuate the memory of a Mussalman and for a fund principally devoted to a Muslim cause will be the argument of many a kattarlibtech_355_footnoteHindu in these times of mutual hate. Why should a Mussalman subscribe to a fund in memory of one who was pro-Hindu and for an institution partly supported by the idolatrous Hindu will be the argu- ment of a kattar Mussalman against supporting the Fund. In spite, however, of this double handicap I must continue to ask for subs- criptions for this memorial. The constitution of the Jamia Millia has undergone a radical and desirable change and is placed on a better footing. And I am happy to be able to announce the subscription for this fund of Rs. 10,000 already paid up from a Hindu friend whose trust, I confess, is largely based on my own. I know no other way of promoting nationalism, toleration and friendliness except by trusting and hoping in spite of appearances to the contrary. It matters little that one may have been deceived before or may have built hope on a paper foundation. Hope to be worth anything must “spring eternal in the human breast”. Trust can have no limits. It must always give the benefit of the doubt. It is better to suffer a million disappointments than not to have trusted where mistrust was a mistake. A man who permits himself to be deceived is never the loser. Indeed he is the gainer in the end, not the so-called successful deceiver. A thousand deceits would leave me unrepentant. My personal experience is that in
 
 spite of some very hard knocks which I can recall at the time of writing, I have no cause to regret the trustful nature with which the world around me has credited me. It is my conviction that I and those whom I have involved in my trustfulness have lost nothing, if we cannot prove to have always gained. A man loses only when he loses his soul and that can never be lost through another man’s deceit.

 CHI. GANGABEHN,
 I felt unhappy when leaving you. You are bearing with great courage the burden which has fallen on you, but I see all the same that it has disturbed your equanimity a little. The Gita, however, teaches us that we should in no case lose our equanimity.
 You may certainly take any quantity of milk that is necessary for your health. Do not feel that you are doing anything wrong in that.

  	You should understand that I shall always be where my work calls me.  	One should accept as they are the rules and conditions for mem- 	bership of an organization or an institution. If we live as memb-ers 	of an organization, it becomes necessary for us to obtain the 	perm-ission    
 of others for doing a number of things. Freedom does notmean licence, nor does it mean being dependent on one individual only.
 Anyone who lives in a community should submit to its restrictions. This is what an institution means. Anything different from this means the rule of one person. I wish that you should reflect and understand the meaning of this, compose yourself and be devoted to your duty.
 Take proper care of your health. Cultivate friendship with everyone.
 Give complete satisfaction to others in regard to Manu, by working in the Bal Mandir and, if you find it congenial to do so, in the kitchen.

 [After November 23, 1928]
 I have no doubt about it, there are more actual spinners and more genuine khadi wearers in India today than there were in the “white cap” days of 1920-21, and as for organized khadi production it has grown by tenfold at least. But the thing is, we do not see the wood for the trees. Otherwise, where is there another organization in India which is functioning in nearly 2,000 villages as the A.I.S.A. is doing? It is a compact body, it has influence over the masses because it has established a living contact with them. But the khadi  worker
 
 must bide his time. His faith is on trial today. He must refuse to be diverted from his purpose by exciting politics. I have no doubt that the country will remember this perennial source of strength at no distant date. See how one leader after another turns to it for conso- lation in the darkness of despair. Deshbandhu Das remembered it and declared his faith in it a week before his death, and when a damp fell around the path of Lalaji he too turned to it for strength. You know how he told Mahadev at Simla that he had become a complete convert to khadi and was learning how to spin? I have no doubt that in its hour of darkness it will be khadi alone that will come to the nation’s rescue.

WARDHAlibtech_378_footnote","
      
 [After November 24, 1928]
 Gandhiji: Is your objection religious and fundamental or is it on the score of social tradition?
 We are no learned pundits, our objection is based on the latter ground.
 In that case you should bear with Shethji. If you objected to Shethji’s dining with such ‘untouchables’ as were addicted to drink or led unclean lives I could understand you, but for lack of moral courage to hold that food is polluted by the mere touch of one born in a so-called untouchable family, though otherwise he may be a pure and righteous man, is a negation of religion. I admit that social tradition should be respected when it is meant for the protection of society even though personally one may not feel any need for following it, but to respect a tradition even when it becomes tyrannous spells not life but death and it should be discarded.
 Jamnalalji has chosen a wider field of service. He cannot exclu- sively identify himself with any particular community. The world is his family and he can serve his community only through the service of humanity. So let Jamnalalji go his way. One can overcome opposition only by love, untruth by truth, not by compromising truth. See the state of society we are living in, it is full of falsehood,
 
 hypocrisy,  hatred.  Our   panchas   should   be   the   Gangotrilibtech_379_footnoteof   our society. But today they have become corrupt. What would be left of the sacredness of the Ganges if its stream were polluted at the very source? Let us therefore try to purify our panchas, by doing penance, by suffering for right’s sake. That is what Jamnalalji is doing. You should give him your blessings even if you cannot follow him. For, a day will come when not only you but even the orthodox section will recognize that by his action Jamnalalji rendered the truest service to Hinduism and the future generation will thank him for it.libtech_380_footnote

322,,INFLUENCE OF MUSIClibtech_381_footnote,"
      
A student of the Gujarat Vidyapith asks:
 What has been the influence of music on your life?
 Music has given me peace. I can remember occasions when music instantly tranquilized my mind when I was greatly agitated over something. Music has helped me to overcome anger. I can recall occasions when a hymn sank deep into me though the same thing expressed in prose had failed to touch me. I also found that the meaning of hymns discordantly sung has failed to come home to me and that it burns itself on my mind when they have been properly sung. When I hear Gita verses melodiously recited I never grow weary of hearing and the more I hear the deeper sinks the meaning into my heart. Melodious recitations of the Ramayana which I heard in my childhood left on me an impression which years have not obliterated or weakened. I distinctly remember how when once the hymn “The path of the Lord is meant for the brave, not the coward” was sung to me in an extraordinarily sweet tune, it moved me as it had never before. In 1907 while in the Transvaal I was almost fatally assaulted, the pain of the wounds was relieved when at my instance Olive Doke gently sang to me “Lead Kindly Light”.
 Let no one infer from this that I know music. On the contrary it would be more correct to say that my knowledge of music is very elementary. I cannot critically judge music. All I can claim is that I have a natural ear for good homely music.
 I do not mean to suggest either that because the influence of music has been uniformly good on me it must act similarly on others.
 
 On the contrary I know that many people employ music to feed their carnal passions. To sum up, therefore, we may say that the influence of music will differ according to temperaments. As Tulsidas has sung:
 The Lord of Creation created everything in this world as an admixture of good and evil. But a good man selects the good and rejects the evil even as the fabled swan is said  to  help himself to cream leaving the water in the milk.

 PLAN FOR CATTLE DEVELOPMENT
 An experienced gosevaklibtech_382_footnotelibtech_383_footnotefrom Kathiawar writes:libtech_384_footnote
 This scheme is good and deserves to be put into practice. However, if indeed I had the capacity for inspiring people which this correspondent imagines that I have, I would convert all the States of Kathiawar into places for serving the cow ideally. But, like the people, the States too do not like the constructive work very much. Moreover, such tasks could be easily accomplished if the States were not eager to accumulate wealth, if they opposed cruel customs and  cultivated  public opinion. Students should be given such problems to study in national schools. Such problems will be solved with less difficulty when the educated classes come into contact with villages.
 A CRUEL CUSTOM
A gentleman from Visavadar writes:libtech_385_footnote
 I must admit my ignorance of the practice mentioned in this letter. It is clear that this practice should be ended wherever it is prevalent. Our superstitions have been added to our ignorance of cattle-rearing and hence our task has become doubly difficult. There are wise men in every village. They do not have the leisure to examine minutely the question of how the people can be made happy. They know that the task of increasing the cattle wealth is not one which brings in huge profits but one which at the outset entails a large
 
 expenditure. Hence who can create an interest in it? Nevertheless, the above-mentioned scheme deserves consideration at the hands both of the ruler and the ruled. Hence after keeping it in my files for many months, I venture to publish it in the columns of Navajivan today.

WARDHA,
 
     DEAR 	SISTERS,  Silence 	Day, November 26, 1928 
  	We reached Jalgaon an hour late. Consequently we missed the 	connecting train and reached Wardha late.  	I may at once draw your attention to one thing I see here. I am, of 	course, dining in the Ashram kitchen here. By now I have had three 	meals; there was an utter absence of all noise. It was perfectly 	quiet and I thought at that time of the loud din in our Ashram 	kitchen. There was no noise here of clattering vessels or of people 	talking. Of course, in our Ashram we have children, while here there 	are none. That does make some difference, and yet you can teach 	children not to make noise and you yourselves can withstand the 	temptation of talking. That we cannot put a stop to the noise in our 	kitchen is one of our great failings.  	I keenly feel the separation from you, because much remains to be 	done for getting more work from you. You should complete what 	remains unfinished.  	Of course you understand your duties. The kitchen, Bal Mandir 	(kindergarten) and prayers are even now going on; if you undertake 	any other responsibility besides these, never give it up out of a 	sense of failure. To become fit for it the most necessary condition 	of all is this:  	Whatever work you once undertake, carry it out fully, never give up 	what you have offered to do. If you have to be absent, then make 	some arrangement for your work; and if no arrangement  can  be made, 	do not leave it and go.  	Keep ever cheerful; be calm; and make it a point to carry on your 	share of all the activities of the Ashram equally with men, and as 	well as men. This is not at all beyond your capacity. You need only 	desire it, and strive for it.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  Letters 	to Ashram Sisters, 	pp. 61-2 "

330,"November 26, 1928","APPEAL FOR LAJPAT
RAI MEMORIAL FUNDlibtech_390_footnote","
      
 November 26, 1928
 The following appeal has been issued over the signatures of the President of the Congress, Dr. Ansari, Pandit Madan Mohan Malavi- yaji and Sheth Ghanshyamdas Birla:
 APPEAL FOR FIVE LAKHS
 
TO THE CITIZENS OF INDIA
 It is but meet that there should be a national memorial to the revered memory of a patriot so brave, so great and so self-sacrificing as Lala Lajpat Rai. We the undersigned have therefore taken it upon ourselves to make an appeal to the generous public for funds, which we hope will meet with universal response. If we expect large dona- tions from the rich, we know that Lalaji’s spirit would find the greatest solace from the coppers of the poor. We propose to announce later the exact manner in which the funds will be used, but we constitute ourselves as trustees for the funds with power to associate others with us in their administration. We may, however, generally state that we shall use them for the advancement of Lalaji’s many political activities to which he so nobly gave the best part of his life. We shall naturally bear in mind his great creation and the instrument of his operations— the Servants of the People Society.
We have fixed the sum of Rs. 5,00,000 (five lakhs) as the mini-
 
 mum that a grateful country should give to Lalaji’s memory. Regard being had to the bad times through which we are passing, we have chosen the lowest sum consistently with Lalaji’s all-India greatness and the cause to which the monies are to be devoted.
 Subscriptions  should  be   sent   to   Sjt.   Ghanshyamdas   Birla, 8 Royal Exchange Place, Calcutta, who has kindly consented to act as Secretary and Treasurer for the Fund.
 M. A. ANSARI MADAN MOHAN MALAVIYA
 GHANSHYAMDAS BIRLA
 26th November, 1928
 I have seen also the appeal issued by the President of the Con- gress fixing the 29th instant for observing in memory of the deceased patriot. I heartily endorse both these appeals, and I trust that meetings will be held throughout the country at which subscriptions will be collected in aid of the proposed memorial. Indeed it would be a striking demonstration if a fixed determination was made by all the public workers to finish on the memorial day the collection of five lacs which the distinguished signatories have asked for as  the minimum.
 I know that the time left for organizing such an effort is short; but where there is one will and one purpose no time is too short. Let the public recall the palmy days of 1920-21 when not five lacs but even 10 lacs were collected in one single day. After all the crore was collected practically in one month. If trusted volunteers will set apart the 29th for this one single item and go out collecting, there should be no difficulty in making up the amount.
 Let the collectors remember that they have all to make their return immediately to Sheth Ghanshyamdas Birla at the address given in the appeal. If the collectors will send me the names intimating that they have sent the collections to Sjt. Birla, I shall see that the names are duly acknowledged in Young India. They are free to send the collections to Young India office from which they will be forwarded to the treasurer. If however the task of collecting the full sum in one single day is considered in our present disorganized  state  to  be beyond our capacity let the collection committee prolong the period for collecting their quota.
 In the absence of any other rule, I suggest each district or taluk fixing its own quota according to its own population. That is the least that can be done. The fairest way is for each district, taluk or circle to fix its own quota, in no case less than the minimum on the basis of population and to fix its own period within which to finish that
 
 collection. I suggest also a resolution at each meeting to do some constructive work in terms of swaraj for which the local workers may be best fitted, provided that there is a determination to carry out that resolution. The memory of the deceased patriot will not suffer if no such resolution is passed, but it will suffer so long as the memory is a trust in our charge if after having passed resolutions we forget all about them.

            WARDHA, 
  November 	26, 1928  BHAISHRI 	MADHAVJI,  	From your age I guess that you are married. If so, you should avoid 	sex with your wife for some time. If you have any other weak- ness, 	you should give up that also. Your asthma will certainly be cured.  	Another fast will certainly benefit you.  Drop the evening meal. Do 	not take any salt at all for the present. In fruit do not eat 	anything sour. Tomatoes are not necessary. Try to live on mosambi, 	sweet grapes and milk. Take boiled fruit in case of 	constipation.  	Brown bread is more easily digested than our chapatis. Butter 	is lighter than ghee and probably contains more vitamins. For two or 	three months you should live in a place with a dry climate. Marwar, 	Cutch or Kathiawar would be good, except for the ports. 
 If you do not know pranayam learn it. Do it every day  on empty stomach. Have Kuhne’s bath also every day on an empty stomach. You should take sun-bath in the morning before nine o’clock. Sun-bath has to be had without any clothes on. You can cover the head if you feel the heat. I do not think Calcutta is good at all for sun-bath.
 You must go for a walk every clay. On rising in the morning drink a glass of warm water immediately after brushing your teeth.
Avoid sugar. You may take honey with water.
 One can live only on fresh fruit if confined to bed. But if one wants to be active, it will be sufficient to take a little milk along with fruit.

  	You should not leave either home or your wife. You should continue 	to live there and sleep in in a separate room. You should make some 	arrangement to educate your wife. I feel after reading your letter 	that you will not be able to save yourself by running away. You have 	got to solve the problem remaining where you are. You will succeed 	if you try.

From 	a copy of the Gujarati : Kusumbehn Desai’s Diary. S. N. 32577/25           November 	27, 1928  	I hope there will be a prompt and whole-hearted response to the 	appeal which the Congress President, Dr. Ansari, Bharat Bhushan 	Pandit Malaviya and Sheth Ghanshyamdas Birla have made to the people 	in regard to the Lalaji Memorial. There is an English proverb to the 	effect that he who gives quickly gives double. There is a similar 	saying among us: “Prompt charity brings greater spiritual merit.” 	Both these sayings are the result of the experience of wise men of    
 different countries. We have forgotten that saying. Today it is said about us that we always wake up late, that is to say, instead of giving donations or taking action at the right time, we allow time to pass and then become impatient and bewildered and somehow get through charity or work. As a result, this does no credit to us and its value is reduced by half. I hope that this will not happen with regard to this memorial. For a memorial that is to be raised to a popular leader like Lalaji, funds ought to come forth for the asking.
 I trust no one will question why there are only three signatories to the appeal. There was difficulty in finding more names and there was a fear that, if time elapsed, the 29th would pass by; moreover, procrastination in such matters is dangerous.
 In fact, if the magic is not there in Lalaji’s name, the power of three, or even thirty, signatures cannot attract funds. Even great men can get money only for a good cause.
 Hence, donors have merely to assure themselves about the safety of their money and its good deployment. From this point of view, nothing could possibly be said against these three persons. Moreover, every donor must rest assured that where a man like Ghanshyamdas Birla is treasurer and secretary, the accounts will be properly kept.
 Having thus known the amount needed for the memorial and its guardians, the duty of every patriot and everyone desiring swaraj is clear. Everyone should contribute his share to the Fund according to his capacity. It is my request that the whole sum should be subscribed by the 29th. I am writing this article on the 27th. Though I have said that the entire sum should be subscribed by the 29th,  I  do  not entertain great hopes about it. Hence I write this article assuming that the whole sum has not been collected by the time the reader has this article in his hands and, if my fears prove true, those who have not given their share or who have not got their neighbours to subscribe, should get that money in time and forward it to the treasurer. If anyone wants to subscribe through Navajivan, he can do so. His contribution will be acknowledged in Navajivan and it will be forwarded to the treasurer.
 I hope that every man and woman will contribute his or her share to this Fund. The number of students attending schools and colleges alone is 27,00,000. If all of them donate half the amount of their monthly pocket-money and make a sacrifice of their enjoyments to that extent, they can contribute a huge sum without any effort. It will be more creditable if 5,00,000 men, women, labourers, Antyajas and students together donate Rs. 5 lakhs than if five or ten rich men give that amount. It is evident that our strength to win swaraj will grow
 in proportion to the increase in our capacity to collect big amounts by virtue of the numerical strength of those able to pay only small sums. One need hardly say that the value of Rs. 5 lakhs received from 5 lakhs of men and women is very much greater than the same sum received from a few wealthy persons. Thus we serve two purposes in collecting funds by taking a little from many people. Hence I hope that, keeping this in mind, every volunteer will collect as much as possible from his friends and relatives.
 I also hope that our Antyaja brethren will not forget this work. Even if they donate copper coins, they will bring credit to the memorial and to themselves. Lalaji commenced his life with service of the Antyajas and, till the end, he got his followers to do this work. I hope our Antyaja brethren will not forget this fact.
 I hope no one will waste his time in commenting that if the memorial had some other object in view it would have looked better or brought in more funds. In this world nothing done by man is perfect, and there is always room left for criticism. But it will be consi- dered improper to waste time criticizing a good work that has been commenced, or not to assist it because the memorial does not fall in line with one’s ideas. It is the dharma of all those who hold that there should be an all-India memorial to Lalaji and that those who have visualized it and ask for contributions towards it are worthy men, to contribute to the best of their ability and make others do so and only afterwards engage themselves in other national activities.

 DEAR LALA KISHANCHAND,
 Sjt. Banker has sent me a copy of your letterlibtech_394_footnotelibtech_395_footnoteabout fixing a Lajpat Rai week for khadi hawking and collections. Nothing would please me better than to do this. But I have not the slightest desire to exploit the great name of Lalaji for khadi or anything else. I can therefore only fix the week if all the members of the Servants of the People Society sincerely desire and feel as Lalaji felt during the recent months that khadi should be the centre of all constructive work in terms of millions. I therefore had not even dreamt about doing anything in the name of Lalaji. But now that you have mentioned it and Dr. Gopichand approves of your suggestion, I discussed it somewhat with Lala Jagannath. You may show this letter to the other members of the Society and if they all sincerely desire the fixing of a week for khadi propaganda and if they will make khadi the central activity in future, I will gladly fix the week. If they have no such faith, I am sure it will be wrong to adopt your proposal. Let khadi wait for the psychological moment which must arrive some day, if even some of those who are now in charge of khadi organizations in various partsof the country have a living faith in khadi are sincere and are devoting all their spare energy to its success.libtech_396_footnote

 DEAR NIRANJAN BABU,
 I saw your letter to Mahadev. Mahadev is not with me as he had to be in Bardoli with reference to the Bardoli Inquiry. There is no change in my eating periods. Food also almost remains the same. I have cut down the quantity of milk, but no elaborate precautions should be taken to ensure the quantity of goat’s milk or fruit. The less expense undergone about personal comfort the better pleased I shall be. Every anna spent on such things is an anna lost to the poor. Let the Sambalpur Committee also know this working of my mind.
 I have discovered that the letter I thought I had sent, after all never went to you. I am now trying to have it translated and forwarded to you.

 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 I have your two letters. I note what you say about Baidya-  nathji.
 Rajendra Babu did send a reply to the Chronicle about Anil Babu’s writings. They may not have any effect on your side, but in Bombay they might have some effect, especially as the Chronicle gave his contribution a place of honour. But I quite agree with you that generally all these superfluous writings betraying hostility may be safely ignored.
 With me confusion is getting worse confounded with regard to the Exhibition. Motilalji writes to me that the Committee has accepted my view of what an Exhibition should be. But I have heard nothing from Dr. Bidhan. I therefore telegraphed to him yesterdaylibtech_398_footnoteand I am now waiting for his reply. The cutting you sent me is certainly bad.
 
 I am sorry about Krishnadas. Tell him he must be well and strong. When I come to Calcutta I want to see him in good health.
 The progress you have made in the common kitchen is quite encouraging.
 We have now installed our own bakery in the Ashram. You will remember I talked to you about it. The bread turned out is extremely good and has proved popular and saved much time, labour and fuel. Making chapatis occupied the best part of the time of the workers in the kitchen. Chapatis still remain, but bread has supplemented them with many. All eat bread only for breakfast and the evening meal. For the mid-day meal many still take chapatis.
 I hope Hemprabhadevi is keeping well and cheerful. Tarini must really build up his shattered body.
 Yours sincerely,

         CHI. 	KUSUM,         November 	27, 1928 
  	I have both your letters. I was indeed afraid that you would get 	fever. See that you do not get it again. It would help if you take 	chiretta or Sudarshan powder regularly; or else you may take 	quinine from time to time and also Kuhne baths. Ba told me today 	that, after you had recovered, you used to eat cashew nuts. If this 	is true, it would make me unhappy. I expect you to control your 	palate. You will be a good girl if you give up the habit of eating 	things every now and then.  	You thought it strange that you had to obtain permission from two or 	three persons. The Secretary’s permission should of course be 	obtained. But it is also necessary to obtain the permission of the 	head of the department in which you are working. In a big 	institution, the Secretary cannot take upon himself the 	responsibility of  granting leave to everyone. The application for 	leave should be made to him through the head of the department 	concerned. Anyone who under- stands his or her responsibility 	towards the institution will apply for leave only if circumstances 	are convenient. I did not say all this to you to put you off. I 	thought you had immediately grasped my point. I am pained to know 	that you had not, and that you still think that I was putting you 	off. Now that I tell you that I was not trying to put you 
 off, you will feel surprised and think the procedure rather strange.
 Anyone who wants to do all work in love has no choice but to reduce himself or herself to zero. How often have I explained this to you? Love is the utmost depth of humility. Today I  stop  this discussion here.
 Ba is worrying about Manu. Who will help her now to wash and dress her hair and to wash her clothes? She goes on asking these and no end of similar questions. I have told her that I am sure you are looking after these things either by yourself or with somebody’s help.
 Sarojini Devi must be doing her share of work. Does she remain cheerful?
 A handkerchief of mine is left behind there. Prabhavati probably knows where it is. Inquire about it. If you get hold of it, keep it somewhere carefully.
I will not like it if you let your health suffer.

 BHAISHRI CHHAGANLAL,
 I got both your letters. Chi. Santok cannot be given any money for the grain she is returning. That grain and whatever else she has in her possession is the property of the Ashram. Explain this patiently to Chi. Rukhi, etc., or ask Narandas to do that. If truth is combined with love, your decision will always be correct. But do not fail in your duty out of fear of committing mistakes.
 The persons who had been working with Narandas are leaving him one by one. Put others in their place, if necessary. It is essential that you two should work in complete harmony. How this can be brought about is for you to consider.
Gangabehn never told me  what  you  write  to   me  concerning

 I 	have your telegram.libtech_403_footnotelibtech_404_footnoteI sent the following reply:  	“Your wire. Having read Exhibition advertisement see great 	conflict our ideals. Would therefore urge you go your way leaving me 	alone.—Gandhi”  	Before your telegram was received, early in the morning today I 	dictated a letter to Pandit Motilalji from which I extract the 	enclosed apposite paragraph.  	There remains very little for me to add to it. I have seen the 	advertisement sheet about which I would like to say one word. It 	contains no restrictions as to exhibits. It offers among other items 	a riotous worship of goddess Vani. The Exhibition authorities are 	said to have approached all local Governments for exhibits. Apart 	from this indiscriminate permission for all and sundry exhibits, I 	am unable to endorse the approach to local Governments one of which 	only the other day dealt shamelessly by one of the bravest sons of 	India and which had the temerity to bolster up the unprovoked 	assault. Nor am I in a mood to go in for enchanting music and 	riotous displays. But I have no business to interfere with your 	programme. You are the best judges of what is good for the nation 	from your own standpoint. Only I should find myself absolutely 	lonely in that Exhibition. There is a clear clash of ideals. I do 	not expect through correspondence to convert you nor will you expect 	to convert me. It is surely better therefore to leave me out of 	account. I would not on any account have you to deflect yourself 	from your course, simply for the sake of pleasing me.  Yours 	sincerely,  DR.

 SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, WARDHA,
 November 28, 1928
  	I have your letter of the 15th instant. I waited all these days for 	a confirmation from Dr. Bidhan Roy or Subhas, but I have none up to 	the time of dictating, that is, 28th morning. I wired on Monday to 	Dr. Bidhan. There is no reply. Meanwhile I have seen a cutting which 	 I send you herewith. They are evidently inviting local Governments’ 	co-operation. Evidently now all distinction has vanished and the 	Exhibition will be a more spectacular display  than  an  instructive 	effort designed to educate the poor cultivator and the other public. 	There is a gratuitous mention there of khadi. But there is no room 	in this Exhibition for me or khadi in the real sense. Evidently it 	will not exclude either foreign cloth or foreign anything. I cannot 	say I am not grieved over this, but I do not want you to carry the 	matter any further. I write this letter merely for your information. 	I do not seek your intervention for a mechanical change of opinion 	or for a mechanical respect for my wishes. I must cut my way through 	these grievous difficulties with patient toil. After all Dr. Bidhan 	and Subhas represent a definite school of thought. Their opinion is 	entitled to my respect as I expect theirs for my own. That which is 	in the interest of the people will prevail in the long run. Who can 	decide beforehand which is the correct opinion in terms of the 	multitude?  	I see you are having no end of difficulties with Mussalman friends 	regarding your report. But I see you are unravelling the tangle with 	consummate patience and tact. May your great effort be crowned with 	full success.  	From your note I gather that the Convention will meet not on the 	22nd December but on the 26th, 27th and 28th, the dates on which the 	Muslim League is to meet. Or, am I to understand that the Convention 	will formally meet on the 22nd and continue its session till the 	28th? I do not see the slip referred to in the note. Hence the 	little confusion in my mind. Surely, you do not want me to be in 	Calcutta all these days.  	From our conversation at Sabarmati I had understood that you would 	want me for the Congress and not the Convention. For myself I do not 	know what possible service I can render at the Convention. There is 	utter confusion in my mind created by the kaleidoscopic scenes going 	on before one in the country. All I can say is that I do not envy 	your position. But I know you are as much at home with 
 such things as I am with the charkha. And if you will agree to the arrangement, I should be content to remain at the wheel and leave you to the joys of meandering through the intricate paths of diplomacy. But my fate is in your hands until you give your decision. Meanwhile I drink in the peace and the silence that Jamnalalji has provided for me in Wardha.
 You will have seen the appeal about Lalaji Memorial.  After much telegraphing to the Punjab friends, I decided that there should be no more signatures to the Memorial than the three that have appeared. It would have taken a long time to have got the consent of all the men who were mentioned as signatories. They insisted upon at least your and my name appearing together with the three. But I vetoed the proposal anticipating your approval of the veto. You will however please do whatever you can for the Fund, due regard being had to your taxing appointments.
 I see that you have to  begin  with  the  first  letter  of  the alphabet about Kamala’s treatment. I am glad, however, that she will be in Dr. Bidhan’s capable hands, and he will have Sir Nilratan at his beck and call in case of emergency.
 Yours sincerely,

 SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, SABARMATI,libtech_408_footnote
 November 28, 1928
 MY DEAR SRINIVASAN,
 I have your letter. I do not propose to deal with it in the pages of Young India for I am sure no one else is likely to draw the deduction that you and your sister seem to have drawn from my writings. The whole of the case for a humanitarian ending of a creature’s life is based upon the assumption that whether belonging to the human species or a lower order if they had consciousness such a creature would not wish to live as I had assumed the calf would not in the circumstances in which it was placed and that there was no other service possible. In your sister’s case you and many others are at her beck and call and you all consider it, and that rightly, a privilege to render what service you can and relieve her pain be it ever so little. Her momentary wish to have her life put an end to was purely philanthropic out of regard for the convenience of her nurses. She was wrong in her reasoning. What she considered was an inconvenience to her nurses was a privilege, or should be, in the latter’s estimation. And if she desired death, the nurses could not comply with her desire, for that compliance would be tantamount to shirking of an obvious duty.
 The question of karma does not arise at all in either case. This has been repeatedly explained in the pages of Young India. If we were to bring in the law of karma in such matters, we would put an end to all effort. The working of the law of karma is an incessant, ever-going process; whereas you and your sister evidently assumed that certain actions were set in motion and that the motion in  that  straight  direction continued uninterrupted without the operation  of  any further actions coming into play. The fact indeed is that every activity in   nature  is  constantly   interfering   with  the   law  of   karma.  Such
 
 near me when I was reading your article on the killing of the Ashram calf. She said in an appealing tone, ‘Will you allow me to end my life?	’ She paused for a while,  and
 after some reconsideration said, ‘Oh, how can I escape from my karma? I cannot avoid  it; I can only postpone it by death. I suppose, then, Gandhiji is not right in killing the calf.’        May I request you to consider the matter in Young India as  I  believe that
 many others may share the same opinion” (S.N. 13729).
 
 interference is inherent in the law. For the law is not a dead, rigid, inert thing, but it is an ever-living, ever-growing mighty force.
 Yours sincerely

 DEAR LALA GIRDHARILAL ,
 I had your long telegram and now I have your long letter redirected to me from Sabarmati. It is for that reason perhaps that I miss The Tribune cutting which I have not yet seen. Lala Jagannath tells me he sent no telegram to The Tribune or any other paper. Without knowing the contents of the cutting it is difficult for me to say anything more.
 About the memorial you will have seen the appeallibtech_409_footnotesigned by Dr. Ansari, Pandit Malaviyaji and Sheth Ghanshyamdas Birla. I do not think that it is possible to support the Congress out of these funds. Nor should any appeal in the name of a great person be made on behalf of Provincial Congress. Each organization must really stand on its own merits and command the confidence of monied men in its own province. Anyway that is my firm conviction. I do not know what view the signatories will take of your proposal. It comes upon me as a surprise. The only way in which, in my opinion, these funds should be utilized is first to put Lalaji’s own creation—the Society—on a firm footing and support such political activities of his, which have an all-India character. There may be other provincial or sectional memorials, but even these can’t include the support of a growing and varied organization like a Provincial Congress Committee.

 I had your wire as also your letter. I have not been writing to you as I had no time. You will see from  Young Indialibtech_410_footnotelibtech_411_footnotethat I have noticed your telegram and made suitable comments upon it. Your telegram is excellent if it fulfils the condition I have laid down in my note in Young India. My caution was necessary because, if my recollection serves me right, in the communication that I had from you some months ago during Lalaji’s lifetime, you had represented yourself as the injured party. If you still have that sense of injury, your telegram is meaningless. What we want at this critical period in our history is not a mechanical unity, that is a superfluous thing, but a heart unity which can’t break under any strain.

 MY DEAR JAWAHAR,
 I have your letter. I shall be sorry indeed if you have to enter the Municipality again, unless you enter it on condition of perfect obedience being rendered to you. If you have to  go  in  for  the purpose of settling disputes, it is not worth while. My conviction is that you cannot combine all-India work with solid municipal work. Solid municipal work is a thing complete in itself and requires  all  the energy that a man can give it and I would not like your work to be anything but solid.
 I was to have gone to Mysore to attend the  Christian  Convention. That was the hope I had given to friends during the middle of the year, but I informed them about a month ago that my going was impossible, if I was to have any rest at all.
 The news you had given me about Kamala is bad. I like the idea of her being under treatment in Calcutta. She will have there the best medical advice possible.
I do hope that you will find time to attend the meeting here.

 CHI. KISHORELAL,
 I have shown your letter to Jamnalalji. He would prefer that you should join the Gandhi Seva Sangh. To me it is the same either way. You certainly have the right to draw money from the Ashram, but Jamnalalji thinks that if you come over to the (Gandhi Seva) Sangh, you will be of some help in shaping it. I see only one difficulty in this. If you join the Sangh you should attend the one or two meetings of the Sangh which take place every year. If your health can stand that strain, then there is no harm in joining. From this point of view, the decision will have to be yours. Do not think of any other difficulties. That is, if you can undertake a  little  travelling occasionally, do join the Sangh. Your activities there will continue as at present. It will mean that you will continue to belong to the Ashram, but will also, in addition, be a member of the Sangh. After I hear from you either by letter or wire I will write to Jamnalalji’s firm to arrange about the money.
Tara and Shanti are here at present. I met Nanabhai on the way.
I have asked him not even to come here. His health is bad indeed.

It 	was in 	the Partition 	agitation days that 	Lalaji was 	deported without trial by 	the Government 	and yet when he 	returned he 	resisted the 	overtures of 	the so-called 	extreme wing of 	the Congress 	politicians. He 	helped the Moderates headed by Phirozeshah and Gokhale. Though he 	was injured the most yet he turned the left cheek   to the nominal Christians who no more remember the virtues of their Master. . . .  Once 	more during the Non-co-operation movement he was sent to jail on a 	charge which could not bear the light of law and justice. But when 	he was discharged from jail he again helped his persecutors. He 	pleaded for entry into the Councils for what is called discriminate 	support.  . 	. . Well therefore might the British people weep, and weep they 	would were      
 they not dazzled and blinded by the pride of power.
 If even after the departure of such trusty Indian friends, tried and true, the Englishmen persist in their obstinacy, a time may come when the Indian generations to be will vow eternal enmity to England. It may even be the kind of enmity that Christians vowed and carried out through centuries against the Jews for the Christ who was crucified. It is quite possible that their domination may come to be viewed as    a crucifixion of a whole nation and might rouse the worst passions of the generations yet unborn. Let therefore the Empire take thought and take heed, make up while yet there is time for the night cometh when the die will have been cast and retreat and compromise will be out of the question.

356,,LALAJI MEMORIAL,"
      
 I invite the attention of readers to the appeal for five lakhs issued over the signatures of Dr. Ansari, Pandit Malaviyaji and Sjt. Ghanshyamdas Birla. Signatures have been purposely restricted to those only without whose signatures no memorial can be considered truly national. There was great difficulty in choosing other names. Nor was there time enough to consult all the parties whose names should appear, if some of them might. After all if the prestige of Lalaji’s name is not enough to induce the public to subscribe  liberally, no names however many or distinguished they may be are likely to fetch subscriptions. The only assurance therefore the public need have in respect of memorials such as this is that the appeal must be from those whose names are a guarantee of good faith and honest administration. The three signatories are more than ample guarantee of these essentials.
 I hope that the response will be quick and generous. It is to be wished that all those who have come under Lalaji’s benign influence will send in their mite. The Memorial will gain in weight for small subscriptions making up the total of five lakhs. If we can collect five lakhs from five lakhs men and women, this collection by itself will be substantial propaganda for swaraj. And if the minimum sum fixed by the signatories to the appeal is made up principally of small subscriptions, no pressure will be felt by anyone during these hard times. If monied men have a special duty in such matters, the others are not on that account absolved from their duty of contributing according to their ability.
 I suggest therefore to the various associations and societies that they make immediate collections from all on their rolls or under their influence. We have at least 27,00,000 students in high schools and
 colleges. They can always save from their pocket money enough to make a very substantial sum. Nor should the suppressed classes lag behind in tendering their quota.
 We often waste time and energy in debating and wrangling over a multitude of suggestions and rehearse many possible improvements. Let such critics remember that perfection is not possible in human undertakings. Let us therefore try to do well things even though we may think of better things so long as what is presented to us for acceptance is not open to any fatal objection and especially when it comes from tried and trusted leaders.
 Any subscriptions sent to the Young India office will be acknowledged in these columns.

357,,GOOD IF TRUE,"
      
 Dr. Satyapal sent me on 22nd November, 1928, the following telegram:
 Lala Lajpat Rai’s death causes irreparable loss to Punjab. I offer my most humble and affectionate salutations to the great departed leader at this deplorable and critical juncture. I on my behalf and of other friends who differed from Lalaji assure friends who were offended for differing from Lalaji that we hereby sink all differences and resolve starting with a clean slate. We bear no ill will, we have no prejudice and we offer our hearty co-operation in all political movements started by Lalaji and we place ourselves unreservedly at the disposal of such friends. We offer hearty invitation to all these friends who have remained away from the Congress to join hands with us vigorously to pursue the campaign of swaraj, for which Lalaji lived and died. Henceforth in sacred memory of Lalaji we resolve to present a united front, even if it be possible by our complete surrender.
 It reflects great credit upon its authors, if the sentiments expressed in the telegram are heartfelt. I am obliged to utter this note of warning because I have known so many such deathbed repentances that one is never sure whether they are heartfelt or whether they are due to the impulse of the moment, or what is worse, outward pressure.  The authors will never be able to bury the hatchet if inside their hearts they feel that their opposition to Lalaji was justified and warranted by circumstances and dictated by no selfish consideration or other unworthy motives but by the purest patriotism. If such was the case there would be no cause for repentance. One can only be just to the memory of a dead man, one cannot wipe from one’s memory the wrong he might have really done. Repentance presupposes conviction
 of one’s own error. If then the authors feel that on the whole they wronged Lalaji in his lifetime or that the motive for their opposition was mixed then the repentance is genuine and should last. Subject to this reservation, I tender my congratulations to Dr. Satyapal and his companions on  this  patriotic  message  and  hope  that  there would be  a  strong,  sustained  and  united  effort  in  the  Punjab  to  carry   on the mission bequeathed by Lalaji. In many respects it is possible for the Punjab to give the lead to the whole of India, if only the Punjab wills it, and if party feeling and communalism disappear in that land of five rivers. If the Punjab Press, instead of indulging in vituperation and innuendoes as a portion of it does, will but educate public opinion along right lines, I have no doubt that the rest of India will follow. Nothing can be a greater monument to the memory of Lalaji than that the Punjab should lead all India along the right path.

358,,‘A BLOT ON BOMBAY’,"
      
 Shri Nagindas Amulakhrai of Ghatkopar Sarvajanik Jivadaya Khatun has sent to the President, Municipal Corporation, the following reasoned letter on the question of milk supply to Bombay:libtech_421_footnote
 Bombay has been called Bombay the beautiful. If Bombay means merely Malabar Hill and Chowpati and beauty is to be referred only to the exterior, then Bombay is certainly beautiful. But if the heart of Bombay is penetrated, like most of our cities it is ugly both in appearance and reality. The indifference of city fathers to the milk supply of their city is truly criminal and the facts carefully compiled in the foregoing letter do constitute a “blot” on Bombay  the  beautiful. But it seems to me to be useless merely to blame the members of the Municipality. They are after all what the voters make them. If Bombay is to have a cheap supply of pure milk the education of the voters should be undertaken on a wide scale. They should be taught never to vote for any candidate who does not pledge himself to secure a proper milk supply for the city in the quickest possible time. In the language of Blatchford milk should be treated like postage stamps. It should not be left to private enterprise but should be the first care of every municipality.

359,,HAND-SPINNING IN MYSORE,"
      
 No State in India has so systematically encouraged hand- spinning as the State of Mysore. I have before me a copy of the note prepared by Sjt. G. Ranganatha Rao Sahib, the Director of Industries in Mysore, for submission to the State Sub-committee “constituted to consider the question of hand-spinning,” I give the notelibtech_422_footnotebelow in full:
 I congratulate the Director and the Sub-committee on the thoroughness with which they are handling this very important national supplementary cottage industry. Naturally the Director is cautious in his note. Equally naturally every step taken in organizing hand-spinning is being taken with deliberation and due thought. The result is that even from the very commencement the Department has been able to avoid loss on capital. The Department did not disdain to profit by the labours of the All-India Spinners’ Association or to accept the technical assistance offered by it. It is quite clear from the report that the field to be covered by the wheel is vast enough to engage the attention of many workers in the field. I hope that the experiments that are being carried on to perfect a village carding machine will succeed. The machine to be of value will have to be such as to be capable of being worked by the villagers. My own humble opinion is that it is not possible to improve upon the carding-bow now in use in our villages. The Technical Department of the All-India Spinners’ Association tried to introduce small changes in the original bow, but the foundation seems to be incapable of alteration, if we bear in mind the purpose for which the bow is intended. What is more, if the cotton to be carded is good, well-picked and well-cleaned, carding with the bow becomes an incredibly easy, simple and quick process and capable of being undertaken by even delicately built men and women. And my own experience is that no more than five minutes need be given to carding and sliver-making for an hour’s spinning of thirty counts. Half a tola of thirty counts gives 320 yards, fine average speed for a good spinner. To card half a tola of cotton will not  require more than five minutes for a tolerably good carder. And if the thousand spinners whom the Director mentions could be coaxed to learn carding, they could prepare their own slivers and add a little more to their earning per hour, because it will be possible to give spinners who are their own carders a little more wage than to those who spin with slivers prepared for them.
 
 Whilst tendering my congratulations to the Mysore State upon its zeal on behalf of the poorest raiyats, I venture to remind the well-to-do citizens of Mysore and also the officials that khadi will not find an abiding place in the homes of the people of Mysore unless these two classes adopt khadi for their own wear. They now know that it is possible to get as fine khadi as they wish to possess. Let them not confuse the minds of the unsophisticated villagers by leading them to think that the so-called higher classes are not prepared to practise what they preach. Let them remember the words of the Bhagavad Gita:
 The simple folk imitate the action (not the speech) of excellent men.libtech_423_footnote

From 	a microfilm: S.N. 13743           SATYAGRAHA 	ASHRAM, WARDHA,  November29, 1928  	I have your cable redirected to me from Sabarmati. It was received 	on the 26th. At first I found it difficult to understand it. I 	thought you did not know anything about Lalaji’s death. But then I 	saw that you had alarming telegrams about Lalaji’s death being due 	to the injuries received. My own opinion is that the physical injury 	was not serious, though, having been received in the region of the 	heart, it might have proved fatal. And the injuries would have  been 	very serious had it not been for the intervention of friends who 	surrounded him bravely and received the blows themselves. But there 	is no doubt that Lalaji received a nervous shock from which he never 	completely recovered. All his writings, all his speeches after the 	incident are eloquent proof of my statement. Government’s 	indifference and elaborate statement summarily dismissing Lalaji’s 	challenge ignoring even Lalaji’s name added fuel to the fire that 	was raging in his breast. He did not feel so much the personal wrong 	as the wrong  done through him to the whole nation. The prostration 	of the people made the insult all the more galling. You will see in 	the pages of Young India the appeal issued for a 	national Memorial for Lalaji. Sheth Ghanshyamdas Birla has started 	it with a handsome donation of Rs. 15,000. I am hoping that the 	appeal will meet with generous response.  	I am in Wardha at least up to the 20th December. I shall have to 
 be in Calcutta for a few days. Then I want to go back to Sabarmati. I have not the courage yet to bury myself there. Somehow or other I feel that I must go out for a while and then there is the often postponed European visit. If you have altered your views and think that I should not visit Europe, you will cable so. Your  negative decision would be final for me. If you mean yes, you need not cable, because there may be many things in spite of my wish to go to  Europe that may prevent me. The going therefore will take its own course.
 I enclose herewith copy of a letter received from the Macmillan Company. Having got the copyright, they evidently want the pound of flesh. I wish I had not entered into this. I entered into it because of Rev. Holmes. But it is all right. Perhaps they will give the permission to you. I shouldn’t mind if they would only publish the Autobio- graphy in volumes. I have no notion when the whole thing will be finished, even though I am omitting many important events and trying to hurry on to the Non-co-operation days. I want to break off after the Special Session at Calcutta, because the events are too fresh and there are so many contemporaries whom I must describe, if I am to write further. I feel too that it would be advisable for me to stop at that stage for thenceforward my life has been too public. Therefore there is no need for further elucidation. And then of course there is Young India, a clear mirror through which anybody who cares can look at me.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
I have your letter.
 If the meaning you read in ‘win over Narandas’libtech_427_footnoteis correct, I admit that it should hurt you. But you should never have read that meaning in the remark. How can you know the context in which it was made? It was in continuation of a conversation with Chhaganlal. It is plain that there are reserves between you two. Chhaganlal is the Secretary. He knows his weakness, and I know it too. If at all, I should advise him. The remark ‘win over Narandas’ was intended to suggest to him that it was his duty to try to understand you, to listen to your point of view and to accommodate himself to you. It does not imply any defect in you. If I had wished to imply any defect in you, I would not have said ‘win over’. Instead, I would have said ‘reform Narandas through love’, or something to that effect, and I would also have first drawn your attention to your defect. I have observed no such defect in you and, therefore, there was no question of my drawing your attention to it. I certainly do not wish that you should remain silent or should not draw attention to any errors you may observe. If you fail to draw attention to them, I would blame you for that. Do you understand my meaning now? Please let me know if there is any other point which requires to be clarified. You can show this letter to Chhaganlal. I think it would be better if you do so. But I leave it to you to decide whether or not you should.
 I wish to make a few inquiries about Chalalalibtech_428_footnote. I shall, therefore, write about it afterwards.

 I am sure you have sent the accompanying  papers  to  me through some mistake. I often receive papers like these which need not have been sent to me.
 In your letter you make no suggestion concerning Shankerlal’s letter. Should I get another resolution passed here?
 I will inquire a little further into the Chalala affair and then write to you. I return with this the letters of . . . behnlibtech_431_footnoteand  .  .  .lallibtech_432_footnote. It is certainly a painful chapter.
 The reason why Mahavir, Durga and Maitri fall ill frequently is nothing but their food.
 I wanted to write to you about myself when I had leisure. There is no trace of impatience in the experiments I am making. It was all along my intention to experiment with the use of oil after coming here. I had not been taking fruit even when I was there. Even then I ate nothing but fruits during the journey. Here, too, I do not exclude fruits altogether.
 Today being Lalaji Day, and for other reasons, I have eaten only fruits. The only material difference is that I take no milk.
 I naturally feel sometimes that I should compete with all of you. But you have no reason to feel worried about this. No one here feels worried. Everyone knows that I will attempt nothing beyond my strength. It is many years since I overcame the attachment to life; this is not a new thing.
 It is enough that you keep on striving. You should never worry that you will not be able to attain the level which you say I have done. It is easy enough to attain that level; in any matter in which you find it difficult to do so, put yourself in God’s hand. If you stop worrying, your efforts will succeed better. If you lack fitness for anything, you will acquire it by patiently striving for it. If even after this, you have any questions to ask me, ask them.

Since you have succeeded in obtaining cow’s ghee, I now wish to 	take no hasty step.  	On a day such as Lalaji Memorial Day, may we not reckon the wages  	for  all  forms  of  labour  at  the  same  rate?  It  would   be 	better to apply this rule to items where it can be easily applied. 	For that purpose, a register such as I have suggested should be 	maintained. That is, the wage per hour should be fixed at one or 	three-quarters of an anna, and the register should show the quantum 	of work per hour for each kind of labour. For instance, for spinning 	300 yards per hour, or any other figure that you may fix, and 	similarly for grinding grain, weaving, digging, cleaning grain, 	cleaning land, weaving  Patilibtech_436_footnotelibtech_437_footnote, carpentry, etc., calculation would become easy if we 	had such a table. Everyone maintains a diary, so that we can count 	up the value of everyone’s work for our information. My point is 	that, if we accept the principle I have suggested, we can thus 	scientifically examine its working.  	I have been thinking about Krishnamaiyadevi. You will have to play a 	prominent part in this matter. You should speak to her if she shirks 	work or does anything improper.  	It is necessary that you should write to me about what you hear 	concerning Shardabehn. Sometimes the stories we hear are false. What 	is the nature of Gangabehn’s discontent?  	I like the idea that one day in the week everyone should work for a 	fixed number of hours. There should be no dirt anywhere in the 	[Udyoga] Mandir. I 	shall have a talk with Mirabehn. The issues of “Mandir     
 Samachar” for both the weeks have been got up so badly that it is impossible to read them.
 I see no harm in drawing Shamalbhai’s expenses either from the Mandir or from the Vidyapith. Kaka may do what will give him better peace of mind. I believe Kaka cannot join in the experiment of living within Rs. 12 [a month]. For one thing, he is not an expert in experimenting with his body so that he can take any kind of liberty with it.
 There is no letter from Bal. I was taken aback to learn what he had demanded. I was ready to be told that he had asked for something more than Rs. 12, but not as much as Rs. 20. You need not hurt him. I shall thrash out the point with him.
 I understand what kind of an agreement we should have with the Spinners’ Association. I shall now write to Shankerlal. You need not worry on this account. You are also doing right in collecting opinions. Think about all aspects objectively.
 Cultivate such health that you should never catch cold or any such infection.

If you become an expert in that work, you will be able to do the highest service both to the world and to human beings. Our men of dharma have taken no interest in this field at all, for modern Hindu society has committed the great sin of regarding that work as, from its very nature, tainted with adharma. We should atone for this sin by infusing the spirit of dharma in that work. I have been discussing the problem of cow-protection with some rich persons here. These discussions also lead me to the same conclusion. Give me from time to time a detailed description of your experiences there, so that I may gradually get the complete picture.

 November  29, 1928
 
DEAR APPA,
 You have raised a good question about the calf. We have of course to give up the fear of death as also of pain. This is true for oneself, but it cannot be applied to others. Our duty is ourselves to shed fear of death and other pains and help others when they are in pain. Thus, on the one hand we have to shed the fear of pain and on the other to follow the dharma of compassion, of relieving others of their pain. The same about death. Some pains can be relieved only through death. If we wish to shed the fear or death, we should have no hesitation in seeking or giving relief from pain through death. At any rate we should not consider it a sin. Why should we have hesitation in hastening the moment of death—that is, where the motive is to help?
 Thereby we are not violating any law of nature. . .libtech_438_footnoteEverybody who is born is sure to die. We are only changing the moment . . . libtech_439_footnote
 It was necessary to turn the calf on its side and I wanted to do so too. But it was impossible without giving it more pain. So it was impossible to act on the wish. In the case of a child it is always possible to carry out such a wish. If you still do not follow my point, ask me again. Let me know if you do not receive the money from the Charkha Sangh.

           November 	29, 1928  	Our scriptures tell us that childhood, old age and death are 	incident only to this perishable body of ours and that man’s 	spirit is eternal and immortal. That being so, why should we fear 	death? And where there is no fear of death there can be no sorrow 	over it either. It does not therefore behove us to shed tears over 	Lalaji’s passing away but to emulate and copy his virtues. The 	central feature of his character was his burning passion for service 	of the motherland and he began his career with the service of the 	most downtrodden of his countrymen, viz., the so-called 	untouchables, whilst he was still a youth. It may not be given to 	everybody to emulate his career in the Assembly which was but a 	small incident in his career, but all can develop the spirit of 	sacrifice which ran like a continuous thread through his life.

 DEAR BROTHER,"
373,"November 30, 1928",LETTER TO SHAUKAT ALI,"
      
 SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, WARDHA,
 November 30, 1928
  	I have your letter. I had your speech at Cawnpore read to me. I do 	not see substantial difference between the Associated Press report 	and the reportlibtech_441_footnotelibtech_442_footnoteyou have sent me. All the terrible threats and still 	more terrible exaggerations that are in the English report are to be 	found in the Urdu report. The slavery of the Hindus, the digging out 	of eyes, the challenge, the unequivocal indictment against the 	Hindus are all there in their nakedness. If you can spare the time, 	I would like you to read the cutting that I sent you, or if you have 	destroyed  it,  get another copy, and you will see almost every 	sentence  of  English report in the report you have sent me. And 	tell me if you will still call the speaker as per English report “a 	cad and a  very  crude performer”, and, if you will do so, I would 	like you to tell me why and show me the difference between the 	English report and the Urdu in my possession.  	No, the speaker at Cawnpore is not the Maulana with whom I have been 	so long familiar and with whom I have passed so many happy days as 	with a blood-brother and bosom friend. The Maulana of Cawnpore is an 	utter stranger to me. The Maulana I have known vowed that he was so 	bound to the Hindu for his help during the Khilafat agitation that 	he would put up with him, even if he ravished his sister, that so 	far as he and the Mussalmans under his influence were concerned, he 	was out to suffer at the hands of the Hindus who had done so well. 	Well, I do not ask him to suffer to the extent that he promised; but 	I do plead with him on bended knees to revise his Cawnpore speech, 	admit: that he was out of sorts and bravely apologize to his Hindu 	brother for wounding his feelings as the Cawnpore speech undoubtedly 	does. If the Hindu has been a slave of old, you are co-sharer in his 	slavery by ties of blood, by acceptance of indissoluble partnership. 	You chose in 1920 to be co-sharer with the Hindu in his virtues as 	well as his vices for eternity, in his strength as well as his 	weakness.  	I would go all the way with you in accusing the Hindu of his many 	misdeeds; but I am unable to hold with you that he has been ever the 	aggressor, ever the tyrant and his Mussalman brother always the 	injured victim. If I had at all felt like that, you would have found 	me proclaiming it from the house top. But I am not going into a    
 controversy with you. I simply want to tell you that, in my opinion, all your incitement is wrong, your judgment is one-sided and that the Mussalman is at least equally guilty with the Hindu, if not on the whole more so. Assuming that you will impute honesty of motive and statement to me, I would ask you to make room for doubt as to the correctness of your judgment. In your Cawnpore speech you are too terribly dogmatic and emphatic. The assumption of infallibility is unworthy of you. I ask you to disown it for friendship’s sake.
 One personal thing, I must correct. The Khilafat Committee did pay for a time for my expenses at your instance, not on my request, and certainly not for the reason that you state, for the simple reason that I have never travelled at Congress expense on any single occasion, even when I have done exclusively Congress work. My travelling expenses have always been borne by friends. And when I accepted your offer, I had Rs. 25,000 placed at my disposal by a common friend, whom you know, purely for my travelling as he was most anxious that I should never stint myself about these, nor draw upon any public funds for them. I had given you this information, but I agreed with you that it would be more graceful if I let you pay my travelling expenses. But in the manner in which you now put the matter, I feel inclined to offer to return the whole of these expenses with interest if you will accept them without being insulted or  offended. I think that Mahadev will have somewhere a record of these expenses.
 Let me also correct another grave error. The Tilak Swaraj Fund is a matter of audited record. Every pie received is accounted for in the printed accounts which have been before the public now for years. You will perhaps be painfully surprised to discover that let alone 20 lacs there are not even two lacs received from Mussalmans for the Tilak Swaraj Fund. I do not make a grievance of this, but I want you to hold truth as a sacred thing. And if you want me to produce the handsome figures of Hindus who have paid to the Khilafat coffers I shall gladly do so and perhaps it would be another surprise for you. I wish you could recall those stirring days of our joint peregrination from shop to shop where Hindus vied with one another to pay even to the Khilafat Fund as to the Tilak Swaraj Fund. Do you want me to furnish you with a sample list? If am erring, I would like you to correct me not by a counter assertion but by figures. But if you have none, I want you to tender an apology not to me, not to the public, but to God for having been betrayed into a hasty but painful error.
 I had the report of your version of the Cowasji Jehangir Hall meeting read to me. The conduct of the audience was disgraceful beyond words. I have always held this imitation of the West as a
 degraded and degrading thing unworthy of us.  This  wretched imitation may yet prove our undoing. You were entitled to a respectful hearing. Above all at a condolence meeting such conduct was criminal. In spite of what I consider to be a temporary aberration on your part the meeting should have remembered your many and brilliant services to the Motherland. But here my agreement with you ends. I refuse to endorse the deduction that you have drawn in favour of your theory of universal condemnation of Hindus. A purely Mussalman audience has been known before now to behave no better. The conduct of the meeting in question was symptomatic  not  of Hindu mentality but of the present mentality of city Indians. You and I, Mussalmans and Hindus, have to club together to eradicate this growing evil from our midst and no to fling mud against one another. Just as you remained unmoved in the meeting so should you have remained unmoved when you reached home and found  yourself surrounded by friends. You should have laughed at the incident as I have so often generously seen you laugh at such incidents and forgive contrary to my wish what you have called the pardonable indiscretions of exuberant youths. Have you not said so often, let them do so, they have been too long under slavery?
 I have done. Personally if you are still your old self, I have no anxiety to see our correspondence in print.libtech_443_footnotelibtech_444_footnoteBut  if  you   think,  that there is nothing left for you but war to the knife, by all means publish the correspondence. But if you are still the old gentle brother that I have known you to be, then read this letter again and again if the first reading does not satisfy you. Read it with Mahomed Ali. I am in no hurry. Then lay aside all other work and both of you come down to Wardha, you with a determination still to hold me in your pocket. You will find me easy enough to carry. I am fast losing weight. But if after mature joint deliberation you cannot take any such heroic step, then publish this correspondence and spare me the painful necessity of having to make some statement to the public. And believe that,  whether you feel my presence in your pocket or not, I am there. My unchangeable creed is non-violence and universal brotherhood. Therefore I repeat what I have said from a thousand platforms that mine is a unilateral partnership and therefore my partnership with you and the other Mussalmans is indissoluble. Though they may disown me a million times, I shall still be theirs when occasion demands it. May God help so that I am not found wanting.
I appreciate your decision about All-India Spinners’ Associa-
 
 tion. I won’t misunderstand it. Your decision is right and your resignation will be accepted. But I would expect you to come back to the Association when you feel that spinning is part of your duty not only as a nationalist but also as a Mussalman, that you owe it to the millions of your countrymen not merely because you are an Indian but equally because you are a Mussalman, that is, if my reading of Islam is correct.
 Yours sincerely,

 Friday [November 30, 1928]
 BHAISHRI CHHAGANLAL,
I had no letter from you today.
 I have thought about the Chalala matter. For the present, let the work go ahead according to the budget prepared by Jaisukhlal. I mean by this that you should make the required sums available from the balance in the khadi account. These sums should be debited in the Chalala account and should be recovered from the proceeds of the sale of Amreli khadi lying with us. We would not have to pay anything if all that stock could be sold off immediately. All that I have to decide, therefore, is this: how to help Chalala so that it would not matter if it incurred a loss up to Rs. 800 during the next year. The loss should be met from the profit from Amreli khadi and not by raising the price of Chalala khadi. If you are required to undertake responsibility for anything more than this, let me know.
 If you require Shripatrao’s help in the Ashram, by all means ask him for it.
 The inmates of the Ashram here did physical labour yesterdaylibtech_445_footnoteto be able to contribute something to the Lalaji Memorial Fund and have decided to give up eating jaggery for a week from today. They were served gruel every morning containing three tolas of jaggery per head. Instead of jaggery, salt is being added now.

 November 30, 1928
  	I have had a letter from you after a long time. I can forgive you 	everything. Certainly you need not spin nor keep a diary. I 	certainly observe a difference of temper between us but what does 	that matter? How can I expect that you should look at everything 	through my eyes, or that your eyes and mine should be alike? I may 	not give up the spinning-wheel, because I have come to regard 	spinning as a form of yajna. There are other items in our 	daily programme of work, and I see their results from day to day. It 	gives me pleasure to see them. The results of the spinning-wheel 	yajna are a matter of faith. Has anyone observed personally 	that our spinning ends the poverty of the poor? But my faith tells 	me that it does, and so I keep apart some time for the yajna from 	the other tasks of our daily programme. If I did not do so, I would 	regard myself guilty of the sin of theft.  	About the diary, there is another reason. I keep it because it is 	part of the discipline of the Ashram, or to be correct, of the 	[Udyoga] Mandir, to do so. A diary may not be necessary for me, but 	it is so for others and, therefore, I would not confuse their minds 	by not keeping one myself.  	If anything in the rule which I follow with regard to Santok is not 	clear to you, please bear with it to that extent. The problem has 	perplexed me very much indeed.  	I do not suffer any hardships. The atmosphere here is very congenial 	for the work I am doing. I will certainly not do anything at the 	cost of my health. Do not jump to conclusions from any rumours you 	may hear. If you have any apprehensions, write to me. If I had time, 	I would myself write to you about everything. I am not deter- mined 	to continue at any cost the experiments in which I am currently 	engaged. The only change I have made is giving up of milk once 	again. Give it up, and resume it again—this will go on, like ebb 	and flow alternating with each other, for, as you know, I am not at 	all happy that I take milk.  	I have not received a specimen of the diary. Ghanshyamdas is still 	here, as also Jagannathji. There are daily additions to the other 	company. Tell 	Ramdas that he should write once in a while.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 You must have received the letter I wrote to you yesterday. Can we not supply every month ten to twenty pounds of yarn of between 30 and 40 counts to those women in Poona who want fine yarn? We should feel ashamed if we cannot. If we cannot obtain the quality from anywhere, why cannot we spin fine yarn of that quality in the Ashram? Do not all of us spin one tola of yarn every day? Everyone should spin fine yarn and sell that quantity. If necessary, we may supply cotton to all.
 In the yarn I spin at present I easily attain a count of 30. To make one tola of 30 counts, we should have 480 (lengths of thread). I see, therefore, that we may not be able to maintain that average. But cannot we maintain an average of one half tola? The cotton which I spin is grown locally from American seed. I am collecting more information about it.
 I enclose a letter from Mirabehn for your information. We  should not mind her anger, but should appreciate  her  sincere criticism. There is no limit to her frankness of heart. She is arriving here today.

380,,LETTER TO PRABHUDAS GANDHI,"
      
 
 
ASHRAM,
     CHI. 	PRABHUDAS,  [After November 1928]libtech_447_footnote 
  	I got your letter of 26th August. The reason why I got it so late is 	that it came into my hands after it had wandered among others who 	read it first one after another. One naturally forgets about a 	letter which has not been filed. That is what happened in the case 	of your letter. And once it is filed, it comes into one’s hand 	when its turn comes. However I take it that the delay has caused no 	inconvenience to you.  	As long as you keep yourself within the amount sanctioned by the 	Managing Board for the expense, you should continue to carry on that 	same activity in the manner you think fit. I am of the opinion that 	you do not need the Board’s legal consent for that. Even so, I 	will place your letter before the Board. However, if you can 	immediately proceed to Bageshwar, you should do so. I see no 	difficulty in your doing so. Do not do anything in haste.  	If necessary, you may lend upto Rs. 200 for completing the 	construction of the building. Keep in mind the idea of buying some 	land in Bijoria as a branch of the Ashram and putting up buildings 	on it, but first test it on the anvil of experience and determine 	whether it is sound or unsound. You will be able to decide more 	easily after you have settled down at Bageshwar and, if you remain 	firm in that idea, I will consider it and have it considered by 	others also. I will of course not worry about your health, but at 	the same time, I will be apprehensive that you might not steadily 	cling to your work. You can remove that fear only by convincing me 	by your conduct. However, do not sacrifice your health by being over 	enthusiastic for, if you do so, it will harm your work and we should 	regard that consideration as more important than the question of 	your health. The point is that one should look upon one’s health 	as a trust and take as much care of it as possible. You have done 	well to tell me in your letter that the cow is being neglected for 	the sake of the pine-tree gum. I will have to think over it. You, on 	your part, should forget about such things after you have passed 	them on to me and, regarding them beyond your field of    
 work, not let them weigh on your mind. God has not given the necessary strength to any individual or organization to fight all injustice. If He were to do so, He would Himself have produced His rival. We should believe that He is not so stupid as all that and dance in our own circle.
 One more storm is raging in the Ashram these days. But it is through such storms that it is purified. I am therefore calm. I do not have the time to give you a description of it. You may read something about it in the Ashram magazine. The rest you will know from what Chhaganlal or Kashi might be writing to you.

381,,A GOOD BEGINNINGlibtech_448_footnote,"
      
 Subscriptions for the Lalaji Memorial have begun well with Sjt. Ghanshyamdas Birla heading the list with Rs. 15,000 at Wardha. The fact that a strong provincial committee has been formed in the Punjab and  had  at  the  time  (lst   instant)   of   writing   this   already   had Rs. 25,000 on their list also augurs well. I wish all the provinces will follow suit and fix their own minimum and set about collecting that sum. Whilst I suggested a method of finding one’s quota on the basis of population, it was obviously not intended to apply to those provinces, districts or cities which could bear a far larger proportion. It would be ridiculous for instance for Bombay to fling at  the  treasurer of the Fund its quota on the basis of population. Its quota can only be fixed according to its world-wide name and fame. Unfortunately we have in our country terrible contrasts. There are the submerged not tenth but fifth who are living in semi-starvation and who can therefore give nothing. Their burden has to be shouldered by the cities and the other prosperous areas.
 The rapidity with which the subscriptions for the Memorial are collected will be a measure of people’s earnestness about preserving the memory of the Lion of the Punjab whose roar we shall hear no more. But let us remember that even twice the amount asked by the distinguished signatories to the appeal will not meet the requirements of the present day. Evidence is daily gathering round us that if we are to vindicate national honour which was stabbed when Lalaji was so brutally assaulted, we have to devise some means of hastening the
 
 advent of swaraj. One such means and the mildest is to finish the work that Lalaji was doing. He had undertaken to popularize the Nehru Report. Surely an effort in this direction is worth making and is quite feasible. To secure unanimity of approval for the Report is but a step in the national march. By itself it will not give even dominion status. But we shall surely need unanimity about some demand of ours  before we devise common action to enforce the demand.
 In my humble opinion any discussion on the respective merits of dominion status and unadulterated independence is irrelevant to our present purpose. Everybody seems to agree that if  we  get dominion status it would be a long step in the direction we want to go. But the independence group seem to argue that it is certain that we are never going to get dominion status and that since dominion status is not our final goal, why waste national energy on a fruitless errand and why not straightaway work for independence pure and simple? There would be considerable force in the argument if the attainment of dominion status was an impossibility and if unanimity on indepen- dence was possible. As it is, if we can take action for independence with a fair chance of success, the same action plus unanimity which the Nehru Report has made possible on the issue of dominion status should surely make its attainment more possible than that of indepen- dence. All therefore I plead for is not cessation of independence propaganda on the part of those who are enamoured of the enchanting formula but whole-hearted support for dominion status even as a stage in their progress. I claim that the two are in no way incompatible provided of course dominion status for India does not mean something quite different from what it means for South Africa or Canada. Memory of Lalaji and reason then demand consolidation of public opinion on the Nehru Report, and that now. For let it be borne in mind that that report is not a permanent or final document. It is a compromise the best attainable which representatives of most parties have endorsed. If public opinion cannot be now focussed upon it, all the effort spent upon it will be reduced to nought and the great document will be out of date and out of place. Its value depends purely upon its immediate acceptance by all the great national organizations.

386,,“A YOUNG HEART”libtech_451_footnote,"
           	A correspondent who signs himself “A young heart” has addressed 	me a long letter dealing with a number of subjects. This anxiety to 	keep the writer’s name secret betrays cowardice or lack of moral 	courage, alas, fast becoming but too common amongst us. It ill 	becomes those who aspire after swaraj. I would appeal to our young 	men to shed this moral weakness and speak out their thoughts with 	courage and yet with humility and restraint. Even if they cannot be 	sure of their sense of discrimination and courtesy, let them express 	their thoughts in the language that comes to them naturally. 	Cowardly silence will not only not teach them discrimination or 	courtesy but it will demoralize them into the bargain.  REGARDING 	THE CALF  	To come now to the questions adverted to by “A young heart” in 	his letter: The first one is about the yet unfinished calf episode. 	After observing that it was a grievous error on my part to have 	killed that calf, he goes on to give his arguments which I will skip 	over as they have already been answered in Navajivan. He then 	sums up:  In 	short if 	the poor 	calf had the tongue 	to speak 	it would 	certainly have implored 	you to 	spare it 	the poison 	injection and let it 	die a 	natural death after 	drawing    its 	   allotted    number 	   of    breaths.    It 	   seems     to     me    that 	in  an  excess 	 of  pity 	  for   the   suffering   	animal   you 	  betrayed   yourself 	into a 	great error and 	soiled your pure hands 	with the blood 	of aninnocent 	calf. I am 	sure that on 	further reflection 	the truth of my 	observation and 	the magnitude 	of your 	mistake will 	become clear as 	daylight to 	you. It 	would be 	improper to 	say anything more to 	one like you 	who has seen truth face 	to face, 	still I 	cannot help 	adding that 	in case you ever discover 	your error and according to your nature confess it to the world, the world would feel grateful     
 to you and further misunderstanding on the subject would be prevented. As it is, your action is bound to be misinterpreted and the sin of it all will be on your head. The sooner, therefore, you confess your error the better it would be for you and the world. May God vouchsafe to us all light and understanding!
 Let me hasten to tell this writer and all those who think like him that I am not in a position to avail myself of their advice. But this much I can promise that the moment I discover that I was wrong I will in all humility confess the wrong and also make for it all the amends possible. Let me also admit that my error, if an error it is found to be in the long run, would be deemed to be no light one as I shall in that event have been guilty of committing an irreligious act—be it in ignorance—in the name of religion. Such a thing would be reprehensible in anybody; in me not the least. For I know that for good or for evil, my conduct is likely to influence many. I have thus a full sense of my responsibility.
 But whilst I have not the slightest desire to minimize my responsibility in the matter, I believe that if in spite of the best of intentions one is led into committing mistakes, they do not really result in harm to the world or, for the matter of that, any individual. God always saves the world from the consequences of unintended errors of men who live in fear of Him. Those who are likely to be misled by my example would have gone that way all the same even if they had not known of my action. For in the final analysis a man is guided in his conduct by his own inner promptings, though the example of others might sometimes seem to guide him. But be it as it may, I know that the world has never had to suffer on account of my errors because they were all due to my ignorance. It is my firm belief that not one of my known errors was wilful. Indeed what may appear to be an obvious error to one may appear to another as pure wisdom. He cannot help himself even if he is under a hallucination. Truly has Tulsidas said:
 Even though there never is silver in mother-o’pearl nor water in the sunbeams, while the illusion of silver in the shining shell or that of water in the beams lasts, no power on earth can shake the deluded man free from the spell.
 Even so must it be with men like me who, it may be,  are labouring under a great hallucination. Surely, God will pardon them and the world should bear with them. Truth will assert itself in the end.
 REGARDING THE MONKEYS
 The other question touched by “A young heart” in his letter is regarding the monkeys. He writes:
 All that I wish to write regarding the monkeys is that you will, pray, not entertain the idea of killing them even in a dream. If they threaten your crops you may adopt such measures for keeping them from mischief as other farmers do, as for instance pelting them with stones, shouting, etc., but for heaven’s sake do not recommend their killing for a paltry few measures of grain. It would be wanton selfishness to compass such destruction for  a trifling gain. There cannot be two opinions in this matter: Hindus will always regard your action as himsa pure and simple. It is only on such occasions that one’s ahimsa is put to the test. Is it not monstrous to deprive a fellow-creature of life for the sake of a miserable little crop? What selfishness and what cruelty! How can such an iniquitous suggestion proceed from your lips at all? Well, you may by your superior brute force kill the monkeys but remember you will have to pay the price for it one day, and before the Great White Throne all your subtle arguments will avail you nothing. In the name of mercy, therefore,   I humbly beseech you not to besmirch your hands by such cruel deeds.
 That this question should be put to me in this way at this late hour of the day surprises me. I have already admitted that there would be violence in killing the monkeys. But what these professors  of ahimsa do not seem to realize is that even so there is himsa in stoning or otherwise torturing them. By restricting the meaning of ahimsa to non-killing we make room for nameless cruelties in this country and bring the fair name of ahimsa into disrepute and if we continue like this we shall as a nation soon forfeit our proud title as specialists in ahimsa. What I want is not only to be saved from killing the monkeys but from stoning or otherwise hurting them as well. That is why I have invited suggestions from such readers of this journal as believe in ahimsa. But instead of helping me, most readers have responded only by bombarding me with angry criticisms without even troubling to read my articles, much less to understand them; and even “A young heart” has not been able to avoid this pitfall. I can understand an honest difference of opinion, but what can be the use of advice based on assumptions not in the least warranted by my writings?
 THE HINDU-MUSLIM QUESTION
 The third question adverted to by “A young heart” is that of Hindu-Muslim unity. I cull the following sentences from his observations:
 Thinking that your efforts at establishing Hindu-Muslim unity have proved fruitless you are sitting with your lips almost sealed in this matter. That does not seem to me to be right. You may keep your silence on the question of unity, but do not you think that it is your duty to ascertain facts whenever there is a communal disturbance and after full consideration to express your opinion on merits? You may not take an active part but how will
 
 it injure the interests of the country if after giving an impartial hearing to both the sides you frankly speak to whomsoever might appear guilty in your eyes? The attitude that you have taken up with regard to the Godhra riot and Surat is, to be frank, hardly proper. Where is your valour gone now which you displayed abundantly on other occasions by calling a spade a spade? Good God! I am really surprised at this attitude of yours. I humbly ask you to advise the Hindus, if they cannot observe ahimsa as defined by you, to fight, in self-defence, those who assault or murder them and their dear ones without cause.
 I have already explained my position in this matter. I trust it is not out of fear that I do not air my views on this subject nowadays. But when it may be out of place for me to write or when I have not sufficient material to form an opinion or when the matter does not fall within my province, I consider it to be my duty to maintain silence. At present neither of the two parties is prepared to accept my solution of the Hindu-Muslim problem. There is therefore no occasion for me to express my opinion.
 There remains the question of expressing opinion on the riots that have taken place or might take place in the future. When the subject itself, as I have already pointed out, has gone out of my province, there can be no question of my expressing an opinion on events that may arise. Again, if I proceed to express opinion on such matters before scrutinizing what both the parties might have to say on them, my conduct would be justly held to be improper and even impertinent. There would also be the danger of my misjudging. And how can I set out to make an inquiry into a question when I know that  I have no ready solution for it?
 Let no one however run away with the idea, from this, that I have washed my hands of this question for good. I am simply biding my time like an expert physician who has faith in his remedy. It is my firm belief that mine alone is the sovereign remedy for this seemingly incurable communal disease and that in the end one or both  the parties will willy-nilly accept my cure.
 In the mean time those who want will fight, in spite of whatever I might say. Nor do they need any prompting from me. This I have said repeatedly; I do not want any cowardice in our  midst.  The heroism of ahimsa cannot be developed from cowardice. Bravery is essential to both himsa and ahimsa. In fact it is even more essential in the latter for ahimsa is nothing if it is not the acme of bravery.

387,,"HOW TO MEET BASE
INNUENDOESlibtech_452_footnote","
      
 What should a public worker holding a responsible position in public life do if he is subjected to dishonest and malicious innuendoes or is falsely accused of misappropriation of public funds? Should he bring an action for libel against his calumniator in a law-court? Will it not be his duty as a responsible public worker to do so, and is it not likely that if he fails to do so some unwary people would be deceived? And if one may in no circumstance bring an action in a law-court, is there not a real danger that unscrupulous persons might take shelter behind a brazen silence and defy public scrutiny into their malpractices while pretending to follow your advice? Again if recourse to law-courts must be ruled out altogether, does it not follow that some other remedy against the evil of unrestrained libel should be found?
These are some of the questions arising out of the case of a
 prominent public worker that I have been called upon to answer. My reply is that slander and misrepresentation have always been the lot of public men. The way to overcome the opponent is by non-resistance and that is the remedy needed in the present case. Nor is a successful action in the law-court by any means a conclusive proof of a man’s innocence, for do we not meet everyday instances of scoundrels who use the certificates of law-courts as a cloak to hide their sins and to continue with impunity their practices? Again can any penalty that a law-court may inflict stop the poison of evil tongues from spreading? Would not what was said openly before be now, for fear of penalty, propagated secretly and in whispers and thus be rendered all the more insidious? My advice, therefore, generally speaking, is that one should take no notice of baseless and malicious imputations, but pity the calumniator and always hope and pray for his ultimate conversion. As for the public it can always take care of itself against dishonest servants. Corruption will be out one day however much one may try to conceal it, and the public can, as it is its right and duty, in every case of justifiable suspicion, call its servants to strict account, dismiss them, sue them in a law-court, or appoint an arbitrator or inspector to scrutinize their conduct, as it likes. Therefore instead of suing one’s calumniator in a law-court for false allegations of corruption, the best and the only right course would be for the public to prevent actual corruption from taking place by maintaining a sleepless vigilance and for the servant to keep the public on the qui vive.
 If this course is found to be insufficient and some further action is felt to be necessary, the author of a libel can be called upon to bring his charge before a panchayat. The aggrieved party can offer
 
 
 at the same time to appear before it to vindicate its position. Of course this remedy would be useless when the calumniator is an altogether unscrupulous person. For he will never agree to appear before the panchayat. But where allegations are made by respectable persons offering to produce evidence in support, reference to a panchayat would be found to be most useful.
 ‘But what about the villain who fakes a silent hauteur to mask his villainy,’ one may ask. My reply is that if the people are vigilant and wide awake such a person will not be able to maintain his mask for long, while, if on the other hand they allow their vigilance to go to sleep, not all the law-courts in the world will be able to prevent the practice of villainy. For we daily see how law is unable to touch gentlemen rascals dressed in spotless white, and going about in motor-cars. The fact is, as Carlyle has observed, that the fool and the scoundrel go always hand in hand. Where there is one the other is bound to be. But a true and just man need not worry on that account. Let him remember and ponder over what Dadu has sung:
 My reviler is like a respected and dear brother unto me. He labours for my good for nothing,
 And helps to purge me of my countless sins
 And comes to my aid without expectation of reward. He loses his own soul but that of others he saves;  He is my dear friend—my saviour;
 O Ramdev, pray to God for his long life—may he live for ever. My reviler is my greatest benefactor, says Dadu,
 For he brings home to me my littleness.
 It is enough if one is true to one’s own self: one can then safely let the “turbid streams of rumour flow”.

 ASHRAM, WARDHA,
 December 2, 1928
 BHAISHRI CHHAGANLAL,
 I have your letter. You are right in what you say about labour and your method of counting the payment is also correct. When such paid labour is required, those who can put off their other work may offer to do such labour after finishing the work which they do as sacrifice. They may let go their study on that day and utilize the time
 in labour. The labour which they put in should be of a useful nature, otherwise it would amount to our giving them some charity out of the Ashram funds.
 Here, too, it has rained. They say it is normal in this part. You did right when, having missed the post, you did not send a telegram and thereby saved 12 annas.
 My letter had two sheets only. You should not have found the continuity broken at any point. I put down the figure 3 for the third page. I do not write the page number on the back, but keep it in mind.
 I know that the cloth-lined envelope is very costly. I have not succeeded in getting Subbiah, Pyarelal and Mahadev to use it, but this is how it should be used. It should be opened with a knife and closed every time with a fresh slip of thick paper. On the side on which the address is written, a piece of thick paper should be pasted afresh every time. If used thus, we can make such an envelope last a long time. Do you not know that in prisons some such device is followed in order to save expenditure even on ordinary covers?
 If you are not troubled by  the question raised by  Shankerlal, I certainly am not. If Narandas works in obedience to you and the organizational set-up, our purpose and that of the organization will be met. When Shankerlal raises the question with me, I shall discuss it. The question before me is not how to satisfy him but how to satisfy you. You should, be able to do your work smoothly and may ask me for whatever help you need for that purpose.
 It was good news that Shankerbhai has recovered. Tell him that he should not fall ill again.
 Have you given any sewing work to Gangadevi? If you have not, please do.
 I got today’s post in the afternoon. Chi. Narandas is upset. I send his letters to you. If all of you agree, let them all remain [in the Ashram] on the basis suggested by Chi. Narandas and let Radha’s name be counted for payment. I have objection against this arrangement, too, but I do not wish to be obstinate. I would certainly not hurt Narandas.
 I thought it was decided to retain Shanabhai. If there is nothing more than suspicion against him, it would not be proper to ask him to leave.

            DEAR 	DR. BIDHAN,         SATYAGRAHA 	ASHRAM, WARDHA,  December 	3, 1928 
  	Your letter makes sad reading. It is remarkable you accuse me of not 	having dealt fairly by the Committee whereas I should be the 	accuser. I had felt that I had shown the most delicate consideration 	to the Committee and in the attempt had suppressed myself. Lest at 	the last moment the Committee might feel offended, I have forced 	myself on your attention and tried to argue with you all and then to 	let you decide what you liked without exposing you to any criticism 	from me in the Press.  	But to business now. If the published reports are true, your letter 	is not. Here is a tit-bit. The Exhibition authorities have 	approached all local Governments for exhibits! But perhaps you do 	not know what has happened. Nor 	do I like this deference to Panditji’s wishes. I have prom-    
 ised that I shall attend the Congress in any event. Why should the Committee not work out its policy unhampered by personal consider- ations? Why should there be a public misunderstanding because I do not attend the Exhibition or the A.I.S.A. is not represented?
 But there it is. You have rescinded your previous resolution. I have therefore wired to you and the Secretary of the A.I.S.A. as also Satis Babu, the Bengal Agent. I do not know how far it will be possible to organize the khaddar court. You will please now get hold of Satis Babu and other workers and do whatever is possible.
 My grief was there. Your decision and letter have not eased it. There is an unreality about the whole thing. O God, lead us from the unreal to the Real.
 There is nothing personal in this letter. It is the outpouring of a troubled soul.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I have your letter written by Gangabehn. There is some point in what 	you say about the noise. But the responsibility for it lies not only 	with the children but also with the adults. Again, it should not be 	difficult for you to observe silence or to make the children observe 	silence while dining or working. The main point is this: You should 	not think that if there is no talking, time will hang heavily while 	dining or working; or that the children cannot be kept quiet. There 	are millions of men who do their work quietly. You know, do you 	not?, that labourers in big factories are forced to keep silent 	while working. Why cannot we voluntarily do what they have to do 	under compulsion?  	Hereafter Kakasaheb will be with you once a week. Do you still 	insist on Valjibhai too coming there? If I press him, he will come; 	but  I know that he is always too busy and so, as a rule, I do not 	like to put any more burden upon him, if I can help it.

  	The reports that I have received while writing this on the 4th 	December are hopeful. By contributing Rs. 15,000 on his own behalf 	at the Wardha meeting, Shri Ghanshyamdas Birla has made a good 	beginning. A committee consisting of worthy persons has been for-     
 med in the Punjab and it hopes to collect a good amount. I hope that Gujarat and the Gujaratis will as usual contribute a share which will be worthy of them. If we have genuine feelings for the “Lion of the Punjab”, if we accept the worthiness of this Memorial and if we have confidence in those who have formulated the scheme for this Fund as well as in the trustees, it should not take long for it to be fully subscribed. And it is a matter of prestige for us that not much time should elapse before this is done. Hence it is my hope that Gujarat will pay up whatever is to be subscribed as soon as possible. The students of Shraddhanandji’s Gurukul had years ago, by sending for the South Africa struggle Rs. 300 to Rs. 400 earned as wages for working as labourers, answered the question of what should be done in such cases by students and salaried workers, who do not have large sums of money to spare and are hardly able to make both ends meet. Some can contribute their share by working as labourers, while for those who are unable to do so, or though being able do not find such an opportunity, the way is open on such occasions to give up certain pleasures for a specific period of time. If they are addicted to anything, they can save money by giving up their addiction for a short or long period or they may give up an item of food, as was done by the women-teachers and girls of Kanya Gurukul in Dehra Dun at the time of the struggle in Bardoli. Hence there are many ways open to those who wish to contribute to this Fund. We have formed an evil habit that we do not contribute anything until someone approaches us for funds. It is to be hoped that no one will wait for people  to approach him for donations in the case of a memorial for a patriot like Lalaji.

 CHI. RAMNIKLAL,
 I received both your letters concerning non-violence. I have preserved them. I am despatching the matter about Bhai Bechardas for Navajivan. That article could have been more clearly written. Had the tales been given, they would have been useful to scholars. But now I shall not take more of your time in this matter. It is  absolutely essential to bring light to the present atmosphere of darkness and depression. I have received another pure-hearted letter from the editor of Jain Jagat. He writes that the material provided by him is insufficient. He writes that the present idea of non-violence lacks clarity of conception and is devoid of spirituality. I for one exper- ience this at every step . . . Pure behaviour is the only true means to get over that deficiency. Therefore the article does not interest me. If pure non-violence does not enter our practice, what purpose can be
 
 served by learned articles? If we can keep our behaviour pure the scholarship of the whole world will come to our help. Hence, preserve your health and allow yourself as little as possible to be dragged into the whirlpool of thoughts. In fact I would say that you should not allow yourself to be so dragged. We should certainly devote ourselves to the thoughts that are necessary to improve our behaviour. The rest of the thoughts are mere whims. I do wish you would give me news of your physical state.

 BHAISHRI VITHALDAS,
 I got your letter. I understand the position about honey. I have been witnessing good evidence of our economic, physical and intell- ectual poverty.
 You have thought more than I have about methods of khadi propaganda. If you get financial help in your efforts, you will be able to do better work. That is, you will be able to look after the khadi work in the whole country. See that you acquire excellent health. In- stead of remaining in Bombay and getting crushed under the burden of work there, you should better go to Matheran and improve your health. I trust you are not grieving over Velabehn’s passing away.
 Remember Narasinh Mehta’s utterance:“Welcome the snapping  of the bond, I shall cultivate bhakti for Shri Gopal the more easily.”
 Blessings from

  	I got your letter. I expect to get from you detailed news about the 	Ashram. Does the kitchen run punctually? Is the noise less? Does 	everybody help Gangabehn? Is anyone ill? How does Balbir behave? How 	does Padma fare?  	You want to hear about me. If I get some time, I would certainly 	write. As it happens, however, I get no time here even to talk with 	anyone. I keep Pyarelal also very busy with work, so he too cannot    
 spare time. Be patient for a while.
Prabhavati must have left now, and so I do not write to her.
If I knew that Vidyavatilibtech_476_footnotelibtech_477_footnotewas there, I would have written to her.
If she is there tell her that she ought not to fall ill.

 Wednesday [December 5, 1928]libtech_478_footnote
 BHAISHRI CHHAGANLAL,
 I have your letter. I would advise you to show to Narandas all the letters I write to you. This will make your path easy and will help him too. I have written to him advising him that he should not keep aloof.
 If Santokbehn wishes to leave for Rajkot, let her do so. You may certainly see her and try to dissuade her. I shall be happy if she likes the Ashram atmosphere and decides to stay on. But I would not like her staying in such a condition of mind that I would have to strive every day to keep her pleased and contented.
 It is natural and desirable that one’s relations should become one’s co-workers in national work. The difficulty comes only when the motive is of self-interest. Once we are convinced that we are pursuing no personal interest, we can invite all our relations to join us; if they do join, it will be only to offer themselves as oblations in a sacrifice.
 Rama’s co-workers were his relations, and so were Yudhishthira’s. The co-workers of Prophet Mahomed, too, were his relations. Jesus’s co-workers included a brother of his. Lord Salisbury had surrounded himself with relations. When he was criticized for that, his reply was: “If not my relations, whom else shall I sacrifice? In whom, if not in them, should I put my trust? If I had more relations who were worthy of the honour, I would sacrifice them too. For me, this is a sacrifice and not a means of amassing wealth.”
 Balfour was a relation of Lord Salisbury’s. We find innumerable instances of a contrary nature, too, in which relations are fixed up in
 
 places to help them serve themselves. The upshot of this is that to one who is prompted by unselfish motives, relations and non-relations are the same. When one is prompted by selfish motives, what difference does it make if the co-workers are not relations? Even so, all of us, as you say in your letter, should be careful. I am convinced that my experiment has not cost me anything. You may also believe this to be true about our equals. In our country, equals cannot easily work together, because the spirit of self-sacrifice has not yet been fully developed.
 I have not understood exactly your question about the goshala.
You will have to explain it further before I understand it.
 We should let Lahoriram stay with us as long as he is not confined to bed and goes his way. It will be another matter if he cannot control his palate. If we are convinced that he is a good man, we cannot send away a person who has joined us. The case would have been different if we had not admitted him when he first came.
 It should be enough if we keep ourselves ready to lay down our lives when robbers raid the Ashram. God will preserve our honour. The best thing would be that one of our men should go and work among the robbers.

 eyes are as our eyes, and she has the same desires as we have.
 Total world disarmament, the only material safeguard of peace, should be the outward and visible sign of that inward mental disarmament on which alone outward peace can rest secure. So long, however, as one people is actually subjecting another to itself by superior military might, even the very first step towards this inward mental disarmament has not been taken.
 What has this got to do with India? Everything.
 When the Russian delegates made their historic proposals for total world disarmament before the Special Disarmament Committee of the League of Nations, what really prevented Great Britain from agreeing? India. In India are some 70,000 British troops and some 1,40,000 native levies, costing some £70,000,000 a year keeping some 350,000,000 Indians subject to British rule. When the Egyptians make their periodic attempt to secure peaceably the independence of their country from British domination, what prevents Britain from granting their request? India. The Suez Canal is the main route to India.
 Disarmament would mean to Great Britain the loss of the ‘brightest jewel’ in the British imperial crown . . . It is a disagreeable saying, but true, that empires rest on armaments. . . .

415,,ITS GORY CAREERlibtech_480_footnote,"
      
 The certificate granted by the Punjab Government to the police seems to have emboldened the Lucknow police to outdo the Punjab police in the free use of the baton and the spear. The Lucknow police seem according to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to have  even  used brickbats in order to disperse an utterly innocent crowd. Granted that the processionists were defying orders supposed to be legal, the police, I hold, were not justified in charging the processionists unless injury on the part of the latter to person or property was imminent. I rely implicitly on Pandit Jawaharlal’s narrative. According to it the crowd was orderly and well behaved. It was not out to do any harm to anybody. Its motive was known to be a  peaceful  demonstration against the entry into Lucknow of a Commission that has been imposed upon the people against their will. The exercise by the police of punitive powers in such circumstances was arbitrary, uncalled for and brutal. The behaviour of the crowd in the face of this provocation and in the face of a cowardly assault upon their chosen leader Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and his companions was amazingly exemplary.
 
 Their self-restraint was as great as their leaders’. I claim that no crowd outside India would have retained the calmness that the Lucknow crowd did.
 But this calmness is probably mistaken for cowardice by the brave Commissioners who under the protecting wing of an armed police seem to be bent upon continuing their blood-red progress. Innocent blood was spilt in the Punjab and severer injuries seem to have been inflicted by the police in Lucknow on an equally innocent crowd. Two men are said to have been so badly injured as to be in danger of losing their lives. Difficult as the conduct of the English Commissioners is to understand, that of their subordinate Indian colleagues is still more difficult to understand. They do not seem to perceive the widening gulf between them and the people whom they are supposed to represent and whom (some of them flower of the nation) they are content to see trampled under horses’ hoofs, charged with batons and driven with spearheads like cattle for the heinous offence of daring to demonstrate against this unwelcome Commission. Well did the enraged father and patriot Pandit Motilal Nehru give a warning to the Government, that “if a violent disturbance takes place in this city or any other part of the country, the responsibility for that would fall upon such officials as misbehaved themselves for the last three days at Lucknow”. My fear is that the Government do not mind, if they would not actually welcome, such a disturbance. If a disturbance takes place, they will have another opportunity of showing the red claws of the British Lion and of terrorizing a docile people into abject submission to their imperious will.
 For if the Government do not desire an outbreak of violence on the part of the people and if the Commission will persist in their peregrinations, they should notify to the latter that they should instead of going from place to place summon witnesses to a central place and finish their work. But such wisdom and a consideration for popular will are hardly to be expected of the Government.
 The duty before the people is clear, to continue their non- violence in the face of the gravest provocation. Then one may safely regard these great demonstrations as so many lessons in non-violence preparatory to the final struggle in which people will willingly and valiantly lay down their lives without the slightest retaliation. That day is fast coming, faster than most of us imagine. So far as I can see, sacrifice of precious lives will have to be made before we come to our own, whether in a struggle wholly non-violent or predominantly violent. I am hoping and praying that non-violence will be maintained even up to the last heat.

416,,“FAULT OF MAN”,"
      
 I know it is very easy of us to give advice; but only those who live amongst the nuisance can realize how destructive monkeys are, and as one who has suffered some small loss at their small, mischievous hands I can sympathize.
 And yet is it the fault of man or monkeys—this impasse? Why do monkeys come into the cities, near the dwelling places of men, risking, poor wretches, their lives, and the lives of their dearly loved babies for food?
 Said an official to me just recently at Mt. Abu: “The monkeys are too dreadful a nuisance, and yet we are not allowed to shoot them. They get worse and worse every year, I wonder why.”
 And yet the reason is obvious. From every jungle tree.  Jamboo, Karenda and Bod, we see man, with perfect disregard for everything but his own selfish purposes, stripping the trees of their fruit to the last berry.
 The Bhils of Abu take down hundreds and hundreds of baskets, one sees them rotting at Abu Road.
 The sahibs’ butlers have learnt to make Karenda jam; it costs only the sugar and the picking.
 Man encroaches ruthlessly on the rights of animals and birds, but punishes with severity any encroachment by them on his supreme rights.
 Do the gods treat men thus? I see in the misery that presses on man . . . the awful reckoning due to this continual encroachment on the privileges of bird and animal.
 It is nature’s retribution: a retribution that has already come to the sailors on ships who shot the ‘Stormy Petrel’ whose appearance warned them of storm, shot them to extinction. Men destroyed birds in thousands and saw their dear ones in the grip of the malarial mosquito whose larvae are now too many for man’s scope.
 Thus writes a fair correspondent who is a lover of bird and beast. Unfortunately for me she  adds  to  my difficulty,  does not solve it. Knowing the wrongs done by my kind, am I to give up agriculture and seek the cave, or am I to prevent the monkeys’ encroachment? The natural consequence of her reasoning which I do not deny is that the monkeys should have full play of my garden’ in other words I should grow for them what my fellowman has robbed them of !!!

WARDHA,
 
     DEAR 	DR. BIDHAN,  December 	6, 1928 
  	Panditji is anxious that I should be by his side as early  as 	possible after his arrival in Calcutta and that I should be staying 	as near him as possible. He now wires saying that the Reception 	Committee has arranged to accommodate both of us under the same 	roof. As you know I have always a large party with me. I am sure 	therefore that it would be inconvenient for the Reception Committee 	to accommodate that party under the same roof as Panditji’s. I 	therefore suggest that you reserve a little accommodation for me so 	that if necessary I may detach myself from my party and stay with 	Panditji. But if the Committee does not mind, I propose to accept 	the offer of Sjt. Jiwanlal to accommodate the whole of my party. I 	have accordingly telegraphed to you today.  	I do not know to whom I should really write officially. If necessary 	therefore you will pass on this letter to the proper quarters.  	As at present arranged I reach Calcutta on the morning of the 23rd 	by Calcutta Mail.

  	You must have  got  my  telegramlibtech_483_footnoteabout  the  Exhibition.  The whole thing is 	finished now. You will do what you can. I wonder if they are giving 	you a free hand.     
 I reach Sambalpur on the 21st instant, leave there on the 22nd and reach Calcutta 23rd Mail. I shall have to put up with Jiwanlal. Panditji wants me to be available at Calcutta from the 23rd and I am anxious to give him all the help that I can. He is shouldering a tremendous burden.
 As you know Sjt. Birla has been with me all these days and we have been discussing many matters, khadi, etc. I suggested to him that he should take up all surplus khadi to relieve the congestion wherever there may be, so as not to interfere with production. He entertains the idea favourably and may make a cautious beginning at once.
 He asked me whether, if he made the beginning with Calcutta and started a khadi shop where he could collect khadi from all parts of India, whether you would not object. I told him that in the circumstances placed by me before him, there was not likely to be any objection on your part.
 I have revived my original idea of pooling the prices. But you will consider this proposition and if you think that there is any objection, you will please let me know.
 Mahavir Prasad whom perhaps you know and who is a very enthusiastic honest  worker  and  who  is  at  present  in  Gorakhpur  has offered to undertake  the  responsibility  of running  the  new store for Sjt. Birla. He is proceeding today to Calcutta. I have asked him to see you and discuss things with you. This letter will be in your hands 24 hours after he reaches there.
 I hope you and Hemprabhadevi are keeping quite fit in spite of the strain that both of you must be undergoing."

     BHAISHRI 	CHHAGANLAL,  December 	6, 1928 
  	I have your letter.  I  see  nothing  suspicious  in  the  fact  	that Chi. Santok retained those bills with her against the price of 	the wheat. I can understand how Chi. Narandas may have seen this in 	a different light. 
 The capacity for self-sacrifice of Chi. Santok and her children cannot be compared with yours or of anybody else. In such matters we can make no comparisons. The sacrifice by one person of all he possessed may seem insignificant in comparison with a small sacrifice by another person. It makes me unhappy that I do not get from Santok and hers as much as I had expected. This last episode, too, is painful. But in this case I do not wish to go further than Chi. Narandas would like and so I have loosened the reins. If, now, Radha works for payment, let her do so.
 You, on your part, should always tell me what you think right and, in all matters in which you may exercise your freedom, you should do so. If you act thus, you will feel that your burden of res- ponsibility has become much lighter. After having taken certain steps, never enter into a discussion about them with anyone. It is another matter if you explain the matter to me, when that is necessary. Instead of comparing yourself with anyone, consult your  antaratmanlibtech_484_footnote; when that is pleased, when your actions or words are not prompted by par- tiality or aversion, have no fear at all.
 About Shanabhai your decision should be accepted as final. I have written to Shankerlal to see you in connection with the weaving section and decide everything in consultation with you. It is three days since I wrote to him. I agree with your view of the matter. All that remains to consider is how to solve the difficulties that may arise in doing what you suggest. Since the problem has come up, I will solve it once for all.
 The news that Kusumbehn still gets fever worries me. I think the fact that I have not brought her with me is also a contributory cause of the fever. Mental agitation aggravates every disease. I have observed that its effect is more pronounced in malaria and similar diseases. She has remained behind, though she was extremely eager this time to accompany me. I do believe that from her own and from every other point of view it was desirable that she should remain there. That is why   I insisted that she should stay behind.
 Here Chhotalal has once again been confined to bed. In his case, too, the mind has had an important share. He has made other mistakes too. The bakery here is ready, but the first lot of bread turned out was not good. How is bread-making progressing there?

  	How is this? Fever again? Mental agitation is certainly a 	contributory cause. I have even left with Ramniklalbhai some Italian 	pills. If they do not have an adverse effect on you, you should take 	them for some time. Many persons take these pills in place of 	quinine. You were probably present when Motilalji praised them. It 	was he who sent those with Ramniklalbhai. Use them and see if they 	help you. If you do not wish to take them, I believe you must take 	quinine for some days. If you take Kuhne bath at the same time, the 	toxic effects of quinine, if not altogether counteracted, will at 	any rate be mitigated. My further advice is that, till you are 	completely all right, that is, for ten days at least, you should 	live only on milk and fruit. Spend as much as you like. In cases 	like yours, exclusion of fruit from the diet should be regarded as a 	crime. You know that during the first spell of fever also it was 	fruit which had helped you. I assume that you will do what I have 	suggested.  	While the fever is on and as long as the weakness persists, do not 	be too eager to do physical work.

         MY 	DEAR BHAI,         December 	7, 1928 
  	I have your letter as also the contribution to the Maganlal 	Memorial. I do not know what other object to commend to your 	attention. There is of course the untouchability work and there is 	women’[s] work and there is the general national education work. 	There is tannery in terms of cow-protection, Hindi propaganda, 	agricultural improvement; these are the spending departments apart 	from the activities that can be properly called political. For me 	the foregoing constructive activities are an integral part of solid 	political work. The other, that is, the destructive type is 	absolutely useful and necessary, but it takes up the least part of 	my time.  	What you tell me about Leon does surprise me. With the strictly 	abstemious life free of excitement that Millie lived when she was 	bearing Waldo and Leon and the hygienic and natural upbringing that 	the two boys had, I cannot understand the premature death of Waldo 	and the trouble with Leon. I suppose that the deadly poisonous 	atmosphere of London is responsible for shattering even  such 	splendid constitutions as those of your boys. I am glad that Leon 	has recovered from the serious part of the disease and I hope that 	he will regain his hearing completely. How I wish it was possible to 	give Leon an open air life instead of the wretched solicitor’s 	desk. I 	am glad you were successful about British Guiana. The 	model of the Welsh spinning-wheel had not arrived when I    
 acknowledged it. It did arrive safely for which many thanks. I have at the Ashram a full wheel of that type. It was sent by some German friend.
 The calf incident has provided me with much instruction and an equal amount of amusement. It has thrown on me a tremendous amount of work in that I have to go through dozens of letters or rather essays on ahimsa. The majority of which were not in ahimsa but himsa tone. I do not know that I ever held a different view from the one I have now expressed though I had not as clear a perception of it as I seem to have now. You may not remember that  when  West  brought to me a cat whose head was full of maggots and was living in tortures, I endorsed his suggestion that the poor animal’s life should be ended by drowning and it was done immediately. And at the Ashram too I allowed Maganlal to destroy rabid dogs.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter as also copy of the Macmillan Company’s. I must confess that I do not like the tone of their letter. But I suppose they cannot look at this transaction in any other light but that of a business job, whereas I think I have told you I have never entered into any business transactions about my writings. Nor did I enter into this transaction from any pecuniary motive.
 Mr. Andrews is in direct correspondence with you and between you two you may do what you can with the Macmillan Company.
 The Macmillan Company are mistaken in thinking that the autobiographical articles will be handed to them in a  compressed form. When the chapters come to an end, they will be handed to them just as they are. For I should not have the leisure to compress them, and even if I tried, I should not know how to do so for the Western reader.

 The Hasmukhrai chapter does not surprise me. In outbursts of
 enthusiasm he wishes to do many things, but cannot do them. I would advise you not to entrust him with outdoor work. If he becomes en- grossed in the industrial activities of the Ashram, he will probably forget other things. Let him leave whenever he wishes to. I have no doubt that he is a really good man.
 If Shardabehn can sincerely and wholly dedicate herself to service, I would regard the mistakes she has made as the fruit of God’s grace towards her. Certainly, she has ability. I am awaiting her letter.
 If Radha is ready to work and if the family wishes to stay on, fix her pay. I cannot say whether, after my rather strong letter, they will stay. I expected Radha’s letter today.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I have your letter. I both like and do not like your suggestion. I like it if Santok, Radha and Rukhi have their heart in the Ashram, if they can tolerate a simple life and like the common kitchen. If, however, they are ready to identify themselves with the Ashram, they should indeed have faith in its ideals and try to live within Rs. 12. They could tell me if they found the sum too small. We would  certainly not let anyone fall ill and die. If there is excessive expen- diture on account of Manjula, it is certainly not Kashi who will meet the excess. What I yearn to see in them is faith in the Ashram and readiness to live in poverty. I have not seen these in them, nor in others. When I don’t see them in Santok and Radha and Rukhi, I naturally feel hurt. We should not allow the atmosphere in the whole Ashram to be spoiled because of their attitude. If the Ashram life does not suit the other inmates, they may leave it. If it does not suit Santok, even then the Ashram must provide for her maintenance. This is how I feel in the matter. But what you brothers say will be final with me. Even among the brothers, it is for you to think over the matter and guide the other brothers and me. I have already writtenlibtech_502_footnotelibtech_503_footnoteand explained that Radha should be paid a regular salary. I have written to her, but she has not yet replied to my letter.

 AN UNNATURAL FATHER
 A young man has sent me a letter which can be given here only in substance. It is as under:
 I am a married man. I had gone out to a foreign country. I had a friend whom both I and my parents implicitly trusted. During my absence he seduced my wife who has now conceived of him. My father now insists that the girl should resort to abortion; otherwise, he says that the family would be dis- graced. To me it seems that it would be wrong to do so. The poor woman is consumed with remorse. She cares neither to eat nor to drink, but is always weeping.   Will   you   kindly   tell    me    as    to    what    my    duty    is    in  the case?
 I have published this letter with great hesitation. As everybody knows such cases are by no means unfrequent in society. A restrained public discussion of the question therefore does not seem to me to be out of place.
 It seems to me clear as daylight that  abortion  would  be  a crime. Countless husbands are guilty of the same lapse as this poor woman, but nobody ever questions them. Society not only excuses them but does not even censure them. Then, again, the woman cannot conceal her shame while man can successfully hide his sin.
 The woman in question deserves to be pitied. It would be the sacred duty of the husband to bring up the baby with all the love and tenderness that he is capable of and to refuse to yield to the counsels of his father. Whether he should continue to live with his wife is a ticklish question. Circumstances may warrant separation from her. In that case he would be bound to provide for her maintenance and education and to help her to live a pure life. Nor should  I  see anything wrong in his accepting her repentance if it is sincere and genuine. Nay, further, I can imagine a situation when it would be the sacred duty of the husband to take back an erring wife who has completely expiated for and redeemed her error.
 THE TRAGEDY OF A YOUNG COUPLE
A young man writes:
 I am fifteen years of age. My wife is seventeen. I am in a great fix. I was opposed to this ill-assorted union all along, but my father and my uncle instead of paying heed to my protest only flew into a temper and began to
 
 
 scold me and call me names, and the father of the girl just for the personal satisfaction of securing a rich alliance married his child to me although I was at that time of tender age and younger than she. How stupid! And why could not my father leave me alone instead of forcing an incompatible match upon me and landing me into a pit? Could I have understood at that time the implications of the thing I would never have suffered myself to be married. But that is now all over and done. What would you now advise me to do?
 The correspondent has given his name and address in full but wants the reply to be given to him through Navajivan as he is afraid that my letter may not be permitted to reach him. This is a deplorable state of things. My advice to this young man is that if he has the courage he should repudiate the marriage. For neither he nor the girl in question could possibly have had any idea of the vows that were administered to them at  the  saptapadilibtech_505_footnotelibtech_506_footnoteceremony  when  they  were married. Since their marriage they have never lived together. It is up to the young man therefore to take his courage in both hands and brave the prospect of being driven out of his home as a result of his repudiation of the so-called marriage. And I would beseech the respective parents of the couple, if my words can reach them, to have pity on their innocent children and not to force a cruel tragedy upon them. A boy of fifteen is just a stripling. He should be going to school or attending a workshop, not be saddled with the duties of a householder. I hope the parents of the couple in question will wake up to a sense of their duty. If they do not, it will be the clear duty of the boy and the girl respectfully to disregard parental authority and  follow the light of reason and conscience.

 "
447,,447. THE BLOOD-STAINED PATH,"
 The Government and the Commission do not appear to be satisfied with the senseless beating up of Lalaji and his colleagues. It seems that the Central Government has adjudged the Punjab police to be innocent and given the latter a certificate to this effect. This has provided encouragement to the police in Lucknow, because, if the police in Lahore had no reason to assault Lalaji and his colleagues, the police in Lucknow had even less excuse for attacking Pandit Jawahar- lal Nehru and his colleagues. And whereas the police in Lahore used only lathis, their counterparts in Lucknow were found to have used spears besides lathis against innocent and unarmed persons. Further, it
 
 also seems from Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru’s  account that they demonstrated their courage by showering stones on the people too. Two of these persons are in a critical condition.
 In this manner, the Commission’s path is stained with the blood of the innocent. The members of the Imperial Commission have, through country-wide strikes, black-flag demonstrations and pro- cessions, received due notice that the people do not welcome the Commission although it may have met with the approval of selected Government officials and a few peasants. Some witnesses too may go over to their side. It would be a matter of surprise if from among the population numbering crores in a vast country like India, a few people could not be found to welcome or assist the Commission. It  is, however, clear that the majority of the people who take part in politics do not welcome it. The fact that, despite this, it goes round touring from one city to another amounts to nothing but an exhibition of authority. The Commission need not travel from one city to another in search of witnesses. Neither has it to conduct any police inquiry nor make any investigations on the spot, but merely to examine witnesses who have been nominated for that very purpose. It can do this task at smaller cost, with less trouble and without irritating the people who are sufficiently enraged. It looks, however, as if it is ashamed of following this course of action. It wants garden parties to be given for its members, it wants addresses of welcome and deputations to wait on it. All this pomp and show cannot be accomplished by remaining at one place.
 However, if the Commission does not realize its limitations and if the Government does not wish to see any violation of law and order, the Government should serve a notice to the Commission, that the people are displeased by its arrival in various cities, that the majority of the people cannot tolerate its presence, that disturbances may break out in cities upon its arrival there, and that therefore it should work sitting at one place. If the Government issue such notice, the Commission would sit in one place but the Government does not wish to have a peaceful atmosphere; it wishes to exercise its authority. Hence it wishes to take round the Commission in procession from one city to another, even at the cost of suppressing the people.
 And if my guess is correct, the warning that Pandit Motilal has given the Government will have little effect. Panditji’s warning runs as follows: “Your Performance in Lucknow is such that, if any, disturbances now occur there or at any other place, your officers, who for the last three days have been behaving in an atrocious manner, will bear the sole responsibility for them.” There is no doubt that despite the indignities perpetrated by these officers, despite the fact that
 
 public leaders have been beaten up, the peaceful atmosphere that the people have maintained can be maintained in India alone. In any other part of the world outbreaks of violence would definitely follow such insults. Some people may well regard this as cowardly conduct. I believe that underlying this is the people’s training in peaceful conduct. It is my belief that the people have, to some extent, learnt the lesson of peace which they are being taught since the year 1920. Both the Pandits—father and son—have drawn the very same conclusion and in their speeches have laid emphasis on the need for peace.
 If the inferences drawn by Pandit Motilal, Pandit Jawaharlal and me are correct, the peace that has been maintained in Lucknow and Lahore is a good sign. We shall get our verdict much sooner than is generally believed. That verdict may be one which is delivered peacefully or otherwise. The present state of suspense is not going to last long. However, it is also evident that swaraj cannot be secured by the leaders merely suffering blows. There is no alternative before the public but to make great sacrifices, whether violent or non-violent. It is my prayer to God that the people may make sacrifices for upholding the pledge of non-violence which they took in 1920, so that India will gain a prime place in world history in lessons of peace. This so because this world which is filled with violence sorely needs peace, and if today there is any country on the horizon which can show the path of peace it is only India.
 While thinking of the blood-stained journey of the Commission, there is one painful fact which is a matter of shame and should not, cannot, be overlooked. Perhaps it may be regarded as something understandable that the insult to the people does not have any effect on the Commission’s British members. But it is a matter of shame and sorrow that those Indians who have been appointed  subsidiary members of the Commission are putting up with this insult  and holding on to their positions. We can see a reflection of our own weaknesses in the behaviour of these members. They are aware that members of all prominent political parties in India have boycotted the Commission. How will the people be able to forget the fact that they have ignored such a boycott?

  "
448,,448. GOOD CARDING,"
 At one time the processing of cotton had become so very common that in all the languages of the world many proverbs and figures of speech which were based on it came into use. If anyone is hypercritical, we say to him: ‘You spin yarn which is too fine.’ If anyone goes on talking uselessly and is also critical of others, we say: ‘Why do you keep carding in this manner?’ This indicates that in the art of spinning and carding people knew exactly when the limits had been exceeded either way. As we have forgotten that  knowledge today, we have also forgotten the many subtle verbal usages in our language drawn from the processing of cotton. Now as that activity is being revived, those who regard it as a sacrificial act are trying to exalt it as well and are engaged day and night in thinking out ways and means of improving and expanding it. They are aware of the fact that, along with these additions and improvements, the capacity is being gained to supplement the meagre income of the poor. With this idea in view, one who spins in order to serve writes:libtech_507_footnote
 Till now I myself was under the impression that cotton could be carded well only by drying it. This correspondent is an experienced person. He has made a careful study of the art of carding cotton. He teaches others and I find his argument well grounded. Hence this letter of his has been published in order that we may learn from the experience of experts like him. I hope that those who are interested in such activities and those who spin regularly will write of their experiences and I suggest that those who spin for sacrificial purposes should imitate the interest taken in this activity by the above writer. Those who perform their sacrificial acts should not do so merely as an onerous duty to be done with; they would take the greatest interest in the activity if they hoped to have daily darshan of God in it; they would make it more interesting and would be sorry if they were prevented or had to refrain from doing that activity on any particular day. I have seen devoted Vaishnavas worshipping their Master. Every day they add some adornment to the image. They prepare  many kinds of delicacies as offerings and feel upset if while travelling or due to ill health they cannot perform this worship. They either give up all food or at least subsist on the very minimum until they can per- form their worship. Nowadays ostentation, false pride and the desire to enjoy oneself have crept into it and it has become part of this worship.
 
 
 That form of worship has therefore become the subject of adverse criticism and those performing it instead of purifying thems-elves  very often suffer from lack of character. Such rituals which have originated in the purest of sentiments are being continuously misused in the world. Hence Narasinh Mehta has sung:
 What if one has put on a caste mark or worn a string of tulsi beads? What if one counts one’s beads and repeats the name of God? All these are merely tricks to earn one’s living.
May the great sacrifice of spinning never fall into disrepute.This
 depends on the purity and understanding of those who perform it. [From Gujarati]

Here, on the 	other hand, I am all the time writing or dictating something, with 	my head bent low, and even then I can hardly cope with the work. Of 	course I do not let the work exceed my strength. It cannot weigh me 	down with worries. I do the best I can. As a rule I go out for a 	walk twice a day. In this matter I am able to follow the rule more 	regularly here.  	You ought to improve your health. Do not for any reason miss the 	benefit of milk and fruit. For the present, live only on these two. 	If, in addition, you take a little quinine daily, you should not get 	fever again. For some time eat nothing which is of no benefit to 	your body.

 I have your letter. I have credited into the Lalaji Memorial Fund the cheque which you sent.
 I see no need for sending the Parsi or the Irish lady to the Ashram. It will suffice if they write out the various methods of making biscuits which they know. Even though no ghee or oil may have been added, the biscuits must be light.
 I read in the Timeslibtech_516_footnoteabout the 6th or 7th (December), a review of a pamphlet about how to recognize poisonous snakes. I forget the author’s name. The review appeared in the “Current Topics”. If you can get the pamphlet there, please send a copy.

 I send with this a newspaper which contains a report about the Hyderabad State and also a letter from Babu Rupanarayan. I have taken an extract from the report which was relevant to my purpose and drafted a notelibtech_518_footnoteand sent it for publication in  Young India. In my note I have also given a framework of the co-operative scheme advocated by Rupababu. Read it and think over the matter and write to me if you wish to suggest any changes.
 As regards spinning yarn of five counts, why do you say that we cannot spin yarn of over 20 counts? If you do not get there cotton of the required quality for spinning fine yarn, we get here any quantity of cotton grown from American seed. These days I spin yarn of not less than 30 counts. I find no difficulty in doing so. I do not get even tired in carding the cotton. I hardly take 15 minutes to card 3/4 tola weight of cotton and making a sliver from it. I spin yarn of 30 counts from that sliver. I, therefore, require only 3/8 of a tola weight of cotton. I have not got the strength of the yarn tested yet. I have told Chhotelal to get it tested. It may not perhaps come to much, but it should be good enough after some experience. That we should spin fine yarn is an old idea of mine. I believe that we should  wear  whatever coarse khadi we can get and should spin fine yarn and give it to those who require it. Think over this.

        WARDHA, 
     SISTERS, I 	have the letter written on your behalf.  December 	10, 1928 
  	You will get information about me from the letter written to the 	whole Ashram.  	All that is required to put a stop to the noise in the kitchen is a 	firm determination. Once you make such a determination the noise 	will definitely cease.  	If you are not at home with your kitchen work as yet, let me remind 	you that you cannot think of doing any other for another year. It is 	best therefore that you make up your mind to like your work.  	But  the  painful  incident  that  has  just  occurred  must  set  	all of you thinking. The incident is not now a secret and it should 	not be hidden. Therefore I want to discuss it here. Not one but at 	least three of you were involved in it. It is needless to point the 	finger of scorn at any of these three because all of us, whether men 	or women, might be guilty of such misconduct at some time or other 	or have already been guilty; I want you to learn two lessons from 	this incident. In the first place we must stick to our kitchen work 	for it is through it that we came to know about the misconduct. If 	we live in the shelter of    
 a home, we can never know our capacity for sin. We realize the extent of it only when a suitable opportunity presents itself. Here such an opportunity occurred, aided by [bad] company. The result was the emergence of the latent sin. The kitchen has in this way proved useful. Secondly there was not enough courage to do things openly, so theft and lying were resorted to. Why should we not do a thing we want to do boldly? Why should we be afraid of appearing as we actually are?
 If we like tasty food, why hide the fact? Craving for tasty dishes is no sin. The sin lies in hiding the craving and in secretly indulging in it. Everyone, man or woman, is at liberty to eat whatever he or she desires. That was one of our objects in converting the Satyagraha Ashram into an Udyoga Mandir. Anyone may satisfy his craving for good food, the only restriction is that the good food must be prepared in the common kitchen. None should cook delicacies whether secretly or openly in one’s private rooms. One may go out and eat a delicacy at a friend’s place, there is nothing to hide in this, or one may keep eatables such as dried fruits and so on in one’s room. It is better if such freedom is not availed of, though there is no restriction on such freedom. My earnest request to you is this: Always appear what you really are; whatever you do, do it openly. Never allow yourselves to be unduly influenced by another; if you ever promise to do a thing, never act contrary to it.
 Everyone that does kitchen work must strictly follow her routine. It does not look as though you had as yet been able to remove the fears of Gangabehn senior. Every single activity in the kitchen must go on regularly like clockwork.

         WARDHA, 
     BHAISHRI 	CHHAGANLAL,  December 	10, 1928 
  	I think all of you would like me to give in my weekly letter the 	details of my experiments in diet. I started feeling considerably 	weak from the last Wednesday or Thursday. As I had told you, I did 	not wish to persist in my experiments if I lost weight because of 	them. Vinoba, too, felt a little unhappy, for he saw my weakness; 	the weight also had gone down. On Friday, I started taking oranges 	and other fruits and included in the diet almond-milk. My weight was 	taken yesterday and it had increased by one pound. The weakness had 	begun to disappear from the vary day that I included almond-milk and 	fruits in the diet; there is no trace of it now. I still see, 	therefore, no need to include milk. I have continued oil. I see no 	harm done to anyone here through it. The loss of weight and the 	weakness may be ascribed to no other cause but the sudden reduction 	of protein in my diet. The only things which are excluded now are 	milk and ghee. My objection is especially to goat’s milk. If I can 	give it up, I shall have peace of mind. I have no aversion to 	fruits, fresh or dry. In giving them up I was prompted only by the 	consideration of expense. I will not, however, insist on excluding 	either at the cost of my health. All of you will see that the 	results so far are beneficial. Nevertheless, I wish to make no 	predictions about the outcome of the experiment. We can judge 	nothing in fifteen days. We can come to some conclusion only if the 	same condition is maintained for three months. Let no one, 	therefore, give up milk in a fit of enthusiasm. But anyone who 	wishes to try the effect of milk and linseed oil may do so. It is 	the experience of many here, including of course Pyarelal and 	Chhotelal, that fresh oil is harmless. It has done  Pyarelal  and  	Chhotelal  no  harm whatever. Subbiah has joined them now, and so 	has Vasumatibehn. These two have not been in the  experiment  for  	many  days.  It  seems, however, that linseed oil, if anyone wishes 	to experiment with its use, must be fresh. It should not be warmed. 	You may get the seeds pressed in ghanilibtech_520_footnotelibtech_521_footnotethere. 	The oil can be sent from here, but the railway freight is excessive. 	If sent by goods train, it will take a long time to reach there.   	You   can   instal   a   ghani   for   about   Rs.   l00,   	or Rs. 150. But the best course just now is to arrange with the 	owner of a    
 ghani in the city. Of course I do not insist that this matter be taken up. We experience many difficulties, and they will remain; that is why I merely set down here the effects of excluding ghee and make a suggestion about how to get the oil. Two other effects of the oil have been observed, and they are these: it acts as a laxative and stimulates appetite. It is Pyarelal’s experience that, instead of weakening, it stimulates appetite. It is the experience of the people here that it acts as a laxative. Personally I can say nothing positive about its having such an effect.
And now another subject.
 The noise in the kitchen there must stop. I expect to see this outward reform when I return there. It should not be difficult for anyone never to speak, unless quite necessary, while eating. It should also not be difficult to keep the children quiet.
 My second suggestion is that some restriction should be placed on the quantity of vegetables served. Whatever the vegetable that is cooked, the quantity per head should not exceed 10 tolas. According to medical science, more than this quantity of green vegetable is not required. I hear that attendance at prayers is again becoming thinner. It should not be necessary for me to explain at this hour of the day that no one should expect someone else to stimulate his or her interest in prayers. The interest should be felt within. As the body needs food and feels hungry, so the soul needs and feels hungry for prayer. Prayer is a form of communication with God. So long as our need for attendance at prayers is not the same as that for attendance at meals, for which we require no one to goad us, so long our faith in God is weak; or, though we subscribe to the rules of the Ashram we do not observe them and to that extent we are unfaithful to it and violate the vow of truth. Anyone who realizes this will not remain absent at prayers—whether morning or evening—without some strong reason.

 Chhotelal has now recovered. If only he would agree, I would send him away. He is a bit conceited and often interferes with affairs for which he has little aptitude. I am patient with him because he is a lover of truth and brahmacharya. Though violent by nature, he sincerely believes in non-violence. I see his many weaknesses every day, still I think well enough of him to be patient with him. And so we cling to each other.

I have got your letter.
 I questioned Keshu and he tells me that he did not write what you attribute to him. He merely described my condition and suggested that it would be better if Santok and others left the Ashram.  I believe that in such matters Keshu keeps himself within limits. Whether or not he does, you should do your duty with firmness. I have stated my views clearly. Give them the facility which Chi. Narandas has suggested and then let them live as they choose.
 Do not attach too much importance to what Shankerlal says. That is his manner of speaking. We should admit, however, that there is some truth in what he says and remove our shortcomings.
 The members of every institution which has acquired prestige in society tend to become proud. We are not free from this defect. I shall not, however, feel hurt if the office of the Spinners’ Association is finally removed from the Ashram. Our aim is to carry a burden, to do our duty, and not to enjoy authority. When one burden becomes light, we may, if we have the necessary strength, accept another. If the khadi section of the Spinners’ Association is removed from the Ashram and if we can lend to it the services of our men, we may do even that. But the position is this: the decision in the present case is to be arrived at jointly by you and Narandas. If you two can unite as milk and sugar mix and become one, the department will work and be a success. If there is a gulf between you, it will never work. In that case, it may as well be removed from the Ashram. I am neutral in this matter.
 There is no harm if the totals of the entries in regard to spinning are read on Friday. None of us understood whom you meant by Makaranilibtech_530_footnote.

I 	have endea- voured to show you that national schools whose 	foundation is truth and ahimsa cannot be built up when the teachers 	are half-hearted even regarding the very foundation. At the critical 	moment they are bound to fail. While, therefore, I honour you for 	your convictions and the brave manner in which you have stated them, 	I want you to appreciate my difficulty in trying to find financial 	support for your institution in any extraordinary manner. It must be 	also, I suggest, then a matter of honour for you whether you would 	ask for or accept money through one who is absolutely wedded to 	truth and ahimsa and for whom they are not a temporary creed but 	matters of life and death.  	In the circumstances, I would like you to consider the whole 	position and you discuss amongst yourselves what you would have me 	to do and then Sjt. Tijaray and others who do not believe in truth 	and ahimsa as their final creed should come over to Wardha and 	discuss the thing with me and come to a final conclusion. My desire 	is to help the school to the best of my ability. But I see that 	there is a moral difficulty which I had not foreseen.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a photostat: S.N. 13781

 I have your letter. There is no reason for panic. Write thus to your father-in-law:
 “Your wish ought to be a command for me. My father wants me to act in accordance with your command. I am faced with a conflict of loyalties since your son keeps writing from America telling me to live in the Ashram and study. He also wants me to study English too very well. I am quite comfortable in the Ashram. Bapuji treats me like a daughter. Ba too is good to me. Arrangements have been made for my stay in the women’s section after Rajbanshi Devijilibtech_541_footnotelibtech_542_footnoteleaves this place. I am quite safe in the women’s section. I therefore wish to stay in the Ashram as your son bids. But then I shall do as you say. And I may assure you that you need not worry on my account. While I live here I am quite alert, there are many women in the Ashram and I am on good terms with them all.”
 You may, if necessary, improve upon the language. Inform your father also regarding the developments. Give all details to Mrityunjaya and send him a copy of your husband’s letter.
 Whatever happens you should be unperturbed. Remember the shloka:  “Hold alike pleasure  and  pain”libtech_543_footnote,  etc.  Be  courageous  and recite Ramanama.

480,,THE PITFALLS libtech_544_footnote,"
    
 Describing the incidents of Lucknow in a private letter Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru writes:
 An incident which took place yesterday morning might interest you. I have not mentioned it in my statement. Soon after the mounted and foot police had driven us back near the station, a young man, whom I took to be a student, came to me and said that he could bring me two revolvers immediately if I wanted to use them. We had just experienced the baton and lathi charges and there was a great deal of anger and resentment in the crowd. I suppose he thought that it was a favourable moment to make the offer. I told him not to be foolish. Soon after I found out quite casually that this particular person was known to be in the C.I.D.
Pandit Jawaharlal was safe as he has no secrets. If he finds any use for
 revolvers in his scheme for the freedom of the country, he will not need the offer from the outsider to lend him one. He will carry it himself openly and use it effectively when in his opinion the occasion has arrived. So he was safe from the blandishments of the C.I.D. And what applies to Pandit Jawaharlal applies in a measure to all Congress- men. For happily the Congress politics abhor secrecy. Con-gressmen have ceased to talk with closed doors; they have shed the fear of the C.I.D.
 But the C.I.D. will not be itself if it does not have emissaries whose business among other things it is to expose people to temp- tations and entrap them in the nets prepared for them. It is difficult to imagine an occupation more debasing and degrading than this, and yet it has been reduced to a science by the chief governments of the world and has attracted to it some of its cleverest brains. Britain takes perhaps the first place in this occupation. Lying in the C.I.D. is culti- vated  as  a  fine  art.  Ponsonby’slibtech_545_footnoteFalsehood  in  War  Time   gives  a
 
 painful record of lying on the part of all the powers that were engaged in the pastime of mutual destruction on the false plea of philanthropy. It is a black record of crimes committed by the nations of whom Britain was not the least but probably the greatest offender. She could have stopped the War if she had been less greedy and less selfish.
 Wherever you turn in India you encounter pitfalls. To me every institution—be it the most philanthropic—run by and in the name of the Empire in India has an unmistakable taint about it. That we run to and hug most or some of them is no test of their goodness. It is test of our helplessness, short-sightedness or selfishness. We have not the courage to sacrifice much, in order to save ourselves from criminal participation in sustaining an Empire which is based on fraud and force, and whose chief, if not one, aim is to perpetuate the policy of ever-growing exploitation of the so-called weaker races of the earth.
 In a way the C.I.D. is the least dangerous of the traps so cleverly laid by the builders. Those whose exterior is attractive are really the most dangerous of all. We often fall into one of these enticing but deadly traps, before we hardly know where we are. It was for some such reason that the Romans said:“Beware of the Greeks, specially when they bring you gifts.” When an enemy comes to you bearing the look of philanthropy, he is to be most dreaded. Would that the youth of the country learnt this simple truth and avoided the pitfalls into which they daily fall even whilst they are cursing the Empire and hoping to deliver the country from the intolerable yoke which is not only ruining the nation economically but is also causing unfatho- mable moral mischief.

481,,JUSTICE RUN MAD,"
    
 I reproduce elsewhere in this issue the first instalment of a sample of the translation of the Tamil songs of the late Bharati, the Tamil poet, whose songs were the other day confiscated by the Madras Government acting under instructions, or, it is perhaps more proper to say, orders from the Burma Government. The Burma Government it appears in its turn suppressed these songs not by any order of court but by executive declaration. It appears that under that declaration the books of this popular Tamil poet which have been in vogue for the last 30 years and which, as appears from the evidence before the High Court of Madras, were under consideration by the Education Department of Madras for introduction in the school curriculum, are liable to confiscation in any part of India. I must confess that I was
 unaware of any such wide executive powers being held by Provincial Governments. But these are days in which we live and learn. This was no doubt a matter falling under the jurisdiction of the Education Minister. But it is becoming daily more and more clear that these Ministerial offices are a perfect farce, even as the legislative chambers are and that the Ministers are little more than clerks registering the will of the all-powerful I.C.S. Therefore the poor  Education  Minister could do nothing to save these popular books from confiscation. Probably at the time the confiscation took place, he had even no knowledge, or if he had, he was not even told what it was that he was really signing. In due course however the confiscation attracted public attention. Pandit Harihara Sharma of Hindi Prachar Karyalaya and publisher of Bharati’s songs, on behalf of his poor widow, could not sit still under the confiscation. He therefore moved the public and the matter was naturally debated in the Legis-lative Council which condemned the confiscation. Pandit Harihara Sharma even petitioned the High Court for an order to set aside what was clearly an illegal confiscation, and because of some understanding that the order of confiscation   will   be   withdrawn,   that   the   books   will   be returned and that the Madras Government will make reparation to the poor widow, the petition has been withdrawn. But the wrong still remains. One can only hope that the expectations of Pandit Harihara Sharma will be fulfilled and that the wrong will be remedied by the return of the books. But whatever reparation is made by the Madras Government, the sense of wrong will abide and so will the sense of in- security created in the public mind by the action of the Madras Government in slavish obedience to the Burma Government.

MY DEAR SATIS BABU,
 
 I have your letter. I am passing on your reflections on poolinglibtech_552_footnoteto Ghanshyamdasji.
 I am glad you are already in touch with Mahavirprasadji. If you have not known him before, I would like you to come in intimate con- tact with him. He is an extremely fine man sharing most of our ideals, if not all of them.
 Krishnadas is here now, and I am drinking in all the many things that he has to say about you and Hemprabhadevi and Sodepur in general. Only you and Hemprabhadevi may not kill yourselves with work. Those who work in the Gita spirit never overwork themselves, because they work with complete detachment and compete detach- ment means utter freedom from anxiety. When we work purely as His instrument with an absolute self-surrender there can be no cause for anxiety or fretfulness whatever the result or however black may be the horizon for the time being. Jesus summed up the same lesson in one sentence: “Be careful of nothing.” Krishnadas tells me Hempra- bhadevi is wearing out her body. She may not do so and let her not deny herself the ordinary creature comforts which may be essential for keeping her body up to the mark.
 
 without disturbing the local market. Pooling can be applied here by keeping the local prices as the standard and buying some dearer and some cheaper khadi from outside and selling them at the local standard price along with the local khadi.     Injurious
 pooling is pooling in a producing Province without taking the responsibility for the disposal of its whole output. For example, Mr. Jerajani may buy the best khaddar from all over India, pool the prices and sell at a standard price at Bombay. This is harmless in Bombay where there is no local khadi.”
 
 I note what you say about the Exhibition.libtech_553_footnoteI do not mind it. It is enough we do not resist and hold ourselves in readiness to help where need be and this we must do in a spirit of utter goodwill and without irritation.

When we give bread to a hungry person and advise another suffering from indigestion to fast, in both cases we are prompted by love; this, therefore, is showing an equal mind and treating an ant  and  an elephant with equal consideration. Do not assume, in dealing with him, that your new method has succeeded completely. If you patiently explain it to those who insist on following the old method and carry them with you, there will be minimum friction.
 Whether the method adopted is the old or the new one, it must be followed faithfully. Write to me from time to time about the diffi- culties which you experience. Never feel worried in the smallest mea- sure. If you feel at any time that my conclusions are based on inadeq- uate data or incorrect reasoning, draw my attention to the fact. You may have faith in the principles which I lay down, but the conclu- sions which I draw from certain facts cannot be a matter of faith.
 Faith has no place in a matter which can be grasped by reason. Hence, whenever you see my ignorance as regards facts and find the reasoning vitiated by that ignorance, please do correct me. If you make this a regular practice, I shall be able to write to you more freely and guide you better.

 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 I have started from today using ‘Chi.’ in place of ‘Bhai’; let this be a permanent change.
 It was not my fault that you received no letter on the 11th. I did write to you. You must have received two letters on the 12th. This happens sometimes when letters are given to be posted when it is about clearing time.
 It is a serious illness indeed which Ramabehn has brought with her. Do not get nervous. Take necessary measures to get her cured and everything will be all right. Other illnesses, too, will go in their due time. For Kailas’s illness, it is Dahibehn and Nanubhai who are responsible. Even children’s stomachs cannot bear any burden for ever. The same is true about Dharmakumar. The moment he is all right, he starts taking all sorts of liberties. As for Velanbehn, illness is
 part of her constitution. She, too, cannot control her palate, and Sabar- mati’s water will not let us take any liberty. From one point of view, this is for our good.
 I see nothing wrong in charging to the khadi section the expen- diture of Rs. 12 on account of those inmates of the Ashram who are being trained exclusively for khadi work.
 Whatever difficulties, internal or external, you may have to face, see that you are ever vigilant. Do not lose patience, and do not undertake any task beyond your strength. Go on doing silently whatever is necessary, and you will feel no burden.

 DEAR SISTER,
I have your letter.
 I want you to be in good health no matter how you manage it.
You must not overstrain yourself.
 I shall try to treat Sodepur on the same footing as Sabarmati. It is because I have my doubts about the feasibility of conducting the same experiments there as at Sabarmati and Wardha that I cannot regard it as such. I do not wish to spoil Sodepur by carrying on experiments there on the lines of Sabarmati. The existence of Sodepur is for the sake of khadi, while that of Sabarmati is for experiments in truth, etc. This does not mean that Sabarmati is superior. I merely defined the fields of work at the two places. I do desire to make experiments at Sodepur, similar to those at Sabarmati. But all this lies in the hands of God. Whatever be the state of affairs at Sodepur, you are in my eyes an Ashram inmate."

     DEAR 	DR. BIDHAN,  December 	14, 1928 
  	Here is a wire from the A.I.S.A. Agent in Kashmir. I know from 	personal experience that a great deal of stuff from Kashmir passes 	on as hand-spun and hand-woven, but the yarn is foreign. There is no 	question of swadeshi mill yarn in Kashmir. It is either foreign or 	hand-spun. The foreign yarn was fast displacing the hand-spun. The  	A.I.S.A. Agent has just gone to stop the rot. How far it can be 	stopped remains to be seen. But in any case his being posted there 	has resulted in exposing many a fraud.    
 May I hope that nothing will be exhibited which is not certified by the A.I.S.A.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I appreciate your warm letter. It is not want of funds that is 	keeping me from going to America. The question is far deeper than 	one of finance. My expenses have been offered by Indian friends, if 	I would but go. My difficulty is whether there is a call of duty, 	whether, that is to say, I have a message to be delivered 	personally. I wonder if my function is not limited to let the 	message drip down to America through the life that I am privileged 	to live in India supplemented or interpreted through my writings. I 	do not feel the inner urge.  	But I have undertaken, if everything is quite clear before me, to go 	to Europe about the end of April next. Whether I should then take 	America and whether I should have the time, if I felt the call, is a 	different matter.  	Let me also tell you that friends like Dr. Ward are of opinion that 	I have been right up to now in my decision not to go to America. 	They think that I would be a nine days’ wonder, would be perhaps 	lionized for a few days, but that the message for which I stand and 	which I am trying to live will be lost upon the people.

The proposal, there- fore, was not 	pursued. I have now met him. In my judgment, he is a suitable match 	for Rukhi. He is not very rich, but is quite well-to-do.

516,,SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF KHADI,"
    
 A gentleman from Mombasa who is a khadi lover has written the following letterlibtech_568_footnoteto Shri Vithaldas Jerajani, who has sent it over to me:
 The implication of this is that those who are proficient in the art of producing several articles of cloth from mill-made yarn should take an interest in khadi and get yarn produced which is twisted in varying degrees. This is a task which can be accomplished. It is being carried out to some extent but only in a very small measure. So far very few persons who have a knowledge of the techniques used in mills have taken any interest in khadi, while those who are engaged in furthering the cause of khadi have not made a study, from the standpoint of khadi, of mill-made cloth and the techniques involved in making it. Many people believe through ignorance that nothing whatever can be learnt from the industrial techniques used by mills, while others have assumed that khadi of any quality would  pass muster. Despite this, compared with the first pair of dhoti woven in the khadi cause in 1918 at the Satyagraha Ashram, the price of which was fixed at seventeen annas a yard, which was the actual cost, the khadi of today is vastly different in both quality and price. Hence it may be claimed that some workers in this movement have also paid attention to the quality of khadi. The late Shri Maganlal was the first to begin a systematic study of this matter. It has borne good results. That study is still being continued; however, I must admit that further improvements are needed. There is no doubt that much more improvement can be made if, as the above writer suggests, those who know the mill techniques devote even a little of their time to improving khadi. In order to carry out widespread propa-ganda for khadi, the maximum possible variety of quality and design should he introduced. Nevertheless, something will in the end remain where the limits of both will be marked out and the one cannot and need not resemble the other. For instance, there are some artistic achievements of khadi
 
 which the mills have to this day not been, and will never be, able to imitate. Similarly, the same quality of khadi cannot be produced in bulk as the fine-looking cloth amounting to crores of rupees which the textile mills can produce at a low cost. And there will be no need to produce it either. Mill-made cloth is produced, whether there is need for it or not, simply in order to make people use it and in order to earn larger profits. Khadi can only be produced in the quantity in which it is required. Khadi cannot have and will never have the capacity for mass production with the intention of making people wear it. That advantageous limit will always be there with regard to khadi because man is not a gross machine which can be worked beyond a certain limit. However, it is the special task of the organizers of the centres run by the Charkha Sangh to adopt all possible improvements in the quality of khadi. Let those who are dimly aware of this become fully awakened to it. Let us hope that those who are familiar with the techniques of mill-made cloth will start taking an interest in khadi and devote their time to it.

And I am possibly 	even more kind, more mild, more pliable, more docile, in your sense 	of these words, than he is. How can a Mahatma living up in the 	clouds give any lead?

Why not let the 	poor Mahatma have his lonely greatness upon earth be done with?

 why do you expect Mussalmans to be Hindus in Hindustan? Afghans don’t expect Hindus to be Mussalmans, but they may expect them to be like Afghans, that is, like the inhabitants of Afghanistan. The corr- esponding term, therefore, is Indian. For the service of India, Mussal- mans, Jews, Christians should be Indians even as Hindus should be Indians. Whilst each group will follow its own religion intact without interfering with those of their fellow groups. Surely that for-mula is quite enough for you and every one of us.

 probably like the experiment I am making here. They use oil in the food here, and so I too have started taking it. I do not wish to do anything at the cost of my health. If oil does not suit me, I will stop it.
 Kusumbehn can come here for the Gujarati work. She can certainly do justice to it but I felt that she should remain in the Ash- ram. There is Pyarelal here who attends to some of the Gujarati work. He ought to improve his handwriting. Since Keshu is with me, I can use his services too for this work, if necessary, though in fact I have brought him here for the sake of his studies and his health.
 You did well in sending Navin and Rasik to Meerut. They should should write and describe their experiences there.
 Pyarelal, Chhotelal, Subbiah, Ba and Keshu are with me here. Many others will come not from the Ashram but from outside. Ghan- shyamdas Birla arrived here only yesterday. Haribhau came today. So I expect we shall have good company here.

  	I got both your letters. You were of course forgiven. If I believe  	a girl to be foolish, she will certainly be forgiven her 	foolishness, but it ought to be pointed out to her. To excuse 	yourself by saying that you did not know how to express yourself in 	words may not be foolish- ness, but people call it cleverness or 	smartness.    
 I read today of your getting fever again. There is pride in work- ing beyond one’s strength, and the foolishness of doing so is plain enough. Those who have an iron constitution may work beyond their strength, that is, there is no work indeed which is beyond  their strength. Those who have reduced themselves to a cypher and trust everything to God, they alone can work like that. When you have such faith and can live like a cypher, you may work as much as you like. For the present, work within limits."

     SISTERS,  Silence 	Day, December 17, 1928 
  	There has been no letter from you today. But I gather from your 	previous letters that there is now comparative quiet in  the  	kitchen. Do not rest till you establish perfect quiet there. This 	job is mainly yours. Take upon yourselves the responsibility of 	making the kitchen attrac-tive in every way. It can be regarded as 	an ideal part of an ideal school only when everyone can eat in 	perfect peace, when all do their work out of a sense of duty and a 	love of perfection and remain content with whatever is served in it. 	The whole institution is a school as you know, and the kitchen is a 	school too. There the food should be scientifically stored, cooked 	and eaten. Thus in every detail there should be cleanl-iness and a 	spirit of discipline. We do not go there or dine there for sense 	gratification. The body is a temple of God; as such it has to be 	kept clean and preserved through nourishment. If you adopt such an 	attitude all the quarrels we see in regard to kitchen work will 	dis-appear. In my letter addressed to the whole of the Ashram, I 	have made four suggestions. Think over them and try to practise 	whatever appeals to you.  	Kailas, Sheela and other children must not fall ill. If any child is 	ill, do not think it is the concern and responsibility of its mother 	alone but assume responsibility for it yourselves. It should be the 	normal practice in our Ashram whenever a mother is not able or does 	not know how to nurse a sick child, for anyone who knows the job to 
 offer to look after the child. No mother should feel that she is alone with no one to help her.
I have nothing more to say.

         December 	17, 1928  CHI. 	CHHAGANLAL,  	I have your letter. Why should you get upset because of chil- dren’s 	illness? These things come and go. Sometimes we may even lose one of 	the children. God gave them and He may take them back; there is 	nothing strange in this. Besides, everyone in the world has to go 	along the royal road sooner or later, why, then, should we grieve if 	anyone leaves early? And rejoice if someone leaves late? There is no 	difference between Umi’slibtech_577_footnotesoul and that of a calf. Both are diamonds    
 from the same mine, drops from the same ocean, leaves of the same tree. One need not be afraid of whooping cough. It always disappears in due time. If we do not harass the child with too many medicines while the attack lasts, he or she lives through the attack all right. Hot water and hot milk—everything hot. The bowels should move regularly. [Give her] light massage with oil on the chest and put her in sunshine early in the morning.
 Do not be sure of Chhotelal arriving there till you actually see him of course he will arrive.
 Gangabehn should put her feet in hot water with soda bicarb mixed in it and massage them long with vaseline before going to sleep. Besides this, she must put on shoes, of any type, during day time. Since we now look upon the hide of a dead cow as sacred, there will be no harm even if she wears light slippers—not chappals—made of it. It will be enough if the slippers meant for use in the kitchen always remain in the kitchen. Slippers of rubber are also available. Slippers of hessian get wet and dirty, and they cannot be washed. Slippers made from leather can be washed.

  	What shall I tell you now? The doctor’s advice to you to eat 	everything is not correct and should not be followed. If you drink 	plenty of milk and eat plenty of fruits, your illness will certainly 	dis- appear. There is no harm in taking a little coffee with the 	milk for some time.

 [Before December 20, 1928]
 God  forbid  that  India  should  ever  take   to   industrialism after the manner of the West. The economic imperialism of a single tiny island kingdom (England) is today keeping the world in chains. If   an   entire   nation   of   300   millions   took   to   similar  economic
 
 
 exploitation,  it  would  strip  the  world   bare   like   locusts.   Unless the capitalists of India help to avert that tragedy by becoming trustees of the welfare of the masses and by devoting their talents not to amassing wealth for themselves but to the service of the masses in an altruistic spirit, they will end either by destroying the masses or being destroyed by them.

 He next turns to a khadi worker who is also accompanying him. He must agree to go to Calcuttalibtech_595_footnotewhere he is wanted in spite of his disinclination. If we could transform Calcutta we should transform the whole of India, he argues. He himself would go there and make it the centre of his activity, but . . .

 There lies my difficulty. I cannot bear the sight of it. My soul rises in rebellion against the cold-blooded inhumanity that goes on there in the name of religion. If I had the strength I would plant myself before the gate of the temple and tell those in charge of it that before they sacrificed a single innocent animal they should have to cut my throat. But I know that for me to do so would be an unreal, a mechanical thing today because I have not yet completely overcome the will to live. And till I can do that I must bear the cross of my imperfect existence.

542,"December 20, 1928","DISCUSSION WITH A
TEACHERlibtech_596_footnote","
    
 [Before December 20, 1928] A deputation of the teachers of a national school has come to wait upon Gandhiji.	In the course of conversation one of the teachers lets out that he holds
 non-violence as a creed only for individual conduct. In the political field he holds to
 non-violence only as a temporary expedient. Gandhiji starts as at a snake in the grass. ‘Are there many other teachers in your school who think like this?’ he quietly asks. But his countenance betrays what is passing in his mind. The teacher notices this and tries to explain his position. True, he believes in non-violence in politics
 
 pas a policy but a policy is as good as a creed while it lasts, if it is sincerely and conscientiously adhered to. For the time being therefore there is no difference between his position and Gandhiji’s. As for the future, if he should feel like changing his policy he would surely obtain the permission of the school authorities first for doing so. But the explanation fails to satisfy Gandhiji.
 Don’t you see the difference, with you non-violence is only an intellectual proposition, with me it is an article of faith, the first and the last. You try to make a distinction between individual conduct and social conduct. I do not see how it is possible. Where is the line to be drawn? And who is to decide where the one ends and  the  other begins?	‘As with the individual so with the universe.’ You say that your abandonment of non-violence would be conditioned by the permission of the school authorities. But let me tell you that in the circumstances postulated by you there should be no room for asking such permission. For then, you would be bound to sacrifice your school at the altar, according to your belief, of your country just as I would my country at the altar of truth and non-violence. And I would honour you for doing so. No, I do not want to blame you. You must follow the light of your convictions. I am only trying to view the question from a different angle. There are at present a number of national institutions in the country with truth and non-violence as their creed. I have my eye upon them constantly. For a time is fast coming, it may, as I wrote in Young India the other day, come much sooner than most people expect, when the country will be put upon its trial, and will have to make its final choice. I count upon these institutions in that hour to give a good account of themselves. Maybe a mere handful of workers as we are, we shall have to make a holocaust of ourselves to testify our faith. So far I had believed that I was absolutely safe in your hands. But I now see where  I stand. But that need not make you feel unhappy; it is a question for me only to think about.
 There is a deep note of sadness in his voice as he utters these words. . . .

 We must distribute production and centralize sales for the time being. We must try the experiment of pooling prices of khadi produced in various centres to bring down the average. Look at the figures of mill khadi.      libtech_599_footnotelibtech_600_footnoteWhat does it indicate? A revolution in the
 people’s taste. They are prepared to make a sacrifice. They ask for coarse cloth. But they are being foully deceived by the mill-owners who do not hesitate to exploit their patriotic sentiment. Spurious khadi is being palmed off on them as Gandhi cloth, even my portrait is put upon it. Could there be a greater fraud or a worse betrayal? But the moral for us in this is that we must increase our production. And to do this we must bring about a general reduction in khadi prices by pooling. Do they ever think what a fierce resentment it will cause among the masses when they discover, as they are bound to one day, that they have been betrayed at every step? I should not be surprised, if in a frenzy of anger they should in that event rise against the mill industry in general.

544,,THE ETERNAL DUEL,"
    
A friend writes:
 In the article entitled “The Tangle of Ahimsa” appearing in Young India of October 11th, you have stated most forcefully that cowardice and ahimsa are incompatible. There is not an ambiguous syllable  in  your statement. But may I request that you tell us how cowardice can be exorcised from a man’s character? I notice that all characters are but the sum total of habits formed. How are we to undo our old habits and build the new ones of courage, intelligence, and action? I am convinced that habits can be destroyed, and better and nobler habits can be formed giving birth to a new character in a person. It seems to me that you know prayers, discipline, and studies by which a man can attain asecond birth. Won’t you kindly tell us about them? Do give us your know-ledge and advice in one of the numbers of  Young  India.  Please
 help us by giving an account of the method of praying and working by which a
 
 man can recreate himself.
 The question refers to the eternal duel that is so graphically described in the Mahabharata under the cloak of history and that is every day going on in millions of breasts. Man’s destined purpose is to conquer old habits, to overcome the evil in him and to restore good to its rightful place. If religion does not teach us how to achieve this conquest, it teaches us nothing. But there is no royal road to success in this the truest enterprise in life. Cowardice is perhaps the greatest vice from which we suffer and is also possibly the greatest violence, cer- tainly far greater than bloodshed and the like that generally go under the name of violence. For it comes from want of faith in God and ignorance of His attributes. But I am sorry that I have not the ability to give “the knowledge and the advice” that the correspondent would have me to give on how to dispel cowardice and other vices. But I can give my own testimony and say that a heartfelt prayer is undoubtedly the most potent instrument that man possesses for overcoming cowar- dice and all other bad old habits. Prayer is an impossibility without a living faith in the presence of God within.
 Christianity and Islam describe the same process as a duel between God and Satan, not outside but within; Zoroastrianism as a duel between Ahurmazd and Ahriman; Hinduism as a duel between forces of good and forces of evil. We have to make  our  choice whether we should ally ourselves with the forces of evil or with the forces of good. And to pray to God is nothing but that sacred alliance between God and man whereby he attains his deliverance from the clutches of the prince of darkness. But a heartfelt prayer is not a recitation with the lips. It is a yearning from within which expresses itself in every word, every act, nay, every thought of man. When an evil thought successfully assails him, he may know that he has offered but alip prayer and similarly with regard to an evil word escaping his lips or an evil act done by him. Real prayer is an absolute shield and protection against this trinity of evils. Success does not always attend the very first effort at such real living prayer. We have  to  strive  against ourselves, we have to believe in spite of ourselves, because months are as our years. We have therefore to cultivate illimitable pati- ence if we will realize the efficacy of prayer. There will be dark-ness, disappointment and even worse, but we must have courage en-ough to battle against all these and not succumb to cowardice. There is no such thing as retreat for a man of prayer.
 What I am relating is not a fairytale. I have not drawn an imaginary picture. I have summed up the testimony of men who have by prayer conquered every difficulty in their upward progress, and I have added my own humble testimony that the more I live the more I realize how much I owe to faith and prayer which is one and the same thing for me. And I am quoting an experience not limited to a few hours, or days or weeks, but extending over an unbroken period of nearly 40 years. I have had my share of disappointments, uttermost darkness, counsels of despair, counsels of caution, subtlest assaults of pride; but I am able to say that my faith—and I know that it is still little enough, by no means as great as I want it to be—has ultimately conquered every one of these difficulties up to now. If we have faith in us, if we have a prayerful heart, we may not tempt God, may not make terms with Him. We must reduce ourselves to a cipher. Barodadalibtech_601_footnotelibtech_602_footnotesent me a precious Sanskrit verse not long before his death. It means impliedly that a man of devotion reduces himself to zero. Not until we have reduced ourselves to nothingness can we conquer the evil in us. God demands nothing less than complete self-surrender as the price for the only real freedom that is worth having. And when  a man thus loses himself, he immediately finds himself in the service of all that lives. It becomes his delight and his recreation. He is a new man never weary of spending himself in the service of God’s creation.

545,,DINABANDHU’S TRIBUTE,"
    
 Dinabandhu Andrews writes as follows from Manchester on Lalaji’s death:
 The  news  of  the  death  of  Lala  Lajpat  Rai  was  a  very  terrible shock to me for it was absolutely unexpected. I reached Birmingham very late on Saturday night and my brother told me about it. Since then I have referred to   it and made clear in the Manchester Guardian how great the loss must be both to India and to England, and indeed to the world of humanity; for he was the friend of the oppressed in every country and knew no racial barriers. What I am now waiting to hear is how far the death was caused by injuries received at the railway station at Lahoreat the time of the boycott of the Simon Commission. This is not at all made clear in the newspapers here, which are very guarded in
 
 their utterances, though there is just a hint about it.
 I may add that he cabled to me for correct news to which needless to say I sent a suitable reply.libtech_603_footnote

 LALAJI’S MEMORY
 With reference to my note on Dr. Satyapal’s telegramlibtech_604_footnotelibtech_605_footnotewhich was published in these columns, Lala Dunichand of Ambala writes :libtech_606_footnote
 The publication of Dr. Satyapal’s telegram in connection with Lala Lajpat Rai’s death in Young India of November 29, 1928 and your comments thereon have induced me to write this letter to you which I hope you will be able to publish. I am one of those who had been devoted to Lalaji for nearly all their life and it was only during the last elections that serious and even acute differences had arisen between him and myself.       But the blows received by
 him at the hands of the police and his death shortly after that have naturally and rightly changed altogether my mental attitude towards him and his work. .
 . . Now I look upon the sum total of his life-work too great to let me entertain any kind of ill will and his life too sacred to be remembered with anything but feelings of genuine respect. I feel as if quite a different kind of relations have sprung up between him and myself after his death. If the question of our differences with him is viewed in this light, we who differed from him and those who differed from us on account of him can again become comrades in the fight for winning freedom for our country.
This is undoubtedly the correct attitude to take and I hope that
 everybody who had some differences of opinion with Lalaji will adopt the same attitude and work for the common cause.
 INDIA’S AMBASSADRESS IN AMERICA
 The readers of Young India will be glad to share with me the following letterlibtech_607_footnotelibtech_608_footnotefrom Mr. R. E. Hume, son of Dr. R. A.  Hume of Nagar, regarding the fine work that is now being done  by  Devi Sarojini Naidu in America:
 
 You will be pleased, I am sure, to receive this message concerning the successful start of our friend Mrs. Sarojini Naidu in her visit to the United States.
 I heard her at her first appearance in New York city. And I have been testifying that I have never heard either from man or from woman the equal of her platform performance for the beauty and flow of English diction and for the structure and sequence of English sentences. . . .
 However, more beautiful and significant than the grammatical structure of English sentences were the beauty and goodness and truth of her utterances.   I rejoice that Mother India is being presented to America in the person of this charming and potent woman, who is perceiving the spiritual side of American life, and who is similarly conveying to the people here the spiritual side of the Indian people. But I am especially happy thus to report to you promptly
 the very successful realization of your plan for Mrs. Naidu to visit the United States as an ambassadress from the women and people of India.
 AJMAL JAMIA FUND
 A Mussalman friend asks the following questions and asks me to reply to them in Young India:
 I read Young India with intense interest especially the news of Islam. But I am puzzled to hear some undesired news about Ajmal Jamia. Will you kindly reply to the following queries and oblige me?
 On 	what principle is 	the Jamia being carried on?  Whether 	it is solely 	for Mussalmans 	or the members 	of every 	caste and creed 	are admitted 	into it?  If 	they are 	also admitted, 	how do 	they manage 	for their 	boarding, lodging, etc.?  How 	many and who are the members 	of the 	managing body, 	is there 	any other 	than Mussalmans upon it?  The 	Fund which is 	being collected 	by you 	is handed 	over to the institution 	or is still with you? If it is still with you, when do you intend to use it and 
how?
Here are the answers:
 The Jamia is carried on, on the broadest principles. The corres- pondent should study the constitution a copy of which he will get upon application to the authorities in Delhi.
 It is in practice solely and naturally for Mussalmans, but mem- bers of every caste and creed are freely admitted.
 I believe that such students have to make their own boarding arrangements.
 Sheth Jamnalalji is one of the trustees. The others are Mussal- mans.
 The Fund is in the possession of Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj who is the treasurer.

 To a national worker who has been ordered off to far away Orissa where at present cholera is raging, Gandhiji writes:
 And do not be afraid   of  cholera.  .  .  .libtech_611_footnotelibtech_612_footnoteobserve  proper  pre- cautions.	libtech_613_footnotelibtech_614_footnoteIf in spite of all precautions the worst befalls, there is no

 To another struggling soul he writes:
 With the help of Rama we have got to overcome the ten-headed Ravana of passions within us. Success is bound to be ours if we have faith in Rama and surrender ourselves to His grace. Above all do not lose self-confidence. Avoid indulgence of the palate.
 
 
 To another he says:
 There  is  a  world  of  difference between  spinning  for sacrifice and spinning for recreation. I would advise you to observe a religious silence while spinning. It would give you spiritual peace and if you make it a point always to spin at a particular fixed hour, it will automatically regulate your other appointments too and help you to a well-ordered life.
 To still another he writes:
 You may not force the wearing of khadi on your mother if she is unwilling. But if your faith in khadi is genuine and strong enough it is bound to prove infectious.
 To another correspondent again:
 My sovereign panacea (for communal troubles) is well known. If either of the parties were completely to purge itself of ill will and patiently bear any injustice that the other side might inflict, a real heart unity between the two was bound to be established in the end. The injustice would come to an end and both sides would become brave. Today they are pitiful cowards.

549,,KHADI IN HYDERABAD STATE,"
    
 At a Co-operative Conference held the other day in the Hyderabad State, the Finance Minister, Sir Hyder Nawaz Jung Baha- dur, delivered an address from which a friend sends me the following translation of his reference to the spinning-wheel:
 But the most important thing to which I wish to draw your attention is our home industries. To preserve and help them is the supreme duty of co-operative societies. If co-operative societies could be organized to distribute domestic implements and raw materials amongst the people, it would be a great boon to the country. For the sake of illustration, I would mention spinning and weaving. If they could be revived in our towns and villages, it would be a great achievement. Quite till the other day, spinning and weaving were commonly practised in our homes. Not only in the huts of the poor but also in the homes of the rich and well-to-do, young girls and their matrons used to utilize their leisure time by spinning; and a variety of things for household use, like carpets, sheets, coverlets, table-cloths, etc., were prepared out of the yarn thus spun. Respectable widows who have no other means of livelihood used to support themselves and their children by spinning and sewing. By popularizing this occupation, you would not only augment the slender resources of the people but by providing them with useful work for
 filling their spare time save them from falling a prey to many a temptation. I hope that the energetic officials of our Department will make a beginning in this direction this year. I shall carefully go through the next year’s report to see how many of us have taken to this good work. libtech_616_footnote
 We should never forget that man isolated from society is but an animal. He rises to his full estate which has been described as ‘little less than the angels’ only through mutual aid and co-operation with his fellow-beings. So long as you stand apart, self-sufficing units, so long as ‘I’ am ‘I’ and ‘you’ are ‘you’, we are only glorified animals called men. When ‘I’ and ‘you’ combine to form ‘we’ we develop a divine force and the process of developing this force is spelt co-operation.
I congratulate the Minister on his pronouncement and trust that
 the State of Hyderabad will compete with that of Mysore in the spread of the spinning-wheel. Co-operation in spinning is easy and an indis- pensable thing if khadi is to be placed on a stable basis. A hand-spinning co-operative society will start with a cotton depot where bag cotton, not pressed cotton, will be stored for converting into cards. It will have carders, if the spinners do not themselves card in the initial stages. This depot will keep the necessary furniture, i.e., hand-gins, carding-bows, spinning-wheels, accessories and necessary tools with facility for repairs. The depot will be a distributing, receiving and selling depot and will distribute cotton or slivers as the case may be. It will receive against cash-payment yarn spun by the members and sell to the members khadi woven from their yarn or bought from other places. It will sell khadi at special prices to the spinning members and at ordinary prices to the public. If such societies are formed under State patronage and with State aid, partial or in full, there is really no limit to the possibilities of mass co-operation. Only this presupposes a khadi atmosphere among the officials; in other words, the officials must be converts, lovers and trustees of the masses, not their lords and masters, for whom the masses are born to toil and sweat on starvation wages. If the Finance Minister infects his officials with the zeal which his address shows there is a great future for the people of the State. And Hyderabad unlike Mysore is a vast cotton area.

 You have all set out to become expert spinners, weavers and car- ders. But that is not enough. Every turn of the spinning-wheel, every throw of the shuttle, every stroke on the cardingbow should awaken a responsive echo in your soul. The task that lies before you is tremendous. You have to reach and establish a living contact with not a few hundred, not a few thousand but millions of the poor that are scattered over the seven lakhs of villages in India. Till that work is accomplished you dare not rest. Then, if you want really to serve the country you must keep your bodies and minds pure so as to make of yourselves a fit instrument for carrying out His work. If you awake every morning with His name on your lips and invoke His aid to help you in your struggles during the day and at night time before retiring take stock of the day’s failures and lapses, make a confession of them to your Maker and do a sincere penance for them—the only fitting penance for a lapse is to make a firm resolve not to allow it to happen again—you will thereby build, as it were, a solid wall of protection round you and gradually temptations will cease to assail you.
 In the end whilst I shall always recall this period of my stay in your midst with joy and satisfaction, my feeling is not free from a regret; and that is, that in spite of my being in your midst for all these days I have not been able to play with the children of the Ashram, to know them individually by their names, to win their  personal friendship and confidence as I would have liked to do. But what could I do? I was so hard pressed by work.

555,"December 20, 1928",INTERVIEW AT NAGPUR STATIONlibtech_623_footnote,"
    
 December 20, 1928
 [QUESTION]: What would be your attitude towards a political war of independence?
 [ANSWER]: I would decline to take part in it just as I would refuse to support the British Government in any war that it might engage in tomorrow.
 But in South Africa you supported an alien Government in its war against the Boers, although it was at that time oppressing the Indians; again in 1914 you supported the British Government in its War against Germany. How is the situation altered since then that you should refuse to support your own country in a war of independence?
The situation today is radically different for me from what it was
 at the time of the Boer War or the War in 1914. On both the occasions  I was a believer in the Empire. I thought that in spite of its lapses the sum total of its activity was beneficial to the world. And though I was against war at that time as I am now, I had no status or strength to refuse to participate in war. I suppressed my private judgment in favour of the duty of an ordinary citizen. My position is wholly diffe- rent now. I have become by force of circumstances a teacher of non- violence. I claim to enforce my teaching in my own life to the best of my ability and I feel that I have the strength to resist war in my own person.
 Then you would not support a national militia?
 I would support the formation of a militia under swaraj if only because I realize that people cannot be made non-violent by compulsion. Today I am teaching the people how to meet a national crisis by non- violent means. But it is one thing to adopt non-violence for a specific purpose in a time of crisis, and quite another thing to advocate its adoption by all for all time as a philosophy of life. Not that I consider such adoption to be impossible. But I lack the strength for such a mission. I may not therefore resist the formation of a
 
 national militia. Only I cannot join it myself. I feel quite clearly within me that a militia is unnecessary but I have not the word that would carry convic-tion to others.
 If that be your view, surely you would like our youth to avail themselves of the University Training Corps that have been organized by some universities?
To receive military training under the present Government is to
 train yourself into a limb of the present system, a limb that is liable to be used against your own people at any time. A Gurkha is an Indian, blood of our blood and bone of our bone, yet he would shoot his own countrymen when ordered to do so.
 But our young men will be educated people, they will never consent to do such an unpatriotic act?
 You are welcome to that belief if you like but let me tell you that you are living in a fool’s paradise. You little realize the demoralizing effect of environment. How many people can you point out in the country today, who having gone under the Government’s influence have been able to escape from its hypnotic spell and to keep their independence intact. The British rulers know the workings of human nature. They know that a vast majority of men when they come under a system conform to it especially when it is  full  of promise for self-aggrandizement. There are educated Indians enough in the Gove-rnment employ who do the will of their masters even though it may be, as it often is, against national interest. And you do not seem to attach any importance to the fact that the young men who join the corps have to take the oath of allegiance.

 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 The fact that you did not get a letter on Sunday means that Kanti is not there. He wanted me to write a personal letter to him, which I wrote and enclosed yours in the same cover. This time there has not been a single day without my writing a letter to you. I can leave you without one  only  when  all  your  worries  disappear  and the atmosphere there becomes completely purified. I certainly yearn for a time when I need not write letters to anyone in the Ashram. Such a day will also come. At present, to write letters is no burden to me.
For the Orissa matter you will have to write to Vallabhbhai.
 Indu Parekh should go to Calicut or stay in Bardoli. He should stop his studies completely.
 Umi must now be out of danger. You need not worry even if she is suffering from pneumonia. The treatment for both is the same, rest and hot water. If she feels hungry, give her milk and fruit juice. I shall write a detailed reply later.

 I have only one request to make to you and  all  others concerned, and that is that whatever days of life on this earth are now left to me, they should be utilized for advancing what I regard as the most fruitful work of my life—and that is khadi—and not frittered away for mere demonstrations. You are at liberty to hold your own view as to what the most fruitful activity of my life is but then you should leave me alone.
 Referring to the deepening poverty of the country, he said:
 
 While on the one hand the Government is despoiling the coun- try by an evergrowing burden of taxation, the trader is mulcting it yearly of 60 crores of rupees by dumping foreign cloth on it. Is it any wonder that between the upper millstone of taxation and the nether one of exploitation the masses are being ground to powder? In fact it would be a surprise if things were otherwise.
 He then went on to describe how three great leaders to whom Utkal owed a deep debt of gratitude, namely, the late Deshbandhu, the late Lalaji and  the  late Gopabandhu Das had in their lifetime affirmed an unequivocal faith in khadi as a means for village reconstruction and combating poverty of the Indian masses and how that faith had grown and deepened as they approached the end of their earthly journey. The only way in which Utkal could do justice to their memory was by taking to khadi in right earnest and insuring Utkal against the ravages of nature and of man by its means. Sambalpur had vast potential resources for khadi work in its weaving population. What he therefore wanted of them was to convert Sambalpur into a flourishing khadi centre.

  	After finishing the work at a meeting,libtech_626_footnoteI  had  my  meal  and  am now working at the 	spinning-wheel. I have some quiet time and so have sat down to reply 	to your letter which was received here. I had kept aside the other 	letters with the intention of replying to them in detail. You may, 	therefore, expect a reply to every point.  	So far I have been able to keep to third-class travel, and all of us 	have been travelling in great comfort. From Nagpur, we were given 	one section of the carriage, the label “reserved” put on it, so 	that we experienced no difficulty on the way.  	In the meeting here, I sold khadi to my heart’s content. There are 	a number of Gujaratis here. They gave more than eight hundred 	rupees. I expect that they will make up one thousand before I leave 	this place. The untouchables here gave me self-spun yarn and also 	khadi woven by themselves.  	The question of agency was discussed in the meeting of the Spinners’ 	Association. I did not have to sit through it. But I had liked    
 your suggestion in principle and, therefore, pressed it at the meeting. All the members have approved of it. It has now been finally decided that, if we are to keep the agency, it will be not in the name of an individual but in the name of the institution. They may let the agency remain with the institution so long as they are satisfied with its work. I have told them that if they find some other arrangements more convenient, they may certainly make it, and that, if they do so, it will not displease me or any of us. The committee should do fearlessly what they find, on an objective consideration of the matter, to be in the best interest of khadi. A subcommittee has been appointed to take a final decision, and it will do so and inform us. Narandas is included in that committee. The matter will be settled in a few days.
 The Mandir will get some money for the expenses which are incurred for Devdas and others. You should pay Devdas’s bills. If you have anything to say with regard to the actual figures of expenditure, you may draw my attention to them or make a suggestion directly to Devdas.
 Mirabehn and Chhotelal have stayed back in Wardha. Mirabehn will return to the Ashram after completing the work she has started in Bihar. Chhotelal will go to Bombay in a few days and return to the Ashram after learning some details there about bee-keeping. It has been decided that he should finally return there. All the same, it will be good if you and Gangabehn keep up your efforts to attract him there. I suppose those two have gone out to Savali to see the work being done there. Chhotelal gained five pounds in Wardha. Vasu- mati’s weight, too, has gone up and is still increasing. She has gained nearly eight pounds at least. The causes for the increase in the weight of both are oil and mental peace.
 Umi must have recovered now. In whooping cough the most important remedy is proper nursing. And we hear of more and more instances of the wonderful effect of sun-bath. This field, of restoring health through the sun, has hardly been explored so far; all the facts about the power of its rays have not been fully investigated yet. I for one believe that innumerable diseases can be cured mainly through different treatments with the sun’s rays. Revashankerbhai’s Dhiru recovered through such treatment. One of his bones was infected from within. About one pound of pus used to flow out every day. He has now recovered completely through treatment with the sun’s rays. Hence complaints like weakness, cough, getting out of breath with the slightest exertion, etc., can certainly be cured by treatment with the sun’s rays.
Kishorelal, too, has come to Wardha. But I may say that as he
 
 arrived I left. We could, therefore, have no talk. His health may be described as so so. I keep very well. Keshu’s low fever has gone and he has gained 4_ pounds in weight.

 FOR LOVERS OF SPINNING
 With reference to the articlelibtech_633_footnotelibtech_634_footnotewhich suggests that ginned cotton need not be dried in the sun before carding, Shri Lakshmidas writes:libtech_635_footnote
 This important suggestion has been made, thanks to a mistake I had made out of ignorance. I have now come to realize the distinction between kapas (unginned cotton) and ru (ginned cotton); however, before acquiring that knowledge I had used the two terms as synon- ymous. Hence, in the article mentioned above, I happened to write kapas instead of ru. In this manner, good results come out of innocent mistakes.

 I have your letter. You should not mind Shankerbhai having written you that letter. It expresses his anger and his frankness. The anger will subside, let us cherish his frankness. At every step you should learn something. You will succeed in your task only if you become a cipher. No one will judge you by a low standard. Swallow all bitter pills; if you do, your body and mind will be as strong as copper.
 You did the right thing in arranging for Manjulla to stay in the town. We certainly cannot request a car every day. I have had full ex- perience of Ranchhodbhai’s goodness. I am, therefore, not surprised
 
 to learn that he himself comes with the car every day. Tell him that I would have been surprised if he had not done that.
 There was nothing about the children in your letter. I believe, therefore, that they are improving. Do not take even a seemingly dangerous illness as really so. Never become panicky. We know a most effective remedy. Whether it is children or grown-ups who are ill, give them nothing except water make the nature of illness is not known.

You 	women should learn a lesson from the death of Umi. All the children 	of the Ashram are the children of all of you. If any of them dies, 	take it that God has taken it away. If new ones are    
 born, take it that God has sent them to you. Even if new births do not add to the number of children in the Ashram, the coming of new families add to their number.

  	You are being tested well. Since it is natural for you to feel pain 	at the loss of Umilibtech_643_footnoteit 	should of course be so regarded. But we have been trying to forget 	the habit of grieving over the loss of our dear ones. why should we 	grieve when we know that union is bound to end      
 in separation? We feel it natural to grieve because we have got into that habit. There are certain communities which do not  feel  so. Among the Muslims death causes the least grief. Grief over death is thus not a universal rule. It does of course seem to be regarded as natural by the Hindus. Being contrary to the teaching of the Gita, the habit needs to be given up. the first chapter refers to the difference we make between our people and other people. Shri Krishna abolishes that distinction. In the Ashram we have been trying to forget it. You should regard your present misfortune as an occasion for succeeding in our attempt. To whom do the children in the Ashram belong? Loving those children and serving them, you will not feel the loss of Umi and the strength of worldly desires in you will diminish.

574,"December 	26, 1928","SPEECH ON RESOLUTION ON NEHRU REPORT, CALCUTTA
		CONGRESS— I libtech_645_footnote","
       December 	26, 1928  Mahatma 	Gandhi in an introductory speech delivered in Hindustani before 	moving the resolution said that the gravity of the situation 	demanded that he should also put his views before the country. 	Although he liked to speak in Hindustani, circumstances demanded 	that he should move the resolution in English. Pandit Jawaharlal 	Nehru then read out the text of the resolution.  	This Congress having considered the constitution recom- mended by 	the All-Parties Committee Reportlibtech_646_footnotewelcomesit as a great contribution towards the 	solution of India’s political and communal problems and 	congratulates the Committee on the virtual unanimity of its 	recommendations and whilst adhering to the resolution relating to 	Complete Independence passed at the Madras Congress adopts the 	constitution drawn up by the Comm-ittee as a great step in political 	advance, specially as it represents the largest measure of agreement 	attained among the important parties in the country, provided 	however that the Con- gress shall not be bound by the constitution, 	if it is not accepted     
 on or before the 31st December 1930 and provided further that in the event of non-acceptance by the British Parliament of the constitution by that date the Congress will revive non-violent non-co-operation by advising the country to refuse taxation and every aid to the Government.
 The President is hereby authorized to send the text of this resolution together with a copy of the said report to His Excell- ency the Viceroy for such action as he may be pleased to take.
 Nothing in the resolution shall interfere with the propa- ganda for familiarizing the people with the goal of indepen- dence in so far as it does not conflict with prosecution of a campaign for the adoption of the said Report.libtech_647_footnote
 (2) Meanwhile the Congress shall engage in the following activities: (a) In the legislatures and outside every attempt will be made to bring about total prohibition of intoxicating drugs and drinks; picketing of liquor and drug shops shall be organized whereve desirable and possible. (b) Inside and outside legis- latures methods suited to respective environments shall be immediately adopted to bring about boycott of foreign cloth by advocating and stimulating production and adoption of hand- spun and hand-woven khaddar. (c) Specific grievances, wher- ever discovered and where people are ready, shall be sought to be redressed by non-violent action as was recently done at Bardoli.
 (d) Members of legislatures returned on Congress tickets shall devote the bulk of their time to the constructive  work  settled from time to time by the Congress Committee. (e) Congress organizations shall be perfected by enlisting members and enforcing strictest discipline. (f) Measures shall be taken to rid the country of social abuses. (g) Measures shall be taken to remove disabilities of women and they will be invited and encouraged to take their due share in national upbuilding (h) It will be the duty of all Congressmen, being Hindus, to do all they can to remove untouchability and help the so-called untoucha- bles in every possible way in their attempt to remove their disabilities and better their condition. (i) Volunteers shall be
 
 
 enlisted to take up village reconstruction in addition to what is being done through the spinning-wheel and khaddar. (j) Such other work as may be deemed advisable in order to advance nation-building in all its departments and in order to enable the Congress to secure co-operation in national efforts of the people engaged in different pursuits. In order to finance the activities mentioned in the foregoing programme every Congressman with a monthly income of Rs. 100 and over shall contribute five per cent of his monthly income provided that in special cases exemption may be granted at the discretion of the Working Committee.libtech_648_footnote
 Continuing, Mahatmaji said:
 Friends, I hope I shall not detain you for many minutes in my introductory remarks. It is an open secret that we have in our camp sharp differences of opinion as to the lead Congressmen  should receive in connection with the epoch-making Report. I call it an epoch-making Report of the All-Parties Constitution Committee. We have the Delhi resolutionlibtech_649_footnotelibtech_650_footnoteand  the   first  thing  that  strikes  anybody would be why not affirm or reaffirm the Delhi resolution dealing with this question.If it could have been done consistently with national interest there would have been an end to all new resolutions and cer- tainly I would not have troubled you. I must take you in confi-dence and tell you that the President himself felt that the Delhi resolution re- quired rethinking and revision. Some of us putting our heads together came to the conclusion that the Delhi resolution was a self-con- tradictory resolution. So we cast about to find a middle path so that consistently with honesty and with desire to accept the Nehru Report we should frame another resolution. This resolution is the result of it. Even as it is, this resolution is an attempt to satisfy and if not to satisfy at least to conciliate those schools of thought that are prevailing in the Congress with regard to the Report. That we have two schools of thought is no matter of misfortune or grief.
 I suggest to you that the purpose of Congressmen should be to adopt the Nehru Report in the same spirit in which it was received by the whole of India at the time it was published. Let me recall to you that at the time of its publication it was not only enthusiastically
 
 It reiterated the demand for Complete Independence and accepted the Nehru Committee recommendations for the settlement of communal differences.
 received by the nation but it commanded, it extorted, the unstinted admiration of our critics, of our opponents and of outsiders who were disinterested spectators. It is, if you choose to do so, open to you to say that we shall not accept the Report, but I say it would be bad if we came to such a conclusion hastily. But if after the first flash of enthusiasm had died out and after a careful study of the Report we come to the conclusion that the best interests of the nation will not be served by accepting the Report, it would be your bounden duty, though painful, to reject it. I suggest to you either we should give our wholehearted support or we should not support it at all. It is a docu- ment which is not an end in itself but the beginning of the end. It is a document which is designed to bring together as many important parties as it is possible with a view to concentrating their attention and efforts upon some common purpose in connection with our political advance.
 When the Committee approached its labours you must know that the horizon was dark. I know myself there were tremendous diffi- culties and there was a time when there was nothing but despair staring the members in the face, but Dr. Ansari and your President were not men who would give in easily to despair. They fought the tide of despair and how successfully you know and the world knows.
 You the Congressmen are the authors of this Convention and in the same breath that you adopted complete national independence as your goal you asked the Working Committee to have the Convention of all parties with a view to framing a scheme of swaraj as I call it or call it a  constitution  that  would  be  acceptable  to  the  majority of  the parties and you had a committee consisting of the most eminent men in the country known for their services to the country and you imposed on Congressmen the labours of bringing together all these men and getting them to go as near the Congress goal as they could possibly do. This must have been in your minds at the time you thought of the Convention, and at the time of asking the Working Committee to call a Convention into being.
 That being so I suggest that unless there are overwhelming reasons for you not to accept the Report, it must be accepted by you. You cannot take this Report piecemeal or chop it up, for it is an organic whole. Just as you cannot chop a body and say I will have so much of the body and will not have the other half, so you do not chop this Report and say you will accept this part and not the other one. As Dr. Ansari has pointed out if you attack the central theme of the Report you stab the heart itself and the centre is what is known as Dominion Status. I suggest to you that it will be a grievous blunder to Independence against Dominion Status or compare the two and
 
 suggest that Dominion Status carries humiliation with it and that Independence is something that is triumphant. I do not want to go into the controversy just now. I simply say to you as a  man  of  business wanting to serve the nation, wanting to educate the masses and influence the masses and desiring to enlist active co-operation of the masses in order to vindicate the honour of the nation. I suggest if you seek to do all these things you will think fifty times before you will go to the masses and compare these two things. Don’t run to the hasty conclusion that the distinguished authors of the Report had the interest of the country less at their heart than any of us, or most of us. Do not run away with the hasty conclusion that they want anything else than Complete Indepen-dence for the country. The word ‘independence’ is much abused and is an equally misunderstood word. The contents of that word would vary with the strength that the nation can call to its aid from time to to time. (“Hear, hear.”) Independence of Nepal is not attained in the same way as independence of America. Then there is independence of  the feudatory States—they flatter themselves sometimes with the belief that they are independent and they are sometimes called semi-independent States—they adopt the role  of independence  in their relations with their subjects. That is a species of independence. Let us not therefore make too much of that one word and let us not belittle the other two words (Dominion Status). I as a tried worker, as one who knows something of the masses, desire to warn you against confusing the mind of the nation. For you will simply entrap them and leave them in trap holes. Beware of doing any such thing.
 I suggest that the utmost that a man desires—independence— has been given to him by this resolution. The Madras resolution gives you the goal of the Congress. It tells you that Independence shall be the goal, but it has not declared independence. You are not now working for independence of the type that the authors of that reso- lution had in their mind. In one way we are all striving for indepen- dence. The Congress creed is the creed of independence. I challenge anybody to deny that. That is the process of evolution, but some of us consider that we should have the word ‘independence’ incorporated in the same resolution of the Congress so that we can put it before the nation. By all means have it, keep that word; but in considering this resolution I desire to tell you that, in the process of working, the very pace of independence is accelerated by it and not retarded. You might have easily slept over the goal you set before yourselves in Madras. But here by this resolution you dare not sleep over your goal; for at the end of two years you will have to work out your independence and practically you will have to declare indepen-dence. Some of us,
 and I include myself among them if I survive two years, may have to die in order to give a good account of ourselves for the sake of achieving independence and it may be till it is achieved, you will have to see our carcases. I yield to none in my desire to attain completest independence. So long as there is any one man who can interfere with my freedom or with the nation’s freedom it is intolerable and I con- sider that I live in vain. The fire of independence is burning within me as much as in the most fiery breast of anyone in the country but the ways and methods may differ and it may be that when I am nearing my destiny on this earth you may say, ‘For independence we may wait for fifty years’. If it is so, you will tell me and point out that I am weakened and you will then not listen to me but hiss me out of the Congress platform. And I shall consider myself unworthy to serve the nation. I want to dedicate what little strength I may have to the nation and not my weakness. For my weakness I shall answer before my Maker. For my strength it is all at your disposal. Do not run away with the idea for a single moment that I want to suggest anything less than what the nation can have today or what the nation should have tomorrow. Therefore I suggest that if really you want to work out the resolution of the Madras Congress for Independence you have got the amplest possible scope in this resolution but with one Supreme condition that having called the Convention into being you must be faithful to that Report as you will be faithful to your goal.
 I would ask you to interpret that Report in terms of that goal and feel that the authors of that Report have also the goal of Indepen- dence in view and remember that the Chairman of that Committee which brought out the Report is the President of your Congress. I do not want to dissect this resolution at this stage but I want you to dismiss, in considering this resolution, all personal factors. I do not want you to become my patron. I want you to treat me as a comrade marching side by side with you and I also want you to outbid me in the march towards the goal. You may say, ‘Doctors have ordered rest for you, you can take well-deserved rest, we shall run and if you march side by side with us we may have to crawl.’ I say crawling we have buried in that wretched lane at Amritsar. We shall never crawl. I do not ask you to consider this resolution in any patronizing spirit, nor does your President stand in need of any patronage. I can swallow patronage, but not he. Eliminate therefore all considerations and make your own choice.
 The Report is merely the commencement of the end. There is a lot of work to be done to achieve the purpose behind it. There is much spade-work even in this Congress. The Muslim League, Hindu Mahasabha and every other organization has got to do its duty before
 we can launch out that Report upon the wide ocean. It is necessary for you to chalk out a resolution which will satisfy all needs of that Report and not merely say: ‘All right, we accept the Report lest anybody should be offended or in order that diplomats may go on with diplo- macy and steal something for us.’ It will not come by stealing. Free- dom has never come by stealing. It has come by bleeding and you will have to bleed even for getting what is attempted in that Report.
 I therefore want you to accept that Report whole-heartedly with the fixed determination to work for that goal. I do not want to wash down your goal. I want you to sustain your goal. If you wish you may misinterpret it or interpret it in any other way. I hope you  will approach consideration of this resolution in a national spirit and if I may also say in a prayerful spirit.

 I am deeply obliged to you for your letter of 28th Novemberlibtech_655_footnote(in reply to my telegram and letter) and also for the valuable comments made by you thereon in Young India.
 I wish to assure you that every word of that telegram is heartfelt and sincere and is not prompted by any momentary impulse and interested reason, or any outward pressure. The passing away of Lala Lajpat Rai throws a very
 heavy burden of responsibilities on the shoulders of the nationalist workers and they cannot afford to have any split in that camp. . .
 One point however I want to make quite clear. I have not been able to appreciate the idea of your finding ‘repentance’ on our part in that telegram. I have read the telegram several times over and still have not been able to find any words which signify any repentance on my part for my having opposed Lala Lajpat Rai during his lifetime when I felt it necessary to do so. . . .
 I pay my heartfelt tribute to the memory of Lala Lajpat Rai but that does not mean that I subscribe to everything he advocated or championed. . . .

576,,CURSE OF ASSASSINATION,"
  
 The assassinationlibtech_656_footnoteof the Assistant Superintendent Mr. Saunders of Lahore was a dastardly act apart from whether it had a political motive behind it or not. Violence being in the air, there will no doubt be silent and secret approbation of the act, especially if it is discovered to have had any connection with the assault on Lalaji and his utterly innocent comrades. The provocation was great and it became doubly great by the death of Lalaji which was certainly hastened by the nervous shock received by him from the disgraceful conduct of the police. Some will insist, not without considerable justification, on ascribing the death even to the physical effect of the injury received by the deceased in the region of the heart. The provocation received also additional strength from the Punjab Government’s defence of the police conduct. I should not wonder if the assassination proves to be in revenge of the high-handed policy of the Punjab Government.
 I wish however that it was possible to convince the hot youth of the utter futility of such revenge. Whatever the Assistant Superinten- dent did was done in obedience to instructions. No one person can be held wholly responsible for the assault and the aftermath. The fault is that of the system of Government. What requires mending is not men but the system. And when the youth of the country have the real determination they will find that it is in their power as it is in nobody else’s to kill the system.
 English books have taught us to applaud as heroic deeds of daring, even of freebooters, villains, pirates and train-wreckers. News- papers fill columns with exciting stories real or, in their absence, im- aginary, of such deeds. Some of us have successfully learnt this art of applauding as heroic anything adventurous irrespective of the motives or contemplated results behind such deeds.
 This cannot be regarded as anything but a bad omen. Surely there is nothing heroic about a cold-blooded robbery accompanied by murder of an innocent wealthy pilgrim carrying treasures for dis- tribution in well-conceived charity. There is equally none in the deliberate secret assassination of an innocent police officer who has discharged his duty however disagreeable its consequences may be for the community to which the assassin belongs. Let us remember that the administrators of the system have held on to the system in spite of previous assassinations. After all the story of the building of the  British Empire is not itself wanting in deeds of valour, adventure and
 
 sacrifice worthy, in my opinion, of a better cause. If we may regard the assassination of Mr. Saunders as a heroic deed the British people would be able to answer this one, I hope, solitary act of so-called heroism with countless such acts enough to fill a volume. But it is time we  began  irrespective  of   nationalities   to   regard   deeds   with mean motives or meaner consequences with nothing but horror, indignation and disapprobation, no matter how daring they may be. I know that this means a new valuation of such terms as heroism, patriotism, religiousness and the like. No one, I hope, regards the assassinations of Presidents Clevelandlibtech_657_footnotelibtech_658_footnoteand Carnotlibtech_659_footnoteas reflecting any credit upon the assassins or the nations in whose cause the mad men carried out their evil plans. Islam is not better for the assassination of so many Caliphs or, to take a modern instance, for the assassination of the late Swami Shraddhanandji. Nor has Hinduism been ennobled by the frenzied deeds one occasionally reads about  of  so-called  protectors of the cow. The curse of assassination and kindred crimes is not advancing the progress to humanity, religion or true civilization.
 Let the youth of India realize that the death of Lalaji can only be avenged by regaining her freedom. Freedom of a nation cannot be won by solitary acts of herosim even though they may be of the true type, never by heroism so-called. The temple of freedom requires the patient, intelligent, and constructive effort of tens of thousands of men and women, young and old. Acts such as we are deploring decidedly retard the progress of this quiet building. When it does nothing else, it diverts the attentions of countless builders.

578,,578. A SINDH CURSE,"
 The Amils of Sindh are probably the most advanced community in that province. But in spite of all their advance, there are some serious abuses of which they seem to have a monopoly. Of these the custom of  deti-letilibtech_661_footnoteis not the least serious. I have more than  once remarked upon it in these columns. My attention was drawn to this abuse during my very first visit to Sindh and I was invited to speak to the Amil friends about it. Though no doubt isolated work has been done in the direction of removing this abuse, no organized effort seems to have been made to end the evil. The Amils are a compact little community. The seriousness of the evil is not questioned by anybody. I have not known a single Amil to defend the vile custom. It has persisted because it is a custom patronized by the educated youth among the Amils. Their mode of life is above the means they can honestly command. Hence they have thrown all scruples to the wind and do not mind degrading themselves by prostituting the institution of marriage for their own base ends. And this one vicious habit has told upon the quality of their national work which otherwise by their intellect and education they are capable of doing to the great benefit of the country.
 In order to put an end to this evil, a provisional committee has already been formed now of which Acharya A. T. Gidwani has accepted the presidentship. This is as it should be. When he undertook to go to Sindh from Brindaban it was naturally expected that he would throw himself with zest into all desirable movements that conduce to national well-being. It is to be hoped that the provisional committee will soon become a permanent organization and under his able leadership the reform which is already belated will make steady
 
 progress.
 The  Secretary,  Sjt.  Mirchandani,  asks  me  for  suggestions. The only suggestion that I can think of just now is that this organiza- tion should create a public opinion against deti-leti that would become irresistible. Your educated Amils are able to squeeze the poor parents of marriageable girls only because there is no active public opinion against the custom. There should be work done in the schools and colleges and amongst the parents of girls. The parents should so educate their daughters that they would refuse to marry a young man who wanted a price for marrying and would rather remain spinsters than be party to the degrading terms. The only honourable terms in marriage are mutual love and mutual consent.

579,,579. MILK FOR BOMBAY,"
 A friend on reading the article ‘A Blot on Bombay’ in Young India (29th November) writes to Mahadev Desai as follows:libtech_662_footnote
 I am afraid that the writer of the letter has misunderstood the article in question. No one has suggested that the question of the slaughter of cattle in Bombay or of the supply of pure milk will be solved by shifting the stables from the city of Bombay to the suburbs of Bombay. What is required and what has been suggested is that Bombay should bravely face the problem as behoves it. Surely the Gujaratis who are not living in Bombay are not the philanthropists who might be expected to come to the rescue of Bombay and solve one of its tremendous and equally urgent problems. The Municipality of Bombay has to take the initiative and make the move and if need be enlist the sympathy and co-operation of philanthropically-inclined Gujaratis. I fear that even if anybody outside Bombay wanted to come to the rescue, he would require special facilities from the Bombay Corporation. But we have not in this country the requisite capacity for private enterprise which would take great risks involved in a  big  venture that the supply of milk to a large city like Bombay undoubtedly is. Let it be also known that such private effort has been made before now in Bombay and it failed. I think that failure had definite causes. There was not sufficient grit and ability behind those ventures. But I submit that no cost is too great, no enterprise too risky for the Municipality of Bombay to undertake in order to ensure a supply of cheap and pure milk for its citizens and to rid Bombay of
 
 stables which are a source of danger to its health and which must be always coming in the way of any radical measure for dealing with malaria and other diseases which are rampant in Bombay. I freely admit that Bombay has to travel outside its radius for the organization of a vast dairy scheme. But that every city in the world has done for many of its wants.

	A LETTER","
                DEAR 	FRIEND,   AS 	AT SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM,  SABARMATI,  December 	27, 1928 
  	I have your letter received during Christmas week. I send you 	therefore my very best wishes.  	I welcome your questions. So long as we indirectly sustain a system 	and derive our own support from it, so long are we bound to    
 give it even direct support, unless we feel that the system being bad presents and effective opportunity for destroying it. The question when the opportunity is effective can only be determined in every individual case by one’s own strength of conviction and corres- ponding self-confidence. At the time of my participation in the Boer War and the late War, I saw neither the effective opportunity nor had I the confidence. Seeker after God which is Truth does not bother when the opportunity is effective or about self-confidence. God gives him the light when his time has come. All that man can do, is required to do, is to keep himself pure, humble to the extent of becoming a cipher in very truth. The light at the correct time is assured for him. Such a seeker confines himself to progessively narrow participation in a system in which he finds himself and from which he is too unable to extricate himself wholly at a bound.
 I think that the second question is partly if not wholly answered in the foregoing. I can only add that a silent prayer is often more effective than the spoken word consciously uttered. Therefore in irres- ponsive surroundings like those of the Wall Street a reliance must be placed exclusively upon silent prayer accompanied by the strictest uncompromising conduct.
 I am not absolutely sure of the European visit. But if I do go to Europe next year and if there is a call from within to go to America and if I have the time I would certainly go. But here again I am following my tried prescription within for light and guidance.
 Yours sincerely,

585,"December 	27, 1928",585. LETTER TO C. F. ANDREWSlibtech_665_footnote,"
       CALCUTTA, 
  December 	27, 1928  	Being in the midst of all turmoil I have not much time to send you a 	love letter much as I should like during this Christmas week. 	Tuckerlibtech_666_footnotehas 	been constantly with me  and  was  anxious  to  join  the morning 	prayer on Christmas day and give appropriate hymns, but could not as 	his friends failed him at the last moment. I 	am dictating this just for one thing, and that is Lalaji’s book.     
 After very careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that it is unnecessary just now to publish an abridgement of Unhappy India. Lalaji’s wish about the circulation of a thousand copies in Britain should be respected, not by presenting copies gratis to  anybody  except those who may want it but by keeping a stock there for sale. The third edition printed here is a well-got-up volume attractively bound. It may be sold even cheap. But it is the Indian copy which should be circulated there.
 I do not attach much importance to replies to Miss Mayo’s calumny, however able and true they may be, and certainly not much importance will be given in the West to an Indian contribution. What must however be done is to present the West with a very brief and attractive volume containing the life and selections from all Lalaji’s writings. Such a volume will illustrate the truth that the most forward nationalists of India have not been haters of the West or of England or in any other way narrow but that they have been internationalists  under the guise of nationalism. Such were Lalaji, Tilak, Das. I hardly need to mention many others. It may serve the cause of humanity if the truth can be brought out that the men who have been persecuted and practically done to death by this wicked Government had deser- ved a better fate.
I have perhaps not yet made absolutely clear what I want to say.
But I have no doubt you have understood it.
 Ba, Mahadev, Subbiah, Pyarelal, Krishnadas, Chhaganlal, Jamna- das, Keshu, Jamnalal and Rajagopalachari and several others whom you know intimately are with me.

	CONGRESS—II libtech_668_footnote","
  	Your letters come regularly. There are many Bombay friends 	travelling up and down. Some of them may escort you. I shall write 	to Mrityunjaya.  	I am very careful in conducting my experiment of taking oil. I shall 	give it up if it does any harm. Ba 	is slightly indisposed today.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 3317     December 	28, 1928  When 	Pandit Motilal called upon Mahatma Gandhi to 	move the 	new resolution a 	member objected to 	this procedure 	so long 	as the 	original resolutionlibtech_669_footnoteand the 	amendments had not been withdrawn.  The 	President ruled that 	Mahatmaji might take the 	permission of 	the house 	to substitute 	his resolution. 	All other 	amendments would be 	considered as 	amendments to 	the substituted resolution.  Thereupon 	Mahatma Gandhi in moving 	the withdrawal of his 	original resolution 	made an 	important statement 	giving an 	idea as 	to what had happened 	behind the 	scenes. He said: Before 	I move the resolution which has been circulated to you, I  	beg leave of the house to withdraw the resolution which I had the 	honour of moving the other day and to which so many amendments have 	al-ready been moved. I know that in asking for permission to 	withdraw my resolution I owe to the house an apology. You have been      
 put to consi-derable inconvenience and trouble and a great deal of time has been given to the consideration of the amendments. I was going to say that a great deal of time was wasted but it would not be proper to call it a waste of time, because the consideration of these propositions has enabled you to understand more fully than ever before the mental condition of many of the national workers. It is perfectly correct to insist upon leave being granted for the withdrawal of the resolution into which I had put so much force and to which I attach a great deal of importance, but the national life is a perpetual struggle whilst it is growing. It is a struggle not only against the environments that seek to crush us but also a struggle between our own ranks. Often the struggle between our own ranks is more prolonged, more exacting and even more bitter than the struggle against the environment which is outside ourselves. You may depend upon it that we who were behind the resolution which will be withdrawn and those who were behind the principal amendment of Pandit Jawaharlal put their heads together and wanted to avoid a conflict. Mr. Sambamurthi was sur-prised why Pandit Jawaharlal  Nehru was not here today. He may very well be surprised and I propose to take you into confidence. He was, as he said at the outset, not in sympathy with much that was going on in our midst. He has become impatient to throw off the yoke. Every twenty-four hours of his life he simply broods upon the grievances of his countrymen. He is impatient to remove the grinding pauperism of the masses. He is impatient against capitalists who are in the country exploi-ting the masses as he is against the capitalists who rule over this country and exploit and bleed this country in the words of late Lord Salisbury. I may tell you frankly that he is not in sympathy even with this resolution which I seek to substitute for the resolution which will be withdrawn if you give permission. He thinks this resolution itself falls far short of what he wants but, a high-souled man as he is, he does not want to create unnecessary bitterness. Bitterness and worse he is prepared to face if face them he must. He sees deliverance out of it by seeking to impose silence upon himself and remaining absent. Hence you find that even though he is a Secretary, and a faithful and diligent Secretary of the Congress, he feels that it is better  for  him  this morning to absent himself than be a helpless witness to proceedings with which he is not in sympathy. I am sorry because I do not share his discontent over this resolution, while I share all his grief, the intensity of grief over the pauperism of our country and the slavery which is grinding us down. I do not share his belief that what we are doing at the present moment is not sufficient for the present needs of the country. But how can he help feeling dissatisfied? He would not
 be Jawaharlal if he did not strike out for himself an absolutely unique and original line in pursuance of his path. He considers nobody, not even his father, nor wife, nor child. His own country and his duty to his own country he considers and nothing else.
 Now you understand why he is absent and now perhaps you will also understand why I have to perform the painful duty of with drawing the resolution which I moved, not because I am sorry for that resolution, not because I am not in love with that resolution, not because the one I am now going to move is a better resolution by any means; I hold that that was far superior to the resolution which is now in my hand. But as I have said, our life is a perpetual struggle against oppressive environments and a perpetual struggle within our ranks. If we want unity, then adjustment and readjustment, a series of compro- mises honourable to both parties and to variety of opinions, is to be effected. We invest every occasion with the importance of a sacred siddhanta or principle from which not an iota should be removed. Many of the things which we call by the name of principles are no more principles than so many details which we do not call principles, and therefore this resolution is a result of attempts on the part of all parties in this house or those parties who are interested in that resolution and its principle amendments. It is a resolution of compro- mise between them, of a series of adjustment and readjustment  between them. Hence, I feel that I am doing nothing wrong, not only that I am doing nothing wrong in asking for permission to withdraw that resolution although I consider it far superior to the resolution which I will presently move before you, but because I know that our national interest will be better served by the resolution which I  consider far inferior to the former resolution because it will hold all parties together. They are no more inclined to divide the house than I was or Pandit Motilal was. Both of us were for dividing the house because we thought that we would win, but what would that victory mean if it increased the bitterness, if it increased the weakening of our national unity and our national forces?
 There were not three or four people behind my original resolution but two parties behind it and even the principal amendment of Pandit Jawaharlal was a compromise. Even that fell far short of what he held to be dear to him, but he said, “If I could keep together all the different elements in the county I would waive my objection and move this resolution.” Hence you see that even that resolution was a result of compromise just as this is. Therefore if you still think that you will shoulder the responsibility and you consider that the interest of the country will be better served by not allowing me to withdraw that resolution, of course you can shoulder that responsi-
 bility, but remember what it means. I now leave the proposition in your hands.libtech_670_footnotelibtech_671_footnote(Applause)
 There are in our midst today those who would stop at nothing, who in their impatience do not mind if they rush headlong even to perdition. What are we to do? What am I to do—a man approaching his end? What am I to say to those flowers of the country who prize its liberty just as much as I do, if not perhaps much more? What am I to say to it? Am I to say I shall no longer come with you because I consider that my principle is better, my method is better, therefore you shall work out your own destiny; you shall work out that without my services? I assure you, it is not without a considerable pain, that I have taken up this position. I could have defied them just as they could have defied me, but they say: ‘We do not do it, because we want your services also, if we get them; but not altogether at your price. We want you to pay the same price to us also. We want you to meet us also.’ I could not possibly resist it without stultifying myself and without degrading myself. Although I feel it was a better resolution, I will move this with all the force at my command and with all the insistence that I put into the original resolution. This resolution, there- fore considering the circumstances, becomes really, for the time being, superior to the resolution that I moved and hence I ask for your leave to withdraw that resolution and let me put before you this resolution for your consideration.
 If after what I have told you, if after I have taken you into the secrets and if after I have told you of something which induced me to withdraw my resolution, if after all that you do not want that my original resolution be withdrawn and if you care to take that serious responsibility upon your shoulders, you can say that the resolution shall not be withdrawn. Then your vote will be tantamount to your voting for that resolution. But I warn you against that serious responsibility.libtech_672_footnote
 The President asked the house to signify its desire whether leave be allowed to Mahatmaji to withdraw his former resolutions and move the present agreed one. This was given by the whole house with show of hands. There were only four dissentients.
 Mahatmaji then moved his resolution:
 This Congress, having considered the onstitution recommended by the All-Parties Committee Report, welcomes it as a great contribution towards the solution of India’s political and communal problems, and congratulates the Committee on the
 
 virtual unanimity of its recommendations, and, whilst adhering to the resolution relating to Complete Independence passed at the Madras Congress, approves of the constitution drawn up by the Committee as a great step in political advance, especially as it re-presents the largest measure of agreement attained among the important parties in the country.
 Subject to the exigencies of the political situation this Congress will adopt the Constitution, if it is accepted in  its entirety by the British Parliament on or before December 31,1929, but in the event of its non-acceptance by that date or its earlier rejection, the Congress will organize a campaign of non-violent non-co-operation by advising the country to refuse taxation and in such other manner as may be decided upon.
 Consistently with the above, nothing in this resolution shall interfere with the carrying on, in the name of the Congress, of the propaganda for Complete Independence.
 In moving the  substituted resolution Mahatma Gandhi said:
 Friends, I don’t want to inflict a long speech upon you but I must confess to you that I have not been able to collect my thoughts, my brain is muddled and I have got to put my thoughts  together  as I proceed. It is really a fact that my brain is muddled. A physician will tell you what happens to a man who has to undergo an all-night vigil and that anxiously following the delicate proceedings as I had to do in a little tent nearby when the Convention Committee was meeting to which I was dragged, not called, by our Chairman. I had hoped that  I would not have to attend that Committee, but  a  peremptory summons came and I had to jump into a car that brought me to the place which I could not leave before half past two in the morning after which it was no longer possible for me to go and sleep.
 You will now see what I mean when I say I have got a muddled brain.
 The resolution that I have the honour of moving, you have already heard. I want you first of all to consider what  has  been omitted from the original resolution. It is necessary to do so not in order to commend this resolution to your attention because I know that this resolution having been accepted by the two parties, large parties in this house, it does not need any commendation. Even if I merely place this resolution before you I feel it is absolutely safe in your hands. There may be a few who may vote against it but it is not my purpose merely to get this resolution passed. That is the least important part of it. But my purpose is to draw your attention upon what is expected of you, why you are having this resolution and not
 the original resolution passed and what is expected of the party which is instrumental in having the first resolution watered down. You will find there is a glaring omission for which I am sorry. That is the omission in connection with the sending of the resolution to the Viceroy. I could understand even whilst I was drawing that clause that when it would be read to you some of you would be shocked and say to yourselves: ‘Thou too, non-co-operator!’ I rehearsed that to myself. But a non-co-operator, the author of non-co-operation, has brought in that clause and if I could even now convince you how important that clause is and if you ask me to restore it I would gladly restore it. I have no time. You do not know how pressed some of us are for time. I had no time even to discuss the reason for putting down that clause to the original proposition. I said to myself when I drew up that clause if I discovered any reluctance on your part I would gladly destroy it. But I want to put my case before this house not because of my reputation as non-co-operator—because that is well able to take care of itself, because there is still action left behind it—but because I want the house to understand the implications of non-co-operation as also the implications of this very resolution.
 Somebody has said that this resolution is a challenge and so it is. It is open to the British Government to interpret this as an insolent challenge if they wish. We need not be afraid of it. But if there is the slightest trace of change of heart about these in the governors then it is open to them also to understand the yearnings of the nation which is trying to rise, which is trying to throw off the yoke of thraldom. It would be better for them; it will be better also for the world because they represent a big nation. But we cannot help if they will not put correct interpretation upon this resolution. But as I said if it is a challenge it is also a threat. I am not frightened of going even to the House of Commons. I am not even frightened of going to the Viceroy. But when could I go there? Only when it is honourable for me to do so quite consistently with the creed of non-co-operation. I non-co-operate with the evil, I do not non-co-operate with the good. I do not non-co-operate with persons, I non-co-operate with measures and when measures commend themselves to me I co-operate with them. If the Viceroy today asks me to go to him to discuss things of importance for the country on a footing of equality I will go there barefooted and still defend my non-co-operation. If the time comes— and time must come, it is possible for you to hasten that time—it will be possible for you to hasten that day you have put before you, if you only work out that programme and approach the resolution in the spirit in which it ought to be approached. It is possible for you to have summons to go to the House of Commons and then you will go as
 non-co-operators, not as co-operators. Then you will go as national delegates who are required to come to some reasonable terms in  respect of what we are demanding. It won’t be something degrading to us, it won’t be something which is a right of the House of Commons to give and for you to take as beggars. It will be then a matter of “high contracting parties”, as the term goes and as it is described, even as South Africa went.
 I have been quoting to you things about South Africa, because not being a student of history which is written in dead pages but being a student of history which is now being written, I know more of South Africa than of any other country because I lived there. I tell you that General Botha and General Smuts fought so gallantly and bravely extorted the admiration of King Edward who sent a message saying: “I do not want to fight any longer with these gallant people.” It was then that these gallant generals went to England. But as what? They went as delegates and ambassadors of that nation to vindicate their honour, to gain their liberty not on terms dictated by the House of Commons but on terms they had settled at a Convention just like this. Have we got the bravery of those generals?libtech_673_footnote
 Have we got a General Botha in our midst who is prepared to sacrifice 20,000 acres of his valuable property and so many thousands of his sheep? You do not know perhaps that General Botha was one of the experts of the world in knowing a good sheep from a bad sheep. He was as free with these things as he was free with his life-blood. Have we got a General Botha? Have we got a General Smuts who is just as ready to tuck up his sleeves and work underground as to shoulder his rifle when the country demanded? I feel we have. If we had not I would not place this resolution before you. I would simply retire to Sabarmati.
 Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya asked me: ‘What is it that has brought you again out of your den? Is it again to coquet with the Swaraj Party because you were in love with Pandit Motilal Nehru? Is it still your lingering love for Motilal that has brought you?’ These are not his exact words. This is the substance of what Dr. Pattabhi said. You will, therefore, take this with some degree of reservation. I told him I would give an explanation of it. It was no lingering love but the burning love for my dear comrade. When he said:‘You were instrumental in putting this crown of thorns upon my head, you will now have to come and see how many bruises that crown of thorns caused to my head and you will have to come and share some of those bruises,’ I would be guilty of breach of friendship, I would be guilty of breach of duty to
 
 
 the nation, if after having pressed them to take their share at this critical juncture in the history of the country, I had not responded to his call and said: ‘I shall come on the day you fix and I shall leave on the day you ask me.’ (Applause) You now understand why I have come here and you now understand the importance I attach to this resolution, compromised though it is, weaker though it is, than the original resolution.
 Then coming to this clause about the Viceroy; that is because it was a necessary sequel to that resolution as it is a necessary sequel to this resolution. This resolution is really without its crown, but we are today suffering from what is known in psychology as inferiority complex. We have King Charles’ head dangling before our eyes every five minutes. You know the celebrated Mr. Dick who could  not possibly think of anything without imagining the head of King Charles. This brand of inferiority is marked on our foreheads, on our breasts. It is always dangling before us and worrying us to death. That we see in every-thing and there is the apprehension lest we might weaken ourselves. Now we are strengthening ourselves. It was, as some papers put it, an ultimatum. But it was a performance of courtesy. I expected those who are the trustees of the honour of the British nation to understand the implications of this resolution, I want them to understand the yearnings of the nation, and therefore I perform this delicate task, the delicate courtesy, of transmitting this resolution to them to do what they like with it. I understand what all these proceedings mean.
 I do not want to leave anything open to them to say ‘we do not know anything about this resolution’.
 Do not make any mistake about it, that this All-Parties Constitution is not a demand to be considered by the British nation, but do not go away with the idea that this is a document which is never to be considered by them. It is not a thing to be submitted to the Simon Commission, but this is a document to be considered by the British Government, by the Imperial Government, by the Viceroy and those who are today supposed to be ruling the destinies of India. It has been drafted for this purpose. I say it is also a Charter of Indepen- dence as we consider it today. Friends, I think I warned you against drawing any distinction between Dominion Status and Inde-pendence. I call it Independence. I had to say last night “for heaven’s sake, do not depart from this document” nor can you contemplate a departure from this document. It is a sacred document. It is nothing more, nothing less. If it is a sacred document, you cannot possibly depart from it. Then you will have a special session of the Convention and the Congress to consider the desirability of removing even a comma if
 necessary. Having given that sacred character to that docu-ment it does not mean that it has got to be kept in a treasure chest. It is a document which must be circulated and above all to Viceregal ranks. Do not leave it open to them to say: ‘You have not sent this for our consideration. Even if it was an ultimatum you should have sent it to us.’libtech_674_footnote
 I did the same thing in regard to Bardoli. I wrote a letter addressed to the Viceroy but within 24 hours  of  that  letter  I  had the painful duty of withdrawing it and reshaping it as I considered this was necessary because of the further eventslibtech_675_footnotelibtech_676_footnote. If I was suffering from the fever of inferiority complex I could have given an interview to the Press representatives and expected the Viceroy to send me an answer. But I took the proper course. Similarly, I want to take a proper course in regard to this resolution for thereby you will not weaken but strengthen your case if you are going to do anything at all.
 I again repeat that the Nehru Report has got to be considered by the British Parliament and by the Viceroy if it is to result in anything whatsoever. The authors of the Nehru Report knew it. You know it and I know it. It would be a sign of weakness, it would be undignified, not to recognize it. If the Viceroy is a worthy representative of his King and his nation, he will take note of this resolution even though it does not contain the clause which I should have liked to be inserted but from this platform I declare if he cares to read my remarks which  I do convey to him that it will be proper for him to take this resolution to heart and to understand that at least some of us mean to vindicate every word of what is contained in it. (“Hear, hear”) If you cry “hear, hear” then I ask you to restore that clause for submission to the Viceroy. (Cries of “No, no”) If you say “no” then I say you are suffering from inferiority complex. I have had some experience of it myself in South Africa where I was addressed as a cooly.libtech_677_footnote
 I now address my remarks to the impatient young men who have insisted upon 1929 and also to those who want December, 1930. When I put down 1930, I counted the consequences. So many friends have been coming to me and asking me:“If we vote for this resolution and if we vote for this programme, will you repeat what you did in 1920libtech_678_footnote, will you take virtual control of national affairs?” I said I have
 
 
 not got the strength today to fight single-handed. But I will if you come to terms with me and if you will bear the yoke. The yoke will be much tighter and much heavier than it was in 1920. It is a seasoned yoke and it has not worn out by usage. It becomes stronger and stronger by usage. If you give me the discipline that I shall exact, then certainly I will give you my work, so much of it as my frail body can give. Today I have come to perform a sacred duty to my country and after that my back is turned upon Calcutta and I retire to Sabarmati. I say to you that beyond putting this resolution before you, you may not expect anything unless these inexorable terms are granted to me by you, not unwillingly but of your own accord. It will be no use dragging me, no good asking me to take control unless you mean every word of what you say.
 I thought two years was a shortening of time to organize our forces, in order to give battle if we must give battle to the Government. One year is nothing, one year will be required to create the discipline in our ranks. Our Congress roll today is nothing but a bogus affair. Let us face facts. It is worth nothing. If I went with inspectors to examine the Congress registers it would be a sad disappointment for me. We want a living register of the Congress. We want to be in a position to say even from day to day, so many more members are enrolled, so much more yarn given, so many more four-anna bits given and whatever it is, but I would expect the figure to come to our Central Office from week to week if not from day to day, showing enhanced subscription and increasing membership.
 That will take one year and one year more will be required for giving ourselves confidence and courage, and for consolidation of communal unity. Communal unity is not yet in sight. Much has got to be done. The whole of last night was spent in trying to bring about communal unity. We want some time for the atmosphere to clear. I hold therefore that two years is all too short a time. But I said to myself: ‘What does it matter if all these impatient young men want me to share the discredit of showing nothing at the end of one year? I will share it.’ I have given the warning that if they do not give a good account of themselves in terms of this resolution and no other, they will earn discredit and I shall gladly share it with them as a comrade and a party to this document. But I give them a warning from this public platform. Let them give themselves night in, night out and day in and day out to work out the constructive part of the programme in terms of the resolution in order to hasten the march towards our goal.
 I now come to the Madras Congress approval. It would have needed no commentary on my part but for a discussion we had in the tent. I simply want to clarify the issues. Independence we may
 reiterate from a million platforms in the name of the Congress, but we must not treat the report of the All-Parties Committee as something separate from Independence. By approving it, you are not weakening your struggle for Independence. You are using that document as a stage and as a big stage in your progress towards Independence and as you harangue upon Independence from your platforms, it will be your duty, if you are true to this resolution of approval to your constitution, to say, ‘We want you to treat this Nehru Report in terms of our goal and consolidate the Nehru Report in the struggle for Independence.’ Do not consider the Nehru Report as an excrescence to be deplored but regard it as an integral part of the struggle. I tell you that this resolution commits you to that attitude of mind. Unless you do that, the Nehru Report really will be a halter round your necks, and it will be always like King Charles’ head coming before you and you will always seek to hide it behind you. And if somebody says, ‘what about the Nehru Report?’ you will omit all mention of it or pretend you did not hear him or had forgotten all about it. If that is your attitude towards the Nehru Report, then do not approve  it  because approval means that you like it, you appreciate their labour, you feel that they have discharged the national trust and they have discharged the trust on behalf of those who want independence and nothing else. They have worked on behalf of them as much as they have worked on behalf of those who are still frightened of Indepen- dence, who cannot stand the glare of Independence and they have worked for both parties, they have accommodated both parties, but the Independent-wallah has nothing to be ashamed of in this Report but everything to be proud of. You can make what you like out of that Report and I think you can make much more out of that Report than the man who cannot stand the dazzle and glare of Independence.
 You call it special pleading. I have never been guilty of that art. Every word that I say comes out of the deepest recesses of my heart. The heart is responding although the brain is reeling. I ask you to bear in mind what you are doing when you accept the resolution. Do not say that it is a waste paper or a consolation prize to Motilal Nehru lest he be offended with the magnificent ride he had on a chariot drawn by 34 more or less white horses. After that triumphant ride he stands in no need of a consolation prize. Much less do I need a consolation prize.
 I want drops of your life-blood  to  mingle  with  mine,  the  drops of Hindu blood to mingle with Muslim blood and Sikh blood, Parsi blood and Christian  blood  so  that  a  magnificent  memorial may rise in Calcutta, if you like, to show what this nation has done in order to earn its liberty, in order to buy its liberty, not with gold but with blood. That is what I want you to read into this resolution. The
 resolution calls you to that duty and nothing else. Then there is very little left for me to say.
 But I had better explain to you the exigencies of the political situation. Of course it sticks in the throat. It is again an interpolation from that old dame “Inferiority Complex”,but sometimes we will have to treat old dames as young maidens. Supposing that a Viceroy or a Secretary of State for India loses his head and says: “What are these insolent men doing, firing these insults against the nation and demanding Dominion Status even at the point of the bayonet?” We have no bayonets. But the points of our pens sometimes feel like bayonets. But how can we avoid it? If yearnings of our hearts, if the miseries or signs of the burning of our hearts, are misread, we cannot help it. But they choose to do so, imprison some of us, or do some- thing worse. Suppose after this resolution and after all we are doing here, we have a demonstration against the Simon  Commission whenever it comes officially to Calcutta—the last time I understand it did not come officially and therefore you restrained yourselves and showed how you were capable of behaving yourselves—but when it makes its official entry and you welcome it with  black  flags, supposing then that some Superintendent of Police in the discharge of his duty as he considers it, uses his rifle, what are we to do? Are we still to say “Yes, we shall accept Dominion Status”? We can say that if we do not want to treat it as an exigency of the political situation and if we do not feel strong enough, we can swallow that injury, and weak we certainly are, and yet we can say:“Yes, we shall accept Dominion Status.” But we may get together sufficient courage and have a mani- festation of such courage within us that will enable us to say “No more Dominion Status, no more parleying. Now Complete Indepen- dence”. That is a political exigency that we have provided for.
 If the Commission reads these signs aright, it will see the country stands by the Nehru Report. Of course there is no such hope from the Commission to read the signs aright. And I am not such a simpleton to believe it but I am also an irrepressible optimist. If some sudden influx of energy comes to us, the Hindus, and if Mohammedans and Sikhs say after having listened to this mad man and known the fire that was burning in his breast: “Let us shed our mutual distrust and say we don’t want communalism at all”, we shall trust our Muslim and Sikh friends and if as a result of the trust some of us have to die or to be deprived of our franchise and rights, it does not matter, that will be a step in our march towards our goal; if that kind of courage and conviction comes to you all of a sudden, then I promise that Sir John Simon will say: “That is my Report, I understand the situation in Indiaas no other representative of the British Nation does
 understand.” Today we have not got that atmosphere, we have not got that trust, we have not got that self-confidence, hence you hedge yourselves round with all the badges of inferiority complex. But the key lies in the resolution which I have placed before you.

WHAT IS IN A NAME?","
 December 29, 1928
 At the time of writing this (forenoon, 29th December) it is too early to give my impressions of the Congress. The events are moving and changing so fast that the impressions of the morning are nullified by those of the evening. Meanwhile, therefore, it may be well to understand the controversy raging round  Dominion Status and Independence. The more I hear the arguments of those who have forced the issue, the more clearly do I see the harm that is being done by it. Up to a certain point it was perhaps health giving and necessary. It was certainly good to appreciate the fact that nothing short of independence could possibly be the goal of the nation and that therefore every advance should be interpreted in terms of independence. It follows therefore that every political change  or reform that may impede the nation’s march towards independence should be rejected.
 But what is the meaning of this independence? For me its meaning is swaraj. Independence is a word employed for European consumption. And those whose eyes are turned outward, whether it be towards West or East, North or South are thinking of anything but India’s independence. For finding India’s independence  we  must look to India and her sons and daughters, her needs, and capacity. It is obvious that the contents of her independence must therefore vary with her varying needs and increasing capacity. India’s independence therefore need not have the meaning current in the West. Italian independence is different from that of England,  Sweden’s  differs from both.
 One thing that we need is undoubtedly freedom from British control in any shape or form. But freedom from such control of any other power is equally our need in terms of independence. The Nehru Report points the way to such freedom and it prescribes the remedy that India can assimilate today. It is a worthless document if it means anything less. Its acceptance is wholly compatible with the national goal and I venture to think that the fiercest champion of national
 independence can and should safely work for its full fruition. The Report is not an end in itself. It simply gives us the formula according to which we should work. It presumes concentrated ceaseless work by all the different parties before it can bear fruit.
 Great confusion has been created by tearing the much abused expression ‘Dominion Status’ from its context. It is not an elixir of life to be imported from Westminster to put life into us. The expression has been used by the distinguished authors of the Report to show by analogy what in their opinion is needed for  India’s political growth. The scheme of government adumbrated in the Report, whether it is known by the expression Dominion Status or any other, whilst it may fully answer our needs today, may easily fall short of them tomorrow. But it contains its own corrective. For it is  a  scheme to be worked out by the nation, not one to be imposed upon or thrown at her by Britain. If it fructifies, it contains all we need for future growth; hence I call it the Charter of our Independence.
 After all, if the Nehru Report is consigned to oblivion, we shall still need a charter. It may be known as the charter of India’s independence and may still conceivably be much less than the Dominion Status of the Nehru Report.
 If what we want therefore cannot be sufficiently described by the swadeshi word swaraj, it cannot be described by any other word that can be coined. All that the man in the street should know is that he wants the scheme of government framed by the nation’s represen- tatives without the change of a comma and then he can say with the greatest confidence: ‘What is in a name?’
 That the Nehru scheme requires endorsement by the British Parliament is no defect in it. Since we are connected with Britain, we shall in every case need some sort of endorsement from her Parliament whether the scheme is to be transmutation of the present bondage into an absolutely equal partnership to be destroyed at will or whether it is to end every sort of connection with Britain. I shall always maintain that the transmutation, complete conversion, is any day a higher status than destruction. But of this later. Enough for us to learn by heart for the moment that any scheme to take us towards swaraj or if you will, independence, must be framed by us and must be accepted without a single alteration dictated by the British Parliament.

 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 I have a few moments to myself today and I give them to this letter. Despite pressure of work and late hours, I have kept good health.
 Tell Gangabehn that she should take complete rest and not be in a hurry to resume work. Tell Shankerbhailibtech_679_footnotelibtech_680_footnotethat he should never spend as much as one hour in the lavatory. In any case he should never strain. He should make changes in his diet and improve his health, or go out to some other place and do so. It will be quite proper for Kamalalibtech_681_footnotelibtech_682_footnoteto make the kind of chapatis her father requires, but it is not proper to cook his meals separately. We have to learn to run a joint kitchen and overcome all the difficulties which arise. We have taken a vow to continue this experiment for at least a year. I believe, therefore, that we can make no changes.
 I expect to leave this place on the 2nd or the 3rd. I hope to reach there before the 11th in any case. Mirabehn is coming here tomorrow and from here she will go to Bihar.
About other things, in the next letter or when we meet.

590,"December 29, 1928","SPEECH ON RESOLUTION ON CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMME, CALCUTTA
	CONGRESSlibtech_683_footnote","
  
 December 29, 1928
 The President [Pandit Motilal Nehru] then requested Mahatmaji to move his second resolution which runs as follows:libtech_684_footnote
 Mahatmaji said that he had no desire of detaining the house for many minutes
 
 in explaining the resolution. It was plain enough. After what he had listened to for the last half an hour he would only say that the resolution could be worked out only by true Congressmen. It was only by them that the revival and organization of non-co-operation was possible. If they wanted the Nehru Report to fructify, the least that they could do was to work out the resolution with the greatest concentration and with equal integrity during the coming months.libtech_685_footnote
 Mahatma Gandhi said that he thought that he could take over one or two things from the amendments but when he ran his eye over the amendments suggested, he found nothing which needed to be taken over in the original resolution. The National Volunteers Corps was already in the country. He had proposed an effective use of the National Volunteers. As regards the suggestion about the peasantry and workers, he had been engaged in organizing the peasantry and workers and he did not think there was any person in that assembly there who could claim greater knowledge of the organization of the peasantry than himself. Knowing the matter as well as he did he was not inclined to take over this clause also because the clause in its most effective part was already in the resolution. There was one thing which he would like to clear up and that was with reference to the five per cent. He had never anticipated that the five per cent contribution was to last for ever. What he had anticipated was that this programme would be adhered to for one year and it would prove to be an effective test   as to what the nation was capable of doing. If the nation could honestly work out, then the fear that Mrs. Besant had as to non-violent non-co-operation, non-payment of taxes and civil disobedience would be totally dispelled. The probability was that there would be no occasion for any such drastic step or direct action. She will discover that there is no such atmosphere in the country and that there is no untowardness from non-payment of taxes or other forms of civil disobedience. She had no fear of civil disobedience or suspension of taxes in Bardoli, and she thought that the people of Bardoli were justified because she said that the people had a felt grievance and there they could act as one man. But here they did not have a felt grievance or a longing or yearning for swaraj. If they had, they would not find the gross irregularities which had been brought to notice. He was very glad that these irregularities had been reported and hoped the matter would be properly investigated and the complaint effectively dealt with. With regard to the percentage he said it was intended as an acid test of the sincerity of the Congressmen. If they were really sincere about this programme and about getting the Nehru scheme accepted by the British Parliament or on failure of acceptance they were going to work out independence for themselves, and independence could not be gained simply by shouting from the house-tops, then they would not hesitate over this five per cent. He had deliberately excluded anything below Rs. 100, because he knew what difficulties some families had and he had also provided for excluding even this five per cent for the same reason, and left these
 
 matters to be dealt with by the Working Committee. If Congressmen were prepared to honestly work this programme, this test would show it. But if a proper atmosphere was not created then this would not be forthcoming except from solitary promises. He knew there was the danger of Congressmen leaving in force, of honest Congressmen who would fear that the money would be wasted and not properly applied. He considered all these dangers but unless they incorporated this provision for the purpose of making the Congress effective they would not make much headway. In spite of all these dangers he would take courage in both his hands and say no, as they all knew that he was an irrepressible optimist. He pressed the Resolution for their acceptance. If they liked they might remove that clause.
 All the amendments were put to vote and lost and  Mahatma  Gandhi’s resolution put en bloc and carried.

 I have your letter. I see that I shall not be able to start from here before the 3rd.
 After I return there, you must give yourself some rest from office work.
 The problem here has become very complicated this time. I simply cannot say what the outcome will be.
 It is a question how long the Mandir should go on supervising khadi work done outside. Lakshmidas’s view certainly deserves con- sideration. We bear Prabhudas’s expenses as incidental to his living where he does. About Shantilallibtech_691_footnote, I have been thinking. I had a talk with Chhaganlal.
 I for one feel that if the parents of any inmates of the Mandir come there and cannot take their meals in the joint kitchen, we cannot make separate arrangements for them. Our decision on this point will depend on our intention as to the direction in which we wish to  develop the Mandir. If we wish to develop it into an Ashram, we ought to weaken our personal ties. If we wish to develop in the opposite direction and take interest in worldly life, the number of separate kitchens is bound to increase. If I want shirolibtech_692_footnotelibtech_693_footnotefor myself, I must get it cooked in the Mandir’s kitchen. If my relations come,  the  only kitchen I have is the Mandir’s kitchen. Our uncles should know that our family has grown in the Mandir. I for one feel that we cannot add to the two exceptionslibtech_694_footnotelibtech_695_footnotewhich we have made.

602,"December 31, 1928","602 SPEECH ON RESOLUTION ON NEHRU REPORT, CALCUTTA
CONGRESS—IIIlibtech_698_footnote","
 December 31, 1928
 At Monday’s sitting of the Congress, Mahatma Gandhi moved the following compromise resolutionlibtech_699_footnote.
 Mahatma Gandhi in moving the resolution delivered a short speech in Hindi. As the loudspeakers failed to work, his speech could not be heard  and  Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru repeated his speech sentence by sentence.
 Mahatmaji in the course of his speech said that after due consideration and carefully judging the whole situation he was going to move the resolution before the house. The younger group in the house were eager for Complete Independence.libtech_700_footnote
 If you all wish India to become free you should stop all this controversy about Dominion Status and Independence. You should remember swaraj is what we have outlined here [in this Report]. I have come all the way from Sabarmati Ashram to support the Nehru Committee’s recommendation. And that also because the Report is the tangible fruit of the directive given by the Madras Congress. Today we may accept this as swaraj in a way. I don’t know what shape it will take tomorrow. We must always insist on truth. If people give up truth and self-respect or break promises and disregard tradition,  they  cannot secure freedom for they don’t deserve it.
 You must honour the compromise I have worked out in the Subjects Committee. If you think I am lowering the ideal of Congress, you may repudiate me and not listen to me. I do not want you to accept the resolution simply because I have moved it. You must accept it only if you are prepared to work the specified programme. If you reject this then you will have to find yourself another President, as your present President is the moving spirit behind this resolution. I do not believe in resorting to dirty manoeuvring to obtain a majority vote. It will only delay swaraj. If you want swaraj you must cleanse your mind of all such ideas by voting for this Resolution.libtech_701_footnote
 Replying to the debate, Mahatma Gandhi said that his  remarks  were principally addressed to young Bengal and if they considered for one moment that a mere Gujarati could not understand young Bengal, then young Bengal would commit a most serious blunder.libtech_702_footnote
 
 I will ask you not to interrupt me when I am endeavouring to address a few words to you, as a fellow-worker of yours. If however you want to interrupt me, I shall certainly retire and not address you. If on the other hand you want to listen to me, then listen to me in perfect silence. I want to make it absolutely clear that if you are wise, you will dismiss from your mind the bogey of Independence v. Dominion Status. There is no opposition between Dominion Status and Independence. I do not want a Dominion Status that will interfere with my fullest growth, with my independence. These words, I suggest, are misleading. I would therefore suggest a better method. That is in- dependence whereby we can grow to our fullest height. We are the architects of our own destiny and I suggest that the architects of the Nehru Report are your own countrymen appointed by you. There is no hand on the part of the Government in the framing of this docu- ment. This document owes its origin to the Madras Congress and it is through the Madras Congress that this Committee was appointed and it is this Report by which I ask you to stand for the time being. The question has been agitating my mind since yesterday afternoon when I heard that there was going to be seriously put  forward  an amendment to this resolution on behalf of those who, I thought, were  a party to the resolution that I moved.
 The resolution that I have submitted to this house is the direct result of a compromise. The resolution that I originally framed, you have not seen. And even the one that was printed and moved in the Subjects Committee was also in a way the result of informal com- promise or some kind of understanding, whatever language you might wish to use. That resolution was not framed by me only; there were many heads behind that. There was an attempt to placate as many parties as it was possible to placate. That resolution was discussed by various men, men who were supposed to represent different parties. I do not want to suggest that you are bound by that resolution but I do want to say that those who were supposed to be behind that resolution were honour-bound to support it.
 If anybody runs away with the idea that I am here appealing to sentiment, he is in the wrong. You can appeal to one’s sense  of  honour and I am proud of having made my appeal to that sense of honour. I suggest that if those who were behind this compromise sub- sequently discovered that they have committed a blunder and that they must clear their position before the world and say that they are penitent for what they had done previously, I suggest that penitence is made of sterner stuff. It is not made by amendments. There are other drastic steps to be taken. If those who were behind the compromise consider that they have committed no such blunder but have
 committed only tactical blunder or a blunder that involves displeasure of some party, then I suggest that it is their bounden duty to swallow that blunder and abide by that compromise. If you have not got that sense of honour and if, giving a word of honour you are not sure that it should be kept at any cost, then I say that you will not be able to make this nation free.
 You may take the name of Independence on your lips just as the Muslims utter the name of Allah or a pious Hindu utters the name of Krishna or Rama, but all that muttering will be an utterly empty formula if there is no honour behind it. If you are not prepared to stand by your own words, where will Independence be? Independence is after all a thing made of sterner stuff. It is not made by wriggling of words. I suggest that if you want to vindicate the honour of this  nation, because the Viceroy insults us or president of a European Chamber of Commerce insults us, we say, we want our independence because we want to vindicate our honour, then you are dragging independence into the mire. Do not imagine for a moment that I am trying to snatch a vote from you. Believe me there is no such thing at the back of my mind.
 I would fain suffer defeat at the hands of young men, but I am jealous of their honour. If you, young men, who are behind this amendmentlibtech_703_footnote, understand the significance of the message I am deliver- ing to you, you may say for the present that you have committed a blunder but that you want to abide by that compromise because our leaders have entered into compromise. If you think it is not a matter of honour, if you think that the independence of the country will be lost if you accept my resolution, I invite you to throw out my resol- ution by an overwhelming majority. But if you accept my resolution by an overwhelming majority or even by any majority whatsoever, then those who vote for this resolution should understand that it would be a matter of honour for them to work for it because they pledge themselves for it.
 But why are you so oppressed? Why are you labouring under that inferiority complex that within a year we shall not be able to convince the British Parliament that we shall not be able to marshal our forces and summon to ourselves the strength that we need? Swaraj is my birthright just as breathing through the lungs is my birthright. It must be as natural to you as your breath. Why are you so afraid.?
 I have got full faith. If you will help me and follow the pro- gramme honestly and intelligently, I promise that swaraj will come
 
 within one year. I want you to die a proper death. I want you to develop full courage and die with calculated courage. If you have got that courage, if you can stand with your breast bare before the bullet, then I promise, you will get all that you possibly desire. Do not be frightened by the shadow. Do not be afraid of the long-drawn-out agony. I admit that it is a longdrawn-out process, but  under  the present state of the country when we cannot trust our brothers and sisters, our parents, and party leaders, when we cannot trust anybody, when we have no sense of honour, when we cannot allow our words to remain unaltered for 24 hours, do not talk of independence. But if you will develop that calm courage and honesty of purpose and that determination which will refuse to accept ‘no’ for an answer to your demand, then I promise what the tallest among us can possibly desire.
 Throughout these days we have heard a great deal that we are not able to carry on the Congress election campaign in an honest manner. It cut me to the quick when I heard that delegates’ tickets passed hands and were sold like bills of exchange and the rates increased as the days went on and rupee ticket sold for Rs. 15. It is discreditable to the Congress and I tell you that you are not going to get Independence by these methods. On the other hand you are  forging your own shackles, from which there will be no  escape because it is of your own will.
May God direct you in coming to a decision.
 I do not want you to decide the question, because I am the mover of the resolution or because Pandit Motilal is at the back of the resolution. It is you who must decide with your calm reasoning but showing honour with it.libtech_704_footnote(Loud applause)

RESISTANCE STRUGGLE — THE FINAL STAGESlibtech_708_footnote","
       	[Before 1929] He who played an important part in the Indian 	Passive Resistance Movement did not live to see the final stages. He 	has described the struggle 	in his own graphic style in his monographlibtech_709_footnotelibtech_710_footnoteon 	me, Gandhi.  	This chapter is intended to take a brief survey of the movement from 	where Mr. Doke left it. No Englishman had such a keen grasp of the 	subject as he, by patient study, had acquired. Busy though he was 	with the work of his own flock, if a man of his breadth of vision 	and his all-round humanity could be said to have had a special 	flock, he made this Indian question as much his own as the work of 	the Pastorate. He collected and tabulated every scrap of paper upon 	the subject. He wrote much upon it. He saw the authorities and spoke 	to them with the certainty of the knowledge of an expert. He took 	charge of the editorial work of the Passive Resistance organ, Indian 	Opinion, during Mr. Gandhi’s and Mr. Polak’s absence 	from South Africalibtech_711_footnotelibtech_712_footnote. The leading articles he wrote for the journal during 	the period are literary monuments. His anxiety to keep up the 	traditions of the       14-10-1908 	“Letter to Maganlal Gandhi” and “Letter to Shapurji 	Saklatvala”, 20-5- 1927  
 journal was so great that, in matters of policy, he took the advice of and allowed himself to be guided by, those whom he was not bound to consult. He came in contact with the best and the worst of Indians. All his study was not merely to bring to a close a movement, however great it may have been. He had dreams about the future of South Africa, the part that Indians were to play in it, the part that Christianity had to play in the great drama that was being enacted before him. His Indian work was taken up in answer to the question of his soul.“What am I to do in South Africa in the midst of many races?”
 Mr. Doke had intended, if he had lived, to take part in the constructive programme of the Indian community after the struggle was finished. He had intended, too, to write a volume on the lessons of the struggle. But that was not to be.
 The readers of these pages will, however, be glad to know the final results of the historical struggle which attracted world-wide atten- tion. Only a bird’s-eye view is possible in a single chapter of a book, when a full description would require several volumes. During the last stages it took a most unexpected and brilliant turn. Every act of repression by the authorities only heartened the resisters. The refusal of the Government to recognize the legal status of Indian miners and to abolish the poll-tax on indentured Indians, which it was claimed on their behalf the Government had promised the late Mr. Gokhale to do, brought thousands to the Passive Resistance fold. Indentured Indians, working in the Natal mines and in the sugar fields, struck work and sought imprisonment. This strike must be distin-guished from  ordinary strikes. It was undertaken, not to usurp the functions of the Government or to paralyse the industries concerned. It was declared simply as a protest against the £ 3 tax. It was an assertion on the part of the strikers, men and women, of their self-respect. They were no longer content to pay a tax, which not only told heavily upon their slender purses, but which was a mark of their degradation and a causeof terror to the womenfolk. At one time, nearly 30,000 men were on strike. The Government and the planters tried every means to bend the strikers, but without avail. They had but one purpose in life, these strikers refused to be left alone. They wanted to fill the prisons. After due notice to the Government, nearly 2,000 of them, men, women and children, marched into the Transvaal. They had no legal right to cross the border, their destination was Tolstoy Farm, established by Mr. Kallenbach for Passive Resisters, the distance to be covered was 150 miles. No army ever marched with so little burden. No waggons or mules accompanied the party. Each one carried his own blankets and daily rations, consisting of one pound of bread and one ounce of sugar. This meagre ration was sup-plemented by what Indian mer-
 
 chants gave them on their way. The Government imprisoned the leaders, i.e. those whom they thought were leaders. But they soon found that all were leaders. So when they were nearly within reach of their destination, the whole party was arrested. Thus their object (to get arrested) was accomplished.That extreme reasonableness  was mixed with such an unbending spirit that was shown when the Indian strikers voluntarily stayed their activity during the strike of the Government railwaymen, which was certainly not a Passive Resistance Movement.
 The Indian strikers at once stood aloof, and their self-restraint was much appreciated throughout the Empire, whilst it had not a little to do with the final settlement for which negotiations were opened.
 It will be easily imagined that India would not remain supine when a mighty effort was being made by her sons in this far-off continent. Under the  splendid  leadership  of the  late  Honourable Mr. Gokhale, meetings of protest were held all over the country, and thousands of pounds were collected to aid the Resisters. Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy, who strongly protested in a public speech at Madraslibtech_713_footnotelibtech_714_footnoteagainst what was transpiring in South Africa, sent a Commi- ssionlibtech_715_footnotelibtech_716_footnoteto investigate the cause of the upheaval. A local Commission was appointed. Though for high political reasons, the Indian comm- unity as a whole refused to give evidence before it, the Commissioners completely vindicated the Resisters by declaring in favour of every one of the main contentions of the aggrieved Indians. And so at last legislation was passed, repealing the poll-tax, restoring racial equality in law, and recognizing the status of Indian wives. Thus ended the great struggle in 1914, after having lasted nearly eight years.
 Mr. Doke, along with many, considered it to be a religious or ethical struggle. It was not undertaken in order to gain individual rights but to gain national dignity. The methods adopted were not
 those of brute force or violence, but those of self-sacrifice and suffe- ring. Repeal of obnoxious legislation was an embodiment of the vital principle that Indian sentiment must not be flouted on Indian matters. It was an admission of the right of the Indians to be consulted in everything affecting their status and intimate well-being. And it was for such an achievement that Mr. Doke laboured during his life time.z time. Who knows how important a part he would have played in the more difficult work of reconstruction? Certainly the Indian community misses the guiding hand.

607,"January 1, 1929","SPEECH ON CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMME, CALCUTTA CONGRESS","
  
 January 1, 1929
 Mahatmaji first spoke in Hindi explaining the  resolution.  Speaking  in English he said:
I do not want to detain you for long over the resolution which is
 an integral part of the first resolutionlibtech_717_footnotewhich you were good enough to endorse yesterday. It was only for the sake of convenience that the Subjects Committee insisted upon dividing this one resolution into two parts; one in connection with the Nehru Committee Report and the second in connection with the programme of work based upon that Report. Hence it is that the second part of the first resolution I am now putting before you today. But it was after all a happy thing for “all’s well that ends well”, and that arrangement enables me to give you the welcome information that a complete agreement without any mental reservation has been accomplished. I don’t propose to read that resolution to you, because you have had that resolution before you and I am trying to economize my voice, energy and time as much as possible. Therefore, let us consider it an arrangement between yours- elves and me that I do not read this resolution.
 There are two amendments to the resolution and of these amen- dments Mr. Satyamurthi has chosen the second one. But now as I have agreed to his suggestions, he has authorized me to withdraw his alternative amendment and the suggestions I have accepted are these. You will notice in his alternative resolution that he refers to the organization of the peasantry and workers. So far as the peasantry is concerned you will find in my resolution there is a reference where the volunteers are called upon to enlist themselves in order to do village reconstruction work, and this village reconstruction work is nothing but the organization of the peasantry and workers upon an economic basis. We want to enter into the hearts of the peasants. We want to identify ourselves completely with the masses. We want to make their woes our own. We want to feel with them in everything in order to better the lot of those on whose toil we the people of the city are really living. We must therefore make common cause with the workers. I do not want it for one moment to be understood that the
 
 city workers and labourers are to be neglected; I cannot  possibly mean that because I am myself organizing labour, and I have been identifying myself with labour for the last 30 or 35 years of my life. So I have no hesitation in accepting that part. The second suggestion that I have adopted is in connection with the tax; I suggested in my resolution five per cent, on incomes exceeding Rs. 100. Personally, I would like that clause, but many of my friends and many Con- gressmen have suggested that it would work as a hardship  upon people. People cannot really pay so much, they cannot really pay. If they cannot pay, there is a remedy in that clause itself. The suggestion was that they are not yet in the habit of conforming to that exact discipline whereby men or women would automatically recognize it as a compulsory obligation to pay. I have appreciated the force of that argument and therefore I have accepted the suggestion so that that clause will now be remodelled. I am not telling you how it is to be remodelled, because I have not really the text of that clause before me and you do not want me to worry you about it just now. But it will enable you to carry out the meaning of what I am telling you just now. That clause will be so worded as to carry out the formula that was suggested for another thing by Deshbandhu Das that the Congress expects every Congressman to contribute to the Congress  coffers month by month in accordance with his ability, in order to advance the cause of the Congress, more especially in order to embark upon a programme that is set forth in the foregoing resolution. That will be the wording instead of the wording in the last clause of the printed paper. I do not want to take up your time any longer but I cannot help giving you a warning note. I want you to take this resolution seriously and I want you to adhere with all seriousness to this resolution. I do not want you to raise your hands as accepting this resolution and then sleep over it for a solid twelve months and expect the A.I.C.C. or the Working Committee or the President to work wonders for you. Neither the President nor the A.I.C.C. have a magic wand. There is no magic wand except your own iron determination and will and that is the magic wand that will alone bring swaraj within your grasp and give the country peace and happiness. Therefore, I would beseech you not to accept the resolution with the two suggestions adopted unless everyone here in his own person means seriously to carry out all the items of the programme which are appli- cable to them and unless you are determined to take the message of the Congress from door to door ceaselessly for these twelve months.
 At the end of this period I hope to see an atmosphere totally different from the atmosphere of distrust and despondency that I can read in the faces of every one of us today.
 With these words I leave this resolution in your hands and I thank you for giving me this very patient hearing.libtech_718_footnote(Loud  and  con- tinued applause)
 The resolution ran as follows:
Meanwhile the Congress shall engage in the following activities:
  In 	the Legislatures 	and outside 	every attempt will be 	made to 	bring about total 	prohibition of 	intoxicating drugs and 	drinks; picketing of 	liquor and drug 	shops shall 	be organized wherever 	desirable and possible.  Inside 	and outside 	the legislatures, 	methods suited to res- 	pective environment 	shall be immediately 	adopted to 	bring about 	boycott of 	foreign cloth by 	advocating and 	stimulating production 	and adoption 	of hand-spun 	and hand-woven khaddar.  Specific 	grievances, wherever discovered and where people 	are ready, shall be 	sought to 	be redressed by 	non-violent action as 	was done 	recently at Bardoli.  Members 	of Legislatures 	returned on the 	Congress ticket 	shall devote the bulk of 	their time 	to the 	constructive work 	settled from time to 	time by 	the Congress Committee.  The 	Congress organization 	shall be perfected 	by enlisting 	members and 	enforcing stricter discipline.  Measures 	shall be taken to 	remove the 	disabilities  of women 	and they 	will be invited 	and encouraged 	to take their 	due share 	in national upbuilding. Measures 	shall be taken 	rid the country 	of social abuses.  It 	will be 	the duty of 	all Congressmen, being 	Hindus, to do 	all they 	can to 	remove untouchability 	and help 	the so-called 	untou- chables 	in every 	possible way in 	their attempt to 	remove their disabi- 	lities and 	better their condition.  Volunteers 	shall be 	enlisted to 	take up 	the work 	among the city 	labourers and 	village reconstruction 	in addition 	to what 	is being 	done through 	the spinning-wheel 	and khaddar.  Such 	other work as may 	be deemed 	advisable in order 	to advance 	nation-building in 	all its department 	and in 	order to 	enable the 	Congress to 	secure the 	co-operation in 	the national 	effort of 	the people 	engaged in different pursuits. 
 
 In order to finance the activities mentioned in the foregoing programme, the Congress expects every Congressman to contribute to the Congress coffers a certain percentage of his or her income accor- ding to his or her ability.

     Mahatmaji 	then moved:  January 	1, 1929 
  	This Convention is of opinion that the resolutions it has already 	passed on the recommendations of the All-Parties Committee contained 	in clauses one to six of their Report suffi- ciently indicate the 	will of the nation as to the nature and main principles of the 	constitution acceptable to it and is further of opinion that except 	on points on which notes of dissent have been recorded at the 	instance of some of the parties present there is a general agreement 	on the basis of the solution of com- munal problem recommended by 	the said Committee.  	This Convention adjourns sine die authorizing the  Working 	Committee of the Indian National Congress to convene it when 	necessary for more detailed examination of the recom- mendations of 	the Committee.  In 	doing so Mahatmaji offered an apology for his presence in the 	Convention but he came as a legal adviser to the President who had 	met him and Pandit Motilal and requested them to be present in the 	Convention and help him with advice.  To facilitate work he was 	going to move the present resolution and hoped there should not be 	much discussion and no amendment. Continuing, Mahatmaji said:  	Whilst we have very nearly exhausted the Nehru Report and accepted 	it without much alteration, yet much still remains to be done. The 	situation in the country is such that we shall have to keep both the 	Nehru Report and the Convention alive.  As 	regards the Mohammedan  question, 	 he  said  the  	Convention  had 	 not been 	able to placate 	all parties. 	The Sikhs also required 	to be placated. 	continuing, Mahatmaji said: Personally 	I think we have not done full justice to the Sikhs.    
 Hence it is necessary for all of you to put your heads together and make suggestions and evolve order out of chaos. There is the Utkal question which still requires to be solved and is giving trouble. This question is a nightmare. It crops up in all my speeches. The exhibition given by Utkal delegates the other day was like an animal undergoing vivisection.
 The Nehru Report can only be touched here and there and not in its entirety. Only in matters of detail can we make alterations. If anything is wanted to satisfy the Muslims then also we have to touch it but if the Muslims spring some surprise it is not for the Nehru Committee to do so. That is the business of some other organization.
 Mahatmaji concluded with the hope that the resolution be carried without any amendment.libtech_720_footnote
 Mahatmaji announced that as a result of discussion he had come to some compromise and agreed to make some verbal alterations in the latter part of the resolution.libtech_721_footnote

609,"January 	2, 1929",INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS libtech_722_footnote,"
        CALCUTTA, 
  January 	2, 1929  The 	Mahatma had just returned from his morning walk and was surrounded 	by a score of his followers while we talked. He remarked with a 	smile in explanation of our audience: I 	have no secrets from my friends.  [QUESTION:] 	What exactly does the Congress stand for—Dominion Status or 	Independence?  Mr. 	Gandhi thought for a moment, and then, peering at me keenly through 	his glasses, replied:  	I can realize the Britisher’s difficulty in understanding our 	point of view, but I am glad that he is trying to. My position is 	very clear. To me Dominion Status means Independence. Others have 	been led, through suspicion of Britain’s good faith, and partly 	also, I am afraid,      
 for their own party purposes, to make a distinction between the two. But it has been largely a battle of words. There is no real room for misunderstanding as to what I personally—and the Congress—stand for. We want Home Rule—a Freedom Constitution built up by our- selves—something not imposed from without. The Nehru Constitution is of our own making. If that is accepted it means that we become partners at will and makers of our own destiny.
 In that case why did you make what the British people cannot but consider a surrender on your part to those to whom Independence is not the same thing as Dominion Status and frankly implies severance of the British connection ?
 Mr. Gandhi pondered the question carefully before he replied.
 I have in a sense made a surrender to those who are considered “the extremists”, but it has been a surrender on points which do not seem to me to affect the real position. There has been no surrender of the principle for which I have always stood and always will stand. Severance on any account is not my goal. Power for severance when desired is.
 You have, nevertheless, added to your demand for Home Rule on the basis of the Nehru Report a time-limit which you must know to be an impossible one. You have, in effect, presented a pistol at the head of the British Parliament. You declare that unless the Nehru Report is adopted by the 31st of December this year something dreadful is going to happen.
 Mr. Gandhi shook his head and said quietly:
 You are wrong. We are not in a position to point a pistol at the head of the British Parliament—and I cannot agree with you that the time-limit we have laid down is an impossible one. If Britain today were threatened with another war she would face the situation and deal with it at once. But the Indian situation is not considered serious enough to warrant immediate handling. That is where Britain has been making a very big mistake. She does not consider the Indian situation sufficiently important. It is a minor affair in the business of the Empire, a minor affair that can be put off and off, to be  attended to some day when there is nothing else to worry about. That is what we resent, and that is what is aggravating this tragic suspicion that is poisoning the whole atmosphere of our political life. Let the leaders of the British people make some definite, serious and sincere move to meet us within the year and then ultimatums and time-limits need not matter.
 If the British Parliament has not conceded the Nehru Constitution by the 31st of December what is going to happen?
 Mr. Gandhi smiled [and, said:]
I am an incorrigible optimist. Up to midnight on the 31st of
 December 1929, I shall be hoping and hoping—and praying —that the definite move we ask for will be made by Britain.
 Q. And if your hopes are not realized?
 The Mahatma thought a moment before he answered.
 In that case on New Year’s Day 1930 I shall wake up to find myself an Independencewallah.
 But he has hope and faith that things will so shape themselves that his will not be the responsibility for ringing up the curtain upon another Indian tragedy. Summing up, he said:
 Get rid of the suspicion of Britain’s good faith that is poisoning the political atmosphere of India and the way will be clear for an understanding between the leaders of the British people and  the leaders of my own people that will solve all our difficulties.

SADAN, CALCUTTA","
  
 January 2, 1929
 Mahatma Gandhi in declaring the new block formally open said that two years ago when the people of Bengal invited him to lay the foundation-stone of the new block, he gladly accepted the invitation and this time they also had extended their invitation to him to open the new block of the Seva Sadam which was built on the foundation which he had laid. From that he realized the real love and respect which they had shown to him and he was really fortunate to attend the function. When he comes to this  building  he  recalls  in  his  mind  the  sacred   memory   of   Deshbandhu   Das, the great leader of Bengal, who had dedicated his life for the cause of his country. Whenever he comes to Bengal, he feels the absence of Deshbandhu and thinks within himself: ‘What was Deshbandhu’s Bengal and what is today’s  Bengal’!  The enthusiasm which he had seen during his lifetime was unique and Bengal would ever remember the great sacrifice which their leader did for their good and for the good of Bengal. Mahatmaji then thanked Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, Sir Nilratan Sarcar and other members of the trust who had worked hard so long for the prosperity of the institution which would be the living memory of Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, the karmayogi of Bengal.
 Proceeding, Mahatmaji said that the members of the trust had appealed for more funds for the maintenance and further development of the institution. He also joined with them in their appeal and asked the people of Bengal to contribute according to their means to the Seva Sadan Fund. In conclusion Mahatmaji hoped that middle and higher class women of Bengal would spare no pains to  keep  this institution alive as a fitting momorial of Deshbandhu Das.

 The following graphic and poetic account of her experiences during her American visit sent by Shrimati Sarojini Devi will be read with interest:libtech_723_footnote
 . . . I am writing tonight from the charming old town of Cincinnati which is called the Gateway of the South, where long ago lived a very noble woman who dedicated her genius to the deliverance of the Negroes from their pitiful bondage. I have just returned from interpreting to a large audience (whose parents and grandparents knew Harriet Beecher Stowe in the days when she was writing the poignant tale of Uncle Tom’s Cabin) the message of the ‘Mystic Spinners’ . . . .
 And through me the New World sends back a greeting of love for the Mystic Spinner and admiration for the Land whose people are set out on the way of self-deliverance from their sevenfold bondage.

612,,‘BROKEN’libtech_724_footnote,"
  
 A friend sends me a number of Spiritual Life which contains a beautiful paragraph under the heading “Broken” which reminds one of so many hymns by Tulsidas, Surdas and the other saints that I am tempted to give the following condensation of the paragraph.
 God uses most for His glory those people and things which are most perfectly broken. The sacrifices He accepts are broken and contrite hearts. It was the thorough breaking-down of Jacob’s natural strength at Peniel that got him where God could clothe him with spiritual power. It was by breaking the surface of the rock at Horeb by the stroke of Moses’ rod, that it let out the cool waters to thirsty people.
 It was when the three hundred elect soldiers under Gideon broke-their pitchers, a type of breaking themselves, that the hidden lights shone forth to the consternation of their adversaries. It was when the poor widow broke the seal of the little pot of oil, and poured it forth, that God multiplied it to pay her debts and supply means of support.
 It is when a beautiful grain of corn is broken up in the earth by death, that its inner heart sprouts forth and bears hundreds of other grains. And thus on and on through all history, and all biography, and all vegetation, and all spiritual life, God must have broken things.
 
 Those who are broken in wealth and broken in heart, broken in their ambitions, broken in their beautiful ideals, broken in worldly reputation, broken in their affections, and broken sometimes in health, and those who are despised, and seem utterly helpless and forlorn, the Holy Ghost is seizing upon and using for God’s glory. It is “the lame that take the prey”, Isaiah tells us. It is the weak that overcome the devil. God is waiting to take hold of our failures and cleanse away the cause and shine through us in victory.
The paragraph shows how religion at its highest is one.

613,,LALAJI MEMORIALlibtech_725_footnote,"
  
 After consultation with several friends interested in the Lalaji Memorial we have decided to devote the collections to the following objects:
  Four 	lakhs and twenty 	five thousand for 	the maintenance of 	the Servants of 	the People Society.  Twenty 	five thousand 	for the completion 	of the 	Lajpat Rai 	Hall which is 	already half finished.  Fifty 	thousand for the 	consolidation of the 	work done through 	the Society 	for the uplift 	of the 	suppressed classes. 
 We propose to utilize the first proceeds for the first object and the rest for the second and the third respectively. But it is open to any donor to earmark his donation and it will be utilized according to his or her wish.
 The Society was founded in 1920. The object of the Society is to enlist and train national missionaries for the service of the country whose duty it is to work for its educational, political, social and economic uplift. There are at present sixteen life-members who are pledged to devote their whole time and attention to the fulfilment of the object. There are two Assistant members. There are six Associates. Seven members are engaged exclusively in the suppressed classes’ work.
 Lajpat Rai Hall was conceived and commenced by Lala Lajpat Rai for the purpose of accommodating the library collected by him and for delivering political and other lectures. It was found difficult, if not impossible, to hire, at reasonable rates, a hall in  Lahore  for political lectures.
 
 
 The work among the suppressed classes is distributed in several areas and touches every department of their lives.
 It was a serious question as to who should guide the Society and take, so far as possible, Lalaji’s place in this connection. Sjt. Puru- shottamdas Tandon enjoyed Lalaji’s confidence in the fullest meas- ure. He is one of the earliest associates of the Society and was in close touch with its affairs during Lalaji’s lifetime. He has consented to take charge of the affairs of the Society as its president. We feel therefore that the public need have no anxiety or fear as to the character of the future work of the Society and we hope that the appeal for subs- criptions will receive a quicker and more liberal response  than hitherto.

624,,THE CONGRESS,"
       	Last year’s was a remarkable Congress in more ways than one. lt. 	was remarkable for the attendance of delegates, visitors and 	spectators, it was remarkable for the resolutions it passed; it was 	remarkable for the compromises the leaders made and broke. There was 	both reality and terrible unreality about the Congress. But behind 	the unreality it showed the greatest possibilities for the nation. 	The bubbling enthusiasm of the people who knew nothing of the 	unreality was an unmistakable proof of what the nation could do if 	it was properly harnessed and its energies turned into profitable 	channels.  	Pandit Motilal Nehru’s address was eminently practical. It was 	even great for the boldness with which he defended the Reportlibtech_732_footnoteand for presenting the nation with an unexciting but 	true programme in spite of the clamour for unadulterated excitement. 	The whole address is a piece of constructive statesmanship. It 	promises the substance of independence instead of the shadow of 	which one hears so much nowadays.  	If thus Pandit Motilal Nehru’s address is boldly constructive, 	Sjt. Sen Gupta’s is usefully destructive and polemical. He defends 	and accepts the Nehru Report rightly as a step towards the goal of  	complete independence. His address clears the ground as if by design 	for the Presidential address. He successfully explodes the doctrine 	of Britain’s trusteeship and the ‘blessings’ of British rule. 	He asserts that Britain has never done justice except under pressure 	of physical force and concludes by insisting on freedom at any cost. 	To this end he demands social revolution equally with the political. 	Both  the addresses show that there is no political progress without 	equal social progress, if the former is to come, as it must to be 	real, from internal effort and not as a gesture from the British 	‘trustees’ in answer to India’s ‘prayer’.  	Hence the ‘tame’ programme of social reconstruction  and effort. 	Behind the ‘tameness’ lies the battery for storing the necessary 	strength for internal and national political effort.    
 OVERHAUL CONGRESS
 The first item of preliminary importance therefore is the over- hauling of the Congress. It is owing to my hurried draftsmanship that reorganization of the Congress stands fifth in the list in the second resolutionlibtech_733_footnotemoved by me. It should have   stood  first  by  right.  For without complete overhauling of the Congress, there will be no other work. If the Congress which is the salt loseth its savour, wherewith shall it be salted ? The Congress is the powerhouse from which all the power for all the work is to be derived. If the power-house is rotten, the whole national work must be necessarily so.
 The delegates to the Congress were mostly self-appointed. The election procedure laid down by the Congress constitution was dis- covered to have broken down. This was one of the terrible unrealities about the great annual demonstration. If the fight for swaraj whether defined as independence or dominion status is to be solid and real, the re-formation of the Congress is the first need to which the Working Committee has to devote its attention. Let nothing be hushed. We shall gain nothing by a policy of ‘hush hush’. The disease must be made known all over the Congress world before it can be successfully tackled. Every organization to be living must show growth. But the Congress is suffering from internal decay. And even as a patient suffering from tuberculosis often shows ruddiness and plumpness, so is the Congress showing every year the ruddiness and plumpness of a consumptive patient betraying to the seeing eye of the physician the surest signs of approaching decay. As at present constituted, the Con- gress is unable to put forth real, united and unbreakable resistance. If the Calcutta demonstration were a reality, there was no reason why such a vast mass of people as had gathered there could not wrest power from unwilling hands. But the demonstrators had gone not to demonstrate strength, they had gone as if to a circus as sightseers. And strange as it may appear, the Congress pandal was constructed as an adjunct to and in the midst of an enlarged edition of Filis’s circus.
 WARNING TO PUNJAB
 This must be changed if we are to exhibit reality at the next Congress. The volunteers dressed in European fashion presented, in my opinion, a sorry spectacle at Calcutta and the expense incurred was out of keeping with the pauperism of the nation. They were no representatives of rough and rugged businesslike farmers. The Punjab has to alter this.
 
 The Congress must not be used for making money. If there is to be a surplus, it must be a surplus from the humble offerings of poor but real representatives of a poor nation coming to the annual gather- ing not as idle sightseers but as soldiers eager to take part in the annual stock-taking and ready to give a good account of themselves on the occasion arriving.
 If I had my way I should separate the deliberative portion from the demonstrative and spectacular. I should exclude visitors from the deliberative section; or if they must be allowed, I should have an open air enclosure divided into sections strongly but elegantly fenced. Meetings in the enclosure will then have to be held during the early morning hours and in the evenings. This will at once simplify the labours of the reception committee and result in great economy. Artistic decorations are surely possible in an open air enclosure which is any day preferable from the standpoint of hygiene to a closed pandal which suffocates, no matter how well ventilated it may be.
 We are a nation passing through the valley of humiliation. So long as we have not secured our freedom we have not the least excuse at the annual stock-taking season for amusements, riotous or subdued. It is a week of serious business, introspection and heart-searching; it is a week for evolving national policies and framing programmes for giving battle to a power perhaps the strongest and the most vicious the world has ever seen. I submit that it is impossible to do clear thinking or to evolve programmes political, social, economic and educational in the midst of distraction, noise, rush and a lavish display of boisterous amusements fit enough for a children’s pantomime, entirely out of place as an appendage to a deliberative assembly intent on preparing for a grim life and death struggle. Our annual exhibition ought therefore to be strictly of an educative character and its organization should be entrusted to an expert body like the All-India Spinners’ Association. Indeed, it is the only body fit to handle it, so long as the Congress retains khadi as the centre of its policy of boycott of foreign cloth and of economic reform among the millions of  India’s peasantry.
 PREPARE NOW
 If the Punjab is in earnest, it will profit by the  lessons  of Calcutta. It will give up nothing of the glowing enthusiasm of Calcutta but would shed all its unreality which damped one’s hope. If the Punjab begins now in a businesslike fashion to work out every item of the Congress programme, it may even hope to celebrate the attainment of a constitution as portrayed in the Nehru Report. If in spite of its best effort, such a consummation has not come about by the end of
 the year, it has to show its preparedness for inaugurating a no-tax campaign and such other direct action as may then be devised by the Congress. If the Punjab means all this, it will begin by putting the Congress organization in perfect order without any prompting from above, it will enroll members by the thousand and show an absolutely honest and clean register of membership and an equally clean record of its accounts. It will hasten to remove all internal friction and squa- bbles. A year is none too much for the preparation suggested in these lines. Will the Punjab rise to the occasion ? If it cannot, the next best thing it can do is in all humility to advise the Working Committee that it cannot shoulder the responsibility hastily undertaken by its leaders.

625,,HINDI IN BENGAL,"
  
 The Hindi Prachar Conference that met in Calcutta during the Congress Week lasted not more than two hours and had only two speeches, one by Sjt. Subhas Chandra Bose who in spite of the busy time he had with his volunteers and the Congress reception work made time for becoming the Chairman of the Reception Committee of this Conference. The other was by me as President. Sjt. Bose’s speech was printed. He read the Devanagari script without difficulty. His pronun- ciation was almost faultless. The address was short and businesslike. He effectively disposed of the calumny that Bengal was indifferent to Hindi by reminding his audience that it was Bhudev Mukerji who strove to popularize Hindi and Devanagari script in Bihar, it was Navinchandra Ray who strove likewise in the Punjab, it was Swami Shri Chintamani Ghosh who was responsible in the United Provinces for the publication of many useful Hindi books, it was Justice Sharadacharan Mitra who was the father of the idea that there should be one script for all India and that it must be Devanagari, it is Amritlal Chakravarti who is issuing a Hindi newspaper, it is  Ravindranath Tagore who has published the popular translation of some of Kabir’s songs, it is Sjt. Kshitish Mohan Sen of Shantiniketan who has made and is still making researches in the writings of Hindi saints, it is Sjt. Nagendranath Vasu who is issuing his monumental Hindi Ency- clopaedialibtech_734_footnotelibtech_735_footnoteand it is Sjt. Ramanand Chatterjee who is issuing a Hindi monthly called Vishal Bharat. He recognized the necessity of Hindi for establishing touch with labour. He ended by promising to be the first to enlist himself for learning Hindi.
 
 My speech simply suggested that a beginning should be made by establishing free Hindi classes in Calcutta after the style of Madras and made an appeal for subscriptions on the spot.
 A resolution was passed forming a Committee, at least for one year, for the purpose of carrying on Hindi propaganda in Bengal with a view to making it a permanent body. The Committee consists of Sjt. Ghanshyamdas Birla who has consented to act as Treasurer, Sjt Subhas Chandra Bose, Sjt. Prabhu Dayal, Sjt. Satish Chandra Das Gupta, Sjt Banarasidas Chaturvedi, Editor, Vishal Bharat, Sjt. Ranglal Jajodia, Sjt. Baijnath Kedia, Sjt. Mahavirprasad Poddar and Baba Raghavdas, Prachar Mantri, Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. The following have offered their services as part-time honorary Hindi teachers:
Sjt. Satyadev	Sjt. Devadatt
Sjt. Ramshankar	Sjt. Madanlal
Sjt. V. K. Ghosh	Sjt. Rameshchandra
Sjt. Bhajavaram	Sjt. Vikasitji
 Sjt. Rajaram Pande	Sjt. Krishna Gopal Tewari There was a handsome response to the appeal for collections,
over Rs. 3,000 having been collected on the spot.
 Those who offered their services as teachers were duly warned by me of the responsibility they shouldered. They were to be not merely Hindi teachers but interpreters of Indian culture and Indian purity. Hindi was to be taught not merely as any language but as the national language. As Hindi for Hindus it was a language of religion and morals. Millions could not be expected to learn Sanskrit but they could receive the message of the Vedas through Tulsidas, Surdas, Kabir and a host of other saints who kept the well of religion unde- filed. They were moreover to teach Hindi as also Hindustani, not as a rival to Urdu. It was to be a blend of Hindi and Urdu. They had therefore to be repositories of purity of character and strength of purpose. Theirs was a noble mission demanding nobility of conduct.
 In spite of a resolution of the Congress and its constitution the Congress proceedings are still often carried on in English for the benefit principally of the delegates from the South and Bengal. If in both the provinces those who propose to do national work make full use of the facilities provided in these provinces, the way will be clear for the forthcoming Congress to conduct its proceedings wholly in Hindi-Hindustani—surely a consummation devoutly to be wished for in view especially of the momentous resolution of the Calcutta Con- gress. There is no independence for the masses if their represen-tatives cannot conduct their proceedings in the national language. When the true yearning for swaraj comes, there will be no need for English
 speech in the national assembly. English will still have its place and a place of importance at that. It will be and must remain the language of international diplomacy and intercourse. But it must not be allowed to usurp the function of the national language.

626,,NOTES,"
  
 KHADI BHANDAR IN CALCUTTA
 A khadi bhandar was opened in Calcutta, 251 Harrison Road, by me on new year’s day in the presence of Pandit Malaviyaji. The bhan- dar owes its origin to a conversation I had at Wardha with Sjt. Ghan- shyamadas Birla. He and his brothers are noted for their silent muni- ficent charities. Among the many causes helped by Sjt. Ghansh- yamdas khadi has been one. I have always felt the need of a depot that would relieve the pressure, in times of need, on production centres which are generally made responsible by the All-India Spinners’ Association for the sale of the khadi they manufacture. I suggested to Sjt. Birla that he should not only give money but he should also give the use of his mercantile talents to khadi. I told him that if  the merchant princes of India took no personal interest in khadi it could not in the near future be made universal merely through the effort of the clerical class who were largely manning the Association. Sjt. Ghanshyamdas appreciated the argument. Hence the khadi bhandar of Calcutta. It has secured the services of a khadi lover in Sjt. Mahavirprasad Poddar of Gorakhpur. Malaviyaji blessed the effort. The arrangement was to sell khadi immediately after the opening ceremony. Nearly five thousand rupees worth of khadi was sold on the spot.
 This bhandar is in no way designed to compete with the Khadi Pratishthan and Abhoy Ashram which have large depots. On the other hand, it is designed to supplement and support them. My own opinion is that in the lines which they manufacture there should  be  no variation in prices by way of pooling or other adjustment. Such adjustment will take place only regarding khadi received from other provinces. I hope that the public will liberally support this bhandar so as to enable it adequately to perform the function for which it is designed. Needless to say that there is behind this effort no idea whatsoever of making profits.
 “HINDI VISHVA KOSH”
Reference has already been made to Sjt. Vasu’s Hindi cyclop-
 edia in my notice of the Hindi Prachar Conference.libtech_736_footnoteI  knew  of  this great work two years ago. I knew too that the author was ailing and bedridden. I was so struck with Sjt. Vasu’s labours that I had a mind to see the author personally and know all about his work. I had therefore promised myself this pilgrimage during my visit to Calcutta for the Congress. It was only on my way to Khadi Pratishthan at Sodepur that I was able to carry out my promise. I was amply rewar- ded. I took the author by surprise for I had made no appointment. I found him seated on his bed in a practically unfurnished and quite unpretentious room. There were no chairs. There was just by his bedside a cupboard full of books and behind a small desk. He offered me a seat on his bed. I sat instead on a stool near it.
 He is a martyr to asthma of which he showed ample signs during my brief stay with him. “I feel better when I talk to visitors and forget my disease for the moment. When you leave me, I shall suffer more,” said Sjt. Vasu.
 This is a summary description he gave me of his enterprise: “I was 19 when I began my Bengali cyclopaedia. I finished the last volume when I was 45. It was a great success. There was a demand for a Hindi edition. The late Justice Sharadacharan Mitra suggested that I should myself publish it. I began my labours when I was 47 and am now 63. It will take three years more to finish this work. If I do not get more subscribers or other help, I stand to lose Rs. 25,000 at the present moment. But I do not mind. I have faith that when I come to the end of my resources, God will send me help. These labours of mine are my  sadhanalibtech_737_footnotelibtech_738_footnote.  I worship God through them, I live for my work.”
 There was no despondency about Sjt. Vasu but a robust faith in his mission. I was thankful for this pilgrimage which I should never have missed. As I was talking to him I could not but recall Dr. Murray’slibtech_739_footnotelabours on his great work. I am not sure who is the greater of the two. I do not know enough of either. But why any comparison between giants? Enough for us to know that nations are made from such giants.
 The address of the printing works behind which the author lives is: 9 Vishvakosh Lane, Bagbazar, Calcutta.

AHMEDABADlibtech_740_footnote","
  
 January 10, 1929
 As your President has mentioned, I am now so busy with my activities that I can hardly spare even a moment from them. But because of my affection for children and your pressing invitation, I had no alternative but to come here. With regret, I had to make this condition that it would not be possible for me to see all the items on the programme or take part in the children’s merriment.
 I am watching the work done by the youth associations all over India. I must admit that I cannot say that I like all that is being done. Again, as explained by the President, co-operation between the old and the young is essential. It is pardonable if an old man like me cannot work with you, but I must add, “please do not altogether rule out the old”. Bear in mind that you too will grow old and, although we are advanced in age, our minds are as fresh as yours. It is im- possible that your soul will always stay in a youthful body. The con- duct and efforts of one whose soul is always pure are unique and I wish that everyone living in India has such a soul.
 The Government provides for your education from the income received through the excise department. The 25-30-crores that make up the income of this department are extracted from the poor; in other words, the education imparted to you is from the money collected by sucking the blood of the poor.
 Condition of youth in India is the same as that of others. They also have the zeal for swaraj. Some seem to dislike this name and have substituted an English name for it—and there is a duel going on between the two names. I wish to protect you from this duel, because perhaps I may have greater enthusiasm and greater zeal for India’s independence than you. And why not? You have a whole age before you, while I have passed that age and I am on the brink of death—and therefore if I claim to have a greater desire for the independence of India than you, it cannot be considered wrong.
 I wish to give you some advice—and in a field where I have much experience. I merely wish to advise you not to be deceived by names. If I place before you a rose made out of paper and a withered but real rose with only a few petals, you would still like to have the latter though it is shrunken. Similarly if you really wish to test the
 
 pulse of India, do not run after names. Engage yourselves in work. The fragrance of independence lies in work.
 You are at present in the midst of a crisis. A struggle should always bring joy. I have not made a study of the entire situation in your college. But from what I have come to know I think that your stand is just. As I am a staunch enemy of the present administration and always hope for its overthrow, I wish that some good people side with you. But even those who are good cannot remain so in the administration under which they work, since injustice lies at the very root of this administration.
 I have not met the other party, yet from what I have gathered as a result of my contacts, I feel that your strike is justified. It is not strange that your Principal should find the foundation of the Empire shaken by this insignificant strike. If I were the Principal then I too would have, like him, seen in it the fall of the flag of Empire. I hope that you would justify the fears of the Principal.
 When the revolt of 1857 was over, Lord Canning said that they should not be deceived even if a small distinct cloud, not bigger than a thumb, is seen in the skies of India. His warning is justified. I hope that this small cloud of yours is a signal for a bigger one. If you had not taken this step you would not have been blamed, but if you back out now, remember that you will be censured. A brave man fights desperately after entering the battle-field—and would be  ready  to meet death. Spies alone will go looking behind.
 There is no question of death here; at the most you will waste one or two or, perhaps five or seven years. And if this does happen, what are you going to lose? I believe that at the end it will be a gain for you. Do not be disheartened even if you yourselves are totally boycotted. Nothing can be achieved if you do not even sacrifice this much. What even if your number rose from one to ten thousand? What is the value of even those 10,000 pebbles on the other banks of the Sabarmati? It is sufficient if out of the 1,000 even ten turn out to be diamonds. If all of you become pebbles, you will be of no use to anyone. May you achieve victory in your struggle such is my hope and my wish.
 Before I  conclude  I  specially  wish  to  warn  you  that  you must never be discourteous. Do not insult the teachers or utter bitter words. Harsh words do no good. They will only create bitterness. And if there is hard work combined with courtesy, you will do credit to yourselves and your name will be cherished in future history. Be courteous at heart as well. Your struggle is a peaceful one, and what- ever the provocation, you may not cross the limits of peacefulness.
 I hope that Mr. Shirras’libtech_741_footnotefear may prove true. The flag of India, and the reins too, are in your hands. An old man like me has no right to hold those reins. I congratulate you for having stood firm in your strike so far.
 For the sake of the poor, recognize the importance of the spread of khadi. This also is the main plank of the programme framed by the Congress. I am not at the root of that resolution. Its origin lies in the President’s speech and I was only instrumental in bringing forward the resolution.

 DEAR SIR,
 We in the Satyagraha Ashram are interesting ourselves in the question of bee-keeping.

632,,MY NOTES,"
  
 THE NATIONAL FLAG
A lover of the nation puts down his thoughts as follows:libtech_744_footnote
 I have also had the painful experience of which this correspon- dent has written. There was inconsistency even about the national flag that was unfurled at the hands of Pandit Motilal at the Congress  session. There was no spinning-wheel on it. So far the Indian National Congress has not passed a resolution to decide upon the dimensions of the national flag, its colour, etc.libtech_745_footnotelibtech_746_footnoteBut  in  1920  my  proposal  was accepted almost unanimously. If those who believe in khadi and in the unity of Hindus, Muslims and others stick to my original proposal correctly and voluntarily, the occasion will readily come for the
 
 Congress to decide upon a flag. It would certainly be an unbearable and shameful matter if the spinning-wheel is not the focal point in the flag, and if it is made of foreign or Indian mill-made cloth.
 FASCINATION FOR ENGLISH
 The same correspondent writes:libtech_747_footnote
 This is indeed a fact. Not only do pupils and teachers devote a third of their modest talent to English, but many devote all or most of it to English and even after doing all this their greed is not satiated. The efforts to break this spell of English can be directed in two ways: those who love English should stick to it and translate attractively into the national language the literature and the special knowledge found in it and those not knowing English should, despite lack of knowledge of that language, leave the stamp of their own personality on the people and prove that a knowledge of English is not essential for development of character, for intellectual progress, courage or inventiveness.
 Let me point out an error in the correspondent’s reasoning. He wishes that the propaganda to undermine the status of English should be launched through Young India; how can that be? To launch this propaganda through Young India, that journal itself should be closed down. The advent of Young India has proved to be a sort of headache to me. I believe and a number of my friends believe that the success of Young India has, to some extent, added to the fascination for English. Some young men see a consequence in a mere sequence when they infer that I have proved the necessity of a knowledge of English by accepting the editorship of Young India. As a matter of fact, my assumption of the editorship can only prove that knowing English and being a practical man, I have made use of that knowledge to suit the circumstances. The conclusion may also be drawn from this that knowledge of English is not to be renounced. But an infatuation for English at the cost of the national language is reprehensible. How- ever, it is difficult for me to explain this distinction so long as I continue to publish Young India and, as I believe that the latter too renders some service, it is difficult even to give it up all of a sudden. Hence Navajivan alone can take up the task of ending the false status of English and that too not by publishing articles on the need to do so, but by increasingly improving itself, by adding to its usefulness and by proving in practice that nothing more than what is published in it about service to the country could be available in English. I know
 
 that Navajivan falls short from this point of view. The attempt to remedy the shortcoming is going on.
 OBSCENITY ON TRAINS
A passenger writes to say:libtech_748_footnote
 Those who write obscene words will hardly be reading Nav- ajivan and hence there is nothing that I can write here for them. But I believe many cultured people read Navajivan. I feel the suggestion made to them is quite practicable. It is not that we come across obscene writing in latrines only. I had seen such writing on the walls of a well-known street in Bhuj during my tour of Kutch. One may perhaps come across this even in other cities. The municipality should efface such writings wherever they are found and should paste prohibitory notices in those places.

633,,AHIMSA AMONG THE JAINS,"
  
 I do not touch upon the matter of the calf libtech_749_footnotein Navajivan; none should therefore conclude that I have forgotten about it. Two types of people have criticized my action: one, those who are full of anger against me, two, those who are thoughtful. I know that my action which appears to me to be innocent has shocked the second type of people, and chiefly the Jains among them. I have been scrutinizing Jain literature. I believed there ought to be a great deal of support for my action in the Jain books. An expert professing the Jain religion had sent me his opinion and an article in which I found such support. Hence I carried on correspondence with known Jain friends. As aresult  I  have  received  the  following  articlelibtech_750_footnotelibtech_751_footnote.

634,,AVERSION TO KHADI,"
  
A Brahmin from the South writes:libtech_752_footnote
 We shall not know how many such wearers of khadi there must be in every nook and corner. It is a matter of sorrow and surprise that those who wear a cap or other garments of khadi are ridiculed by our own people. But those who have accepted the dharma to wear khadi should be able to suffer it. I remember that when I went to England, for fear that I would be ridiculed, I had decided to wear my hair in the English style rather than have it cut in accordance with the native practice. For the same reason, I dispensed with my tuft too. But one to whom his duty has become clear will stick to it, abjuring all fear of ridicule,  etc.  If  khadi  is  an   Annapurnalibtech_753_footnoteto   the   starving   peasants dwelling in the seven lakh villages of India, the thoughtful will stick to it, despite ridicule, contempt or risk of being beaten up. This Brahmin should never permit himself to think that he is low or contemptible because he is a cook. Neither the profession of a cook nor that of cleaning latrines is low. King Nala had cultivated cooking as an art. Every mother cleans latrines. I hope this Brahmin will stick to his khadi cap, and realize that an essential service can never be degrading.

 "
635,,A FINE SUGGESTION,"
  
 Shri Mathuradas Purushottam writes as follows on how to make khadi cheap:libtech_754_footnote
 I think this is a good suggestion. If there is true patriotism in the country, if the people have even a little faith in the constructive programme, it should not be difficult to find a lakh of people to undertake the task of sewing. The art of sewing according to a given pattern is both easy and enjoyable. There are sewing machines in a number of houses; if one or two hours of leisure are given to this work for the sake of the country, ready-made garments of khadi will surely sell very cheap and all talk of khadi being expensive will end.
 
 People buy khadi in order to make garments out of it. It is likely that many other ideas will strike us as a result of this suggestion. At the moment I place this attractive suggestion before the reader and I solicit the names and addresses of those who know sewing and are willing to sew as a measure of sacrifice. Tailors can make a very great contribution to this work. The Wadhwan tailor, the late Motilal, used to sew for an hour for his livelihood and utilize the rest of his time to serve others and used to teach sewing gladly to those who were desirous of learning. This noble example is there for all tailors and others to emulate.

 "
636,,"WHAT SHOULD STUDENTS
DO?libtech_755_footnote","
  
 A sort of awakening and turmoil have spread among students as among others in the whole country. That is an auspicious sign but it can easily turn into its opposite too. If steam is confined within a limited space, one can make a steam-engine, whose enormous power can haul mighty loads. If, however, it is not harnessed, it either goes waste or causes destruction. In like manner, if the steam that is being produced today among the students is not kept under control, it will either go waste or destroy us all; if it is intelligently harnessed, it will generate great power.
 The strike of the students of the Gujarat College that is going on at present, is a product of this steam that has been released. From what  I have heard, I believe that both the students’ strike and their com- plaint are just. They had participated in the boycott of the Simon Commission in October last and had absented themselves from the College. For doing so, the Principal had conveyed his decision to them that those who wished to appear for the examination would have to pay a fee of Rs. 3. Those who did not appear for the examinations would not be punished. Despite this decision, I hear that the Principal has adopted another policy and is compelling everyone to pay Rs. 3 and sit for the examination. The strike is against this order and, if the facts are as above, injustice has been done to the students.
 But the President of the Youth League says that the Principal is angry and he sees a danger to the Empire in this strike. The strike is harmless, it is a sign of youthful vigour. The Principal can avoid the
 
 
 danger by regarding it merely as a youthful exercise. But if by regarding the strike as a danger and a great sin, he persists in meting out some punishment, harsh or otherwise, what is not a danger today is likely to become a great danger tomorrow.
 Speaking about the revolt of 1857, Lord Canning had observed that in the Indian skies a cloud no bigger than one’s thumb could in a trice assume enormous proportions and no one could say when it would do so. Hence wise men should not underestimate an innocent little cloud but regard it as a symptom and administer necessary remedies.
 This strike is a cloud small as a thumb; but it can generate power enough to blow up the sky. I certainly desire that such power should be generated. I have neither respect nor love for the modern British system of government. I have described it as the creation of Satan. I desire the destruction of that system once and for all. It is desirable in every way that such destruction is accomplished by the young men and women of India. It is in the hands of the students to acquire this destructive power. If they store up the steam that is being released among them, they could generate that force today.
 The first thing is that the students should make a success of the strike begun by them. Had they not started it, no one would have said anything to them. Having once begun it if they lose it, they will certainly deserve blame and will harm both themselves and their country. The worst result of the strike could only be that the Principal will expel the students for a long time or forever or will impose a fine for their re-admission. The students should face both these gladly. A brave man once in the field of battle never turns back. The students cannot now beat a retreat.
 Moreover, students should never give up their good manners. They should not utter a single bitter word about the Principal or the professors. Harsh words harm the speaker and not the one addressed. The students have to keep their pledge and do a difficult task. It will surely have an effect. Out of this will be born the power to destroy this political system; it cannot but be so. Our young men and women should remember the example of Chinese students. Of them not one, nor two, but fifty thousand spread themselves into the villages and in a short while prepared both young and old by imparting  to  them literary and such other needed knowledge. If students desire to make a significant contribution to the yajna of swaraj, they must do something like what was done in China.
 As I understand matters, students are desirous of sacrificing themselves in a peaceful struggle. Even if I am mistaken about the
 facts, the above applies to both kinds of war—with soul-force and brute force. Even if we want to fight with ammunition, we shall need to observe discipline; we shall have to store up the steam; up to a certain extent both have a common path. The Khalifas offered unique sacrifices for Islam, the Crusaders for Christianity and Cromwell and his warriors for political ends. Taking recent examples, Lenin, Sun Yat-sen and others have placed before the world instances of simpli- city, endurance of hardship, sacrifice of enjoyments, single-minded devotion and eternal vigilance that would put even yogis to shame. Their followers have placed before us equally illustrious examples of devotion and discipline.
 We must perforce make such sacrifices. Our sacrifices are no sacrifices, they are only trifling. Our capacity to observe rules is small, our simplicity is comparatively little, our devotion is almost insigni- ficant, and our determination and concentration show themselves only in the beginning. Hence youths should remember that they have yet to accomplish much. I have not forgotten what they have achieved; they need no praise from me. If one friend praises another, he ceases to be a friend and becomes a professional pane-gyrist and forfeits the title of friend. A friend’s job is to point out failings and try to get these remedied.

 I hope you write to Ramdas. It appears he and Nimu are doing well at Bardoli. Devdas, Navin and Rasik are still in Delhi. All three are doing well. Mahadev is in Bardoli.
 Kishorelal was here for four days. His health can be said to be fairly good. Ba, too, can be said to be well. We can say that she shows her age now. I have already written to you that she was with me at Calcutta. I returned via Delhi. Ba came later, having stayed on in Delhi for two days. Keshu had stayed back with her. Brijkishan has come here.

 COW-PROTECTION TRUE AND FALSElibtech_768_footnote
 
 The question of cow-protection is extremely complex. The fanatic, the humanitarian and the economist will of course view it differently.	But the Hindu
 ideal of cow-protection has nothing in common with that of the first and transcends that of the other two.    The camel and the horse occupy the same position in the
economic life of the people of Arabia that the cow does in ours.    Yet the ideal of
 camel-protection or horse-protection never arose in Arabia.    Even in the West the
 cow has more and more come to be regarded as the “mother of prosperity” and dairying has been developed into an elaborate science, but Westerners have not adopted the ideal of cow-protection in the sense in which we have. The cow-protection ideal set up by Hinduism is essentially different from and transcends the dairy ideal of the West. The latter is based on economic values, the former, while duly recognizing the economic aspect of the case, lays stress on the spiritual aspect, viz., the idea of penance and self-sacrifice for the relief of martyred innocence which it embodies....
 
 The story [in Kalidasa’s Raghuvamsa] runs that King Dilip of the famous Raghu line finding himself in his declining years without issue went to seek the advice of sage Vasishtha his preceptor and was told that the attainment of his desire was prevented by a curse pronounced upon him by Surabhi, the Divine Cow, on account of an unintended insult that he had once offered to her and that the only way to remedy it was to propitiate her by personally serving her and by protecting her against all harm in her roamings in the forest. So dismissing all his servants, the King entered upon his penance . . . “offering her palatable mouthfuls of grass, rubbing her body, keeping off the gnats, following her as her shadow, halting where she halted, sitting down where she lay down, moving forth when she moved.” . . .
 Such was the power of the King’s penance and so all-conquering his love that even wild Nature felt its spell. “When he entered the forest as its protector, forest conflagrations would become extinguished even without any shower of rain the
 stronger animals no longer oppressed the weaker ones.”
 
 Thus it went on for “thrice seven” days at the end of which, wishing to test the devotion  of   her   protector,  the   cow  entered   a  cave   in the  Himalayas	and
 was suddenly seized upon by a lion unnoticed by the King who was lost in contemplating the beauty and grandeur of the surrounding mountain scenery. Startled
 
 from his reverie by the plaintive lowing of the cow, the King, ashamed of his absent-mindedness, fitted an arrow to his bow to shoot at the lion, but to his utter amazement and dismay feel himself hold as if by a spell and all his  strength paralysed. . . . The lion . . . told him that all his prowess was vain, since he was not  an ordinary lion but Kumbhodara the servant of God Siva and was protected by the blessing of that God hi consequence of which no arms could prevail against him.    “I
 know I am helpless,” replied the King       but one thing still remains to me. I offer
 my body to thee as ransom for the cow and I beseech thee to appease thy hunger on my flesh and let the cow go.”
 
 The lion tries to move him from his resolve by a variety of arguments. “If compassion is your motive,” he expostulates, “then your decision is wrong, since by your death you will save only one cow, whereas if you live you will as their father ever protect your people against all troubles.” .  .  .  The King       once more presses
 his request. “So be it,” replies the lion at last and the King laying down his arms throws himself before the wild beast “like a lump of flesh,” so that it might make a meal of him.... But instead of the dreadful leap of the lion which he was expecting,
 flowers begin to shower from the heavens and he hears a gentle voice speak, “Rise up, my son.” He gets up and finds the cow standing before him like his own mother, with milk overflowing from her udders and “nowhere the lion!” . . .
 
 And since the King has discharged his trust so nobly she grants him his wish. “Do not think I can produce milk alone,” she says to him, “if pleased I can grant any wish”.
 
 Dilip is here depicted as love incarnate. Faced with the dilemma whether to lay down his life to save the cow or to gain the merit of giving crores of cows in charity he unhesitatingly chooses the former and finds that he has thereby propitiated an angel unawares. His relentless pursuit of truth leads him to the discovery of the true way of cow-protection—the way of ahimsa, of perfect love and therethrough everything else is added unto him....
 
 The cow whose service and protection is enjoined by Hinduism as a sacred duty  is not cow, the animal merely, but cow that in our sacred lore appears as the personification of the “agony of the Earth”, and that pleads for redress before the Great White Throne whenever the Earth grows weary under its load of iniquity. Its service includes the service of the entire afflicted humanity, of all those “who toil and suffer and are weary and need rest”, the service of Daridranarayana . . .
 
Dilip’s way [is] the way of  perfect love	self-suffering and selfpurification.
 It is this spiritual ideal of cow-protection that is exalted by Hinduism as the highest
 
 dharma and with reference to which the promise is held out:
 
 
“Do not think I can produce milk alone, if pleased I can grant any wish.”

           MY 	DEAR MAHATMAJI,  LETTER FROM DR. 	B. C. ROY   SHILLONG,    October 28,1928 
  I 	had written 	to you 	some months ago 	to find 	out from 	you your 	directions re- garding 	the Exhibition 	to be 	held in connection with 	the 43rd session of 	the  congress. 	I confess 	I did not get from 	you any definite 	instructions for us to 	follow as 	your letter was 	vague and 	guarded. It 	is time now (I 	hope it 	is not too late) 	that I 	re- ceived 	them and shall be grateful if I am told exactly what are the 	decisions of the Cal- cutta Committee which embarrass you. I 	understood from Mr Khandelwal just before I left Calcutta that you had not decided to come to Calcutta during the Congress.  The 	Calcutta Congress Committee have so far decided (I am speaking from 	memory)     not 		to exhibit 		any textiles 		made of 		foreign yarn 		or anything 		of this 		nature manufactured in 		any foreign country,     not 		to allow any 		advertisements 		re[garding] the same,     not 		to allow 		the exhibition 		of any 		British goods,     not 		to allow 		any advertisements 		of these goods,     to 		allow the exhibition 		of small 		machinery (non-British) 		good enough 		for cottage industries,     to 		allow the exhibition of 		mill-cloth only 		if the Committee 		is convinced 		that the cloth 		is made 		of Indian yarn.     While 	the Committee have come to these conclusions yet I am perfectly cer- 
 tain that no member of the Committee will insist on the compliance by us of any or all of these conditions if they knew that you had objection to any of these decisions.
 We have set apart a large portion of the exhibition grounds for khaddar cloth I am now informed by Pandit Motilalji that the A.I.S.A. have decided to abstain from being represented in the exhibition. This decision is unfortunate. As an humble office-bearer of the Congress I am bound to see that the Association is represented at the exhibition as also to take orders from my Committee. Please do not leave me in this predicament. Kindly revise your decision and come to Calcutta. We shall not accept a ‘no’ from you. If necessary I will try and close down the exhibition. Please let me know your wishes and I will try and follow them. Only I would request you not to be too unbending.
 I am going down to Calcutta in two days and I shall be anxiously awaiting a reply there from you, giving me definite directions. The Seva Sadan is going on well.   I do hope you will find time to open the new wards when in Calcutta. We are looking forward to it.
 
 Yours sincerely,
 B. C. ROY

 EXTRACTS FROM SHAUKAT ALI’S LETTER
 SULTANI MANSION, DONGRI, BOMBAY
 
    MY 	DEAR MAHATMAJI,  October 23, 	1928 
  I had received your letter of the September 24th all right.	I 	know from the  writings 	in the 	Press that 	your name was being 	dragged in to raise 	the people’s 	feeling against me. 	. . . Our 	Kohat differences and 	other things 	had also 	been mentioned. 	So I do not feel 	surprised that at Simla 	Mahadev heard something about it. 	Here is 	what I 	had said 	about you and I 	assure you 	that in 	giving the 	details of 	the incident 	I depend 	not only 	on my own 	good memory and 	also on 	Shuaib’s, but 	Dr. Ansari or even Pandit Motilal cannot disprove my facts.       I had real quarrel with  Panditji 	at Ambalal 	Sarabhai’s and very 	nearly came to blows, 	as my blood 	boiled when in our face he was heaping abuses on us “No-changers”.       You have forgiven  them, 	may have 	even forgotten the 	wrongs they 	may have 	done, but 	most of 	us cannot 	do it. 	. . . You can retire from 	active politics, 	being many-sided, 	but unfortunately we 	cannot; and 	I have 	got to save 	my Muslim 	brethren from going to 	the English fold which means death to them and a great deal of harm to Islam to the 
 service of which I have devoted my life.       I have always liked Srinivasa lyengar. He
 is impulsive and open, may be changeable, but he is sincere and good-tempered. Whether his sponsorship of the Madras Resolution was responsible for Panditji’s opposition I cannot say.       In May last I came for the first time in touch with the
 All-Parties Conference at Bombay and, you know, in your presence Motilalji and myself differed so strongly.       Over this reservation of Muslim seats question he
 gave out strong views and we had equally strong views on that subject. You were in agreement with Motilalji and wanted the reservation to go both in the case of majority and  minority provinces.     The  Working Committee of  the  Congress
 discussed this question for three days and the majority did not want the Madras Resolution to be reopened. There was great fear of the collapse of the All-Parties Conference and to overcome the deadlock you had suggested the formation of this committee to draft the constitution in the spirit of the Madras Resolution. Panditji asked you to give the names of the members also and you suggested four names— Dr. Ansari, Pandit Motilal Nehru, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Mr. Aney. On this Dr. Ansari said that personally he had always been opposed to the reservation of seats but the general Muslim public did not agree with him on this point. He would not be able to find time to work on this committee. Mrs. Naidu and I suggested Shuaib’s name
 in place of Dr. Ansari who could not work on the committee; but you said, “No, not Shuaib”, which rather surprised me and I said, “Why not, Sir? There must be someone to represent the Muslim point of view and Shuaib will be the best person.” You said in reply that he would not work and give time or some such words; and when we assured you that he would work, you withdrew your objection, and Shuaib’s name was added and also, I believe, Subhas Bose’s. It is this incident that I have mentioned in the statement which I issued at Delhi on the 4th September on my return from Lucknow Conference. You yourself say in your letter of the 24th referring to this incident, “I do not even remember what I said about him and others.” I never said in my statement that you made every effort to keep Shuaib out. I only gave the true picture of that scene and said that you objected to Shuaib’s name which was proposed but afterwards agreed saying that if Shuaib promises to work I have no further objection. That is all that I have said about you. I did say then and say it now also that the original committee of four as proposed by you—Ansari, Motilal, Jawaharlal and Aney—was composed of men who did not want Muslim reservation of seats, but at the open meeting of the All-Parties Conference, I was surprised that other names were added   to   the   committee,    i.e.,    Sir    Ali    Imam,    Sir    Tej    Bahadur    Sapru, Mr. Jayakar, Mr. Joshi, Sardar Mangal Singh, so that Shuaib’s alone, and possibly Subhas Bose were the only members who could put forward the Muslim point of view, the views of the others being against the reservation of seats.
 
 I am afraid you have been out of touch with all that is going on in this connection. You saw my English letter to Dr. Ansari, but you did pot see the reply he issued after reading my statement of the 4th September in Hamdard and to which this
 letter was a rejoinder. Naturally you would not like two brothers Dr. Ansari and myself fighting over anything.	My  quarrel really is  not with Ansari but with Pandit
 Motilal, who knowing that I was giving expression to the views of millions of Mussalmans, yet would not listen.	It was a big task before us to make them accept
 Joint Electorates which, I think, in itself was a very great gain. . . .
 I am sorry to write this letter  to you.	Ansari is a gentleman and an honest
 man and I love him; but he is not strong. . . .
 . . . It matters little if any action of mine annoys you today or any action of yours makes me angry. We have fought together side by side and will carry the wounds we earned together to our graves. They are a link between us, but I beg you not to ignore the warning I give you. We cannot allow things to drift because that way lies danger and that terribly ugly thing called civil war which means a brother killing a brother. I must stop it in my own way and I beg you to do the same in your way. . . .
 Yours in great sorrow,
 SHAUKAT ALI
