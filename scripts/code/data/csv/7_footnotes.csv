He read Washington Irving’s Life of the Prophet and began to publish a simple translation of it in lndian Opinion for the benefit of its Muslim readers. Hardly a chapter or two had appeared when the Muslims entered an emphatic protest against the publication. The offending chapters only dealt with the idol-worship, superstition and evil customs prevalent in Arabia before the Prophet was born. Even this was too much for them. Bapu tried to explain that this was only prefatory and intended to show the gigantic evils which the Prophet was born to combat and vanquish, but no one would listen. `We do not want any such life of the Prophet,’ said the Muslims. The later chapters had been written and set in type but had to be cancelled.” (The Diary of Mahadev Desai, Navajivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad, 1953, Vol. “Letter to The Natal Mercury”, 30-9-1895.)
