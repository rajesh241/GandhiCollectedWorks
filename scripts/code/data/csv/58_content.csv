UNTOUCHABILITYlibtech_1_footnotelibtech_2_footnote-VII","
       POONA, 
  November 16, 1932 Though the questions that I shall 	endeavour to answer in this statement have been more or less covered 	by the previous statements, as 	they continue to recur, I thought it would be well to collect as 	many  	as possible and to deal with them in one single statement. “Are 	you not forcing people to do things against their will?” is one 	such quest- ion. At least, such is not my intention.  	The contemplated fastlibtech_3_footnoteis 	intended  to  stengthen  the  weak,  to energize the sluggards and 	to give faith to the sceptics.  	It should be clear to anyone who will give a little thought to it 	that those who are hostile to the reform will not only be unaffected 	by the fast, but will probably and perhaps rightly, from their own 	standpoint, welcome it, if only it ends fatally. An angry 	correspondent does not hesitate to say it in so many words, but says 	another correspondent, “it is all very well for you to say, you do 	not intend to do such and such a thing. There are many orthodox 	people who will follow the multitude for fear of personal injury 	from your over-zealous followers.”  	An argument like this can be advanced under almost any con- ceivable 	circumstance. I have led many movements in my lifetime where there 	has been no fast necessary, but the charge I am now answering has 	been brought against me often enough, in order to turn me away from 	my purpose.  	Whatever the intended consequences of the contemplated fast may be, 	apart from its being a question of honour, it must be taken up, if 	the occasion arises, for the additional reason that it is certain to 	stir to worthy effort tens of thousands of people who have faith in 	me. Such must be the case in every movement of a religious 	character. The 	second question is:     
 Are you not setting one section of the Hindus against another?
 Most emphatically not. Some opposition is inevitable in every reform. But up to a point. Opposition and agitation in a society are a sign of healthy growth. I have no fear whatsoever of a permanent cleavage between the sanatanists and the reformers. Far be it from me either to underrate the sanatanist opposition or to disregard their senti- ment. I have no doubt whatsoever that some of them feel strongly that sanatan dharma is in danger. Nevertheless it is astonishing how narrow at least in theory is the difference between the sanatanist and the reformer.
 Almost every letter that I have received from the sanatanists makes these startling admissions:
 1. We admit that there is much to be done for the amelioration of the condition of the Harijans; 2. we admit that many caste Hindus are ill-treating the Harijans; 3. we admit that their children should receive education and that they should have better quarters to live in;
  we 	admit that they should 	have proper arrangement for 	bathing and 	drawing water for 	them-selves; 5. 	we admit that 	they should have 	full political 	rights; 6. we admit 	that they should 	have ample 	facilities for worship 	and 7. 	we admit that 	they should have 	all the civic rights 	that the others have. 
 But, say these sanatanists, “we must not be compelled to touch them or associate with them, especially whilst they are in their present condition.”
 Then I say to them, since you admit the necessity for putting them on the same level with you, why are you agitated that other caste Hindus will go a step further and believe on strength of the same Shastras that you believe in, that is, their duty is not to regard the Harijans as untouchables, but to have them share with themselves all those rights and privileges which you concede to them, but which you would have them to enjoy and exercise in isolation from you? Surely you who want to guard your own liberty of action and rightly resent the very idea of coercion, will not desire that the reformers should be coerced into carrying out schemes of amelioration which you hold to be necessary in exactly the same manner as you would like.
 I venture to suggest a better way. Since you are at one with the reformers in conceding the desirability of ameliorating the condition of the Harijans and since you have not hitherto done anything  tangible in that direction, subscribe liberally to the funds that the
 reformers are collecting, and use them as your agents for carrying out the common scheme and respect their interpretation  of  Hindu religion, as you would have them to respect yours. Hitherto, in pra- ctice, you have not resented the reformer’s action in associating with the Harijans. You have suffered him to go his own way. You have not boycotted him. There is, then, no meaning in your opposition now simply because the movement has become more active and more universal than before.
 One difficulty is still standing in the way. Who is to have the use of public temples and other public institutions that are in existence, and from which Harijans are at present debarred, in some cases legally and in other far more numerous cases, illegally? There is a very  simple way out of the difficulty. If only each party will shed anger and mutual disrespect, a referendum can easily be taken for each village or a group of villages and each city or each division of a city, and whichever party has the majority in favour of its view should make use of the public institutions, including the temples. And if the sanatanists carry the majority with them, they should  defray  their share with the reformers of the cost of providing equal services for the reformers and the untouchables.
 I bracket the reformers with the Harijans, for if they are worth their salt and will work up to their convictions, as time progresses, the duty must dawn upon them of denying to themselves the use of a single service which the Harijans cannot enjoy with the caste Hindus on absolutely equal terms.
 Following out this train of reasoning the sanatanists will see that in justice they should bear the whole cost of bringing into being parallel services, because as I have understood the correspondence and as I have explained above, the sanatanists agree that the Harijans are entitled to the same services that they have hitherto enjoyed, and of which the Harijans have hitherto been deprived. Let not the sanatanists run away with themselves by picturing a condition of  things  as existing but which in reality does not exist.
 Let them clearly understand that the removal of untouchability in accordance with the Yeravda Pactlibtech_4_footnote, and with the declaration of the
 
 recently formed All-India Anti-Untouchability League includes no more than I have narrated. It does not include inter-dining and inter- marriage. That many Hindus including myself would go muchfurther ought not to disturb the sanatanists. They will not want to stifle private judgment or private action, and if they have deep faith in what they believe, they should not take fright, in anticipation of what is to come. If a particular reform has an inherent vitality and has  come  in response to the needs of the time, no power on earth can stem its irresistible march.
The third question is:
 Are you not retarding political emancipation by forcing on public attention your views on social and religious questions, and springing upon the public a hurricane agitation for their acceptance?
 I cannot answer this question at length without trespassing upon the limits which, as a prisoner, I have accepted for conducting the anti-untouchability campaign. But this much I can say that those who know me at all should understand that I draw no hard and fast line of demarcation between political, social, religious and other questions. I have always held that they are inter-dependent and that the solution of one brings nearer the solution of the rest. This does not exhaust the questions which I have collected from the correspondence which is already proving more than I can handle with the very limited  assistance which only naturally I can have. I must deal with the rest to the best of my ability in the statementlibtech_5_footnotelibtech_6_footnoteto follow.
 I would here like to urge the correspondents to be merciful. Hitherto, I have punctiliously acknowledged almost all the letters that have reached me. But the correspondents will henceforth please be satisfied with whatever answers I can give through the series of statements I am issuing, and they will help themselves and me, if they will be brief and write only when they have something original to say or when they have questions to which they must have answers from me, before they can form their judgment on any issue arising in connection with the movement.

 This venture of Sasta Sahitya Mandal is laudable. As there is such a rigorous movement afoot for the eradication of untouchability, everyone  must,  as  a  matter  of  course,  know  what  is  being  done in this direction and how. We want, through enlightenment, to do away with this sin. It is, therefore, essential for the Hindu public  to  re- alize the implications of untouchability and our duty in this matter.

         November 	16, 1932  	I do not claim ability to give satisfaction to anybody. I can only 	try. Sjt. Kelappan’s fast was without notice and therefore began 	with an initial flaw. That will not apply to the contemplated fast. 	If the temple is opened to the Harijans it will not be due in fact 	to any coercion used against the trustees, but it will be opened 	because of the irresistible demand of the temple-goers who are the 	real owners. Take the converse case. If  the   temple-goers  are   	not  converted,  can   any     
 pressure brought to bear on the trustees ever result in the admission of Harijans to the temple?

 November 16, 1932 I have both your letters. I am delighted that the doctor has got a suitable job in Delhi. Your second letter is an appeal to reason, and
rightly so. But there are two difficulties about appeals to reason in a
 case like mine. In the first place, though the reasoning may  be perfectly sound, it may not be based on the same premises, and there- fore may fail to carry conviction. Secondly, as you yourself have justly remarked, a case like mine transcends reason. Nevertheless I have always desired in such cases to compare notes with kindred spirits. For I do believe that with fallible human beings there is no such thing as absolute surety, even about promptings of the inner voice. God requires the purest instruments to speak through, but poor mortals can only make an approach to perfection. And whilst they are confined in their bodies, they can never attain perfection. What I therefore want is with the utmost freedom to discuss with you whatever has been actuating me in the hope that either you will see my  viewpoint and find perfect justification for my action, or some argu- ment or a word coming from you may discover to me a flaw that might have escaped me. I confess however I have no doubt in my mind about the ethics of the proposed fast. I am therefore suffering from no mental disturbance and therefore I do not want you to hasten back to Bombay. Do carry out all your private and public program- mes in the North and when in due course you come back to Bombay I would like you when you can spare a few hours to run up to Poona to have a brief interchange of views.

 November 16, 1932 If, on the one hand, hundreds of self-seeking men have misused mosques, temples and churches, on the other, millions have made
good use of them. If you wish to test the truth of this statement, use
 your wonderful gift of imagination and suppose that a reformer razes to the ground in a single day all the churches, temples and mosques. Then picture to yourself the condition of those millions of simple good souls when they discover that the temples and mosques from which they daily derived consolation and support were no more. I see the truth of this every day. Devotees who visit even the most unholy temples with pure heart certainly feel the presence of God in those temples, so wonderful is the mystery of His Nature, or say His maya. But some great bhakta was inspired and sang: “Maya casts a spell on all, but she is helpless before a God-lover”. If, therefore, you realize through your imagination that so long as temples exist they should be open for Harijans too, your own reason will convince you of the necessity of the fast. My fast is not aimed against the sanatanists; it is aimed against the thousands or rather the millions who are bound to me [by the tie of love]. If the fast shocks them out of their slumber, the temples are bound to be thrown open to Harijans.
 I have infinite patience as regards the spinning-wheel. Your experience of villages is limited to Kutch. But conditions in the thousands of other villages are far different from those in the villages of Kutch. And even in Kutch no cloth can be cheaper than what is produced by the cultivator with his own labour from cotton growing in his own fields. If there is any such cloth, you may say that it is a shroud rather than cloth which protects the weaver against cold and heat or covers his shame. Suppose somebody offers me, instead of water, a poisonous liquid which looks like water, gives it free and even offers to me the glass which contains it as a gift, and another person offers real water but pours it from his jug into my folded palms and asks four pice for the service, whose offer should I accept? You are impatient, your mind is very much unsteady and your  faith is short-lived. That is why you get irritated every now and then. But this is not your true nature. It is a disease in you. Get rid of it, Your truenature is capable of patience and iron firmness of mind. One need not put faith in anything too readily, but once we have put faith in a thing after the most careful thought, we must cling to it as tenaciously
 as does a black ant to a jar of jaggery. “Better lose one’s life rather than break one’s plighted word.” I think I have written enough now.

9,"November 	17, 1932",STATEMENT ON UNTOUCHABILITY-VIII,"
    
 
 
POONA
  November 	17, 1932 Here 	is another question that many correspondents have asked:  You 	say you believe in the Shastras. We do not understand what you mean 	by them, for you seem arbitrarily to reject many things which are 	supported by the Shastras. Even the Gita 	that you swear by 	requires one to follow the Shastras. I 	must repeat what I have said in a previous statementlibtech_11_footnotelibtech_12_footnotethat 	for  	me, nothing that is inconsistent with the main theme of the Gita 	is Shastra, no matter where it is found printed. If I do not 	shock my orthodox friends, I would like to make my meaning clearer 	still. Nothing that is inconsistent with the universally accepted 	first prin- ciples of morality has for me the authority of the 	Shastras. They are designed not to supersede, but to sustain the 	first principles, and the Gita is all-sufficing for me, 	because it not only conforms to the first principles, but gives you 	reasons for adherence to them at any cost. But for this Golden Rule 	that I have suggested, laymen like me would flounder in the midst of 	a forest of conflicting texts and a pile of nicely printed and 	equally nicely bound Sanskrit volumes, for which rival pundits claim 	divine authority.  	Thus, there are many Smritis, some of which are unknown 	outside the little areas in which, by a few hundred men they are 	held in veneration. No one can give their origin or the dates of 	their com- position. I saw one such volume in the South. When I 	inquired of the learned scholar friends about this volume, they told 	me that they had no knowledge of it.  	There are numerous  Agamaslibtech_13_footnotewhich when examined, contradict one another and which 	have no binding effect outside the little areas where they find 	acceptance.  	If all these books were to be held as binding on the Hindus, there 	is hardly an immoral practice for which it would be difficult to 	find Shastric sanction, and even in the hoary Manusmriti from 	which if the verses of doubtful authenticity are not expurgated, one 	would discover several texts contradicting the loftiest morals and 	teachingsto     
 be found spread throughout that great book. Therefore the meaning I have given to the word ‘Shastras’ in the Bhagavad Gita, wherein it occurs only in one context, is not any book or set of laws outside the Gita itself, but it means right conduct embodied in a living authority.
 I know that this is not likely to satisfy the critic, and as a layman I can give no lead to anybody, but I can satisfy the curiosity of my critics by telling them what I mean exactly by the Shastras.
Another question put with equal persistence is this:
 What do you mean by divine guidance or the inner voice, and how would you and for that matter the world, fare, if every one claimed such guidance for himself and each acted in a manner wholly different from his neighbours?
This is a fair question, and we would come to a pretty pass if
 divinity had made no provision by way of self-protection. Whilst, therefore, all may lay the claim, some alone will be able to justify it. A person falsely claiming to act under divine inspiration or the promptings of the inner voice without having any such, will fare worse than the one falsely claiming to act under the authority of an earthly sovereign. Whereas the latter on being exposed will escape with injury to his body the former may perish body and soul together.
 Charitable critics impute no fraud to me, but suggest that I am highly likely to be acting under some hallucination. The result for me, even then, will not be far different from what it would be, if I was laying a false claim. A humble seeker that I claim to be has need to be most cautious and to preserve the balance of mind. He has to reduce himself to zero before God will guide him. Let me not labour this point.
 The claim I have made is neither extraordinary, nor exclusive. God will rule the lives of all those who will surrender themselves with- out reservation to Him. In the language of the Gita, God acts through those who have acquired complete detachment, i.e., self- effacement here.
 There is no question of hallucination. I have stated a simple sci- entific truth, thus to be tested by all who have the will and the patience to acquire the necessary qualifications which are again incredibly simple to understand and easy enough to acquire where there is deter- mination.
 Lastly, no one need worry about my claim. What I am asking the people to do is capable of being verified by reason. Even when
 I disappear from the scene, untouchability will have to be removed. Whether the fast is divinely inspired or not, need not be a matter of concern even to my closest associates. They may, out of affection for me, work with double zeal in the cause. That would [not] be a  calamity, even if it was found that the fast was the foolish act of a self-willed friend. Those who have neither affection for, nor faith in, me will remain unmoved by it. Constant harping, therefore, on the contemplated fast or my claim in regard thereto, is calculated to befog the public mind and the attention from the great work before the nation.
 I would therefore conclude this statement by drawing the readers’ attention to a few pictures that I have picked up from the voluminous correspondence in my possession.
 Here is one from Vile Parle, suburb of Bombay, inhabited by well-to-do Hindus among others. The suburb has in round figures, 1,700 villas or houses; the Municipality has an income of Rs. 70,000 of which Rs. 31,000 are spent for conservancy. The scavengers are accommodated in quarters where there are no roads, no arrangement for water-supply and no sanitary convenience. The land itself is low-lying, the huts are hovels constructed from dilapidated tins which were once used for conservancy work. There is no lighting,  and nearby is the dumping ground for all the suburban rubbish which gives an eternal stench. Next to it is a structure for housing con- servancy; attached to this is a water-pipe for washing dirty tins, and if the overseer is well disposed he would allow the scavengers to help themselves to water from the pipe; on the other side, is a row of carts that receive the buckets collected from the privies of households. It is in these surroundings that the scavengers have to pass their life. These quarters are surrounded by fields which are often under water, bree- ding mosquitoes, harbouring scorpions, snakes, field-rats. Thirty- one families live in this condition, they are composed of 35 men, 25 women, 34 boys and 15 girls.
 Of this population of 109, only 9 boys can at all read and write with difficulty. The rest are utterly illiterate. This is a suburb where if the inhabitants, if they had any thought for these fellow-beings of theirs, could well afford to provide for them decent accommodation in decent quarters with lighting and water and other conveniences which are part of city life. There is work here for both the sanatanists and the reformers. It would be no answer to my complaint that the Vile Parle
 Municipality has an income of only Rs. 70,000 out of which it spends the princely sum of Rs. 31,000 on conservancy. I know that the inhabitants of Vile Parle are well-to-do enough to tax themselves specially on behalf of these useful servants of society. But I would regard that as a slow process. It is the primary duty of the Hindu habitants to make decent collections overnight and provide suitable quarters and other conveniences for the scavengers. If they did so, even then it would be a tardy performance of a simple duty done to fellowmen. When they have done this, there would be a point in their moving the Municipality to take up the burden of additional annual expenditure that would undoubtedly have to be incurred in order to enable the scavengers to live in comparative comfort.
 An almost identical picture has been drawn by Sjt. A.  V. Thakkar, the tireless Secretary of the All-India [Anti-] Untouchability League, of scavengers’ quarters he has inspected during his travels undertaken on behalf of the League. He gives a harrowing tale about the condition of such quarters in Danapur and other places about Patna in Bihar. Now I wish that instead of engaging in fruitless contro- versy about what is not contained in the Shastras about untouchability, everyone of us would apply ourselves to ameliorating the conditions of the so-called untouchables. There is work enough and to spare for all my learned correspondents who almost without exception have assured me that they yield to no one in their desire to better their material and moral conditions.

  	Not that I cannot use the right hand but it is better to use the 	left. I have begun this before the morning prayer just making use of 	the odd minutes before the little family gathers together. You 	should not be surprised if you find my letters shorter than usual. 	The Harijan work has become too heavy to allow of anything else 	being done. The mere reading of the voluminous correspondence takes 	over two hours. The (here comes Mahadev) (I resume after the prayer) 	interviews take    
 from two to three hours. Therefore I must reduce the other work. Since the doctors here are firmly of opinion that the elbows have nothing wrong about them except that they require rest from the spinning motion, I have cut off the wheel altogether and just do the takli forabout half an hour. The takli requires the use of other muscles. This compulsory saving of time has come when it was just wanted. (There was another interruption here for the drink and fruit, dressing and eating.)
 I do not mind your omission of salt. Take it again when the benefit of abstention has been exhausted. I do not know if juwari or bajri chapati will suit you.

But the latter has little to do with the increase. I am taking nearly an ounce of fresh, dried milk. This is called mavolibtech_17_footnotelibtech_18_footnotein Marathi and Gujarati. You evaporate the water. It should prove heavy. But for me it seems to have come as a godsend. It is too late to pronounce upon its efficacy.

 Many happy returns of the day. This trite wish requires modi- fication in your case. I do not want a return of the day to find you in the same state of suspended animation you are in now. I want the day to return to see you hale and hearty. And you have a whole year to do that very simple thing. Be good and do it.
 Sardar did justice to your oranges yesterday, I did it this  morning and Mahadev says I leave him no time think of such meaties. But he says he is going to taste them. It certainly pays to be  a Mahatma. I get fruit and flowers from slaves like you when it is their birthday and also when it is mine.libtech_24_footnote

  	I liked your question about cow-protection. Giving up milk 	altogether is no doubt our ideal; but I do not think that we can act 	upon it now. Hence, at present, our ideal should be to maintain in 	the Ashram as many cows as possible, and to provide as much milk as 	we can. We do not have the necessary stability in the Ashram for 	that, but when conditions become stable, I am eager to do a good 	deal of work in that field. God willing, I shall be able to do it. I 	certainly think it morally wrong to get milk from weak cows. At 	present we cannot escape that. In India, we get milk from really 	healthy cows at very few places. The fact is that Hinduism is in a 	state of utter confusion. Though cow-protection is one of the 	pillars on which  Hinduism stands, nowhere in the world is the 	condition of cows more wretched than in India. But you need not 	think too much about this and worry. If you do your present duty, 	you will have done everything that is possible for you.  	That your constipation is not yet cured indicates that your 	intestines have become very weak. The disease has struck deep roots. 	Whenever you do not pass stool and get headache, eat only vegetables 	if fruits are not available. You will not get fever or headache 	then, will get some nourishment at least and will probably be able 	to pass stool.  I am sure that you can get many varieties of leafy 	vegetables in the Ashram just now. If, however, you find that the 	place does not suit you, you may even go and stay in Rajkot for a 	while after consulting Chhaganlal. The experience will be useful to 	you and the water of Rajkot may even suit you.  Blessings 	from  BAPU    From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 6743. Also C.W. 4486.

         DEAR 	COL. DOYLE,       November 	18, 1932 
  	Knowing that Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj was suffering from cough for some 	time and knowing also that he had ear trouble which was suspected to 	be tubercular, I had telegraphed to him suggesting that he should 	send for his special adviser Dr. Modi, the ear and throat specialist 	of Bombay.libtech_38_footnoteHe 	telegraphs as follows:  Received 	General condition same.

This 	was received on the 15th instant. Since then I have received  	his usual letter also in which he gives me more information about 	his illness and his diet. I know what a serious view Dr. Modi takes 	of the ear trouble. He wants Jamnalalji to take a liberal diet. 	Jamnalalji is himself used to fruit. He has lost nearly 40 lb. in 	weightsince his admission. I venture to think therefore that he 	should he transferred where he can have better climate and prompt 	expert medical assis- tance, that he should have frequent access to 	his special medical ad- visers, and that meanwhile there should be 	no restriction as to the choice of food, all extras being paid for 	by Jamnalalji if the Govern-      
 ment so desire. May I request urgent attention to this matter?

[From Gujarati]  Bapuna 	Patro—4: Manibehn Patelne, 	p. 90         November 	19, 1932  DEAR 	MAJOR BHANDARI,  	You have kindly showed me a memorandum from Government in connection 	with my interviewlibtech_40_footnotelibtech_41_footnotewith the correspondent of The Hindu 	which refers to Lord Sankey’s letter. In the light of that 	memorandum  I have read and re-read the Government of India’s 	decision on my letters requesting facilities in regard to visitors 	and correspondence on removal of untouchability. I can see 	absolutely no inconsistency between the undertaking given by me and 	the reference to Lord Sankey’s letter in the interview. It would 	be found on a perusal of the     
 interview that rather than in any shape or form depart from my under- taking I have expressed my inability, because of the undertaking, to deal with the letter except through the Government.
 I am however grateful to Government for having drawn my attention to what they consider is inconsistency between my under- taking and the reference to Lord Sankey’s letter in the interview in question. I would add that I am carrying out the undertaking in most difficult circumstances. Questions crop up in the course of interviews which have a vital bearing upon untouchability work, but which strictly speaking would be outside untouchability. I rigorously refrain from answering them even at the risk of being misunderstood and the cause [of] suffering. As it is, generally either you or the Jailor has been present at the interviews. You or he will perhaps bear me out when I state that I have scrupulously refused to give my opinion on any matter outside untouchability and have even refused to receive visitors, whether Indian or European, when I have known that they could not have anything important to say on untouchability or when they have desired a discussion on the political aspect of untoucha- bility. I feel that in doing the last thing I have gone beyond the letter of the Government of India’s decision and my undertaking, but I know that the spirit of them would exclude discussion even on the political aspect of untouchability. I have here in mind the corres-pon- dence I am carrying on with Mr. Jenkins.
 Nevertheless if this reply does not satisfy the Government I suggest their sending an official to discuss with me exactly what the Government would have me to do in matters such as the one which is the subject-matter of this correspondence. And if consistently with my work I can carry out their wishes I would do so with great pleasure. My one desire in the midst of the extraordinary facilities given to me in extraordinary circumstances is, if it is at all possible, to earn at the end of the chapter a certificate from Government that the undertaking given by me had been carried out in an honourable manner.
 Yours sincerely,

25,"November 	19, 1932",LETTER TO ANANDSHANKAR B. DHRUVA,"
         November 	19, 1932  	You have always been diffident about yourself. You were no less 	diffident when you got an offer to go to Banaras. But see, how many 	years have you spent there? And who knows for how many more years 	still you may remain there? Your diffidence is not likely to have 	any effect on me. Rajaji has advanced a very sound argument against 	Malaviyaji’s going to the South. So long as he has not opened the 	Kashi Vishvanath Temple (for Harijans), the pundits of the South 	will not listen to him. They will ask him to open that temple before 	going to the South. We should not put him in that awkward position. 	Moreover, Rajaji has also argued that, in view of Malaviyaji’s 	indifferent health, we should not ask him to undertake such a long 	journey. If, therefore, Malaviyaji agrees, you should immediately 	start as his representative. Don’t mind if the people do not 	listen to you. But I don’t think that is likely to happen. So much 	about your tour of the South.  	Now, about the correct interpretation of the Shastras. I send with 	this some of the literature on the subject given to me. Go through 	it carefully and draft a well-reasoned reply as soon as you can and    
 obtain on it signatures of all the pundits whom you can persuade to join with you. The reply should be in Sanskrit, Hindi and English. It should be addressed to four types of readers: to the honest sanatanists, to impartial students who wish to know the truth, to persons who are working for the removal of untouchability and to whom your statement can be a great help in meeting the arguments of the sanatanists and, last, to non-Hindus who should know that the true sanatana dharma does not consider anybody as untouchable from birth and that, if in certain circumstances, a person is considered untouchable, he or she soon becomes touchable again. You should also point out that the oppression to which the untouchables are subjected today has no sanction in the Shastras at all. I quote here a sentence from a man whom you, I and many other thousands respect:
 In this part of the country these classes have come to be excluded from temples from the very time the people started worshipping  in  temples. Scholars will find it difficult to ascertain the time when the untouchableswere permitted to enter temples. I am afraid, though I don’t take pride in the fact that our religion as it is practised today enjoins exclusion of the untouchables. The people who cling to the practice as a religious principle have the law, the Shastras and tradition on their side. They are the sanatanists.
 You have to reply to this argument. Law, i.e., the law of the Government, may be on their side, custom, i.e., the custom of the degenerate present, may also be on their side. But the Shastras at any rate are not. If you can honestly show that the law of the Hindu period was not on the side of the sanatanists and also that true custom, i.e., the practice of the enlightened, was never on their side during the great prosperous days of Hinduism, you should do that convincingly. Your statement should not be like a pronouncement of the Delphic oracle. Send me as early as you can a statement enunciating such a Dhruvalibtech_43_footnote-principle.

27,"November 19, 1932",DISCUSSION WITH G. K. DEVDHAR,"
    
 November 19, 1932 Mr. Devdharlibtech_44_footnoteexplained to Mahatmaji the scheme devised by the Board for starting work throughout Maharashtra, in connection with the uplift of the
 untouchables in general and the removal of untouchability in particular.
 There was then a long discussion between him and Mahatmaji, as regards the latter’s proposed fast in connection with the Guruvayur temple-entry. Mr. Devdhar pointed out that difficulties they had to face in removing untouchability and throwing temples open to the untouchables in the province of Malabar were much greater than those in other provinces. The Hindus of Malabar were, in the opinion of Mr. Devdhar, very stern in their religious beliefs and prejudices and they strongly resented temple-entry by the untouchables.
 Mahatma Gandhi expressed his desire that Mr. Devdhar, in view of the experiences he had in Malabar, should undertake propaganda work in that province to educate public opinion in regard to the removal of untouchability.

 Norember 20, 1932
 I thank you for your letter. I was sorry not to be able to see you. The way America can help in this internal movement of reform is first by understanding and studying the movement and pronouncing intelligent opinion upon it. Even orthodoxy is today sensitive to reasoned opinion, even though it may come from outside; secondly, by placing at the disposal of the reformers the free aid of experts with reference to the economic question. For instance, there is the tremen- dous problem of carrion-eaters. They will not give up carrion-eating so long as they continue to take charge of dead cattle, which they skin and whose flesh they eat. I have myself tried to find clean and expeditious method of skinning carcasses and making the best use of all the contents of these carcasses. Not wanting to, and not being able to pay for expert assistance, I have been obliged to grope in the dark. America could easily send us free expert assistance in matters such as  I have mentioned, without any ulterior proselytizing motives, if only religious-minded men of America could be persuaded to believe that Hinduism, Islam and other great religions are just as  true  as Christianity and that they do not therefore need destruction but reformation where necessary. The conviction can only come if sober-minded Americans will study the present very big movement.

 BHAI MOOLCHANDJI,
 Prakriti and purusha are one and the same thing because  nothing exists but God. The apparent plurality is only due to the qua- lities attributed. Vegetation certainly contains life but that is vegetable life. The difference is clear. Our prayer is addressed to the form as well as to the formless. Image-worship is necessary for those who desire it. Others cannot lay down a rule. One who is hungry for bread needs that alone. There can be no universal common prayer for all, the very fact that none exists, clearly proves the point.

If by ‘garbhagriha’ is meant the ‘sanctum sanct- orum’, I have clearly stated that it should be reserved for the ritu- alists. I have always sympathized with the Zamorin’s position. Where the law is against the reformer, he has to wait till the law is altered. I hope to develop these things as time progresses. Meanwhile, I expect you to help forward the reform in every way you can.

  	I feel like both smiling and crying. Look upon Santok as younger 	mother and Ba as elder mother. When you made a request for the 	spinning-wheel, I thought it was for the younger mother, and so, 	when the elder mother requested to have it I felt unhappy because  I 	thought then that she wanted to snatch it from the younger mother. 	Now I can see from your letter that I have done great injustice to 	the former. God knows how often I have sinned in this manner in my 	behaviour towards her. She will be unhappy even if I beg her for- 	giveness. Hence I have to atone for my sin silently. You may talk 	about this to the elder mother jokingly if you can. But it may be 	beyond your capacity. I will certainly tell her about it when I meet 	her.

  	I got the postcard which you wrote on the train. I had also got your 	letter about Pragjilibtech_71_footnote. 	You have not mentioned that Pragji had kept  	£ 450 for himself from the money which he himself had collected. 	Read his letter again. In another letter to me he says that you must 	return to Phoenix by the end of December. Whatever may happento me 	on 2nd January, you ought to keep your promise. You should not break 	your promise on my account. It should not be a matter of sorrow if 	my body perishes in the cause of dharma. And you cannot delay my 	death even by a minute by remaining here. Your remaining may make 	both you and me personally happy, but don’t we have often to forgo 	such happiness? My blessings to all there.

         November 	21, 1932  	This time your letter was delayed a good deal. Why should my letters 	also not be censored? After all, a prisoner is a prisoner. It 	was certainly good that you finished the commentary on the  Gitarahasyalibtech_72_footnotewhich 	you were writing.        As for my going through it, I don’t know 	when that will be possible. I am so busy with Harijan work these 	days that I don’t think it probable that I shall be able to attend 	to any other work. I cannot satisfy at present the desire of friends 	like you for long letters.  	If you have read all my articleslibtech_73_footnotelibtech_74_footnoteabout 	Guruvayur, you should have no doubt in the matter. In short, the 	position is this: Kelappan was nearing death. He gave up the fast on 	my advice. It was but right that he should do so. But I who 	persuaded him to give it up have now  a moral duty towards him. If, 	therefore, Kelappan is obliged to undertake a fast for a moral aim, 	I would have to join him. It is not yet      
 certain whether Kelappan would have to fast.libtech_75_footnote
 Since you have said nothing in your letter about your health, I assume that it is good.
 I have now got back the weight as it was before I commenced the fast. All three of us are in good health. I did not get the envelope made by you. Generally the envelopes are opened and the letters taken out before they are given to the prisoners.

47,"November 	21, 1932",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
          CHI. 	NARANDAS,       November 	21, 1932 
  	The pressure of work on me is increasing day by day. The condition 	of the two elbows also requires rest. You should, therefore, tell 	everybody that at present they should not expect long letters from 	me. Probably I may have to content myself with only a letter to you  	and  one  to   Kusumlibtech_76_footnotewho  is  ill.  We  should  regard  this  as  the 	smallest sacrifice that we can make for our Harijan friends. We 	shall have to make much bigger sacrifices in future. Even if the 	whole Ashram gave up its other activities and plunged in this 	movement of self-purification, I would not regard that sacrifice as 	too big. But there can be no renunciation without complete freedom 	from desire. And there can be no freedom from desire without 	self-purification. Any- body, therefore, who wishes to plunge into 	this yajna of self-purif- ication should purify himself. The line 	“Hari’s way is for the brave” is perfectly applicable in the 	present situation.  	But some of the inmates seem to tremble even at the suggestion for 	simplicity in food which I have made. Those who tremble and cannot 	overcome their misgivings are at any rate truthful, and deserve 	compliments for that. How long can self-restraint practised through 	false shame endure? Those who remember the story of the pilgrimlibtech_77_footnoteshould reflect over how the other characters who, 	blindly following his example, got tired in two or three days and 	returned.      
 I do not get much time at present. When I get some, I wish to suggest a good many more changes. If we eat more than we need or eat things which we do not need for nourishment, we are guilty of theft according to our principle, besides harming our health. The experiment which I suggest in this letter is not quackery, it is based on true science. Really speaking, we should eat what the poor and the prisoners do not get only when those things become absolutely necessary in our case. Hence I feel that we must from time to time advance towards greater and greater simplicity. We should learn thesecret of eating only a few things at one meal. Doctors have con- ducted experiments and proved that this is necessary for health. We may eat several things in the course of the day but we should not mix them all at the same meal. We cannot eat at the same meal rotli, dal, vegetables, milk, rice, etc. But we can eat at one meal rotli and milk, a vegetable and milk, rice and dal, rice and milk and rotli and dal. We should never take dal and milk together. Similarly, we should not eat wheat and bajri at the same meal. And also it is better not to eat rice and vegetables together. I make this suggestion because I have read about it and put it into practice. If we follow this practice the burden on the stomach will be lightened and the body also will feel light. Those who do not adopt such experiments with full knowledge [of their likely benefits] will certainly be upset by them. If the mind does not co-operate, such an experiment may possibly fail. We shall suc- ceed in it if we strengthen our mind by thinking that through such a practice we shall increase our capacity for renunciation, show proper regard for the poor, save money and benefit our health.
 I am realizing in actual experience that milk, bread, vegetables and fruit make a completely balanced diet. My weight has gone up to 103_ pounds. I eat fresh fruits with nothing else. With milk, I eat dates or a vegetable. I mix half the quantity of milk with dates and drink the remaining half. In this manner, I drink from two and a half to two and three-quarter pounds of milk. In the morning, I eat mosambis or oranges without fail. At seven, I have milk and dates; at twelve, two oranges or mosambis,libtech_78_footnotelibtech_79_footnoteand at four a vegetable, milk and one loaf of bread. This is my daily food. I have been thinking of omitting milk or bread. I take twice a day sour lemon juice with water and soda bicarb. Perhaps this may not be necessary. I have yet to find that  out. Mirabehn is at present living on almost the same diet as I am doing,
 
 and she informs me that it has benefited her. It is too early yet to attach importance to her experience. Since her heart is behind her experiment, naturally she feels that it is benefiting her. If there is no benefit in reality,  we  shall  know  by  and  by.  It  is  also  necessary not to eat jowar porridge in excessive quantity. It would be advisable to observe moderation in regard to the quantity of every item. In case of stomach-ache, or headache or, for those who suffer from consti- pation, indigestion, one may drop one or two meals, or even fast for the whole day. Nobody should lose courage all too soon. Thebest way of running the joint kitchen without much trouble  is  that anybody who does not like a particular item should not eat it, but without asking for something else in its place. Every meal provides sufficient nourishment. Generally, milk and vegetables will suit every- body. They should be enough. It is a superstitious belief that one will become weak if one does not eat solid food for the whole day. Of course all this does not apply to persons who are ill. They should always get food which the state of their health demands. But I am convinced that if we plan our diet on a scientific basis and eat mode- rately, nobody would fall ill. This should be enough for today on the subject of food. Show this letter to all. Everybody may reject what does not appeal to him or her.
 Prabhashankarlibtech_80_footnotemust have returned there.  I  hope  he  is  quite happy. Tell him that I had got his letter. This time I content myself with this letter in reply to him. I think all the suggestions will be acce- ptable to him. Is Ratilallibtech_81_footnotecalm? Do you know that Ramji has many complaints to make? Amina is unhappy. Ask her what the cause is.

 I am writing this on a silence day after the morning prayer. The correspondence about Harijans take so much time that I can hardly write other letters. Hence only this to you, that you should stop all thinking and do what work you can. When a question of incurring expenditure beyond your budget arises, your duty in this: If you feel that the expenditure is absolutely necessary, you may put the matter before Narandas and press him to permit it. If the item of expenditure is such that it makes no difference whether or not it is incurred, you should not write for it at all. In other words, what would you do if you were in N.’s place? Once the budget is prepared no additional item of expenditure should be allowed to be brought up.

50,"November 21, 1932",INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS,"
    
 November 21, 1932 In an interview Gandhiji thoroughly exposed the baselessness of certain assertions made by an Anglo-Indian paper, which had come out with the story that
 Mahatmaji was ‘going spiritual’ as Aurobindo Ghosh had done, and that his interest
 in active politics was waning.
 Gandhiji says that social reform is very important for Hinduism just now.
 This, however, did not and could not divert him from his political objective.
 To a straight question whether he intended devoting all his time to anti- untouchability work, Mahatmaji said:
 I cannot say that such is my present intention, nor is it ever likely to be. It will be perfectly true to say that my life is dedicated to this absolutely necessary reform in Hinduism, but my life is also dedicated to many other things. I don’t regard my life as divisible into so many water-tight compartments. It is one organic whole, and it will be found that all my activities spring from the same source, namely, my passion for vindication of truth and non-violence in every walk of life, be it ever so great or so small.libtech_83_footnote
 This in a nutshell supplies all the ‘terms’ on which the Mahatma is prepared to accept release. Prospects of his release solely depend on the interpretation which officialdom will put on the above statement.

  	In continuation of my letterlibtech_86_footnotelibtech_87_footnoteregarding 	Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj, I have further information from his wife and 	children which makes me extremely anxious. They have seen Dr. Modi 	of Sir J. J. Hospital, the specialist, who advised Jamnalalji before 	his incarceration. Dr. Modi is not satisfied with his weight and 	general condition. Seeing that he has not recently seen the patient, 	naturally his remarks are based upon the reports received  by  him  	from  laymen.  Nevertheless  when  I  add Dr. Modi’s remarks to 	the patient’s own state of mind as revealed in his telegram I 	become nervous.  	Perhaps it would not be considered impertinent in this conn- ection 	if I mention the fact that Jamnalalji looks up to me as to a parent. 	His children are under my care and discipline. He has himself lived 	in the Ashram off and on for several months at a time. Naturally 	therefore even as a prisoner I try to give the members of his family 	what comfort and guidance I can, within the limitations put upon me, 	and it will be a great relief to me and his family if Jamnalalji 	could be transferred to this prison and is allowed facilities for 	such food and special medical advice as his health may require. I 	would lay stress upon the almost universal medical opinion  that  	Jamnalalji  suffers from a disease which may any day assume an acute 	and even fatal form and that such symptoms arise without sufficient 	previous warn- ing. I therefore request an early decision by the 	Government.  Yours 	sincerely,  Bombay 	Secret Abstracts, Home Department, Special Branch, File No. 800 (40) 	(2), Pt.

  	That you are still suffering from constipation indicates that your 	intestines have become very weak and that your stomach also is not 	secreting the necessary juices. I would certainly like it if you 	went to Vijapur. If, however, your constipation is not cured even 	after going there, then you should eat only vegetables and fruit, 	and not even rotlis or rotlas. You may start taking 	milk after you begin to pass regular stools and, if that continues, 	you can start eating wheat, bajri and jowar. If you do 	this, your constipation is bound to be cured. You should, therefore, 	go to Vijapur and also carry out the foregoing suggestions. If there 	is no improvement even after this, we will think whether you should 	fast again. But I am confident that the complaint will disappear. 	Stop writing about the takli for the present. If possible,  I 	will ask you to come and see me.

 I should give away the yarn for weaving as soon as I have spun enough. It would be best if all the yarn is woven by the same weaver. I should watch the quality of the yarn as may be necessary in the light of the results of its testing by him. Another practical course is to wind the yarn very tightly round the spindle, no matter even if it snaps occasionally, and to watch the yarn as it is being  spun to  know whether it is even.

59,"November 	23, 1932",LETTER TO K. KELAPPAN,"
         MY 	DEAR KELAPPAN,       November 	23, 1932 
  	I have your letter. I wish you would write daily and give me a full 	report of progress from day to day. Of course you will cheerfully 	resume your fast if it becomes necessary. But we must strain every 	nerve to prevent its resumption.  	Do not for one moment imagine that I promised to fast with you 	because of anything you had said in your telegrams. I know that you 	would be better pleased if I did not join you. But with me it was a 	point of honour that I should join you if the fast which was 	suspended upon my advice had to be resumed. After all, you should 	have no difficulty in believing me when I tell you that at least 	during the days of the fast, all my acts were prompted by the inner 	voice. All the movements of a life of perfect surrender to God are 	so directed, and it is my perpetual endeavour to make my life one of 	perfect surrender. Therefore I would like you not to expend your 	energy in dissuading me from the fast if it becomes necessary, but 	devote every ounce of your energy to organizing public opinion so 	that the temple is opened to the Harijans before the due date. I 	have read your letter to the Zamorin. I think that it is quite all 	right. It would have been better if you had omitted all reference to 	the Vaidiks and Tantriks.  Your position with regard 	to them was already known.  	I had long conversations with Sadashiv Rao. He told me all about 	you. I have given him my views fully but in order to make assurance 	doubly sure I reduce them to writing. 
 Our claim is that the proposed fast can never savour of coercion because it is based on the assumption that the vast majority of the tem- ple-going savarnas are in favour of temple-entry. If this cannot be proved up to the hilt, there is no case for fasting by us. Fasting with the knowledge that savarnas are opposed to temple-entry by Harijans would undoubtedly amount to coercion. If we make that painful discovery, it would not mean that we cease to agitate for temple-entry by avarnas, but the movement will then have to take a different turn. I can even conceive the possibility of a fast in such an event, but that could only be in an unmistakably different setting. In order to demonstrate to all concerned the fact that we have the majority of temple-goers on our side, there should be a methodical taking of a referendum of temple-goers, say within a ten-mile radius. And  in order to have the thing absolutely above the board, signatures should be taken at public meetings in the presence of witnesses known to the signatories with their full names, addresses and occupations, together with age and sex. It is being suggested that whilst many people have been in favour of Harijans entering temples, they may be afraid owing to pressure from their landlords or otherwise to say so openly.  I should say that even in that case we must be declared to have lost. Whatever the cause of abstention may be, if we do not get the majority of votes we must be declared to have lost the battle so far as the proposed fast is concerned.
 Needless to say that there should be no coercion of any kind on our part during the taking of the referendum. On the contrary every endeavour should be made to carry on the referendum with the co-operation and goodwill of the opponents. The points of difference between the so-called orthodox party and the reformers should be reduced to a minimum. The orthodox party can have nothing to say against the reformers so long as they do not resort to any coercion. If they are assured that there will be no attempt whatsoever made either on the part of the reformers or Harijans to force entry, there would be no opposition by the orthodox, and even if there is, it is bound to fall flat. Real non-violence can never beget violence. Too much emphasis cannot be laid upon the point that the removal of untouchability, apart from the political side of it, which is settled, is a wholly religious matter.
 Question was put to me whether sympathizers of temple-entry may start fasting a few days before the second of January, in order, I suppose, to force the issue. This must not be done on any account
 whatsoever. Nor, if the fast begins, can anyone join us in the fasting out of sympathy.
 Fasting by you, if it comes, must not take place on the public road. It must be in a house or a hut. There can be no public exhi- bition of you, whilst you are under fast.
 Urmila Devi, the widowed sister of the late Deshabandhu Das, will be leaving here on the 27th by the Madras Express. She will be accompanied by her son. She is being sent there  in  response  to Gopala Menon’s suggestion that a sister from the North may be sent. She has a weak heart, she must not therefore be rushed too much. She leads an austere life of a Hindu widow. She is an accomplished Eng- lish scholar and has been doing public work for years in Bengal. I could not think of a fitter woman for work to be sent from the North. Urmila Devi can address men as well as women. She must be taken to the homes of the orthodox and she must be taken to Harijan quarters.  I do not know where it is proposed to house [her]. [If] no other arrangement has already been made, I suggest the Gujarati house where I was taken during the last tour. She should be provided with a mosquito curtain if [there] are mosquitoes at all. She should be pro- vided with a commode wherever possible. She is a pure vegetarian.
 You must keep yourself in perfect order. There should be no loss of confidence and no work under a nervous strain. We can but work with zeal and honesty. The result lies in God’s hands. Purest ins- truments alone should lead the movement. Give me a list of all the active workers. I suggest that Malaviyaji be not worried to go  to Kerala. He is too weak and he has his hands otherwise absolutely full. You should even telegraph to him saying that if he sends his blessings and messengers it would be deeply appreciated, but Kerala would spare him the trouble of undertaking the long journey whilst he is occupied in national work of the highest importance.

  	Read my letters to Kusum and Bhaulibtech_98_footnoteand then pass them on to them. Kusum’s illness 	requires care. There is no cause at all for fear. She holds in her 	own hands the key to recovery. If she lives all the time in open air 	and eats only what, and as much as, she can digest, she will 	certainly get all right. The only cure for loose motions is a fast. 	During the fast she should drink as much water as she can. A little 	soda bicarb should be mixed in every glass of water she drinks. It 	helps very much in stopping loose motions. The proportion of one 	grain of soda for every ounce of water will be all right. If she can 	digest fruit juices, a fast is not necessary.  	I have discussed about eggs before. Compared with fish-liver oil, 	pure eggs are innocent. Pure eggs are those from which no chickens 	come out, however long they are kept, and which are laid by the hen 	without a cock having been brought to her. Such eggs are not boiled 	but opened as they are and the liquid consumed. They help  in  	stopping loose motions and are more nourishing than milk. If Kusum 	is willing, she may drink the liquid of such eggs. They are 	available even in Ahmedabad. But I realize that no value should be 	attached to my advice. Instead of doing what I advise from this 	distance, the proper course would be to follow the doctor’s advice 	and you should do that. Show my suggestions to the doctor and then 	do as he advises.  	About Bhau, I do not wish to make any suggestion other than what I 	have done in my letter to him. If Kanti has not got all right, I 	would certainly say that his case requires careful watching. That 	is, we should treat his disease to be a case of black fever. That 	means that he should take complete rest, stop all food except 	fruit-juices and, if he really feels hungry, milk in small 	quantities at a time. If he does not pass stool, he should take an 	enema. I 	would be happy if you or somebody else drop me a postcard daily. Ramji 	came and saw me yesterday. He had many  complaints  	against Mathuradas. The latter should remove his suspicions and 	should even tolerate occasional troubles caused by him. He is very 	eager to weave khadi of even texture from the yarn spun by Mahadev.    
 If he is really eager and if there is no definite complaint against him, he should be permitted to weave that yarn notwithstanding any loss that this may involve. About the other matters, call him to you and ask him in confidence. We should not feel hurt by anything he says. We should even put up with insults from him. All this is part of our atonement (for our treatment of the Antyajas). Show this to Mathuradas.
How is Hariyomallibtech_99_footnotelibtech_100_footnotebehaving?
 In Poona, Ramji stayed in a room provided by the Christian Seva Sangh. Ordinarily, there should be no objection to anyone of us staying there. I would even welcome that. But I think the fact that Ramji had to stay there only means that he was not welcomed at any other place. You should have asked him and made some arrangements for him. Perhaps you would have found it difficult to do so. That is why probably you kept quiet. I will fix up with some families who will put up friends like Ramji, and then let you know.

62,"November 23, 1932",LETTER TO HIRALAL A. SHAH,"
    
 November 23, 1932 I was fully aware that the analogy of a dyer did not apply in all respects, but it was good enough for my purpose. You think that the
problem of untouchability has been solved in prisons. But that is so
 only on paper. Nothing of the kind that you suppose is being done. I am speaking from personal observation. Whether in jails or outside, the fact is that in most parts of India and for most of the year, the Bhangi’s dress is no more than loincloth. I myself did a Bhangi’s duty continually for nearly one and-a-half years. I used to do it dressed like an ordinary labourer. In the Ashram it is done with the dhoti tucked in. A person doing Bhangi’s work does not become as much soiled as a dyer. If he does his work scientifically, he need not do anything more than clean himself with earth. You probably know that according to Smritis and Islam, such cleaning is as good as a full bath. But there are occupations in which this is not sufficient, nor is even washing with water. Soap and antiseptic medicines are required for cleaning oneself properly. Such occupations are those of the Chamar, the doctor, the dyer and the worker in a coal mine. There are many others besides these. Thus the cleanliness of Bhangis has very little part in the removal of untouchability. Think over all this very carefully. You should not lose your sense of perspective. If you wish to discuss the matter further, come and see me.libtech_103_footnote
 I did not see anything objectionable in the note in the Chroni- cle. It is true that at present Bhangis work for all classes of people. If, however, Hindus had given them a place in their fold,  their condition would never have become as bad as it is. The status of Bhangis in Europe or in any other part of the world is not inferior in any respect to that of other workers. There are no special localities for their residence nor is there a special dress for them. Nowhere outside India is there a special section of the community like our Bhangis.

 The Zamorin is a good man, not even obstinate, but he must take his co-trustees with him. Only the certainty of the sincerity of public opinion will accomplish that. Women have good powers of persuasion. Let them convince the bonafide temple-goers that true religion will open the hearts of the people and the gates of the temple to every human being and will brand no one as an outcaste.
 Go to Malabar and enlist Nambudri and Nair women there to procure signed statements from the bonafide attenders at the temple within a radius of 10 miles that they would be willing to admit the depressed classes into the temple. This work is specially suited to the women and the Women’s Indian Association branch at  Malabar should take a leading part.

CHI. TARAMATI,
 I have your letter. I had a letter from Mathuradas only the day before yesterday. He is keeping good health. There is no cause at all to be anxious. Since he is to be released soon, there is no need for you to make a trip there. I have replied to his letter only yesterday.
We three are doing well. Dilip will be well.
 There is no need for me to give you a summary of Mathura- das’s letter as it contained only the remarks about untouchability and my fast.
 A woman does not become untouchable by pronouncing her husband’s name. Moreover, we have wholly renounced the idea of
 
 untouchability. You should therefore learn to speak of Mathuradas as Mathuradas and not say ‘he’.

 OF BOMBAY
 November 24, 1932
 SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY HOME DEPARTMENT
 DEAR SIR,
 I have waited almost to the breaking point before writing this letter. Untouchability work is proving beyond my ability to cope with and this in spite of assistance I am getting from Sardar Vallabhbhai and Sjt. Mahadev Desai. The correspondence is daily growing in volume. The number of visitors is increasing daily and more and more time has to be given to these visits as the movement progresses. I am already in arrears with my correspondence and the statements I must make for the public. My difficulty is enhanced by the fact that my elbows are giving more trouble than before and I am not able to use my hands for writing as much as I should, nor have I regained my pre-fast vitality so as to enable me to put in more work than I am doing now. As it is, we all begin work at 4 o’clock in the morning and it continues with necessary intervals up to 9 p.m. The only way therefore out of the difficulty is for the Government to send one of my prisoner-associates to stay with me. The following are the names that just now occur to me:
  Sjt. 	Mohanlal Bhatt —Camp 	Jail, Yeravda 
          2.	,,   Shanker 			Kalelkar—Central Jail, Yeravda     3.	,,   Ramdas 			Gandhi do—     4.	,,   Swami 			Anand —Camp Jail, Nasik Road     5.	,,   Chhaganlal 			Joshi—(Jail not known)       ion   6.	,,   Jugatram 			Dave —Byculla, House of Correct-   
 These prisoners have been intimately connected with me and have worked under me, and they know English, Gujarati and Hindi, which is what I need. If I had my choice, I would choose Swami Anand as being the most competent for the work. He has been Secretary of the Anti-Untouchability Committee established by the Congress in 1929 and since then has been devoting most of his time to untouchability work.
 I need hardly say that I have confined my request to the least assistance I need immediately. If this is a matter which can only be
 decided by the Government of India, may I ask that my request may be telegraphed to them?

 I had your precious letters.libtech_108_footnoteYour criticism soothes. Your silence makes me nervous. Time only deepens my love for you. Our differ- ences appear to me to be superficial. Deep down I feel and touch the meeting ground, and, that is precious.
 I do wish I never spoke of God or the Inner Voice or Conscience. But, like Ramanama, however much it may be abused, it has got to be re-peated when it is relevant, and almost becomes imperative. Truth will receive a deep cut if, for fear of being misunderstood or even being called a fraud, I did not say boldly what  I felt to be true.
 I carefully read the typed notes you sent me. The reasoning failed to make any appeal to me. The implications of the Agamas are stretched too far by the writer.
I hope you are keeping well. With love,

 Mahadev to whom this letter is being dictated tells me that you do not like to be called ‘Hoyland’ by near or real friends—I suppose there are degrees in friendship—but I refused to change the mode, telling him there was no ‘Jack’ about your signature! But after all what is in a name? It is the heart behind that matters and the heart is with you whether the pen traces Jack or John or Hoyland.
 Your letter this time is a book compressed in a single notepaper sheet. It tells me more about Russia than what I have read in my desultory reading and heard from travellers. I must confess that this partiality for your letter is largely due to my faith in the accuracy of your observation and your truthfulness.
 I want to warn you and other friends against being agitated over the proposed second fast. Probably the ordeal won’t have to be gone through. But it is the same thing whether it has to be gone through or not. I am safe in God’s hands and the prayers of many friends in many lands are one of the many infallible proofs that I am under His absolute rule.
Love to you all.

 DEAR HARIBHAU,
 Mahadev has gone through Purandare’s manuscripts. I shall see him on Monday. I agree with you that he may be taken over by the League. I shall discuss with him what can be done.
 I give you below the draft manifesto. I thought that you wanted it for Maharashtra only. I make myself responsible only for the draft. Whether it should be circulated or not and whether it will be widely signed or not, I cannot judge from here. Therefore that is a matter purely for those who are outside to judge. Here is the draft:
 We the undersigned believe that untouchability is a blot upon Hinduism and should be removed. We believe in temple worship, and such believers respectfully urge the trustees of all Hindu temples to throw open their doors to the Harijans on the same terms as to the caste Hindus. We do not include in our request the garbhagriha which is only open to the professional ritualists, and as at present the attention of all India is directed to the Guruvayur Temple, we respectfully urge the Zamorin and all concerned to lead the way by opening that temple  to  the Harijans before the 1st of January next.
 You will show this draft to as many friends as you like and make whatever changes. are deemed necessary, so long as they don’t inter-
 fere with the scope of the request. If you need to see me on this point you should come with Purandare on Monday.
 Yours sincerely,

Shri 	Kelappan’s error was 	a very 	small one. 	It could 	be recti- 	fied and 	has been rectified. If 	a fast in 	itself was 	an improper 	means, I could 	certainly not have 	supported him. 	Since he 	has fully 	atoned for his 	error, as 	his co-worker 	and as 	inventor of 	the weapon 	of fasting, 	it was 	clearly my 	moral duty to 	give my 	support to him.  The 	Zamorin’s duty 	is to support 	neither me 	nor  the 	orthodox Hindus who 	are fasting. His 	clear duty is to uphold 	justice. Two persons 	may fast 	against each 	other, but 	both may 	be in the wrong. 	When that is so, 	the way of truth 	and non-violence 	tells us that 	we should let 	both of 	them die, and 	do only 	what is just. 	It isnot 	we who 	can save or 	kill people. God 	does that. People have 	survived long fasts, 	and, on the 	other hand, we 	see men and women, 	who have 	not been 	fasting, dying every moment through innumerable causes.  I 	am quite 	aware that the personal 	element is bound 	to have 	an effect. 	But should 	I, therefore, 	forsake dharma? And 	if anybody 	gives up 	the practice 	of untouchability 	even under 	the spell 	of my 	personality, surely he 	would not 	be violating dharma.  I 	pray to 	God, and 	also hope, that even if 	millions of 	people fasted against me to make me betray truth, I would make my heart as 
 
 hard as a stone and not yield to them. In considering all these factors, however, we should not lose sight of one thing, namely, that not many people will come forward to lay down their lives by fasting in order to keep injustice alive. The truth is that very few people are likely to come forward to die even for justice.
  A 	crore of 	people may 	act in the 	name of their 	inner voice, but 	they may 	be impostors 	or fools. 	How, then, should a man 	who is really 	urged by his 	inner voice act? Should 	he suppress 	his inner 	voice and 	deny God for fear that others 	may follow 	his example 	and falsely 	claim to 	be inspired by 	their inner voice?  If 	I believe that the orthodox 	Hindus have 	no  popular 	support, why 	should I 	hide my 	view? If, however, 	they do 	have such support, I 	cannot suppress that 	fact and it is easy 	for them to prove their claim.  In 	the first place, 	my political, 	religious and social 	ideas are 	different branches of 	the same 	tree. Hence they are not 	inconsistent with 	one another. But those 	who see no 	connection among them 	should not 	forsake what 	they think to 	be dharma in 	order to 	make use 	of my political 	strength. If anybody, 	however, through foolishness or 	cowardice, is 	ready to 	barter away 	the diamond 	of dharma 	for the 	pebble of 	political advantage, 	should I 	for that reason 	forsake my dharma? 	It is doing 	violence to 	language to 	use the word 	‘coercion’ in 	this connection. 	There will always be 	such powers like 	personal influence and, 	if we regard 	them as 	forms of 	coercion, there would be 	no room 	for determined human 	effort to achieve anything. The 	question is improper.  Mixed 	dinner parties with 	Harijans are 	not a necessary 	part of 	the movement 	for the eradication 	of untouchability.  There is certainly some difference between Bharatbhushanlibtech_125_footnotePanditji’s views 	and mine, 	but I 	don’t know 	if there 	is any 	diffe- renceregarding 	this fast. 	If there 	is any 	such difference, 	however, it is 	for the people 	to think 	what they should do. 	They should follow the 	view which appeals to 	their reason and their heart.  The 	fast is not 	intended to 	convert the 	orthodox Hindus. My 	aim is 	to arouse those who 	have risen above custom 	and realized 	the sin 	of untouchability 	so that 	they may begin 	working and to 	make those 	who have 	no conviction 	in the matter 	start thinking.

  	I have your long letter, the first after you were informed about 	Dahyabhai’s illness. You are worrying unnecessarily. You ought to 	be aware that when both Father and you are in jail, those who are 	outside would not fail to do everything necessary. As soon as the 	condition was diagnosed as typhoid, Walchandlibtech_126_footnotelibtech_127_footnoteasked 	Karamchand to engage two nurses for day and night duty and to 	arrange for any doctor he thought necessary to visit Dahyabhai every 	day, and offered to pay all the expenses himself. They come to 30-40 	rupees a day and are met by him. Thus Dahyabhai gets better nursing 	at home than he would in a hospital. Those looking  after  him  are  	Karamchand,  Chhotubhailibtech_128_footnote(who is constantly by Dahyabhai’s side) and two 	nurses who are very kind and whom Dahyabhai has come to like very 	much. Bakshilibtech_129_footnotelibtech_130_footnoteand other friends too are there. It is natural for you 	to feel unhappy at not being by Dahyabhai’s side at this time. But 	God imposes the severest tests on those who love him. We receive 	daily reports from Karamchand, Chhotubhai and others. This is the 	third week. The tem- perature now does not rise above 102, and was 	even normal yesterday. Doctors hope, it will be completely normal 	from next Monday. I had even sent to you the letter received by 	Vallabhbhai from Dr. Madan, who is attending on Dahyabhai. You will 	see from it that the Doctors, too, give him loving care.  	He is being given mosambi  juice, butter-milk, etc. In 	typhoid as a rule the patient suffers from diarrhoea from the very 	beginning. But Dahyabhai has had no such troubles. So there is no 	cause at all for anxiety. You should go on doing your work there and 	pray for Dahyabhai’s speedy recovery. You should not be unhappy at 	Grand- mother’s death. How many have the good fortune to meet such 	a death? Whenever we feel that we did not get an opportunity of 	nursing someone whom we loved during his or her last days on earth, 	we should console ourselves with the resolution that in future we 	would never let go an opportunity to serve people.

  	We exchanged a few letters some time ago. In this letter, how- ever, 	I have to humbly register a complaint against you. A young man has 	sent me a farce by you entitled Brahmacharyashram and has 	criti- cized it with a sad heart. Sardar went through it first. 	Mahadev glanced through it and read out to me some sentences. If 	prizes wereto be awarded for appreciating innocent humour, I suppose 	I would win a small one even at the age of sixty-four. Co-workers 	like you have also noticed my ability to understand humour. In your 	farce, however, I see no pleasant humour but the most offensive 	jesting, almost bordering on obscenity such as uncultured men might 	slip  into,  during their idle gossiping. One is entitled to expect 	you to produce, from jail, something really beautiful. I will not 	enter into detailed discussion; but having stated my criticism, I 	make this plea, write to the publisher and withdraw the farce. That 	young man informs me that some persons actually wish to stage the 	play, and the poor man is, 
 therefore, all the more upset. I also feel that the farce should never be staged. A person who laughs at himself is not entitled to employ any type of ridicule or, under cover of self-ridicule, to ridi-cule the world and its ideals. This need not be explained to a person of your keen intelligence. I hope you are taking care and im-proving your health there. Convey my vandemataram to all the friends.

95,"November 25, 1932",INTERVIEW TO KHIMJI AND J. K. MEHTAlibtech_132_footnote,"
    
 November 25, 1932
 Mahatma Gandhi urged that there should be propaganda of a vigorous character for the removal of untouchability and specially for temple-entry at present. His attention was drawn to the fact that a referendum was going to be taken by women workers and others in Bombay for allowing untouchables to go to the temple of Guruvayur and he said that such a referendum was most welcome as it would show to the people all over India and the trustees of Guruvayur Temple, what were the feelings   of the caste Hindus. He added that Provincial Boards should identify themselves with the referendum work.
 He stressed, of course, the importance of the referendum near Guruvayur itself and he wanted it to be clearly understood that even if people all over the country were in favour of the entry of the untouchables into the temple of Guruvayur and the actual temple-goers to the Guruvayur Temple opposed it, he would abide by the decision of the Guruvayur people themselves, who should be considered the last authority on the question. He suggested that Shastris of note might also be asked to give their opinion regarding the authority of the Shastras on this question.
 He again emphasized the importance of a census being taken of the depressed classes in the city, specially regarding the education of their children of different ages.
 He also urged that adults of both the sexes among the untouchables had, through different sources, expressed a desire for education and night schools should be opened out for them. He favoured scholarships being given to students of the depressed classes in high schools or colleges so as to give an encouragement to
 
 higher education among the depressed classes, who, after their education was over, might very well give one or two years’ service to the cause of social uplift of their brethren.

96,"November 26, 1932",STATEMENT ON UNTOUCHABILITY-IX,"
    
 [November 26, 1932]libtech_133_footnoteAs January 1st is nearing, the correspondence on Guruvayur is increasing. Instead of answering one by one the questions that arise
from the correspondence, it would perhaps be simpler to answer them
 by way of a mere statement of my position. The fast will begin on January 2 next if, before that date, the Guruvayur Temple is not opened to Harijans on the same terms as it is open to the caste Hindu sin general; but the fast will be postponed, if it becomes clear that the temple-going Hindus in the neighbourhood are opposed to the temple-entry of Harijans or if it is clear that although everybody is willing to open the temple to Harijans, there is a legal difficulty that cannot be overcome before Jannuary 2, next.
 The majority of letters received by me assure me that the temple-goers are in favour of admission of Harijan worshippers to the temple. One or two correspondents vehemently contest the position and claim that a proper referendum will result in an overwhelming majority against such an entry. These correspondents have given me no proof in support of their opinion, whereas others say that they have actually taken referendum after their own fashion and found it to be in favour of temple-entry by Harijans. If the orthodox people will agree, a fresh referendum can at once be taken in the presence of referees appointed by both the parties. I need not repeat here the scheme suggested last Saturday in answer to a question from The Times of Indiacorrespondent. Anyway,the reform party should lose no time in fortifying their contention with incontestable proof.
 They, however, say that, although the opinion of the temple- goers may be overwhelmingly in their favour, the key of the temple is held by the Zamorin. That is no doubt technically true, but he is not the owner. He is a trustee representing the temple-going public. Therefore, he cannot resist the clearly expressed wish of the majority
 
 of them. It is his duty to overcome the legal difficulties if there are any, and if he fails to do so, it simply means that the force of the public opinion has not become strong enough to compel the performance of his obvious duty.
 The fast will then further solidify public opinion so as to make itself felt. The key to the temple, therefore, is in fact in the hands of the public. But as the legal maxim has it, law or equity helps the watchful, never the slothful. Let Kerala reformers, therefore, not blame the Zamorin.
 It is discourteous and wrong to impute motives to him. If he refuses to open the temple to Harijans, let us think that he is not con- vinced of the public demand. His refusal must be a signal not for abu- sing him, but discovering the weakness in our position. It is surely more dignified and proper for the public to feel that it is a clearly ex- pressed wish and cannot be flouted by its representative which the Zamorin is.
 Guruvayur has already become an all-India concern. Let the caste Hindus all over India bestir themselves and declare their opinion that they desire Guruvayur Temple to be opened to Harijans. The moral force of such an opinion honestly and freely expressed will be irresisti-ble.
 I have already warned the reformers against using unbecoming language in respect of orthodox sanatanists or no-changers, as they have called themselves, in a petition addressed to H.E. the Viceroy. They are entitled to their opinion. I look upon this untouchability question as primarily religious, and I would like both the no-changers and the reformers to work in a religious spirit without  imputing motives to one another. No reform, much less religious reform, can be or should be carried by compulsion. I have repeatedly stated in un- equivocal terms the limitations and functions of the proposed fast.
 But a correspondent writing in Gujarati for himself and others says in effect:
 It is all very well for you to say that you do not want to coerce anybody, but your position cannot but compel some people to act against their will. Some of us have no respect for your religious views or your social reforms, but we want you to live for your political power, and, therefore, if you persist in fasting, we will have to pocket our convictions and help you in your fight for temple-entry. If this is not coercion, we do not
 know the meaning of the word.
 My answer is, I must not be expected to surrender my cherished convictions because I hold a prominent position in the Indian world, or because I have some political influence; I cannot barter away my faith or suppress its movement for the sake of retaining my social position or political influence. Everything is subservient to and is derivable from that faith. Ask me to deny or suppress it, and it would be worse than asking me to commit suicide. I would also venture to suggest that those who subordinate their convictions to their regard for my position or political influence can only have shallow convic- ions if any at all.
 Convictions are made of sterner stuff. People have been known to stake their all for the sake of their convictions which may then be called religion. The correspondent asks:
 What is the poor Zamorin to do? On the one hand you and Mr. Kelappan will fast. On the other, 1,000 no-changers are said to have decided to do likewise. Whom is the Zamorin to please?
 I answer without the slightest hesitation that he is to  please  neither party. He is there to please God, which is Truth. He is there to do his duty, and if it demands the sacrifice of thousands of no-chan- gers, Mr. Kelappan and myself, he should have the courage to do so and he will deserve the honour of his own generation and posterity.
 God will take care of the fasting fraternity. Those who fast will do so for defending the truth as they see it, and God of Truth will do what He likes with them. If their fast is in answer to an inner urge, it will be its own reward, and it will be well with them whether the purpose to which it is directed is apparently fulfilled or not.
The same correspondent persists:
 But it is all very well for you to talk of the call of God, the conscience, the inner voice and all that. Others also can and do put forth the same claim. What are we, who have no inner voice and who have no God to parade before the public, to do and which are we to believe?
 I can only say: You have to believe no one but yourselves. You must try to listen to the inner voice, but if you won’t have the expression ‘inner voice’, you may use the expression ‘dictates of reason’ which you should obey, and if you will not parade God, I have no doubt you will parade something else which in the end will prove to be God for, fortunately, there is no one and nothing else but
 God in this universe. I would also submit that it is not everyone claiming to act on the urge of the inner voice who has that urge. After all like every other faculty this faculty for listening to the still, small voice within requires previous effort and training perhaps much grea- ter than what is required for the acquisition of any other faculty, and even if out of thousands of claimants only a few succeed in estab- lishing their claim, it is well worth running the risk of having and tole- rating doubtful claimants.
 So much for the Gujarati correspondent. I must now conclude this statement with a question from a correspondent who writes in English. His is a long letter containing elaborate argument but I think the following epitome correctly represents him:
 Hitherto I have known you to be free from any trace of communalism but you now suddenly appear in a communal garb. I could have understood and justified your fast for swaraj or for  all-India unity, but I cannot understand this fast on behalf  of Hinduism. I have never taken you as a Hindu at all, certainly not as a narrow Hindu. What is there in opening the temples to Harijans, who do not want to go there?
 I am glad of this question. I have no desire whatsoever to appear to anyone as other than what I am. I am not ashamed of Hinduism or of the Hindu. I totally deny being narrow. I fancy I could not be held for one single moment by a narrow creed, and it is because the super-imposition of untouchability would make Hinduism a narrow creed that I have rebelled against it, and I would count my life to be a cheap price to pay for the removal of that blot.
 I have nothing of the communalist in me, because my Hinduism is all-inclusive. It is not anti-Mussalman, anti-Christian or anti-any- other-religion. But it is pro-Mussalman, pro-Christian and pro-every- other-living faith in the world. To me, Hinduism is but one branch from the same parent trunk, whose roots and whose quality we judge only by the collective strength and quality of the different branches put together, and if I take care of the Hindu branch on whichI am sitting and which sustains me surely I am taking care also of the sister branches. If the Hindu branch is poisoned, the poison is likely to spread to others. If that branch withers, the parent will be the weaker for its withering.
 If my correspondent and those who think with him have followed me hitherto, they will discover that if God gives me the
 privilege of dying for this Hinduism of my conception, I shall have sufficiently died for the unity of all and even for swaraj. Finally let me repeat what I have said before now, that the question whether Harijans want to, or would enter into temples, if they were open to them, is irrelevant. The removal of untouchability is not a matter of bestowing patronage on Harijans. It is one of penance and purification by the caste Hindus and one of the penances they have to do is to open the Hindu temples and invite the Harijans to them.

 November 26, 1932 I appreciate your letter. You should study the statementlibtech_134_footnoteI  am issuing today. When I talk of criminal neglect of comrades or refor-
mers, I have no one in particular in mind. If we are true and active, the
 walls of untruth must come down. It is no use saying that the Zamorin is hardening. You will find that if the temple-goers demand the entry of Harijans to the temple, no power on earth can prevent them. The fact is that our agitation is only now beginning. It must be intense and yet gentle. Not a word need be uttered against the Zamorin. Of course if the law is really against us, it must be mended. And that too cannot be stopped if the public voice is clear and emphatic. We must not lose faith in ourselves or the cause. Am I clear? Do not hesitate to write again, if I am obscure.

 DEAR DR. ALAM,
 Your good wife has been keeping me informed through her beautiful Urdu letters of your health. Her beautifully written letters have opened my eyes to the culture among Muslim sisters. I have three such fair correspondents—Begum Alam, Johra Ansari and Raihana Tyabji. Their diction is good and handwriting of two, i.e., Begum Alam and Johra, is like copper-plate. Raihana is a spoilt girl.
 
 Being a poetess, she has not kept up her handwriting to the high level that the other two have. But I must not take up this letter in telling you of my good fortune, part of which, due to your unconditional release, would be now taken away from me, for Begum Alam would now consider herself to be absolved from writing to me. But let her know that I am not going to give her any such easy release. I do hope that your illness has not marred your sense of humour and that you are fit enough to receive nonsensical letters and amuse yourself over them.
 You can’t receive any congratulations from me on your ill- earned discharge, but we must make the best of it and fulfil  the purpose for which the discharge is granted. You have therefore to hasten to [be] well. On receipt of Begum Alam’s telegram I sent a wire to Dr. Deshmukh. I have wired to you his opinion and of local medical friends who consider you to be fit enougrh to travel to Bombay. You should do so and let Dr. Deshmukh take charge of you. If an operation is considered by medical advisers to be necessary, I do not believe in waiting. Please let me know what you are doing and what is the exact condition of your health. May God keep you long for His service. Love from us all.

 November 26, 1932 Persons who are ill bemoan their inability to do anything for others while they themselves have to accept people’s services. This is a
grave error. Such a person can do service by thinking pure thoughts,
 by exacting the minimum of service and by bathing in love those who serve him. He can also serve by keeping cheerful. We should never forget that meditating on God with pure devotion is also service.

 November 26, 1932
 BHAI ANAND SWARUP,
 I have your letter. All the questions are good, but I do not have sufficient time to answer them all. I am not sure when I shall be able to reply through the newspapers, and so I think I may write at least this much.
 Ramanama and Omkar are one and the same. Tulsidas too has shown this most clearly. He has extolled the name precisely because one lacks concentration while reciting prayers. All the Shastras assure us and the experience of devotees shows that anyone can ultimately gain concentration of mind if one goes on praying with a feeling of reverence. Closing eyes while chanting the prayer is enough but it is certainly good if the thoughts are centred on the point between the eyebrows.
 The assertion that God himself is truth has a drawback that it implies some further qualities possessed by God. That God has many names, a thousand, is quite true. But remembering God as the posse- ssor of many names is fraught with the possibility of a diminution in the significance of the entity to which we wish to offer total surrender. But all other attributes fade away when we proclaim that Truth alone is God; only the idea of truth remains in mind and this is more prevalent in monism. Atheism has no place here as even an atheist accepts existence which is a development of sat. Here truth does not imply merely truthfulness of speech; its meaning here is unity of thought, word and deed and yet more. Whatever is in reality here, what existed
 in the past and will remain in the future is the substance, truth, Parameshwarlibtech_136_footnoteand nothing but that.
 Now for the scavenging and hygiene of commodes.  A  commode should be placed in a room which constantly receives sunlight. It should be constructed in such a way as to be removed daily and cleaned. Two buckets should be placed on a wooden frame, one for urine and one for stools. After evacuation of the bowels the excrement should be covered with sand or mud. A bucket full of earth should be kept in the room. If the house is near a field or a garden the excreta should be regularly buried there for being converted into manure. Except during the rainy season, the roof should be re- movable during the rest of the year so that the room receives sunshine throughout the day. With this arrangement and daily washing out of the buckets and the room, the lavatory will be and should be as clean as a bed-room. This arrangement is very convenient in the villages and it should not prove difficult in towns like Meerut.
 MOHANDAS GANDHI

104,"November 26, 1932",INTERVIEW TO “THE TIMES OF INDIA”,"
    
 November 26, 1932
 
 Certain people who visited Mr. Gandhi this week left Yeravda Jail under the impression that Mr. Gandhi had assured them that once the Guruvayur temple-entry matter had been settled, he would extend his fast in order to compel the temple trustees throughout India to open all temples to the untouchables. They have told their friends about this and the news has spread quickly. This morning I sought Mr. Gandhi’s confirmation or denial of this as I felt that a mistake had occurred somewhere. He immediately denied its accuracy. Mr. Gandhi said:
Such a  course on  my  part would disturb public  opinion and
 would be a breach of faith. Once the fast is over and the temple is open, many other temples are highly likely to be opened to the untou- chables because by the time Guruvayur is opened, so much propa-
 
 ganda work will have been done and public opinion will have been so much affected that it is not likely that there will be much hesitation on the part of other trustees to open the temples under their charge. Should it prove otherwise, I should not think of restarting the fast without the greatest deliberation and without an absolutely just cause. So far as I can say now no such fast for a particular item in the anti-untouchability programme is contemplated.
 In reply to my query as to whether he had any detailed information as to the actual situation in the neighbourhood of the Guruvayur Temple, Mr. Gandhi said that so far as information is available the caste Hindus in the neighbourhood, who were in the habit of visiting the temple, were overwhelmingly in favour of Harijans beingadmitted on precisely the same terms as they themselves were admitted.
But I also have letters from people in the neighbourhood casting
 aspersions on the accuracy of my information. I have, therefore, suggested that a quick public referendum of the caste Hindu people within a radius of say ten miles from the temple be taken in the pre- sence of referees, one to be appointed to act on behalf of the  reformers and one on behalf of the sanatanists. If it is thought nece- ssary there may also be an umpire. These gentlemen should supervise the taking of votes so as to avoid any chance of undue pressure being exercised, impersonation or any other malpractice.
 If, however, as a result of this quick referendum it is found that the information at my disposal was wrong I will unhesitatingly advise Mr. Kelappan to postpone his fast until public opinion is sufficiently educated to warrant the opening of the temple to the Harijans.
 Meanwhile he has askedlibtech_137_footnoteUrmila Devi, sister of the late Mr. C. R. Das to go south and assist in the campaign there.

 CHI. DAHYABHAI,
Today there is even better report of your health.
 I said in my letter yesterday that even a sick person can do service. This is how he can do so. He may spend the period of rest in meditating on God and, controlling his impatience and anger, bathe in
 
 love those who are nursing him. I know of one example from the West and one from our country. An eighteen-year-old French girl spread so much fragrance during her illness, which ended in her death, that she has been canonized a saint. She now sleeps the sleep to which there is no end.
 Ladha Maharaj of Bilkha, near Porbandar, was suffering from leucoderma.libtech_138_footnoteHe went to the temple of Shiva in Bilkha and took up a seat in an asana posture. For the whole day he would repeat Raman- ama or read the Ramayana. In the end he was cured and became a famous kathakarlibtech_139_footnote. I had seen him and heard him narrating a katha.
 A devotee of God puts to good use even his illness; he does not give way to his illness.

 After commencing silence, November 27, 1932
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I send with this a letter from the school for handicapped chil- dren for the information of you all. I have written about that school before. I have happy memories of it. I would very much wish something  like  that  to  be  done  in  the  Ashram,  too.libtech_149_footnotelibtech_150_footnote.   .   .   I   was half-asleep when I wrote the sentence which I have scored out. I find now that it made no sense. The love which the teachers of that school show to the pupils and their patience are worth emulating. Anybody who wants more information about the school should write to it and get it.
 If you know the whereabouts of Khadagbahadursinglibtech_151_footnote, please in- form me.
 I hope Kusum gets the postcard which I write to her daily. I could not write yesterday.
 It seems after grinding the jowar, the flour is not  sifted.  It should be enough if the jowar is carefully cleaned before grinding it. And the same about wheat. I suppose you get the wheat ground in a flour-mill outside. If we grind it ourselves in the Ashram we should use the flour as it is without sifting it. If these cereals are eaten with all their contents intact, they provide substances which help bowel move- ment. If anything is removed by sifting, many essential elements are lost.
 Purushottam should not wait there till he falls ill. Wherever he goes, he is bound to get opportunities for work and service. He may certainly return when his health has improved a little and can be depended upon better. If your experiments succeed, anybody can
 
 come and live in the Ashram. I do feel that you will succeed.
 I have already dropped a letterlibtech_152_footnoteto  Bhau.  I  hope  he  sees  you from time to time.
I have also written to you about Parashuram.
I am sending Madan’s booklibtech_153_footnotelibtech_154_footnoteI forgot to send it immediately.
 Tell everybody this about takli. If the spinning-wheel is  the king, the takli is the queen. Without a queen, a king is no king, and without the king the queen can do nothing. It should also be realized that without a queen the royal house cannot go on. If the spinn- ing-wheel is for thousands, the takli is for millions. It is surprising that, though Bhau has demonstrated the great power which the takli possesses, all the inmates of the Ashram do not learn to spin on it. In the past people spun even the finest yarn on the takli. The takli which they used was made of bamboo. Even today. the Brahmins in the Madras Presidency spin the very fine yarn required for the sacred thread on the takli. Making a spinning-wheel takes time, but a takli can be made anywhere. It does not get out of order and makes no noise. It is quite possible that the takli will one day win over the spinning-wheel. We, of course, do not wish either to lose ground to the other. On the contrary, we wish to acquire equal and great mastery over both.

 You did right in keeping back Maganbhai’s and Raojibhai’s letters. If you feel the slightest doubt about any letter, you should keep it back. I have no desire at all to know anything which should not be communicated to me. Any information concerning matters about which I can say or do nothing cannot be anything but a weight on my mind.
I get letters from Mirabehn regularly. She has again given up
 
 
 salt. Since Kisan has been removed to Thana, Mirabehn is once again without a companion. If we give up attachment to  particular individuals as friends, all human beings, and, if we can see more truly, even animals, birds, trees, plants, even stones are our friends. The yoga of non-attachment does teach us that lesson. My weight came to 103 pounds this time.

 I have your letter. You will manage if you do not work beyond your capacity. A humble servant is one who does not proclaim her service to the world and is not proud of it even in her heart. A humble servant does not seek respect from people. Rather, she takes insults, that is to say she suffers them. She does not become angry with pe- ople. A humble servant will not be a burden to anyone, because she knows that she renders service in order to make herself pure. She does not do it to oblige anyone.A humble servant will show herself as she is.

 DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS,
 Do you know the reasons for the changes in food which the Ashram has introduced? Observe the effect of the new diet on your body and mind and write to me about it.
 Bhau says that none of you likes to spin on takli. You can produce a sufficient quantity of yarn and of good quality with takli,
 
 untouchability was universal in its application or limited to Hindu untouchables alone.
 only if you spin on it with concentration and in silence. Bhau believes that you are not capable of either. You cannot stop talking even for a few minutes. If this is true, it is very bad. Takli is very much superior to the spinning-wheel in teaching us silence. You should know the full power of takli and must benefit from it. It is certain that a person who cannot live in solitude, remain silent or work with concentration can never be a true brahmachari. And all of you are brahmacharis at present. Discuss this with Bhau and see that every one of you does the takli yajna.

 after 	the prayer.  From 	a microfilm of the Gujarati: M.M.U./II         November 	28, 1932  DEAR 	COL. DOYLE,  	I have today astounding news that a co-worker of mine, Sjt. 	Appasaheb Patwardhan, a civil disobedience prisoner in Ratnagiri 	Jail, is semi-fasting because he and some other prisoners who were 	permitted to do Bhangi work have been suddenly deprived of it under 	your orders. My fear is that this order was a result of my having 	said in the course of our conversations that your policy was 	inconsistent in that you were allowing non-Bhangi prisoners to do 	Bhangi work in the Ratnagiri Prison and you would not allow it in 	this. It is difficult for me to understand why those prisoners who 	volunteer to do such work should be prevented from doing it. Surely 	you do not want forcibly to keep up untouchability in prisons when 	it is crumbling to pieces outside. Appasaheb is an M.A. of the 	Bombay University, is a great social reformer and a man of character 	whom any State would be proud to have as a citizen. Service of 	untouchables is an article of faith with him. He underwent a fast in 	1930 for the above reason in that very jail. I had even then to 	intervene on his behalflibtech_160_footnotelibtech_161_footnote.  If  I   am misinformed about the present position 	you will let me know what it    
 really is. If I am correctly informed I would ask you in view of the circumstances brought to your notice please to telegraph instructions that my friend and his associates may be allowed to resume Bhangi work under whatever written guarantee as to its voluntary nature you may deem fit to take from them.
 Though I am a prisoner, you will not expect me to see a comrade dying by inches, not for any crime, not for any indulgence he desires, but for deprivation of humanitarian service for the prosecution of which Government have recognized the necessity of giving me special facilities.
 Here perhaps you would allow me to remind you that during this incarceration and the two previous ones in my own humble manner I have on several occasions helped the authorities to preserve prison discipline. I mention this fact not in order that it may be counted as a merit. I gave that assistance as a matter of duty imposed upon me by the law of satyagraha. I mention it here in order that you or the Government may know that in seeking relief about prisoner friends I am not guilty of any officious interference with the administration.
 I am sure that you will treat this as a matter of urgency involving as it does the possibility of great damage being done to a fellow-being under your custody.

The Government now know the 	relations that subsist between him and me. Both he and I asked the 	Superintendent at the interview today whether we could meet each 	other frequently and he told us that he had permission only for that 	single interview. If Sheth Jamnalal had not been suffering from a 	bad disease, and without the cause to be just mentioned, I should 	have been satisfied with an occasional interview like the one I had 	today. But seeing that he has been specially brought to Yeravda for 	the sake of his health, it would be putting an undue strain on both 
 of us if we were not allowed to see each other frequently, of course subject to restrictions as to conversation. I have no desire to hold any political conversation with him. But I shouldwant to discuss with him problems of untouchability, as he was Chairman of the Anti-Untouc- hability Board appointed by the Congress in 1929 and he had specia- lized on the question of temple-entry, having himself been instrumen- tal in opening to the Harijans his own family temple and in having a number of other temples opened in many parts of India.
 His special medical adviser Dr. Modi has advised distraction from brooding over his illness. For him to be interested in the untou- chability problem would be itself like a tonic. Indeed he was tempted to discuss the problem today, but it was impossible for me to do within the limited time allowed for the interview.
 Alike therefore for the sake of his health and of the work for which the Government of India have given me facilities, I request per- mission to have frequent interviews with Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj subject to the restrictions as aforesaid.
 I remain, Yours faithfully,

 We must differ as to the interpretation of the Gita. You cannot keep your cake and eat it at the same time.

If you will reduce yourself to nothing you have to do voluntarily and joyously the kind of service that the Bhangis do and at the same time give the poor and the afflicted the benefit of your medical knowledge free of charge. Do not call this impractical because many have been able to do it successfully.

  	Your letter. What can I write to you? I am tired of writing to you 	over and over again. My letters do not reach you at all; hence how 	long can I go on writing? Why should you take it to heart if you do 	not get the letters I write from this end? Why can’t you be 	confident in the belief that I can never forget you or keep you 	without a letter? You regularly received letters from me when you 	were outside, there is no reason to suppose that I no longer write 	to you.

 DEAR COL. DOYLE,"
134,"November 30, 1932",LETTER TO E. E. DOYLE,"
    
 November 30, 1932
  	I  thank  you  for  your  prompt  reply  to  my  letterlibtech_168_footnoteregarding Appasaheb Patwardhan, but I am sorry for 	the attitude you have taken up. Since the matter has gone up to the 	Government, I would like to draw their attention to the following 	facts:   Appasaheb 		Patwardhan is wedded 		to the 		idea that he 		should work side by 		side with Bhangis 		and it 		is most repugnant 		to him 		to have 		to observe in prisons 		untouchability which 		he does not do outside. He 		had to 		fast in 		1930 for 		this very reason.  I 		must adhere 		to my statement 		that Appasaheb 		Patwardhan had 		been actually doing 		Bhangi work in the 		Ratnagiri Jail, until 		he was 		stopped.  There 		was no 		question of 		his issuing 		any threat 		and, in 		my humble 		opinion, statement of 		his moral 		claim and consequence 		of rejection of that claim should not be considered as a threat.  In 		considering a 		moral or 		religious 		question, the 		question of 		shortage of 		labour does not arise.  In 		my opinion it 		is unjust to 		say of 		an absolutely docile 		priso- ner like 		Appasaheb Patwardhan 		who has been always 		prepared to do 		any task asked of 		him that he 		is fighting for“a 		particular variety 		of work”. 		He wants 		to do Bhangi 		work in 		addition to 		whatever task 		may be 		given to him.  There 		are many 		prisoners in Yeravda, 		including us 		three, who 		are anxious 		to do their 		own conservancy 		work, and 		it is because 		you have not 		looked upon it 		with favour that I 		have myself remained 		silent and 		with difficulty 		prevented my co-workers 		from making 		it an issue of conscience.  As 		you are yourself 		aware of 		the conversation 		about this 		matter and 		about hand-spinning 		by civil 		disobedience prisoners 		has remained 		in abeyance 		because of the 		more important matters 		arising, and absorbing 		my time 		and attention. 		But these 		two are matters 		of deepest 		importance to many 		of us. With 		due deference I 		cannot help 		repeating that 		to prevent     
 Appasaheb Patwardhan from voluntarily working side by side with his Bhangi co-prisoners because he does not belong to the Bhangi caste is a perpetuation in prisons of the bar of untouchability when that bar is being swiftly removed outside prison walls.
 I would therefore implore you personally to revise the uncom- promising attitude you have taken up and to let humble Appasaheb Patwardhan and his associates do conservancy work. Believe me that there is no defiance in their request. Some of us who are convinced civil resisters leave our resistance outside prison walls and having entered them are anxious to carry out and promote prison discipline to the utmost extent that our conscience would allow and we do so in order to show that our resistance is always civil and never incivil or criminal.
 But if I cannot make you or Government appreciate this obvious and just position, I have with the utmost regret to inform you that from Saturday the 3rd proximo, so far as I am concerned, I must join Appasaheb in his protest and respectfully claim to do my own conservancy work, and if he does not get the relief, I must put myself not on reduced rations but on a complete fast. I would ask you not to treat this as a threat, but as a human being to appreciate the feelings of a fellow-being. I have already hardened my heart, but I have not hard- ened it so as to see an honourable colleague wasting away in defence of a cherished principle without my at least sharing his agony and sac- rifice. Believe me it is no pleasure to me to have to write such letters.
 Yours sincerely,

135,"November 	30, 1932",LETTER TO F. MARY BARR,"
         MY 	DEAR MARY,       November 	30, 1932 
  	You have asked for only a postcard, but that won’t be adequate for 	me. Because I do not find a particular thing helpful for me, I may 	not be indifferent about others and not take the trouble of knowing 	whether it is helpful for them. I know that that particular form of 	idolatry is helpful for millions, not because they are lessdeveloped 	than I am, but because they are differently constituted. What must 	not be forgotten about me is that not only do I not consider 	idol-worship 
 to be a sin, but I know that in some form or other it is a condition of our being. The difference between one form of worship and another is a difference in degree and not in kind. Mosque-going or chruch- going is a form of idol-worship. Veneration of the Bible, the Koran, the Gita and the like is idol-worship and even if you don’t use a book or a building but draw a picture of divinity in your imagi-nation and attribute certain qualities, it is again idol-worship and I refuse to call the worship of the one who has a stone image a grosser form of worship. Learned judges have been known to have such images in their own homes. A philosopher like Pandit Malaviya will not eat his meal without offering worship to the household deity. It would be both arrogant and ignorant to look down upon such worship as superstition. Again in the imagination of the worshipper, God is in a consecrated stone and not in the other stones lying about him. Even so, the sanctuary in a Church is more sacred than any other place in it. You can multiply for yourself instances of this character. All this is a plea not for laxity in thought or worship, but it is a plea for a definite recognition of the fact that all forms of honest worship are equally good and equally efficient for the respective worshippers. Time is gone for the exclusive possession of right by an individual or a group. God is no respector of forms or words, for He is able to penetrate our actions and our speech and read and understand our thoughts, even when we do not understand them ourselves and it is first our thoughts that matter to him.
 I am glad you are with Maria and your picture of her family which includes our four-footed kinsfolk is instructive and it is just like her. I do not mind her not writing to me. Whilst I welcome her letters when she has anything to say to me, I do not want her to steal a single minute merely for writing to me because somebody else is writing.
 I am glad you have fourteen months’ grace. I like your progra- mme. So far as I recall you have not been to Santiniketan. You ought to go there at least. I do not want to harness you for untouchability work before you have gone through your touring. Untouchability work is a long programme and you can be fitted in whenever you are quite ready and you have a definite call from within. I would like you also quietly to study this movement in all its ramifications and assimi- late the spirit lying behind it, and if you give yourself to it I want you to do it with your whole heart without any mental reservation. I want you therefore not to hesitate to place all your doubts before me and offer yourself for the service when both your head and heart are
 completely satisfied. Of course in connection with the untouchability work you can see me any time you like.
 Please share this with Maria. My love to both of you in which Mahadev joins.

         November 	30, 1932  DEAR FRIEND,  	I thank you for your letter. Your suggestion puts the movement in a 	different frame from what I conceived. Untouchability is an evil of 	caste Hindus’ creation. They have, therefore, to remove the evil 	and everything else will follow from it. The purification of 	Harijans—if ‘purification’ is the word that can be used in 	this connection—will follow removal of untouchability. It must not 	be a condition prece- dent for removal. But whilst I would not like 	to identify myself with a movement such as you suggest, you are free 	to take it up and it will be  a step in advance, if Harijans are 	admitted after going through the ceremonies prescribed by you.

CHI. NARANDAS,
 
 I hope you read the slips to Radha and Kusum which I sent in today’s mail. Call both of them and ask them everything, and then literally follow the advice of the doctor whom you have consulted. Both you and I can then stop worrying. We are not masters of life or death, nor are doctors, but we can try. We may try as our reason guides us and then be unconcerned.
 It is nothing but God’s kindness that . . .libtech_172_footnoteleft. You had actually sanctioned him leave, and it was pure chance that youdetained him afterwards for some days. It was as though God had willed that he should be tested. Such things have often happened in the history of the Ashram. Evil got exposed of itself.
 I indeed wish to write at great length about food, but I don’t think I shall be able to do that. I shall have to be brief. It is not right to serve rotlas of bajri every day. If rotlas of bajri and jowar  and rotlis of wheat are served by turn, the inmates would get the benefit of all the three cereals. Every time the grain taken out for consumption should be weighed and the rotlas also should be of uniform weight. What the weight of each rotla should be, you will be able to decide only through experience. If you follow this practice, everyone will be able to know how much he should eat. Here the smallest rotla weighs six ounces. If people wish to derive the full benefit from the morning gruel, they should eat nothing else with it. The quantity of flour in the gruel should be measured. If the quantity of water also is measured, it will be easy to know how much flour each helping contained. If a person is not satisfied with one helping, he may by all means have another, but nobody should exceed the limit that he has fixed for himself. He may eat less sometimes if he has not enough appetite. But he should not exceed the fixed limit even if he feels more hungry than usual. This will do him no harm.
If the grain is properly cleaned before being ground, the flour
 
 of every  cereal  should  be  used   without   sifting.   I   approve   of Dr. Talwalkar’s suggestion for increasing the quantity of milk and ghee, but not at all of his suggestion for including chutney. Even those who eat chutney suffer from constipation. If you wish, you may make this experiment. You may prepare chutney for those who suffer from rather severe constipation. Let them try it. If the effect on them is undoubtedly beneficial, you may try it, if you wish, for others. In preparing the chutney, you should use black pepper  instead  of chillies. Read the letter which I shall write to Dr. Talwalkar about this. My own experience of chutney is not encouraging. Before I went to England, I may say that I used to eat pepper and chillies in fairly good quantities. At that time good food was my chief interest in life. In England, we get extract of chillies. I must have eaten it for about a month. I had to suffer for that. Afterwards, that is, in about a month or so, the pattern of my life changed and I left off eating spices, never to eat them again. Since then I have experimented on hundreds of persons, but I do not remember any case in which spices were used as  a medicine with beneficial effect. Personally I am convinced that constpation is a sign of indigestion. Food which is digested does not cause constipation. All food leaves some residue and, if it is properly digested, the bowels throw them out. However, I don’t press you to follow my advice. It is well-known that spices are inimical to physical celibacy. For that reason, too, we should think a hundred times before including spices in our food. We may certainly serve  any  spices purely as medicine for a limited period. It is possible that, so long as they act as medicine, they may not endanger celibacy. For instance, if  a person feels extremely cold, pure brandy will make him warm but will not intoxicate him, for the power of the brandy will have been used up in overcoming the cold. I think I have dwelt long enough on chutney. Dr.Talwalkar’s suggestion about including ground-nut should not be acted upon in any circumstances. I have experimented with ground-nut more than anybody else is likely to have done. It has been tried for a long time even in the Ashram. On the whole the result was discouraging. In the current experiment, you seem to have excluded dal altogether. It is all right if the effect has been good. For checking the effect, you should get everybody weighed, and should know from each person how he or she feels. It is for you to judge
 whether you can cope with all this work. If you do not get the fullest co-operation of most of the inmates for this experiment, you would do better to abandon it. If all of them co-operate, probably you will not feel it as a burden.
I should be happy if you can solve the problem of Ramji.
 About other things, I will write in the weekly letter on Monday. Every inmate of the Ashram should understand one thing, namely, that he should eat or munch nothing between the three meals which are served. If anybody does so, even cuts a green tamarind or plucks any bhaji from the beds to eat, he will have violated the vow of non- stealing and jeopardized the success of the experiment.
 
December 1, 1932
 Give Dr. Talwalkar’s letter to him after reading it and only if you approve of it.
 I send with this a cutting about the primus stove. Ask everybody to read it. Isn’t Keshu keeping good health?

May the increase in yours be infinite!
 For your health, I have shared with you the new knowledge I have gained. You will now find out what is good for you. Add to your food some salad, lettuce, ripe tomatoes or tender leaves of some bhaji. It is undoubtedly good for the bowels. But you should know best what is good for you.

 Your time-table reads crowded. You should have more relaxa- tion than you have given yourself. I do not think you should be rigid with yourself. There should be a feeling not of perpetual fatigue but of freshness. Are you giving yourself ample sleep? There should be no brooding.
 For me, I have to report an extraordinary result. From 103 I have jumped to 106 lb. Dried milk continues. But there is not a corre- sponding increase in energy or a decrease in the pain in the elbows. Even the absence of spinning has yet made no difference.

 There can be only one explanation for Bhau getting fever, namely, that he must have started eating cereals too early. If my guess is correct, he should very strictly refrain from cereals for about a month. That is, he should only drink milk and eat fruit and vege- tables. Among vegetables, he should eat only greens and not roots and tubers. He should start eating cereals only when he passes stool with- out difficulty. A person who knows how to resume eating grad-ually after a seven-day fast will never get fever.
 Madan’s book had been misplaced and I could not find it till today. I am now sending it by registered book-post. Bhau should read most of it carefully, but chiefly the explanation on pages 149 and 173 of the method of ending a fast. It is an extremely easy book to read and he will be able to finish it in a short time. I am sure you also will read it. The person who has sent the book about Zanzibar has written something with pencil on the inside of the cover. It is worth reading to understand his faith and love.
 I hope Kusum and Radha are all right now. I hope I shall get news about Puratan Buch in your next letter. How did Jamna get an attack of asthma so suddenly?

 I have not written to you recently because you are receving all the news as Satisbabu is here. I continue to receive news of you. I have explained to Satisbabu regarding those localities. Your worklibtech_196_footnoteis very much to my liking.
 You have raised a pertinent question about the Ashram and the answer is a simple one. If we wish to run the Ashram only through disciplined men and women, we must admit only those who are willing to exercise self-control. They will come with full under-standing of the rules and willingness to abide by them. We cannot impose our rules on those who come simply for earning a living. Their status is only that of employees. But we must not treat them as employees. We must regard them as our companions and keep them as long as they perform their duties conscientiously. The problem is that even those who come with the intention of observing regulations turn slack. Discrimination is essential on such occasions. In the name of God and by His Grace we must do all, we can.
 Do you follow all this? If not, ask me again. No time to write more.

 Have you ceased to be my poetess daughter now? Is it only a Rabindranath who can both be a poet and write copper-plate, or will Raihana also follow his example now? May God give you peace of mind.

They told Mr. Gandhi that the 	movement for temple-entry was making slow progress in Ahmedabad; 	only two temples having been so far thrown open to them. Mr. Gandhi 	admitted that he knew about it, and advised them to see what the 	local Anti-Untouchability League could do in the matter. Mr. Gandhi 	added that his efforts were, however, directed to that end, as he 	regarded temple-entry as essential for the removal of 	untouchability.  The 	interviewers agreed with the view, already expressed by Mr. Gandhi, 	that untouchability should be abolished by law. They also expressed 	satisfaction at their      
 having secured Mr. Birla as the President of the Anti-Untouchability League, through the influence of Mr. Gandhi.
 In conclusion, the interviewers requested Mr. Gandhi to contribute articles on the uplift of the Depressed Classes in the vernacular magazine Vijay which they had recently started. Mr. Gandhi said that he was getting a copy of that magazine, and promised to contribute articles to it.
 One of the interviewers drew a sketch of Mr. Gandhi while the interview was going on, and asked Mr. Gandhi to sign it. Mr. Gandhi refused to do so, saying that it was against the rules of the jail.

153,"December 	3, 1932",LETTER TO E. E. DOYLE,"
         DEAR 	COL. DOYLE,         December 	3, 1932 
  	At about 7.15 this morning Major Mehta handed me the following 	message:  Mr. 	Gandhi may be allowed to do his own conservancy work if he wants to. 	But he should be informed that Government cannot accept his 	intervention on behalf of convict Appasaheb Patwardhan. It 	seems to me that Government have not appreciated the posi-  	tion. The permission to me to do my own conservancy work is of 	little moment. Relief for Appasaheb Patwardhan is the chief and 	central thing. My fast began this morning as per my letterlibtech_203_footnotelibtech_204_footnoteto 	 you  and,   I am sorry to say, has to continue till relief is 	granted to Appasaheb Patwardhan and his associates. It should be 	understood that they have      
 asked not for doing their own conservancy work, but for joining the regular file and this they have done as a matter of sacred principle. Government should also know that it is not Bhangis alone who are given this work but others described as low castes are compelled to render this service although they have never done it outside prisons. Reformers like Appasaheb Patwardhan who were civil disobedience prisoners in 1930 in Ratnagiri could not suffer the misery of non-Bhangi prisoners being forced against their will to do the work and submitted to the authorities that they should be allowed to replace such men. This was, in my opinion, a laudable offer which the autho- rities should have gladly, if not thankfully, accepted. It was a volun- tary offer made to help the Government. Meanwhile the Delhi Pactlibtech_205_footnotecame. The same offer was renewed this time and these prisoners were permitted to do the work. Suddenly orders seem to have been sent to prohibit the work. Hence Appasaheb Patwardhan’s putting himself on reduced diet. I ventured to seek relief as soon as I came to know of this tragedy.
 In rejecting my humble and helpful intervention, Government seem to have suddenly reversed the policy which they adopted as early as 1922-23 in connection with me and have continued ever since. When during my first incarceration in 1922—and that as a convict—I sought to intervene on behalf of two hunger-striking priso- ners, it was at first resented and then on reconsideration the Govern- ment  accepted  it.libtech_206_footnoteThe  then  Inspector-General  of  Police  who   was deputed by His Excellency, Sir George Lloyd, to carry on negotia- tions with me and the Superintendent of this Prison thanked me for the happy result of the intervention. Two precious lives were saved and a beneficial circular was issued by the Government as a result of my humble effort. In 1930 under similar circumstances the new Superintendent, who knew little or nothing of the event just described of 1922-23 disliked my offer, but subsequently it was accepted by you yourself again with happy result and the practice was then estab- lished of my being allowed to see fellow-prisoners for the definite purpose of my being able to render the humble office of intermediary between them and the administration. That practice has been con- tinued up to now, not I hope with any unhappy result. Each time I have intervened, I hope the officials concerned will testify, I have done
 
 so in a helpful manner. It is, therefore, difficult for me to understand the Government without any apparent cause reversing this policy, and that too just when I have been obliged most reluctantly to embark upon a fast. I must regretfully adhere to the fast until relief is given to my friends and the human right of intervention that the Government have hitherto recognized is restored to me.
 There is one thing I should mention. I am carrying on concen- trated conversations about untouchability from day to day with many friends who come to see me. Just at present the strain is greater than usual because of the members of the Anti-Untouchability League being in Poona. The visitors are bound to notice the weakness that must overtake me even today and they are bound to inquire about the reason. I shall be unable to conceal the truth from them and yet I have no desire whatsoever that they should know anything about the unfor- tunate contretemps between Government and myself. For I am hoping that the Government will recognize the utter reasonableness of my request.
 Yours sincerely,

 You say Harijans should be allowed to enter temples, because all have broken the Shastras. This is an immoral attitude. If in 99 cases we have broken the Shastras that is no reason for breaking them in the 100th case. That is no reform but deform. My point is that not to allow Harijans to enter temples is wrong and against religion. This is a religious movement for elevation of religion.

 Whatever one has learnt about dharma is tested only at a time like this. If what we have read and thought does not help us in any way, we should take it that we have learnt nothing. If a doctor or a lawyer is well read in his subject and discourses learnedly on it but cannot handle even one case, he is a doctor or a lawyer only in name. Similarly, a man may be a great authority on religion but if his know- ledge of dharma is confined to what he has read in books or remains only in his mind, he is a dharma pundit only in name.

 [December 3, 1932]libtech_210_footnote
 I have never said that I will not concentrate all my energy on that service [emancipation of the Harijans], but I cannot previously bind myself not to do anything else. Circumstances may compel me to do things, which it would be sinful on my part not to do.
 Replying to a question as to why he should not carry on the Anti- Untoucha- bility propaganda from outside as he is doing it from the prison now, he said:
I am doing nothing but concentrating the whole of my energy
on the Harijans now.
 Q. As you attach a great importance to fast, would you advise others to carry on the campaign by the same methods?
A.  Fasting is a  very special method and nobody can fast unless
 there is a definite special call for him to do so. Therefore there should be no fast in imitation, and I would be so presumtuous as to say that if anybody wants to fast in connection with untouchability out of sym- pathy he or she should refer to me and obtain my consent before so doing. But I can say that on that single issue of Guruvayur, none but Kelappan and I should fast. But everybody can and should carry on
 
 the campaign in hundreds of other ways which are open to all because the methods of service are so many and varied.
 Q. Having dedicated yourself to the Harijans, does not your life belong to them
  now?   A. 	To say that my life belongs to Harijans is only half truth. The "
159,"December 4, 1932",STATEMENT ON FAST TO ANTI-UNTOUCHABILITY COMMITTEElibtech_213_footnote,"
  	whole truth is that my life belongs to God and therefore it belongs 	to the Harijans and, for that matter, the whole of creation, and it 	is God who can keep me, or can take me away.  Questioned 	if, when fighting the untouchability battle, he should fritter away 	his energy on other issues by fasting, Mahatmaji said: This 	was also along the same lines. There was therefore no ques- tion 	of frittering away any energy.  It 	will be a year now, since the campaign was launched.libtech_211_footnoteWhat should be our 	next step? Would you give any message for the New Year? A. 	That question is outside the scope of permission granted to  me.libtech_212_footnote  The 	Hindustan Times, 7-12-1932         December 4, 1932 Although 	the Inspector-General gave me permission to say whatever I liked 	about the origin of the fast and what passed between Government 	and myself I do not want to take full advantage of the  	liberty he has given me. I shall only give you the substance of what 	happened so that you can be at ease and my position may not be mis- 	understood. The fast which commenced yesterday, was, you will be 	glad to know, broken just before I came here. Mine is a peculiar 	posi- tion. Though I have hardened my heart there are things about 	which I have an exceedingly sensitive nature. To me there is no 	difference of degree in matters of moment and as I am capable of 	giving my life for a great cause I am equally capable of laying down 	my life for the life of a comrade.      
 Now in the present case, the question before me was one of choice either to allow a dear comrade to die and myself live uncon- cerned or in an attempt to save his life put mine in jeopardy. Appa- saheb Patwardhan, who is a prisoner in Ratnagiri Jail is an incorrup- tible man and a dear comrade whom I know to be cent per cent honest. I came to know through regular channels that Appasaheb had to put himself on the lowest diet consistent with bare existence for the service of untouchables which he wanted to do and which he was not permitted to do. I wrote to Governmentlibtech_214_footnotelibtech_215_footnotein mildest language possible that if relief was not given to Appasaheb, I would have to go through the same agony and sacrifice as he was undergoing. He was and is going through slow death. I said I should have to fast. If I de-serted him I would be capable of deserting the Harijans, and a man who deserts his comrades is not worth much. I had necessarily to give short notice because there was no choice for me.
 Although I know that Appasaheb is a man of iron nerves, I could imagine what agonies a man on reduced rations would be going through and so I could not help giving short notice. I am glad to say that circumstances have arisen enabling me to break my fast though it does not mean that the chapter is closed. The Inspector-General of Prisons who was here is conferring with Government and pending Government’s decision, which he hopes to get from Government on or before Wednesday morning, the fast stands suspended. But I have hopes I will not have to resume it. So far as my physical well-being is concerned I may say that I could not be better looked after than here and no one should run away with the idea that Government are not at all concerned about my life or they would like me to die in jail. They honestly want to see me discharged, if I am to be discharged at all, in full possession of health, that is to say, consistently with my age. In the present case I had asked for very little but perhaps Government thought it was too much; but I think they will now understand the delicate position and grant the relief which is sought for.libtech_216_footnotelibtech_217_footnoteThere are other matters also regarding the fast, but I do not like to go into them. It will certainly be very good if the Government publishes the corres- pondence I had with it. But I leave it to the Government.
 I hope what I told you is enough to give an assurance that I have not acted stupidly or hurriedly or unwisely. Knowing me as you do,
 
 you would wish me to act in the same manner should a similar occa- sion arise again. So far as I am concerned I should lose all my self- esteem and consider myself a despicable creature if I did not do all I was capable of doing in the contingency. For a man like me, who may not commit violence and who has taken a vow to observe non- violence in thought, word and deed, has self-sacrifice as a last resort. I depend on wisdom given by God to a small man like me and the weapon that I possess is readiness to fling away my life when there is a desperate cause. In this way my life is based on many such fasts. This is the highest form of prayer. The world has known it recently but I knew it for many years. It is not a thoughtless action. In it there is no coercion on others. It does bring pressure on individuals and the Government but is no more than the natural and moral outcome of self-sacrifice. It shakes and awakes the slumbering soul and impels a loving heart to action. The person, who has to introduce basic reforms in man, social conditions and atmosphere, has to create fermentation in the public. It cannot be brought about without causing a shake up in the society. There are only two ways of doing this—violence and non-violence. Violence affects the body and degrades both the person who commits it and the person who is the object of it. But in fasting the person suffers himself and the pressure brought about is of quite different kind. It does not affect the body of the person at whom it is directed but strengthens his morale or nature. I hope what I have told you is enough. Who knows I may have to go through a series of fasts and die by inches. But if that does happen I want you to feel proud of my action and not feel that it was the action of an imbecile. My life is largely governed by reason and, when it fails, it is governed by a superior force, that is, faith.

 December 4, 1932
 I 	am writing this after having taken my silence.  	It is better to put down in writing what I have understood to be the 	position.  	The fast remains suspended till Wednesday morning so as to give the 	Government time to come to a final decision.  	The fast is not to be resumed if the Government give permission to 	Appasaheb Patwardhan and his associates to do conservancy work in 	common with the regular file, it being considered sufficient even if 	permission is restricted to such service in the yard they occupy.  	The larger question of such permission being given to volun- teers 	to be settled as soon as possible.  	By the breaking of the fast today I do not give up the human right 	of intervention on behalf of fellow-prisoners. The Government have 	called my assistance intervention. I do not regard it as such. All 	my  previous  interventionslibtech_219_footnotehave  been  helpful  as  I  believe   Majors Jones, 	Martin, Bhandari and perhaps you could testify.

If you have 	not given up Dr. Talwalkar completely, request him to see Dr. 	Harilal.  	Write to Mahavir and inform him that I have asked you not to send 	any more money to him.  Morning, Monday [December 5, 1932] My fast was short 	and soon over. In one-and-a-half days, I became fairly weak. I think 	I also overworked. But probably I shall    
 recover strength very soon. Nobody should worry. My fasts are a daily affair now, and should cause no worry.

 I have your two letters. Both deal with the same thing. My fastlibtech_227_footnoteof short duration should not worry you. I will be up in a few days.
 I have an idea of the situation there. We can help only those who spin of their own volition and spin well. Can’t you get children or adults who are prepared to take up spinning as yajna? Did you try in the schools there? If you are not able to persuade anyone, but can look after the Harijan children, even that would do, or, if you want to set up an ashram, do so. Confer with Narandas. Only if the place gives you peace, will I prefer it. I will be satisfied if you are clear in your mind about what you are doing. Whatever you do, do it openly and it would satisfy me, Is not the place useful as a sanatorium? Can’t you get even dry fruit there? What about vegetables?
 Do whatever you feel is best for Kashi. Prabhudas keeps writingto me. He wants to fly high but is unable to do so. That is the only problem in the way of his recovering his health.

Ramji is a different problem. Our atonement lies in winning him 	over.

We should not do so through selfish motives or under pressure from 	somebody. If we do so because we want to take work from them, our 	motive is selfish.

If, however, you do not find it possible at all to work in co- 	operation with him, do not give him any more work. Do nothing un- 	willingly or if it makes you unhappy.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got your two letters, of the 3rd and the 4th, together. I under- stand from what you say in your letter that Kusum will follow Dr. Talwalkar’s advice, but Radha will not. She will derive any benefit from the treatment that she is likely to get only if she carries it out with determination. Qureshi’s decision to go to Lucknow is correct. You did right in not sending Hasmukhrai’s letter. See if you can still reason with Parvati and restrain her.
 I would not have the courage to undertake the experiment which you are making with regard to Ratilal. This does not mean that you should not continue it. But it can certainly mean that you have more love in you than I, and it should not be surprising if that is so. The real test of a teacher lies in his success in training his pupil to do better than himself. In other words, he should give to the pupil all he has. If, however, he had had to struggle hard to acquire what he has, his knowledge and skill would be limited. On the other hand, if the pupil whom he is training has great natural aptitude, he can considerably increase what he receives from the teacher. I have not, therefore, paid you an idle compliment in saying what I have written above. It is nothing but an expression of my sincere wish, and that has always been my nature. Whenever I try to impart to somebody what I possess, my only wish is that the other person should improve upon what I give him. In small matters this has actually happened.
 Prema seems to be deceiving herself. She overworks and falls ill. She had said in her last letter that the pain in the back had completely disappeared and that she was confident that it would not come back. Take the necessary measures immediately. If it is absolutely necessary to get her tonsils removed, do so as soon as possible.
 Chhaganlal is at Hyderabad. I expect him to return here in two or three days.
 I have not received Flowers of St. Francis. You need not, however, send it if it is with you. I have been able to get another copy.

184,"December 5, 1932",INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS,"
    
 December 5, 1932
My future is in the hands of God.
 
 Gandhiji was resting on a cot when I was conducted to the ward. A lady visitor, who had entered the jail premises ten minutes before, was sitting near Gandhiji, carry- ing on a one-sided conversation, as Gandhiji’s day of silence had not yet ended. Mr. Mahadev Desai, the Mahatma’s Secretary, was busy attending to the correspondence. Punctually at 2 p.m., the Mahatma broke his silence.
 The Mahatma, referring to the referendum that is being taken in Guruvayur, stated that he was glad, it was being done in a thorough manner. Instructions were
 
 printed on the back of the voting-paper, and to each house-holder the issue was to be clearly explained.libtech_235_footnote
 Referring to the legal difficultieslibtech_236_footnote, Gandhiji said that it was not his province to study those difficulties. He was prepared to be guided by the legal friends. The Mahatma stressed that every difficulty ought to be overcome. He was satisfied with Dr. Subbaroyan’s Billlibtech_237_footnotelibtech_238_footnotepublished in The Hindu. Asked whether he would postpone his
 fast now, in view of the efforts being made in that direction, Gandhiji said that if the referendum was in his favour, and legal difficulties had to be overcome before 2nd January, so far as he could see the fast must be suspended. But if Dr. Subbaroyan was not granted leave to introduce the Bill, the fast would commence on 2nd January.
 Commenting on the suggestion made in the Press that the surest way of preventing him from commencing the fast in connection with Guruvayur was to vote against temple-entry, the Mahatma said:
I cannot get out of the fast by such a dodge. I shall then
 have to impose upon myself a far more severe ordeal than a fast unto death.
 One of those sitting round him, and listening to the answers he was giving me, remarked that there could be nothing more severe than a fast unto death. Gandhiji retorted:
No. Hitherto I have made my fast conditional. A more severe
 resolve would be a thirty days’ fast. If I go on a thirty days’ fast, I am bound to carry it out, irrespective of whether the temple is thrown open to Harijans or not.
 Questioned regarding the suggestion of some pundits in South India for a com- promise between sanatanists and reformers, that if Harijans underwent a purification ceremony they could be admitted into temples, Gandhiji said:
I am not in favour of such a proposal. It is the caste Hindus who
 have to undergo purification for having done a violent wrong to the untouchables.
 The Mahatma would not agree to put a black mark on the Harijan and to say,
 
 for instance, that unless he put on a turban he would not be allowed into the temple. All Hindus going to temples were expected to give up carrion-eating.
 Dr. Ambedkar had brought to Gandhiji’s notice an incident that took place in the neighbourhood of Poona. There Harijans decided on giving up eating carrion. They were prepared to forgo the gain they were getting from the job of removing dead animals. Caste Hindus did not like the Harijans’ decision not to remove dead animals. They forced Harijans to eat carrion, saying that it was their dharma. Caste Hindus were the real instigators, and just as in law the instigators were not exempted from punishment, caste Hindus should be taken to task. It was they who had to undergo purification.
 Asked whether asking for the allotment of a particular kind of work in jail by the prisoners amounted to a breach of the jail discipline, Gandhiji said:
It is not open to any civil disobedience prisoner to ask for any
 particular work in the place of some other work. All jail discipline will be broken if it was for the prisoners to demand so.
 Mr. Patwardhan had not demanded, the Mahatma continued, a particular work in the place of some other work. What he had said was that he should not be debarred from doing scavenging or conservancy work. He would do the task allotted to him, and also do conservancy. He wanted to be placed in the same category as the so-called low-caste men. It was not merely Bhangis that did this work. All low-caste men were doing it. Every jail did not contain Bhangis. The jail authorities were confining this unclean work to low class people. If they did not do so, there would be a violent agitation by caste Hindus that the Government were breaking their religion and asking them to do low-caste work. Government did not want such an agitation. It had been the rule to exempt high-caste Hindus from doing scavenging work. Mr. Patwardhan could not possibly take advantage of the exemption and so pleaded that he should be allowed to do this work. His case was under consideration by the Government. Gandhiji said that making such a request to the Government did not amount to violation of any jail rule. It did not amount to disobedience of jail regulations.
 Gandhiji declared that the future was in the hands of God, and not in the hands of the Government. In respect of last Saturday’s fast, there was a divine call, and he had responded to it.
 It was true, the Mahatma continued, that he was now devoting all his twenty-four hours to untouchability work. Even while sleeping, he was thinking of it.
 
 Asked whether he would devote so much of his time to this question even when out of jail, Gandhiji with a twinkle in his eyes replied:
I shall not certainly neglect it.
 
 The jail doctor arrived at this stage and examined the Mahatma. The doctor declared that Gandhiji was having a ‘tennis-elbow’. One of the visitors said, “Gandhi has never played tennis.” On this, Mahatmaji humorously remarked:
Yes, it is true. I call this ‘takli-elbow’.
 Mr. Thakkar reminded Gandhiji that it was nearing 3 p.m. and Press corres- pondents were taking up all the time. Mahatmaji cracked a joke with him saying:
Mr. Thakkar should obey his President.
 
 Mr. Birla (the President of the Anti-Untouchability League) declared that he had no grievance against the Pressmen.
 Gandhiji expressed his satisfaction at the progress of the work going on in the country for removal of untouchability.
 Gandhiji declared that he would not accept conditional release. Questioned whether he would accept ‘parole’ for fifteen days, to go to Guruvayur, the Mahatma remarked:
Parole is conditional release.

 Door-to-door collections of funds for the work of the Anti-Un- touchability League should be made everywhere.
 A few caste Hindus can set an example to others by cleaning the quarters of Harijans and being of service to them in similar and other ways.
 Games, sports and parties should be held by mixed gatherings of Harijans and caste-Hindu children.
 Processions and kirtan parties of Harijans and caste Hindus should be organized and general efforts should be made to bring the
 
 two together, especially in the quarters of the latter.
 Public meetings should be held everywhere at which evils of all forms and grades of untouchability should be clearly explained and prayers offered for their speedy and total eradication.
 Also, resolutions should be adopted at these meetings for carry- ing on unremitting propaganda for the purpose of special resolutions in favour of entry of Harijans into all Hindu temples, especially Guruvayur.

188,"December 6, 1932",LETTER TO RAMDAS GANDHI,"
    
 December 6, 1932 Are  you  able to  follow  the “Ram Gita”libtech_243_footnote?  Its  central idea  is bhakti and its fruit. Pure bhakti is bound to lead to non-attachment
and true knowledge. If bhakti does not produce such results, it is not
 true bhakti but mere sentimentality. True knowledge means the dis- crimination between the essential and the non-essential. The book- learning that does not give this power of discrimination is not know- ledge but bookishness. You can see that once this is realized and the “Ram Gita” grasped accordingly, all worry and impatience dis- appear.
 I am writing this letter soon after the morning prayers. I inten- ded to write about the fast, but began with comments on the “Ram Gita”. The fast is now a thing of the past. As it lasted only a day and a half, I feel no effect of it at all. The weakness came rather quickly but it also left as quickly as it had come. I did a lot of work on the day of the fast and also on Sunday. I can now take sufficient quantity of milk. You should not, therefore, worry about my fasts any time. You should know one thing, i.e., that it is not I who undertake a fast. It may be said that God does it, as my fasts are inspired by Him. You should not, therefore, feel unhappy when I fast, but,  if  anything, rejoice that I follow dharma by doing so. It should  also  be remembered that no one is to fast in mere imitation of my action. And particularly those who have close relations with me should fast only after consulting me. Of course it is possible to imagine circumstances in which there might be no time at all to consult me or when the inspi- ration from within might be unmistakable. However, the tradition
 
 “Letter to Ramdas Gandhi”, 7-11-1932.
 among spiritual seekers has been that one should take a new step only after consulting the person one has accepted as more experienced than oneself as long as such a person is physically with us. Everybody cannot hear the inner voice as a matter of course. What one hears may be only a semblance of the inner voice or in fact the voice of the ego. The ego means Satan, Ravana, Ahriman or the Demon. We cannot always recognize whether it is the voice of Rama or Ravana. Very often, Ravana appears in the garb of a sadhu and he looks like Rama. We should, therefore, consult a person of more experience if such a one is available. I intended to write a short letter, but I have written a long one. Show this to all.

  From 	a photostat: G.N. 6702. Also C.W. 4448. Courtesy: U. Subba Rao         December 6, 1932 To ensure 	that my fast does not by any chance pass as black-  mail, the 	opinion of the people living in the neighbourhood of the temple 	is being collected. If the majority is in favour of the reform,  	the reform is a duty and should be effected. This in no way involves 	injustice to the minority. If the minority desires, a fixed time can 	be 
 set apart for them. Otherwise, it is open to them to build a temple of their own. If three of the four brothers living as a joint family change their religion, it will be justice if they become the owners of the joint family property and give the fourth brother his share. In the present case the utmost that the minority can demand is money to build a separate temple for themselves. However, they cannot do even that if an exclusive time is set apart for them when they can worship in the temple. If we apply this line of reasoning to your case, the conclusion is this: The Grandfather should have the freedom to follow dharma as he understands it, and you to follow it as you understand it. If, for this reason, he asks you to leave the home, you have no choice but to endure the boycott. If your wife refuses to live with you unless you undergo ceremonial purification, you should endure boycott by her too. You should not live with her against her will. A husband has no right whatever to force his wife to do or believe anything. But it is probable that the wife will say this: ‘What else can I do even if you do not undergo purification? I will live with you.’ If your wife says this, it means that she cares for you more than she does for the custom of untouchability. In other words, as between the custom of untoucha- bility and living with you, she regards it as her duty to live with you. We have to make innumerable such choices every day in our life, but we make them spontaneously and, therefore, are not conscious of doing so. This contains a reply to all your questions. Ask me to ex- plain again if you do not follow anything in this. If you wish to put other questions, you may do that too.

  	Dahyabhai’s temperature was expected to return completely to 	normal on Sunday, but it did not. It does become normal but again 	rises up to 99° to 100°. So the fever may perhaps persist a week 	longer. But the doctor has ceased to worry. He has started giving 	Dahyabhai Sanatogen as a tonic, besides a pound and a half of milk, 	which is well-digested. Ambalallibtech_249_footnote, Thakkarlibtech_250_footnote, 	Ba and others went and saw Dahyabhai during the last two days or so. 	All of them report that Dahyabhai is cheerful. No one would believe 	that he had been suffer- ing from typhoid for as long as four weeks. 	You should not, therefore, worry in the least.  	My fast is now an old story. I hope you read all about it in The 	Times of India. Such fasts are a frequent occurrence in my life. 	You should, therefore, regard them as normal and devote yourself to 	your daily work. I hope you are quite well.  Blessings 	from  BAPU [From 	Gujarati]  Bapuna 	Patro—4: Manibehn Patelne, 	pp. 95-6

  	It seems to me that if the letter addressed to the Zamorin and 	signed by all students who believe in the removal of untouchability 	be sent, it will be a striking thing showing the Hindu world that 	the rising generation is bent on removing the black mark and it 	would be a great thing if the example of the Hindu University was 	followed by the Hindu students throughout India.

         [Before December 7, 1932]libtech_254_footnote  Questioned 	whether he would be satisfied with the admission of Harijans up to 	the flag postlibtech_255_footnote, 	Mahatmaji made it perfectly clear that there was no halfway house in 	the house of God. There is no such thing as temple-entry step by 	step. It should be unconditional and unqualified. The Harijans 	should be given the same equality of status as the other caste 	Hindus in the matter of public worship.  Asked 	whether he 	would accept some 	elementary test 	like purification and 	giving up 	eating beef, etc., 	Mahatmaji said that though he 	was always 	advocating the 	purification and 	the social uplift of 	the Harijans in 	all respects, he 	has made it 	a point of honour 	not to 	accept any 	conditions whatsoever 	as conditions 	precedent for admission 	of Harijans 	into temples. Some of the 	caste Hindus who 	enjoy the 	right of 	free entry need as much 	purification, if not more.  The 	status of Harijans today is in direct proportion to the shameful 	treatment the caste Hindus have been giving them for generations 	past. In fact the conditions calling for purification are the result 	of such treatment. The position of the caste Hindus in this respect 	is exactly similar to that of a debtor in a commercial        
 transaction. A man who has contracted a loan is only doing his duty by paying back a portion of it and need not consider himself generous for paying back half of what he owes.
 Asked whether he would allow sympathetic fasting on the issue of the temple-entry, Mahatmaji emphatically asserted that Mr. Kelappan held the field on the issue of fasting on the Guruvayur temple-entry. If the fast came off he would strongly object to anybody else fasting in sympathy with them or offering satyagraha on that issue. This does not preclude legitimate country-wide propaganda in the cause of anti-untouchability movement and temple-entry.

 December 7, 1932
 
  	I have had a long chat with Sjt. Ghanshyamdas Birla, as also 	Satisbabu regarding the Anti-Untouchability Board for Bengal. I have 	also several letters from Bengal complaining about the formation of 	the Board. Before it was formed Ghanshyamdas had told me that he was 	going to ask you to form the Board, and without giving any thought 	to the suggestion I at once endorsed it. But I see that the idea has 	not found favour in Bengal, especially so far as Satisbabu and Dr. 	Suresh are concerned. They think that the Board is bound to have a 	party colour about it. I do not know how far this fear is justified, 	but I do know this that the work of anti-untouchability should not 	become a party affair in any way whatsoever. We want all who desire 	the reform to associate themselves freely and whole-heartedly with 	any organization that may be formed. I would therefore suggest that 	you should call all the workers representing different groups and 	parties and place yourself at their disposal and let them then 	choose whomsoever they like as President, offering to give your 	whole-hearted co- operation to the President and Board of their  	choice. I know that this requires self-abnegation. If I know you 	well, I know that this is not beyond you. Of course if you feel that 	there is nothing in the com-plaints made and that you will be able 	to smooth down all the diffi-culties and that you will be able to 	bring all the parties together, I have of course nothing to say. In 	making the suggestions that I have made I have assumed the 	impossibility of securing the association of all parties with the 	Board as it is constituted  at present. I have now placed the whole 	thing before you. You will do whatever is best in the interest of 	the cause.libtech_258_footnote  	Sjt. Khaitan gave me your message about Basanti Devi. I told him 	that I wanted her to make her own choice, but wanted her to work 	effectively and ceaselessly in the cause of anti-untouchability. I 	am not enamoured of her accepting any office in any organization. 	When I was there at the time of the Deshbandhu collections, both she 	and I had come to the conclusion that hers was not to run any 	organization,     also 	“Letter to Dr. B. C. Roy”, 15-12-1932.

204,"December 7, 1932",LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL GANDHI,"
    
 YERAVDA MANDIR,
 December 7, 1932
 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 Padma and his mother came and saw me yesterday. Devdas was with them, too. They had brought two long letters from Prabhudas. For the present, I have given them to Devdas to read so that I might know the impression they make on him. Those letters and my conver- sation with Padma have given me at any rate the definite impression that the two have become deeply infatuated with each other. They regard their relation to each other as that of a brother and sister or a father and daughter, but that is nothing but self-deception. However, I believe that they have not completely fallen. The two do not even know that they are sexually attracted to each other, but in fact they are. Padma is a silly girl and still a child, is very talkative and also affectionate. So probably she does not even know what it is to be sexually attracted. But her ways and manners and the expressions on her face are those of a wife to a husband. It is rather different with Prabhudas. He is full of sexual fancies but is fighting hard to over- come them. While he had not yet succeeded in that, he came across a girl like Padma. He is quite aware that he must entertain no sexual feelings towards her. But what can he do? That is why he keeps company with her. The two have met privately and moved about together. What is poor Sarojinidevi to do? She is very much upset and deeply hurt. Padma would not listen to her, would not wake up, and as for Prabhudas, she does not have the courage to speak to him. However, the atmosphere could not but become vitiated. The neigh- bours saw the impurity of their relation which the two could not see. Sitala Sahay came to know of it and was very unhappy. He has rushed to me with all of them to find a solution. Though Prabhudas has not physically fallen, he believes himself so far guilty that he has come to  a decision that the two of them should not be together any time and is asking my permission to undertake a fast of fifteen or twenty days’ duration so that he might learn to be vigilant. If he is not permitted to undertake a fast, he wants to be permitted to marry. All this is not quite clear in his letters, but I have been able to read it between the lines. I do not intend to permit him to undertake a fast, but wish to press him to get married. He believes that he would be able to find a suitable girl. I think he will have no difficulty in finding such a girl if
 he tries to look outside the circle of our caste. I have no difficulty in making up my mind to this extent, but what is to be done about Khali? Both Prabhudas and Padma need to stay at hill station. It would be proper for both to stay in Almora and at separate places but it would not be worthy of what we believe to be our poverty or what others think to be our poverty. Our poverty may seem outdated, but then we must put some limit somewhere. However, God will show us the way. I have written all this just for your information and not to ask for your help in this matter or to cause you worry. Prabhudas is no more a child. He wants me to show him the way. Since he likes my advice, I will go on guiding him and in that way things will be right in the end. Ultimately it will happen neither as I wish nor as Prabhudas wishes. After all there is a limit to what human effort can achieve. Prabhudas’s aspirations have always been noble. He is not deceitful and so, God will save him. He has struggled very hard to remain a life-long celibate, but the Fate seems to have been against him. How is Prabhudas to blame for that? He has come out safe from  many difficult circumstances earlier also and will do so this time, too. I will not think it a misfortune if he marries. He will rather be happy, and so neither you nor Kashi need grieve at all and make yourselves miserable. I am not going to blame Prabhudas even in my thought, neither personally nor in my letters. If anybody has been at fault in this, it was me, for I have induced all of you to join me in a  stupendous experiment as dangerous as putting one’s hand into a serpent’s burrow. I do not at all repent having done so. The experi- ment will certainly continue and its result is bound to be good. It will require sacrifices though, and we shall make them. You yourself were thinking of going to Khali. If you do wish to go and if you can hand over your Vijapur work to somebody, I see no harm in your going. Your presence at Khali will certainly be a source of consolation to Prabhudas, but your first duty is to take care of the work of Vijapur. How will Kashi manage? She also is almost a cripple. She just cannot tolerate the weather at Almora at this time of the year. This needs to be considered, too. If, after taking into consideration all this, you still wish to go and can go, you may do so. But do not think it at all necessary to go there for Pabhudas’s good. I cannot think of any- thing more to write after this.

206,,INTERVIEW TO ASSOCIATED PRESS OF INDIA,"
    
 POONA,
 December [7] libtech_268_footnote, 1932 The Government have regarded the question as of all-India im- portance. From the point of view of prison administration, they had
difficulty in giving a decision in connection with the request of Appa-
 saheb Patwardhan, but they have consented to consider the whole question and announce their decision as early as possible. In the cir- cumstances, I recognized the Government’s difficulty myself, and was permitted to send a telegramlibtech_269_footnoteto Appasaheb advising him,  pending Government decision, to suspend the partial fast. The following tele- gram was received from him this morning:
 Your kind wire. Agree postpone action. Letter follows. Health is quite all right.
The result is, Appasaheb begins to take his full rations from
 today, and my fast stands, naturally, further suspended. From my  point of view as an anti-untouchability worker, the matter is quite simple. The so-called high-caste Hindus, like Appasaheb Patwardhan and his co-workers, who voluntarily offer to do conservancy work, purely from a humanitarian motive and in a spirit of service, should be permitted to do that work. The existing practice seems to be to confine this service to the so-called low caste prisoners, although they may never have done conservancy work outside, and although they may not belong to the Bhangi caste, and this they are made to do whether they wish it or not.
 People who are in prison for conscience sake cannot afford to arrogate superiority to themselves. At the same time, there are obvious administrative difficulties in suddenly disturbing a practice that has prevailed for a number of years throughout the prisons in India. I have, therefore, no hesitation in suspending the fast myself, pending an examination of the whole question by the Government of India and the Local Government. Appasaheb has specialized in this subject and therefore knows much more about it than I do. I am glad he has appreciated the Government’s difficulties and has suspended the  partial fast. Let us hope that an early and satisfactory decision will be arrived at by the Government so as to enable the reformers now
 
 undergoing imprisonment to render conservancy service, without in any way impairing the smooth administration of the various goals.

The above was written last night. It is now 5 a.m. after prayer and 	the drink and the oranges. Of the loss of 6 lb. not in one day but 	in four days, I have regained 2 lb. This shows that I can gain a few 	pounds as quickly as I lose. In other words it is merely the weight 	of superficial food and water I carry about me. The fast lasted only 	44 hours. It can produce no permanent harm. You are right when you 	say that I could not have rebuilt the muscle lost during the last 	fast.  	But the fast has become the normal course of my life. It is the 	spiritual medicine applied from time to time for diseases that yield 	to that particular treatment. Not everyone can gain the capacity for 	it all of a sudden. I have gained it, if I have, after a very long 	course of training.  	Co-workers should not be unhinged or the least disturbed when- ever 	they hear about my fast. They should rejoice at it, if they believe 	in my purity and sanity. For then it must be good for us all and the 	whole world, even as every spiritual effort is. It must be for us 	all an encouragement to greater heart searching and purification. I 	am glad you have again some company of the ordinary kind.  	I do not want to start the saltless experiment just now. I am 	watching the elbows. There is no discomfort. Suspension of spinning 	is a deprivation. I should bear it for the time being.  	Manilal and his wife are off to South Africa next week. Their 	presence is necessary there. They must not be diverted from their 	duty by my fast and the like. They cannot alter the course of events 	andcan     
 render me no help. They should not have rushed here at all.
 Ba and Urmila Devi are doing well in the South. But I must stop now.

  	A pamphlet published by certain prisoners recently discharged from 	Ratnagiri Jail has just been received by me. I  enclose  the 	original. I have marked certain portions and I send you for 	immediate reference a free translation of some of the most important 	portions. From this two things stand out prominently. Quite a large 	number of the so-called high-caste Hindus were actually doing 	conservancy work with satisfaction, till the work was stopped under 	your orders. The party was organized and its work supervised by 	Appasaheb Patwar- dhan himself. At the time there were not 	sufficient Bhangis in the Jail, therefore the so-called low-caste 	prisoners had to be imported from another jail. If this information 	is correct, it makes Appasaheb’s case stronger than I had 	imagined. But that is not now of much moment. What however is clear 	to me is that this is a case which demands early and sympathetic 	handling.

 I understand what you say about the death anniversary of Swami Shraddhanandji. I did mention your proposal to some members of the new organization, but they thought, and I agree with them, that it would be wrong for the organization to observe the day under its aus- pices. There is already an organization brought into being by the marvellous activities of Shraddhanandji himself. Its scope is much larger than that of the Anti-Untouchability Society. There is every danger of its activity being misunderstood if it celebrated the anniver- sary under its auspices, and it would be wrong if it limited the scope of the observance so as to keep it in a line with its objective.

  	With reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, here are my 	answers to your questionslibtech_282_footnote:     If, 				as a 				result of 				the referendum, 				it is found 				that the majority of the 				temple-going 				population in the 				area covered by 				the referendum 				is against 				temple-entry by 				Harijans, the 				fast will undoubtedly 				be post- 				poned. The 				postponement is 				likely to 				be indefinite, and 				resumption, if 				there is to be a 				resumption, can 				only be determined 				by circumstances 				over which I can have no control and which I cannot forsee.libtech_283_footnote  I 				think that it 				is premature to 				talk of 				satyagraha about 				other temples 				if and 				when Guruvayur is 				opened. We 				should always hope 				that the opening of Guruvayur will clear the way to the other temples.  I 				should hope 				that the Zamorin will 				not influence the 				people one way or 				the other, 				but even if 				he does, I 				should expect 				peopleat least 				on a 				religious question 				such as 				the one before 				them to 				think independently. 				In any 				event, I 				should consider 				myself bound by 				the opinion 				of the 				majority. The 				referendum will 				merely determine 				the question 				of the 				fast, not 				the question of 				opening the 				temple. If 				the result 				is hostile 				to temple-entry 				by Harijans, 				ways and means 				will have to 				be found of 				educating public 				opinion and preparing 				it for 				the opening. 				This is 				clear to 				me that there should 				be no forcible 				opening of any single temple. It would be an unseemly thing to have hostile             When 					Guruvayur Temple is 					opened, satyagraha 					will be 					offered at 					other temples. 					Will you render 					your active support?  As 					the Zamorin is 					a big landlord and 					influential man, will 					he not be able 					to carry 					a large 					section of the 					caste Hindus with 					him? Will it be a 					proper and 					genuine expression of the opinion of the caste Hindus that we obtain through the referendum?  Are 					you not aware that 					many caste Hindus eat 					beef ? In your fifth 					statement in 					reply to 					my question you 					asked Harijans to 					give up 					beef. Some people 					take it 					as a condition for 					entry into temples. 					In that 					case are all caste 					Hindus who eat 					beef eligible for 					temple-entry? You might be aware that there are several 					untouchables who 					neither eat 					beef nor 					lead unclean 					lives.

    I 			am firmly 			of opinion 			that there 			should be no 			condition made 			for the entry 			of Harijans 			to temples 			that are not 			applicable to 			the other 			Hindu worshippers. 			There should be 			therefore one 			regulation for 			all. I 			personally do 			feel that beef being 			forbidden food 			in Hindu- 			ism, it should 			be given up 			by beef-eating 			Harijans, whether  the 			 temples are 			opened or 			not. They should 			impose that condition 			on themselves 			without any prompting 			and without 			any consideration 			in the 			shape of 			temple-entry or 			other. There can 			be no doubt 			that every reform 			voluntarily made 			by Harijans 			among themselves 			is bound 			to hasten the 			removal of 			the black 			mark. It would make 			the task of 			caste-Hindu reformers 			infinitely easier than 			it is, 			and wind 			will be taken out 			of the 			sail of 			the opponents 			of the 			removal of 			untoucha- bility. 			I hope 			therefore that 			no Harijan 			will say, ‘First 			remove un- 			touchability, and then 			we shall 			abstain from beef or 			do many other 			things expected of 			us.’ Such an 			attitude will 			be just 			as bad 			as the 			atti- tude 			of those 			who would 			impose conditions on 			their admission to 			temples and 			the like.

 December [8]libtech_284_footnotelibtech_285_footnote, 1932
 MY DEAR ANGADAlibtech_286_footnote,
 You do not [know] how glad we all are when we hear from you. So we were delighted to have your letter of 10th November. This is your 3rd letter. As my companions I have only the Sardar and Maha- dev. Ba and Pyarelal were naturally taken away soon after the fast was over. But Ramdas, Surendra have been in this jail for some months
 
 and now there is Jamnalalji —the last having been transferred here for the sake of his health.
 I hope you are well in every way. With love from us all.
 Yours,

  	I hope you got my wirelibtech_287_footnotelibtech_288_footnoteand that it has healed your wound a little. I was 	pained to know that you had felt hurt, but at the same time I was 	also glad that you had such love for me. It is only the words of one 	whom we love that please or pain us.  	You wrongly feared that I had communicated to that critic, too, the 	opinion I expressed to you.libtech_289_footnotelibtech_290_footnoteOn 	the other hand, I wrote to him and told him that I had no right 	whatever to give an opinion from jail.

I have great attachment for you both and 	have told you that I want a good many things from you. How can  I 	have them unless I am able to win your heart? I shall never forget 	that early morning scene on the beach. I will go through your farce 	if  I get the time. I will read it with your eyes and write to you 	if I have anything to say. I would not use the freedom you have 	granted me, and you also need not stop the sale. I do not wish to 	persuade you to do that even through strength of our mutual love. It 	is true that I have not read any of your books. I will, therefore, 	try to read them if you recommend any.  	We shall discuss art in person if and when God brings us together.

  	If there was any error in this, let the blame be mine, for I have 	drawn all of you into a very risky experiment. It is as dangerous as 	putting one’s hand into a snake’s hole. I don’t regret it. It 	will be continued and I am sure that its ultimate result will be 	good. It will re- quire sacrifices and we will make them. [From 	Gujarati]  Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, Vol. II, p. 	313       December 9, 1932 One of the friends who attended the 	meeting of Anti- Untouchability League, which because of the prior 	body founded by Mr. 	V. R. Shinde bearing practically the same name will henceforth  	be called, and in my opinion more appropriately, the Servants of Un- 	touchables Society, gave me a list of several questions with 	argument woven into them. For the sake of brevity, I reproduce the 	most important of these questions in the form of a letter:  As 	the Society has 	been formed at 	your instance and 	for the purpose of 	carrying out 	the programme for the removal 	of untouchability, 	workers  naturally 	would expect your definite guidance. The 	first question that 	occurs to me then is this: Are the workers to constitute themselves as reformers, doing    
 work of uplifting untouchables or uplifting themselves and if it is to be the latter, should not the greatest stress be laid upon work amongst caste Hindus themselves, and if so how is that work to be done?
This is a comprehensive question and in answering it, I hope to
 be able to cover the main points raised by my friend. I have repea- tedly declared in unequivocal terms that caste Hindus are sinners who have sinned against those who are called untouchables. Caste Hindus are responsible for the present condition of the untouchables. Imme- diately, therefore, they repent for the sin and purify themselves by removing the load of untouchability from off the backs of un-touch- ables, we shall discover perfect transformation among the latter. Not that they will at once shed the habits of a lifetime, but there would be conscious effort on their part to shed those habits and everywhere the multitude of caste Hindus will be helping them to give up those habits.
 It would be like the suppressed members of a family rejoining the suppressors, feeling the warmth of reunion and suppressors receiv- ing them as if they were never separated. I am painfully conscious of the fact that such a consummation will take some time before it comes, but it will never come unless some of us understand and adopt the right attitude. Even among the liberal-minded workers, I have often heard the opinion expressed that untouchability should be removed only when the Harijans give up their bad habits, educate themselves and live clean lives utterly forgetting that Harijans cannot do these things whilst they remain untouchables. Even if they would,  they forget also that individual Harijans who are living decently are not received on terms of equality by caste Hindus and the very best amon- gst them are denied the ordinary amenities of life every day and con- tact with caste Hindus. Their birth constitutes the automatic cause for the penal servitude for life which cannot be commuted by any change in manners or any other consideration. Hence there is and can be no incentive to better their mode of life. The idea has taken deep root in their minds that they may hope for no redemption at least during their present lifetime.
 The only way therefore is to undo the mischief and make them realize the dignity of their status as men. Caste Hindus should first un- conditionally take them up as their very own and then and then only can a change in their condition on a vast scale take place. Therefore the first and foremost items in the programme of work should be a whirlwind propaganda for educating and canvassing opinion among
 caste Hindus. This work can be done by personal visits on a most intensive scale and by flooding the country with literature on the subject.
 In my opinion untouchability is as self-demonstrated a sin as untruth. The proposition does not need the support of Shastras. Nevertheless, as there is a body of learned men who invoke the aid of Shastras in order to justify untouchability by reason of mere birth, it would be well for workers to arm themselves with pro-reform litera- ture. There is a growing body of learned men in Shastras who em- phatically hold that untouchability as it is believed  and  practised today, has no support whatsoever in the Shastras.
 This propaganda can only be entrusted to workers who have character to lose, those who will not be easily ruffled by insults, who have patience to listen to counter argument and wit enough to combat it. In a movement of religious reform, there is no room whatsoever for coercion in any shape or form. Reformers will have to submit to their fate if as a result of this personal canvassing it is discovered that a vast majority of Hindus have no sense of sin about untouchability or even otherwise are averse to its removal and the consequent raising of the Harijans’ status. They will have then without being irritated against the majority shown by personal suffering that they are in the right and the majority in the wrong and this they can best do by making common cause with Harijans and voluntarily denying themselves those rights and conveniences which are today denied to Harijans.
 Such an act of self-denial by a large body of men and women will by itself fill the Harijans with hope and raise them in their own estimation and encourage them to an effort for self-improvement. The most effective work that can be done among caste men is to induce them to take one Harijan at least per family either as member or at least as domestic servant. There is an ancient practice in well-to-do households never to take their meal without having at least one guest to share it with them. Nowadays this is more observed in the breach than in the performance. This act is described as one of the five daily yajnas or sacrifices. I cannot conceive of a better mode of offering this yajna than that of having a Harijan to share the meal with us.
 This must not be confused with inter-dining. For me, inter- dining means dining with those who may touch your food and whose food you may touch but dining together under the same roof without the mutual touch does not mean inter-dining.
 If untouchability of Harijans is removed, there can be no objection to their sharing the family meal precisely on the same terms as other castes. There are again innumerable social functions and ceremonies to which Harijans are never invited by caste men. Their cattle and other domestic animals may share their joys and sorrows but not Harijans or, if they do, these are occasions when they are pointedly reminded that they are not the same sort of human beings as caste Hindus.
 I have pointed out only a few illustrations of the kind of pro- paganda and work that can be and should be done amongst caste men to purge themselves of the sin but, even as special treatment and care are bestowed upon a banished member of the family when he is recalled, so will caste men do the work amongst Harijans themselves when the sense of sin has really dawned upon them. They will then go to the Harijans not as teachers or donors but as debtors going to their creditors to discharge their obligations and in that humble spirit they will offer to teach them, their children and otherwise help them in every way possible for them.
 It has been suggested that if this constructive programme is  taken up, it would prove too expensive and too long-drawn-out to be of immediate service, and to do it would be a programme by itself on the part of a handful of reformers. It assumes a different shape when it is conceived as an item in the programme of self-purification. A tree is judged by its fruit and so has the changed spirit of caste men to be judged by its results. It is, therefore, not enough for them to be able to say that they have touched half a dozen Harijans during the day or even that they have fed a Harijan but their newly born affection for them should make them impatient to render this neglected portion of humanity every help that it is in their power to render.
 After all, Harijans themselves have to feel the effect of the new awakening in Hinduism and they cannot do so unless caste men come in contact with them in every walk of life and every activity. If the awakening is universal, constructive programme will not prove expen- sive. Local volunteers will work in their own localities without needing any payment and if the awakening is not universal it becomes the double duty of workers to tackle the constructive programme.
 Therefore, whether it is slow or quick, expensive or inexpensive, I have no doubt it must be the integral part of the activities of the society. It may not be able to overtake all Harijan children, or all
 Harijan sick needing medical aid but whatever is done in that direction will count and should be an earnest of more to come.
 Moreover the monetary contributions will be the index of the extent to which caste Hindus have responded to the call of the age. In this programme temple-entry occupies the most important place, for, when the innumerable public temples are opened to Harijans they will immediately feel the dawning of a new era for them. They will forget that they were once the outcastes of the society. Intermingling at temples will of itself induce a change in their outlook and in their lives. They will forsake their objectionable habits. But say some of my correspondents:
 What are temples worth today? They are dens of iniquities. All kinds of practices are going on there.
I have a cutting before me containing a letter from a lady draw-
 ing an ugly picture of what is going on in a famous temple. I do not know how far charges made against some of these celebrated shrines are true. There is no doubt that temples are not what they must have been when they were built. Temple-reform in itself is a separate subject. Their deterioration cannot be pleaded as valid reason for not opening them to Harijans and I know that vast mass of poor people who visit these temples are untouched by corruption that may be going on in them; and whatever may be true of famous temples is un- doubtedly not true of village temples. Village temples were and even now are a place of refuge for villagers. It is difficult to conceive the life of a Hindu villager being regulated without his temple. Whether it is birth or death or marriage in a Hindu family, temple plays a pro- minent part.
 Therefore, Harijans must have access to it. But says another correspondent:
 If you do not insist on Harijans conforming to certain regulations such as cleanliness, you will lower the already tottering reputation of temples.
I anticipate no such catastrophe. What I have said is that no
 special condition should be laid down for the entry of Harijans that is not applicable to every other Hindu worshipper.
 I heartily endorse that suggestion of Dr. Bhagwandas that in- stead of untouchability senselessly attaching to birth, it should attach to   individual’s   outward   conduct.libtech_292_footnoteOne    cannot   regulate   inward
 
 cleanliness but it is possible to regulate outward conduct and therefore those whose habits are unclean, who are unwashed and unkempt, who are drunk, should be regarded untouchables till they have cleaned them-selves even as every human being all the world over in decent society is untouchable whilst he is in a dirty condition from any cause whatso-ever. But under the cover of specious argument as cleanliness, etc., Harijans should no longer be kept without payment of the debt due to them by caste men.
 The first step therefore is to receive them as they are, subject only to general regulations, not specially imposed for the occasion, but the regulations that have been in vogue before reforms came. New regulations may undoubtedly be framed after freedom of Harijans is honestly declared and assured to them.

         DEAR 	DR. ALTEKAR,     December 	9, 1932 
  	I thank you for your letter and the pamphlet sent by  you. Copies 	sent by you before were also received. Your pamphlet is very 	seasonable.  	You say that my view that untouchability is not countenanced by 	Hinduism will not be acceptable to the average orthodox Hindu.    
 Whether it will be acceptable or not is not the point. The question is whether there is any warrant for belief in untouchability as it is practised today. I am fully aware that there is untouchability in the Smritis, and perhaps also in the Vedas; but that acttaches not to birth but to external practice. If you do not mind, I would like you to exa- mine the question from the standpoint suggested by me. According to the Smritis, what is the definition of untouchability? Is that untoucha- bility incurable by any penance whatsoever? And what are the disa- bilities of untouchables?

  	I thank you for your letter. I can entirely enter into your fee- 	lings, but I would plead for a little patience. If caste Hindus do 	anything in connection with untouchability, I fully recognize that 	it must be in the spirit of service and not that of patronage, and I 	am quite clear in my mind that there should be no idea whatsoever of 	taking any political advantage of the suppressed classes. The 	Societylibtech_296_footnotethat 	has been formed has therefore been kept wholly free from politics. I 	have repeatedly said that removal of untouchability for caste Hindus 	should mean repentance. I therefore share your sentiment to the full 	that you should not be spoon-fed and that you should work out your 	own salvation. I would like you to keep yourself in touch with me 	and draw my attention to anything which you may consider to be 	improper or undesirable in the programme or work of the new Society.

 MY DEAR CHARLIE,"

 December 9, 1932
  	I have your letter of 12th November only today. If it was an airmail 	letter, it should have been received about the 22nd of Novem- ber. 	Your letter therefore seems to have gone through the  whole  circuit 	of examination before being delivered to me. I shall enquire. I am 	surprised that there should be any question arising as to whether I 	could do untouchability work more effectively as a free man than as 	a prisoner. I should think that it is a self-evident proposition 	that I could do more effective work as a free man. At the same time 	I can fully appreciate the Government standpoint. So long as they 	feel that civil disobedience must be put down at any cost and that 	their plan might be frustrated or checked if I was left free to 	carry on civil disobe- dience propaganda, they are bound to keep me 	under detention unless I would give them an assurance, be it even 	verbal, that I would not carry on civil disobedience propaganda. For 	my part, however much I may wish to confine myself wholly to 	untouchability work, I cannot without a full knowledge of the 	circumstances outside give any under- taking as to my future action. 	After all civil disobedience under given circumstances is as much an 	article of faith with me as removal of untouchability. I can 	therefore never say beforehand what will occupy my attention 	exclusively or for the most part at a given mo-ment and since a 	civil resister bargains for the punishment he receives for his 	resistance, he must not fret over it. Therefore and to that extent I 	am content with my lot. I hope this tells you clearly how I stand.  	I hope you got there no alarming report about my little fast over 	Appasaheb Patwardhan. I need not, give you the details about the 	event for you must have seen them in the papers. All I need say is 	that except for a little weakness there is no ill effect left of the 	fast. I hope too that you are finding no difficulty in understanding 	and appre- ciating the temple-entry question and the contemplated 	fast. I 	hope that you are keeping your health in spite of the stress.  	Dr. Ansari is wonderful. If he is there, give him our love and tell 	him that our prayers always ascend to heaven for his complete re- 	covery. 
 If what you say about the communal decision turns out to be true, it is a silver lining to the dark cloud.
Love from us all.

  	I was unable to write to you earlier. You have faced an inter- 	esting question. I think that Christians who have no desire to 	prose- lytize can render substantial help to the Anti-Untouchability 	Move- ment by working under or with the ordinary Hindu 	organizations. The constructive work to be done covers such a wide 	field that there can never be too many workers. In so far as 	Christian Untouchables     come 	to in their deliberations	is 	that outright and 	unadulterated  	non-co-operation  is to be the policy that is to be adopted by them towards our men	” 	(S.N. 18657).   . 	without trying to 	change their religion	” 	(S.N. 18633). 
 are concerned, I do not mean to say anything. I observe from the correspondence I am receiving from Christian friends that the Hindu movement has quickened the conscience of Indian Christians and they are impatient to get rid of the taint of untouchability in their midst. I think I have sufficiently answered your question.

         DEAR 	FRIEND,     December 	10, 1932 
  	I have your letter. I see clearly that you have not been studying my 	writings. I must adhere to my statement that there is no coercion 	about the temple-entry movement and so far as I am concerned there 	will be none.    No 			temple will 			be touched, caste 			or no-caste, 			where the majority of 			bonafide 			temple-goers 			within the 			locality surrounding a 			particular temple 			oppose the admission 			of untouchables. There 			will be no defiance 			of law.  If 			the managers 			are owners, 			unless they consent 			no entry 			will be 			attempted, even 			if the 			temple-goers may 			be in favour 			of untouch- 			ables’ entering.  Where 			managers are trustees 			in respect 			of a 			public temple, 			they should 			be expected 			to carry 			out the wishes 			of the 			majority of 			temple-goers.  No 			coercion will 			be exercised 			against the minority. 			I have 			already suggested that 			for them, 			if they 			are agreeable, 			certain hours of the 			day according to 			their numbers 			may be 			set apart 			for exclusive 			worship by 			them. In 			short, every attempt 			is being 			made not to 			hurt the 			religious susceptibilities of 			any person. 			I do 			not know the meaning 			of your 			reference to 			my statement about Sankaracharya.   I 	would ask you to re-read what I have saidlibtech_306_footnotelibtech_307_footnoteabout 	the unfavo-

 [Before December 11, 1932]libtech_309_footnote
 CHI. JAMNALAL,
 I got both your letters. I have to cope with extremely heavy pressure of work, and, moreover, since my views regarding Kamalnayan are not the same as yours, I did not think it necessary to write imme-diately. I had, therefore, intended to write to you at the first available opportunity. I was going to write today in any case when I got your second letter. One may feel after reading it that your health had become a little worse, but I have no fear of that happening. It is good that the discharge has started again. It will not help you in any way if it is stopped with artificial means. The cause for the cramp in the stomach may be that you probably ate something in excessive quantity. On one or two days recently the bread was not properly baked. Perhaps you will find toasted bread easier to digest. You have sufficiently strong teeth for that. I am sure you know that bread  should be chewed thoroughly. The bread can be toasted for you here, for it is supplied to you from our ward. And as I have a hand in baking the bread, there will be no difficulty in supplying you toasted bread. If you eat bread at all the three meals, fresh toasts can be prepared for all of them and supplied to you.
 You should also not give at present, as you have been doing, too much time to interviews connected with business. According to Dr. Modi, complete rest is essential. It is not advisable even to talk much. To derive the full benefit of the air of this place, it is extremely essential that you should take complete rest and talk very little.
 
 
 Colonel Doyle talked with me about you for a fairly long time. We had a talk just the day before yesterday. His advice was that you should go to Europe. I don’t think that necessary at all. We should do our best with whatever help we can get in this country and rest satis- fied. Do let me know, however, if you wish to go to England. I also expect to get in a day or two a reply to my requestlibtech_310_footnotefor permission to see you frequently.
 And now about Kamalnayan. You will require special permission if you wish to send him to South Africa. He will not get proper facilities for education there, He will not be admitted to any English school or college. They have started a college for Indians, but from our point of view it can have nothing special to offer. Facilities for private education will also be meagre. As for Phoenix, it is in the midst of a jungle. If Kamalnayan goes and lives there, he will have to spend most of his time working in the press. From all points of view, therefore, South Africa should be left out of consideration. But it is otherwise with Ceylon. Kamalnayan can join any one of the schools there. The climate of Nuwara Eliya is excellent. There is hardly any place which can surpass it in the beauty of natural surroundings. We will also find there a large number of persons whom we know. Bernard Alovihari is a close friend. He is a very good scholar and a man of character. He was on the same boat with me when I returned from England. He belongs to one of the ancient families of Ceylon. If Kamalnayan does not feel happy there, we can immediately call him back. You can also write to him frequently and so can he to you. According to me, therefore, Ceylon is the only country to which we can send Kamal-nayan to satisfy his desire for learning  English, without sacrificing our principles. He also likes the idea. If, however, you do not approve of it, let him remain at Wardha for the present. If he is happy there, we can desire nothing better than that. But I gathered from my conversation with him and knew from his letter that he was not happy in Wardha. That is how the problem arose.
 Manilal, who was to leave on Wednesday, has had to postpone his departure. He can now leave on the 29th.
Chhaganlal Joshi arrived here yesterday to help me. This will
 
 not lighten my burden, but work will not remain unfinished to the same extent as it did every day till now.

 hurry and my claim you know. I do not act on my own, but I act in obedience to the inner prompting. Whether it is the voice of the divine or the devil, it is not always easy to say. Nevertheless in each case the claim to the inner prompting may be held to be justified.

237,"December 11, 1932",LETTER TO NANABHAI I. MASHRUWALA,"
      
 December 11, 1932
 First about Appasaheb. One should serve untouchables wherever one finds them. Moreover, persons serving the cause of anti-untou- chability ought not to be silent witnesses to people who are not untou- chables being treated as such. Appa’s tapashcharya in this regard is not a new thing, and his demand was not that he should be permitted to do a particular kind of work in place of another, but that he should not be prevented from doing what he regarded as  his  dharma.  I cannot go into further details on this subject. However, I did not have even a moment’s doubt about the propriety of Appasaheb’s step or about the step I intended to take. Nor have I any doubt about it now after the matter is over.
 Now about the issue of temple-entry. It would of course be ille- gal on the part of the trustees if they go beyond their authority in doing anything. The present movement is not intended to force the trustees to take any illegal step. However, if the people on whose behalf they are acting as trustees desire a particular step to be taken, it becomes their duty to secure legal sanction for it. If the people are against a proposed step, a fast [to force the trustees to take it] would be blackmail, and a poll is being taken to prove that the intended fast is not of such character. If the majority of people express themselves against Harijans being permitted to enter temples, then I will not fast on that issue. But other more difficult duties will arise for us then, which it is unnecessary to discuss now. If a temple belongs to a parti- cular sect, we cannot insist on people outside its fold being permitted to visit it, but the Harijans belonging to that sect must have the right to
 enter it. This question, however, does not arise at all in the case of the Guruvayur Temple. The idea of fasting has a purely spiritual aim. Without it, it would be impossible to overcome our inertia. Whenever a religion had lost its vitality, men of sincere devotion went through extreme tapashcharya to restore life to it. Without such tapashcharya, no religious awakening can be brought about. If a person disappears into a jungle and undertakes an indefinite fast, nothing can be said against his step. It would of course be considered foolish if anyone did that ignorantly. But the step would be regarded as irreproachable if taken with a spiritual aim. A lighter step than that by me in the present circumstances would be fully justified. I say ‘lighter’ because my fast will not be absolute or unconditional. The fast will end if a certain condition is accepted. In laying down a condition one should exercise discretion and self-restraint, and I believe that I have done so in the present instance. Being conditional, the fast will shock  the  people less to that extent. My relation with the people  has  now  become a family bond. For many years I have trained myself for such a bond, and I have seen from personal experience that, within certain limits, fasting has a place in domestic relationships. Even in  that  sphere, one must of course exercise self-restraint. It is after experimenting in the small family circle that I have widened the field of practice. I have tried to explain the idea so as to convince your reason, but the truth is that I have never undertaken any of my fasts after rational consideration, but that each one of them was under- taken in obedience to the inner voice. I do not mean to say that there can be no error in this. There goes on in the heart a ceaseless battle between the divine and the demoniac. We cannot always judge when it is the demon that deludes us or the divine that leads us. It is for this reason that religion enjoins that everybody who wishes to awaken the divine in him should walk on the razor’s edge of the yamaniyamas.

 You should know that I have suggestedlibtech_315_footnotethe changes in food in order to improve the health of the people and increase their self- control and peace of mind. Those who do not like them may not try them. Those who have tried them and found that they do not suit them may give them up. Nobody should accept them unwillingly or out of false shame.

 on writing as often as necessary. Is wheat, bajri and jowar flour con- sumed whole? Where do you get the grain ground? Those who eat four times a day may continue the practice. My point was that nobody should eat between meals. Eating off and on does a great deal of harm. I hope that the shortage of ghee has been met. Does not Shankarbhai take milk? He should not pay excessive attention to his piles.
 Raojibhai’s demand seems to be reasonable. I hope Dahibehn has taken away Balbhadra.
 Ask Soman to write to me. He should increase his weight. But he should take care that in his attempt to do so he does not fall ill. How did Jamna become ill? I hope she is all right now.

 CHI. PRABHUDAS,
 I got your letters. I have had talks with Sarojinidevi and Padma. It is not permissible to see Sitala Sahai and so I have not met him. I have the impression that unknowingly you have yielded to impure thoughts about Padma. The impurity can be clearly seen in your letter. It is not possible for a man to conceal his impure thoughts. The behaviour of you two towards each other was not that of a brother and sister. The scandals that were doing the rounds were justified. Still, I do not wish to blame you. There was no end to your foolishness. I should not have allowed any girl to come into contact with you. Now that my eyes have been opened, I will make some other arrangement for Padma. She has understood. As for Sitala Sahai, he is extremely unhappy. I have consoled him. Marriage is the best remedy for you. By all means get married. It will be better if you find a widow as your partner. If that is not possible in any circumstances, you may do as you wish. Whomsoever you choose to marry, tell her all the facts about your body. If you thus marry, the question will arise as to what will happen to the Ashram which you will have left. At the moment, I can say without thinking over the matter further that there will be no harm if you stay on for the present. We can consider later what should be done. If you do this, a salary can be fixed for you with which you
 
 may meet your household expenses and may also attend to khadi and other work. If you give the Khali to somebody, you will get money for that. Do not in any way feel helpless. I am not accusing you of anything. It is only a recognition of the true situation. If you wish to suggest any change in this, write and let me know. If you wish to see me, you may come and meet me. Let me know if you have a girl in mind. I have sent Chhaganlal an account of the matter.
 Padma has asked to be permitted to write to you. I have given her the permission to do so through me. It has not finally  been decided what should be done about her.
 I have no fears on your account. In the end, all will certainly be well with you. I have not lost my faith in you. We are quite happy. Chhaganlal Joshi is here."

Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 18693           December 12, 1932 My fast 	ought not to disturb you. It is part of discipline. It is a 	privilege earned by hard spiritual toil. It is a most powerful 	weapon in the 	armoury of a worshipper of truth and ahimsa. It has therefore to  	be used sparingly. Not every one can use it. You should therefore 	rejoice that I can use it. This assumes that with me it is 	spiritually used. If I am self-deceived, Heaven help me and all you 	who have faith in     
 me. But if you grant its spirituality in my case, then coercing fast of mine should be a thrill of joy and a source of strength for you. It must move all those who have love for me but that movement should mean a spur to greater performance of duty. I know you can have no difficulty in grasping what I have written. You shall no longer there- fore grumble when you learn about my fast in future. Who knows when the next fast will come!

 I suppose Jijima is the same lady I saw at a public prayer, and with whom I even joked a little. The news of her paralysis has not shocked me very much. She must be older than I at any rate. Write to her and tell her that all of us are bound to fall into the eternalsleep through some cause or another. Why, then, should we mind whether it comes through paralysis or some other illness? By all means she should hope to live for a hundred years; but if she must embrace our friend, Death, she should do so smilingly. The prayer that was recited at the prayer-meeting which she attended is recited here daily at night, so that we may learn how to die with a smile on our face. She should ponder over its last verse.

 December 12, 1932 All descriptions of the atman are of its pure state, just as a description of water can be of pure water only. There cannot be one
description of dirty water. If water could think, every pool of dirty
 water would ask the same question that you have done, and one of them might describe the qualities of pure water and exhort its fellows to become like that. This is exactly what Shri Krishna, who knew the qualities of the pure atman, did. We should know what these qualities are and try to become such atman. If you ask me how the atman
 
 becomes impure, my reply is that I do not know it, nor need we know it. We know that impurity is a fact, what the qualities of the pure state are and how we may get rid of the impurity. That should be enough for us. If I have not answered your question, you may ask me to explain again.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got your letter of the 10th. Radha’s case is rather alarming. As she has been running continuous temperature going up to 103  degrees, I think she must have become very thin and weak. Kusum seems to be improving slowly. If you have now got more information about Jethalal who died in the Sabarmati jail, to what term he was sentenced and of what he died, for what offence he was arrested, etc., please let me know.
I got Mithubehn’s, Bhansali’s and Kanti’s letters.

 DEAR SISTER,
 This letter of yours is quite perfect. Hindu ladies usually write an atrocious hand, but the letters from Muslim ladies are all good. That is why I do mind when any letter is not up to the mark. Good that my teasing has accomplished all this! Let us hope that Doctor Saheb makes a full recovery this time.

 December 13, 1932
 I was delighted to receive your letterlibtech_328_footnoteso full and instructive. I wish you could have discussed your position with me before sending your letter to the Premier; but nothing is lost yet, and if you can con- veniently spare the time, I would love to see you and discuss the thing with you. Meanwhile, I present my doubts:
  Do 	you mean 	to say 	that under no 	circumstances can 	Hindu Law or 	Hindu practice be 	changed by Hindu public opinion ?  Do 	you say that Smritis 	are unalterable 	and that 	everything said in them has to be carried out to the letter by a devout Hindu?  Were 	not Smritis 	written or 	revealed in response 	to the requirements 	of the age in which 	they were written? Were 	not the Smritis 	written at different times?  If 	you hold 	that under 	no conceivable 	circumstance can 	legislation alter 	prevailing practice, how 	would you 	deal with the 	legal difficulty 	which is supposed to exist in Madras, viz., that even one man 	can under the law 	decided by 	the present 	courts, prevent the 	entry of untouchables 	to certain 	temples in spite 	of the 	consensus of 	public opinion 	in favour 	of such entry?  Or, 	do you 	hold that 	the existing temples 	can never  be  opened to untouchables?  Or, 	is not your opposition to 	legislation based on 	the assumption 	that the mixed 	legislatures would be 	interfering with 
 
 reason which led me to address the letter is that I apprehend that hasty reformers will force by legislation, temple-entry and such like reforms down the throats of the orthodox Hindus of India who are voiceless, not being represented in the R.T.C. or the Legislative Councils.       Subsequently came your declaration published in   The
 Times of India , that if you had the power you would make it an offence under the Penal Code for anyone to refuse to touch the Harijans. This was the last straw that broke the back of my silence and I at once addressed a letter on the subject to Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, President, 3rd R.T.C., requesting him to introduce a section in the new Constitution like the one existing in the present Government  of  India  Act, prohibiting future legislatures from passing any laws forcing reforms in religious and socio-religious matters.        I  feel strongly on the subject of non-interference by the
 State Legislatures in such matters and I thought it my duty to do what I can for it at this juncture” (S.N. 18669).
 Hindu religion, although if Hindu opinion was taken, such legislation would be found to have no public backing?
  What 	objection would you 	see to the 	mere Hindu legis-lators 	first passing 	legislation regarding Hindu religion and 	then for 	the sake of 	formality it 	being passed by 	the whole 	House or Houses 	as the 	case may be.  Who 	are untouchables 	according to the 	Vedas, or, 	if you 	like, traditional 	Hindu religion?  Does 	untouchability attach 	to birth and 	persist from 	generation to generation?  Is 	such untouchability 	incurable by 	any penance 	or puri- 	fication undergone by 	such untouchables?  Is 	prohibition against 	interdining and 	intermarriage an 	integral part of 	varna dharma?  Is 	varna dharma fully 	performed if 	a man 	belonging to 	one varna desists from 	dining with 	those belonging 	to a 	different varna 	and from contracting 	marriage relations 	with people 	of a 	different varna?  Does 	a person 	so interdining 	or intermarrying 	forfeit his 	varna?  Is 	not occupation 	the test 	of varna, 	and ‘does 	not a 	person who 	changes his 	occupation, say, 	Brahmin, to 	that of 	another varna, 	pass on to that varna, or, it may be, forfeit his right to any varna at all? 
 I will not exhaust your patience nor tax your energy by adding to the already long list of questions, nor do I want you to burn mid- night oil in order to be prompt in your reply, as you always are. Per- haps you will be able to give in a sentence or two an exhaustive answer which will cover all the points that have occurred to me. Anyway I shall look forward to your reply, and still more eagerly to your saying that you will make time to come to Yeravda to see me. I suppose you are older than I am, but I am sure that it does not interfere with your vigour.

 December 13, 1932
 MY DEAR NAGESWAR RAO,
 I have your letter. My message to you is that I hope Andhra will be to the fore in removing the blot of untouchability of Hinduism.
 As to the interviewlibtech_329_footnotewith Shree Suryanarayana Rao,  I  do  not think there is anything to send to the Press. Nearly three-fourths of the long time I gave him was passed in reading some correspondence with his guru and then discussing with him his own credentials or qualifications for knowing all about Hinduism. He quoted some verses from the Bhagavad Gita to convince me that untouchability was countenanced by it and that it attached to birth, but he left on me the impression that public opinion in the general interest of the commu- nity demanded removal of the bar against the entry of avarnas to temples, and that so far as the other disabilities were concerned they should certainly be removed. But he was emphatic that there should be no force used in connection with temple-entry, but that efforts should be made in a conciliatory manner to persuade custodians of temples to throw them open to untouchables wherever public opinion was ripe. Naturally there was no question of our agreeing, but the attempt was made to understand each other’s position and he said that as he understood what it was that I was exactly fighting for, he would try to collect together the sanatanists in the South and procure a settlement. Whilst I am dictating this, Ramchandra Rao is here, and he generally confirms my impression. If Sjt. Suryanarayana Rao has said anything that is inconsistent with this statement, you should show this to him before publishing it, or, if you come to the conclusion that my statement should be published in any case, then, too, it should not be published without its being first shown to him.

 December 13, 1932
 MY DEAR SADASHIV RAO,
 I am glad you are keeping me informed of your doings there. The resentment even against Ba was bound to come.  We  should submit to all this cheerfully as a matter of course, and if we do, that is to say, do not even mentally resent the orthodox resentment but appreciate that if we were in their place probably we would have done likewise, you will find that in an incredibly short time this resentment will spend itself for want of resistance. That anger can be conquered by want of it by the victim is a scientific fact capable of verification in day-to-day life. But I know that it is a difficult task; but whether difficult or easy, in this matter of pure religion we dare not lose self-control and retaliate in any shape or form.
 Yours sincerely,

         MY 	DEAR APPA,       December 	13, 1932 
  	I have got your two letterslibtech_332_footnote. Just at present I do not want to deal with many of 	the important issues you have raised in your letter of the 7th 	instant, but there is one thing which has complicated the matter. 	The Inspector-General did not know and has even now no official     
 knowledge that you were actually doing conservancy work. The previous orders were therefore passed in ignorance of this very material fact. It is very difficult now all of a sudden to have alterations made simply in your case. After all, what you were and are fighting for is the principle, and the question of principle is now before the Government of India. It will be decided, I am hoping, within a few days, certainly not months. For the present, therefore, I think that you should be content with the progress that has been made. Your tele- gram to me was unequivocal and therefore I think that you should take proper nourishment. Full ration does not therefore mean to me the ration as it is issued to healthy prisoners. For you to lose ten pounds is a big loss. I think, therefore, that you should take the food that may be medically prescribed, if it is not otherwise  forbidden food. The Inspector-General of Prisons has kindly given instructions, so far as I understand, that you should have the food that your constitution may at present require. I hope you have no objection to taking milk.

I had a faint impression that I 	had received one letter. So at the time of the weekly mail there was 	some confusion in my mind and I asked you to write to me. But now I 	have found the letter I wanted.  	You have raised questions of a subtle nature. It is of course likely 	that forbearance may result in unmanliness or cowardice. Were it not 	so, we would not be faced with difficult problems of what is dharma 	and what is not dharma. Generally speaking, we may say that we ought 	not to tolerate an insult if it would be spiritually degrading to do 	so. This does not happen frequently. If the question is not of 	personal convenience or amenity, we ought to resist even at the cost 	of 
 physical suffering what we were not prepared to tolerate. Everybody should decide his own limits in such a matter. Moreover, we ought to distinguish between pride and self-respect. A proud person will take offence at every little thing. He who has got rid of selfishness will probably be able to distinguish between the two. Be satisfied with this.  I did not lose six pounds in a day, but lost four pounds. I will not explain about the Appa affair in this letter. You ought to learn not to worry on account of my fasts. One should rejoice at a fast if it is inspired by spiritual motives. I am sure that my fasts are so inspired.
I hope your weight is increasing.

264,"December 14, 1932",STATEMENT ON UNTOUCHABILITY-XI,"
    
 December 14, 1932 Supposing on the strength of your statementlibtech_333_footnotethat in the event of the Referendum going against you, you would have to postpone your fast
 indefinitely, voters, although they may be in favour of Harijans entering the Guruvayur Temple, give their votes against you for the sake of preventing the fast, what would you do?
This is a question asked of me. I should hope there would be no
 such trickery resorted to by the voters. If, however, it is discovered that they have resorted to any such trickery, I can only say that they would be endangering my life more than if they voted honestly and according to their convictions.
 Having put my life at stake for the removal of untouchability, I hope I shall not be found so cowardly as to save it by taking advan- tage of any dodge. What I have said about the postponement refers only to honest voting.
 If I am satisfied that the majority of temple-goers in the neigh- bourhood of Guruvayur are really against temple-entry by Harijans, and if I still persisted in fasting, I should be guilty of using coercive measures in order to secure my end. I am not conscious of ever  having done such a thing in my life, and I am not likely to do so now,
 
 
 when I may be nearing my end, to deny the practice of a lifetime.
 I am most anxious to preserve the approaching fast against the slightest taint of coercion, and I have no doubt that at the end of it, it would be found to have been free from reproach. I am watching, as a scientist would watch, the effect the contemplated fast is producing, and it fills me with hope and delight. It has set the people thinking, and it will certainly not compel any person to act against his cons- cience; but it is making sluggish people shed their sluggishness and act promptly, that is to say, that it is moving to action those who bear affection towards me.
 I am not sorry for that movement. Those who think that I am attempting to corrupt Hinduism, write to me angry letters and invite me to anticipate the fast and thus hasten my death. I do not mind such letters. I am used to receiving them. I merely refer to them to showthat those who are opposed to the removal of untouchability are not likely to be affected by any fast that I may embark upon; and much less by the mere contemplation of it, and this is as it should be. I should like to say more about the origin of the fasting method under the given circumstances in my life. I must, however, postpone this to a future date. At the moment, I can only say that neither Srijut Kelappan nor I can be deterred from the step which has been dictated to us by our consciences.
 When every effort is being made to ensure the honesty of the Referendum, it comes as a painful surprise to me that the Zamorin is making charges of fraud against those who are engaged in the Refe- rendum work. I regard him as an honourable man. He knows that Srijut Madhavan Nair, who is the chairman of the Referendum Committee, is a well-known advocate respected throughout  Kerala, and is assisted by Srijut Rajagopalachari, who is on the spot. I do not know of any of the leading workers who would tolerate any question- able practice.
 It is, therefore, the duty of the Zamorin or any other person who may hear anything about the fraudulent practice, to bring it to the notice of the Committee. It is impossible to deal with the general charge unsupported by any evidence. There is no occasion to import passion or partisan feelings into what is purely a moral and religious question; but the orthodox party and the reformers can, if they will, work in close association for the elucidation of truth. I can only repeat my assurance so often given by me that if I found I was wrong about
 the local public opinion being in favour of temple-entry, I should immediately retrace my step. I have no other end to serve but that of truth.

 DEAR BABOO BHAGWAN DASS libtech_341_footnote,
 I have your most touching letterlibtech_342_footnoteof the 10th instant. I do not know in what connection I could have told Devi Prasadji that you and Paramarth Baboo should go to Guruvayur. I knew the condition of your health. I cannot now recall the conversation. I can blame no one, least of all Devi Prasadji, but it is not yet, thank God, too late to mend.
 In reply to Dhruvaji’s letter I sent a telegram saying it was unnecessary for you and Paramarth Baboo to come to Poona, or to go to Guruvayur. If your presence had been a necessity, I would not have hesitated to risk damage to your health, but there is no such necessity.  I did want Dhruvaji, not merely as a Sanskrit scholar, but also as Malaviyaji’s accredited agent, and I told Kerala friends long ago that they should telegraph to Malaviyaji not to trouble to go to Kerala. We do not want to rush to Guruvayur. If the caste Hindus near Guruvayur are ready to admit the out-castes to that temple, nothing can stop their entry; if they are not, we shall have to wait for their conversion. I wanted someone, well-versed in Shastraic lore to see the Shastris of Malabar face to face, and if that someone went with Malaviyaji’s authority at his back, it was enough, but now even that may be unne- cessary. Nevertheless, I want Dhruvaji to meet some sanatanists here, if only for the satisfaction of the latter. Some of them have been at me. I told them that whilst my conviction was deep and had been proof
 
 against assault for the past 45 years, since I was a fallible mortal I was open to be acted upon by any of the sanatani friends, and if I discovered that I had mistaken darkness for light, I would have no hesitation in going back upon 45 years’ conviction and be witness to truth, and it is in that spirit that I shall approach the 23rd instant, if the sanatani friends will attend the contemplated meeting. If, after all this, you feel drawn towards Yeravda, do by all means come, and if you do, do not come to rush away. There will be work enough and to spare for you for a few days. It is unthinkable to disturb Malaviyaji. I know that he has his hands full.
 I hope you did not miss my statementlibtech_343_footnotewherein I wholeheartedly endorsed your suggestion that whilst there is and should be no untouchability regarding birth, there should be as there always has been throughout the world untouchability with regard to particular kinds of work, and that such untouchability was always curable after due cleansing.
 Your last  paragraphlibtech_344_footnoteis  the  most  touching  in  your  touching letter. I would not be truthful if I did accept your certificate, for it has been a lifelong effort to hear the voice of silence and to reduce self to zero. It has been a terrific though joyful struggle. It has not ended yet. The final result God only knows. I have no doubt that my recent acts have given a shock to dearest friends but all of them have been more than good to me. I was helpless, for in reality the acts were not mine. I was dominated by the Architect of us all.

272,"December 14, 1932",LETTER TO MANIBEHN,"
    
 December 14, 1932 It is but natural that palate of a person in good health should be sensitive to, and relish for himself, the tastes of various foods, and even
the man of the highest degree of self-control will recognize and ought
 to be able to recognize, such relish. Only he should have no attach- ment to it. When one becomes accustomed to abstinence from a harmful thing—whatever the reason for abstaining from it, such absti- nence benefits the soul as well as the body as the hankering for that thing disappears. The effect of a complete or a partial fast varies with different men according to their natures and in the same person at different times. You will be able from your numerous experiences to think of cases in which the mind or the body or both of them were the cause for such difference. Not only do I feel no hardship in observing silence, but every week I eagerly look forward to one o’clock on Sunday. The fact is that we feel hardship in doing a thing for which we are not mentally ready. Anything for which the mind is ready or is made ready becomes quite easy to do. The person who becomes absorbed in silence ceases to hear the idle chatting of people around him. I hope you remember the secluded hut erected for Kishore- lalbhai. There could be nothing but peace and silence in such a place. For two or three days Kishorelal found the rattling noise made by running trains unbearable, and I suggested that he should close his ears with cotton plugs. However, when I went to him the next morning,
 
 he told me that he had heard neither the train whistle nor the noise of the running wheels on that day. Of course both these things had been there, but he had stopped paying attention to them. In other words, he had become accustomed to silence. My suggestion about the cotton plugs had roused him, for such artificial aid would be repugnant to one who has voluntarily retired into solitude and taken a vow of silence. Those who come to love silence begin ultimately to listen to the divine music within, and are so absorbed in it that they cease to hear the sounds occurring around them.
 Our cat family has three members. They present  themselves daily without fail at both the mealtimes, without a bell being rung for them or without being called. If we all become as punctual as these dear creatures, we would save millions of hours of time. And we have doubtless been taught how time is money. This is perfectly true, and so money saved is money earned. Who can compute the loss of wealth to this world through people who do not value time?
 I certainly do not wish that the number of anti-untouchability workers should increase artificially. I would never wish that those who have a clear duty before them should leave it for Harijan work, no matter how dear such work may be to them.

 December 14, 1932
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got the weekly mail. I am writing this after reading Anandi’s
letter.
 The rule about eating three times only does not apply to any-
body who is ill or weak in health. Nor does it apply to children. The
 rule which applies to all is this:
 Everybody should eat in the same manner as he takes medicine—in measured quantity and at fixed times. Somebody may even have to be fed two teaspoonfuls of something every hour. If so he should not be given that thing every half an hour.
 Thus the habit of munching something in between meals is a bad one and is violation of the vow of not indulging the palate. One should not even eat a green tamarind. But a girl like Anandi may need to eat more often than thrice. She ought not to do so just to please herself, but she may eat what is necessary for the sake of her health and as often as necessary. Children of the age of Babla may eat four times. Of course nobody should swallow in three meals the quantity that he would eat in four meals. It may help if the quantity consumed in three meals is divided into four meals, but it would be harmful to eat in three meals the quantity that one might eat in four meals.
 When one has got fever, one should not eat solid food, by which I mean wheat, jowar, bajri, rice, pulses and tubers, that is, articles which contain starch and protein. If, however, one feels hungry and passes normal stools, one may drink milk in small quantities. Fruit juices may be taken in practically any condition, though even these should not be taken if one has no appetite.
 Anybody who cannot digest jowar and bajri must not eat them. Anybody whose body—not palate—demands rice, may eat it. For those who are ill, the water in which rice has been boiled sometimes proves the ideal food. Ordinarily, rice is not essential for health and, sometimes, even does harm. Rice-eaters are generally seen to be flabby. They have round bellies. This is a common sight in Bihar and Madras. I hope I have now made myself clear.
 What shall I write concerning the Chharas? Our tapashcharya is imperfect. Our faith in God is not strong enough. We do not look upon the Chharas as our own brothers and sisters. We are afraid of them. I deserve this charge more than anybody else. My shortcomings have taken visible form as the camping of Chharas in the neighbour- hood of the Ashram. Endure them. Please remember that I have not advised a letter of abject supplication to be written to the Collector. I had suggested the substance of the draft after careful thought. I am, therefore, certainly eager to know what action Mavalankar has taken. I hope you yourself had followed my mean-ing. I see in this situation a severe test of our devotion to dharma. From here, I see our dharma
 quite clearly. Any man or woman, old or young, who has courage and faith in God, should go and live among them, plead with them and, even if they beat him or her, show them the right path. We should know how they live. If, however, we do not have the necessary strength to do all this, we should think and decide whether we are willing to defend ourselves by fighting the Chharas. If we are willing to do that, we should decide whether we should seek the Government’s help and, if not, whether we could engage paid watchmen and from which com- munity or class we would select them. If, on the other hand, we do not wish to engage such watchmen, we should decide whether we would fight as best as we could, or whether we would prefer not to abandon our path and, though we did not possess sufficient strength to follow it well, we would be content with as much as we could do in that direction. I think I have said enough. I hope nobody will get scared. I have written all this so that people there may think over the problem.
Prema’s operation must be over.

 Please let me know what Mavalankar has done. I am thinking
what can be done in that direction.

 December 14, 1932
 In response to ‘namaste’ by the deputation, Mahatmaji welcomed them with a smile. He spent an hour and a half in discussing the subject of untouchability from Shastraic point of view. He said that he was aware of the activities of Arya Samaj in this direction, and hoped that Arya Samaj would continue it with more vigour. He directed that Arya Samaj should do propaganda work by lectures and literature and also continue more enthusiastically the constructive work among the untouchables.
 Mahatmaji said that he was fully confident about the success of the Guruvayur question from the information received from the workers. He said hundreds of volunteers had reached Malabar and the work was going on satisfactorily. Some of the sanatanist Shastris were also supporting him. The work of referendum was also going on well. He showed his indifference towards the mischievous propaganda which some of the persons had started by misrepresenting his writings, taking a sentence from here and another from there without giving reference to the context.
 On request Mahatmaji selected three books from the big bundle brought by the deputationists and being asked to have a copy of Satyarth Prakash, the ‘Magnum Opus of Rishi Dayanand’, he said in reply that he always kept that book with him.libtech_353_footnote

279,"December 15, 1932",STATEMENT ON UNTOUCHABILITY-XII,"
    
 December 15, 1932 I thought I had made my position quite clear about the limi- tations of the temple-entry agitation. But I see sanatanist friends are
still agitated over a fancied danger which they think sanatan dharma is
 facing from this agitation. I, therefore, summarize below what I have said in published statements and letters to correspondents:
  The 	method of 	fasting is 	at the present 	moment confined only to 	Guruvayur. There 	are historic 	reasons for the 	fast from a 	reformer’s standpoint. 	There was 	no escape 	from it. Those 	reasons I 	know will not be 	accepted as 	any justification 	by the 	opponents of 	reform or 	even by 	all who believe 	in temple-entry. 	My purpose 	in referring to it is merely to state the limitations of the fast.  The 	fast as 	contemplated will 	not be 	undertaken if 	the refe- 	rendum goes 	against the 	reformers. It 	will be 	postponed if 	it is found that 	the existing 	law is 	against reformers and 	that every effort is 	made for 	the necessary 	legislation and 	Viceregal sanction has 	been obtained 	for the introduction 	of a 	permissive Bill, that 	the Bill cannot  go 	 through the 	Legislature before 2nd 	January, 1933.  I 	would not 	be a 	party to 	any forcible 	temple-entry in 	de- fiance 	of the wishes 	of a majority 	of worshippers 	at the respective 	tem- ples and the 	agitation will 	be confined 	only to 	public temples. There- 	fore, the 	opening of 	private temples will 	depend entirely upon 	their owners 	and the restrictions 	applicable to caste 	Hindus will naturally be 	applicable to Harijans. 
 In my opinion, these limitations ought to satisfy any reasonable Hindu, but I know there is a body of opinion which will not tolerate the opening of any existing Hindu temple to Harijans on the same terms as to other Hindus. For such uncompromising opponents, there is no method of conciliation that I can devise short of a programme of new temple building. That means a sharp additional division in an already divided society, but I am convinced if the reformers  will loyally and honestly abide by the limitations I have suggested, the unreasonable opposition will die for want of support. Those who have arrogated to themselves the name sanatan dharma, should not be sur- prised or shocked if opponents also derive authority for reform from the same scriptures that the sanatanists profess to believe in. There is a growing body of Shastris, well versed in Sanskrit lore, who believe
 that it is not only permissible in Hinduism to admit ‘untouch-ables’ to public temples, but that it is wrong to prohibit them from offering worship in common with other Hindus at these temples. These pundits also believe that there is no such thing as untoucha-bility, attaching to birth and incapable of being cured by any penance or purification. They do believe in untouchability attaching to acts and occupations, but this is no peculiarity to Hinduism. It is common to all religions and is based upon sound hygienic principles.
 I believe, too, that the alarm caused over the proposed legislation is also based on ignorance. So far as I understand the proposal, it sim- ply amounts to this. If a two-thirds majority of worshippers at a parti- cular temple express their desire through a regular channel devised by the legislature, such temples should be thrown open to Harijans on terms of equality with others. In my opinion, the proposal itself is so intrinsically sound that no reasonable person can have anything to say in opposition to it.
 Anyway, let the opponents of reform understand exactly what the reformers seek to achieve. As it is, I am sorry to have to observe an agitation against reform being conducted in disregard of facts and that it is being sustained by statements that are contrary to truth and by baseless insinuations and imputations. Such methods can do no harm to reform if it is sound in itself, but it hurts Hinduism if the reformers or their opponents resort to methods that are less than fair and just.

  	Your letter has arrived in due time. It is now nearly 4.20 and we 	have finished the morning prayer. Chhaganlal Joshi makes the fourth 	member of the human family and if we add the feline members, we make 	seven. Only the latter won’t attend the prayers. Their recogni- 	tion of kinship is confined to the common board.  	Chhaganlal’s arrival has facilitated despatch of work, but has not 	reduced my hours of labour. It was not expected to. Things that must 	be attended to by me, have to be. The pressure must continue at 	least till 2nd January.  	What is it that prevents the heart from following or co-operating 	with reason? Can it be want of faith? Though I have not come to any 	final decision, my opinion tends in that direction. Though my reason 	tells me that there is no need to avoid a snake if I have love in 	me, it must be my want of faith that prevents my association with 	him. Instances of this character can be multiplied. I would like you 	to make researches in this direction and try to trace the cause of 	conflict between the heart and reason in every case you can recall. 	By so doing it may be possible for you to make the heart 	co-operative with reason. If it is good for me and everybody that I 	should fast, why should the heart refuse to rejoice? The heart does 	rejoice if I am healthy. It is better in certain cases that I should 	fast than that I should be healthy. Reason says so, yet the heart 	rejects the clear testimony of reason. Does it do so for want of 	faith? Or is there here self-deception and as a matter of fact 	reason has not perceived the necessity for fasting as it has for the 	preservation of health? Here I have simply stated the problem for 	you without presuming to decide. I cannot have sufficient data for 	coming to a decision even if I wanted to come to a decision. I must 	leave this subject at this point for the time being at any rate.  	My  weight  is  now  103.  I  have  reduced  the  quantity  of  	milk, knocked off bread and increased the quantity of oranges from 	eight to sixteen. Dates too have been dropped for the time being. Of 	milk I am taking just one lb. Presently I hope to increase the 	quantity of milk. 
 I have sent you Dr. Gour’s book for the information it is likely to contain. Justice Amir Ali’s is likely to be a superior book as a historical work. I may be mistaken.

 I have your letter enclosing a Session Judge’s commentary on the present agitation. I read it through. It gave me pain to find that a judge could lose balance of mind over reform carried on as it is with the greatest restraint and many limitations. The letter is one more proof to show that the reform was overdue. In some shape or form the agitation for temple-entry and complete removal of untouchability as it is being practised today has been on for years, and I am glad that the proposed fast has put life into it.
I hope that your wife is now thoroughly restored.

  	I got your letter. I understand what you say regarding Kamal- nayan. 	No arrangement can be made for him to stay in Poona. I had discussed 	the matter with Vakil. They do not accept a young man of his age, 	for they simply don’t have the necessary facility for that. We 	shall discuss the matter further when we meet. Shri Kateli knew that 	we had a stock of the swadeshi ink for fountain pen which you 	wanted, and, therefore, we have sent a bottle of it for you. We have 	quite a large quantity of it.  	The sugar used in the bread made here is probably swadeshi, for very 	little foreign sugar is available in Poona. Even if it is foreign, I 	would not consider it wrong to eat the bread for that reason, for 	the sugar is used for preparing yeast. That is, it mixes with the 	other ingredients of yeast and produces a new substance 	altogether—as two gases combine in a certain proportion and 	produce water. Hence we cannot say that when eating bread we consume 	two different articles, wheat and sugar. Three things are used for 	preparing yeast—mahura, sugar and salt. The mahura is 	indigenous. According to me, therefore, bread is innocent food even 	for a person who has taken a vow not to eat foreign sugar. However, 	after knowing all these facts it is for you finally to decide what 	you should do. If the chapatis which they prepare here agree with 	you, I certainly would not press you to eat bread.  	I have received no reply as yet to my requestlibtech_364_footnotefor permission to see you.  	I understand your reason for not going to England just now for an 	operation. Personally, I entertain no such fear at all. Thousands of 	people get discharge from their ears and suffer from no other 	disease. Since the affected parts adjoin the brain, extreme 	consequences may follow in some cases. The possibility may alarm 	doctors and they, in turn, frighten the patients. I would, 	therefore, willingly rest satisfied with whatever help is 	availablein India But this discussion is unnece- ssary just now. 	After there is a settlement, we shall know what to do.    
 There is no change in the condition of my elbow. The weight is 103 pounds. General health is good on the whole.
 I send with this Janakibehn’s letter. Please read what she writes in regard to Kamalnayan. I have told her in my reply that I would cer- tainly not agree to a tutor and a cook being sent with him. That will deprive him of the benefits of staying away from home. I have also told her that we have been discussing the matter.

287,"December 16, 1932","MESSAGE FOR ANTI-UNTOUCHABILITY
DAYlibtech_366_footnote","
    
 December 16, 1932
 I hope the message of hope born of the movement for the aboli- tion of untouchability will penetrate Harijan quarters in every village in India on next Sunday which has been fixed by the Central Board for the removal of untouchability. Every Hindu child can do some- thing by way of some little service to his or her Harijan brother or sister in this mass movement of self-purification. I have been listening to discourses of sanatanist friends with respectful attention with a perfectly open mind, and I shall continue to do so as long as they will strive with me with a view to conversion to their interpretation of Hinduism, but the conviction is daily growing upon me that untoucha- bility as it is interpreted and practised today has no sanction whatso- ever in the Hindu Shastras taken as a whole, as they must be taken. There can be no doubt that the present interpretation and practice of untouchability is utterly contrary to every canon of morality.
 When therefore the evil is banished from our midst, it will be the greatest single act of purification in modern times on thepart of caste Hindus. I, therefore, hope that there will be full response to the progr- amme issued by the Central Board.
 I would invite the sanatani friends not to stand aloof from this movement on the ground that they cannot reconcile themselves to temple-entry. Service of no human being can be contrary to religious precepts; much less can the service of Harijans be contrary to the Hindu religion which regards them as a part of the Hindu society. There are innumerable acts of kindness that they can perform by way of serving the Harijans who are truly children of God forsaken by us.
 I have seen a paragraph in newspapers about the fast of one described as Avadhut Swami. It is true that this gentleman wrote to me some letters some months ago. They were, like the many letters that I often receive, long, incoherent and irrelevant. The impression left on me was that the writer of those letters had lost his balance. He said in his letters that he had met me in 1909 or thereabouts. I have no re- collection of any such meeting, and I wrote to him to that effect. He never challenged my denial.
 
 
 I have no knowledge of the notice referred to in the Press message as having been received from him when he is supposed to have met me. At that time years ago, there was no question of fast either.
 Someone telegraphed me a few days ago saying that Avadhut Swami was fasting and would continue to do so, unless I gave up anti-untouchability propaganda. I wired to the sender of the telegram saying that he should wean the Swami from the fast.
 The movement that I hold as a part of my living faith cannot be abandoned even if a million people fast to make me give it up. To everyone the living faith comes from God, and God alone can turn him from it.

 MY DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS,
 I have sent you one telegram today about the name of the League and another about the Bengal Provincial Organization will go tomorrow.
 First, about the name. I enclose herewith Rajaji’s letterlibtech_367_footnote. I think that his argument is conclusive, and if it is at all possible to adopt his suggestion, you will alter the name accordingly. I was so possessed with the idea of service that I missed the implication to which Rajaji draws pointed attention.
 Now, as to the Bengal Organization, I fear that I have committed a grievous blunder. I overrated my influence with Dr. Bidhan. I am sorry because I have given him pain; and I am sorry because I have placed you in an awkward position. He will survive the pain; you will surmount all awkward difficulty; I shall not easily forget my folly.
I have sent Dr. Roy the following telegram:
 Your unsigned letter received today. Correspondence not meant for publication. Have told you distinctly if you feel confident you should continue work already begun. Accept my apology for what I
 
 now recognize was undue interference and what I had meant to be friendly suggestion. Please therefore treat my letter as absolutely withdrawn.—Gandhi and I enclose herewith a copy of the letterlibtech_368_footnotelibtech_369_footnoteI am sending him. I do not need to add anything more. I hope that the incident will close without causing much worry to you. I enclose also a copy of Dr. Bidhan’s reply.libtech_370_footnote
 I have received your letter of the 12th December. The definition that Sjt. Thakkar has sent you has been further altered by me. I en- close copy of the altered definition. Pandit Kunzru had sent me the definition that Sjt. Thakkar had sent you. I madealterations and sent him the altered copy.libtech_371_footnotelibtech_372_footnoteI see that Sjt. Thakkar had not received the altered copy when he wrote to you.
 I had about seven friends and followers of Dr. Ambedkar today. They complained or stated (because they said they did not want to complain but merely to make a statement) that Dr. Ambedkar’s letter to Sjt. Thakkar written on board the steamer making certain suggestions was not mentioned during the meeting of the Board in Poona. I told themlibtech_373_footnoteI did not know that it was not mentioned, but I told them also that the letter could not have been passed by and it must have been considered by the Board. You will now please write to them or me as to what was exactly done in connection with that letter.
 These friends also stated that our organizations were keeping up the split amongst the Harijans and wherever possible favouring Rao Bahadur Rajah’slibtech_374_footnotelibtech_375_footnoteparty. I assured them that such never could be your intention and that the endeavour of the Board would be to steer clear of party divisions, and that the endeavour of the Board and  its Branches everywhere would be to cement the relations between the two parties for which now that the political part of the question was settled there was absolutely no need.
Although I have got additional assistance in the shape of Sjt.

 Chhaganlal Joshi having been sent to me, as also efficient shorthand assistance, I can have no leisure. This much-needed assistance enables me to keep abreast with the growing work. Interviews take up a great deal of time, but they are all necessary. I do not therefore grudge them.
 I hope you are keeping fit. You must do something that would induce sound sleep, not by way of drugs, but through natural means or dietetic changes. Have you tried the prunes in the manner I suggested? Some of the easy asanas and deep breathing, which is what pranayam for health means, might assist digestion and induce sleep.libtech_376_footnote
     PS.  Yours sincerely,  [December 	16, 1932]    	Since dictating the above letter, I  have received the following 
 telegram 	from Dr. Bidhan:  Thanks 	for telegram. 	Respectfully submit don’t 	understand what 	you mean 	feeling confident. As 	explained in 	letter in 	view of 	present enthusiasm 	in Bengal 	any President 	and Board can perform 	anti-untouchability work. 	If however you 	mean confidence 	in obtaining 	co-operation from 	those who 	refuse it 	when offered no 	one can ensure it. 	Measure of 	success will depend on 	funds and proper 	utilization thereof. Please wire whether I 	and Board 	can rely 	on your full support if 	we continue.—Bidhanray to 	which I have sent the following reply:  	Thanks your wire. By confidence I mean self-confidence.

 I had your letter yesterday. I could not send you the reply as Sjt. Agashe gave your letter to me too late for me to send you a reply through him. I note that Sjt. Deodhar will come along with Sjt. Nata- rajan on Sunday. You and Sjt. Deodhar and other friends can decide whether to invite Dr. Kurtukoti or not. I would warn you against accepting reports. You must be sure of his views.
 With reference to the expenses, I think that the Provincial Board should approach the All-India Board. With regard to the guests who would be coming in the course of a few days, it would be best to see me about their residence, etc.
 As to the other invitations including Sjt. Vaidya, you and Sjt. Deodhar should decide. Personally, I have very great regard for Sjt.
 C. V. Vaidya. At the same time, the list ought not to become unduly long on my account.
 
 I do not know that I can give any opinion upon the artificial tea or coffee that you brought me the other day. Unless I knew how many ingredients it contained, I could not test it, and if I do not, I could not give any opinion. If the manufacturer will give you the ingredients, and if I can take it, I shall be prepared to experiment upon it.

         DEAR 	FRIEND,       December 	16, 1932 
  	I have your letterlibtech_379_footnotelibtech_380_footnote. I am sorry that the Diwan Bahadur should look at this 	movement in a bargaining spirit. I must say what I hold to be good 	and true, irrespective of consequence, and so should every 	responsible Hindu. I hope that a humble man does not cease to be 	humble when he gives expression to his innermost thoughts which he     also agreeable to admit Harijans into the inner round once or twice such as on Ekadasi  days.  	“Now 	in view of Gandhiji’s demand that they should be treated 	absolutely on the same terms as the higher castes, which he regards 	as most uncompromising he also assumes an equally uncompromising 	position and leads a movement organizing the orthodox with the 	support of all the Mathadhipatis.  	“What 	has given him greater affront was Gandhiji’s statement that it was 	the caste Hindus who were the sinners and were to perform 	prayashchitta and 	not the Harijans. He was very much excited over the idea that 	Gandhiji should have asked pious people like him to perform 	prayashchitta in 	their old age for their pious past conduct. He felt that in 	dictating like this Gandhiji’s usual humility had entirely 	deserted him and made him an avatar of haughtiness . . .” (S.N. 	18690). 
 holds to be true. I have judged no individual in saying that  cast  Hindus as such are sinners before God and man in their treatment of Harijans. An individual who is most pious may have to perform prayashchitta for the sin of the class to which he belongs. I see no dictation, either, in stating the truth andit was said by me in 1915 and was repeated since from a thousand platforms.

  SECRETARY, 	COCHIN-TRAVANCORE 	ANTI-UNTOUCHABILITY 	BOARD 	TRICHUR  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 18730         December 	16, 1932  DEAR 	FRIEND,  	I thank you for your letter of the 13th instant. You may perhaps 	know that some Shastris from Pandharpur have had long 	discussions with me, at the end of which we agreed that on the 23rd 	instant there should be a discussion between them and those Shastris 	who generally support the view I have taken. I therefore think 	that there will be a discussion on the 23rd and I suggest that the 	Shastris whom you have in mind should also take part in the 	discussion. Personally, I do not think that any terms need be 	previously fixed, but if it is necessary, they can be fixed on the 	23rd, and if a chairman is considered nece- ssary, one could be 	appointed from those Shastris who will be present on the 	23rd. Acharya Dhruva will reach Poona in any case on the evening of 	the 22nd, and he will be available so long  as  the discussions 	last. My own object in listening to such discussions is to allow my 	mind and heart to be acted upon, and if I discover a flaw in the 	attitude I have hitherto held, I should have no difficulty in owning 	my mistake and retracing my steps. Whether a discussion induces a 	change in my attitude or not, a friendly conversation between 	Shastris representing different views cannot but do good and 	result in remov- ing bitterness. I quite agree with you that the 	number of those taking part in the discussion should not be more 	than seven on either side.  	I  do  not  at  all  anticipate  that  the  discussion  to  be  	started on the 23rd can go on for more than two or, at the outside, 	three days, 
 three hours being devoted each day. There is therefore no occasion just now to think of the 2nd of January next.

  	I got your postcard. I hope Premabehn did not suffer much after the 	operation. At the time of the operation one is not conscious and 	does not feel the pain, but very often the patient suffers after- 	wards. I hope that did not happen in this case. It was in order to 	save a day that I wrote directly to Mavalankar yesterday regarding 	the problem of the Chharas.  	Just now I asked Chhaganlal the name of Liladhar’s father, and he 	tells me that it is not our practice in the Ashram to note in the 	register the full names of the inmates. Only the name by which a 	person is generally known is recorded. If this is the general 	practice, or even if it happens only in exceptional cases, it should 	be imme- diately changed. For, if the full names are not recorded, 	we may sometimes find ourselves in a difficult situation. When a 	name is first entered in the register, full particulars including 	the address should be recorded. Even when a child’s name is 	entered, the full name should be written down. The last place where 	the person lived before joining the Ashram should be mentioned in 	brackets. This is how I learnt to keep registers. If you look into 	the old registers, you will find in them all such information. You 	should, therefore, examine the whole record and, wherever the names 	are incomplete, write them in full.

 I got your letter, as also the other letters enclosed. I saw Naray- anappa yesterday. He told me that he had written several letters to you, to which he had got no reply. Let me know what the position is. He wishes to return to the Ashram. I told him that was for you to decide, and that he could return only if he satisfied you. There is still some time before he will be released.
 You did right in fasting for a day. That is the best remedy when one feels liverish. Do not eat jowar and bajri if they do not agree with you. You may reduce their quantity. It is possible that they may not agree with some people. Do not harm your health for the sake of this experiment. What is your food at present ?
 Kusum’s ship is in mid-ocean. I hope Talwalkar examines her carefully. Did he say anything after reading my letter?
 I understand what you say about Shanta. The Chharas seem to be quiet now. Did you come to know where Gangabehn and other women are kept?

  	I was delighted to have your letter, giving me the only thing you 	could properly give in my present condition. In discovering the use 	of Indian words among the Gypsies, President Masaryk and you have 	perhaps made a discovery of great value. How nice it would be if 	some painstaking and accurate scholar could follow up your dis- 	covery and ascertain whether the few common words that you dis- 	covered were a mere accident or whether they are evidence of a 	recent common origin or of intimate intercourse, or may it be that 	the Gy- psies are a set of universalists for whom the whole world is 	their coun- try? The information you give about the old President is 	also very instructive. I wish that we could emulate his energy and 	vigour.  	Mahadev is with me, Devdas sees me fairly often, and Pyarelal was 	able to see me practically only during the fast. Please send our 	love to Mrs. Datta and your boy. I can feel your difficulties in 	your new post, but God will give you strength to grapple with them.

 DEAR  LALA DUNICHAND,
 You have done well according to your wont in writing to me on the burning question.
 I think you are quite right in rejecting the evidence of the inner urge. I was bound to meet that statement, as I believe it to be true. But the public has not only the right but [it is] its duty to examine the question dispassionately and from a common-sense point of view. I have myself endeavoured therefore to reason out the justification for the steps I have taken and those that are contemplated. Therefore you do not want me to reiterate the argument I have publicly advanced in my own statements in justification. One issue however I have not dealt with publicly. You are quite right in saying that my body is not my own, but that it belongs to the nation. You will however recognize that it also belongs to God, or rather, it belongs to the nation because it belongs to God. And here I have got to state that it is God who is dealing with this body, and He will keep it intact against the whole world if He wants to use it for a service, great or small, and the whole world will not be able to keep it if God decides to take it away. Let us therefore wait upon Him and trust that whatever He does will be for our good.

          DEAR 	FRIEND,       December 	17, 1932 
  	I have your letterlibtech_385_footnotelibtech_386_footnote. Do you not remember the saying of a wise and learned 	man that the things you cannot say  and  intelligibly explain well 	inside of an hour are not worth saying or explaining? But  I 	promised you full one hour. You can still take that hour if that 	will satisfy you. Here 	are my answers to your questions:   A 		Hindu temple 		is one 		built by 		Hindus for 		worship  by Hindus 		in accordance 		with the requirements 		of Hinduism.  There 		is no such 		thing as Indian 		caste system in 		Hinduism, but 		there is 		varnashrama. And 		varna is wholly 		different from 		the current caste.  Custom 		that is 		not repugnant 		to the 		moral sense 		must be recognized by 		courts of law.  Those 		who want to 		enforce a 		custom have 		to show 		that it has 		been in 		vogue for 		a long 		time and that 		it is not 		in conflict 		with the 		moral sense, but 		the burden may 		be shifted 		if a 		custom already recog- 		nized is challenged.  A 		self-respecting court 		will not 		be bullied 		into giving decisions 		by agitations, 		but it 		would be 		governed by 		well-recognized rules. The 		question is 		answered in 		No. 1.  When 		the religious 		texts differ, 		evidence as to usage 		will be one 		of the 		determining factors. Private 		property lawfully acquired is 		entitled to protection.  Communal 		  property   is 		  also 		  entitled	to	protection	if 		communal ownership is 		not in conflict with 		the common weal.  A 		private temple is 		entitled to 		the same protection as 		pri-vate property.  I 		am not 		aware of 		anybody having agitated 		for confis-cation 		of temples      
  Simple 	suicide is an offence 	under the present 	Law as 	I have been told.  If 	Gandhi took 	up his 	stand at 	the Viceregal 	gateway and threatened 	to fast 	even for one day unless 	the British Government 	withdrew from the 	country, the 	Government would be 	justly entitled to 	arrest him and imprison him till he came to his senses.  The 	contemplated fast does 	not make it impossible 	for anybody 	to deal 	with the temple-entry 	question in a 	fearless and 	rea- sonable manner; nor 	do I 	see any sign 	that the opponents 	are in 	any way 	deterred from 	their purpose, and 	I think 	that they are quite right in ignoring 	the contemplated fast.  I am sorry to have to remark that this questionlibtech_387_footnotelibtech_388_footnoteis packed with ignorance of the true situation and is outside my limits. 
 Although I have, out of regard for you, answered  your questions, you will permit me to say that many of them are argumen- tative and take no note of the existing situation, and some of them are based upon mere assumptions. It has filled me with sorrow to discover that learned men have imagined a woeful state of things to exist and have thrown themselves into rage over the imaginary woe.

301,"December 17, 1932",LETTER TO M. M. ANANTA RAU,"
    
 December 17, 1932
 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letterlibtech_389_footnote. You will please pardon me for the frankness with which I propose to discuss it in the hope that it may open your eyes to the untenability of the position you have taken up and which you say represents orthodox opinion.
 Before I do that, let me ask why your letter-paper is so grotes- que. It cannot add dignity to the sanatan dharma by having your letter-paper printed with borders as on an address-paper, still less to have a portrait of the agent surrounded by other figures. Adver-tisers do sometimes adopt ornamentation for their letter-paper, but I have never seen anything so wholly inartistic as the paper which you are using. I restrained myself twice against drawing your attention to the incongruity of a religious agency using ornamentation, and that, too, utterly inartistic, but though my claim may be rejected, I am or am trying to be a humble representative of sanatan dharma, and there- fore, whenever anything unbecoming is done in the name of that dharma, it pains me deeply. So much by way of preface.
 Now, regarding the contents of your letter. Surely, it ought to be easy for you to see that since you admit that untouchability is quite contrary to the divine fact of oneness of all life, the only way to realize that onenesslibtech_390_footnoteis to have as little differentiation as possible, and wherever it exists, it should be accepted as an evil to be removed at the first opportunity. There is no such difficulty or impossibility about the removal of untouchability as we practise it today. You say that untouchability is based on “physical, moral and mental purity”, and you have stated as if it was a self-proved proposition. I find it most difficult to understand your statement so utterly at variance with daily experience. To claim permanence for untouchability, as you evidently claim for it, is to indefinitely postpone realization of oneness, unless you were to postulate that that realization is to come to humanity from outside sources. But I have never heard anybody saying so; on the contrary, there is complete agreement that realization of oneness can
 
 only come by incessant striving. In other words, it can only come when, in a daily increasing ratio, we obliterate differences and begin with those which are of our own creation and which have no moral justification.
 Nor can we be oblivious to the practices followed in other religions. If there is oneness of all life, there is oneness of all religions. It is, therefore, instructive, if not absolutely necessary, to test our own practice by a reference to that of other religions, and then we find that untouchability as we know it today does not exist in any  other  religion. For justifying our untouchability, therefore, we have to prove that the other religions are defective in that they do notpractise un- touchability and that it is so essential to the realization of the common goal that those religions which do not practise it will be driven to it whether they will or no. I have never heard anybody making such claim.
 Those who claim to be sanatanists have put themselves in a state of rage as if I was about to violate all that is good in Hinduism, and they have rendered themselves incapable, first, of understanding what  I am after, and then, of knowing what they are attacking. I can safely say that no two letters from among the mass of letters I am receiving from sanatanists have agreed about the definition of untouchability. They either swear at me or enter into argument that has no bearing on the subject. All this cannot be good for sanatan dharma. The corres- pondence I am having is to me a painful sign of decadence of Hin- duism.
 I invite you to ponder over what I have written, and if you find any force in my argument, study the whole question dispassionately, and if you feel with me that untouchability is an evil, courageously proclaim the truth and fight the evil.
 You refer me to the four Sankaracharyas.libtech_391_footnoteWhat shall I do by worrying them? I entertain no doubt about the correctness of my
 
 position. It is as clear to me as noon-day light. If they think that I am immersed in darkness, it is for them to show me the light.

  	This time also you are having repeated attacks of asthma. Doesn’t 	this mean that you should live somewhere else and do what- ever 	service you can? You may go and live at Wardha this time if you 	wish. You can do much service even while living there. If you have 	imbibed the spirit of the Ashram you may look after the girls who 	are being brought up in the Ashram, at Wardha. Moreover, Purushottam 	is there at present. Balkrishna also is there, and Krishna 	frequently visits the place. Have you tried Vijapur? It is a 	different matter if you have decided to remain in the Ashram, 	irrespective of how you keep there. If, however, you can preserve 	better health at some other place and the spirit of service has 	become part of your nature, it is your clear duty    
 to go and live there. Experience shows that one who has the spirit of service in him or her will feel at home wherever he or she goes.

  	I got your letter. Of course I can understand your remaining behind 	in India for the sake of your health or some such reason. Otherwise, 	we at any rate have a simple rule of duty. Just as Sita follo- wed 	Rama wherever he went, so the husband and the wife should live 	together not for carnal pleasure but for mutual service. It is, 	there- fore, proper that you should accompany Manilal.  	Fasts, etc., have become a part of my life. You need not postpone 	your departure for such a reason. One can understand either of you 	staying back at such a time if that is necessary in order to look 	after me.

 Just now I cannot write long letters. Parashuramji knows the new takli method. He does not have the same speed as Bhau but he may be able to teach you.
 Narandas is quite right in saying that any boy or girl who has not undergone training in khadi work, carpentry, farm work, tanning, dairy work, etc., has remained uneducated. It seems you have still not understood one special feature of the Ashram. It is that farm work, carpentry, etc., also are a part of your education, and develop your intellect and also some of the bodily senses. If these crafts are taught as part of your education, they would do more good, as I have already explained in one of my previous letterslibtech_394_footnoteto the Ashram, than a purely
 
 literal educationlibtech_395_footnotedoes. If you have forgotten what I said in that letter or cannot find that letter, let me know and I will write to you again about it, for the point deserves to be understood by all. Do not think that I say this because I wish to run down book-learning. I fully understand its value. You will not easily come across many men who put such knowledge to better use than I do. My purpose in saying this is to put training in crafts on the same footing as education in letters. Those who thoroughly understand this point will never be eager for a literal education at the cost of training in crafts. Their book-learning will shine better and also prove of greater benefit to the people. If you understand this fully, all of you will be ready to take out the cattle for grazing.

 December 17, 1932 Every person who is ill, holds the key to his life in his own  hands as long as recovery is possible. If he or she gives way to despair,
 no medicine will help, and, on the contrary, if he or she does not lose heart, even a simple powder will be a priceless remedy. You should, therefore, remember three rules: Do not lose courage; follow  the advice of the person in whose hands you have placed yourself; and, however much you suffer, go on repeating  Ramanama,  remain cheerful and never cry.

         BHAI 	KOTWAL,       December 	18, 1932 
  	I got your letter. The doubt which has occurred to you is a natural 	one.  	Following the path of dharma would not have been compared to walking 	on the razor’s edge, if no occasions ever arose when in doing 	one’s duty, one found oneself on the horns of a dilemma. A thing 	which is ordinarily forbidden may with a little change in the 	circum- stances become a duty. The thing is similar to the manner in 	which a chemical compound is formed. Appa’s demand was not for a 	right or privilege, nor for any personal facility. It was for 	permission to do his duty. It was my duty—and I have not the least 	doubt about this—to join Appa in his fast, as, when we were all 	free, I had already given my opinion that Appa could undertake a 	fast in the circumstances which actually arose. As this argument 	appeals to reason, it is not necessary    
 for you to go by faith in what I say. As long as your reason is not convinced, you should not accept anything more than what you have been able to understand about the ethics of fasting. Do not think too much about the matter and get confused. Ask me again if my ex- planation is not clear to you. But you need not, if you do not wish. The situation in which I found myself was no ordinary one, and in such situations too much thinking is to be avoided.
 It seems to be my clear duty to fast with Kelappan if it becomes necessary for him to do so, since it was I who had asked him to give up his fast. This involves a number of other issues, and I have no time to explain them in this letter. You will have no question to ask if you carefully go through all that I have written on the subject.
 It need not be assumed that the fast will start on the 2nd. There are many complications. The date was not fixed recently, but was fixed at the very time that Kelappan gave up his fast.libtech_398_footnoteThe agitation is not for depriving any people of their right, but for restoring their rights to those who were deprived of them. I think that I have now answered all your questions.
 What you read in the newspapers about the time limit of thirty days has no basis in fact. There is no such intention even. There is no end to the misunderstandings being spread at present by the men who come to discuss things with me. No one, therefore, should believe anything said about me. People should go by only what I myself say.
 There was no need to ask the Zamorin before fixing the 2nd as the date; he himself had wired suggesting postponement of Kela- ppan’s fast. I fixed the date that seemed to be the most suitable.

  	I wrote to you some letters in the course of the week. This one is 	in reply to your weekly letter.  	I have decided to obey your order forbidding me to show your letters 	to Chhaganlal. Of course I had to show him your order. I think you, 	too, would not wish that he should remain ignorant of what you wrote 	about him. I showed him the relevant part of the letter and asked 	him not to read the rest. All the same, I did not like your order. 	Why should any person in the Ashram hide anything from another 	inmate?  	I can understand a child or a grown-up who knows no better feeling 	thus. But what can you have to hide from anybody? The fact that 	others read your letters doesn’t lessen, but rather increases, the 	sanctity of your letters. You should not at all feel embarrassed if 	the    
 whole world knows your thoughts. We have no right to think any thoughts which others may not know. If we follow this as a fixed rule in our life, we automatically learn to control our thoughts. Every human being is God’s representative on the earth. He knows all our thoughts, but we do not know that He does, because we do not see Him face to face. If, however, we look upon human beings as God’s representatives on the earth, we should not mind others knowing our thoughts. Moreover, since we see a representative bodily, it becomes easy for us to acquire control over our thoughts. I wish that you should voluntarily withdraw your order. I had hoped that I would be able to write with my right hand, but I see that I ought not to use it and, therefore, I shall not perhaps be able to write all that I wished to say. I don’t mind your writing about Ramabehn whatever comes to your mind. She does know indeed that you will write nothing out of ill-will for her. So you may write anything you may wish to. I will carry out any suggestion you may make.

325,"December 	19, 1932",LETTER TO R. B. TALEGAONKAR,"
          DEAR 	FRIEND,       December 	19, 1932 
 Here 	are answers to the questions you leftlibtech_413_footnotelibtech_414_footnotewith 	me:     The 				reformer has 				to convert 				the people 				by patience, 				gentleness and purity 				of character. 				My fast 				can only 				prepare the 				ground for 				the reformer’s 				work and make the 				reformer also 				more active than 				before in 				the execution 				of his mission.  I would just as soon fast in respect of Dakornath Templelibtech_415_footnotelibtech_416_footnoteas Guruvayur if 				the call 				came. I had 				no notion 				that I 				should have 				to contemplate 				a fast 				regarding Guruvayur, as 				everyone knows it 				came to 				me; but it 				would be 				wrong on 				my part to 				tack on other 				temples. 				Nevertheless, there 				are many 				other ways in which 				the movement 				for opening 				other temples is 				being, and 				should be, 				carried on.  If 				I refuse to 				be party to 				conditional 				temple-entry by 				Harijans, it 				is not because 				I feel 				less for the cow, but because 				it is the 				best way 				of weaning 				Harijans from taking beef. In 				matters of 				religion, there 				should be no 				bargaining. Every 				Harijan knows that one 				of the 				essential conditions 				of being 				a good 				Hindu is to abstain 				from taking 				beef or 				carrion. Therefore my 				formula is 				that those Harijans 				who are 				in the 				habit of taking 				beef or 				carrion should be 				induced to 				give it 				up, irrespective of 				whether the 				temples are 				opened to 				them or 				not, purely 				on the 				ground that 				beef and carrion-eating 				is prohibited 				in Hinduism. 				Similarly temples 				should be opened 				unconditionally. Even 				as it is the 				duty of Harijans 				to abstain 				from beef and 				carrion without 				asking for 				or receiving 				any consideration 				therefor, so 				is it the duty of 				caste Hindus, 				irrespective of 				consideration, to 				throw open the 				doors of 				tem- ples 				to Harijans 				without claiming any 				consideration. Even 				today there is 				no inquisition held 				as to the 				Hindu practice 				of temple-goers. 				Very properly 				it is taken 				for granted 				that temple-goers 				conform to the 				rules applicable 				to them 				regarding 				temple-entry. So 				must we expect 				Harijans to do.  There 				are many courses 				that we 				can adopt 				in order 				to ensure 				success in a movement. There are some courses, however, which are        
 beyond our capacity to adopt. My release is a course which it is beyond my capacity to adopt.
    To 			seek to abolish 			untouchability amongst 			untouchables before 			caste Hindus abolish untouchability 			with reference 			to untou- 			chables is 			like an 			attempt to 			twist a 			rope of 			sand foredoomed 			to fail- ure. When caste Hindus 			really abolish 			untouchability, the 			other will 			crumble to 			pieces practically 			without an effort.  In 			my opinion, seeing 			that the society 			now formed 			is one 			to do 			penance or 			to discharge an 			obligation due 			to Harijans, 			it should 			be composed 			of penitents 			or debtors, 			but there should 			be a corres- 			ponding committee 			or society 			of creditors, 			that is Harijans, whose wishes 			should be ascertained 			from time to time.  No 			law will 			abolish untouchability 			before caste Hindus 			are ready 			to do so. 			Law can only help them 			when they need its 			assistance. But 			it can never compel them.  In 			Hinduism, and 			for that 			matter in 			every religion, every activity 			of a 			religious man 			is governed 			by his 			religion. A 			man cannot 			be religious 			that is 			guided by 			his moral 			and spiritual 			sense in 			some activities 			and not in 			others. When 			there is religion 			about a 			person, it 			pervades his 			whole being.  All  the  three  statementslibtech_417_footnoteare  not  inconsistent  with 			 one 			another, but 			they represent 			the same 			truth. Without 			Guruvayur there will 			be no Kelappan 			fasting, without Kelappan there would have been 			no inspiration 			for me 			to fast for Guruvayur.

 I was pained to see the published report of our interviewlibtech_418_footnote. I do not carry a copy of the Satyarthaprakash with me. I only said that there were several copies of it in the Ashram library. I did not ask for the books, but Mahadev did.
 When you offered your help to the temple-entry movement, I advised you not to interfere with it and you also accepted my advice. But the report suggests that I desired your help. The cause will suffer through such misrepresentations. I, therefore, consider it necessary that for the sake of truth and the cause you should  immediately publish a correction to the report. I should like you to publish it as soon as you can. A false report can never help a cause, and it cannot but harm dharma. A correction, therefore, is desirable from every point of view.

 It is true that I refused to eat eggs. Still I believe that cod-liver oil is objectionable, milk is less objectionable than cod-liver oil and unfertilized eggs are less objectionable than either. However, people have become accustomed to cod-liver oil but not to eggs, and so even unfertilized eggs are regarded as objectionable.
 In the statement: [“And if any man will sue thee at the law] and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also”,libtech_419_footnoteit is understood
 
 that the man who asks for your coat is a deserving person. But the statement also means that, if anybody tries to rob us of a thing and if it is not our duty to resist him, it would be better to let him take more than he wished. The golden rule behind this precept is that of non-possession. Nobody can practise it to perfection. If, however, wehave understood it fully, we should try to follow it more and more in our lives to the extent that we can.

        DEAR 	FRIEND,           December 	20, 1932 
  	I thank you for your letter. There are some people who will 	deliberately misrepresent me. How shall I overtake such deliberate 	misrepresentations except by trusting the truth in me to make itself 	felt in its own time? I have said repeatedly that Guruvayur was not 	my choice. It thrust itself upon me. If Dakorji had done likewise, I 	would have joyfully proclaimed a fast. I am in God’s hands like 	clay in the potter’s, and had that come my way, probably the 	public would have found me wrestling with the Gujaratis with greater 	vigour than with the Malabaris. I can throw nothing at the latter, 	because they are at such a convenient distance from me, whereas the 	Gujaratis are within  a stone’s throw. But as a proverb says, “You 	can wake up a man who  is really asleep by a simple tickle in 	hisear, but a thousand tickles will fail to wake up a man who is 	pretending to sleep.”  Yours 	sincerely,  SJT.

DEAR FRIEND,
 
 I thank you for your letter. I can only say in reply to one part of it that I have signed letters asking me to anticipate the 2nd and thus end my earthly life. I do not mind these letters. I merely state the fact.
 For the rest of your letter, I can only give you my assurance that behind every step I take, and every word that I utter, there is great and prayerful deliberation. I ask sanatani friends to give me the same liberty of thought and action as they claim for themselves. Without such mutual toleration, no reform is possible.
 I may also tell you that I am leaving no stone unturned to reach some workable compromise. But I must regretfully confess that I have failed hitherto.

Iknow this 	means a large draught of your time and energy, but you are a willing 	worker. Willing workers know to their cost how exacting I can be. 	The fact is with my dwindling physical capacity, I am hardly able to 	cope with the work day to day. Therefore, whenever I have a good 	thing suggested to me by anyone, I straightaway ask that one  to  	present it to me ready-made, so that I should have very little to do 	but to put my signature to it.

345,"December 	20, 1932",LETTER TO C. F. ANDREWS,"
          MY 	DEAR CHARLIE,           December 	20, 1932 
  	I have your letterlibtech_432_footnotelibtech_433_footnoteposted days after it was written, and I have your two 	dear cables. I was wondering whether the later developments in the 	anti-untouchability campaign including the  prospective  fast were 	thoroughly understood by you. Your wires show that you have 	understood them fully, and I am so glad, for, whereas the fast in 	connection with British decision was appreciated by many, the one 	contemplated to take place on the 2nd January next is misunderstood 	by many, and I am afraid that you might not understand it at all, 	whereas to me the necessity is clearer than when I fasted about the 	British decision. The British decision was a political issue, though 	with me it had a deeply religious significance. In the present 	instance, it is a purely religious issue. I have given many 	explanations in defence of it. All of them put together fall far 	short of what I feel about it, but what, I have no adequate language 	to express. Of course, for me per- sonally, it transcends reason, 	because I feel it to be a clear call from God. My position is that 	there is nothing just now that I am doing of my own accord. He 	guides me from moment to moment. This is a thing which you cannot 	make other people believe, and it would be quite proper for them to 	reject such testimony. That has happened before now. That which was 	claimed as the voice of God proved to be the prompting of the Devil. 	What it is in my case will be partly judged by results and partly 	after my death, never wholly in any case and at any time except by 	God. After all, the intention behind an act is the final criterion, 	and that God alone can know, not even the author of the intention.  	There is no knowing whether the fast will have to be taken on the 	2nd January. It will depend upon the legal difficulty.  	Yes, I read your book What I Owe to Christ immediately I got 	it. Both Vallabhbhai and Mahadev have glanced through it. Mahadev 	had not the time to go through it fully. The opening chapters are 	very good indeed. All the chapters are a  great help to a  	struggling  soul.     Appendix 	“Extract from Letter from C. F. Andrews”, 10-11-1932. 
 They reveal you as nothing else that you have written can do, but there was a chapter in it which as I read I criticized and I thought I had written to you about it, but evidently I have not. I should have to look at the book again in order to be able to recall the chapter and the subject. I could do so without much trouble, and if I can find a few spare moments, I will look it up and give you my criticism. I shall await copy that you promise of Gurudev’s thoughts on his reading your book.
 I hope that you got my cable already in answer to yours from Birmingham.
 I am quite clear that your presence is most useful there, and you are not to have anxiety complex if I have to fast. You at least will have no difficulty in believing that if I enter upon the fast, it would be by God’s will, and He will keep me intact if He has more service to take through this body.

 December 21, 1932
 MY DEAR GOPALA MENON,
 Since dictating my letterlibtech_440_footnotelibtech_441_footnoteyesterday, I have read a notice or manifesto by Sjt. M. K. Acharya of which he has sent me a copy. I send you both the leaflet and Sjt. Acharya’s notice. If the notice correctly sets forth the purport of the leaflet, it is disturbing, and the comments made by Sjt. Acharya are quite justified. The people of Ponnani Taluk are being asked not whether they would savemy life or let me die, but whether they, being themselves believers in temples as an integral part of Hinduism, are prepared to have the temple doors opened for the admission of Harijans. According  to  the  English notice, you have befogged the issue, and that is just  the  charge brought by sanatanists against us and especially me, as you know they say that the contemplated fast, instead of making the people decide on the rights and wrongs of temple-entry, will take their minds away from temple-entry and lead them against their wishes to give their votes any way so as to save me. If such were the result of my fast, it would be a tragedy. I should expect co-workers, therefore, to tell the people not to be affected by the fast, but to vote for or against temple-entry according to their hearts. You will now please write to me fully, first, as to the notice, and secondly, as to what has been generally done, and if you discover that people have been misled, do not hesitate to tell me so. I will have no compunction in owning the mistake, retracing my steps and postponing the fast. It would be farcical to take a
 
 referendum again if the people have been already misled by an alto- gether false issue having been presented to them. Whereas if Sjt. Acharya’s charge cannot be sustained, you will please give me chapter and verse in support of your statement and it will give  me  new strength and new hope.
 You will confer with Madhavan and Kelappan. I do not know whether Rajaji would be there, or Sadashiv Rao, at the time you receive this letter. You will please telegraph to me the substance of the reply you would make.
 Yours sincerely,

If such be the case, and if the law as it stands is admittedly 	against us, the fast has to be automatically postponed; whereas if 	the sanction is withheld or is delayed purely through want of 	popular expression of public opinion on it, the fast has to go on 	till public opinion is sufficiently mobilized, if it can be, so as 	to secure Viceregal sanction. If public opinion is against such 	legislation the fast must stand adjourned. I would like you 	therefore to instruct me on the law.

         DEAR 	FRIEND,           December 	21, 1932 
  	I have your letter for which I thank you. The letter contains so 	many innuendoes and imputations. It is very difficult  for  me  to 	answer them all. I can only say generally that the statements you 	make are inconsistent with the facts as I know them. Naturally the 	arguments based upon misstatements must be unconvincing. My own 	position has been abundantly clear in the statements that have 	appeared in the Press. If you had asked me a series of questions to 	ascertain first of all from me the position, I would gladly have 	responded, and you could then have built your case against me. I can 	only give you my assu- 
 rance that I consider myself to be a humble follower of Hinduism constantly seeking to act according to its dictates.
 In one thing I can heartily be with you with my whole heart. You are entirely right in saying that you and the members of the Sanatan Hindu Sabha will not be deterred from what you believe to be the right course by any fast of mine. My fast was never conceived with the purpose of influencing your decision, and for that matter any decision. My fast is intended to stir Hindus to action, and that, I am glad to say, is happening day after day, although the fast has yet to start.

     BHAI 	KIRCHAND,  December 	21, 1932 
  	I got your letter, and also both the pamphlets. You probably know 	that we are at present four kept together in this jail. When your 	pamphlet was read, it seemed to be an occasion either for tears or 	laughter. Ordinarily, I do not read the letters but they are read 	out to me. But it happened by chance that I started reading your 	pamphlet, and at the very first sentence, since I could not weep as 	I have now grown stone-hearted, I burst out into laughter and went 	on laughing to the end. But it was a matter for tears, not for 	laughter. The language is not in the least that of non-violence. It 	is not civil either. You are under the vow to remain absolutely 	peaceful and non-violent. You have made no effort at all in your 	pamphlet to win over the sanatani friends with love. Every 	word of it is likely to make them angry. You have invited them to 	belabour you. Your language is theatrical. It will not teach the 	youths the lesson either of peace or of civility, let alone truth. 	And there is no limit to self-praise. However, what I fear is that  	I am not likely to succeed in explaining to people my ideas. How can 	people change all at once if they are accustomed to using such 	language? I 	hope you got my reply to your previous letter. You must have 
 seen that my advice had been quite the opposite to what has actually happened. If, however, you did want to hold a meeting, you could have done so without issuing violent pamphlets. Your duty was, before doing that, to see some reasonable sanatanists, or, if you did not find any, to seek the help of the State and hold the meeting if you got it. If you had not held the meeting, you would not have failed to serve the cause of Harijans. I see no victory in the fact that the sanatanists did not come to the meeting to break it up. They must have felt very angry, but they may have got frightened by the strength of your numbers. These things betoken violence on your part. Your variety of non-violence puts my non-violence to shame, and I learn some truth even from the poisonous writings of the sanatanists. This is not the way to save dharma, and it is with that end in view that we try to serve Harijans. What more shall I say?

357,"December 21, 1932",LETTER TO NANALAL K. JASANI,"
        
 December 21, 1932
 BHAISHRI NANALAL,
 I had a long and frank discussion today with Chhaganlal and Maganlal. Now you, Ratubhai and the two brothers should sit together and discuss the matter. I have of course advised that Manilal also should be present. But the brothers seemed to be rather lukewarm about it, though they said that Manilal did not wish it. When I explained to them the implication of that statement, they said that they would include him, if necessary. My advice, which they seemed to accept, was as follows: Doctor’s will should be fully respected as far as practicable, that is, the sisters’ shares should be paid to them, though it would not matter if that cannot be done just now. It will be enough if their shares are credited to their names and they are paid interest at market rate. As for Ratilal, Doctor’s wish should be respected. If, on dividing the property into three parts, Ratilal’s share comes to more than  thatlibtech_445_footnotelibtech_446_footnote,  the  excess  should   be   credited   to   his   account.   As  for Manekbai, it is probable that the interest on the sum intended for her
 
 by Doctor will not be enough to meet her needs, and hence a monthly allowance should be fixed for her and arrangements should be made so that she gets it regularly. If, however, she insists on taking the amount intended by Doctor, it should be decided to pay it to her and she would then get nothing more. The sums which she has drawn after Doctor’s death should be deducted from that amount. The three brothers’ shares should be divided, Trustees should be appointed for Ratilal and his running expense allowance should be fixed. As for the other two brothers, they may, in mutual consultation, take whichever part of the business each likes. If this is not acceptable to them, the diamonds and the farms also should be divided into two shares and the whole management should be in the hands of  Trustees  or Manager, and, as in the case of the mother, a monthly allowance should be fixed for them and the brothers should not exceed it. For the present, they should not interfere with the work of the Trustees or the Manager. When both have acquired sufficient reputation in business circles, they may take over the management if they wish but they should not interfere with it as long as the business has not been started again and put in order. For the present, Chhaganlal should stay at Rajkot or elsewhere in India, and for their education the children should be admitted in the National School at Rajkot or elsewhere. I have heard that Chhaganlal is addicted to a vice. He confesses that it was so, but I believe that he is still addicted to it. In their talk with me, both the brothers adopted a reasonable attitude. If they adopt a similar attitude in their discussion with you, you will be able to decide the matter in a few hours. After this has been settled, you may send for Prabhashankar, and also for Champa, if you wish. It is likely that Ratilal will get upset if Champa is called. If possible, therefore, you should settle the matter without calling her. I consider it essential that the whole matter should be settled before the 2nd. If it  seems necessary to you to discuss the matter with me, you may leave your work and come any time you wish. I assume that all of you, or those of you for whom it is considered necessary, will come to me with the decision that is finally arrived at.
 As for the amount to be paid to the Ashram, my advice is this. If any balance is left after paying the other contributions from the funds in the Trust, the Ashram may be given its full amount or whatever is left. It may be given nothing if there is no balance. All the other contributions which are usually paid should be fully paid. If the sum reserved does not bring enough income for this purpose, there should
 be a proportionate reduction from the amounts of those contributions. I understand that Rs. 800-900 are being paid every month. Maganlal believes that after deduction for taxes, etc., the net income does not exceed Rs. 500.
 If that is so, the Ashram will get between Rs. 100 and 200. It seems that the receipts are enough to pay the other contributions. I do not think I have left out anything. You may certainly ask me about anything, if you wish.
 Show this letter to Ratubhai, as it is intended for both of you.

 I got your weekly mail. Prema left the hospital much too soon. And she was also very hasty in resuming work immediately on return- ing to the Ashram. If she does not become careful even now, I think she will suffer very much and will be unable to do the service which she is so impatient to do. Read the accompanying letter to Madhavlal [Shah]libtech_447_footnoteand apply to Prema every sentence of what I have said in it about the difference between what one loves and what is for one’s good.

  	Your usual letter came in at the usual time but as yet without the 	notes from the book you are reading. For the first time perhaps I 	found your letter mutilated. Was it a reminder that you and I were 	prisoners? But I do not mind nor will you. Blessed are they that ex- 	pect nothing.  	You say our fears are not due to want of faith in God but want of 	faith in self.libtech_453_footnotelibtech_454_footnoteBut these are one and the same thing. Want of faith in 	self comes from want of faith in God. It betrays ignorance of what 	God is. Then again you say want of  faith  comes  from  our  want of 	self-restraint. This is true but it connotes the same  thing. Read 	the verse 59 of Ch. II, Gita. Objects of senses are 	eradicated only by seeing God face to face, in other words by faith 	in God. To have complete faith in God is to see Him. Nor is the 	matter any better by assuming the existence of the fourth dimension. 	It ultimately     
 points to the same thing, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all else will be added unto you.”libtech_455_footnoteWhen we meet Him, we will dance in the joy of His Presence and there will be neither fear of snakes nor of the death of dear ones. For there is no death and no snake-bites in His Presence. The fact is that the most living faith, too, falls short of the perfect. Hence there is no such thing as complete absence of fear for the embodied, i.e., imprisoned soul. The possession of the body is a limitation. It is a wall of separation. We can therefore but try to shed our fear, i.e., increase our faith.
 My weight is now 103_ lb. I have just now eliminated bread and even vegetable and therefore also salt. The quantity of milk is slightly less than 2 lb. Under heavy strain of work milk and fruit is my diet. Ba and Bal are here. Jamnalalji is getting better. He is adding to his weight.

    DEAR 	FRIEND,  	I thank you for your letter. The way you have put the subject in 	your letter there is very little for me to disagree with. 	Untouchability      
 of a type is not only to be found in our Shastras but is universal. But that is untouchability not attaching to birth but to work or occupation. Such untouchability can only be temporary and is always easily curable. If you can make other sanatani friends take that view and admit that in practice we have gone far beyond the Shastras and further that in so doing we have sinned against our religion, the so-called untouchables and humanity, I think that a middle course can be found without any difficulty regarding temple-entry. I have no desire whatsoever to do violence to the scruples of any sanatanists. So far as the contemplated fast is concerned, I again agree with you that fast from a religious standpoint can only be a spiritual act and can, therefore, never be exploited for secular or selfish ends. As I have told you, I believe my fast to be spiritual, both in intention and end; intention is to purify Hinduism and end is to secure religious justice for those of the Hindus who have been hitherto denied that justice.
 Yours sincerely,

         DEAR 	FRIEND,           December 	22, 1932 
  	I thank you for your letterlibtech_461_footnotelibtech_462_footnote. I do not regard the Pulayas and the others as 	aborigines, and so far as I am aware Hinduism regards them as 	Hindus. That in spite of their being Hindus, they seem tobe a class 	apart is the tragedy of Hinduism. You will not quote school- 	histories or any historical text-books in order to show that they 	are not Hindus but please understand the formula under which the 	temple- entry movement is being conducted. It is the caste Hindus 	who have to do an act of reparation by throwing open the doors of 	Hindu temples to those who are regarded as untouchables though still 	part of Hindu society. If Pulayas are not Hindus they will never 	enter Hindu temples. I quite agree with you that what is needed is a 	change of heart on the part of caste Hindus. Temple-entry would be 	one of the signs of that change of heart. If, as you say, it is 	quite possible that “these reformers care little for religion and 	temples”, might it not be said with a little more truth that it is 	equally possible that these reformers do care for Hindu religion and 	temples? Seeing that they are working for temple-entry, is not the 	presumption in their favour till the con- trary is proved? It would 	be proper to say that those who take no part in the movement, either 	for or against, care little for religion and temples. If the 	reformers take up the attitude of touch-me-not in their daily life 	whilst they advocate temple-entry, their advocacy is certainly 	hypocritical. But there again the evidence is contrary to what you    
 think to be the attitude of “many a present-day reformer”. Believe me that I would not risk my life “for achieving a sham”. On the con- trary I am trying to achieve on behalf of Harijans a most subs-tantial thing from a religious standpoint.

ANSARI,  	I am so glad you were able to send me that long letter of 1st 	instant. We were all looking forward to a detailed letter from you. 	Sherwani must have already left for India. Western medicine and 	surgery seem to be becoming a very complicated and costly affair. 	The fewest men and women can get the whole benefit of it. It seems 	to me that there must be something radically wrong in the system, 	which daily tends to become more and more costly, and split into 	compart- ments, each one of which requires a specialist and a change 	from one 
 expert to another. I suppose you have a complete and conclusive answer to my objection. I have stated it in order to coax you. You may give me your considered answer when you have ample leisure. Anyway, I do not want you to return to India till you are completely restored, and now that you are there, I do not care if you have to go to  a hundred experts to have all the parts of the body fully restored.
 It is a great thing for you to have hardened your heart and resisted all temptations to attend public functions and meetings.
 Of course I knew your devotion to your profession and I am glad that you will soon complete an original treatise on rejuvenation. We all wish you success in your work.
 Please remember me to Shwaib and Shaukat Ali if the latter is there. Zohra and I correspond with each other regularly. You may discount her abilities as a teacher. For me she is an ideal teacher. She takes great pains over correcting my Urdu, and her handwriting has never been excelled by a single correspondent of mine in Urdu. I look forward to her weekly letter. I like her composition also but as to that, I can be no judge. Love from us all.

I am quite sure that Motibabu would not consciously be party to any sham, nor would  he  say anything to hurt anybody. Motibabu himself is a veteran reformer.

His idea  of  drawing sana-tanists to the reform was itself, you will agree, quite laudable. He has come here not to thwart or endanger the progress of reform, but to advance it.

 MY DEAR WHITE BEARD,
 I was waiting for your letter after your tour in Kathiawar. There is the negative satisfaction that if you hadn’t gone, not even Rs. 17 would have been collected. To collect money in Kathiawar in these times of general depression for anti-untouchability work is like drawing a live tooth. I am glad however that the tour was successful from the health point of view. You were in need of a change from the humdrum of domestic life. You cannot be happy till you have got some service to do, and I know that nothing delights you more than serving those who are at the bottom. Do I not remember vividly your beaming face, when, years ago, we went to the Harijan quarters in Godhra and held the real reform meeting there? I had a letter from Hamida before I got yours. I sent her a reply which I hope she received.
 Please send me as early as you can a description of the rowdy Wadhwan meeting. Were they really out even to assault you? What did the wreckers actually do? I have accounts which make one’s hair stand on end. Were the rowdies quite so bad as all that? I should have
 thought that your glowing silvery beard would sweep all rowdyism before it.

 December 23, 1932
 Why do you think that my fast was due to disappointment? On the contrary it sprang from hope eternal. Fasting is as necessary for life as eating. It is a necessary part of prayer. We serve as well by dying as by living. But it is the privilege of the few to have to fast. Needless to say I write of spiritual fasts. I know that fasting may come also from despair. Then it is rank suicide. I should defend my fast against such a charge. For me it has always been a process of penance and purification. The fast of 1921 was not born of despair. The basis of all penitential fasts has always been faith in mankind, God and oneself. It gives an inward joy that sustains one. I therefore want you to share with me the joy of it. I hope you have understood my argument. Of course you know that there is no certainty about the 2nd January fast. It may have to be postponed.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I thank you for your letter. If removal of untouchability is a necessary act, all the sufferings you describe have got to be under- gone. Undoubtedly the movement has to be handled gently. No needless irritation should be caused to the opponents of the reform. But it is likely that in spite of all the precautions that may be taken to avoid wounding the feelings of the orthodox, some shock to ortho- doxy may be inevitable. That is the price that every reform has  exacted.
 Yours sincerely,

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I thank you for your two letters of the 15thlibtech_485_footnoteand 19thlibtech_486_footnoteinstant, respectively. I am sorry that I have no access to the literature refer-red
 
 Hinduism you believe in . . . mention any religious authority quoting chapter and verse wherein it is said that an untouchable can enter a temple? According to the Agama Shastras if an untouchable enters a temple, pollution is caused to idol and purificatory rites should be done to remove it.       Do you believe in caste distinction
 as a  fundamental tenet of Hinduism?	I  shall thank you to favour me with  clear
 and convincing answers to the above categorically. Lastly allow us to make this fervent appeal.	The underlying principle of your action is love towards huma-
 to by you,libtech_487_footnoteand even if I had, I would not find the time to study it, nor is it necessary, because of the way I look at the whole question.
 Whilst I believe in all the Hindu Shastras as such, I am guided by one supreme canon of interpretation provided in the Shastras them- selves. It is this. Every rule and every interpretation thereof that is inconsistent with truth or morality (one and the same thing) is to be rejected. Without some such canon in the midst of a multitude of texts and interpretations a man in the street would feel utterly helpless. As a firm believer in the necessity of temples, I have held the opinion that public temples, except when they are designed for only particular sects, should be open to all Hindus and therefore to Harijans. If your application of the law of karma was to hold good, sacrifice becomes a meaningless term and help given by one person to another a purely criminal act. If an untouchable, assuming that he is so by reason of his past actions, may not be helped out of his degraded position, why should other people suffering from distress be helped? And since I deny divine authority for rules that are inconsistent with truth, I easily come to the conclusion that the disabilities that Harijans are labouring under were imposed upon them by caste Hindus. Hence I regard the latter as debtors.
 You ask whether I believe in castes. My answer is “No”, but I do believe in varnashrama—a totally different institution from the modern castes.
 Yours sincerely,

 nity and it is the sanatanists who will more truly realize its force and in practice do
 material good to the Harijans than the present social reformers. It is the imbedded religious instinct in a man that more prompts him to do good for a fellow-being and deters him from doing injury to another. No man however high, nor any man-made laws can keep an individual’s action in the path of righteousness as the call of religion can do” (S.N. 18745).

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letterlibtech_488_footnoteof  16th  instant.  I  have  since  heard  from co-workers and I find that every precaution that should be legiti- mately taken was taken in order to ensure voting on the part of those who are bona-fide temple-goers. Thus, the question was how to distin- guish the bona-fide temple-goers from the non-believers in temple going. I accept Sjt. Rajagopalachari’s statement that it was not possi- ble to have “an inquisition or a confession of faith”. When the refe- rendum is completed and the whole report is before me, I should be better able to estimate the value of the referendum. After all, the refe- rendum by itself is not going to decide the Guruvayur temple- entry question, but it would be a material factor in helping me to decide whether the contemplated fast is to be taken or postponed.

Where the villagers are so cruel as to threaten complete boycott of untouchables who would make use of public wells or tanks, the ideal course for Harijans would be to vacate such a village. Boycott of workers is a simpler matter. They should have the courage to brave all the risks attendant upon working for the reform. If they continue their service without retaliation, the opposition will die out. The other way of course is to await the conversion of the villagers.

 DEAR MAJOR BHANDARI,
 Mahadev has told me all about what you felt over yesterday’s gathering. I tried my utmost to keep the numbers inside of 25, but it was impossible to prevent the Shastris who had come from surroun- ding districts and they belonged to the sanatanist school and therefore  I had to walk warily. I had hoped that today would be the last day but  I find that I have to prolong the period. They are coming on Monday. It taxed all my strength and tact to keep the number inside of 25 as I had promised. I shall try to keep it at that on Monday also and thereafter. But I can make no promise. I am fully aware that you have to act under instructions. But they should not be inconsistent with the orderslibtech_492_footnotelibtech_493_footnoteof the Government of   India.  According  to  my  reading  of those orders, the number of visitors has been left open, to be regulated by me. I have been endeavouring to the utmost of my ability to suit your convenience both as to number and time, but occasions arise when it is impossible for me to restrict the number as you would wish. If therefore it is necessary for you to refer the matter to higher autho- rity, you will please do so and receive instructions as to the meeting on Monday and thereafter. As the 2nd of January approaches, I know that the pressure is bound to increase. I would therefore like a fairly free hand leaving me always to realize that I am a prisoner and therefore may not arrange things as if I have no restrictions to submit to. But I would like you and the Government to feel with me that I can consult the convenience of the administration only so far as not to inter-fere with the progress of the movement in furtherance of which extraordinary facilities have been given to me.

I do not know how to put some check on her in regard to what she writes in her letters. One way is that you should stop sending me letters written by her in excite- ment. The last letter contained nothing but bitter criticism of Chhaganlal.libtech_495_footnoteI would never keep such a letter from him, and so I read out to him the whole of it.

 DEAR SATISBABU,
 I have your letter for which I have been waiting all this time. I hope you have passed on the result of your examination of the Kir- loskar Wheel to  Shankarlal.  I  have  already  toldlibtech_496_footnoteyou  what  passed between Dr. Bidhan and myself. I saw that, contrary to expectations, he resented what he regarded as my interference. I therefore unhesi-
 
 tatingly withdrew my letter and apologized.libtech_497_footnoteThat was the only thing open to me to do. I had no business to interfere except on the assum- ption that anything I said would be welcomed as a friendly sugges- tion. When therefore it was not, I had to tender apology and with- draw. You will now do exactly as your conscience leads you. Let me not guide you in such a delicate matter from this distance.
 I do not mind the uttermost renunciation from you, but it must be from perfect assimilation, and the test of assimilation would be that it would give you perennial joy, there would be not a trace of anxiety in your face, and therefore in your mind. What is more, Hemprabha should go with you heart and soul and the result of such life should be freedom from illness. With you two, illness cannot be the result of dietetic error. It can only be the result of unconscious anxiety, if not even conscious. Mental worry and anxiety are as responsible  for human illnesses as wrong air, wrong water, and wrong diet; but a life of natural, joyful renunciation has been known even to overcome compulsory limitations about air, water and food. Men of God have been found in utter destitution, in swamps with pestilential air, dirty water and wretched food to sustain them, and yet they have kept their health for prolonged periods and carried on their work. It is related of Mahomed that when a disciple questioned him about his own pro- longed fasts and his prohibition to his followers against under-taking more than the regulation fasts, he said he was fed by God when he was fasting and therefore did not even know the privation, but such was not the case with the followers. Whether the tradition has a historical basis or not, what has been related is a permanent truth, verifiable by anybody, subject of course to the conditions laid down. Not having the capacity myself for such uttermost renunciation and being still dependent upon pure air, pure water and suitable food for retaining my health, I am incompetent to advise you. I can therefore only warn you against a hasty leap in the dark. I take it that you will not refuse monetary help if it comes in due course and without door-to-door begging. Will it not be wise of Hemprabha to do what was done for you, to come down to Poona and take rest, if necessary, for full one month if the climate is found suitable for her consti-tution? I dread the prospect of her developing beriberi. Let her not give up writing to me because you are there.
With love,
 Yours sincerely,

From 	a microfilm: S.N. 18814         December 	25, 1932  DEAR 	FRIEND,  	I thank you for your long letter. You are at liberty to publish your 	own letter and this reply. In 	the first place, it seems to me that you have misconstrued the     
 proposed Bill. It is not sought to impose the views of a minority on the majority, but it is sought to restore the condition as it was before the decisions of Courts gave a permanent legal effect to a custom. Whilst a particular custom is in vogue without at any stage being made permanent by decisions of a Court or by legislation, it becomes stagnant and is not liable to the gradual and imperceptible change that every healthy custom undergoes in process of time and  under pressure of the demand of the public governed by that particular custom. The proposed Bill will so alter the Court-made Law as to make it possible for the public interested by a majority to change the then existing custom. Instances are not wanting in Hinduism to prove that even the interpretations of accepted Shastras have suffered evolu- tion, so much so that in some cases the original meaning has compl- etely gone into disuse. All the fears that you have described in your letter are in my opinion groundless for the reason I have stated.
 You will admit that there are rival schools of interpretation of the Agamas, as also there are Shastris who question the authenticity of certain Agamas. If Hinduism was not in a decaying condition, we would not find those versed in Vedic lore supine, whilst gross supers- tition is defiling a religion that was once pure and had inherent capa- city for continually throwing out impurities and responding to the call of the age. I can only give you my assurance that I have no desire whatsoever to do violence to Hindu public feeling or to ignore the Shastras on which Hinduism is based. I have, however, reserved to myself the right to determine according to my light the choice of interpretation in the midst of a variety, or even in all humility to give a new interpretation where in rare instances I feel the capacity for it, and this practice is quite consistent with the spirit of Hinduism. We would not have a variety of interpretations and make them acceptable to a large number of Hindus, not always ignorant of Shastras.
 You say that whenever an idol is polluted, all that is needed to restore its purity is to do so by authorized purification.libtech_501_footnoteSince there is no method of guarding an idol against pollution by the surreptitious entry of an untouchable or others who are prohibited from entering a particular temple, and since there is no infallible method of detecting intruders before they come within the pollution distance, does it not follow that the ceremony of purification has to be gone through every day in order to retain the efficacy of the idol?
 
 Again, how would you guard against the so-called  un- touchables declining to be classed as such and insisting upon being classified as savarna Hindus at the next census? Do you contemplate courts of inquisition for determining the birth-status of tens of thou- sands of Hindus? If the Agamas, or rather the custodians of the Aga- mas, were at all alive to their trust, they would recognize the spirit of the age and draw from the very Shastras a meaning consistent with it.

  	Since we shall be soon meeting, I need not write this letter. You 	wanted my reply so that it should reach you before  Friday,  but 	because of your order [that Chhaganlal should not be permitted to    
 read your letters] I could not read your letter immediately. Since Chhaganlal cannot read it, I cannot hear it, read out to me while I pace to and fro. Afterwards I would be busy with other things. You have yourself created a difficulty both for you and me. I showed to Chha- ganlal your lengthy story of complaints against him.libtech_506_footnotelibtech_507_footnoteI am sure you did not wish that it should not be shown to him. I, at any rate, cannot be a party to that. What burning hatred, though, there was in what you wrote! Chhaganlal is altogether ignorant of those short-comings. If he had the shortcomings which you have attributed to him, he could not have lived in the Ashram. And Surendralibtech_508_footnotelibtech_509_footnote! You will hardly come across in the Ashram a man as clean as he is. I had never thought that you had in you malice enough to remember for so long what he had told you in his goodness. I love your pouring out your heart to me. But it also pains me extremely to know that you can harbour such thoughts about anyone. Your duty now is to pray to God to forgive you for this grave sin and thereby purify yourself. Do that and remove the pain in my heart.

 I got your letter. I don’t see any error in the step which you have taken. There was no such thought in my mind. I was only afraid lest my brief remarks might have been misunderstood. In fact, I my- self had advised Narandas to seek your advice. A patient is ill-equi- pped to judge the action of the physician. In any case he has no right to do so. The poet’s statement “the strong are never in the wrong” is true in all cases. I have not read the letter addressed by you, nor is it necessary to do so now. I had thought of taking some appro-priate step from here, but now I have given up the idea. I will watch the effect of your letter.

 MY DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS,
 I have your letterlibtech_522_footnotelibtech_523_footnote. The dazzle of my presence is really a greater embarrassment to me than to friends like you, and I wish that we can work and speak to one another on a par. I hate to have any special credit given to my word than would be claimed by any other person saying the same thing. With this preface I must say that I wholly dissent from your diagnosis. If I had written a similar letterlibtech_524_footnotelibtech_525_footnotesay, for instance, to you, I do not think that you would have resented it. In other words, I would not have over-rated my influence with you. How could I help Dr. Roy in securing the co-operation of Babus Suresh and Satis when I knew that such a thing was not possible unless I simply coerced them into giving mechanical co-operation, but I would not think of such co-operation even between Suresh babu and Satis- babu? Even in the Ashram, where I may be said to  have  equal influence with all, there are incompatible temperaments where  I  cannot look for co-operation, much less can I impose it; and inas- much as I believed that Suresh and Satis Babus were more effective people as plodders, I naturally desired the work to be in their hands, and I thought that Dr. Roy would appreciate my suggestion. Why should anybody feel hurt if a burden is shifted from his shoulders and put on to another, thought to be more able to carry it? And I, as it now turns out erroneously, thought that Dr. Bidhan would not misconstrue my letter, take it in good light, and contest, if he liked, the underlying assumption, but never resent the letter. And why do you say that I have rebuked Dr. Roy in my second letter? I think I have fairly put the position, but if you have not followed it, you may read it over again. I would like you to understand the motive under-lying the first letter. I shall see if I can think of a good secretary for you who will work for the love of work.

 I would warn you against issuing the English edition, unless it is properly got up and contains readable English and translations are all accurate. It would be much better to be satisfied with the Hindi edition only, than to have an indifferently edited English weekly.
 Of course, I know that there is no question of partiality, but it is as well to bear in mind how Dr. Ambedkar’s people feel about all we do.

 Women like Sharadabehn, etc., who were involved in this said that even though there was no conflict between the Harijan Labour Committee and their Committee, the scope of both these Committees was not well defined.

  	I got your letter. I liked it very much. If you show in your life 	the same freedom and frankness of heart as you do in this letter, I 	shall believe that I have succeeded in teaching you all that I 	wished to. The Bombay climate has certainly suited you. You should 	regard Gangabehn’s home in Borivli as your own. You can stay there 	if they    
 have a spare room for you. That would be the sea-coast you wanted. You should give a trial to Vijapur also. You will stay there per-
manently only if you keep good health there. There is, therefore, no
 question of being a burden on Kashi. Nor need you stay outside the Ashram for all the months of the year. You may pass ten months out- side the Ashram and build up your health, and then spend two months in the Ashram.
 If it is a wife’s duty to live with her husband, so also it is the husband’s duty to live with the wife. However, just as owing to circumstances or for the sake of duty the husband has sometimes to endure separation from his wife, she too must bear separation from him for a similar reason. Dharma does not require that a husband or a wife should always remain present by the sick-bed of  the  other partner. We can know what the duty of either is in a given case only if we know the exact circumstances. It is true, however, that the two should have equal rights. I would even go further and say that the wife has more rights as long as she regards herself as the weaker one and suffers from handicaps.
 I hope you keep better health now. Do think of going to some other place. I have already writtenlibtech_537_footnoteto you about the desirability of Purushottam going to Hajira.

Why, then, 	should another who is frying the cakes feel offended [if the former 	leaves]? However, if the work of rolling the dough is over before 	frying, it means that more girls are doing it than are necessary.  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 4086. Also C.W. 50.

    CHI. 	AMINA,  	You seem to be blaming me for what is really your fault. From whom 	did you learn this perverse rule of never yourself writing to me but 	expecting me to write to you? Those who expect letters from me 	should either write to me or fall so ill as to be unable to write. I 	hope that out of lethargy in writing to me you don’t wish to fall 	ill so as to have letters from me from time to time.  	Your studies must be progressing well. Encourage the children to 	write to me from time to time. That also will be a lesson in their 	studies. If you write, the children will copy you and write too.

448,"December 30, 1932",STATEMENT ON UNTOUCHABILITY-XIII,"
    
 December 30, 1932 I had full consultation with Mr. C. Rajagopalachari, Mr. K. Madhavan  Nair  and  Mr.  Kelappanlibtech_541_footnotelibtech_542_footnote,  who  have  come  to  Poona   to
confer with me. They have placed the results of the Guruvayur refe-
 rendum before me. The referendum was taken of the Ponnani Taluk where the temple is situated.
 Never perhaps was a referendum taken with such scrupulous care or with such scientific precision before this. Rarely to my know- ledge, have 73 per cent of the eligible voters voted.
 In order to find out the truth, voting was confined only to those who were actual temple-goers, that is to say, those who were  not entitled to enter the Guruvayur Temple and those who would not, such as the Arya Samajists, were excluded from the voters’ list. I had intended without thinking of all implications actually to find out by some method of examination, who were actual temple-goers, but I have found it to be utterly impracticable. It was enough to announce that only those should vote who believed in temple-going, who had faith in temple-worship as an integral part of the Hindu religion and who were entitled to enter the Guruvayur Temple.
 The total population entitled to the temple-entry being approxi- mately 65,000, the outside estimate of adults may be taken as 30,000. As a matter of fact, 27,465 adult men and women were actually visited for receiving their votes. Of these 55 per cent were in favour of tem- ple-entry; nine per cent against, eight per cent were neutrals, and 27 per cent abstained.
 It should be remembered that the referendum was taken amidst adverse influences. The Zamorin would not co-operate, and  I  am sorry to have to say, even cast aspersions upon the workers and the procedure they followed. The Ponnani Taluk is the stronghold of orthodoxy and yet there was a decisive majority in favour of admi- ssion of the untouchables to that shrine now made famous throughout
 
 the length and breadth of the land.
 The figures were also instructive, as showing that both men and women had no hesitation in spite of the contemplated fast, of express- ing their dissent. I would also draw a fair deduction from the neutrals and non-co-operators. They could not at all, if they had chosen to give their decision, be regarded as against the temple-entry of the Harijans. It would not be a bad or unfair guess to make, if I suggested that a fourth of these, at least, were probably for temple- entry. The percentage of the voters favouring temple-entry would then be sixty-five per cent of the total eligible voters. If they be excluded altogether from the referendum, the majority would be 77 per cent.
 Turn the figures as we may, the unchallengeable conclusion is that a decisive majority of eligible voters are in favour of the entry by the Harijans.
 That fact shows that Mr. Kelappan’s statement that the majority of temple-going population surrounding Guruvayur was in favour of temple-entry, is correct.
 In view of the official announcement that the Viceregal decision as to the sanction for the introduction in the Madras  Legislative Council of Dr. Subbaroyan’s permissive Bill with reference to the temple-entry could not possibly be announced before the 15th of January, the fast contemplated to take place on the 2nd day of the New Year will be indefinitely postponed, and in any case up to the date of the announcement of the Viceregal decision. Sjt. Kelappan concurs with this postponement. As the contemplated fast was addressed to the public, let me, at the risk of repeating what I have said previously, state my own position clearly. My fast, I regard,  as  a purely spiritual act, and therefore not capable of being fully ex- plained. But in so far as I can, I may say that it is intended to stir the public conscience.
 Hinduism teaches that when evils and corruption are beyond control by ordinary means and, human endeavour is supplemented by tapasya or penance which, in its extreme form, means fasting either conditional or unconditional.
 Therefore it is no new thing. But for the influence, supposed or real, I enjoy among the masses, perhaps no notice would be taken of it.
 My conviction is  that  Hinduism  has  fallen  from  the  purity and vitality it once had. Its very scriptures are evidence of the continu-
 ous progress and adaptability to circumstances that arose from time to time. Though it has retained unimpaired the claim to divine inspi- ration for the scriptures as a body, it did not hesitate to introduce new reforms and make  changes.  Hence  it  is  that  we  have  in  Hindu- ism not only Vedas, but all later writings claiming authority. But a time came, when this healthy growth or evolution was arrested, and instead of the written word being used as an aid to the search for light from within, it was held to be all-sufficing, whether it accorded with longings and strivings of the spirit within or not. The descendants of those who wrestled with God Himself and drew from Him some of the imperishable things one finds in Vedas and later writings, felt too exhausted for further effort, either to wring out new meaning from an old verse or mantra or produce a new mantra. They felt that they had done with God and that God had finished His work, after inspiring the last verse of the latest Shastra. And so one finds an army  of  interpreters seeking to reconcile, often irreconcilable texts, unmindful as to whether they answer the pressing needs of the age or whether they can stand the light of searching examination. And even penances took mere outward form, instead of being an expression of the inward agonizing struggle. I may be wrong in my diagnosis, but such being my case and finding the Hindu society irresponsive to the central call of Hinduism, that is, progressive realization of unity of all life, not as a philosophical doctrine but as a solid fact of life, I thought that by continuous effort to live my religion as I understood it, I had the fitness for doing penance by way of fasting and that I had such a call from within
 I hope it is easy for the reader to see that there is no coercion behind the fast thus conceived. If my fast was fixed as an unconditio- nal one, it is obvious there can be no coercion about it, for nothing that the public may do or not do could suspend my fast. Therefore, if a conditional fast is held to be coercive, it would be so considered because of the condition. My experience is that the fast has not deter- red people from sticking to their principles or even their incli-nations, as was seen at Guruvayur.
 The public will now understand that the postponement is what it means and no more. The fast was intended to secure admission of the untouchables into the Guruvayur Temple, and if its resumption is necessary in a legitimate manner to secure the opening, it will cer- tainly come, as for instance, if through the mere supineness of the
 
 reformers and consequent want of expression by public opinion in demanding the necessary legislation to remove the block created by decisions of courts and the Law of Trusts or the Madras Religious Endowments Act, which itself was a measure affecting religion, natu- rally the fast has to be resumed.
 That is to say, it must be resumed, if the original vow is to be fulfilled. The fast must be resumed for the acts of omission or commi- ssion by those who are believed to be in favour of opening the Guru- vayur Temple.
 The Yeravda Pact was entered into between the representatives of the caste Hindus and the Harijans, and while confirming the Pact at the memorable conference in Bombay, the former resolved as follows:
 This conference resolves that henceforth, amongst Hindus, no one shall be regarded as untouchable by reason of his birth and that those who have been so regarded hitherto, shall have the same rights as the other Hindus in regard to the use of public wells, public schools, public roads and other public institutions. These rights shall have statutory recognition at the first opportunity, and shall be one of the earliest Acts of the Swaraj Parliament, if they shall not have received such recognition before that time. It is further agreed that it shall be the duty of all Hindu leaders to secure, by every legitimate and peaceful means, an early removal of all social disabilities now imposed by caste Hindus upon the so-called untouchable classes, including bar in the respect of admission to temples. libtech_543_footnote
 If the distinguished caste Hindus that passed the resolution, represented, as they claim to, the Hindu portion of the Indian Nation, the claim has to be made good by increasing fraternization day by day with Harijans on the part of caste Hindus by way of opening to them public institutions.
 Mr. Kelappan’s fast over the opening of the Guruvayur Temple was actually going on whilst the Pact was emerging, and I asked him to suspend it principally at the suggestion of the Zamorin of Calicut. Moreover, as I have already said, when on the British Government’s acceptance of relevant portion of the Pact I broke the fast, I solemnly assured Dr. Ambedkar and took a vow in the secret of my heart and in the presence of God that I would hold myself as a hostage for the fulfilment of the resolution above mentioned, and the general carry-
 
 ing out of the Pact by the caste Hindus. It would be a betrayal of trust and a betrayal of the Harijans if, in any shape or form, I slac-kened my effort or gave up altogether the intention of fasting in connection with the removal of untouchability.
 I would like the voiceless and helpless Harijans to feel that thou- sands of Hindu reformers, as zealous of Hindu religion and scrip-tures on which it is based, as any Hindu calling himself a sanatanistcan be, are prepared, no less than I am, to sacrifice their lives, if need be, in an attempt to remove untouchability, root and branch.
 There can be no rest, therefore, for me or those who, by word of mouth or show of hands, silently endorsed the resolution, until untou- chabilty becomes a thing of the past It would be only out of the ashes of untouchability that Hinduism can revive, and thus be purified and become a vital and vitalizing force in the world.

449,"December 30, 1932",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
    
 December 30, 1932 As some misunderstanding has arisen about Pandit Panchanan Tarkaratna’s visit to me, it is necessary to state how he came to me,
and what happened between us.
 The Pandit came with Babu Motilal Roy, Director of the Pravartak Sangh of Bengal. Babu Motilal Roy has been tying to avoid a split among the Hindus over the campaign against untouchability and he was most anxious that Pandit Panchanan Tarkaratna should accompany him when he came to see me to discuss and understand the whole position from my standpoint When I heard that from Babu Motilal Roy, I telegraphed to him welcoming him and Pandit Pan- chanan Tarkaratna. It gave me joy, therefore, when the Pandit came to me. We had two friendly conversations, as a result of which I think we came closer together and I began to entertain hope. Though he repre- sents the ordinary orthodox sanatani attitude, he appreciated my viewpoint and he did not despair of finding a way of solving the temple-entry question. I have made a definite suggestion  to  him, which ought to satisfy the most exacting sanatanist He is now in Guru- vayur, and I hope a formula will be found acceptable to the Pro- Change and No-Change sanatanists.

 Chhaganlal’s weight has been steadily increasing. It is 115 now.

464,"January 1, 1933",464. LETTER TO THE ZAMORIN OF CALICUT,"
 January 1, 1933
 DEAR FRIEND,
 I thank you for your letterlibtech_603_footnotelibtech_604_footnoteof the 26th ultimo. Your letter has come upon me with painful surprise. In a matter that is purely religi- ous to me, as it must be to you, I should expect the uttermost frank- ness and goodwill on either side. I miss the latter in your letter under reference. Have you ever turned out an untouchable on the Krithigai Ekadasi day? Surely, if hundreds, if not thousands, of un-touchables, both men and women, enter the temple every Ekadasi, as can be proved they do, it cannot be difficult to detect some of them. The evidence in my possession goes to show that crowds of untouchables make use of the privilege every year on that holy day. You refer me to the judgment of the Madras High Court. That judgment, if I understand it rightly, shows clearly that untouchables enter the temple on the Ekadasi day, not stealthily but openly and as a matter of right.
Here is what I read in the judgment before me:
 
 The Guruvayur Temple is not a private temple, but a public temple and every Hindu has a right to worship in it, subject to such customary rules and regulations which have been prevailing from time immemorial. The high castes are allowed actual right of entry into the temple throughout the year. In that purpose they have a right of way over the roads leading to the temple and around the temple. The lower castes are allowed the right of entry only on Ekadasi Festival day, and on that day they have got the right of using the roads. On the other days they have neither of these rights. This was the situation from time immemorial.
 
 I read then from the same judgment
 The lower-caste Hindus are after all Hindus and it may be with this consideration in view that for one day in the year the temple is thrown open to them with the ostensible excuse that on such a day it would be impossible to check the crowds, the inner object being to allow all castes’ entry on that day. This was the view of Ramanuja, the famous Vaishnava reformer. According to him, all Vaishnava temples ought to be thrown open to all castes one day in the year.
 Unless I am very much mistaken, these two paragraphs seem to be conclusive evidence that for that particular Ekadasi day untoucha- bles are allowed to enter the temple without let or hindrance.
 As this matter is of great public importance, I am sending the correspondence to the Press.
 Yours sincerely,
 RAJA MANAVEDAN RAJA ZAMORIN OF CALICUT KOTTAKKAL

LETTER TO C. Y. CHINTAMANI","
 January 1, 1933
 DEAR MR. CHINTAMANI,
 I thank you for your letter. The matter of the fast is not for me wholly one of reason, because you will have no hesitation in believing me when I tell you that all such fasts have been prompted by an un- seen power. I deliberately use the expression “unseen power”, because I do not exclude the possibility of that power being evil. But these fasts have appealed to my reason as they have to that of many utterly detached friends. The silent and invisible effects of all spiritual acts are far deeper and far more pervasive than their felt and visible effects. If therefore these fasts have amounted to moral coercion in some cases, they have imperceptibly undoubtedly moved to action a thousand times more than those who have acted under moral coercion, which therefore may be regarded as a negligible quantity. That such is the result of spiritual acts is not a matter of conjecture, but provable under given conditions like any other tangible result. So much for the moral coercion.
 As to the permissibility of fasts, I quite agree with you that the motive is irrelevant if the act itself is prohibited. In the first instance, a conditional fast is not a suicide, but if we accept the authority of the Hindu Shastras, then there is ample warrant not only for conditional fasts, but even unconditional, under some extraordinary circum- stances. I have only recently found myself in possession of a pam- phlet issued by Madras Advocates in which are collected instances of fasts like mine in the Shastras. If you would care to explore the  subject, I would gladly send you my copy.
 My regards to you and Mr. Krishnaram.
 Yours sincerely,

 DEAR DR. SUBBAROYAN,
 I thank you for your letter of the 28th ultimo. All these days I have kept myself in touch with you through Sjt. Rajagopalachari. He sent me a copy of the full text of your Bill. I went through it at the time not critically. I found then that it answered the purpose. I shall apply my mind to it critically after you receive the Viceregal sanction, which, I hope, will be forthcoming without undue delay. You will see that I had anticipated your letter by announcing indefinite postpone- ment of the fast.
With my regards to you and Mrs. Subbaroyan.

     MY 	DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS,    January 	1, 1933 
  	I have your letter of 27th ultimo. I had seen the Bill. It is not 	permissive in the sense you have evidently imagined. It is 	permissive in the sense that the Bill does not declare all temples 	automatically open. But individual temples can be opened by the  	vote  of  the majority of the temple-goers, not at the will of the 	Trustees.  	I hope that your confidence about the assent will be justified by 	the event. Rajaji was here for three days, and we had long 	discussions about the Bill and the situation in Guruvayur in 	general.  	I hope the formalities about the publication of the Weeklylibtech_605_footnotehave been completed.  BAPU "

I shall send you the Gujarati translation when it is ready.  	As for the letters, they are being despatched as soon as  each  is 	ready. There was no need to make another copy of the statement. I 	shall be able to supply a copy to anyone who may want it.  	I believe that Raja, as also Ba and Shankerlal, left today for 	Bombay. Rajaji will leave for Madras by the night train today.

494,"January 2, 1933",INTERVIEW TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS OF INDIAlibtech_614_footnote,"
  
 January 2, 1933 That in a spirit of compromise he had made a suggestion in order to reconcile opposition to temple-entry by Harijans at Guruvayur, was revealed by Mr. Gandhi to
 the Associated Press this afternoon in the course of an interview.
 Gandhiji’s attention was drawn to the statementlibtech_615_footnotemade by him on Pundit Panchanan Tarkaratna’s visit to him in which he was reported to have made a definite suggestion to the Pundit which ought to satisfy the most exacting sanatanists. When invited to throw light on the suggestion, Gandhiji said:libtech_616_footnote
The suggestion I made was this: During certain hours of the day,
 the temple should be thrown open to Harijans and to other Hindus, who have no objection to the presence of Harijans, and during certain other hours it should be reserved for those who havescruples against the entry of Harijans. There should be no difficulty, whatsoever, in accepting this suggestion, seeing that in connection with the Krithikai Ekadasi festival at Guruvayur, Harijans are allowed to enter side by side with other Hindus and then the idol of the temple undergoes purification.
 Asked if his suggestion was that the temple might undergo purification daily after the entry of the Harijans, Mr. Gandhi replied:
 Personally, I am  opposed  to   purification  at  all.  But  if  that   would
 satisfy the conscience of objectors, I would personally raise no objec-
 
 Shastris were sitting around him discussing and arguing.
 tion to purification. If purification has any value, then there are so many possibilities of daily defilement from a variety of causes refer- red to in the various texts, that there should be a daily purification, whether Harijans are allowed to enter or not.
 Asked if the compromise suggested by him did not still maintain a distinction between Harijans and high-castes, Mr. Gandhi replied that the Harijans’ attitude should be this:
If there is a person who objects to my presence, I would like to
 respect his objection, so long as he (the objector) does not deprive me of the right that belongs to me. So long as I am permitted to have a legiti-mate share of the day for offering worship side by side with those who have no objection to my presence, I would be satisfied.
 Mr. Gandhi proceeded to say that in a place where the majority of people favoured temple-entry by Harijans, then the number of caste Hindus who would want the temple exclusively for them during certain hours, would be so small as to be negligible.
 Proceeding to another aspect of the temple-entry agitation, Mr. Gandhi emphatically discouraged direct action by non-Hindus for procuring  entry  for Harijans. He declared:
 This is a deeply religious movement, and it will be thousand pities if out of misplaced sympathy or other motives non-Hindus were to interfere by way of direct action.
 What prompted Mr. Gandhi to make this observation, was a letter received by him from Colombo, in which the correspondent stated that, with reference to the local temple-entry campaign, what had been misnamed satyagraha was offered by non-Hindus, consisting of a Buddhist, a Roman Catholic lady, a Christian and a few Muslims. They were prosecuted by the law at the instance of the temple trustees and convicted. The correspondent asked Mr. Gandhi whether interference by non-Hindus in order to secure temple-entry for Harijans could be justified. Mahatmaji declared:
 I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that this could not be justified under any circumstances. It would be a most dangerous interference if non-Hindus were to express their sympathy by way of direct action. Indeed, I go so far as to say that direct action can be offered [only] by those caste Hindus who are entitled to enter the temple in regard to which such action is taken, and who being entitled, believe in temple-entry.
 Asked what he had to say about Viceregal sanction for Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill, Mr. Gandhi said that he hoped that the Viceroy would give permission as early as possible.

  "
495,"January 2, 1933",INTERVIEW ON SUBBAROYAN’S BILL,"
  
 January 2, 1933
 Asked for his views on sanatanists’ agitation based on the Queen’s Pro- clamation, Gandhiji observed:
I do not know what meaning is attached to the word ‘neutrality’
 by those who are seeking to oppose Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill. I can say, with perfect confidence, that Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill is intended to undo the wrong done by the British courts’ decision. I do not suggest that the wrong was done intentionally. It should again be remembered that Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill seeks to amend the Madras Religious En- dowments Act which is itself of a religious character, another breach of neutrality according to the sanatanists’ interpretation. Again if one were to examine the contents of the Bill, dispassionately, it will be found that it seeks to impose nothing on the Hindus, but it merely seeks to register the will of the Hindu public in connection  with temples in which that public are interested—not of the whole of the Hindu public but only of those who are entitled to have a say in connection with a particular temple. I can see in this measure no in- terference whatsoever, with anybody’s religion. The Bill seeks to protect both the opponents and advocates of temple-entry.
 Gandhiji wanted the actual text of Mr. T. R. Ramachandra Aiyar’s Guruvayur speech to deal with it.
 When I drew his attention to the fact that I was prohibited by the jail warders from bringing into the jail a copy of the newspaper containing the speech, Gandhiji said that he would talk to the Superintendent and see that the Pressmen were allowed to bring in their reference papers in the future.
 Asked whether he would abandon the fast if the Viceroy gave his sanction to Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill, Gandhiji said that he would further postpone the fast till the next stage was reached. The Bill must be enacted and the Government’s final assent given for it to become law. A referendum in which the Zamorin also would have to participate, would follow. The possibility of a fast would continue till the temple was thrown open, but at every step stated above, the possibility would be reduced. The fast would be finally abandoned only when the temple was thrown open.
 Questioned what would be his attitude if the Viceroy refused his sanction to the Bill, Mahatma remarked:
Ah, if the Viceroy refused sanction, I would consider the posi-
 tion. Then, the fast is bound to come, but I should wait till the Govern-
 ment state their attitude. I do not want to go into the question at the present moment.
 Referring to the proposal of a section of South Indians for building new temples where reformers and Harijans could go for common worship, leaving the old temples to the orthodox, Gandhiji said:
 The question does not arise, until I am satisfied that those who are entitled to worship are in favour of that proposal. The orthodox view is that the sanctity of a temple would decrease if Harijans are admitted. People who are in favour of temple-entry are of the opinion that the sanctity of a temple will increase if all the Hindus are allowed inside the temple. Increase or decrease in sanctity is only a mental process. If the majority of the temple-goers are in favour of such a proposal, I shall give it consideration. But I am sure that the sugges- tion will not be acceptable to any of the reformers.

497,"January 3, 1933",STATEMENT ON UNTOCHABILITY IN HINDU SHASTRAS,"
  
 January 3, 1933 I have had the privilege, as the public knows, of having  a friendly discussion with Bhagwan Shastri Dharurkar of   Pandharpur
and others who accompanied him. These gentlemen  came,  as  they
 made it clear to me, in their personal capacity, and not as represen- tatives of any association. They came with a view to understanding my
 
 
 position regarding untouchability in general and the movement for temple-entry by Harijans in particular. No doubt they had also the intention of helping me to understand and even adopt the sanatani viewpoint, for which they were speaking.
 I had a long discussion with them. In order to leave no stone unturned in my attempt to understand the viewpoint of sanatani pun- dits and in accordance with the arrangement made with Bhagwan Shastri Dharurkar, I had invited some friends, learned in the Shastras and who, I knew, generally supported my position, so that I may have both the schools of thought playing upon my mind.
 I can say that  I  listened  to  their  arguments  and  discourses with the greatest patience and with respectful attention. I was unable to find any error in the position which I have held for period now nearing half-a-century. I know that time never runs in favour of an error, and as I regard myself as a humble seeker after truth and prone to error like any other mortal, I have always held myself ready to confess errors as soon as the conviction went home; but these dis- cussions have left me more convinced than ever that untouchability, as it is practised today in Hinduism, has no warrant in the Hindu Shas- tras. Many have done me and themselves great injustice by not giving their full value to the expression “as it is understood and practised today”. But rather than just state the effect produced on my mind by these prolonged discussions, I have secured from the pundits or  Shastris who gave me general support, their interpretation of the Shastras about untouchability, and I have pleasure in giving below an authorized translation of the statement which is in Hindi. Acharya Anandshankar Dhruva and Dr. Bhagwandas are responsible for this translation.
The statement runs as follows:
 Three kinds of untouchables are mentioned in the Hindu Dharma- shastras: (1) Persons classed as untouchables by birth, i.e., progeny of the union of a Shudra with a Brahmin woman. (2) Persons guilty of any of the five heinous sins or of certain practices condemned in Hinduism. (3) Persons whilst they are in a polluted state.
 There is nothing to show that any of the communities now classed as untouchables come under the first category. Therefore, the rules governing untouchability and ex-communication under the first head are inapplicable to them. Assuming that any of these communities can be brought under the first head, they can be free from their untouchability and have all the privileges
 enjoyed in common by the four varnas by clean living, initiation into the Shaiva or Vaishnava worship, and the like.
 The second kind of untouchability obviously cannot attach exclusively to any class or community as a whole. It may apply to individuals in any and every community. The untouchability of the untouchables so-called, is not due to their fallen state under the second head, nor can they be shown to be descendants of such fallen parents. Persons guilty of heinous sins, referred to under the second head, become fully purified by the performance of appropriate purificatory ceremonies. The progeny of such fallen persons as have not become thus purified cannot be classed as untouchables. Some Smritikaras who regard such progeny as untouchables, prescribe a very slight purificatory ceremonial for their restoration; and persons who are guilty of practices rendering them untouchable can also be free from untouchability by giving up such practices.
 The third kind of untouchability, due to one’s being in a polluted state, obtains among all classes whether regarded as untouchables or not. There is nowarrant in the Shastras for considering tanners, Bhangis and others as permanent untouchables, merely by reason of their occupation. Their untouchability is due to the external uncleanness caused by the nature of their work. All untouchability under the third head is cured by a bath and a change of clean clothes at the due time.
 Thus, it is necessary that the rights common to four varnas, e.g., of entry into temples, educational institutions, of use of public wells, ghats, tanks, rivers, etc., should equally accrue to the untouchables so called, and that it is wrong to deprive them of such common rights. This is probable from the texts, the fundamental principles and the spirit of the Dharmashastras.

 I do not need to introduce the signatories to the public, but I can say that they claim to Sjt. C. V. Vaidya. All these I hope to share with the public as early represent sanatan dharma no less than those who call themselves sanatanists. Apart from these, I have received valuable opinions in general support from Mahamahopadhyaya Pramathanath
 Tarkabhushan, Pundit Shreedhar Shastri Pathak, Krishna Thanasukh Misra and last but not least as it is possible to have them printed simul- taneously with this. I am issuing to the Press the original Hindi and authorized translations in Marathi and Gujarati, and I hope that the respective journals would only print the authorized text.
 The opinion of these learned men, popularly construed, means that no class of persons today bears the brand of permanent untou- chability. It is obvious that untouchability by birth cannot exist today in connection with a class. In connection with individuals, it is practi- cally impossible of detection. There are undoubtedly men who must be guilty of the five heinous sins, but all castes are capable of commi- tting those sins, and society today takes no notice of them. The con- demned practice under the second head refers to eating of carrion or beef. There are undoubtedly some people among those classed as untouchables who are given to this practice, but they are bound to give it up as soon as caste Hindus make the real advance. At the present moment the very incentive to give up beef or carrion is  lacking. The temporary pollution under the third head carries no condemnation with it. It is a pollution which is inevitable for all in a certain state, and the pollution ceases immediately the state ceases.
 If the signatories have correctly interpreted the Shastras, then we have been all these many years doing a grave injustice to Bhangis, tanners and others by classing them as permanent untouchables, although we recognize that their profession is as honourable as any and much more indispensable for the very existence of society than many others which do not carry the mark of untouchability  with  them.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. To me the whole of your argument tendslibtech_621_footnotelibtech_622_footnoteto show that those who have the ideas of physical purity that you have should treat themselves as untouchables rather than treat any single human being as such, and this is the well-known practice followed among the Vaishnavas. Those who follow it do not call themselves un- touchables, but they are called ‘merjadees’ libtech_623_footnote. You know the meaning of the word.
 And why so much stress upon external purity when the scrip- tures lay stress on inward purity? No doubt external purity is nece- ssary as a help to the attainment of the inner, but that can be ensured by everyone for himself.

 There is no question whatsoever of forcing sanatanists to do anything against their conviction. Private temples remain untouched by the movement. It is open to the owners to do what they liked with them. Public temples are the property of the public that is entitled to the use of these temples. Is there any force if the majority of visitors to a particular temple decide to open that temple to Harijans? The whole movement is to quicken Hindu conscience and then leave it to act according to its dictates. Can you see any flaw in this? I would like you to study the movement and its implications.
 Lastly, I must tell you that I have not found a single authority in support of untouchability as it is practised today, if you will dispassio- nately study the question and give its full meaning to the words un- derlined.

  	This is an appeal to you from a fellow sanatanist, whom you are 	trying to reject in spite of yourself. Hard swearing at me and the 	libellous charges some of you are indulging in, are proof to me of 	your distorted love. I feel like the wife whom her many husbands 	profess to reject because the poor woman cannot give equal satisfac- 	tion to all her lords and masters. But not being able to reject her, 	(they know she, the willing slave, has served them all well enough) 	they screw up all the wrath they think they have, and swear at her 	for all they are worth. The faithful wife, staunch in her loyalty, 	calmly allows    
 the storm to pass over her, for she is utterly innocent of all the charges promiscuously hurled at her. After the storm has subsided, the wife finds herself a greater favourite than before of her husbands, who laugh at their own exacting nature, and realize that their patient companion had, after all, placed her all at their disposal. Thus will it be with me, I dare to prophesy.
 There are some telling verses in a sanatan scripture. You, having brooded over the wrongs you fancy I have done to you, have put yourself in a state of rage. Those verses say: ‘Rage generates hallucination, which produces forgetfulness. The lapse of memory clouds intelligence; and failing intelligence leads to destruction.’libtech_631_footnoteIn your rage, you do not even know what you are doing. You have not even cared to inquire what I am aiming at.
 Let me put a few facts before you. The popular definition of sanatan dharma is ‘that good conduct which people can reach’. It rules out bad conduct and bad habits, however popular they may be. Religion is something that binds. Bad habits loosen, and therefore can never be religion. Therefore, if after the issues are dispassionately put before the people, they choose a particular course which is not in itself an evil, is not that sanatan dharma? Is it not the way how the body of doctrine and conduct known as sanatan dharma has grown? Is it not a condition of its growth?
 If I have taken you with me so far, then know that, in all that I am doing, there is nothing more and nothing less than that I amtrying to find out how far people will go along the road which I hold to be good and which some of the scholars, who have first-hand knowledge of divine books, tell me is also good, according to their reading of them. But you protest that their reading is bad. Very well. Let the two different readings be put before the people, and let them make their choice. If they accept my reading, will that not be sanatan dharma? You need not even then accept my reading. You may adhere to your own, but in that case you will not call that sanatan dharma. You think your reading is sanatan dharma, because you assume that a vast majority of the villagers will accept it, and you reject my claim to be a sanatanist because you think it will be unacceptable to the people if it was put to them. I have put forth no insolent claim. I have wandered amongst millions for a number of years, not as a politician, but as a man of religion. They have accepted me as such, and your own hot
 
 repudiation of me is itself a proof of your having hitherto believed me to be more a man of religion than of politics. Have you not noticed that the politician will have none of me, and has always regarded me as an intruder and unpractical visionary, whilst at religious meetings I have been instinctively welcomed? And that happened even so early as 1915, when I had the good fortune to be practically an unknown man.
 If you will but calmly examine the situation, you will discover that whether at Guruvayur or anywhere else, I am doing nothing but examining my claim and even yours by implication. My reading of sanatan dharma has forced me to the conclusion that caste-men have erred in treating a large number of Hindus as ‘untouchables’ and prohibiting them, amongst other things, from entering temples. You hold that sanatan dharma obliges you to regard these very Hindus as ‘untouchables’ and, therefore, they are unfit, under any circum- stances, to enter the temples on the same terms as yourself. I say, let temple- goers themselves make a choice of the two readings, and you throw yourself in a state of rage, because I advance such a simple pro- position. That, surely, is neither law nor common sense, nor toleration.
 I am sure you would not deny me the right you have allowed to non-Hindus, that is, of preaching their opinion so long as they do not adopt illegal, immoral or otherwise questionable methods. You call my fast a species of coercion. It ill-becomes a sanatanist to describe a simple fast as coercion for, are not the pages of religious history filled with instances of fasting, whenever dharma had been in danger? I will not insult your intelligence by citing notable illustrations in support of my statement. But even the fast is off for the time being.
 You then raise a hue and cry over a simple Bill such as Dr. Subbaroyan’s is, and shout that religion is in danger. But if you were to examine this Bill, it again seeks to do nothing more than ascertain the wish of the parties concerned and to give effect to that wish. If the British courts had not intervened at the instance of a sanatanist, if the mixed legislatures such as we now have, had not passed a measure of a religious character at the instance of Hindu legislators, this Bill would be unnecessary. So, you see, it simply seeks to remove the obstruction created under modern conditions, and not to introduce innovations in Hinduism. It is the British law, as it exists today, that makes it possible for a single individual to thwart the will of a whole host—may be even nine-thousand-nine-hundred and ninety-nine. It may suit you today, but if you will give calm consideration to it, you will come to the
 conclusion that it is a most dangerous thing both for you and for me. It is calculated to deaden religious life. Sanatan dharma, and for that matter, all dharma, must give fair play. You do not wish to play with loaded dice, as you would if this law was not altered.
 I have suggested another test for the demonstration of the spirit of fair play, if there is any in you. You will not deny that there are at least a respectable number of Hindus, if not a majority, who believe that it is consistent with the Hindu religion to admit Harijans to public temples. I have therefore suggested a solution which is incapable of improvement from the fair-play point of view. It respects every prejudice and every scruple, and so far as Guruvayur is concerned and my solution is only confined for the moment to  Guruvayur—it follows an established precedent, with but a variation. Harijans have been admitted from time immemorial, without restriction along with other Hindus to that temple for full one day in the year. There is, therefore nothing irreligious or extraordinary in my suggestion, that they should be always allowed, but only for certain hours in the day. You may say there is purification after this mixing of the two on the Ekadasi day. Repugnant as the idea is to me, if purification satisfied the scruples of the objectors, let there be a daily purification by all means.
 All the letters I have received from sanatanists have protested that behind the sanatanists’ upholding of untouchability, there is no hatred. The writers proclaim that though Harijans are children of God, equal with all others, religion demands their separation on high moral grounds, but that it should be carried out with love and not in hatred, and therefore, they should have full rights of citizenship. Let us examine this claim in the light of the existing facts.
 (1) Have you ascertained who are untouchables and why? (2) Do you know why a subtle and in my opinion  cruel social arrangement has made them landless? If one happens to possess land, he cannot make the same use of it that you can. (3) He cannot make use of the innumerable public utilities that you can; and you have provided no such separate utilities. Therefore, he might die of thirst, and you would not help him to a drink of water. (4) Careers that are open to you are tightly closed against him. (5)  Even  medical assistance and spiritual assistance are denied to him.
 If these are the fruits of love, will you not think with me that hate must be far more preferable to love? I cannot think of anything
 more bitter than the fruits I have pictured above.
 I tell you that there is nothing like this on the face of the earth, and what is worse, bearing the stamp of religion.
 I have addressed this appeal to you, which proceeds out of my soul’s agony. I ask you to share that agony and shame with me, and co-operate with me, for I have no other end to serve than to see sana- tan dharma revivified and lived in its reality in the lives of millions who at present seem to me to deny it. I am glad you are awakened, but you must now work and, instead of engaging in a perfectly fruitless quarrel with me, go through the catalogue of evils that have crept into Hinduism and make a giant effort to remove them. I call your quarrel with me a fruitless effort, because I won’t be a party to it. An English proverb has it, that it takes two to make a quarrel—happily I will not help you to make up the two.

I am glad you were able to see Dr. Ansari and other friends, and 	gladder still that you were able to have that long conversation with 	Dr. Ambedkar. Of course he has still got that over-sensitiveness and     
 terrible suspicion, but there is to me nothing unnatural in it. As I used to say so often in London, he had every excuse for the bitterness with which only he could speak whenever he spoke about untouchability or of those touchable Hindus who had anything to do with it. He has not only witnessed the inhuman wrongs done to the social pariahs of Hinduism, but in spite of all his culture, all the honours that he has received, he has, when he is in India, still to suffer many insults to which untouchables are exposed. The wonder is that he is so tolerant and forbearing as he showed himself, for instance, at the time when the Yeravda Pact was being hammered into shape. It was perfectly open to him to withstand all pressure and remain defiant, but he allowed himself to be moved by friendly pressure. He will soften if the terms of the Yeravda Pact are carried out in full by the caste Hindus, but though things are shaping well on the whole, I am experiencing newer difficulties from day to day. They do not dismay me. I was prepared for them. I knew that that little fast was not enough penance for moving to right action the great mass of Hindu humanity. Many lives might have to be given before the last remnant of untouchability is gone. But no sacrifice will be too great to remove a wrong which lies like a dead weight, not only on Hindu society, but on all who surround it. I get now and then piteous letters from Christian Indians who, being born of untouchable parents, are isolated from the rest of their fellows. Such is the contagious nature of this dreadful disease.
With our love to you and Olive,

  	You have done well in writing to me. If the analogy you have taken 	was correct, what you say will be quite true, but there is no ana- 	logy between a public temple and a private house. Public temples are 	the common property of Hindus or sects of Hindus, and members of 	those sects have a perfect right to regulate admission. All I claim 	is just that and no more, the right of the temple-goers of the 	existing temples to decide whether Harijans shall enter.  	You are wrong also in thinking that my fast was a suicide. A suicide 	is when a man does an act with the intention of ending his earthly 	existence. I never had any such intention. To my fast was atta- ched 	a condition. That you may still call it wrong is quite possible; 	only the fast could not be condemned on the ground you have 	advanced. "

 I have already explained the meaning of my fast. It cannot coerce a single sanatani Hindu who has deep convictions opposed to mine; and why do you say that I hurt the feelings of the orthodox Hindus? In this connection I would like you to study carefully my appeallibtech_637_footnoteto the sanatanists.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I must content myself with the fewest letters today. Tell all the people that I would have to write for Harijan and, therefore, they should not be surprised if I write fewer letters for some time. Any- body who has something to communicate may certainly write to me. In any case the women and the children must write. For them it is a kind of education too. Even if I do not write in reply, they should continue to write.
 After leaving school, Rambhau’s weight seems to have increased very much. That seems to have happened to Shanti and Jaikore after they left the Ashram. Try to discover the reason for this and, if you succeed, let me know it.
 Two or three correspondents have complained in their letters that stray dogs loitering in the Ashram compound find nothing to eat and, therefore, try to eat shoes, etc. If this is true, it does not mean that we should give them rotlas to eat. You should send for a cart from the pinjrapole and the dogs should be removed in it, as used to be done in the past. Probably you know that we have such an understanding with the pinjrapole. You will even find in the office the correspondence which took place on this subject.
 We should certainly think what we can do in cases like . . .’slibtech_641_footnote. If a young man who has been living in the Ashram wishes to marry, it seems to me that we cannot immediately throw him on the streets. We should be able to help them in some way. I have not thought what we can do, or whether we can do anything. The first thing to do is to consider whether we owe any duty to such persons. If we do, then we will think further and may discover some way of helping. You and other senior members may think about this and you may then let me know the view of you all.

 January 5, 1933
 SUJNA BHAISHRI,
 I got your letter. I am satisfied. I also have full confidence that you will do your best. By contribution I did not mean money. Even an unknown child who approaches you for money will get it. Don’t think I am so simple-minded as to ask you for money. For that, I would simply sign a hundi on you. I want from you a much bigger contribution than that. You can make it and I believe that you will.
 I would not use coercion even to save a cow from the hands of a butcher. I certainly don’t wish to use it to secure freedom for Harijans to enter temples, nor to make the Harijans give up beef, meat, etc.
 But the latter tell me: ‘You force us to remove dead cattle and charge us for their flesh. We, therefore, eat it and through long habit we have come to relish it. So in the first place you should not charge us for the flesh, and secondly, should make some other arrangement for the removal of the dead cattle so that we may have no opportunity to remove their flesh.’
 There is some cunning in this. They know that we cannot make any other arrangement for the removal of dead cattle in theimmediate future, and some of them wish to exploit the situation. They have a right to do so. This is what anyone would do.
 I suggest this step to the States. The carcass of a dead cattle belongs, or should be considered as belonging, to the owner of the cattle. Since he does not arrange for the proper disposal of the carcass, it means that he renounces his right over it. It, therefore, becomes the property of the State, and the State should arrange for its disposal through Harijans by paying them suitably. The State should also use every part of the body for public good. If it does not do that, for the present it may utilize only the hide. It may fix a reasonable price for the hide, and the Chamar or the Harijan concerned should pay it, deducting from it the charge for his labour. Or, if separate cash payment is fixed for labour, he may have that and hand over the hide to the State. The State should instruct its officer to see that at the time of the skinning of the carcass, the flesh and the bones which cannot be sold or utilized in any way are buried deep at a spot fixed for the purpose. This will of course show the ignorance of the State. A
 prudent State can make profitable use of the flesh and the bones. If you wish to know how this can be done, I will explain that in another letter. Just now, I have only suggested the easiest and simplest way, one which can be immediately adopted, of making the Chamars give up the practice of eating beef and carrion. At present, besides the hide and the flesh, the other parts of the carcass are not utilized at all. They can be easily utilized. But since that is not relevant to my purpose in writing this letter, I have saved your time and mine by not entering into a discussion of it.
 I hope you will be able to read my handwriting and will get my point. I am quite well.
 Why do you feel that you have grown old? Why do you believe that the body has become old, even though you continue to work? You enforce laws on others, but yourself do not obey the laws of good health. Who should punish you for that?

 January 5, 1933 In my opinion, No. What my proposal does is to respect the prejudices of a class of temple-goers who still feel that they would be
 doing something wrong in associating with Harijans at the time of entering temples, and since this reform movement is not one of com- pulsion but conversion, my proposal is intended to respect the scru- ples even of one single conscientious objector. In a matter, essen-tially of religion, so far as it is possible one would avoid carrying out the will of the majority. By this compromise, such an objector can, during certain hours of the day, offer worship as he used to, before the reforms.
 Underlying my proposal is undoubtedly the belief or  assumption that at Guruvayur (because my compromise is for the present moment confined only to Guruvayur) a large majority of caste Hindus are in favour of admission of the  Harijans  to  that  temple.
 If, when the compromise is accepted and put into practice, it is found to be otherwise, then, I admit the distinction is still maintained.
 If on the other hand the majority remain with the Harijans, then it would be a mark of generous self-restraint on the part  of the Harijans and the majority of temple-goers. If reformers are found to be in a minority, it would be a question for considerationas to whether the Harijans should take advantage of the compromise or not. After all it is the essence of compromise that it must be a half-way house between the two extreme positions without, of course, involving any surrender of principles by either party.
 In this proposed compromise, the principle on behalf of the Harijans and the reformers is that the two should offer worship on terms of equality. The period during which the worship may be  offered is not an essential part. The principle on the part of the objectors is that they cannot offer worship side by side with the Harij- ans without doing violence to their religious sense. This objection I promise to respect in its entirety, but only limit the period during which they can offer worship consistently with their objection.

 January 6, 1933
 MY DEAR MADELEINE,
 It was a great joy to receive your brief letter, especially as it recalled the precious days of communion with you all. It was like meeting members of one’s family.
 If the events at the time of the late fastlibtech_648_footnotewere a miracle, as they were, it was purely God’s work. I was but a very humble instrument in His hands. At no stage did I feel that I was doing anything. I simply could not do it, but when I said that it was God working through me, it was literally true, as far as my knowledge went.
 But I observe from your great and good brother’slibtech_649_footnotelibtech_650_footnotetelegram to Devdas that people on the Continent had not understood the contemplated second fast. I don’t wonder at it. The whole conception seems to be so new, and yet it appears to me to be the logical outcome of a prayerful search after truth. There is no prayer without fasting, and fasting which is not an integral part of prayer is mere torture of the flesh doing no good to anyone. Such fasting is an intense spiritual effort, a spiritual striving. It is a penance and a process of self-puri- fication. True fast generates a silent unseen force which may, if it is of requisite strength and purity, pervade all mankind. I have seen its unseen pervasive effect on a small scale but sufficiently large to know that it is a mighty force. It was in this instance an inevitable step in the prosecution of the campaign against untouchability. I would  have been false to myself, to my companion Kelappan and tothe cause of the Harijans, if I had faltered. At the present moment, however, it stands indefinitely postponed. Even now, perhaps, I have not made myself clear. It is difficult to do so. But I have no hesitation in saying that time will prove the correctness of the step, and in any case for me it was a call from God which I could not resist. If a further explana- tion is necessary, please do not hesitate to write to me.
 I have been tying to find out a suitable adjective for your brother. To write of him to you as ‘Mons. Rolland’ or as ‘your brother’ sounds too prosaic and distant. To describe him as simple
 
 ‘brother’ is too familiar and does not convey adequately the existing relationship. The two words that come to me are ‘rishi’ or ‘the sage’. They are almost synonymous terms but not identical in meaning. Subject therefore to his and your approval, I am going henceforth to describe him as “the Rishi’. I hope that this letter will find him in full possession of his normal health. I am afraid one dare not hope for perfect health for him. He will not give it all that chance. It would mean concentration on physical health at the expense of concentra- tion on his historical researches, and with him historical is also  spiritual, or else he would not be a rishi. Please tell the Rishi that some months ago I had for the first time his volumes on Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. The reading gave me great joy and enabled me more fully than before to get a measure of his love for India.
 Mira and I exchange weekly letters. She is quite happy in her rest house. She is studying Hindi, reading the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, and at the present moment she is reading Dr. Gour’s work on Buddhism. She is keeping her health and making dietetic exper- iments. There is no restriction about her diet. She is therefore able to get what she requires. She gets also one or two papers and whatever non-political books she may need.
 Mahadev Desai is with me. The two others you do not know personally. Love to you both from us both.

I had your two cables telling me that you were working in connection 	with the sanction for Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill. Anyway till at least 	the fate is known, the fast stands postponed. I am hoping that you 	have ceased to worry about it. There can be no anxiety about 
 anything that comes from God. Did I ever give you the rendering of a verse we have every day at the morning prayer? “Adversity is no ad- versity, nor is prosperity real prosperity. Real adversity consists in forgetting God’s omnipresence, and real prosperity consists in its constant remembrance.”libtech_651_footnoteIf then the fast comes from God, where is there the slightest cause for anxiety?
 Yes, I have had wonderful letters often from Esther, and she was enthusiastic over the news that you were to settle at least for the time being at Woodbrooke.
 I hope that improvement in your brother’s condition has continued. I shall look forward to your next letter bringing me still better news of him.
 Mira writes to me every week and has from me a weekly letter. I shall send your love to her when I write her next. I hope I shall not forget it as I do so often forget such things.

541,"January 7, 1933",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
  
 January 7, 1933
 Of late several Congressmen have been to me and told me that there is much suppressed talk among them about my action in setting up an agitation against untouchability from within the prison walls and that they do not know whether to prosecute civil disobedience or to take an active part in the campaign against untouchability. I do not wonder at the question. All I have been able to tell these questioners is this:
 ‘For me there is nothing inconsistent in my conduct. It would be foolish, if not sinful, for me if I did not use all the talents that my Master has given me, whenever I have the opportunity for their use. I have used all the talents, I have for civil disobedience. I found that I had also talents for the service of Harijans which I could use, and I am using them. In doing so I have abated nothing from my existing dharma or obligation. I have added service of the untouchables to it. I had therefore no question before me of making a choice. With those who are outside prison walls, the case, I know, is different. Those who are civil resisters have to decide whether to continue civil disobe- dience or to take up anti-untouchability work. This is a question I cannot decide for them. I am constitutionally unfit, having entered the prison gates, to guide the movement of civil disobedience in  any shape or form. And even if I thought otherwise, I must not guide it as  I have bound myself in honour not to take advantage of the conside- rable latitude given to me regarding untouchability by directly or in- directly and secretly or openly guiding the movement. Everyone therefore has to take his or her decision without reference to me.’
 Having adopted this attitude, I have refused to guide even my wife and my son. My appeal for the removal of untouchability lies to every caste Hindu, be he a Congressman or other. For the resolution of Bombay arrived at during the Fast Week pledges the honour of every Hindu to remove untouchability, so far as he or she is perso- nally concerned and to induce his or her neighbours to do likewise. The first part is a mere mental performance accompanied by personal conduct wherever corresponding action is called for. The second, that is, the propaganda part, requires everyone to make the choice between propaganda and his or her present work, where the former cannot be added to the latter.
 Congressmen who are civil resisters are undoubtedly presented with a conundrum; but that would be only if they would make the vain effort of reading my mind. I think I have made it clear that I have no mind whatsoever for them. When I decided to conduct the untouchability campaign from within the prison, I had not civil resis- ters in my mind as such, but I had the whole of Hindu society. If that whole fails to respond, civil resisters alone cannot remove the age-long evil. But a civil resister may well feel a special call for doing untouchability work, or, he or she may think that there is no disciplined resistance left in him or her, or that the spirit of resistance is played out, or even that there is no such thing as civil resistance and that all resistance is necessarily uncivil or incivil.
 It is obvious that I can offer no useful guidance in the consideration of these problems. These are all matters for those who are outside to judge. If many are filled with doubts, let them confer together and come to a decision as to the proper course to take. Those who have no doubts may be reminded of the celebrated Sanskrit verselibtech_654_footnotelibtech_655_footnotewhose   exact   equivalent   perhaps   is   to   be   found   in   the equallycelebrated English proverb, “Much wants more and loses  all”.

 DEAR BABU BHAGWANDAS,
 I cannot tell you what a joy it was to have you with me for so many days. It was all so unexpected and therefore a double pleasure.
 I got the letter you left with Mahadev. I am struggling through the book, if only for your sake, but I have no notion when I shall be able to finish it. I feel like a thief when I steal a singleminute for any other work than the untouchability business, because there hardly is a day when I have no arrears with reference to it. Therefore if you do not have anything from me about the book for some time, you will now know the reason for my silence, and if I am ever able to give you my opinion of the book, it won’t be for publication, for I may send out nothing apart from untouchability without the permission of the Government.
 Yours sincerely,

You should 	give the names of the Managing Board with their qualifications for 	bringing the scheme to a successful end. In the midst of tremend- 	ous pressure, I have just hurriedly glanced through it and noticed 	the omission. But there is something lacking about the whole thing. 	I have not been able sufficiently to concentrate my mind upon it to 	reduce to words what is lacking. A scheme has to be so framed as to 	carry conviction on the very first reading of it. This does not. 	Perhaps the business friends would immediately spot what it is that 	is worrying me.     
 As to the sanatanists’ quotations from my writings, the less said the better. Many of them are distortions, some of them are half-quo- tations, and some are so contrary to what I have written as to amount to libel. But you or any friend who would answer these things must go to the pages of Young India and verify the quotations. I could not do so, because I have no will for it, as I know what those quotations are, and if I have the will, I have not the time. The quotation you have sent me has some resemblance to the original writing.
 As regards the charges against you, I cannot understand your sensitiveness. Why do you worry if there is no truth whatsoever in those charges? You must trust to time to clear away all misunder- standings and to right every wrong conceivable. Time always runs against wrong and in favour of right.
 I have secured now pure cow ghee, and I have already begun the trial of your remedy from yesterday.

  	There is also one more thing about all this unnecessary trave- 	lling. Even the inmates of the Ashram do not show sincere love of 	simplicity. This is not only your defect. Even some of the inmates 	who have been longer in the Ashram than you are not free from it. 	Nevertheless, I do wish to explain to those who will listen to me 	that it is our duty to live as the poorest among the poor do. We 	should not spend two pice where we can do with one and we should 	take whatever risks this may involve. We should, therefore, avoid 	travelling as far as possible and renounce as many facilities and 	conveniences as we can. We should practise such strict economy not 	only in money matters but also in our activities. We should be 	miserly even in our speech and thinking. Only then shall we be able 	to follow truth and ahimsa and observe brahmacharya. Try and 	overcome this deficiency in you. Do not answer me, nor think in your 	mind, that A, B and C in the Ashram spend more than you do. The path 	of dharma is for him who chooses to follow it.  	And now for the question which you have asked. If we measure our 	children from our experience of the strength of our own passions, we 	shall never succeed in our aim. We did not have the benefit of the 	environment which, learning from our own experience, we have created 	for the children. We should have faith that it is bound to produce 	an effect on them. We need not worry if we see no such effect 	immediately. It may be that in making this experiment we shall 	sacrifice our own children. Still we should not lose faith. Our 	efforts will be rewarded with success only if we continue the 	experiment as 
 long as we do not see any error in it. The path is like the flame of the sacrificial fire and, therefore, we should offer ourselves and our children as oblation in it with a smiling face. Unless we act thus in all spheres of our activities, we shall not get a vision of perfect truth, ahimsa or brahmacharya, or we shall arrive at the conclusion that one or both of those principles are wrong. There are a good many schools of thought which regard ahimsa as a wrong ideal, and we see before our very eyes how the numbers of those who look upon brahma- charya as a sin keep growing. If, despite that, we wish todemonstrate that the ideal of brahmacharya is the right one and that those who oppose it are mistaken, we shall have to learn to sacrifice a boy like . .
 .libtech_670_footnoteand a girl like . . .libtech_671_footnoteWe cannot sacrifice the children of others. We should give that privilege to our own children. But you say that our children, too, can be regarded to have passed the test only if they remain above the waves when they are thrown into the sea of life outside. I agree with you, and that is why we have made the Ashram an arm of that sea. If we do not sink in it, we can hope to be able to swim even in the great ocean of life.

 BHAI NANALAL,
 I sent you a telegram in reply to your letter. I also waited for you, but you did not come. Firmness is necessary in dealing with Pra- bhahankar. We shall be able to manage all the others provided, the two brothers stick to the arrangement arrived at. Prabhashankar’s demand seems to be quite new to me. I am sure that the demand can never be accepted. I have not the least doubt that the  arrangements fully secured the interests of Ratilal or Champa.
 Apart from that trouble, there is another which has come today and is more serious. Bhai Khimchand has practically served a notice. It seems that Chhaganlal had sent for him. He knows that I greatly distrust him. He now writes and says that he has decided to join in the
 
 discussions and that he disagrees with the proposed arrangement. I have written to him strongly and advised him not to interfere in this affair, but there is little chance that he will listen to me. In my letter to Chhaganlal I have urged upon him not to associate with Khimchand, and have also told him that he might see me again if he is dissatisfied in any way. I have asked him also to stick to the arrangement, and I am hopeful that he will be amenable. You or Ratubhai should try and see if you can persuade him. Also see Khimchand if possible. Show this letter to Ratubhai and Maganlal, as I am not writing to them sepa- rately. Be firm in dealingwith Khimchand also. If even then some difficulties arise, we shall face them. There will be more trouble if we lose the co-operation of both. Keep me informed. Ask Maganlal also to write to me. I shall drop postcards to him and to Ratubhai if I get time.

 CHI. HEMPRABHA,
 A nice long letter from you has arrived after a long interval. Let me point out your fault which is not the one you regard as such. Your fault lies in being too greedy. “Bapu is working for the Harijans, so I must do that too.” Keep away from what Bapu has taken up and stick to what you were already doing. That too was service and consumed all your time. “Better one’s own duty, bereft of merit, than another’s well-performed.”libtech_676_footnoteYou should be satisfied with what-ever falls to your lot. Greed even for good works is to be eschewed. “Excess is to be avoided in every matter.” You can give up Harijan service even now. You wish to work for your “Bapu”, don’t you? Bapu will be fully satisfied with khadi work alone. Your attempt to do both jobs will deprive you of both as the body will be unable to stand the strain. Khadi work involves sufficient Harijan service; be content with this. You have to be above attachment. Greed is another name for attachment, this is my reading. If you do not concur, forget it. “Do as you wish.” As you always do good you can never come to grief. God is ever with you, He will never forsake you.

 DEAR SATISBABU,
 Please read my letter to Hemprabha very carefully. It probably applies to you just as well as to her. I know your passion for doing all that I am doing, but there must be a limit somewhere. If I am doing many things, the reason is that so many forces combine to enable me to handle them. Not only so, I merely seem to bedoing them. In reality, it is Truth as God working through me. In that case, you are in no way called upon to undertake all my activities unless there is a
 
 definite clear call, and if there is such a call, you will not have to force your way to the work. It will come to you; and the way will be clear in front of you. But all this is by way of caution. You will do exactly as you like.
 Now, about the Mandali. I do not like the description of the members. Instead of saying that they hold my views on religion and politics in reverence, it would be much better to state exactly  the things that they approve. A general endorsement for a large body of men and women has no value. If each were to be examined separately as to what they hold in reverence and what they will endeavour to put into practice, the answer would be different. The first sentence is all-sufficing that the members want to serve the Harijans and rouse a sense of self-respect in them. You may define the scope of service beyond rousing a sense of self-respect in them. You can say what they will exactly do, and if they are to confine their work to the service of Harijans, then it is better to say that, and nothing more. The field is vast enough to occupy several thousand workers all the hours of the day for a number of years.
 Then, again, why form any Mandali at all? You say that after all it is a branch of the Pratishthan. If that be so, it is cumbrous to have a new name and a constitution. The less pretentiousness there is, the better for the work in hand.
With love,"

    SJT. 	SATISBABU  15 COLLEGE 	SQUARE, 	CALCUTTA  From 	a photostat: G.N. 1623; also S.N. 19192         MY 	DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS,  BAPU             January 	8, 1933 
  	In reply to your letter of the 4th, I sent you  a  telegram 	yesterday. I have revived my suggestion that the English edition at 	least should be published in Poona, and it can be published, not 	simultaneously with the Hindi, but on Fridays, if the Hindi is pub- 	lished on Mondays. The English edition may then be issued under my 	supervision, and would take in as much as may be necessary from the 
 Hindi edition. All the facts and figures, reports and the like will be taken from the Hindi, and there will be original things also in it. In that case, you need not send anybody from there, if there is no one available. I fancy that I shall be able to get a local man, or more, to do the work.
 I discussed this thing with Sjt. Thakkar yesterday and he approves of the idea. I then suggested that he should discuss it with you, but he said it would cause delay and that, therefore, I should transmit my views to you by the post. If you heartily approve of the idea, you may pursue it further, and may even come down here, if you think it necessary to discuss it. For this purpose you need not delay the Hindi edition. The English may come a week or two later.

  	I have your letterlibtech_678_footnote. 	I have forwarded it to Sjt. Ghanshyamdas Birla. He can render very 	little assistance on the technical side. I do not know what he can 	do on the financial side. I 	am also writing to Sjt. Shankerlal Banker.  	It should be possible to provide you with an expert, but you won’t 	get the work that you want out of an expert sent from outside the 	Punjab; and there seems to me to be something incongruous for the 	Punjab, where hand-spinning and hand-weaving are most known, to have 	to go out in search of an expert in these matters, and he being      you 	in the 	interests of 	Harijans to 	kindly instruct the 	All-India Spinners’ 	Association to provide 	an expert 	for advising 	the spinners 	in the 	various centres as 	well as 	to make 	arrangements for 	the disposal of 	the yarn and start 	weaving operations in new 	centres” (S.N. 19155). 
 unfamiliar would find it very difficult to locate the spots  where weaving operations may be started. An outside expert will be able only to examine and test wheels, looms and their products, but from your letter I gather that you want an organizer. I do not know a better organizer than yourself. But it is high time that the Punjab produced technical experts.
 All this notwithstanding, I am sending a copy of your letter and my reply to Sjt. Shankerlal Banker and I have no doubt that he will do whatever is possible.
 I should have thought that Harijans were least affected by famines, not being themselves agriculturists.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letterlibtech_689_footnote. The practice you mention is by no means common all over India, but the remedy is surely in the hands of the householders. If they have got rid of the false notions of un- touchability, they would dismiss a careless sweeper and do sweeping themselves. He can interfere with a new man coming, but he dare not prevent the householder himself from doing his own cleaning. The evil is of our own creation and therefore we can deal with it without any difficulty.
 Yours sincerely,

569,"January 8, 1933",LETTER TO PARMANANDA K. KAPADIA,"
  
 January 8, 1933 The explanation about Guruvayur is contained in your own statement. It is literally true that the issue is an offshoot of the
withdrawal of the Cabinet decision. Ever since I came to India, I have
 been impressing on people the importance of a pledge, but I see that it is not readily accepted even by persons like you. At the time of the withdrawal of the decision, a pledge was taken in the name of the people under the leadership of a great man like Malaviyaji. Can we now forget the pledge even for a moment and still hope to win swaraj? People should now act with a greater sense of urgency for the removal of untouchability than they thought it necessary to do for the with- drawal of the decision. It would not matter if they do not succeed immediately. But the tempo of this campaign should be faster than that of the movement for the withdrawal of the decision. Why do you
 
 believe that swaraj is something apart from the eradication of untou- chability? Swaraj is not like a straight rod. It is rather like a banyan tree. The latter has innumerable branches each of which is as impor- tant for the tree as the original trunk. Feeding any of them means feeding the tree. Nobody can lay down a rule as to which of the branches should be fed when. Circumstances determine that.
 Kelappan’s mistake was a very small one. If, after having persuaded him to give up his fast, I had abandoned him, I am sure all of you would have left me in the end. Anybody who forsakes an humble co-worker at a difficult hour is a man of straw.
 ` Your other questions can be convincingly answered, but they lie outside the limits of my present freedom. If I am alive, I will explain them some other time. My fasts never spring from despair or frus- tration. They have their source in my undying optimism and intense faith. Nor are they as cheap as you think. If the last fast had not been postponed, I would have violated dharma. But I cannot explain all this fully just now. The fact is that I am making my experiment in the quest of truth along a new line altogether. New ideas, therefore, occur to me at every step—they are new even to me—and are placed before the nation. How can all of them be understood by the people immediately? And I also cannot explainthem freely. But truth does not require many words to explain it–if in fact it requires any. It has the power of spreading by itself, like the fragrance of a flower. The difference between the two is that fragrance disappears as quickly as it spreads, whereas truth continues to spread indefinitely and with even greater speed. Since we cannot measure that speed, we make the mistake of believing that truth does not spread. You should, therefore, have patience and faith and never give way to despair.

 CHI. RUKMINI,
 I got your letter. Maganlallibtech_692_footnotemust have taught you sufficiently well how to make a letter interesting. Should I now teach it all over again? A person who desires to make his letters interesting should himelf be interested in everything round him, human beings, other
 
 creatures, trees, earth and sky. He should also have an interest in writing the letter to the man or the woman to whom it is addressed. If you had such interest, you would be making new discoveries every day. You can describe your home, the street, the work which the persons whom you meet do, the members of your family, your thou- ghts, the letters which you receive, animals, birds and hundreds of things like that. Mirabehn writes to me every week, and no letter of hers is shorter than ten pages. And remember, she is in jail. Do you understand now [how to write interesting letters]?

       January 	8, 1933  BHAI 	BHAGWANJI,  	I got your letter. Though you usually write frankly, your post- card 	this time is not frank enough. You seem to believe that Manibhai is 	a bad man. If that is so, you should state it plainly. I wrotelibtech_693_footnoteto you    
 and told you that I did not know even that Manilal had complained. Do you have personal knowledge of his having complained? If you have it, your first duty as a gentleman and as a relation was to write to him. I am willing to write to him if you give me some evidence of his misdeeds. Apart from that, I don’t know what to say about your suggestion as to whom I should put up with. I do not think that I am so good a man that I should never put up with a person whom the people believe to be a bad man. I myself am a bad man, and still I live in my house. Would it be proper for me, then, if I try to sit in  judgment over others? Moreover, how can a man, who daily wanders from place to place and eats and sleeps at other people’s places, afford to be too particular about the place where he puts up. I, therefore, follow one rule, namely, to regard all strangers as my kith and kin. My own relations remain so inany case. I do not agree with the principle, if you have laid down any such for yourself, that one must not lodge a criminal complaint against one’s relations, no matter what wicked things they do, but one may do so against strangers. However that may be, I ought to tell you, as I told Khimchand some months ago, that I have not the least trust in him. You may also know that Manilal is not the cause of my distrust. It is Khimchand’s own letters one after another which have increased my distrust of him. You may see now how much worry and trouble you have created for me. And still you ask for forgiveness, but I don’t think, you expect to receive it. But you are free to do whatever you like and so are safe.

       January 	8, 1933  CHI. 	NARANDAS, I 	got your large packet.  	After reading Prema’s letter, I feel that we should get Lakshmi 	married immediately. I have written to Lakshmidas and told him that, 	if Marulia has changed his mind, he has a right to do so. I think it 	will also be good if Prema writes to him and tells him about the 	special circumstances of Lakshmi. If Marulia has changed his mind, 	we will think what to do.

How long will 	she have to take the injections?  	I had agreed with what you had written about Bhikhabhai and Balwant. 	I, therefore, did not say anything in reply. Thus the reason was not 	that I had any doubt in my mind.    
 There is still no letter regarding Amina’s children. I am expecting Pyare Ali’s letter in a day or two.libtech_695_footnote
 Please let the Muslim lady who has come from Ajmer stay there for the present. Write to Pyare Ali about her. Read out our rules to her. She may stay there as long as she is ready to observe them. Tell her that, meanwhile, we are inquiring about other places where she can stay. If there is an institution for Muslim women in Ahmedabad itself, you should try to get her admitted there. Know from her all details about her, whether or not she has been educated, where she  was  brought up, etc.
 Such cases will turn up again and again. Even if, instead of becoming what we intend it to be, the Ashram becomes only a place of refuge, we shall not lose heart. I am not sure if, by rejecting such persons who throw themselves on us, we would not be committing violence. But in taking any decision in this matter, we should  of course take into account our capacity, our rules, our aim, etc. After considering all these factors, do what you think best. There is no absolute dharma in this matter. If in the last resort we have to be guided by the principles of truth and non-violence in all that we do, we must sometimes relax the rules framed by ourselves. But the final decision will be entirely yours. Treat my opinions and sermons as so much weaving of words. You may use them only for coming to your own decisions.
 Prabhudas can leave Almora. We should draw a lesson from this, that the place can be looked after even if nobody stays there. And in any case the boys are there. I am sure the expenditure has come down now. I am glad that, while he is in his present very unsettled state of mind, he lives at Wardha. And, moreover, he will be marrying shortly. Let him, therefore, remain at Wardha so long as the expenditure is not excessive.

He may send the actual amount spent or the amount which he had promised.

 You are right. I do commit many mistakes. I get absolutely no time for reading. Letters to you and Zohra are the only [Urdu] lessons  I have. What can I do? That I do at least this much is something. Must a sick person like you attend a wedding ? Wouldn’t the wedding have taken place if you had kept away? What sort of justice is that even sick people must perforce attend weddings? Anyway, I hope you are better now. What does ‘tuk’ mean in that bhajan? Our respects to Father and Mother.

 January 9, 1933
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 You will find with this a letter from Kanhaiyalal to Ghan- shyamdasji. Do you know anything about it? If you do not, it was improper for an inmate of the Ashram to have applied for help to an outsider, particularly to a friend of the Ashram. Kanhaiyalal him-self may not have been aware of any impropriety when writing the letter, but this incident makes it necessary to warn everybody. It is assumed that those who join the Ashram do so in a spirit of renun-ciation. Hence, while they live in the Ashram, they should not seek help from outside even for their work of service. When giving such a warning to the inmates of the Ashram, it is not necessary to mention Kanhaiy- alal’s name. I am writing to him too.
 I have already writtenlibtech_705_footnoteto you suggesting that Jamna should try fenugreek seeds. A letter from Kishorelal just received gives a little more information. The discovery about the efficacy of these seeds is his own. He eats about 20-25 seeds in the morning and the same num- ber in the evening. He roasts them till they become red. He says that they may even be eaten fried in ghee. There is a possibility that they may bring about constipation. If that happens, Jamna may reduce the quantity. If 20-25 seeds have no effect, she can increase the quantity up to 50-60 grains. Kishorelal had started with that number. The
 
 asthma was cured, but he reduced the quantity because he found that the seeds had caused constipation. Jamna should first try the seeds without frying them. If necessary, she may afterwards try fried seeds.
 Mahadev tells me that this experiment is worth trying on Chim- anlal and Babu also.

 I believe in the injunctions of the Shastras, as also in custom and the practice of respected men and women. But the inner voice springs from the cumulative effect of all these. It is the moving force behind the whole world. It is no exclusive virtue or defect of mine. My inner voice may certainly be imperfect, as everybody else’s. That is why man has been regarded as the embodiment of errors.
 If there truly exists an untouchable class in the human race I am striving to be born only into that and no other.
 My whole inclination is towards a revival of the varnashrama dharma; I have no doubt about it.
 To spend thought or anything else on an irrelevant matter is against my nature.
 Devotion to Krishna is the keynote of my life; and sanatan dharma is my very life-breath. One day those who at present call themselves sanatanists will accept the truth of this avowal of mine.

 January 11, 1933
 I observe that there is a lot of misunderstanding about the compro-mise   proposallibtech_729_footnotelibtech_730_footnoteI   have    made    in    connection    with   the temple-entry question, and I see that there is dissatisfaction over it even among Harijans. That dissatisfaction is quite natural. Where inequality is ram-pant, anything that savours of it is immediately suspected and conde-mned. I have however every  faith  in  my proposal and in spite of the criticisms directed against it, I see no reason to withdraw it. If any single temple is opened according to that proposal, it would be found not only workable in practice, but that Harijans, who are now suspecting in it inequality and a surrender to orthodox opinion, will see that, while it takes that opinion into full account, it surrenders nothing of the principle, namely, that Harijans should be admitted to temples, if at all, on terms of absolute equality with the rest of the Hindus. But since there can be no compulsion in religion, prejudices, which amount to belief for those who hold them,
 
  
main
must be respected, in so far as that respect is consistent with the
 
thing. There is then needed a  formula whereby such  objectors
 
  	will not be deprived of the religious consolation to which they are 	en- titled. That can only be done if there is some period fixed 	during which they can have their darshanlibtech_731_footnotein isolation.  	However unreasonable it may appear to reformers, as it does to me, 	the sentiment undoubtedly exists that the efficacy of the idol is 	dimi-nished, if not altogether destroyed, by the presence of certain 	people in the temple in which it is installed. It is not possible to 	make the people who harbour that sentiment give it up by force of 	law or arms. That can only disappear either through an appeal to 	reason or through experience gained from those who act contrariwise, 	and yet do not suffer any misfortune which can be directly connected 	with their giving up that particular sentiment. I am sure that 	Harijans do not want to cause vio-lence to the feelings of any 	single person in their legitimate demand to vindicate their status 	in Hinduism.  	This is a period of grace. Caste Hindus are on their trial. Either 	the Resolutionlibtech_732_footnotearrived 	at last September at the meeting in Bombay has the backing of the 	general mass of the caste Hindu or it has not. If it has, the 	temples must be voluntarily flung open to Harijans and if the 	majority of the temple-goers show their desire in no unmistakable 	terms for such admission, the Resolution must be regarded as fully 	vindicated. Cent per cent assent is almost an impossibility in human 	affairs, and in a mattes of religion dissenters ought to be taken 	into consideration. My proposal does that, and nothing more. It is 	an acid test for all. The dissenters are in a minority, and sincere 	in their conviction but tolerant to their opponents. After having 	made every provision for themselves, they would make equal provision 	for their opponents. If the reformers be equally sincere and 	tolerant towards the dissenters, they will make adequate provision 	for the dissenters’ being able to offer worship according to their 	wont. If Harijans have no desire whatever to coerce anybody so long 	as they can exercise equal rights with the reformers, they should 	have nothing to complain of at all. My 	proposal is undoubtedly based on the assumption that upon     
 a referendum, a large majority of the temple-goers would vote for the admission of Harijans to temples, and that, therefore, they would visit temples only during the joint hours, and would not visit them during the time set apart for the dissenters. If, in practice, it is discovered that the reformers are a negligible quantity, they would naturally abstain from making use of such temples and if the majority of the temples show such an unfortunate minority they will rightly conclude that the Bombay Resolution has not the backing of the caste Hindus
 
 But say Harijan friends: ‘What about the purification against which you have so often written and spoken?’ Of course, I am as much against purification now as ever. If purification remains a  general law, then untouchability remains. But purification under my proposal assumes a different shape altogether. Do we not do many things in order to respect the sentiments of our friends and tolerate many more? The question before Harijans, before Hindu society and before the whole world is whether caste Hindus, as a whole, have undergone a change of heart, and whether they are ready to abolish untouchability as it is practised today. If the majority of the caste Hindus vote for its abolition, surely, it is the duty of both reformers and Harijans to accommodate the minority that may notsee eye to eye with the reformers, when their difference is based on what is to them a deep religious conviction. Mutual toleration is the law of the human family, and what my proposal has done is to rigidly enforce that principle.
 
 I would like, in one sentence, to emphasize the fact that the present campaign is one against untouchability as it is practised today in Hindu-ism, and not against untouchability which is, in some shape or form, common to mankind. Such untouchability does not attach to a person, but to his work or to his conduct. It is not sought to gain complete freedom from the laws of cleanliness and hygiene and the like, the observance of which is obligatory on every temple-goer, even at the present day. But what is insisted upon is that every Harijan who conforms to these laws is entitled to admission to all public temples on terms of equality with the rest.

 I am permitted to see Jamnalalji as often as may be necessary and to discuss untouchability matters with him. He was reading the consti-tution of the Societylibtech_734_footnoteand these are the  pertinent  things  to which he drew my attention:
 The resolution is wrong. It is not in accordance with the resolution as it was passed by the Conference. There is nothing in the resolution as it is given in the pamphlet about temple-entry. You will see the correction made in my statementlibtech_735_footnoteof the 30th December. How the incomplete resolution came to be taken I do  not  know.  The correct text appears in The Times of India of the 26th September. This point was first noticed by me, but I forgot all about it till the resolution was required for my state-ment. Then too I forgot to write to you about it. But I noted down the points that Jamnalalji brought forward, and this was the very first.
 The second is that whereas the resolutionlibtech_736_footnoteabout electorate is described as having been passed by the Conference, the resolution about the social and religious rights of Harijans is described as having been passed by a meeting of Hindus, five days later. Jamnalalji therefore says that as the text reads, it will appear as if it was a resolution passed by a meeting of Bombay Hindus only and not by representatives of all-India Hindus. If so, the Anti-untouchability League could not be established for all India by a Bombay Hindus’

 meeting.
 The third point he made was that there is nothing in the creative resolution authorizing the All-India Anti-untouchability League, as it was originally called, to alter its name.
 The fourth was that the resolution describing the powers of the League or the Society was not exhaustive enough.
 The fifth was that there was no Treasurer appointed, and that it was not clear as to who would have the control of the funds raised by provincial organizations.
 All these points deserve consideration. I could not throw much light upon them, except that I told him that you retained in your own person the Treasurership purposely in the initial stages.
 I take it that you are collecting statistics somehow or other as to the opening of temples, wells, etc., throughout India."

DEAR FRIEND,"
612,"January 11, 1933",LETTER TO T. A. V. NATHAN,"
  
 January 11, 1933
 
  	I have your letterlibtech_741_footnoteenclosing three cuttings for which I thank you. I take 	them in order of their dates. That 	of the 28th December calls for no reply.  	That of the 29th, that is, the one on the postponementlibtech_742_footnoteof the fast has led you to grant me an indulgence, 	because you have been averse to the method of the fast. But I must 	not exist on indulgences from friends, especially in religious 	matters. Fortunately for me, your indulgence is due to an oversight 	of a material condition, whose happening was to automatically 	postpone the fast, and this was some legal difficulty which could 	not be got over within the time. This difficulty came in the shape 	of the want of Viceregal sanction. If I had taken the fast on the 	2nd of January, I am afraid that you would not only have condemned  	the fast as such but you would have condemned it as coercion against 	the Government of India. So, you see that the fast is postponed, not 	because I have realized its uselessness, but because I have realized 	the sinfulness of taking it in spite of the supervening of a 	contingency that had been contemplated and provided for.  	Your last article, that is, of the 4th instant, calls for a fairly 	large reply, but I shall not attempt it, if only because I have to 	economize time just at present. I see in my proposal no surrender 	whatsoever of principle. In this campaign I have endeavoured, as 	much as a Harijan by adoption can, to put myself in his position, 	and I say to the objectors: ‘If you are polluted by my presence or 	by my touch, I am quite prepared to consent to a separate period 	being reserved for you to offer worship by yourselves. give you the 	same credit for sincerity that I claim for myself. You are as much 	entitled to worship in the temple as I think I am. Therefore you 	offer worship in your time, and  I shall offer worship, along with 	the reformers, during the period     
 reserved for us, and since by tradition you have been taught to think that the efficacy of the idol is diminished by my entering the portals of the temple gate, though I do not believe in it myself, let the priest perform the purification cere-mony.’libtech_743_footnote
 This is how I rehearsed the whole thing to myself before I made the proposal to Pandit Panchanan Tarkaratna. Of course the proposal would not be worthy of consideration if there was not a big assumption underlying it, namely, that the objectors would be in a negligible minority.
 My proposal, therefore, is an effective and acid test of the sincerity of all concerned. If the objectors including the Shastris are sincere in their protest on behalf of what they consider to be sanatana dharma, they would jump at the proposal. If the reformers and the Harijans are sincere, they should hail the proposal with joy, and if it is accepted, regard it as a vast step towards the fruition of the reform. If it is found by experience that the caste Hindus who offer worship during the joint period are themselves a negligible quantity, it would be a defeat for the reformer, and it would be a sign that the Harijans should abstain from entering those temples where they are unwelcome visitors. They would not then have to go to the temples as beggars before caste-men. They will go, if they go at all, as fellow-Hindus, welcomed by an overwhelming majority of caste-men who would not consider themselves in any way polluted by the touch of the erstwhile untouchables.
 Any other solution would be tantamount to compulsion. You will recall what I said in one of my previous statements that wherever the majority of the temple-goers are against the admission of Harijans those temples should not be visited by them, and where the majority was composed of reformers, the possession should go to them along with the Harijans and that the minority should build another temple for themselves, if they so choose; but in the course of argument with Pandit Panchanan Tarkaratna, I discovered a flaw in that proposal. It is an undoubted fact that—whether it is right or wrong is not the question—thousands of people attribute particular sanctity to their favourite temples. That sanctity is for them an untransferable thing. Sanctity handed down from ancient times cannot be imparted to a new image and a new temple by the mere will of man, and therefore the
 
 proposal I have now published dawned upon me, and the proposal to be of any value has to carry withit the consent to purification, again out of scrupulous regard for the religious sentiment of the minority.
 You will sympathize with my reasoning, even if you may not agree with it, when you realize that ahimsa is a fundamental creed with me and enforceable under every conceivable circumstance. That  I may fail miserably in reducing my creed to practice on all occasions does not detract from the creed, and is irrelevant to the discussion; and my non-violence would not permit me to do violence to the feelings of a single devotee who has been accustomed to visit a particular temple. I would also ask you to remember that, whatever may be said to the contrary, for me the whole of this campaign against untouchability is a purely religious campaign. It is a movement of a big reform in Hinduism which, as I have said so repeatedly, must die if untouchability as we know it today is not eradicated. I must also confess that I have a profound reverence for the Hindu Shastras as I have conceived them; but I cannot impose my conception upon others by force. I must let it work its way in the midst of competing interpretations and conceptions. Therefore wherever possible, my attitude would be to make provision for all other conceptions and interpretations.
 If you would bear these things in mind, you would not only understand my position but you will support me whole-heartedly, and I want your support. I want the support of every Hindu. Your paper represents I know a very large body of advanced Hindu opinion and since you are taking the trouble of trying to understand me, I am not going easily to give up the attempt to enlist your full support.
 You have asked me quite unjustly “whether he (i.e., I) would be willing to satisfy the conscience of conservative seekers in England who want that political reform in India should be postponed to some later period”. I will not insult your intelligence by showing you that there is no analogy between the position underlying your question and the position with reference to temple-entry, especially in view of what I have said in the foregoing paragraphs.
 Lastly, you cavil at the use of the word ‘Harijan, for untouch- ables. Evidently, you do not know how the word came to be used in the first instance. It was suggested by certain untouchable friends who do not like to be called ‘untouchables’, and it was suggested because
 
 a saintly poetlibtech_744_footnoteof Gujarat, according to their interpretation of one of his hymns, used it in connection with ‘untouchables’. I immediately seized upon the word as also otherwise most fitting, for the most despised people are the most favoured of God.
 I fail to see any slave mentality about the origin of the use of the word or its continuance, and let us hope that when untouchability has a decent burial, we shall all strive to become Harijans, that is, pure men of God."

  	I have now carefully read both your articles on the Gita. I 	have found them to be interesting.  	I observe that you have reached the same conclusion that I had by a 	different method. Yours is the learned way, not so mine.  Yours 	sincerely,  SJT. 	G. V. KETKAR, 	B.A., 	LL.B.

Is it not strange that you should 	write to me in English? or that you should frame questions as if you 	wanted to catch in your trap a witness who was trying to escape it? 	But, as an elder brother, you have a right to do all that, for I 	could judge from our discussionlibtech_753_footnotethat you believed me to  have  completely forsaken 	dharma. However, if God grants you a long life you will admit one 	day that I had not knowingly done so. I will now reply to your 	questions.libtech_754_footnote  Pranams from  MOHANDAS  l. 	You desire that each and every sanatanist Hindu should form and 	express his opinion on this question according to the dictates of 	his conscience. I 	would welcome it if it were possible.   Is 		it not a 		fact that there are 		thousands of 		people who 		believe that India 		cannot get real swaraj 		without you?  If 	it is so, I would regard that as a heavy responsibility on me.        
  Is 	it not a 	fact that there 	are thousands 	of people 	who value 	your life more 	than what they consider 	to be their religion? 
I would be much pained if this is true. I cannot endure anybody
giving up what he regards as his dharma in order to save my life.
  Where 	was the need 	of announcing 	your firm resolve to fast 	to death 	if the 	Guruvayur Temple was not 	opened to the untouchables? 
This I have discussed at great length in my articleslibtech_755_footnote.
 Why 	did you not issue a referendumlibtech_756_footnotewithout taking such 	a vow? 
To this too my articles contain a satisfactory reply.
 Did not the persons who were engaged in taking votes exploit your vow ? 
What you believe is not altogether improbable.
  Can 	you correctly ascertain 	the percentage 	of voters 	who voted 	in favour 	of the 	entry on account of your vow before them? 
It is impossible to reply to this without knowing what is in the
heart of the person concerned.
  If 	your case is 	strong and 	the cause you 	advocate is 	just and 	reasonable, why 	have you 	announced your vow 	to fast to 	death if 	His Excellency the 	Viceroy does not 	sanction the 	Billlibtech_757_footnotebefore him? 
 It is absolutely necessary to read my articles for a reply to this question
 Do you know that this vow is being exploited for nourishing the agitation 
 
   1932.     
  Calicut, 	a trustee of the Temple, being against temple-entry, the referendum 	was taken amidst adverse influences. Vide 	“Statement on 	Untouchability-XIII”, 30-12-1932.  
 in favour of the Bill being sanctioned?
No such thing has happened to my knowledge.
  Are 	you prepared to 	give up 	your vow 	and issue a 	fresh referendum 	in connection 	with the Guruvayur Temple? 
If    a    systematic    referendum   is   held with   the	Zamorin’s
 co-operation and if he implements the result, my pledge will have been fulfilled.
  Before 	issuing the referendum, 	did you frame 	definite rules as to who 	can rank 	as bona-fide 	worshipper of the 	deity for guidance of your men who were engaged  in 	taking votes ? 
Yes.
 12 . Who can rank as a bona fide worshipper of the deity according to you ?
 Those who, according to the present practice, are entitled to visit temples and who accept the necessity of worshipping in temples.
  Did 	the persons engaged in 	taking votes ascertain by 	inquiry which of 	the voters 	were bona-fide 	worshippers of 	the deity? 
 Due publicity was given as to who were entitled to vote and leaflets were distributed to every home, and the people were then trusted to show regard for truth.
  Can 	you say that a Hindu 	who does not visit 	a temple 	even once a 	month for 	darshan and 	who does not 	pay a single farthing as 	bhet or 	samagrilibtech_758_footnote, can 	rank as a 	bona-fide worshipper 	of the deity? 
Certainly, if such Hindus believe in temples.
  If 	the entry 	of the 	untouchables into 	temples depends 	on votes in 	a particular district, 	the condition 	precedent is that 	definite rules should be 	framed as 	to who 	can be treated as a bona-fide worshipper? 
This is correct.
 Which 	of the temples would you treat as public? 
 Any temple which is not the property of an individual or of several individuals.
  Your 	parents were 	staunch followers of 	the Pushtimarga 	(a Vaishnavite 	Sampradaya).Did 	they freely touch the 	untouchables? Would they allow them to enter into temples? 
No.
 You 	have never worn the sacred thread, viz., 	upavita. You 	wore a 
 
 tulsi-kanthilibtech_759_footnotewhen you went to England in 1886. When did you give up that kanthi?
 I used to wear the sacred thread for some time. I did not discard the tulsi-kanthi, but, after I had worn it for some years in  South  Africa, it left me, that is, it snapped.
  Are 	you of the opinion that 	the wearing 	of a sacred 	thread or kanthi 	is not 	essential for 	a sanatanist Hindu? 
I   don’t  regard  the   practice  as  an   essential   requirement   of
sanatana dharma and so, when the kanthi snapped, I did not replace it.
  During 	your stay in England 	you took 	meals in hotels 	or in the house 	of an 	Englishman? 
At both places.
  Are 	you of the opinion that a 	Hindu does not 	cease to 	be a sanatanist Hindu 	by this? 
That is my considered view.
  Even 	now you have 	no objection 	to take 	the food 	prepared in 	European hotels 	or by a Christian 	or a Mohammedan? 
I would have no objection if I otherwise regarded the article as
acceptable food.
  Are 	you in favour 	of the 	priti-bhojanslibtech_760_footnotein which 	even the 	Brahmins, Dheds, Bhangis, 	Chamars, Mohammodans and 	Christians dine together? 
I oppose mixed dinners with Harijans as a part of the movement
 for the removal of untouchability. If, however, the items are cooked with proper regard for rules of hygiene, I see nothing wrong in Harijans and others sitting together and eating from separate plates.
  Will 	you say that the Hindus who take part in such priti-bhojans 	can claim 	to be sanatanist Hindus? 
Provided	the	foregoing	condition	is	observed,	Hindus
 participating in mixed dinners with Harijans should be, ought to be, regarded as sanatanist Hindus—if they have the other characteristics of such Hindus.
  Are 	you in favour of 	intermarriages between 	the Brahmins, 	Kshatriyas and Vaishyas on the one hand and the untouchables on the other? 
If the bride and the bridegroom are a suitable pair, if their lives
 are pure and they believe in the ideal of self-control in married life, I would   certainly   approve   of   such   unions.   But   I   do   not regard
 
 interdining and intermarrying between Harijans and other Hindus as a necessary part of the movement for the eradication of untouchability.
  Do 	you keep any idol or 	any picture 	of Shri 	Rama or Shri 	Krishna when 	you offer 	prayers in the morning 	and at night? 
No.
 Are 	you a staunch believer in idol-worship? 
Yes.
  Do 	you believe 	that it 	is necessary to 	go to a temple 	for darshan 	of the 	image for attaining emancipation and for acquiring supreme love for God ? 
No.
  How 	often have you visited the Hindu temples for the darshan 	of the 	idols during 	the last 	sixteen years? 
I have visited them so often in the course of my tours that I
cannot count the number of times.
  What 	amount have you sent 	as bhet 	or samagri 	to temples 	from the funds 	collected by you? 
I had no right to spend anything on temples from the money I
had collected.
  Do 	you believe that a 	Dhed, Bhangi or 	Chamar cannot attain 	emancipation or acquire 	supreme love for God 	unless he 	gets an 	opportunity to 	go into the Hindu 	temple for darshan? 
I don’t believe so at all.
  If 	you think 	that idol-worship is 	essential for 	the untouchables, what 	if separate temples are built for them with the idols of Shri Rama or Shri Krishna ? 
Since I don’t see any justification for the existence of a separate
 class of untouchable communities, I would not be satisfied by separate temples for them.
  Do 	you think 	that the worship 	of an idol 	in a 	public temple is 	more efficacious than that of an idol installed in the temple built for untouchables? 
No.
  Has 	Mr. Kelappanlibtech_761_footnoteor any 	Dhed, Bhangi or 	Chamar told 	you that he has 	such supreme love for 	the deity, that he 	will lose his 	life if 	he does not 	get darshan  in 	 a temple of 	the sanatanists? 
No.
 
 
  When 	you attended 	the Round 	Table Conference, you 	were under the impression 	that the population 	of the 	Dheds, Bhangis and 	Chamars, who 	are treated as 	untouchables, was 	six or seven crores. 
No.
  Were 	you under 	the same 	impression when you made 	a compromiselibtech_762_footnotewith Mr. 	Ambedkar? 
No.
  Did 	you even take the trouble 	of studying 	the causes 	with a view to ascertain 	the actual 	population of these 	three communities? 
I don’t follow the question.
  Is 	it not a 	fact that the percentage 	of the 	population of 	such untouchables 	varies from 2_ per cent 	in Kathiawar and Gujarat? 
This is not impossible.
  Have 	you even now ascertained the actual population 	of the three 	communities in India? 
I do not know the exact number.
  Is 	it not a fact that lakhs 	of high-caste 	Hindus who were 	touchables became 	Mohammedans during the 	Mohammedan rule 	and Christians after 	the advent of 	the British rule? 
I would be surprised if this is true.
  Can 	you give even 	approximately the 	number of 	the untouchables 	who became 	either Mohammedans or Christians? 
I can say that the number is quite large.
  Are 	you for 	allowing any 	Dhed, Bhangi 	or Chamar admission into 	the Hindu 	temples? If not, what 	conditions or 	restrictions would you 	suggest ? 
 All Dheds, Bhangis and members of other such communities who observe the rules of cleanliness must be entitled to visit temples.
  Who 	will frame these 	conditions and 	restrictions and 	who will enforce 	them? Will this not 	cause constant bickerings? 
 These rules are still accepted, and I think it easier to persuade Harijans to observe them than to persuade other Hindus to do so.
  Has 	a large 	section of the 	Dheds, Bhangis and 	Chamars authorized you 	to create this sort of agitation for securing their entry into the Hindu temples? 
No. The present movement is intended to persuade caste Hindus
 to do their duty.
 
  Do 	you know 	that most of them 	are deadly 	against your agitation and 	say that 	it will widen the gulf between them and the caste Hindus, create 	trouble and make their 	position considerably worse ? 
The truth is the exact opposite of this.
  Are 	you prepared to 	issue a 	referendum for 	ascertaining wishes 	of the 	untouchables in the 	different parts of India? 
In the light of the reply to (44), your suggestion is unnecessary.
  Assuming 	that you suggest 	a compromise 	and it 	is accepted by 	some orthodox 	Hindus, do you 	think that it 	will be 	held as 	binding on 	all the untouchables 	and other orthodox Hindus? 
 The present movement is not a commercial bargain. It is  a purely religious movement. It will show the path of dharma to those who accept it as such.
  Do 	you know that the 	sentiments of 	untouchability are 	rampant even 	amongst the 	Rabaris, Bharavads, 	Kolis, Thakardas, 	Kanbis, Patidars, Rajputs, and 	such other castes? 
That is our misfortune.
  Do 	you know that the Dheds 	do not 	dine with the Bhangis and 	Chamars, and there are separate wells for them in almost all the towns and villages ? 
That is another misfortune.
  Can 	you say with some 	authority that 	the Dheds 	will allow the Bhangis 	and Chamars 	to enter 	into their temples? 
If I can persuade the so-called high-caste Hindus, I think it will
be easy enough to persuade the Harijans.
  Have 	you got a written 	assurance from the bulk 	of the Dheds 	that they will give 	up such 	sentiments if 	public temples are 	opened even to the 	Bhangis and 	Chamars? 
Many persons have given me assurances, though I have nothing
in writing.
  You 	have been constantly 	preaching touchability after 	your return from Africa? 	Will you state 	the number 	of temples 	in the 	towns and 	villages which 	are opened to the untouchables with the consent of the local sanatanists? 
I think the number must be about 500.
  Do 	you not think 	that the Lion 	of India 	who once 	roared and launched 	non-co-operation movement 	against the British 	Government ought not to 	seek help 	from His 	Excellency the 	Viceroy on 	this question ? 
If I reply to this question, I would be violating my promise to
 
 the Government.libtech_763_footnote
  You 	propose to 	fast to 	death if 	the Viceroy 	does not sanction 	the Bill. Is 	this by way of resentment against the Viceroy or the obstinate sanatanists? 
The reply to this question is contained in the reply to question
  You 	do not think 	that your 	identification with 	the question will prejudicially 	affect reverence 	of the 	sanatanists for 	you and practically wreck 	the Congress and 	strengthen hands 	of the 	British statesmen 	who are against 	giving substantial 	rights to India? 
I do not believe so.
 Do you not think that the reverence for you is your real strength? 
Whatever power I have is Rama’s, not mine.
 Are 	you prepared to face the human nature as it is? 
That is what I have done all my life.
  Do 	you really appreciate the 	practical difficulties 	in the way of accomplishment 	of your desire? 
I think I am fully aware of the difficulties.
  Can 	 you  suggest a  practical 	  way   by   which   	public   temples 	  may  be opened to the 	untouchables without  	creating  a  split 	 or  tension 	 among the Hindus 	? 
I have certainly made my suggestions.
  Can 	the Jains, who 	are not Hindus by 	religion, and 	the Hindus who 	are against 	idol-worship, and who 	have therefore 	nothing at stake, 	ask the Viceroy 	to sanction 	the Bill? 
No.
  Has 	any of the so-called 	benefactors of the 	untouchables built or 	offered to 	build any 	temple for 	the untouchables? 
No.
  What 	harm is there 	if separate 	temples, having due 	regard to 	local needs, 	are built, 	and the question 	of the 	entry into the temples 	built and maintained 	by the 	sanatanists is shelved? 
That will harm sanatana dharma itself.
  Have 	you ever 	stayed long in places 	of pilgrimage 	with a view 	to correctly 	ascertain the depth of the religious sentiments of sanatanist males and females ? 
Yes.
 
  Is it not a fact that the heart, and not the body, is the seat of love? 
It is so.
  Is 	it a fact that the 	sacred books of 	the Hindus lay 	the greatest stress on 	the mutual 	touch by heart? 
True.
  Is 	it not a 	fact that it 	is the lack 	of mutual 	touch by heart 	which creates wars and disputes among families and nourishes civil and criminal courts? 
Quite true.
  You 	know that during 	the dire famine of Samvat 1956libtech_764_footnote,numerous 	sanatanists fed 	the needy and 	supplied clothes? Can 	you point to 	a single instance of 	the untouchables 	having been denied that benefit ? 
There is no limit to that.
  Do 	you not think 	that the non-touchability 	of the 	Hindu women in 	menses is based on the principle of purity? Does it breathe any hatred for them ? 
That is right. It implies no contempt.
  Should 	a Hindu 	take his bath 	and wash 	his clothes 	if he touches 	a corpse 	or any 	dead creature ? 
They should purify themselves.
  You 	know that among then 	Parsis the 	women in 	menses are 	treated as 	untouchables for 	eight days. 
I have heard that it is so.
  Do 	you know that no 	pious Mohammedan would go 	to a Masjid for 	prayers if there be a drop of urine or pus on any of his clothes? 
That is true.
  Supposing 	that a majority 	of people 	in a particular 	village or town 	believe that to drink is no vice, should the minority also drink? 
Never.
  Are 	you of the 	opinion that dharma 	should be defined 	according to 	the notions 	of the 	majority in 	a particular locality ? 
Whatever the theory, the practice will remain what the majority
 does.    Do you know that about 80 per cent of the boys attending schools and  
  colleges, 	who wear a white khaddar cap, do not visit temples even once a year; 	and most of them state that the sacred books of the Hindus should be 	thrown into the sea ? I 	would be surprised and pained if this is true.    
  Have 	you ever 	advised these 	boys to visit 	temples for 	darshan at 	least once 	a fortnight 	or a month? 
No.
  Do 	you not think 	that if the 	administration of 	India be 	entrusted to 	the people 	of such 	views, they 	would follow in 	the footsteps 	of Russia, 	whose policy is to 	make the country Godless? 
I have no such fear.
  Have 	you ever cared to ascertain the percentage of boys referred to in 	Q.74, who offer prayers to God even once a day ? 
Generally all pray at least once every day.
  Do 	you know that 	the ladies residing 	in the  ‘Vanita  	Vishram’libtech_765_footnoteand 	numerous educated high-caste ladies do not observe menses? 
I do not know.
 Has not Shri Krishna said that dear unto him is one who causes no udvegalibtech_766_footnote 
 to others? What are your notions about the ahimsa dharma?
I have replied to this question in many of my articles.
  Can 	you point to 	two males or 	females having similar 	features of the body, 	etc., from the population of 180 crores of the earth? 
No.
  Is 	it possible to 	expect all 	human beings to 	be of the same 	temperament or the 	same habits? 
No.
  Do 	you not think 	that the 	contact of 	high-caste Hindus 	with the untouchables in their present state would do considerable harm to the former? 
 If the so-called high-caste Hindus really deserve to be called high-caste, mixing with Harijans will, instead of harming them, benefit both themselves and the Harijans. Even if they do not possess the kind of heart about which you have asked a question above, they will benefit by freely mixing with the Harijans because such mixing concerns the heart.
  All 	tinctures contain liquor. 	Would you 	advise those who 	take them to 	take liquor or to give up 	the tinctures? 
Personally I would appeal to them to give up drinking tinctures.
 Can you point to any Rajput ruler following the Buddhistic religion, or to 
 
 any Mohammedan ruler who had compelled the sanatanists to allow the untouchables to enter their temples?
I don’t know of any.
  Do 	you think that if 	the British 	Government were to 	violate the 	repeated sacred 	pledges of absolute 	non-intervention in 	religious matters, it 	would contribute 	to their 	stability and to peace 	and contentment among men? 
No.
  Does 	Malaviyaji take meals or 	do Sandhya-Gayatrilibtech_767_footnotewithout taking a 	bath if 	he has touched any untouchable person? 
This question should be addressed to Malaviyaji.
  If 	the sentiments 	of the 	Hindus who 	support you 	on this 	question do 	not materially 	differ from those of our 	friend Mr. 	Shaukat Ali, is 	it not open to 	him to say that he 	too is 	a sanatanist? And 	can he be our 	teacher as 	to what the 	sanatana dharma 	is? 
It is beyond my power to say what Maulana Shaukat Ali can do.
  Is 	it a fact 	that most of the 	Dheds, Bhangis 	and Chamars 	take beef even 	now? Do 	you think that they can 	be all Harijans? 
I know that all of them do not eat beef. Certainly all of them can
become Harijans.

  	Your letter arrived as usual. Also your notes on Dr. Gour’s book.  	I always omit to tell you about what our common friends write about 	you. They all think of you, would like to write to you if you could 	receive their letters and invariably send their love to  you. Among 	these are the Kingsley Hall people, the Privats, the Italian 	sisters, the Larks of St. Francis and Mary Barr. This is not an  	exhaustive list, it is only an illustrative list. But I must send 	you some    
 of the letters themselves. Thus you will find Madeleine’slibtech_775_footnoteletter and a copy of my reply, Andrews’s and John Morris’s, the blind man. I must not omit Agatha, Esther, Horace and the Woodbrookelibtech_776_footnotepeople. They never fail to remember you whenever they write. You will find with this also John Morris’s X’mas card and one of the very beautiful picture-cards that Princess Aristarchi sends every week. She seems to be a learned woman of deep devotion.
 You are late with your remarks about the primus stove. It was banished from the Ashram now some two months ago. I ought to have written to you then. On learning of the death of Prof. Trivedi’s brother’s wife from the primus-lighting, I wrotelibtech_777_footnoteto Narandas that the best way to mourn the event was to banish the stove altogether from the Ashram. It was a hard job to convince some of the women. But they all realized the necessity. The banishment was not made compulsory. Everyone gave it up voluntarily. I should have given you this pleasing information before but how many such titbits I must be omitting every week! However, I know that you do not expect such things from me. And yet if I do not tell them to you, you remain ignorant of all the happenings in the Ashram which you should and may under the prison rules know. I must do what I can.
 My weight is the same as last week and so is the food. No salt as yet. It is no deprivation for me. There is no craving for it. When I take it, I like it. But I would not like anything the moment I knew that it was harmful for me. The elbow pain remains what it was, not the slightest cause for anxiety.
 You need not return the enclosed letters and the cards. Love from us all.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter for which I thank you. Your letter seems to me to be an illustration of the imaginary quarrel between the poor wife and her many husbands. You say you will not allow my will to thwart your allegiance to God and your conscience. I say I am not going to allow a few million out of my 300 millions to thwart my allegiance to God, my conscience and, what is perhaps more pertinent for you, my allegiance to my other many million husbands. So you see the odds against me are not even. Husbands can always play ducks and drakes with their wives, for they always play with loaded dice. But God has gifted wives with infinite patience. So, you will see how at the end of it   I bear down the opposition of the very few husbands out of many who are up in arms against me, and when the quarrel is over, you will shed crocodile tears over the scars “the whole host” of you may leave on your poor wife and then make her forget all about her past miseries.
 You appeal to me to exploit your sympathy for the economic betterment of the backward classes. I invite you to make a sporting offer.
 Your argument, I hope, you don’t want me to take seriously, or, if you do, then I must ask you dispassionately to study all the statements that I have been making, and you will find that every one of the questions raised by you is sufficiently answered therein.

MY DEAR VENKATAPPAYYA,
 
 I have your letter.libtech_785_footnoteI fear that your suggestion is fatal, especially at the present moment. To set up new temples would be to set up a new religion and accept defeat. If it is to be defeat, I should take it and resign myself to it, but I will not set up a new religion. If our contention is right and the public reject it, we should know that untouchability is not to be destroyed or even shaken during our time. Whether the contemplated legislation should be there or  not  is  a matter that should be examined on its own merits. I have come to the conclusion that both from the point of view of interference in matters religious and seeking Viceregal sanction, it is free from reproach. Any time we would want legislation in order to correct errors and, in the hottest non-co-operation days, I should not hesitate to promote legislation backed by public will. No law or rule can be cited to defeat its own end. You may then be sure that there is flaw  in  your reasoning. The cry of religious interference is perfectly thoughtless where it is not obviously hypocritic[al]. Of course, there is a third objection to the proposed Bill, namely, that the question who should or should not enter a temple should not be decided by those who are temple-goers’ but by some extraneous authority, in this instance, learned men. I totally deny the validity of that proposition. No religion could grow under such a chilling rule. Hindu religion, so far as I know it, has never followed any such rule. Mind, I do not insist that all old temples should be opened to Harijans, but I do insist that all old temples should be opened where the majority of present worshippers are willing. It is the acid test of the sincerity or the reality of the Bombay Resolution.
 I suppose we must resign ourselves to the prospect of your wife
 
 law if public opinion is secured in favour of the movement and legislation will be of no value if public opinion is adverse.”

CHI. NARANDAS,
 Read my letterlibtech_792_footnoteto Mirabehn and pass it on to her. I hope your asthma has left you.
 Mirabehn is your neighbour now. Send her fruits and any other things which she may need. I hope Mahavir and the party have left. That was the best course. The arrangement which you have made is right.
 Keep a regular register for recording people’s weights and get everybody weighed at fixed intervals.
 Did you see the account of expenditure which Mahavir prepared from memory? If you have not seen it and wish to see it, let me know and I will send it to you. I have preserved it. It did not satisfy me. I hope you remember that I asked you to send Kellogg’s book and Satyarthapr-akashlibtech_793_footnote.
 It was necessary to write a long letter to Prema explaining everything, and, therefore, though I am rather hard pressed for time, I found the necessary time and have written it. Though the letter is addressed to her, it is meant for all, that is, for all workers of the Ashram. I hope you had noted the difference between workers of the Ashram and inmates of the Ashram which I had explained in  a previous letter. My remarks about you in the letter were necessary. It is not merely formal courtesy on the part of a father but it is his moral
 
 duty to express the faith which he has in his son. May God grant you, whenever the occasion arises, the necessary strength to justify  my faith. I am sure that these words of mine will not upset you.

         January 	12, 1933   BHAI 	NALAVDE, Your 	letter.  	The Harijan brethren certainly have the right to give up 	carrion-eating as well as disposal of dead cattle. But it would be 	better if they took the vow to give up carrion-eating. The duty of 	removal of dead cattle has the sanction of society. After all 	someone has  to perform this duty. The public will certainly be put 	to hardship if those who are well versed in the job give it up. It 	is the dharma of all to protect society from this difficulty. 	Therefore if necessary this job may be given up only after coming to 	some arrangements with . . .libtech_794_footnotelibtech_795_footnotethe mahajanlibtech_796_footnote. 	The giving up of carrion-eating is, however, obligatory. Those 	who give up beef and carrion-eating and have proper bath, etc., 	should be entitled to enter temples. They too should thus qualify 	themselves for darshan of the image and be confident that 	they will have the right of temple-entry.  	Those who do not give up carrion-eating should not be summarily 	boycotted. They should have the chance of reforming themselves. It 	is not an easy matter for everyone to give up a long-standing habit.  	I hope that the Conference will be successful. I also hope that all 	the Harijan brothers and sisters will resolve on self-reform.  Yours,  MOHANDAS 	GANDHI  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 801

  	I have received all your letters. I have already stated that my mind 	and heart are open for a discussion with you. Though I have not been 	given enough time to write to the Shastris I have in mind, I 	have sent invitations to those who can come immediately. I still do 	not know whether they will be able to come. The subject for  our 	discussion is not whether untouchability is sanctioned by the 	Shastras or not. The subject is to determine the sanction of the 	Shastras for untouchability as it is practised today. And if the 	untouchability in current usage has the sanction of the Shastras, 	then who  can  be defined as untouchable? I certainly desire in all 	humility to hear your views on these two questions and other points 	that may arise out of these and I hope you are now satisfied and 	will honour me by coming over.

Yours,  From 	a microfilm of the Hindi: S.N. 19229         January 	13, 1933   MY 	DEAR PURANDARE,  	I have your letter. I am sorry to have had it. I don’t like the 	spirit underlying it. You have looked upon the whole thing as a 	commercial transaction, whereas I have looked upon the whole thing 	as a matter of selfless service. You left the question of 	remuneration entirely in my hands, although I asked you to tell me 	what you would charge for giving me a corrected collection of your 	speeches on untouchability and for supervising the printing. But you 	would not think of it, telling me that there was no mercenary motive 	behind it. That being so, I had no hesitation in undertaking the 	delicate task, but at the end of it, I shirked it, and I asked 	Haribhau to name the sum. He named Rs. 125 and I straightaway 	accepted. Believe me, so far as I am concerned, I did not think of 	the Arya Bhushan bill in connection with fixing up your fee, 	remuneration or honorarium, whatever it may be called. Nor did I 	then know nor do I now know that the Arya Bhushan bill is 	exorbitant. My understanding is that they should not make anything 	but nominal profits. You are thinking of anything between Rs. 500 to 	3,000. I can only meet your proposal with a reasonable offer. You 	can take over the book yourself by simply paying the printing 	charges and sell the book on your own account and make whatever 	profit you can, only you should not increase the published price, 	for any increase in the price would be unjust to the public.     
 I have already asked Haribhau to pay you Rs. 125 if you would accept the amount in full payment and not feel any dissatisfaction. For I would be deeply hurt if, after having left the thing in my hands, you were dissatisfied with the amount declared by me.

DEAR SATYANANDA BABOO,
 You are always so good and always think of me whenever there is anything to say to me.
 I think that this is hardly the time to consider improvements in Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill. The first thing is to get the Viceregal sanction. When that is had, many improvements may be possible. I am not therefore just now applying my mind to your suggestionlibtech_801_footnote. After the principle of the Bill is once accepted, the Government themselves may take it up or may advise amendments so far as that may be necessary to free the Bill from any possible political mischief. So far as I am concerned, my one thought in connection with the temple-entry is the purification of caste Hindus. But of course I shall bear your suggestions in mind whenever the occasion arises for their use.

 MY DEAR C.R.,"

 January 13, 1933
  	Vallabhbhai had a battle royal with me last night on your  behalf. 	If a person, an utter stranger to him, had chance to be there, from 	the vehemence of Vallabhbhai’s language, he would have concluded 	that we must be most quarrelsome persons.  	He thought that I was doing violent injustice to you, inasmuch as, 	without consultation with you, I made proposals that might prove to 	be utterly embarrassing, as had happened on two occasions.  	The cause of our quarrel was my compromise proposallibtech_804_footnote. 	He thought that I had no right to publish it without consultation 	with you, and he was quite sure that though you were too good to 	mention it to me, you had felt very much embarrassed by it, if not 	also irritated. I told him that you were too good to conceal your 	embarrassment from me, if you were really embarrassed, and that 	would be quite unlike you. I even added that in this particular 	instance you happened even to like my proposal and that even if it 	was discovered that you did not like it and that you were really 	embarrassed, it was impossible for me every time to consult you, or 	such other colleagues on such occasions. I went further and argued 	that work on such lines would become almost impossible. People act 	together when there is a general agreement between them on 	fundamentals and [provided] that their deductions from those 	fundamentals were, as a rule, identical, and that if, at times, they 	came to different deductions, a timely confession of error would 	keep their friendship in tact, as also the common cause. Nothing 	that I could say, however, would conciliate Vallabhbhai. The curfew 	bell, mutually agreed upon by us, came to the rescue, and put an end 	to what promised to be an endless discussion. But I retired to bed 	with a determination that I would refer the matter to you. Your 	reply, one way or the other, would bring some consolation to your 	counsel, and you know that it won’t make me disconsolate if you 	agreed with your counsel on both his propositions,  namely,  that 	before giving to the world the compromise proposal which I had given 	to Pandit Panchanan Tarkaratna I should have consulted you, and that 	it, as a matter of fact, did embarrass you. You would also add    
 to your opinion on these points, your opinion whether on merits you consider my proposal to be sound or otherwise.
 A perfect tragedy was enacted here yesterday. Five pandits and their five advisers came to the jail gate yesterday an hour and a half after the appointed time and took two hours and a half in exchanging brief notes with me, the three noteslibtech_805_footnotethat they exchanged with me taking all the two hours and a half. And, will you believe it, when I tell you that they would not come in and carry on the discussion because  I would not remove one word I had added to their draft, the word being an adjective added to the word ‘untouchables’. The adjective applied was ‘as at present classified’. Of course it altered the whole scope of their discussion. So they went away. Of course it is not our position that there is no untouchability at all in the Shastras. Our position is that there is no untouchability in the Shastras as we practise it today. They were expected to prove that untouchability as at present practised has sanction in the Shastras. It is an impossible task to  perform honestly. No text that has yet been cited on their behalf has proved it. The Shastris on our behalf are really very learned men, and also pious men. It is their honest conviction that there is no warrant for the untouchability of the present day in the Shastras. The real untouchability will be there for all time. It is a sound hygienic rule practised all over the world.
 Yours sincerely,

655,"January 13, 1933",LETTER TO GEORGE JOSEPH,"
    
 January 13, 1933
 
MY DEAR JOSEPH,
 You can better imagine than I can describe my joy at receiving your letter, and especially your letterlibtech_806_footnoteto Pyarelal. I shall try to have your letter delivered to him. But let me say two things in connection with that letter.
 
 My fast was not a fast unto death in its literal sense. The Roman Catholic priest, who is a visitor to this prison, knows me, and when I was on the eve of taking that fast, he came over to me in his kindly manner just to say one word, and he said how he drew the distinction between a suicide and a sacrifice. A suicide carried with it a certainty of destruction. A sacrifice meant risking life, the greater the risk, the greater the sacrifice. But there should be nothing beyond risk. I had no hesitation in agreeing with the distinction, and my fast being conditional was not a fast amounting to suicide, but it was a fast involving the greatest risk, but still a risk and no more.
 You will be interested to know that some of my Roman Catholic friends have detected no flaw in the fast. Of course, in Hinduism some few extreme cases there are in which ending of life is peremptory, but these I need not consider at present. There is general agreement between Hinduism and other faiths that suicide is a sin.
 Now, about the Inner Voice.libtech_807_footnoteHere again I can agree with you whole-heartedly when you say that the voice of God  can  never counsel or ountenance sin. Encouragement to sin can only come from the devil. But the real difficulty comes in when the question of sin itself is debatable. Those who would consider a particular act to be sinful will naturally reject the claim that it was prompted by God. Hence it was that in answer to a question I said that whilst in self-defence and for the sake of truth which I worship I was bound to say what I believed, my claim was not to be accepted as part of argument in determining relevant questions. The opponents were bound to rule [out] that claim as wholly beside the point. Whether the claim for the voice of God was well or ill-made in a particular case can only be decided after the claimant’s death, and in some extraordinary cases it may even then be difficult. Apart from the  danger  of hypocrisy there is the still greater danger of self-deception to which mankind is prone, and it is possible for self-deceived people to attain great things and yet their claim that the voice of God was behind their acts might be wholly wrong. These are final difficulties which will remain to the end of time, but if the truth is to make any progress, then self-deluded people must also be allowed full play.
 Finally comes the question of confession. You may not know that I have some very valued Roman Catholic friends also. I am in the habit of picking up knowledge more from personal contact than from
 
 printed texts. These friends have not yet been able to clearly define the function of Confession and the Confessor. For instance, what is one to confess who has no consciousness of guilt and when there is, I can understand a Confessor granting absolution, but can he also guide the future acts of the penitent? In the place of the Confessor Hinduism has the Guru. I have all my life striven to find one, one to whom I can shift all my burdens and roam about merely doing his will. But then such implicit limitless obedience is not a mechanical act; and having got the spirit of obedience instinctively within me I would be satisfied by nothing less than tendering complete obedience. But it seems to me that it is not given to all to find the true Guru in this short span of life. But it is given to all to make that diligent search, and it may be that that very search is its own reward, and that it keeps one in possession of peace and joy everlasting. Anyway, you will accept my testimony that ceaseless search has not only given me such joy and peace, but has protected me from conscious error.
 I thank you for copying for me that extract from Imitation of Christ. I read that book in one single sitting, I think, in the year 1905 or 1906, and a friend, only a few months ago, sent me another copy.
With our love to all of you,
 Yours sincerely,

BHAISHRI MAVALANKAR,
 I got your letter. Vinabehn also told me about your illness. Illness does not spare even a lawyer, nor the chairman of a municipality! It is something to be thankful for that you will be able to move about soon.
 I read Keshavji’s questions. We should willingly endure a great many things like this to atone for the sins of our ancestors and our contemporaries. When to suspicion is added selfishness, you  can expect nothing better. But I suppose the skin of your  back has become sufficiently thick by now so that you feel such blows as light
 as flowers.
 Thakkar Bapalibtech_808_footnotesuggests that I should write to Dadalibtech_809_footnotefor the Harijan fund. Since when did you become Dada? It must have been before I was born. May you live long and serve the Harijans. Bapa suggests that you should use your influence with Vaishnavas like Chimanbhai, Sakarbhai, etc. They may not permit Harijans to enter temples for darshan, but they should liberally help with money for activities other than the movement for temple-entry. But need one commend the cause of the tongue to the teeth? If Bapa’s word does not carry weight with Dada, how can Bapu of merely fifteen years, standing hope that his will? I have only passed on to you the load put on my head by Bapa. He has also ordered me to write to Kasturbhailibtech_810_footnoteand make a similar request to him. May I give you my power of attorney?
 Since you have just risen from the sick-bed, I tried to lighten business with a little humour and that has made the letter long. I, therefore, leave it to you to speak to Kasturbhai. As for Chimanbhai, I also will write to him.

 I must continue to dictate. You are entitled to call yourself an Indian since you have felt like one from your childhood, but that is not a substitute for your German birth. The adoption should be an addition both to your name and to your strength, and what can be finer than that we should all add on the virtues of our own nations to those of the others!
 Why was there a struggle to choose between Gurudev and myself? We are no competitors. Gurudev occupies a throne which belongs to him by sheer merit. I have none of the gifts that he has, and what is more, we dearly love each other, and as years roll on, our love becomes stronger, and we understand also each other better and better. I would have you therefore to say that you like us both equally for whatever gifts God has bestowed upon us. No more therefore of
 
 choice-making, if you would be a real daughter like Mira.

          DEAR 	FRIEND,       January 	14, 1933 
  	I have your letter. The question is not so much what the Harijans 	need, but how the caste Hindus should behave towards them. In my 	opinion, it is the clear duty of caste Hindus to give to the 	Harijans the same rights that they enjoy. The fact that evil has 	survived numberless generations does not make it any the less an 	evil. Similarly, the fact that untouchability has survived the great 	religious teachers whom you name does not warrant the present 	generation in continuing it, if it can be proved to be an evil. I am 	convinced it is.  	A person who has heard the inner call should still be open to reason 	and therefore conviction. That attitude enables him and others to 	test the truth of his claim.  	I do say with my conception of Hinduism that God denies Himself what 	Harijans are denied, because they are called Harijans.  Yours 	sincerely,  SJT. 	M.

 I want to warn you against resisting nature beyond the saturation point. In Biblical language, I should say: “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord, thy God.” I would say without the slightest hesitation, if you have another bad attack you should treat it as the clearest call from God to return to England and render what service you can render there. If God wants you here, the first thing He would give you is health of body. If you have humbly to acknowledge defeat,  you should do so. Your defeat will be victory for God of truth. There is no
 
 waste in God’s laboratory. The work begun there by you will not die.  I do not mind if one man who has good health and is  beyond  reproach in character is there in sole charge. If there is no  such worker just now, let the whole thing be temporarily wound up. This is no doleful picture. It is the real background for a Godly life. “Not my will, but thine, of Truth.” I must not prolong this sermon. You know what I mean. Where there is complete surrender, there is no room for self-will.

 I asked you to write to me about the Chharas. Their harassment of us seems to have stopped. Does a bhajan party visit  their  settlement? Has the Government posted police to keep  watch  on them?
 Prema causes me some worry. Her conduct frightens me. If she  is silent because she has realized her error, I need not mind. If, however, she is silent because she is angry, she has more serious defect of character than I had thought. Try and discover, if yoiu can, what is in her heart.
 If you have any news about Gangabehn, Kusum and Lilavati, le me have it.

 DISCUSSION WITH “ THE TIMES OF INDIA” REPRESENTATIVE
 November 21, 1932
 REPRESENTATIVE: Have you decided to devote the rest of your  life  to eradication of untouchability?
 GANDHIJI: I cannot say that that is my present intention or that there is a poss- ibility of it. It is wholly true to say that my life is devoted to this most important reform of Hindu dharma. But then my life is devoted to so many other things. I cannot divide my life into water-tight compartments. My life is indivisible. The root of all my activities is the same. In every sphere of life, be it small or big, my aim is to promote truth and ahimsa. This morning I read an article appearing in The Times of India. I would like to say something about it. I wish to correct an error in your editorial. It is not correct to say that all the questions regarding giving social rights to Harijans are covered by temple-entry. Temple-entry is just one of the many questions. If today it has come to the fore it is not because of me. At my request Shri Kelappan has given up his fast. So I am under an obligation to help him. Therefore, naturally, I have to do all I can to attract public attention to Guruvayur and see that before the second of January, the famous temple is thrown open to Harijans. The fast will be only to get that temple opened and no other. The fast will not be of my choosing. Only if Shri Kelappan is obliged to fast, it becomes my duty to undertake a fast too. In the effort to have the temple opened to Harijans, there is no thought of coercing any section of society. According to the information I have—and I have no cause to doubt the truth of it—many caste Hindus are in favour of throwing open the temples to Harijans. If this is so, it cannot be said that there was coercion. It may be kept in mind that though this question was put before the public only recently, Shri Kelappan and his associates have been working for it for a long time. And if he has won the public over to his view, it has not happened in a few days. It is the result of many years of sustained work.
 R. Is your duty towards Shri Kelappan so great that if he undertakes a fast you must stake your life ?
 G. If I lose self-respect, I would at once become useless for any kind of service.    I do not consider it a great thing to risk my life to keep a pledge made in all awareness in a just cause.
 R. Do you consider this of more importance than the work you are doing for the Harijan cause?
 G. Once I have violated a pledge, my life would be of no use to Harijans. But if in keeping a vow I have to die, it will be in my view a precious thing not only for the Harijans, not only for Hinduism, but I humbly submit, for the whole of India and the entire world.
 R. Since you do not believe in image-worship, why are you taking so much trouble to have the right of image-worship given to Harijans?
 G. I don’t think I have ever said that I have no faith in image-worship. I don’t remember that there is anything of this sort in my articles either. What I have repeatedly said is that I am both an iconoclast and an idolator. Is it not a very different thing from saying that I have no faith in image-worship? But if someone says that I hardly ever go to a temple, it will be quite true. I would not like to go into the reasons why I don’t visit the temples. But I will say this: that my religion is so all-embracing that I go with the same devotion to a Hindu temple, a Muslim mosque, a Christian church or a Jewish synagogue. I have never gone to any of these places as an atheist or a critic, but always with full devotion.

 DISCUSSION WITH “FREE PRESS” REPRESENTATIVE libtech_820_footnote
 December 3, 1932
  From 	the point 	of view 	of the 	duty of 	the caste 	Hindus the question 	of Guruvayur 	is not a small 	one. It is wholly 	wrong to use the phrase 	‘uplift of Harijans’. 	According to 	me, the first 	duty of 	the caste 	Hindus towards the 	Harijans is 	to throw open all the temples to them which are open to others.  I 	would not place 	the responsibility for 	temple-entry on 	the Anti-Untouchability 	League. Before the League 	was born, 	the question 	of Guruvayur 	was before the 	people. The 	League should certainly 	do as much 	as it can 	about the matter. 	But if 	the temple 	is not 	thrown open 	within the 	time fixed for it, the Sangh 	would not deserve to be castigated more than the other institutions.  If 	it is proved that 	Guruvayur is a private 	temple, there can be no 	ground for 	the fast.  If 	the reformers 	are truthful 	and humble, 	they can bring 	about a change 	of heart 	in the 	sanatanists. They should 	bear in mind 	that before they became reformers, 	they were sailing in 	the same 	boat with the sanatanists. 
 
  Reformers 	are trying 	their best to 	cultivate public opinion. 	And as a reformer 	myself, I think 	that public 	opinion has veered 	towards the reform 	to a 	considerable degree. 	I do 	not believe 	at all 	that most of 	the Hindus 	are under 	the influence 	of dharmacharyas. They 	listen to 	the Shankaracharya 	and other acharyas 	only to 	the extent 	it suits 	them. Suppose the 	Shankaracharya issues 	an injunction 	that nobody 	should drink liquor, do 	you think 	everyone will abide 	by it? 	If the 
 dharmacharyas themselves observe restraint, then only can they make others do so.
  I 	cannot wait 	to see 	myself fully restored 	before I undertake 	the fast. 	I believe that it will be 	at the command of God. When my body is weak, I am better able  to 	stand fasting.  Millions 	of people—if 	they love me—will 	be distressed 	by my fast. 	They will 	raise such a powerful voice that it will become irresistible. There 	is a war between me and 	untouchability. If 	you want me 	to live, untouchability 	has to 	go. If 	you want 	untouchability to 	stay, I 	have to die.

 APPENDIX IV
 DISCUSSION WITH POONA SANATANISTS
 December 7, 1932
 GANDHlJI: Temple-entry is a purely religious question. I have never regarded it as a question of expediency. For me religion is practice. Every Hindu has the right to go to a temple. The rules regarding personal hygiene apply to all. The custom of admitting Hindus of one particular class into temples has been in vogue for many years. But which Hindus should be admitted into a temple and which not is not a religious question. About this only the temple-goers should be consulted. Dharmashastras should not be brought in. The few who are left out should not coerce others. They should build another temple for themselves. From what study I have made of my religion, I feel that for those who are not permitted in other temples, the temple should be opened for a few hours. True religion is that which leads to spiritual progress and for which we are ready to sacrifice everything. The temple should be thrown open for ‘touchables’ for a few hours; but if the reformers are few, it cannot be thrown open to untouchables. The question of minority and majority arose from my fast. In answer to those who doubted if the majority wanted temples to be opened to untouchables, a referendum was suggested. If you prove beyond doubt that temple-entry by untouchables is against the Shastras, I shall be helpless.
 QUESTION: Do you promise to listen to the Shastris if they secure a 51 per cent majority?
 G. I would give up the fast today if you prove it to be adharma.
 Q. Would you consider this opportunity for a discussion with the Shastris ?
 G. Whether it is my good luck or bad luck, you people have come here because of my fast. I had resolved that it was our duty to throw open the temples. I decided this long ago. I met the Shastris at Vaikom. They showed me Shankara Smriti and translated it too. But there was nothing in it to support what the Shastris said. I shall, of course, listen to you, since you have come to throw new light on the question; but, in the course of  discussion I  will not give up  the resolve to  fast. I  read through many
 granthas and their translations and in the end decided that that which stands the test
 of ahimsa and truth is dharma. I did not go to the Gita, instead the Gita came to me. The Gita is for me an independent support. To save myself from all sorts of criticisms,  I fell back on my faith, reason and bhakti. If what you say appeals to my reason, I shall say that I have lost on the rational plane. Then I shall depend on my heart. You will have to satisfy my heart.
 Q. Will it not follow that what appeals to your heart is your dharma?
 G. Whatever appeals to a man’s heart is dharma to him. Dharma cannot be reached by the intellect. It can only be reached by the heart. That is why it is for fools too. The question of temple-entry is purely religious. To alter my views is very difficult indeed because behind my views is a past. An ordinary man cannot decide what is and what is not dharma as regards temple-entry. It would be a mistake on my part to advocate temple-entry, if I regard it as adharma. But after a prolonged study and experience I have come to believe that it is our religious duty to throw open the temples to Harijans. I do not want to force on others what I have decided for myself. But I tell you that if your heart does not rebel against the existing tradition, I will be forced to undertake a fast. If it rebels, there will be no need for me to undertake it. I have already decided for myself. People have to decide for themselves.
 Q. How can we appeal to your heart?
 G. It is the teacher’s duty to convey the lesson to the student. How to do it, is the teacher’s look out. If he does not know this, how can he be called a teacher? Where am I to look for the guru? The guru should find me. If I go in search of him, I may stumble. Man does not have to go in quest of God. If we have to go in quest of Him, is It God? God finds His servants and devotees.
 Q. Please talk in Sanskrit.
 G. I am an ignoramus. If I were a pundit like you, I would not have allowed you  to come here or I would have locked you up. I would have said, ‘Go away, my study of Shastras is different from yours.’

                   MY 	DEAR MAHATMAJI,   APPENDIX 	V  LETTER FROM DR. 	B. C. ROYlibtech_822_footnote         36 	WELLINGTON STREET,  CALCUTTA,  December 	12, 1932 
  Your 	letter reached me 	yesterday. I 	heard from 	Mr. Khaitan the 	details of 	the discussion he  had  with  you  	regarding  the  Bengal   	Anti-Untouchability   	Board. You 	told him that you  were  	going  to 	 write   to   me.   After  hearing 	 Mr.   Khaitan, 	I was prepared for a 	letter from you such as you have sent me. Before I proceed further, 	you will allow me to mention that the position of the Presidentship of the Bengal    
 Board was not of my seeking and I now know that Mr. Birla had, after consultation with you and with your approval, selected me as President. When the call came, I agreed, in spite of my imperfections and my other pre-occupations. I do not forget also that the whole scheme originated with you and friends who met at Poona and, therefore, when these friends wanted me to do so, I accepted the responsibility. You asked me to be the President because you were then convinced that I could do the work. Now that you do not feel so sure and want me to withdraw, I gladly do so. I am writing to Mr. Birla today offering my resignation. It is no matter of self-abnegation for me, because I have never in my life occupied any place or position for a moment when those who have it in their gift desired that I should not continue to do so.
 You have, in your letter, suggested that I should call all workers representing different groups and parties and let them choose whomsoever they like as President. May I point out to you that under the constitution of the League, the President of the Central Board nominates the Presidents of the Provincial Boards, who in their turn nominate the members of the Provincial Boards. I have no power to dissolve the Board already formed in Bengal. It is not, therefore, possible for me to follow your instructions even if I desired to, but I am referring the whole matter to Mr. Birla, the President of the All-India Board for him to take such action as he chooses.
 You  say  in  your  letter:  ‘But  I  see  that   the   idea   has   not   found   favour in Bengal.’  I  feel  it  my  duty  to  inform  you  that  in  Bengal  there  are  many parties and groups, besides those led by Sjt. Satis Das Gupta and Dr. Suresh Banerji, who are interested in removal of untouchability and who are doing very valuable work now. We framed the Bengal Board very carefully and, as Syt. Debi Prasad Khaitan must have told you, the Board was representative of the various groups. Many of the district bodies already in existence have written to us signifying their desire to co-operate with the Board and in fact we have had no refusal except, as Syt. Khaitan told you, from Messrs Das Gupta and Banerji, though each had different reasons. As you, however, seem to think that in Bengal a Board cannot function effectively unless with the co-operation of Syt. Das Gupta and Dr. Banerji, which they have refused to give, there is no option left but to dissolve the Board.
 As the work of the League has already begun in Bengal, it would be difficult for me and the members of my Board to explain the position unless I get your permission to send this letter and the first paragraph of your letter to the Press. I hope you have no objection.
 Yours sincerely,
 B. C. ROY

  APPENDIX VI  LETTER FROM E. 	E. DOYLE TO R. M. MAXWELLlibtech_823_footnote         POONA, 
     MY 	DEAR MAXWELL,  December 	8, 1932 
  I 	had hardly 	put down the receiver 	after telephoning 	you, when I 	received a 	communication from 	Gandhi—further “mahseer 	wriggle”—I attach a 	copy of 	his letter, 	I shall 	send the original 	by Registered 	Post tomorrow, as the 	alterations are 	in his 	own handwriting, and 	it is much 	too important 	a document 	to chance 	going astray in 	the Post.  As 	soon as I received his letter I went down to Yeravda and found him 	interviewing a ‘deputation’—however I got him apart and had a 	real talk—I told him straight that there was not a vestige of 	truth in the statement, as far as I was aware, that so-called 	high-caste prisoners had been doing conservancy work for several 	months in Ratnagiri Prison and that I had not issued any orders 	stopping this work. Also that when I saw him last he had appreciated 	Government’s inability to give a reply “off-hand”, and 	realized that if this question was to be considered 	on an all-India basis and 	thoroughly examined 	it must take time—and that I had reported this to Government. 	After a great deal of hedging and talk I got him to alter his 	letteras shown. I cannot help feeling that he is funking his 	so-called “contemplated fast” on the 2nd January and is casting 	round for any excuse to get out of it.  Yours sincerely,  E. 	E. DOYLE Home Department, Political, File No. 31/108-Poll., p. 30, 1932. Courtesy:  National 	Archives of India    APPENDIX VII  DISCUSSION WITH 	MACRAE  December 	12, 1932  GANDHIJI: 	I don’t think there is anything special I can say at the moment. I 	think, for the present, we should leave the question of wells. If at 	all I can say something, it will be about the fast. You may ask me 	about that.    
 MACRAE: What have you to say about the allegation that through this you impose your opinion on others?
 G. My answer to this question will also cover what you have said about the resolution concerning my fast. Shri Jamnadas Mehta has perfect right to make the criticism he has made. But I do not accept his allegations. I have never tried to impose my views on others. I have never imposed my views even on the closest co-workers. But it has so happened that, despite my having admitted that I have committed Himalayan blunders, my views on many things have been proved correct. For me the question of untouchability is forty years old. Ever since, I have been facing opposition on this score. It has come not only from outsiders but also from my family members—old and young. But the views I have been holding and putting into practice for the last 45 years have been commonly accepted. Today, if my sanatanist friends charge that I have been forcing my views on the public or on the sanatanists, there is not much substance in the charge. Looking at the history of mankind, we find that whenever an individual has held some good ideas, has insisted on them and put them into practice in his life, the whole society has accepted them. Now, to say that he has forced his thoughts on the people is absurd. So long as there  is no physical force behind one, it cannot be said that one has forced one’s views on others. It is true that my fast has evoked some anxiety. But I have no doubt in my mind that I am not at all to blame for it. I am carefully watching, with the eye of a scientist, the impact that my contemplated fast has had, and is having. What I see fills me with joy and hope. The fast has made people think. The fast will not force anybody to do anything against his conscience, but those who are lethargic will give up their lethargy and will start working with zest, that is, all those who love me will actively start working. I do not in the least feel depressed by this development. Those who feel that I am destroying Hinduism write angry letters saying I should quickly undertake the fast and depart from the world. Such letters do not have any effect on me. I am talking about these letters on]y to show that those who are opposed to eradication of untouchability will not be affected in the least by the fast which I am thinking of undertaking and it should be so. But about the fast, I will have to say more later on. At the moment I can only say that nobody would be able to deflect Shri Kelappan or me from the resolve to fast which has been inspired by God. I appreciate the efforts of Shri Mehta who has already warned the public beforehand. What causes me pain and surprise is the fact that the Zamorin is bringing all sorts of allegations against those who are engaged in organizing voting. I consider him to  be  a gentleman. He knows that Shri Madhavan Nair, who is the Chairman of the Voting Committee is a respectable lawyer, well-known throughout Kerala. Rajaji is helping the Committee and supervising the work. They are people who will not tolerate any unfairness. It is the Zamorin’s duty to point out if they have resorted to any objectionable means. This question is purely moral and religious. There can be no
 
 room for taking sides, for love and hate. If the sanatanists and reformers work together they will be able to bring out the truth. Let me once again assure you that as soon as I come to know that I am mistaken about the public opinion, I will immediately give up the idea of fasting. I wish to worship Truth only. I have no other aim than that.

 LETTER FROM SECRETARY, ALL-INDIA VARNASHRAMA SWARAJYA SANGH
 December 8, 1932
 We have to thank you for your prompt reply to the 6th instant.
 We note that you will be pleased to receive a visit from any sanatanist friends and that if they convince you of the error, you will gladly retrace your steps. Having regard to our letter to you of which this is a reply, we take it that you are prepared to retrace your steps if, from the discussion suggested by us, you are convinced of the error of your steps from the Shastraic point of view. The object of our last letter was  to know from you, whether you were willing to have an organized discussion on the lines suggested in our letter, in order to ascertain what is the truth so far as the Shastraic view on untouchability and restrictions on the temple-entry are concerned. From your letter, it appears that you are willing to have such a discussion. We never suggested that you should call such an assembly.
 After you definitely declare your willingness to have the Shastraic point of view investigated in the manner suggested by us, the work of calling together the assembly may be done by Acharya Dhruva of Benares on your side and by us on behalf of the All-India Varnashram Swarajya Sangh. We take it that after the investigation of the Shastraic view, your attitude would be in accordance with such a view.
 Your division of the Shastris into no-change Shastris and pro-change Shastris is not relevant to the present discussion, as our common object is to find out the truth as regards the statement that untouchability and restrictions on untouchables’ temple-entry have no Shastraic basis.
 As regards your assurance that no coercion is intended by you by your fast, please allow us to tell you the well-known maxim of law that a man is presumed to intend the consequences of his own acts.

 EXTRACT FROM T. CHINNIAH’S LETTERlibtech_824_footnote
 December 9, 1932
 “.	You say the Poona Pact is much better than the Award for it gives more
 seats. I wish to inform you that it is not the quantity that is important but it is the quality. The Award gives 18 seats by separate election, voting power in the general election, and seats if liked by the Depressed Classes and allowed by the caste people in the general electorate. The Pact gives only 30 seats in the general electorate. . . .
 In the words of Dr. Ambedkar according to the Premier’s Award we will send to the Councils 30 diluted (in Madras). Secondly by the Award the so-called high class people would beg of the Depressed Classes to give them votes by which the pride of the high caste people will be suppressed. . . .
 You say the Poona Pact “provides  against  the  election  of  any  candidate  who  is  not  in  the  first  place  approved  by  the  majority  of  Harijans”.  I   know  you  are  referring  to  the  Primary  Election  and  its  panel  is  four.  I  hope   you would realize dear Mahatmaji that there is difference in confidence which each member in the panel enjoys among the Depressed Classes. Suppose in the Primary Election ten people contest. The first man secures 5,000 votes, the second 2,000 votes, the third 1,000, the fourth 900, the fifth 800, the sixth 700,       the eighth 600, the
 ninth 590, and the tenth 500. All these people enjoy the confidence of the Depressed Classes but there is difference in the confidence.       If the panel is six, the first six
 would be approved by the Depressed Classes, and if the panel is eight, the first eight would be approved by the Depressed Class. But don’t you see there is vast difference between each man? After the Primary Election the selected candidates would have to stand in the joint electorate (I know the mentality of the caste people), and the result  is the last man in the panel would be elected by the caste Hindus. The caste people would elect a man who possesses the least confidence among the Depressed Classes so that he may be subservient to them.
 On 9-3-31 [I] wrote you a letter requesting you [to] stay in a paracheri (i.e., the place where the Depressed Classes live) whenever you visited Madras so that you may learn at first hand the difficulties of my people but you took up your residence in the palatial buildings of the Brahmins at Mylapore. If you had listened to my words, you would never have spoiled the Premier’s award.
 You say “I am certainly not in favour of special electorates for the merchants, landlords, and others. Then why don’t you fast for their abolition; is it because that
 
 your fast won’t have any effect over the merchants and the landlords ?
 Dear Mahatmaji, though the Poona Pact has been signed by the M.L.C.[s] yet the people of this Presidency are against it. They want at least the panel in the Primary Election should be two and not four. I request you to consent to the panel being two. . .”

 LETTER FROM RAMTARAN MUKHERJIlibtech_825_footnote
 December 6, 1932
 I humbly beg to approach you as the greatest man of India, nay of the whole world, in view of the fact that you claim to be a sanatanist.
 You know that Dadhichi gave up his bones for the benefit of the Devas, when they asked for them, but you are going to lay down your life without the asking. You know that Jesus was crucified under a decree of the then authority. You know that Socrates drank a cup of poison under certain decree of some sort of authority, but in your case, no such decree comes your way to obey. Under the circumstancesis it justifiable to lay down your valuable life without fulfilling the plainest duty of convincing the sanatanists that therefore they are in the wrong in not following your ideal?
 Your ideal is lofty. But you cannot expect that the faith, conscience, and call from within of an ordinary row of sanatanists are similar to yours. Had it been so, all the sanatanists would have been transformed into so many Mahatma Gandhis. Therefore is it not just and fair and proper for the present conditions of mentality, to descend from the ideal, which is your own, to common, practical and realistic ground, with a view to enlighten and convince the sanatanists, with  your  sweet reasonableness? Please consider how Bhagwan Shankaracharya defeated the Bouddhas and drove them out of India by force of reason, etc. Please consider how Mahaprabhu Shri Chaitanya Deb succeeded in conquering the hearts of people by propagating the religion of love. But you have not yet launched any propaganda to convince the sanatanists that the old order of the sanatanists must be changed in a suitable manner, yielding place to new order of things and that the Shastras should not be thrown in the Ganges water, but according to the interpretation of Shastras the sanatanists must swallow the pill however bitter it may be. We admit that Bhagwan Shankaracharya had not had the occasion to refute the Christian and the Mohammedan religion. He
 
 refuted Jain, Bouddha, Sankhya, Vaisheshik, Bhagavat and other persuasions. But now we have come in contact with democratic civilizations of the West, which we cannot ignore. On the contrary, we must consider how far varnasrama religion should be modified, so as to meet the pressing demands of the modern times.
 I, therefore, earnestly pray that you will kindly take up the propaganda of enlightening and convincing the sanatanists in right earnest and in your own way and till then you should do well to abandon the idea of self-immolation.’
 Yours sincerely
 RAMTARAN MUKHERJI VEDANTATIRTHA

 I humbly beg to inform you as, although I am an orthodox Hindu,
 we have removed the ban of untouchability, if Harijans think fit to be pure in body and dresses.

 LETTER FROM C. RAJAGOPALACHARI
 CALICUT,
 [December 12, 1932]libtech_826_footnote
 I do not quite like the change of name you have agreed to for the League. ‘Servants of Untouchables Society’ is good in itself, but it means a continued recognition of untouchables as such. ‘Servants of India’ or ‘Servants of Bhils’ or ‘Servants of God’ are all right because ‘India’ must be there, ‘Bhils’ is a race name and not a name implying inferiority, and ‘God’ is always there. But ‘Servants of Untouchables’ or ‘Servants of Slaves’ would not be right if we intend to abolish untouchability or slavery. Suppose the American abolitionists had a league called ‘Servants of Helpers of Slaves’. It would not have expressed the object. Of course the Society may close down when the institution of slavery or of untouchability is abolished. But the argument is not right, for it is the abolition in the psychology of men that is wanted at once. You would have to say ‘Servants of Untouchables so-called’ which is cumbrous and in reality open to the same objection. I would have liked ‘Untouchability Abolition League’ or (Society) . . . As a matter of fact, I did not
 
 like ‘Anti-Untouchability’ as a phrase. It is so barbarous. ‘Untouchability Abolition Society’ would be further a literal rendering of the names already in use in Hindi, Gujarati and other Indian languages without any objection. It is really abolition of a slave status and the phrase ‘Abolition’ would be suggestive and emphatic, as ‘prohibition’ has come to stay in connection with drinks and drugs. Service to a group of men is not really the object and aim, if we think about it. It is really the doing away with the evil. There is a school of thought which would keep the segregation, and asks us to do all we can to make them live and eat more comfortably. This is not all we want to do.

 APPENDIX XII
 DISCUSSION WITH UNTOUCHABLES’ DEPUTATION
 December 15, 1932
 QUESTION: There is no mention of Dr. Ambedkar’s letter in the report of the Anti-Untouchability League.
 GANDHIJI: Your complaint should be that the issues raised in it were not considered. You let me know your complaint against me. I will tell you in what ways I am helping you.
 Q. You said to Devrukhkar: ‘Win these people through love.’ But there should be love in him in the first place.
 G. Then you reverse the thing, and you win him through love!
 Q. No, no; he is as big as the Gaurishankar mountain. No doubt, we can fight him, but there is a limit to our violence too.
 G. I firmly believe that factionalism should be avoided. I will try my level best to remove this tendency among caste Hindus.
 Q. What about giving some social privileges to them?
 G. This is going on in all the Provinces. People are being made to understand and there is no laxity about it. Go to Malabar and see what a great change has taken place.
 Q. But what  plan do  you  have  for  the  betterment of  this  section  of  society ?
 G. It is precisely for this that I have raised the question of temple-entry. Sanatanists have got frightened because of it. They tell me, ‘You do everything else, let them take water from the wells; but please don’t touch the temples.’ This is just the first step. When the work progresses, other problems also will be solved. There is a lot of propaganda work to be done as regards temple-entry. And this work is already
 going on proper lines in Malabar.
 Q. To remove the sufferings of the untouchables and the hardships inflicted on them by the touchables, please appoint a committee of lawyers to find a remedy.
 G. We shall use the services of volunteer-lawyers.
 Q. Volunteers will not be able to do much.
 G. Even if they are like me?
 Q.  They  [untouchables]  should   be   admitted   in   the   weaving   department of the mills. Today there is untouchability in eating-houses and in the matter of water-taps. It is there  in the tea-stalls of  Majoor Mahajan. Why don’t you  suggest to the Chamber of Commerce that they should take casual labourers from among the untouchables? Is there any change in your views regarding the four varnas?
 G. I am afraid, no. I do believe in the four varnas. There should not be any restrictions regarding inter-marriages and inter-dining. There is nothing in the Shastras that says that different varnas cannot inter-marry. I have put this into practice in my life, but at present I do not want to propagate it. If I take up the programme of reforming the castes, my work regarding eradication of untouchability would suffer. All occupations should be hereditary. Millions of people are not going to become Prime Ministers and Viceroys. Moreover, so long as ashrams dharma does not revive, varna dharma too is not going to revive.
 Q. To what extent can we consider you as our man?
 G. Since before Ambedkar was born, I have been your man. You will find all the things that he advocates in my old articles. Nobody has opposed untouchability in such strong language as I.
 Q. That is what the Editor of Bhala also claims?
 G. Everyone who makes the claim honestly can do so. But, as Solon said, a man should be given a certificate only after his ashes cool down.libtech_827_footnoteWho knows I may not prove to be the worst sanatanist!

             MY 	DEAR BAPU,  APPENDIX XIII  LETTER FROM G. 	D. BIRLAlibtech_828_footnote         December 	21, 1932 
  I 	 have  your  typed  letter 	 with  its 	 enclosures.  Dr. 	  Roy   had   already   sent 	to me a 	copy of 	his letter 	to  you, 	and now with 	your reply to  the 	same I  have 	got the full 	correspondence with 	me. I should 	not like to 	waste your time over this 	matter any 	more, yet I cannot 	resist my inclination 	to write 	as I 	feel. Your mistake 	was somewhat 	of a 	different nature from 	the one as understood 	by you. 	There is no 	question of 	my being placed in 	an awkward position. 	If you  put  me  even  in 	 a more awkward position, you can do so with pleasure. But even now 	I do not agree with you 	that your mistake was 	confined to 	over-rating your 	influence withDr. Bidhan. In 	fairness to 	Dr. Roy, 	I must 	say that 	he could 	not have 	helped feeling hurt. To 	my mind, 	the mistake lay 	in the 	fact that Sureshbabu and 	Satisbabu being 	more closely associated 	with you, you 	should have helped Dr. 	Roy in securing the former’s co-operation 	instead of asking 	the latter 	to resign 	simply because your nearest friends 	would not 	give their co-operation 	to Dr. 	Roy. I may 	admit that 	Sureshbabu and Satisbabu 	had good 	reason to withhold 	their co-operation, yet I 	think you 	should not 	have chosen Dr. 	Roy for sacrifice. This, 	in my opinion, 	was your 	mistake. And I 	felt surprised when 	I saw 	your first letter to 	Dr. Roy, as 	constitu-tionally you 	are almost incapable 	of making 	such mistakes. 	We are 	so much 	dazzled with 	your superhuman 	personality that we 	have almost 	lost self-confidence 	in ourselves. 	The result 	is that 	whenever I 	feel doubtful about your 	actions I console 	myself with an 	explanation that 	the fault 	may be with 	my own capacity 	to understand 	the implication 	of your 	decision. So it was 	in this 	case. I still 	feel that in your 	last reply to Dr. 	Roy you should not 	have rebuked him, if I 	may use the word, for misunderstanding your letter. I hope I am not 	wasting your time. I 	am writing all 	this for 	my personal 	satisfaction and you may 	write to me if you think it at all necessary to do so.  As 	regards the definition, as you know in such matters I worry little. 	But your latest definition seems to be the best of all those 	discussed previously. As regards the complaint of Dr. Ambedkar’s 	friends that we did not give serious consideration to the Doctor’s 	letter, I think it is made under some misapprehension. Like Dr. 	Ambedkar’s suggestion, there were many other suggestions before us 	which required to be considered and embodied in the Blue Pamphlet. 	But we decided not to discuss the Blue    
 Pamphlet at all in such a big meeting and therefore appointed a small committee of three to discuss and revise the Blue Pamphlet in the light not only of suggestions by Dr. Ambedkar but of many other criticisms which may be received from the Provincial Boards and other members. But I confess that our Secretariat is not so efficient as it ought to be. Poor old Thakkar is wandering from place to place and in the absence of a capable Secretary at the Head Office the work is, undoubtedly, suffering. Before we started this Society, Devidas had promised to help me, but he seems to be occupied with other work. In fact I made a grievance of it to him when I met him yesterday. But  he has promised to get me a good man. As it is, I told him, the work must suffer. I myself can get a good man, but you know, my getting a good man means payment of so much money. I can get a man only on the market value. What is required in such societies is a man who wants to undergo self-sacrifice. I wonder, therefore, whether you could help me. If he can take charge of the work Devidas can do wonders, but unfortunately he is not coming.
 We are issuing the Journal about the beginning of January and I am expecting  a contribution from you (I have got it just now.). Viyogi Hari has been appointed to edit the Hindi Journal. I do not have a good man just now to look after the English Journal and so I am utilizing our office staff to do the work. But as you will realize all this requires the services of a good secretary and I must have one.
 About the name of the Society, I am afraid it would look ridiculous to change it for the third time. Rajaji’s letter although it impressed you so much did not make an impression on me. But probably it is due to the fact that I look upon all these things with some indifference.
 I hope you are quite fit.
 Please do not worry about my health. I am just all right. I have not tried the prunes. I propose to do so.
 Yours affectionately,
 GHANSHYAMDAS

 APPENDIX XIV
 DISCUSSION WITH NATARAJAN AND DEVDHAR
 December 18, 1932
 NATARAJAN: What you tried to avoid in England is taking place here. There is a big gulf between the sanatanists and the reformers. It is necessary for you to come out to stop our society from disintegrating. I strongly feel that you should come out  to conduct this movement. To use your own words, you have to stand surety to stop
 
 this fight. But I do not know how you can come out.
 G. Nor do I. There should be no restrictions on those who want to do only this work. Those who are in jail can also go out saying that they will confine their work only to the eradication of untouchability. But whether or not they should do this, I cannot say. I cannot even say that I would like their doing so. But it is not that anyone who gives up civil disobedience will cease to be my co-worker and will become less dear to me. Suppose I am released unconditionally, it is possible I may advise people to give up civil disobedience. But today I would not like to bind myself by any such condition.
 N. Is it not possible to postpone civil disobedience for the time being?
 G. We can think over it after I am unconditionally released.
 N.  I  cannot  ask  you  for  an  assurance  of  any  sort.  But   when   you   say that you have devoted your life to this work, it means that you will leave all other work and will concentrate only on this. You do not wish society to be divided. You want the caste Hindus to accept the Harijans as their own. The caste Hindus as well as the opposition both have faith in you.
 G. We can certainly prevent division.
 DEVDHAR: Bitterness can be removed if certain matters are cleared
 up.
 G. I am not afraid that society will be divided. There may be some bitterness
 regarding Guruvayur, but I have kept that matter separate from all others.
 D. If we go step by step, the sanatanists will join us.
 G. They certainly will. That is why I have laid down so many restrictions with regard to other temples. But if there is laxity in securing the Viceroy’s permission, I will have to undertake the fast.
 N. But it will take two months to obtain that because the Bill would remain with him for two months.
 D. Why don’t you write to the Government that those who say that they will work only for the eradication of untouchability should be released? You must also make it public that those of your followers who devote themselves exclusively to this work will not, on that account, become less dear to you.
 G. I cannot tell them to take up this work instead of going to jail. In that case,   I myself should first come out by giving such an assurance. Only then I can tell others to do so.
 D. If you really feel that this work requires the whole of your lifetime, you can come out without any sort of mental hesitation.
 G. No. If I really felt the need for it, I would have written to the Government long ago. Today, it is my firm belief that if I go out in this way, I shall lose all the
 strength for work.
 D. Is it because people consider you a political leader?
 G. No, people see me as a whole, for what I am. They know that politics is only a part of my service to them. They have instinctively understood that my whole life is for the service of the people. This is a question of mental justification. The moment I go out, I shall start wondering what to do in this calamitous situation. It is possible I may think only of civil disobedience and nothing else. I am fully satisfied that I am able to do this work even from here.
 D. Try to find some way so that you are able to have these other people released.
 G. The way I have suggested should have an impact on the Government. The Government should itself understand that the whole nation is occupied with this work.
 D. Will you not say that this work is equally important and that workers should plunge themselves into it?
 G. Take for instance Jamnalalji. He should not go out on any such condition. If   I tell him to do so, he may agree, but I cannot tell him to go out like this. In this movement there is no need of old workers who are in jail. A new class of workers has emerged and I am happy about it. If Jamnalalji himself feels like going out, he can do so with my blessings. But I will not tell him to do so. Many prisoners meet me every fortnight. I have told them that, if they feel like going out by giving an assurance that they will work only for the eradication of untouchability, I will not say that they had done something wrong.

 APPENDIX XV
 LETTER FROM SECRETARY, ALL-INDIA VARNASHRAMA SWARAJYA SANGH
 
     DEAR 	SIR,  December 	19, 1932 
  With 	reference to your letter of the 16th instant delivered this morning, 	you will please not mix up any other discussion with any other 	Shastris whether 	from Pandharpur or from any other place with the discussion which we 	have agreed upon with you.  If 	you have fixed 23rd instant for discussion with Pandharpur Shastris, 	you 
 will please appoint some other day for investigation settled between us and after reference to the pundits who are to attend on behalf of the All-India Varnashrama Swarajya Sangh, we shall confirm the said date, if convenient.
 We have mentioned no terms regarding the discussion. What we said was that some madhyasthaslibtech_829_footnotewill have to be appointed and it will have to be settled what
 books shall be relied upon and the rules of interpretation will have to be settled.
 It is, therefore, absolutely necessary that you will please mention the names of any two gentlemen of experience, position and dignity to sit as madhyasthas and the names of the pundits whom you or Acharya Dhruva intend to call to support your statements.
 As soon as this is done, we shall mention the names of our pundits and the two
 madhyasthas.
 The duty of  the  madhyasthas  will  not  be  the  duty  of  the  Chairman  but  the duty will be to see that the discussion is carried on in writing in an organized manner.
 Our sole desire is that the discussion should be carried on in an organized manner as has been stated to you in the very beginning and not merely a fruitless discussion.
 As has already been settled in the correspondence, the  objects  of  the discussion would  be  to  investigate  and  find  out  the  truth  whether  untouchabi-  lity is enjoined by Shastras and whether there are restrictions in Shastras on untouchables’ temple-entry. We take it that if it is done and the pundits whom you call are unable to support the view hitherto propounded by them, you will retrace your steps.
          M. 	K. GANDHI, 	ESQ. 	C/O YERAVDA 	PRISON 	POONA  Yours 	truly,  HIRALAL 	D. NANAVATI 	SECRETARY, 	A.I.V.S. SANGH

                    MY 	DEAR BAPU,  APPENDIX XVI  LETTER FROM G. 	D. BIRLAlibtech_830_footnote          BIRLA 	HOUSE, 	ALBUQUERQUE ROAD,  NEW DELHI,  December 	14, 1932 
  I 	have received 	today the resignation 	from Dr. Roy. He 	has also sent to 	me a copy 	of his 	letter to 	you which 	he wrote 	in this 	connection. I 	am accepting 	his resignation. 	The more I 	think of 	the matter 	the more I 	feel that our troubles 	are not 	ended. Dr. Roy is not a 	quarrelsome man, and I hope he may forget the whole incident. But I 	doubt if 	his followers will so 	easily forget it. 	Besides I 	feel the 	public would not 	sympathize with Satisbabu and 	Sureshbabu, as 	in my opinion by 	humiliating Dr. 	Roy they 	have put themselves 	absolutely in the 	wrong. Thus 	your action instead 	of soothing 	the situation 	may cause 	a greater 	gulf between the various 	parties in Bengal. 	Satisbabu and 	Sureshbabu both 	being closely related to 	you, probably 	it would 	have been 	better for 	them to yield 	rather than wish for Dr. 	Roy’s resignation. This 	would have 	helped easing the 	situation. As 	it is, you have given 	Bengalis cause to feel 	that  it 	was a 	non-Bengali who 	could make or unmake 	Presidents of public 	bodies. This would 	surely be resented. If 	I werelibtech_831_footnoteDr. 	B. C. Roy, I 	would refuse to accept 	Presidentship under such 	circumstances. I, 	however, express these 	views just for your 	information and 	that of Satisbabu, 	if he is still 	there. Let 	me hope, 	this will end the 	trouble.  We 	are coming out with the first issue of our weekly on the Ist of 	January.  Please 	therefore send us your article in time.  Yours 	affectionately,  M. 	K. GANDHI, 	ESQ.  POONA  From 	a photostat: S.N. 18704               
  
 APPENDIX XVII
 EXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM C. F. ANDREWS libtech_832_footnote
 November 10, 1932
 The whole of my own religious upbringing has been such as to make any thought of suicide on my part impossible.
 I am really troubled still . . . such a practice as this will certainly be used by fanatics to force an issue which may be reactionary instead of progressive. Human madness or even doting affection may become tyrannical in this way. How far my anxieties and fears are mixed with weak human affection I can hardly myself understand. I do know that I saw you finally giving your life itself for the Depressed Classes, in your last fast, and I was glad—I saw in it the ‘greater love’. I can see you now preparing to do the same thing on January Ist, if the temple authorities do not give way.
 . . . It seems to me that I would very gladly lay down my life to remove ‘untouchability’, between the white race fanatics who call themselves Christians and the other races. But you have evidently come to the point of forcing the issue, literally forcing it, and I have to think that out in terms of Christ.
 I think He did force the issue, when He set His face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem. He saw then, I think, that only His own death could call the Jewish leaders to a halt. There is one strange saying of His, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.’ Again I am not sure whether His act in cleansing the temple was not of the same character, i.e., forcing the issue. But the method of fasting, committing suicide, still instinctively repels me.

  APPENDIX XVIII  DISCUSSION WITH 	K. KELAPPANlibtech_833_footnote       December 	29, 1932 
    fast.  KELAPPAN: 	When I 	 asked you 	to share 	my burden, 	I  said 	nothing about 	 the    GANDHIJI: Others gave what they could. What had I to give other than a fast? So 
  you 	should have known that I would be sharing your burden only in some 	such way. There is nothing wrong in this. The more I think over it, 	the more I feel that the     
 complications I have created were necessary. Hinduism is dying before my eyes. If I want to revive it, what else is there for me to do? You don’t know what is going on inside me. You must wait and enquire and suffer. If I have to fast, you must put up with it. For the present the fast is postponed. What the future has in store, I do not know. Maybe, fasting will be unnecessary. Or I may feel that to undertake a fast for Guruvayur will be foolish and a waste of energy. You will benefit from the confusion I am causing you. The questions which Rajaji asked yesterday have set me thinking and maybe my statement will take a different shape. But you should let the matter rest here and set to work at once. Try to understand the inner meaning of the fast, of the eradication of untouchability and of temple-entry. I feel that if we can get rid of untouchability the right way, it will be the saving of Hinduism. Otherwise, there is going to be a fierce fight between caste Hindus and the so-called untouchables. The untouchables will fight with violent rage and hatred and in sheer desperation will try to obliterate Hinduism from the face of the earth. They are not going to deny Hinduism. They are also not going to embrace any other religion. But they will deny God. This strife will be more fierce than between Brahmins and non-Brahmins because they feel the pain more deeply. My fast may prevent such a strife, though I do not know. Or it may not have any effect. But I did not go in search of the fast. I lay in bed thinking about an ugly decision of the Government and this question of yours came up before me and I plunged into it. At that time, I did not even know that it would call for a fast. You did right in acquainting me with all the facts. Other friends also sent me telegrams, which too was proper. Everything that has happened has been for the good.

 APPENDIX XIX
 DISCUSSION WITH MAHADEV DESAI
 BAPU: In a religious matter nobody should accept anyone else’s opinion as binding. One must rely on one’s own intuition.
 MAHADEV: Then we should not join in calling the Parishad.
 BAPU: We are not doing that. They are calling the Parishad on their own. I tell them that if they can convince me that I am wrong, I will admit my error.
 MAHADEV: Then we should not concern ourselves with whether or not the Parishad comes to a unanimous decision. You should merely say, you are keeping an open mind. That’s enough.
 Bapu further explained: Look at the man asking me why I do not challenge my opponents to a public discussion and defeat them, as Shankaracharya did. I tell him that  that  is  beyond  my   strength.  My   strength  is   of   a   different   character   and I am using it. How can I change my idea of dharma in deference to other people’s views?
