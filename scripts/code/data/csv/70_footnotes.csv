Any young man can mislead her. You became her husband instead of being a brother or father to her and did  obvious injustice to Ganga. Narmada could not even stand the talk she had with me before leaving. I keep on receiving laments from your brother, Ganga and Hemubhai. It is terrible if all that they write is true. And if it is—and from what you yourself write it seems to be— one shouldn’t be surprised if you were playing false with them. I know young men who feel satisfied that they have done their duty when they partially acknowledge their sins and if other people are not satisfied with it they get angry. They think that society is ungrateful to them. I wish you would not make such a mistake. Believe it that whatever I have written is for your good and for your guidance. You may forsake me but I do not forsake myself. So how can I do that with  you  or   anyone  else?    1 is not only a scriptural statement; it has been woven into my life."
