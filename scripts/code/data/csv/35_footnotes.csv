libtech_52_footnote,"1This  was  	Gandhiji’s  reply 	 to  the  addressee  who  	had  written   to 	  him about an article “The Change of Viceroys” in the Indian 	Social Reformer of 	April 3, 	which had stated; “Lord 	Reading hands over charge of the Viceroyalty to Lord Irwin today.   	The political situation today is quite calm, whereas when Lord 	Reading arrived   in the country, 	it was highly 	charged with distrubance. The 	Non-co-operation mov- 	ement was 	moving rapidly towards 	its zenith. 	Lord Reading, for several 	months after assuming 	charge of his 	high office, tried to 	come to 	an understanding with 	Mahatma Gandhi, 	but the latter 	was in 	an uncompromising mood. 	The prosecution of 	the Ali 	Brothers made 	conciliation impossible. 	The Prince 	of Wales 	was due to visit 	the country 	in a few months 	and the Viceroy 	strained every nerve to 	reach at 	least a 	tem- porary settlement in 	order to 	allow His 	Royal Highness’ visit 	to pass 	off quietly. 	He offered 	a Round 	Table Conference to 	discuss the 	next step in 	political advance and, 	although the late 	Mr. C. 	R. Das, who 	was undergoing 	imprisonment for breach 	of the 	notification declaring 	the Congress 	volunteers to be unlawful 	body, counselled accep- 	tance of 	the offer, Mr. 	Gandhi refused and 	great opportunity was 	lost. This seems to 	have convincd Lord Reading that the 	method of 	conciliation was 	not likely to 	succ- eed, 	and soon after the Prince left these shores,  the Mahatma himself 	was prose-cuted  and sent 	to jail.“"
