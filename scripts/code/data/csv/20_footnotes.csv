This letter forwarding the draft   to Kelkar must, therefore, have been written about a fortnight earlier. Moreover, for the greater part of June, 1920, Gandhiji was in Bombay as he mentions in the second paragraph. It would seem therefore that this letter was written about the middle of June, 1920."
