Mr. Gandhi may as well advocate the abolition of railways, aeroplane services and motor-cars in order that the bullock-cart may come into its own. The Congress Ministries have again and again professed their concern for the development of large-scale industries so that India may become self-sufficient and a committee presided over by Jawaharlal Nehru is functioning to evolve a plan of industrial and economic development in the country. One would like to know what the Congress leaders think of this latest pronouncement of Mr. Gandhi. At any rate, those engaged in the mill industry, which is at present the outstanding industry of India and specially of this province, are entitled to know whether the Congress Ministry, if and when it comes back to power, would work to attain the goal laid down by Mr. Gandhi of suppressing the mill industry of this country.
