(2) Which should be prefered from the point of view of the village industries programme? (3) Is not the need for uplift work greater in the British Indian village? (4) If the answer to 3 is in the affirmative, why should not all workers go to the British Indian villages? (5) Would not the Congress give any definite direction in the matter? (6) What standard of living should be adopted by the village worker? The villagers standard is far too low to be acceptable to the workers. You do not taboo milk and fruit for village workers. But villagers never get these things. How can a village worker conscientiously take them? (7) It is a fact that millions are starving. If we too follow suit, how are we to do work for them? And yet in a family a brother would share his loaf with a brother rather than let him starve. (8) What are the minimum necessaries  of life?”"

On the contrary, 	the consumers who  can  	easily  purchase 	cheap Japanese and other foreign stuffs, go in for khadi which is 	dearer. This   is 	patriotism and 	not exploitation. (2) 	The minimum wage may 	mean a 	few more 	coppers in 	the pocket 	of a very 	few, but what 	about the thousands 	who will 	find their occupation 	gone? (3) The spinners 	themselves would far 	rather prefer a 	permanent small 	wage than a precarious higher minimum wage. If a referendum were to 	be taken, they 	would cast their vote against 	the minimum 	wage. (4) We 	have not reduced 	the spinners’ 	wage; the reductions 	in our 	prices are 	due to the 	fall in the 	price of 	cotton, and 	reduction in 	the weavers’ wages. (5) 	It would have been 	possible to do something 	when the 	political situation was 	favourable, but 	at the present moment it 	is hardly the 	atmosphere.”"
