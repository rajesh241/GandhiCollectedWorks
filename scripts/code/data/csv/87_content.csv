 Pointing to his recent statementlibtech_18_footnotemade at the beginning of the San Francisco Conference, he indicated that India’s freedom was closely identified with the welfare of all other under-privileged peoples. At that time he had said:

18,"May 30, 1945",DRAFT FOREWORD TO “GITA ANI GITAI”,"
    
 I have quite a few co-workers who are more or less exclusively engaged in doing my work and who, therefore, have a claim on me. However, such a claim should not be made in so many words; otherwise I would not be able to do the work which I ought to do. Kundarji asked me to write a Foreword for Gitai ani Gitai and Gitadhyayasangati. How could I say ‘No’ to him? I agreed and so it became my duty to read Gitadhyayasangati and Kundarji’s Preface. This took away one hour of my time. The work will suffer if I let my hours go thus and the Gita will cease to be my spiritual dictionary.libtech_19_footnote
 The beauty of Gitai is that its meaning and music are renderedlibtech_20_footnotein Marathi in such a way that those who do not know the original Gita can enjoy reading it as they would the original.

 You wrote to me about Shashi’s marriage on the 13th May. I received the letter on the 17th. The wedding was on the 21st. You might have received the letter in time if I had written to you the same day. But I could read the letter only today. There is so much work. However, please do not feel bad. The marriage has been solemnized. Convey my blessings to the couple. I hope that they will lead a life of service and devotion.

 I 	could reach your letter of the 15th only today.  	I do not like to borrow money for Kashmir. The condition seems to me 	very strict. They refuse to give it for five years.

I don’t think it 	proper to say more to you in this connection. You must yourself 	realize your duty.  	Do not blame the zemindar if you want the fame which you can acquire 	with your money.

41,"May 31, 1945",FOREWORD TO “VARNAVYAVASTHA”libtech_34_footnote,"
    
 I do not have the time to read this book again. I do not even wish to. I have many other things to do.
 In my opinion a man daily moves either forward or backward. He never stands still. The whole world is moving. There is no exception to it. I will be making a wrong statement if I say that I am today what I was yesterday and will remain the same in future. In fact  I should not even have such a desire.
 It is right however that my writings and utterances should not be such as to confuse others. I should not write things which can bear two interpretations. That is to say I should always have an eye to truth and non-violence while writing, speaking or doing anything. I can say that I have been doing that ever since I gave my word to my mother.
 In fact I became a devotee of truth ever since I reached the age of understanding.
 This does not mean that I have had or even today have a full vision of truth and ahimsa. But I do believe that my vision of truth and ahimsa is becoming clearer every day. Therefore it would not be correct to say that my views on Varnashrama are the same as they were in the past. I have said that the varnas and the ashramas are the gifts of Hinduism to the world, and I still adhere to that view. But today neither the varnas nor the ashramas of my conception are in existence anywhere. They should form a part of our religion. But it can be said that these days the ashramas have disappeared altogether and varnas are found in the form of privileges. The claim of being a Brahmin, a Kshatriya, a Vaishya connotes pride. How can there be pride where there is religion? And the Shudras are not taken into consideration at all! Shudras are low and the Ati-Shudras are the  lowest of the low. This is not religion but a negation of it.
 Where are the four varnas of the Gita today? Varna is entirely different from caste. There are numerous castes. I know of no authority for caste in the Gita or any other scripture. The Gita has prescribed four varnas and they are based on one’s aptitudes and karma. I am saying four just to give you an example. There can be more or less varnas than that. But there prevails only one varna today,
 
 that is, of Shudras’, or, you may call it, Ati-Shudras’, or Harijans’ or untouchables. I have no doubt about the truth of what I say. If I can bring round the Hindu society to my view, all our internal quarrels will come to an end. That will also put an end to communal riots between Hindus and Muslims, and the people of India will occupy a place of honour in the world. Just as it is not dharma but adharma to believe in the distinctions of high and low, so also colour prejudice is adharma. If a scripture is found to sanction distinctions of high and low, or distinctions of colour, it does not deserve the name of scripture. One should approach the scriptures with the assumption that they would not say anything which is contrary to dharma.
 Caste distinctions have taken such deep roots that they have infected the Muslims, Christians and others. It is true that there are class destinations in more or less degree in all the religions, from which one has to conclude that that failing is inherent in every human being. We can cleanse ourselves of that failing only by pure dharma. I have not found sanction for such distinctions between high and low in any scriptures. In the eyes of religion all men are equal. An educated, intelligent and affluent man is no better than an ignorant, stupid and poor man. If he is cultured, that is to say, if he has been purified by dharma, he will utilise his education, intelligence and money in the service of his illiterate, stupid and poor brethren. And he will strive to give them, that is to say, the whole world, what he has got. If that is true of religion, then in our present condition, devoid of religion our dharma lies in becoming Ati-Shudras voluntarily. A man should consider himself not the owner of his property but its trustee or custodian. He will use it for the service of society. He will accept only that much for himself as he has earned with his labour.  If  that happens, no one will be poor and no one rich. In such a system all religions will naturally be held equal. Therefore all quarrels arising out of religions, caste and economic differences will be ended.
 At this stage it is also necessary to ponder over one further point. It is the foremost dharma of a subject nation to free itself of the bondage at the very first opportunity. A subject is compulsorily an Ati-Shudra. It is immaterial whether he has been given titles, or whether he is made a judge or a peon of a judge or whether he is a king or a pauper. The more titles one has the more abject is one’s condition under alien rule. Thus by correlating freedom with dharma and making the latter widespread, we shall in the natural course of
 things arrive at the state described in the previous paragraph.
 A man who wants to follow his dharma will not bother about the time when this may be realized. If many people do so, it will not only end our subjection but there will not be any anarchy or confusion in our freedom. This is the swaraj of my dreams. I yearn for that. I want to live for the attainment of it. I am devoting every breath of my life to that effort.
 The reader is therefore requested to discard anything in this book which may appear to him incompatible with my views given above.
 In order to save me labour, a friend who has digested my views and has done so with great effort, has sent me a brief note of my present views. Shri Kishorelal thought that I could save time if I could affix my signature to it. I was free to make any corrections I liked. But while going through it I found that Shri Kishorelal has, as is his wont, read through the whole book, has pondered over it and then has drafted a note as a testimony of my present views. Even if I cannot sign it, it should be published along with this. There is no incompatibility between his key and mine. Shri Kishorelal’s note is based on the study of this book and therefore it would be  more helpful to the readers.
May Truth alone triumph.

  	I got your postcard. You did not say where I should address this 	reply. When one is constantly moving about, one should indicate the 	address either at the top or at the bottom.  	Since Sushila has come after so many years, she is naturally very 	anxious to meet relations. Maybe, she does not,  therefore,  bother 	about the heat. I feel concerned about the children. I hope they are 	not over-strained. I leave for Panchgani this evening. There is 	bound to be crowding there. But I have provided for you two, 	together with the children. I am planning in my mind to  secure  one 	 more bungalow. However, since the breeze has started in Bombay it 	must be cooler now. All of you can spend a month in Bombay; the 	place will be cool enough. If 	possible call on Jairamdas once again.  	I didn’t read [the article] about Rajaji carefully. You should 	forget it. I don’t feel hurt by anything he does. He is acting 	according to his own lights. Everything that appears in newspapers 	is not true. You know my views. After all, what matters is one’s 	actions.

I   have   gone   through   your   Prefacelibtech_35_footnoteor whatever you call it. It is all right. However, 	I do not intend to write in that way. I will not involve myself and 	my readers in the controversy.  I will try to give the key for 	reading my writings. You have written on the basis of my writings, 	so it would perhaps be better if it is published as it is, under 	your name. I would, however, know about it    
 only after I finish writing.
 I understand about paricharya. It is like this. I have already written—haven’t I?—that words like men need growth. As knowledge grows, the meaning of a word becomes wider, which it should. Why should we stick to the meanings of the critics? Even then, what you say seems correct from the point of view of language. The pity is that  I am not a linguist and therefore whatever occurred to me on the spur of the moment, I wrote down. Enough, as it is time to go for a walk.

For the present, it will be enough if you concentrate on hand-made 	paper, hand-ground flour, hand-pounded rice, ghani- pressed 	oil, honey from live bees, hide from dead cattle and articles made 	from it in villages, village walking-sticks, village-buttons, palm 	gur, etc. As 	a matter of fact agriculture is a village industry, hence grains,     
 fruit and articles made from them can be village products. In short, when villages are self-contained, cities will be dependent on them.
 As you can see, the tooth-brush belongs to the cities,  while  datun belongs to the villages and is better; tooth-powder is of the city while charcoal powder, chalk or salt are of the village. When you become village-minded in this way you will find numerous village articles useful to you.

         BAPA,       June 	1, 1945   I have 	your long letter. It does not reveal your anger but your 
  	practical sense. However, the practical sense suggests that you 	should not relinquish the post you have accepted. I had often read 	in South Africa the letter Gokhale wrote on his return from England 	expressing his deep apology.libtech_45_footnotelibtech_46_footnoteOne 	of the sentences in that letter was: “How can I give up the office 	under duress when I have not accepted it under duress?” You are in 	a similar situation. The only difference is that there is no 	pressure at all on you. So it will be sheer cowardice to give up the 	post and with that the freely available opportunity of rendering 	service. The tongue that calls you a coward only condemns itself. 	Moreover, to give up doing service means putting a burden on  	Mridula, that is, on the women. Why should you do that? Give it up 	when I tell you and if what I tell you appeals to you. The fact is 	Mridula does not want to give up anything. I feel that we should 	leave only when she has become competent enough to enable us to give 	up.  	In the mean time, we should retain her and encourage her. The words 	of mine you quote are the only true words. She should not consider 	anything as passed by me unless it has received your independent 	approval. However, if she does not do that, you should ignore it but 	should do what you want to. About Rs. 2,000 I clearly remember 	having told her that she should not consider anything passed as long 	as Bapa had not considered and approved it independently. If she has 	employed two or three women, I would certainly be in favour of 	retaining them. But if you disapprove of it, I will do the same.  	I do not feel that you are giving me trouble. Whatever  the  trouble 	may be, it will end. I will see to it.  	What remains now is the question about the office. It is in a large 	measure in your own hands.    
 I will see what I can do about Bhavnagar and Kathiawar. It is good that Anantrailibtech_47_footnoteis here. Come here only if you want change of air and not to know my mind or to explain to me. Moreover, at the moment you want to work for Servants of India Society. You may gladly do that. I might, if I wanted, come to your help. But I do not want to do that. I have to curb many such good intentions. Enough for now.

I expect to decide about it here. Pattani the junior is here. I 	am sending Narahari to him. If it is necessary, he will see me. The 	money collected in the State should  be  spent  in  its  villages  	according to their share. The money will be unspent if the State 	does not allow us to do that. At the most the State committee will 	ask us to return the money. So our course is straight but the work 	is a little 
 confusing. If it takes some time, we can put up with the delay. There is bound to be delay where there is democracy. I do not see any harm in it. I hope all of you are well.

But, he added, he could do so only if he was allowed to work 	undisturbed.

He 	had been doing this work 	for 50 years.       
 This afternoon some young boys had come to see Gandhiji when he could not oblige them. They asked what was wrong with him. His reply was that he was 76 years old and was not young like them. That did not mean that he was an invalid. He had strength and that was why he was there for prayers and for Harijan work.

 June 2, 1945 Every Congress leader who comes to me tells the same tale (in regard to the Indian communists). I won’t build judgments on what
they say but the story produces on me an unconscious effect I would
 fain avoid. This is thinking aloud, if you please. I agree with L. in so far as he is concerned (in regard to co-operation with the com- munists). I disagree so far as I am concerned. For I have no difficulty in working side by side with communists. One must depend upon one’s own experiences.

It seems 	that you have not discussed the expenditure with Mridula. I had 	raised an objection as regards the training instructor. It is, 	however, considered that one instructor will not be able to deal 	with such a large number. The idea behind estimating the expenditure 	liberally is that if the expenses grow, we shall not have to ask for 	more. It will perhaps not 
 be appropriate to compare this with your experience of twenty-five years. My experience, not being of a Government department, is different. But let us not worry about it. Whatever goes to the trustees should be final from our side. It is better if you send your note to Mridula.

 I have a letter from Chi. Purushottam Gandhi. He writes that the students of the late Vishnu Digambarji have expressed a desire to set up a music college at Prayag. They want my blessings for that. I have written to them that you are also his student and I have already given my blessings to your scheme. Why then should I bless another? He writes to say that an attempt was made during the lifetime of Pandit Khare to draw you into their circle but they were unsuccessful.
 Chi. Purushottam was a favourite disciple of Pandit Khare. He is a true devotee of his guru. I have known some of the persons of that group for a long time but I came in close contact with you only recently. Please throw some light on this confusion.

Courtesy: Pyarelal         PANCHGANI,  June 2, 1945 QUESTION: To my mind one of the greatest problems confronting us at the present moment is that of combating the systematic plan of economic exploitation  by 	flooding the 	market with 	foreign consumer goods. 	This is 	bound to 	spell disaster 	to Indian 	industrialization whether small-scale or 	large-scale. And 	the pity of it is 	 that our 	own businessmen and 	industrialists seem 	to be vying 	with one another 	in becoming 	glorified agents of 	foreign manufacturers. Do 	you not think 	that an 	urgent need 	of the 	hour is 	the rousing 	of public 	conscience against 	the matter 	of foreign 	goods? I 	think constructive 	workers should take up 	this programme 	immediately. A 	countrywide propaganda 	for the use of 	village-manufactured and 	swadeshi goods can 	also prove to be a 	very elective 	and economic 	sanction against foreign domination. 	What is 	your opinion and advice? ANSWER: 	   The   difficulty   cannot   be   met	by	carrying	on  	propaganda, however wide and intensive. The first thing is to 	demonstrate its economic fallacy. Let us recognize that the 	industrialists are not conscious traitors. They honestly believe 	that their plan will bring prosperity to the masses. They are wrong. 	But how to show that they are wrong save by patient study and 	publication thereof and by working so as to show that the masses 	respond to the work and actually prosper?  	This demands hard thinking, hard study and harder constructive work 	among the masses. They have to manufacture for their own use.    
 Just picture to yourself every village producing and manufacturing everything for its own use. This must mean some surplus for the cities of India going from the villages. This means also automatic stoppage of all exploitation and prosperity without having to exploit the outer world.

MEHTABlibtech_60_footnote","
    
 PANCHGANI,
 June 1/3, 1945
 QUESTION: Do you think there has been any change in the country to warrant any change in the Congressmen’s attitude towards the war which they adopted in 1939? If you think there is no change, then has it not come to this that, in your opinion, Congressmen should not go back to  ministries  in  the  present circumstances?
ANSWER: You ask for my personal opinion. I give it for what it is
 worth. Mine can in no sense be an authoritative opinion. You should examine the Congress attitude not of 1939 but of 1942. So far as I am aware the Congress offered help in 1942 provided that certain conditions were fulfilled. It is for the Congress to lay down the conditions for the present acceptance of office. These must always be in terms of independence.
 
 
 There is no civil disobedience now and you have placed your manifold constructive programme before the country. Do you approve of the following definition of the constructive programme—to tackle the immediate problems of the masses and to try to solve them on non-violent lines as enunciated by you? This definition includes the work of trying to check black-marketing, profiteering and also the inflow of foreign consumer goods by insisting upon the use of swadeshi goods.
You have only a partial grasp of the constructive programme of
 my conception. It is comprehensive and all-pervading. Stoppage of black-marketing, profiteering and foreign consumer goods must precede construction. They are not part of the programme, but the programme to be effective and universal has to do that  weeding process. The whole programme is swadeshi.
 Would you ask Congressmen to seek co-operation from other parties and even from Government agencies in the prosecution of the constructive work? How can the constructive programme be prevented from being used for the purpose  of  consolidating the party position for elections and for other purposes?
I have been crying myself hoarse to persuade Congressmen to
 adopt whole-heartedly the constructive programme without party motive or any other. It is its own motive. I seek the co-operation of the whole nation and also of the Government in carrying out the programme, naturally, on our own terms.
 If the latter give honest co-operation, it must mean independence without violence and without fuss. If the constructive programme is worked for electioneering purposes it will carry with it the seeds of its own disease. Men can prevent vicious people from using the best things for the worst of purposes.
 What should be the attitude of Congressmen towards all those who are now building up an organization which may come in clash with Congress at some stage or other in future?
The Congress position should be of complete non-violent
 non-co-operation with those who will stab the country in the back.

Syrians and the Lebanese are a mixed population.libtech_68_footnotelibtech_69_footnoteTheir liberty is at stake not as Muslims but as a separate nation.

For instance the voice of Indian Christians speaking as Christians as apart from other Indians in international affairs must fall flat. This is the lesson of history everywhere, but in India, to my mind, the Khilafat issue emphasizes the lesson which we seem to have forgotten.
 The Muslims headed by the late Hakim Saheb sought the co-operation of all India and the Khilafat question became a plank in the National Congress. And it drew world attention. Had the history of victorious Turkey been written differently, India would have taken an effective part in the settlement of the Khilafat question. India divided against itself will have no effect on the council of the nations of the world.

  Gandhiji 	has your cable.  He 	appreciates your desire to have him in America.libtech_73_footnoteBut you have 	seen how he 	could not come. 	He could 	not force 	himself on the 	Committee. He 	has not much 	faith in 	the value 	of more 	verbal talks. He 	is trying to 	forge the 	message of 	non-violence through 	his work 	in India. 	If he shows 	visible success here the 	world will get 	the message 	it needs. 	Therefore the 	conscientious objectors 	who are going 	to meet 	near Glendora 	would do well 	to closely 	study what he has 	been saying and 	doing in 	India. Particularly, 	they should study his 	writings preceding 	and after the 8th August, 	1942—Resolution of 	the Congress.

I have not yet received the one 	regarding your work. Your 	health seems to have gone down considerably. Be careful.    
 Chi. Manu’s mind is wavering whether to go to Nagpur directly or come here for a day on her way there. If Dr. Gilder doesnot permit her, there will be no question for the present of her going to Nagpur. Manu is very impatient. Now she is obsessed with the desire to become  a nurse. Let me see what happens.
 As regards money, it is all right for you to keep it with you as Manu’s trustee. I see no need for two names. You may insert any condition you want in the Trust. If you wish, you may show the draft to me. I have no objection to your including my name in the event of your dying earlier. If you wish to select someone else, by all means do so. If you can get six per cent locally, you need not try to make any other arrangement.

 I got today the postcard written by you two. I am glad that grandmother has passed away. She has settled her accounts, but suffered much while doing so. The fact that she exacted service from you both earned you merit. But wasn’t that at her cost? One should not wish to earn such merit.

  	The Working Committee of the Kasturba Memorial Trust met at 	Mahabaleshwar. Your objection to keeping the entire fund with the 	Head Office was put up to it. I had told you that I would write to 	you and clarify the whole thing. You know that the fund raised in 	Bombay is kept in the Head Office. I feel that the same should be 	done with the money raised in Calcutta. The committee which is 	formed now is to consider how the money will be spent in the 	villages. Why should we argue over where the money should be kept? 	Your duty is to submit a scheme and if it is accepted, to get it 	implemented. You must be knowing that the committee for collecting 	the money and the committee for spending it are not the same. It is 	true that the same three persons are on most of the committees. But 	that  is  our misfortune. There are very few workers and those who 	give the money claim the right to have a control over the spending 	of it. When they are deserving, it may become our duty to have the 	donors on the committees. What more can I write? I would suggest 	that  you explainmy view to the committee and write a satisfactory 	letter.  Blessings 	from  BAPU [PS.] Hope 	you are well now.

BHAI BHULABHAI,
 
 June 7, 1945
 I 	have sat down to write this letter after the morning prayer, i. 	e., at about 6 o’clock. I saw your letter last evening.  	I am writing this with the sole desire that you should retain the 	eminent position you occupy. I hesitate to write because I  write 	without any official authority. There is a very big difference 	between yourlegal style and my own old-fashioned one or rather 	between your legal knowledge and mine. I am saying this deliberately 	and not through false modesty. I learnt while studying law and 	practising it— and I have always acted upon the understanding—that 	a lawyer,  having accepted the brief of an untruthful case should 	give it up as soon as he realizes its untruthfulness, that is, ask 	for a verdict against his client. I know that there is a section of 	the bar which holds the opposite view. They ask what the function of 	the judge would be if an advocate himself were to sit in judgment on 	his case. I have always held, and hold even today, that that section 	is mistaken. This is my own view. I find the whole of your argument 	unconvincing. It should be of no concern either to you or to me 	whether it is the question of League or the non-League Muslims. If 	the case of those who hold opposite views from ours is just, I would 	come forward to support it notwithstanding opposition from everybody 	else, but if a case is unjust  I would not support it even if it 	were my own son’s. I also believe that Bhai Khuhro’s brief 	should not be rejected merely on the ground that he is believed to 	be inciting the Hurs. But, if after having accepted his brief and 	studied it, I felt that he was guilty, my moral sense would teach me 	that, if permitted by the client, I should plead guilty and take the 	punishment. But if he should not permit me, I would request him to 	release me and engage another lawyer. I remember having done that 	for two Muslim clients. In one case I asked for a verdict against 	the client and in another admitted the client’s guilts and got his 	punishment much reduced and ultimately had him released after he had 	undergone some years of imprisonment. I therefore do not hesitate to 	request you that if, after examining the papers of Khuhro’s case, 	you feel that he is innocent, you should fight for him, but if you 	feel that he is guilty, you should advise him to plead guilty or ask 	him to relieve you. This is but a suggestion from me. If, after 	weighing it carefully you do not approve of it, reject it. Do not 	look to the person 
 who has given advice; only think over the advice.
 As desired by you, I am sending your letter to Choithram. I feel that he should have written to you. I also believe that he should not have formed prejudiced views. But that is a characteristic not only of our life but of that of the whole world. We have observed that even the most balanced men have not been able to shed this weakness. Hence, do not pay attention to Choithram’s shortcomings. If you find any substance in his otherwise faulty reasoning, accept it. I have not explained to Choithram the argument I have put before you. I amenclosing a copy of the letter I have writtenlibtech_87_footnoteto him.

 You have assumed a fairly heavy burden. Learn to keep your eyes closed, while remaining awake, and efface yourself completely. If fortunate, you may even have a vision of God. In any case you will have guidance in the performance of your daily duties. Remember that a mango tree does not start bearing fruit in a day. Fix the tenure of office of the Manager, after which he can be changed. For the present let it be as brief as possible. Keep the accounts department separate and independent.

          CHI. 	BALVANTSINHA,      PANCHGANI,  June 	7, 1945 
  	I had a telegram from Chi. Hoshiari and then, yesterday, your letter 	came. My advice to Hoshiari’s father is that he should not try to 	take her away till I come and since he has arrived in the Ashram he 	should await my return and share the work in the Ashram, so that he 	will learn something, gain some experience and at the same time not 	be a burden on the Ashram. Hoshiari is as dear to me as she is to 	her father. If Hoshiari had felt dissatisfied I would not have said 	anything.But she is quite happy there, is getting education and 	making progress. The Ashram is not perfect, but it is not a bad 	place. It has not done any harm to anyone. Many have risen by living 	in the Ashram. Those who are good have never felt inconvenienced in 	the Ashram. Hoshiari’s father should therefore rest assured that 	Hoshiari will not be harmed by living in the Ashram. The rest when I 	come. Today I can but request Hoshiari’s father that if he cannot 	stay on there for a month, he should not take away Hoshiari with 	him. If even in spite of my letters it is decided that Hoshiari 	should go she should not go with her father but you should accompany 	her. I hope the affairs at the Ashram are going on well. We shall 	talk about the  servants when we meet.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 1962   "

 BHAI MAHTAB,
 I do not like what you have told the Press. If we must criticize Rajaji, it should be done in a straightforward manner. Do you want to serve or to appear in newspapers? You cannot do both simultaneously. In any case I want you to realize that I do not like your behaviour. This is only my opinion. You will do what you think is proper. As you have some regard for me, I thought it was my duty to write this much.

SAMUELlibtech_95_footnote","
            DEAR 	FRIEND,           PANCHGANI,  June 	8, 1945 
  	I had your letter of 25th July, 1944. Perhaps you are right that 	after this lapse of time it would not be very profitable to enter 	into a detailed discussion of the various points raised by your 	speech in the House of Lords.  	There is one point in your letter however which challenges a reply. 	You have adduced two passages from my writings in support of your 	remarks in the House of Lords that “When Mr. Gandhi called upon 	the British Government to quit India, he said it would be for the 	Congress to take delivery.” This, you have argued, connotes 	totalita- rian spirit in the Congress.  	I have seen the full text of the Harijan articles referred to 	in your letter. Copies of these are enclosed for easy reference.  	The passages cited by you are from the Harijan of June 15, 	1940, and December 3, 1938, respectively. You will not fail to 	observe that they have no relevancy to the point at issue. The  	Congress decision in connection with its “Quit India” demand 	inAugust 1942      
 is embodied in the official declaration of its President, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad to which I have referred in my last letterlibtech_96_footnoteto you. To that decision the Congress still stands committed and one fails to see what bearing my writings in Harijan have upon it.
 The fact however is that the quotations given by you are incapable of bearing the totalitarian interpretation you have put upon them. The British Government have often declared that they would gladly part with power if there was a body in India ready and fit to take charge. What is wrong in the Congress trying to qualify itself for that onerous duty? That it does not want power for itself but for the whole people of India is made absolutely clear by me in the course of the same article from which you have quoted. Here is the relevant extract:
 Its non-violence forbids the Congress from standing aloof and riding the high horse as the opponents say. On the contrary it has to woo all parties, disarm suspicion and create trust in its bona fides.
Is it not the normal goal of every party in a democratic State to
 aspire to convert the whole country to its view and to become its mouthpiece? Does not the party in power in the House of Commons take delivery of the machinery of administration from the outgoing party—its predecessor? And is not the formation of coalition cabinets under the party system of government an exception rather than the rule? Then how can the refusal of the Congress to sacrifice or water down its ideal for the sake of securing unanimity with other parties be called totalitarian?
 With regard to the second passage from the article  on  the  Princes it is only necessary to point out that it was the British Government itself that called upon the Congress to secure an agreement with the States, at the Second Round Table Conference. There could therefore be nothing wrong in its inviting the Princes to treat with it.
 The essential fact to remember in this connection is that the Congress has no other sanction except that of persuasion and self-suffering, any other being precluded by its creed. On the other hand, is not violence, euphemistically called physical force, the basis and backbone of the totalitarian spirit? If it is, and if you believe in
 
 
 my bona fides about non-violence and also of the Congress, youcannot accuse either Of the totalitarian spirit.libtech_97_footnote

 I was happy to read your letter. Dr. Krishnavarma is an obliging gentleman. He has kept you there at my request. I could not send you anywhere else. So far as I know, he is there not to fleece the patients. He loves giving this kind of treatment. In any case he doesn’t wish to charge anything in your case. I have pressed him to accept the expenditure he will be incurring on your account. I am glad that Manilal showed interest in your case. I am glad also that Manilal has taken the key from you and you have given it. I have told him that he has to pay all the expenses that may be incurred whether from your account or some other account. You need not worry at all. Do what Dr. Krishnavarma says. He is competent and I have full faith in him as regards your treatment. Remember that you had tried to commit suicide. God saved you. Now make up your mind that you will stay there and get well.

  	Pyarelalji has received your letter. Your English statements raise a 	big question in my mind. When you cannot yourself write  in English, 	what is the point of getting them written and then signing them? At 	the most do as Ba did. She narrated her anguish over Harilal’s 	behaviour to Devdas who translated it into English and gave it to 	the newspapers saying that it was almost a literal translation of 	what Ba had narrated to him. You must have seen it. Such writings 	will carry greater weight and with that the mother tongue will also 	gain in importance. I will go to the extent of saying that whatever 	ideas occur to you, express them as they are either in Sindhi or 	Hindi. Ultimately whatever is translated into English is as useless 	as fruit ripened artificially. I 	am all right.

 I did have that in my mind. Palme-Dutt is a well-known figure. He will be able to give a fight to Amery. Patellibtech_115_footnotelibtech_116_footnote, I do not know. Nor do I wish that too many Indians should stand for election. This is going to be an important election. It does not matter if he is defeated. If, moreover, I give in this case the same opinion that I did in Patel’s, it might be interpreted to mean that I am refusing to  support  him because he is a communist. I have no such thought in my mind. The distinction is worth understanding. If you do not follow it, ask me again.
 If you don’t wish to post the letter today, it may be posted tomorrow. It is more important that you should understand my idea.

165,"June 	10, 1945",NEED FOR KHADI EDUCATION,"
       From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         Blessings 	from  BAPU          PANCHGANI, 
  June 	10, 1945  	Soon after the khadi activity was started, the need began to be felt 	for the workers to have a scientific knowledge of all the processes 	of khadi production. Therefore, as early as 1927-’28 a school was 	opened in the Sabarmati Ashram to teach spinning and weaving. As the 	khadi activity grew and it became necessary to pay attention to 	other aspects such as making khadi attractive to look at and low- 	priced, the lack of scientific knowledge of the subject began to be 	felt more and more every day. A few workers were able, through their 	own individual efforts and experience, to gather many useful bits of 	knowledge. The tools were experimented on and improved. All the 	lovers of khadi know that the late Shri Maganlal Gandhi worked very 	hard in this connection. It then became clear that it was very 	necessary for every khadi worker to learn the science of khadi. I 	have from the very beginning emphasized this. I prepared a 	questionnaire about the various things khadi workers ought to know. 	In 1937, I also wrote three articles for the Harijan. In an 	article dated February 13, 1937, I wrote :libtech_124_footnote  In 	my opinion it should be made obligatory on every khadi worker 	engaged in any of the production centres of the A. I. S. A. to know 	the elements of this science. Following 	this policy, khadi schools were later opened. A khadi    
 school was opened by the Central Office [of the A. I. S. A.]. The syllabi for the “spinning workers”, “weaving workers” and “Khadi Prathama” were prepared and arrangements were made to impart instruction according to them. It was also hoped then that all the workers of the Charkha Sangh would join these schools by turns,and complete their training. In order to save workers from any kind of difficulties, it was arranged to pay them, over and above their regular salaries, travelling allowance and other allowances since it was thought that the workers would have to spend more on food in an unfamiliar place. One regrets however that the workers have not shown any increased enthusiasm for learning the khadi science.
 Now that the Charkha Sangh has taken up the new work it becomes obligatory on the part of khadi workers to train themselves in khadi science. Without that it will be impossible to carry on the new khadi programme.
 According to the new programme, the sales depots too will almost be like production centres. Not only that; after some time we intend to convert all khadi production centres and sales depots into khadi education centres. It will then be unnecessary to send workers to the schools for khadi training. We have to train in the science of khadi all the workers, new as well as old.
 Those in charge of the branches are therefore requested to scrutinize the list of workers to assess what training a particular worker needs and to make arrangements for such training to be given. Lists of workers should in this way be made and forwarded to the Central Office. In order to make the training obligatory, we should make the rise in salary dependent on the degree of khadi education possessed by the worker. We should also accept the principle that the khadi worker has to pass an examination. Those who fail should not be considered qualified. So long as we do not seriously take up the question of khadi education, how can we hope to succeed?
 I have said that if we are true khadi workers, we should have as much awareness, as much knowledge and as much alertness as is considered necessary for a member of the I. C. S.

  	I have your letter. I knew Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthilibtech_126_footnotelibtech_127_footnotewell. 	I had great regard for him. I have already given my view on the 	question of a memorial. You must know it. Go through it if you have 	not already done so. You can’t raise a memorial by constructing a 	building or spending money. A man thinks that having given the money 	he has done his duty. Therefore, in my opinion, it will be a true 	memorial to Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi if, at least in Kanpur, and as 	far as possible throughout India, Hindus and Muslims should unite 	and instead of cutting each other’s throats be prepared to lay 	down their lives for each other. If this comes about, let me know 	and then ask for my blessings. What is there in merely collecting 	money? Let me also know who are on the Committee? And what are the 	grounds for believing that what has not been achieved so far will be 	achieved now?  	I have seen the aim of the Memorial Committee. That will not make 	the memory of the deceased immortal, only bring ridicule to it. Two 	or three rich men can jointly put up such buildings, give jobs to a 	few persons and thus deceive themselves and others that they 	haveraised a memorial to Vidyarthiji. But I will regard it  as  a 	mockery.     
 This letter is meant for you and your Committee and not for the Press. This does not mean that I do not want to give my views to the Press. If you want, you can give it. My aim in writing this is to awaken you and make you do real work.

         June 	10, 1945  Gandhiji 	congratulated the volunteers for having walked down to Panchgani 	from Wai in spite of the rain. He was sorry he could not invite them 	all to theprayer hall. The hall belonged to a school. That they 	allowed him, a rebel, to hold a prayer meeting in their hall was the 	essence of the prayer. He knew that the volunteers did    
 not all pray. He had been in close touch with volunteer organizations in India ever since 1919. Yet he had not been able to make them prayer-minded. He had failed to create in them an enthusiasm for prayer.
 Again he had explained to them right from the beginning that a volunteer must always serve the people and serve them only through truth and non-violence. Yet there were very few men and women amongst them who had accepted truth and non-violence as their creed. He was convinced that real swaraj, that is, swaraj for the rich and the poor alike, could not be won except through truth and non-violence.
 They had just seen the end of a terrible war. It had made people doubt if truth really counted in this world. The Allies had won, but their victory had been the result of superior arms and superior man-power. He could not enthuse over it as a victory of truth over falsehood. At the same time he wanted to make it clear to them that a victory for the Axis would have been far worse. The Axis had accepted violence as their creed. The Allies had not done so. They at least paid lip service to peace and freedom, and truth and non-violence. It was true that their actions belied their profession. A major part of humanity today consisted of oppressed and enslaved nations. It was his conviction that, if India could win swaraj through truth and non-violence, she would be able to bring deliverance to all the other oppressed nations.
 Many of the volunteers were not clad in khadi. He had called the spinning-wheel the symbol of truth and non-violence and therefore also of swaraj. That was why it had found a place in the national flag. Therefore he exhorted them all to spin and produce khadi for their own clothes. Thus they would help to combat the cloth shortage in the country and help the naked poor.
 Lastly he asked them all to learn Hindustani. Hindustani was the language that Hindus and Mussalmans of North India spoke and which was written in Nagari and Urdu scripts. All those who spoke Hindustani did not know both the scripts. But those who wished to serve all should make it a point of honour to learn both the scripts.

BHULABHAI DESAIlibtech_129_footnote","
    
 June 11, 1945
 Considering all that is happening around us, I see danger in this partnership with the League.
 One thing is definite, namely, that until the members of the Working Committee are freed and can express their opinion, nothing can be done in the name of the Congress.
 It is also definite that if the Chimur-Ashti prisoners and other such prisoners are hanged, the situation will become  impossible. Unless the League’s attitude shows a change without any expectation of gain I will have no deal with it even if the Congress Working Committee consents. This is for you yourself to think over  and  decide. You are in a better position to understand the truth than anybody else.
 The distinction that is being made between the League Muslims and the others seems to me dangerous from every point of view. I don’t think it safe to countenance any such position. Think carefully over what you said last night regarding this.
 Will the 40 per cent Congress quota include any representatives of the Hindu Mahasabha or of Harijans? What about the Sikhs, Parsis, Christians, etc.? Whether you have discussed this with the League or not is irrelevant here. When the time for final decision comes, the Congress will have to consider all these points. The Congress will not be in the same position as the League. It will have to take into account all the interests in the country, whereas the League is concerned with the interests only of the Muslims supporting it. You will have to be ready to face all these complications. You will definitely not be able to bring the ship to port by disregarding the parties other than the  League.
 Please understand my limitations fully before you proceed further. As I have explained, my temper is progressively becomingmore uncompromising. I use the word “uncompromising”
 
 in a good sense, so take it in that spirit. Against my indifference to the Parliamentary scheme and my increasing faith in non-violent non-co-operation, you can safely place my loyalty to you. It will not let myself go beyond the limits of what I have given you in writing. But it is difficult even for me to say where my uncompromising spirit will take me, for I am coming to put ever increasing faith in the Unseen Power and, therefore, I think very little about tomorrow.
 I started writing this before 6 and it is 6.30 now. I will write more if anything occurs to me. Otherwise take this as fully representing my views.

176,"June 12, 1945",TWO POSERS,"
    
 [On or before June 12, 1945]libtech_132_footnoteShri Sailendra Nath Chattopadhyaya of the United Press puts the following posers before me: “Why do you wish to live for 125 years,
and what is Ram Rajya?”
 The questions are so apt and reasonable that, contrary to my wont these days, I want to answer them. Many visitors and correspondents put the same questions. I take this opportunity  therefore and once for all, I hope, of answering them to the best of my ability.
 The idea of 125 years’ life flashed across my mind, while I was speaking on the 8th August, 1942, to the meeting of the A.I.C.C. in Bombay. I might have mentioned the same thing before in private conversation. If I did, I have no recollection. I am a constant student of the Ishopanishad which contains only eighteen mantras. The first half of the second mantra means: “Only doing works of service on this earth, you should wish to live 120 or 125 years.” The word in the original denoting the number is translated by the word ‘hundred’, but  I had seen just then a com-mentary which took the number to mean 120 or 125. I purposely used the highest figure at the meeting, as signifying the intense wish to live the longest in order to fulfil my allotted work. In expressing the wish I only followed my old habit of wishing to act according to the best of my belief.
 Moreover, as a naturopath, I believe in the feasibility of living the full span of life. I know that, medically speaking, the chances are against me for I have not always followed nature’s way. I began to adopt it fairly strictly in South Africa in 1903 or there about. Want of brahmacharya in early married life must also weigh against the full span.
 My conception of nature cure, like everything else, has undergone progressive evolution. And for years I have believed that, if a person is filled with the presence of God and has thus attained the state of dispassion, he can surmount handicaps against long life. I have come to the conclusion, based on observation and scriptural reading, that when a man comes to that complete living faith in the Unseen Power and has become free from passion, the body undergoesinternal transformation. This does not come about by mere wish. It needs constant vigilance and practice. In spite of both, unless God’s grace descends upon one, human effort comes to naught.
 
 Conquest of passion—passion here does not signify animal appetite; of course, it presupposes full control over such appetite—is more difficult to attain. If it were otherwise, complete non-violence would be easy of achievement. With all my knowledge of, and effort at, non-violence, I have conquered my passion only to the stage of suppression. This involves great strain on both body and mind.  Subjugation is the real need. It does not involve absence of feeling. He who identifies himself with every living creature must feel for every kind of woe and yet remain unaffected by it. Action proceeding from such equableness is far-reaching, pervasive and quickest in its effect. Naturally, it is wholly non-violent.
 Difficulty of attainment need cause no worry. For, being on the right track leads one nearer to the goal.
 Thus, though I wish and even hope to live up to 125 years, what does it matter, if I die tomorrow? There is no sense of regret or frustration in me. And there will be no anguish in me over an early death.
 Nor does the wish imply slackness of effort, in view of the prospect of a longer life. The wish, to be capable of being fulfilled, implies readiness to leave this body without a moment’s notice. It connotes an easy fulfilment, from day to day, of the daily duty. All strain is an anticipation of death.
 Death does not mean an end of all effort. The Eternal Law which we term God will be a mockery, if death were the end of such an effort. ‘Hereafter’ is a mystery into which we may not peep. We should have enough faith to know that death, after life truly lived, is but a prelude to a better and richer life.
 Now for Ram Rajya. It can be religiously translated as Kingdom of God on Earth; politically translated, it is perfect democracy in which, inequalities based on possession and non-possession, colour, race or creed or sex vanish; in it, land and State belong to the people, justice is prompt, perfect and cheap and, therefore, there is freedom of worship, speech and the Press—all this because of the reign of the self-imposed law of moral restraint.
 Such a State must be based on truth and non-violence and must consist of prosperous, happy and self-contained villages and village communities. It is a dream that may never be realized. I find hap- piness in living in that dreamland, ever trying to realize it in the quic- kest way.

 ‘DILKHUSHA’, PANCHGANI,
 June 12, 1945
 DEAR SIR VISVESVARAYAlibtech_134_footnote,
 I got your kind letter of 6th instant with enclosures yesterday. I read the summary at once. The following questions occur to me:
  Have 	you or 	your collaborators 	enforced the ideas 	given in your 	brochure in a village 	or a group 	of villages? 	If you 	have, I 	would like full details with names, status and emoluments of workers, etc.  I 	seem to 	read a 	conflict in 	some clauses of 	the summary. 	Has not 	the present war 	shaken one’s 	confidence in 	the stability 	of the 	economic prosperity of 	the leading 	nations, and is 	not that prosperity 	co-existent with the 	deep and distressing 	poverty of large 	units of the 	same nations?  The 	tendency, according to 	the summary, 	should be 	to wean the 	villagers from 	their present practice 	and to 	teach them 	to displace 	their tools with 	“machine tools”, 	and handicrafts 	production with 	“mass production 	by the 	use of modern machinery”.  If 	I have 	read the summary aright 	and if 	it reflects the 	nature of 	the brochure, 	is it not 	an invitation 	to me to stop 	my “numerous 	activities” whose 	one object is 	to secure the 	maximum benefit of 	the villages in the minimum of time with the minimum of expense? 
 I have always marvelled at your zeal for and devotion to the cause you have made your own. But unfortunately our ways seem to
 
 be so different.
 As I am dictating this letter I am glancing at the brochure itself and I see that you mention in Appendix I, “hand-made sugar”, “hand-made paper”, “hand-spinning”, etc. There is some confusion somewhere surely or am I thoughtlessly and superficially genera- lizing?

           CHI. 	PREMA,           PANCHGANI,  June 	12, 1945 
  	I have your long letter. I have explained the ideal to you. You 	yourself can, by keeping it before you, answer all the questions in 	the same way as every student of geometry can draw a line by keeping 	Euclid’s ideal line in his mind. Now try to understand.  	I know the ideal, and I will, therefore, utilize the services of 	educated women only for the realization of the ideal. If necessary, 	I will pay them enough for their livelihood. But they will give more 	than what they take. If they do not, they will be of no use. If it 	becomes necessary to run a camp to train them as teachers, I will do 	so. Whether I give six months or twelve months or even more to the 	backward class women will depend on experience. Won’t it? I shall 	not bother about that, for, since they will be learning through  	thecrafts, they will be paying their expenses, or will be fit to do 	so in the shortest possible period. What 	if people believe that I have failed? My failure is not the     
 ideal. And how can a man who is progressing towards the ideal be regarded to have failed? Does the fact that you yourself, though you have lived in the Ashram, are not able to live up to the ideal prove that the ideal is impossible to attain or that you are unworthy?
 If the admission of uneducated women to the camp makes it impossible to run it, then it will be impossible to effect progress in villages. Even if it is proved that Acharya Bhagwat has failed or even if he shares your view, I will not be deterred. Our mettle will be proved by our making possible what seems impossible today.
 Sushila Pai is here. I will give her this letter. She will write further.
 And now the next point. I stick to what I told you concerning Bhulabhai. He is here just now. It is 6.40 in the morning. He will leave at 10. I don’t know that those who are in prison will be released. It will of course be good if they are. If people are angry with Bhulabhai, they should be angry with me, too. For he will not pursue his plan, which I know, if I disapprove of it. I do not believe what the members of the Working Committee are supposed to have said. And if they have in fact said that, they have done so without authority. What do prisoners know about conditions outside? According to my principle, they have no right even to try and know. And even if they differ from me, what does it matter? They will be free to do what they like after they are released. I have no right at all to vote. Am I not only an adviser? Don’t ever believe what the newspapers say. Of what good is it anyway? If I knew that I should die tomorrow, such knowledge of the future could only do harm. The same is true in this case. Yes, I will say this much: Bhulabhai does not know what the newspapers know. If so, how am I likely to know?
 How can I or anyone else say what I would do in certain circumstances? If you can guess about the future from what I am doing today, you may do so. I cannot do even that, for I am daily coming to realize more clearly that we ruin our lives by forming views about hypothetical matters. There is meaning only in what we do concerning what is actual. All else is meaningless.libtech_137_footnote
 Don’t you still know my limitations and my approach? Didn’t Kumarappa resign only after consulting me? Wasn’t I a party to the offer of military help in the resolution of August 1942? What does it
 
 matter if, while I do one thing, the others do the opposite and I let them? And what else could I do? I would tell you only this: that after having been with me for so long, and later staying away from me, you now behave as if you were still with me. Even then I would advise you to observe my actions and the views I express, think over them and then do what seems to you best, feeling certain that you will have my support in what you do. For I do not wish to make everybody like me. My teaching is that everybody should be true to himself. Anybody who has digested my teaching will never fall into doubt but will ever go forward.
Manibehn also is here. I have left the rest to Sushila Pai.

 It is good you gave all the details about Kamle. Bapa is not deceived but it seems to me that Kamle is deceived. He will be. In his condition we too would be deceived. We have arrived at only one conclusion. I believe that as long as he keeps indifferent health he can only be accommodated in the Ashram. He will be a burden if he keeps on falling ill. You were right in advising him to take meat. He can’t give up meat under compulsion. I will write to him in a day or two even if I do not hear from him.
 It is good that both of you have returned to Sevagram. I shall be very happy if both of you can keep well. I was about to write “then we have overcome the world”, but it would not be fitting. Why should we put so much value on the physical body?

            BAPA,       PANCHGANI,  June 	13 1945    	I have received a pile of papers from Mridulabehn. One of those 
  	is of course about her office. I am writing in that connection just 	now in the morning. I had forwarded your remarks about the office to 	her. She has raised an objection. It is justified. She says that if 	the minutes cannot be amended, then her office should really be 	shifted to Wardha for the time being. I have already expressed the 	opinion that it is not necessary to do so. She can keep her office 	wherever she wants. If this attitude is correct, and according to me 	it is, then it should be included in the minutes. If it is not 	included, then her office should be shifted to Wardha till the next 	meeting of the Executive Committee. It is clear to me that that 	can’t be done. And it should also be clear to you, because I have 	said that Mridulabehn can keep her office wherever she likes. We 	must accept that her demand to get that change or addition 	incorporated in the minutes is justified. If she raises her 	objection constitutionally, I as President cannot deny what I said 	in the Executive Committee meeting. I want to get the work done 	somehowlibtech_143_footnotebecause 	the main thing is that the work should be done. For the sake of 	truth it is better to incorporate the change, if Shyamlal has not 	already done so, and amend the minutes. Otherwise we should 	incorporate it at my instance when the minutes come up for signing. 	By doing so we can wriggle out of the constitutional requirement.    
 Otherwise I, as President, must say that it is not obligatory on the part of Mridulabehn to take her office to Wardha along with Bapa’s. If we do so, we shall not then need any more money for the time being because as long as another resolution is not passed, the office can be retained in the Scindia House without making any payment and she should manage with as many paid workers as there are today. We shall do as you want. The first proposal accords more with truth, while the second is more in conformity with the requirements of the situation.
 In order to enable you to understand the whole thing better I am sending you Mridulabehn’s letter even though it is marked personal. In this connection I have to raise yet another question. Do you in your inmost heart feel that it would be better if Mridulabehn gave up the office? If you say that she should not leave, then we should have some clear-cut decision in writing so that this confusion is cleared once and for all. Draw up a draft in accordance with what you have in mind or leave it to me and I shall make it and send it to you for modification.libtech_144_footnote"

  	I have your two letters. Give notice as you have suggested about 	your office. I do not see anything wrong in it. I have writtenlibtech_147_footnoteclearly to Bapa. I won’t stop his office being 	shifted to Wardha, but there is no need to take yours there. The 	women you have employed or had employed when I came there will 	certainly remain. The office is also there. Let it be there for the 	present.  	Remember your resolve that you would work with men as a woman and 	bring credit to the work. Have patience, do work with men and bring 	credit to yourself and to your work.  	You certainly did well in going to Mahabaleshwar. One should look 	after one’s health. It is surprising you do not know this simple 	thing. There is hidden pride in such an attitude. These are the  	immortal words of Narasinha Mehta: “I have done this just as a dog 	under a cart fancies himself shouldering the weight of the cart.”libtech_148_footnotelibtech_149_footnoteMy 	head spins going through your programme.  	You should not feel bad that you have to write to me. You have no 	choice since I have become the president. The source of unhappiness 	is in the situation in which such differences of opinion arise. I 	hope that too will disappear. Advertising 	provision of non-vegetarian food means inviting     
 indulgence in such food and getting involved in the controversy. It is our duty to make such provision but it is not our duty to advertise it. Even if you cannot understand this, implement it as an order. Perhaps I shall be able to explain it to you when the occasion arises. Or you will explain to me your view.
 I fear I may miss the post if I write to you about the other things on which you want my guidance.
 It will be good if you can go to Kashmir.

If I understand correctly what you write, 	you and other lovers of Hindi should welcome my new viewpoint and 	help me. But this is not happening. People in Gujarat are in a 	dilemma and are asking me what they should do. A son of my    
 own nephew and many others like him are doing both Hindi Prachar work and Hindustani Prachar work. This  creates  difficulties.  You know Perinbehn. She wants to work for both. But the time has now come for one of the two to be given up. If what you say is right, then the need for this should never arise. In my view, it should be possible for a person to be the President or Secretary of both the Hindustani Prachar Sabha and the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. That he may not be able to do so because the work would be too heavy is a different matter. And if your letter means, as it should mean what I also say, then there can be no reason for any difference of opinion and I shall be greatly delighted. I have gone through your statement that you sent me. In my view the Hindustani Prachar Sabha is doing only your work and therefore deserves your thanks. And you at least should become a member of it. I had requested you to be its member but you refused saying that you would keep out so long as Dr. Abdul Haq did not come in. Now my request is that if what I write is correct and if we both are of the same view, then this should be clarified by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. If this is not necessary I shall not insist on it. But at least it should be made clear that there is no difference of opinion about it between you and me. It is no light matter for me to get out of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. But just as I withdrew from the Congress
 in order to serve it the better, in the same way if I leavethe Sammelan it will be to serve the Sammelan, that is, Hindi, the better.
 What you call my new ideas are not really new. It would be more correct to say that I am now only putting into practice what I had said when I first became the President of the Sammelan and what I clarified further when I became its President for the second time. I shall decide finally after receiving your reply.
 Yours,
 M. K. GANDHI

  	Immediately on receiving Balvantsinha’s letter, I sent you a 	telegramlibtech_151_footnotelibtech_152_footnote. Hoshiari had said in her telegram that I should reply 	to you after going through Balvantsinha’s letter. I could not have 	received that letter along with the wire. Therefore I repliedlibtech_153_footnotelibtech_154_footnoteto 	Hoshiari imme- diately on receiving the letter and wrotelibtech_155_footnotelibtech_156_footnoteto 	Balvantsinha meaning it for you. Now I learn from your letter that 	you have gonehome disap- pointed. My advice was different. It is the 	same today, namely, that you should stay on till I arrive there and 	then decide about Hoshiari. She is not a little girl; she can 	realize her responsibility. She is also a mother. Whatever you want 	to do you can do only after persuading her. She is as dear to me as 	a daughter. She loves the Ashram. But I do not want to make you 	unhappy. I want to under-stand your view and then tell Hoshiari what 	her duty is. I hope that you received my tele-gram and my letter 	while you were still at Sevagram and that you have stayed on. If 	that is not so this letter will be sent to you at Khurja.      
 I would advise you to remain patient and not to try to command the girls and boys when they have grown up. Our duty loudly proclaims this.

  	The meaning of “It would be a different thing if you wished to do 	no more than what I had asked”libtech_164_footnoteis this: I had asked you to go there for two months. 	That was what I wanted. If you stick to that I cannot very well ask 	you to prolong the period, can I? Who will trust me if I go on 	increasing my demands in this manner? I, therefore, wrote to you 	that you must leave after the expiry of two months if you stick to 	my demand. Mirabehn on her own will not detain you, so the question 	won’t arise. Did I suggest to you that you yourself should draw 	her attention about the expenses there? If you want I will do 	that.Your decision about the child’s tumour is correct.

  	I have your long letter from Nagpur. As for Balkoba, all that can be 	said is that there has been no steady gain from parpati. Now 	we have to see how he can regain his strength. It will be good if he 	does not find it too hot to be taken back into the room.  	I still abide by whatever I wrote about railways, etc., in Hind 	Swaraj. But that applies to an ideal state. It is 	possible that we may never reach that state. Let us not worry about 	it. It is for this reason that I have said that if we do not have 	railways and other  such facilities, we should not feel unhappy. We 	should never make it our duty to multiply such facilities. At the 	same time we should also not make a duty of giving up these things. 	We should have a free and easy attitude in such matters. We must use 	these facilities as  little  as  possible. There will be all types 	of people in our society. There certainly are today. We have to live 	with them. Non-attachment is the only proper dharma under these 	circumstances. The only thing we must be careful about is that we do 	not deceive ourselves. Your statement that trains, etc., should be 	shunned even as theft, adultery and falsehood is not correct. The 	important reason for this is that even society considers theft, 	etc., to be immoral. Trains, etc., have not been, nor need they be 	so considered. All that we may say is that we shouldnot consider 	trains, etc., as means of enjoyment. I have repeatedly pointed out 	in my articles where to draw the line. Read them and if you give a 	little thought you will easily be able to draw the line. 
 Some small books have been written as an aid to the study of
 Das Kapital. Reading them would help.
 Do not worry about the discharge. You can stop worrying by intelligently observing the rules [of brahmacharya].

 All handicraft or arts which can be worked in village homes can be and should be taught even though the products of such crafts and arts may be and can only be profitably used for city people.
 Thus carpentry, joinery, drawing, painting, sculpture, brick- laying, scientific washing etc., have their proper place in the institute. These should not be taught merely mechanically. But the why and the wherefore should be explained to the pupils, so that their intellect is fully drawn out and disciplined in the act of learning and working the respective crafts and arts. Thus they should be educated morally and intellectually through these.
 Secondly, if the first is carried out to the letter and in the spirit, the whole institution must be self-supporting through the sales  of work turned out. For, in it there would be little or no overhead charge, the idea being to man the insitution from top to bottom through its erstwhile pupils, now turned experts in their respective departments.

PATELlibtech_178_footnote","
          PANCHGANI, 
  June 	15, 1945  	I have thought about your diet. I am of the view that you should not 	eat anything fibrous. Hence, among vegetables you should eat gourd 	and similar other things in which there would be very little of 	indigestible matter. The main diet should consist of milk, 	glucose,honey and, if you can digest it, butter. I think even 	vegetables with seeds such as brinjals, tomatoes, should be avoided. 	They have sent me from Coimbatore yeast made from bajra, which 	may be  good. The point is that you should eat only such food as 	will not impose a  burden on your intestines, and only a  small 	quantity at  a     
 time. It does not matter if you eat four times a day. You should have hip-baths, both warm and cold. Stretching your whole body in the tub may also help. This does not of course mean that the doctors should not exa-mine you or make suggestions. They give no thought to the problem of diet.

227,"June 15, 1945",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
    
 PANCHGANI,
 June 15, 1945
 On  the  purely  political  aspect  of  the  Viceregal   statementlibtech_179_footnoteI prefer to say nothing, now that the members of the Working Commit- tee of the Congress are free. I can only give them my advice and it is they who have to shape the policy of the Congress and speak and act with authority.
 As soon as I read the broadcast I sent a wirelibtech_180_footnoteto His Excellency the Viceroy drawing his attention to the fact that I have no locus standi as the “recognized representative of the Congress”. That function belongs to the President of the Congress or whoever may be appointed to represent the Congress on a particular occasion.
 For several years I have acted unofficially as an adviser to the Congress whenever required. The public will remember that I went with   the    same    unrepresentative    character    for    my    talkslibtech_181_footnotelibtech_182_footnotewith Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah; and I can take up no other position with the British Government, in this instance represented by the Viceroy.
 There is one expression in the Viceregal broadcast which certainly offends my ear and, I hope, will offend that of every poli- tically minded Hindu. I refer to the expression “caste Hindus”. I claim that there is no such person, speaking politically, as a “caste Hindu”,let alone the Congress which seeks to represent the whole of India which is yearning after political independence.libtech_183_footnote
 Does Veer Savarkar or Dr. Shyama Prasad or Dr. Moonje of the Hindu Mahasabha represent caste Hindus?
Do they not represent all Hindus without distinction of caste?
 
 Do they not include the so-called untouchables? Do they themselves claim to be caste Hindus? I hope not.
 Of all politically minded Hindus, I know that even the revered Pandit Malaviyaji, though he observes caste distinctions, will refuse to be called a caste Hindu, as distinguished from the other Hindus.
 The modern tendency in Hinduism is to abolish all caste distinctions and this I maintain in spite of my  knowledge  of reactionary elements in Hindu society.
 I can only hope, therefore, that H. E. the Viceroy has alloowed himself to make use of the expression in utter ignorance. I want to acquit him of knowingly wounding the susceptibilities of Hindu society or dividing it.
 I would not have dwelt on this matter but for the fact that it touches the political mind of Hindus in its sensitive spot and carries with it political repercussions.
 The proposed conference can do much useful work if it is put in its proper political setting and is at the very outset rendered immune from any fissiparous tendency.
 Undoubtedly all invitees might appear as Indians conjointly bent on achieving India’s natural goal and not as persons representing several sections of Indian society.
 That is how I have viewed Bhulabhai-Liaqat Ali understandinglibtech_184_footnotewhich I suppose laid the foundation for the forthcoming Viceregal conference.
 Shri Bhulabhai Desai’s proposal has no such colouring as the Viceregal broadcast would seem to have. I am not ashamed of the part I have played in advisinglibtech_185_footnotelibtech_186_footnoteShri Bhulabhai Desai when he consulted me about his proposal.
 Shri Bhulabhai Desai’s proposal, as I understood it, attracted me as one interested in solving the communal tangle, and I assured him that I would use my influence with the members of the Working Committee and give my reasons for acceptance of his proposal and
 I have no doubt that if both parties to the proposal correctly represent their constituents and have independence of India as their common goal, things must shape well. At this point I must stop and the Working Committee has to take up the thread. It is for its members to declare the Congress mind on the impending questions.

 DEAR FRIEND,"
234,"June 16, 1945",LETTER TO LORD WAVELL,"
    
 ‘DILKHUSHA’, PANCHGANI,
 June 16, 1945
 I 	thank you for your telegramlibtech_192_footnotelibtech_193_footnoteof 	yesterday received at 3.45  	p.m.  My  second  telegramlibtech_194_footnote,  acknowledging   your   kind   telegraphic 	invitation, evidently crossed yours. I am sending you this letter in 	reply, instead of wiring, because I am anxious that you should 	understand my position thoroughly. However, I am sending you a wirelibtech_195_footnoteintimating the despatch of this letter. For ready 	reference, I am enclosing herewith a copy of my Press messagelibtech_196_footnotewhich  was  issued yesterday in the morning. I 	would like you to go through it.  	While it is true that my position is technical, the reality of it is 	truer. My official and legal connection with the Congress was 	deliberately, and with the consent of the All-India Congress 	Committee, severedlibtech_197_footnotein 	order to enable me all the better to serve the common cause. This 	position therefore cannot be changed at will. In the forthcoming 	official conference, I can have no official position. My presence in 	it will change the official colour, unless I become an official 	representative of the Congress. But if you think that my helpis 	desirable and that without being a member of the conference I am 	likely to be useful, I shall make it a point to be at your service 	before and even during the conference proceedings, assuming, of 	course, that the Working Committee wishes likewise.  	I want to cite an analogy. You may have known the late Deenabandhu, 	as C. F. Andrews was affectionately called by us. He severed his 	official connection with the Cambridge Mission and the Church in 	order to serve religion, India and humanity better. The position he 	occupied as a valuable link between India and England, whether 	official or non-official and, between all classes and parties, grew 	as days went. If I can, I would love to occupy such a position. It 	may never come to me. Man can but try.      
 You have suggested further consideration and consultation, both of which I have done. I am within an easy distance of Yeravda Central prison, where Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Shri Shankarrao Dev were recently transferred from Ahmednagar Fort. Almost immediately after their discharge from the jail yesterday they motored to Panchgani and are still with me. I have shown them all the necessary papers and they concur with me in what I am writing.
 In the task you have undertaken, of which I fully appreciate the difficulty and delicacy, you certainly need the assistance and goodwill of all the parties. The Congress help you naturally cannot  have  without the Congress being officially represented at your table. The first and also perhaps the main purpose of the discharge of the remaining members of the Working Committee will be frustrated unless you secure the presence at your table of the President of the Congress or whomsoever he and his Committee may appoint for the purpose. If my supposition is correct, my immediate advice is that you should invite the President of the Congress. I expect that the ban on the Congress had been or will be lifted to the extent it still exists.libtech_198_footnote
 I am, Yours sincerely,

 PANCHGANI,
 June 18, 1945
 This is perhaps an opportune moment to release the text of a letterlibtech_214_footnoteI   wrote   to   the   British   Prime   Minister   during   my   stay   at Panchgani last year. The letter was written in the small hours of the night on July 17 at the same time that I wrote my Gujarati notelibtech_215_footnotelibtech_216_footnoteto Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah and duly posted to be sent through H. E. the Viceroy.
 Unfortunately the letter miscarried. Having waited for a long time, on September 10, 1944, during my visit to Bombay for the meeting with Qaid-e-Azam, I sent a letterlibtech_217_footnoteof enquiry out of curiosity, for the psychological moment had passed. To my surprise, the Private Secretary to the Viceroy wrote in return on September 13 that the letter in question was not received by him. As I attached importance to that letter, I sentlibtech_218_footnotehim a copy of the missing letter on September 17, 1944, repeating the request that it might be sent to the Prime Minister.
 My letter of July 17 to Mr. Churchill, in my estimation, was of a sacred character not meant for the public eye, but I could contemplate an occasion or time when it might call for publication without losing the sacred character.
 I, therefore, requested the Viceroy on December 3,  1944,libtech_219_footnoteto enquire from the Prime Minister whether I had his permission to publish it in case of need. He replied through his Secretary that thePrime Minister agreed to the publication of my letter subject to the fact that it was duly acknowledged.
The following is the text of the letter:
        DEAR 	PRIME MINISTER,  	‘DILKHUSHA’, PANCHGANI,  July 	17, 1944 
  You 	are reported to have a desire to crush the simple “Naked Fakir” 	as you are said to have described me. I have been long trying to be 	a “Fakir”        
 and that naked—a more difficult task. I, therefore, regard the expression as a compliment though unintended. I approach you then as such and ask you to trust and use me for the sake of your people and mine and through them those of the world."
258,"June 	18, 1945",INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS,"
     The 	Bombay Chronicle, 19-6-1948         Your 	sincere friend,  M. K. GANDHI          PANCHGANI,  June 	18, 1945 
  QUESTION: 	What did you mean when you said that the Desai Formulalibtech_220_footnotehad no such 	colouring as the Viceroy’s would seem to have, and how do you 	think that the Desai Formula would help to solve the communal 	tangle? ANSWER: 	Bhulabhai’s proposals have no colouring of caste.  	There is the 50 per cent basis as between two political bodies. If 	Bhulabhai’s proposals are the same as the Viceroy’s,  then  I  	am greatly mistaken. I did not read the proposals in that light. 	According to that Formula, if the Congress chose, it could appoint 	50 per cent of any community, non-Hindus, caste Hindus and non-caste 	Hindus. If the Congress is obliged to choose only caste Hindus or 	even casteless Hindus then it ceases to be Indian National Congress.  Asked 	if he was satisfied with the clarification offered by the Viceroylibtech_221_footnoteand the Secretary 	of Statelibtech_222_footnoteabout 	the question of independence, he said that it was a question for the 	Working Committee to answer. He had his own opinion but he did not 	wish to anticipate or influence the Working Committee by speaking to 	the public.  Q. 	What is your opinion about Lord Wavell’s personal efforts in 	solving the political deadlock? A. 	No one will know unless Lord Wavell chooses to write himself as 	to what part he has played in this connection.  Q. 	What do you think about the omission of the Hindu Mahasabha?  A. I have not thought 	over it, but as you prompt me I begin to think. I do not know 	whether it is the method of putting the Congress      
 in the place of the Hindu Mahasabha and treating it as a sectional or a Hindu body and if it is that, which I hope it is not, the Congress will be one to avoid the whole show. But there is another construction also to be put upon that omission, namely, that the British Government wants to avoid the conference being based on religious distinction and, therefore, for examining the proposal they have invited political representatives only. Against this favourable assumption has undoubtedly to be put the parity between Muslims and caste Hindus. But  I  have  publicly  announcedlibtech_223_footnotethat  I  believed  that   this   mistake, however grave, is one of ignorance. If my assumption is right, the mistake would be corrected. Thinking along the same lines I account for the omission of the Muslim Majlis or the Jamiat-ul-Ulema and similar bodies.
 I must not also omit to mention that the composition of the conference is a very great advance upon all similar bodies, for, in all previous conferences convened by the British Government, members have been nominated by the Government principally. This time the members of the conference are under no obligation to the Government for their nomination and they need not vote or speak merely to placate the Government. The Congress Premiers, for instance, are under obligation only to the Congress as those belonging to the Muslim League are answerable only to the League. So far as I can recall there has been no such conference before.
 Q. Why do you think the Maulana was omitted in the first instance?
 A. Because the Viceroy thought that I represented the Congress and the people had given him cause to think so. But I must say the moment I pointedlibtech_224_footnoteout the mistake he saw it at once and rectified it.

259,"June 18, 1945","SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, PANCHGANI","
    
 June 18, 1945
 Mahatma Gandhi addressing a prayer gathering on the eve of his departure from here said he had planned to stay at Panchgani till the end of the month but man proposes and God disposes.
 He thanked Principal Batha of the Parsi Girls’ High School for allowing the use of the school hall for holding prayer meetings and the girl students who sweetly chanted prayers from the scriptures in the evenings.
 To him the hall had become a prayer house where he found peace every evening and got over the mental fatigue of the day’s work. He had nothing to give them in return except his blessings.
 They should know, he continued, that he was going away for the same purpose for which he had come up to the hills. That purpose was the winning of India’s independence. If he wanted to live for 125 years, or if he died that very moment, or if he went to the hills for recouping his health, it was the same thing to him so long as his very breath was dedicated to that aim.
 His conception of swaraj was not mere political independence, He wanted to see dharmaraj—establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth—the reign of truth and non-violence in every walk of life. That alone was independence to the starved masses of this vast country.
 He hoped that those who attended his prayers did not come there for the sake of fun. They came to call the name of God so as to be able to do His work. To work for the independence of his hope was God’s work.
 To remain in slavery was beneath the dignity of man. A slave who was conscious of his state and yet did not strive to break his chains was lower than the beast. He who prayed from his heart could never accept slavery as his lot.
 Everyone said that this time at last the chance had come for bringing India’s independence nearer. He was a trusting man by temperament and he took statements at their face value. Nevertheless, they should repose their faith in prayer more than in a man’s work. Let them also know that we were all slaves of our passions. If we conquered them, we could easily overcome the slavery under foreigners or our own conquerors.

260,"June 19, 1945",INTERVIEW TO P. RAMCHANDRA RAO,"
    
 PANCHGANI,
 [Before June 19, 1945]libtech_225_footnote
 QUESTION:  Is  there  a  “Gandhian  Plan”, as  Prof.  Agrawallibtech_226_footnotewill  have   it, apart from the Gandhian programme? A plan necessarily involves a time schedule within which to attain definite objectives. You have yourself formulated no such plan?
ANSWER: For me there is neither a Gandhian plan nor Gandhian
 programme. But it would be too pedantic for me to object  to  a friend’s use of the word “Gandhian”. Your objection to the word “plan” is technically valid. But I am inclined to say there is no substance in the objection.
 The basis of the Gandhian programme is decentralization. But the core of planning is centralization. Can planning and Gandhism go together?
I must dissent from the view that the core of planning is
 centralization. Why should not decentralization lend itself to planning as well as centralization?
 Economic planning, says Prof. Agrawal, necessitates the least amount of State control. Yet the plan he unfolds by no means envisages a Government which will govern least because the emphasis throughout is on State action—“the responsibility of the State is very great”. Necessarily, communications, public health, education, trade and commerce, banking and currency, etc., must be State-controlled. And the plan clearly supports the nationalization of key and basic large-scale industries. How do these incompatible ideas fit in?
I  detect no incompatibility in the idea of decentralizing, to  the
 greatest extent possible, all industries and crafts, economically profitable in the villages of India, and centralizing or nationalizing the key and vital large industries required for India considered as a whole. Prof. Agrawal has taken illustrations from the present. When we have independence cum predominance of village industries in the place of city industries as at present, those who live to see that, as I hope youand I will, will face another and much healthier atmosphere and we shall see clearly what Prof. Agrawal and we see today only darkly. Today everything is controlled by a foreign State. Tomorrow the State will be controlled by the people (a very vital change in itself,) and if
 
 
 Prof. Agrawal’s plan (pardon the word) fructifies, then it is obvious that the State-control, though it appears to be big, will in reality be least. Just project in your mind’s eye 700,000 villages of India dominating the centre with its few towns required in the interests of the villages.
 The Gandhian programme is essentially a resuscitation of  village communities, ensuring the maximum utilization of human power. It is  an  evolutionary process. Is it not opposed to a definitive State planning, unless, of course, cottage industrialization is content to be complementary to nationalization of industries which the problems of a post-war India may make imperative ?
You have correctly described the programme standing in my
 name. You have lifted the term nationalization from its present setting and then put a perplexing question. I suggest your correcting yourself and examining the contents of the term in its new village setting. The ideal is too comprehensive for our modernized mind. Mine may be all a day-dream never destined to be realized. But that would be merely begging the question. We see that in a single generation we have the so-called impossible of yesterday become the possible of today.
 You have recently declaimedlibtech_227_footnoteagainst the big interests who speak loud against the Government and give the lie by their support of it for the crumbs that fall to them. It  is  answered  that Congress  itself  has   not   been   averse   to   befriend   these   big interests who exploit the Congress for their ends. Can you not stop such exploitation?
The Congress has never been, and I hope never will be, averse to
 the big interests so long as it hopes to convert them to national use instead of being itself converted by them in the process. My very declamation referred to by you shows that the big interests have to be on the right line, if they are to subserve the interests of the masses in the end. Today they are relatively serving the foreign ruler whilst they themselves merely get the crumbs from his table. It is unfortunate. But all will never think and be alike. In non-violence, there is mutual conversion instead of coercion.

   me? Your 	letter is good and also bad. And why again in English to   Your health will be 	good. It was not through carelessness that I 
  	used the expression to which you have drawn my attention. I had used 	it advisedly. It is another matter that I may change it out of 	consider- ation for somebody, but then it will not express what I 	feel.  	In the first place, the term ‘minorities’ includes, along with 	the Muslims, all the accepted minorities. This has been my own preo- 	ccupation from childhood. And if you are concerned solely about 	Muslims, I would like to say that sometimes when a Muslim  was  	wanted he was chosen not because he was the best Congressman  among 	Indians but because he was the best Congressman among Mus- lims and 	represented Muslims. I should be grieved if you did not know this, 	because you are a highly experienced man and a journalist. If you 	are interested in having the names of such minorities, I can send 	you. "

  	As I was about to leave Panchgani, I received a pathetic letterlibtech_229_footnotefrom which I take the following:  The 	immediate object of my writing this letter is to inform you about 	the very serious condition of Sri Sarat Chandra Bose, who is my 	maternal uncle. He is very unwell and his condition is causing grave 	anxiety to us all. If he is not at     
 least removed, if not released, immediately to a healthy place his days are numbered.
As Sri Sarat Babu has never been tried and found guilty
 evidently he has been detained all these years and that too away from Bengal, on suspicion. For the sake of simple justice Sri Sarat Bahu ought to be removed to a health resort in Bengal with facilities for him to see his relatives.

 DEAR MAULANA SAHEB,
 It was by mere chance that Pyarelal happened to see you. But what you told him, if his report of the talk is accurate, is startling. The Working Committee has not given you the right or the permission to form a cabinet. You yourself told me that you could not do it without the Working Committee. That is my view too. That was why I had said that you should form a small committee with the assistance of the Working Committee, which could be given that right and then act through that committee or the Working Committee itself. Since you did not react favourably to either of the proposals, I can only conclude that I do not understand or do not know the stand of the Working Committee in the matter.libtech_238_footnotelibtech_239_footnoteI understand from what Jamnalalji says that you are going to summon the Working Committee anyhow. I consider it improper. I would not wish you to be guilty of such a grave error at this juncture.
 I do not know what you have done and how you  could persuade the Viceroy. Even if you have committed yourself it is, in my view, your duty to inform him that a mistake has been committed. So much for the matter between you and the Working Committee.
 Another thing I would like to tell you is that in anything you do, you should take with you the Congress who are present and you should put everything in writing.
 The third is a personal matter. Ever since I first heard the Viceroy’s proclamationlibtech_240_footnotelibtech_241_footnote, that is, while I was still at Panchgani, I have been shouting that the Congress cannot accept the principle of parity between Muslims and non-Harijan Hindus, an organization of Hindus alone. Even if I am the only one among crores to do so, I shall refuse to be a party to it. I do not care if the negotiations break down on this, for I know and believe that the moment you try to form a national government at the centre in this way you will be laying a wrong

In this connection I would advise you to read a big 	booklibtech_256_footnotelibtech_257_footnoteSatish Babu has written on the cow. The first part of 	it is already published, the second is about to come out. His full 	address is . . .libtech_258_footnoteCalcutta. 	He is a first-class chemist. But he gave up everything long back and 	took up khadi work. He is very industrious. He wrote this book in 	jail. Those who want to work in the villages should read this book. 	It does not contain only Satis Babu’s views. He has taken every- 	thing from British and American reports. There is much scope 	forimprovement and addition in what you say in your book about 	cattle, cattle diseases and land. If the villagers have to depend on       
 Government veterinary doctors for treatment of their cattle, it is not going to work. This does not mean that the villagers are not to take their help but their knowledge should be adapted  to  village conditions. I have plenty of material on the subject but I do not want to give it here. Perhaps you know Dhiren Mazumdar. He is working in
 U.P. with Vichitra Narayan. He is Acharya Kripalani’s man and is very industrious. He knows his work well. If you have not already met him, do so. If possible go and see the Khadi Pratishthan of Satis Babu and then bring out a second edition. It will not be of much use as it is. Now that people have become interested in the subject they will buy your book and probably read it, too. However, they will not be able to derive much benefit from it, for, though they will know from the book what they have to do, it will not tell them how they are to do it. This I will expect in the second edition. I have seen from your book that you are interested in the subject and so I have offered the suggestions.
 One thing more. Take up at least one village, as I have taken up Sevagram. Then put into practice the things you have said in the book. In this way you will gain experience. This suggestion of mine has another consequence: You will have to do very little legal practice. You must be knowing that Brijkishore Babu, Rajendra Babu, Vallabhbhai and others had to totally give up their practice when they took up such work. I do not suggest that you go so far. You have a vast knowledge of law and have gained so much experience. So with slight modifications do as Motilal had done. While staying in a village take up two or three good cases. Take the cases of the poor free of charge. Devote the rest of your time to village reform. This is all I can say after going through your book.

  	How can I advice you? These are my views:  These  days educated men 	take advantage of the blind faith of women. Truthful women will give 	up their immoral and unfaithful husbands. Even educated women do not 	have self-respect and do not keep away from licentiousness. A woman 	indulging in lechery is certainly lecherous but the one who puts up 	with lechery is also lecherous.

 It is proposed to hold the first meeting of the Board as early as possible at Wardha. The date will be announced after consultation with the members by Acharya Shriman Narayan Agrawal. The names originally proposed at the Conference have undergone some change. All the persons whose names were proposed were not at the Confer- ence and substitutes had to be found for those of the absentees who did not find it possible to serve on the Board. I had hesitated to give my name for the Board, but as a result of correspondence with Dr. Tarachand and others, I have agreed to be on the Board as its Chairman. I may also add that the list is likely to be increased by a few names.

I have heard everything you have to say, so please give up the desire for a personal discussion with me. The real thing is work, and work alone, and the most important work is plying the charkha oneself and persuading others to ply it.

AT PRAYER MEETING,
SIMLAlibtech_264_footnote","
  
 [June 27, 1945]libtech_265_footnote
 Addressing the prayer meeting Mahatma Gandhi said that the object  of attending prayers was to commune with God and turn the searchlight inwards so that with the help of God they could overcome their weaknesses. He believed that one imbibed pure thoughts in the company of the pure. Even if there was one pure man in that gathering, the rest would be affected by that one man’s purity. The condition was that they came with that intention. Otherwise, their coming to the prayers was meaningless.
He went further and maintained that even if all had their
 weaknesses but came to the meeting with the intention of removing them, their co-operative effort made day to day would quicken the progress of reform. For even as co-operation was necessary, in the economic or the political field so was co-operation much more necessary on the moral plane. That was the meaning of the prayer meetings he had been holding since his return to India.
 Therefore, he appealed to them to sit absolutely quiet, with closed eyes, so as to shut themselves off from outward thoughts for a few minutes at least. This co-operative prayer needed no fuss, no advertisement. They must be free from hypocrisy.

‘MANOR VILLE’,
 June 29, 1945
  	Yesterday I came to know that you had gone to Rajaji’s house and 	there all of a sudden felt giddy. I was given to understand that in 	any case you were not feeling too fit and that partly I was 	responsible for it. That should not be so. I am very firm in my view 	and I should be so. There may be occasions when you do not agree 	with my views. So what? All of us, if we want to serve the country, 	should have our own opinions. Only then can the country forge ahead 	and a way be shown to the people. I firmly believe that you should 	not work at the cost of your health. Stop worrying and do not feel 	unhappy that you do not agree with my views.  	The more I think the more convinced I become that if the Working 	Committee tries to select as many Hindus as there areMuslims then 	the communal poison will spread throughout the country and we will 	never be able to win freedom. What is the harm if the Congress is 	reduced from a majority to a minority? Must we do a wrong thing to 	maintain our majority? Will not the Congress become a communal 	organization by selecting as many Hindus as there are Muslims?  	If the Congress takes the fewest of Hindus, and as many as possible 	from the other communities, the communal poison will be removed and 	it will succeed in bringing freedom nearer. I quite see that now the 	 first  step  towards  freedom  has  to  be  taken through the 	Government. The course should be straight so far as we are 	concerned.  	If people do not accept this, then let the reins of Government be 	passed to those whom the people approve. Everything will be all 	right even if there are only a few straightforward persons. This  is 	 my opinion and I can never give it up.    
 You have taken for granted that the Working Committee at Bombay has accepted the principle of parity. I have rejected it.
Please get well.

318,"June 	29, 1945",INTERVIEW TO PRESTON GROVER,"
        SIMLA, 
  June 	29, 1945  In 	reply to 	my questions, Gandhiji 	said be 	was feeling 	well and that 	the 7,000-foot 	altitude of Simla had not affected him so far, although he was 	watchful that  he did not 	overstrain his heart.  Answering 	an initial request that he should give a report on the negotiations 	as they stood at the moment, Mahatma Gandhi said: I 	wish I could, but I am here only as an adviser. I have, for many  	years, been advising the Congress. But now, I have constituted 	myself as an adviser both to the Congress and to the Viceroy,  too,  	and  through him of the British people. You see, that makes my 	position exceptionally delicate. The only information I have is what 	my colleagues bring when they come to me. Frankly speaking, I do not 	know in what position the conference exactly is today. It has never 	been my habit to cry out of curiosity.  It 	was suggested that the Congress representatives should keep him 	advised almost hourly, to which he replied: They 	do, and they do not. Unless the Viceroy wants my advice, I  	would know nothing as to what is happening at that end. But, if 	things go on smoothly, he does not need my advice. On our side too, 	while they do come to me, it need not be from day to day or hour to 	hour. While, therefore, I cannot tell you what exactly the situation 	in the conference is, I can only share with you my hope and prayer 	that things will come right both for India and Great Britain. I say 	for both, because I do not know that, even if a settlement is pulled 	through, it will be on right lines.  	But I give you a tip. I was not joking when I made a statementlibtech_270_footnotesome time back in answer to Sir Feroz Khan Noon at San 	Francisco,    
 that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru is my heir. He has got ability, knowledge and close touch with the public here and can interpret India’s mind. I have already, as I wrotelibtech_271_footnotelibtech_272_footnoteto Lord Linlithgow, taken him as my guide in international affairs. He can interpret India’s mind to the outside  world as no one else can.
 This much I can say, that Congress can never become sectional organization. Not that there are not communal-minded people in it, but the Congress can never work communally. Therefore, normally speaking, the parity principle should be distasteful to everybody.
 Turning to the composition of the current conference, Gandhiji declared it was “political in its complexion” and not communal. This was in direct contradiction to the Muslim League argument that the whole conference was chosen on communal basis.
If they wanted various groups to be represented communally,
 they should have invited the Hindu Mahasabha and not the Congress, which has always been, and is now, a purely political body trying to think and act in terms of the whole nation. It cannot belie its entire history at this critical moment.
 Asked if an acceptance of invitation to work for an interim government was in the belief that it was a step towards independence, Gandhiji replied:
The acceptance of the invitation was a recognition of the
 fact that it was a step towards independence. But this was subjectto explanation and clarification of what was in the Viceroy’s mind. It was like sitting on the top of a volcano which might erupt. I took that risk.
 Toward the end of the interview, it was suggested that Mr. Jinnah, President of the Muslim League, was reported to be somewhat resentful  that Gandhiji  had withdrawn from the conference.
If Mr. Jinnah wants me there, he can take me there. We shall
 both go arm in arm. He can help me up the hill and save strain on my heart. Such a gesture on Mr. Jinnah’s part would mean that he wants a settlement even in the teeth of the differences and obstacles that face the conference. You can tell him that I am quite willing to be taken to the conference by him.
 I suggested that not only Mr. Jinnah, but Lord Wavell, most of India and all observers at the conference looked upon Gandhiji as head of the Congress regardless of the technicality that he was not a member, and that no settlement would be reached
 
 
 without his consent. Gandhiji replied:
 That is both right and wrong. That impression has been created because generally my advice is accepted. But technically and substantially it is wrong. The conference is legally representative and, therefore, I can have no place in it.
 To my insistence that his was the controlling voice in the Congress, Gandhiji replied:
Not even that. They can shunt me out at any time, brush aside
 my advice. If I tried to override them, I might succeed for once. But the moment I try to cling to power, I fall, never to rise again. That is, not in my temperament.

 SIMLA,
 June 30, 1945
 GANDHIJI:
 I have registered your claim but have nothing to say. I generally don’t speak during day but for your sake I am speaking to you as a special case. You have to prompt me.libtech_284_footnote
 CORRESPONDENT: What will be the composition of the interim government if you have your way?
G.   (Laughing)   The   interim   government   will  consist   of top
 men, irrespective of caste, creed or colour. If I became the Viceroy of India, I would startle the world with my list and yet make it acceptable.
 I asked Mahatmaji to explain what he meant by top men, and he amplified his remark by saying that he meant men and women who are fittest to do the work the country needs.  The Mahatma said:
Of course, nobody will take the trouble of appointing me the
 Viceroy of India nor of electing me as President of the Congress—for I am not even a four-anna member of the Congress to be eligible for election—with full authority to appoint the new government.
 Mahatma Gandhi said that he would not hesitate to leave out anyone at present in the Congress, if he felt that better men were available outside who would work in their respective spheres so as to bring full independence at the earliest time possible.   I next asked:
 In the course of your correspondence with the Viceroy on his proposals, you objected to the term “caste Hindus” in the matter of parity of representation for Hindus and Muslims, adding that if this parity between caste Hindus and Muslims was
 
 the snow-capped Himalayan. .  . ranges.	was actually enjoying the magnificent
 scenery in front of him.”
 unalterable, then the Congress would have no place in the new Government.libtech_285_footnoteAccording to the reports, the Congress delegates to the Conference have accepted parity between Hindus other than Scheduled Classes and Muslims. Have you any comment to make on this?
If Congressmen have accepted parity, it cannot be in the sense
 you imagine. I interpret the Viceregal pronouncementlibtech_286_footnoteto mean that neither community can ask for more representation than the other in the national cabinet. Thus Hindus other than the Scheduled Classes can, if they wish, be less but not more than the Muslims.libtech_287_footnote
 Do you approve of the procedure suggested by Lord Wavell yesterday at the leaders’ conference for the selection of the new Executive Council, namely, that all parties should submit separate panels of names to the Viceroy first and that thereafter he would consult Party leaders before making his final selection and place the personnel finally selected by him before the conference for approval?
The procedure suggested by Lord Wavell is, in my opinion,
 good inasmuch as the Viceroy does not seek to impose his will on the conference. The Viceroy has said in his opening remarks to the delegates that the various elements represented in the conference should regard him, the Viceroy, as their leader. It is a good and dignified expression that Lord Wavell has used. He thus acts at the conference as its leader and not as the agent of Whitehall.

I hope everything goes on well there. If Dr. Ice insists on buffalo’s milk, let him procure it for himself and drink it. I don’t think it is in any way our duty to supply him with it. He should make do with what we supply in the ordinary course. Is Kanchan able to help you in any way or does she still continue to be ill? I expect a letter from her with details of her work.

       SIMLA,  July 	2, 1945  	In or about the year 1902, I, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, then of 	Johannesburg, Attorney, bought a piece of property about 100 acres 	in two lots, popularly known as the Phoenix Settlement, for 	benevolent purposes. Not wishing to have anything in my name as sole 	owner, I converted it into a trust and had it duly registered at 	Pietermaritzburg, Natal.libtech_291_footnote  	All the trustees, except Lewis Walter Ritch of Johannesburg, 	Attorney, and I as settlers’ trustee, have died.  	The settlers under the Trust have all retired from the Phoenix 	Settlement. My son, Manilal Gandhi, together with his wife, Sushila- 	behn Gandhi, and their children have lived on the Settlement and 	managed the property and the weekly newspaper Indian Opinion, 	founded by me.  	Now it is my intention to broaden the Trust and appoint new 	trustees. Therefore the conditions of the present Trust shall be:   As 		long as 		possible to conduct the 		newspaper, Indian 		Opinion, in 		English and 		Gujarati and 		other Indian and 		even African     
 languages according to felt necessity and convenience including reso- urces but never at a loss. Any profits made from the newspaper after the deduction of running expenses shall be returned to the Settlement.
  The 	Press Department 	may undertake 	job work 	and the 	sale of 	literature approved by 	the Trust in 	the interest 	of and 	healthy instructions of 	the public.  The 	Trust may 	found a 	public library 	and school, 	subject to 	rules made by 	the trustees 	and built 	from donations given 	by the 	public. These shall be 	named after my 	deceased wife, Kasturba.  The 	trustees may 	also found 	nature cure 	establishments and 	undertake all 	activities that may 	educate Indians morally, 	socially, economically 	and hygienically. All 	decisions of 	the trustees shall be 	by majority. 
 For the purposes aforesaid I appoint the following  trustees  during life or at my discretion:
 The 	said Lewis Walter Ritch, Manilal 	Mohandas Gandhi, Parsi 	Jalbhai Rustomji, Surendrarai 	Medh, [and a] [A] Muslim. 
 The said Manilal Gandhi shall be the Managing Trustee and, while he is manager of the Trust and editor of Indian Opinion, shall draw not more than one hundred pounds per month with free lodging on the Settlement for himself, his wife and children. The said Manilal Gandhi shall maintain proper books of account for the management of the Trust property and the newspaper, Indian Opinion. Separate accounts shall be maintained in respect of Indian Opinion and the management of the Trust property. The said accounts shall be audited every six months.
 In the event of any of the trustees being dead, resigning or  being displaced by me, the remaining trustees may appoint another instead, my consent being considered necessary during my life.

 ‘‘MANOR VILLE’, SIMLA WEST,
 July 2, 1945
 CHI. KISHORELAL,
 I have sat down to write love letters immediately after the prayer today. The first I wrote to Bishop Westcott, the second to the ailing Narendra Dev and this third I am writing to you. Doesn’t the ˜æè look like Öè ? Can a pot have its neck reshaped after it is baked? But I wonder whether this saying can be applied to a living pot. It must of course have been first used by a wiseacre for an old man. So much for joking, though not quite without meaning.
 Though I am engaged here in an important work, all the same the mind is filled with supreme peace. My window opens on the Himalayas. As soon as it was known that I would have to stay here for fifteen days, the mind turned to this spectacle. Since the house was built for men accustomed to sitting in chairs, one can see nothing if one squats on the floor. I, therefore, became shameless and seated myself on a bench. Now the eyes are stuck on the scene, so is the mind. Even while lying on the bench I can see something of the spectacle. On a clear day, the hills are covered with snow. For a spectacle better than this, one must go to Shivji’s Kailas!
 My Kailas, however, is Sevagram. The life-giving waters of my Ganga flow from there. Narahari and you, therefore, should devote
 your spare time to removing the deficiencies of the place. I have said as much as I could in my letter to Narahari. I hope he has filled in the rest.
 Are Gomati and you as you were before? Do you have faith in the Ishopanishad, and aspire to live up to 125 for the sake of service? And if you do, are you ready to fulfil the conditions for that?
 As for the developments here, newspapers have given fairly detailed reports.

  	Is your health improving? Or was the improvement only momentary? Now 	Khurshed is with you, Prabha is with you. If human love can keep you 	alive you are bound to live. God knows best. We are getting on. The 	‘Jewel of India’libtech_294_footnotearrived yesterday. Let us  see what happens.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         July 	2, 1945  Mahatma Gandhi drew the attention of the people to the new rule of the A. I. S.  A. 	according to which payment for khadi had to be made partly in yarn. 	This rule had come into force from the first of July in Simla. 	People had said to him that Simla Khadi Bhandar sold khadi to all 	sorts of people who came up for short or long visits. Most of them 	could not spin and the sales of the Bhandar would go down if part 	payment of the price of khadi in yarn was insisted upon. He did not 	mind such a result, untoward though it would be.  There 	was a 	time, Gandhiji 	said, when they aimed at 	promoting the 	sale of 	khadi to help 	the poor to supplement 	their income. But 	deep thought, especially 	during his 	recent incarceration, 	had convinced 	him that 	if khadi 	was to 	serve as 	a means 	of bringing 	swaraj, its scope and 	meaning had 	to be extended. 	He could 	not keep 	a mighty 	organization like the A. 	I. S. A. merely for 	producing and 	selling khadi 	for the sake 	of providing 	economic relief. Any 	other occupation could be 	utilized for 	that purpose. If 	khadi was 	to bring 	swaraj through non-violence, millions had 	to spin 	with the full 	consciousness of 	its implication 	in terms 	of ahimsa 	and independence. 	The A. 	I. S. A. had started 	by asking 	for yarn 	worth only two pice 	for every 	rupee worth of 	khadi sold. If 	he could carry 	conviction, he 	would insist upon 	the full payment 	being made 	in yarn. If 	they loved 	freedom, they should 	not find it burdensome to do that much—those who did not wish to be free had no business to    
 come to the prayers. A man of prayer could never accept slavery as his lot.
 If all had taken to spinning in the way he wanted it, Gandhiji said, they would have had swaraj without any further effort. He would not have had to come up to Simla. But society was made of all kinds of people. Therefore he had to come in common with others for the conference to see whether it was possible through the conference [to find a] way to further the progress towards independence.
 As for the yarn to be given in exchange for khadi it should be either spun by the individual concerned or by members of his family. The farthest the A. I. S. A. could go was to let them take yarn spun by their servants whom they should treat as members of the family. Yarn bought from the black market could not serve the purpose in view. Also, if Bhandars began to sell yarn to prospective purchasers of khadi, that would defeat the very purpose for which the new rule was being enforced.

342,"July 2, 1945",LETTER TO LORD SAMUEL,"
    
 [After July 2, 1945]libtech_295_footnote
 DEAR LORD SAMUELlibtech_296_footnote,
 I have your letter of 2nd July. I am sorry that you are still unconvinced. The ground of your objections seems to be that whilst the Congress may sincerely wish to embrace all parties and is trying to do so, it has not yet been able to achieve it and that its ultimate achievement is problematical, while the taking of the delivery is to be immediate and certain. This objection again overlooks the very  relevant fact to which I have twice drawn your attention, namely, that the Congress through its president has invited the Government to transfer full power to the League and ask it to form a truly national government, in which it would have the loyal co-operation of the Congress. This offer was reiterated at Simla. But I am sorry to have to say it was again turned down.
 I still adhere to my statement that “there cannot be Swaraj without an understanding with the Muslims.” My contention is and has been that the presence of the third party is the greatest stumbling- block in the way of this understanding. So long as one community in the country enjoys the power of vetoing all political progress there can be no reasonable settlement. In India this anomalous power is
 
 assured to the League by the British Government which supererogates to itself the right of arbitrating and holding the balance of power between the various communities. In the absence of  an  agreed solution, a just solution through impartial arbitration is held to be the only feasible alternative in civilized society, but in India the absence of an agreed solution is strangely held to be a justification  for retention of power by an alien Government over a nation of 400 millions ! ‘Quit India’ can be the only reply to such a claim. It seemsstrange that you should see in this cry a manifestation of totalitarian spirit instead of the anguished despair of an  enslaved people to be free from totalitarian foreign rule which has in the past demonstrably sabotaged all their efforts to achieve unity in order to be free and spurned their united and unanimous demands for political advance.

  	The Congress list for the proposed Executive was sent to you 	yesterday by the President.   In 		spite of 		my earnest protest, the 		parity was 		preserved. I 		was sorry. 		This does not 		mean any 		change on 		my part. I 		am more 		than ever convinced 		that the non-Schedule 		Hindu members should 		have been less than the Muslims.  You 		will observe in 		the list the 		nomination of 		the President of 		the Hindu 		Mahasabha. I 		think this was 		necessary and 		graceful. If 		you accept 		the Congress 		list, may I 		suggest your 		inviting Dr. 		Shyam- aprasad 		Mukerji before the 		meeting of 		the 14th 		instant ?  Dr. 		 Rajendra  Prasad 		 tells  me  that  the   hanging 		 of 		  Shri Mahendra 		Chowdhury is about 		to take 		place on or any 		day after 12th instant. He 		is an inmate of 		Bhagalpur Central Jail, Bihar.   	I take it that you will order commutation of sentence or stay till 	the proposed Executive is able to deal with it.libtech_314_footnote

 BHAI BHULABHAI,
 You had said you would be seeing Dr. Khan Saheb and you would then tell me how wrong he was in what he had said about your drinking. According to the Doctor you had not seen him till the day before yesterday. He himself tried to meet you but he could not find you.
 A lady who heard about this said: “I am a witness to the fact that Bhulabhai drinks and associates with undesirable women. His drinking and going around in the company of undersirable women is known all over Simla.”
 Even if this is true, you can still stand on the Congress ticket. I was further told that at the meeting held at Maulana Saheb’s residence you had crossed the limit of decency while presenting your case.
 Even with regard to money, what you told me does not appear to be correct. Even in writing this, my intention is to do good to you and the Congress. If you cannot cleanse yourself, you must consider all your talents as of no account.
 Blessing from
 BAPU

MEETING, SIMLAlibtech_338_footnote","
    
 July 12, 1945
 Mahatma Gandhi referred to the serious inconvenience experienced by his host due to unruly crowds. Some of them had invaded the house opposite to ‘Manor Ville’, which belonged to Rajkumari Amrit Kaur’s brother and had smashed flower-pots and damaged the railing of the verandah. When checked by the Rani Saheba they had been rude to her. All this hurt him deeply. He would have liked to run away. But after all, wherever he went the crowds would go with him. He could not run away from them. He was their servant and he lived to serve them.
 Some came to the prayers, Gandhiji said, simply to have his darshan. He had told them often enough that he was not a mahatma. He was just one of them, an ordinary human being. He must, however, confess that he called the name of God with every breath of his life and in everything that he did he proceeded with God as hiswitness. But that should not make him a mahatma. Every human being should act as he claimed he did. That was what distinguished man from beast. Those who came to the prayers should at least have decent manners. Even the soldiers in arms observed discipline and behaved in an orderly fashion. These who came to pray should have better manners, not worse. The object of coming to prayers was to praise God and for doing that, purity of thought was a necessary pre-requisite. If they could not control their minds, they should pray to God that he should enable them to have pure thoughts at least during prayers. Gradually and with practice they would be able to control them at all times.

 Prayer is even more essential for the well-being of the soul than is food for the maintenance of the body. It becomes necessary to give up food on occasions in order to benefit the body. But prayer may never be abandoned. If we provide food for the body  which is perishable, then, surely, it is our primary duty to provide food for the soul which is imperishable and such sustenance is found in prayer. The real meaning of prayer is devoted worship.

           DEAR 	FRIEND,       	‘MANOR 	VILLE’, 	 SIMLA WEST,  July 	15, 1945 
  	I thank you for your note of the 14th instant. It gladdens me to 	think that you have appreciated my effort to advance the common 	cause. As you perhaps know, I have arranged to leave here tomorrow. 	A special from Kalka will carry me to Wardha by the kind courtesy of 	the authorities concerned. . .  	It grieves me to think that the conference which  began  so happily 	and so hopefully should have ended in apparent failure—due 	exactly, as it would seem, to the same cause as before. This time 	you have taken the blame on your own shoulders.libtech_344_footnotelibtech_345_footnoteBut 	the world will think otherwise. India certainly does.  	I must not hide from you the suspicion that the deeper cause is 	perhaps the reluctance of the official world to part with power, 	which the passing of the virtual control into the hands of their 	erstwhile prisoners would have meant.  	Be that as it may, what a pity that the moral height which the 	British, if not even the Allied Powers, would have occupied by the 	suc- cess of the conference cannot be theirs, at any rate, for the 	time being.  	I must  not  close  this  without  a  reminder  about  the  Bihar 	case. Your passing remark that it was  one  of  ordinary  dacoity, 	calling for the heavy hand of law, disturbed me. This was not such    
 dacoity. The young man who is under sentence of death is no professional dacoit. He is a misled Congressman under twenty-five years (I think.) with a young wife of twenty years. I do hope that all such death sentences will be commuted to life sentences. It seems tobe the least demand of humanity, if not also of high politics.libtech_346_footnote

 A man does not become a satyagrahi by styling himself as such.
The observance of pure truth alone makes him a satyagrahi.
 April 26, 1945
 Is  only  that  unclean  which  appears  to  the  eye  as   unclean? If there  is  even  a  little  dirt  on  what  is  white,  we  feel  annoyed; but the black may have any amount of dirt on it and we care not at all!
 April 27, 1945
 We consider the black impure and the white pure. But black, in its natural setting, is as much a virtue; as white, out of place, is a vice.
 April 28, 1945
 How strange that one who claims not to fear death fears it the most, and seeks every means to avoid it!
 April 29, 1945 A son’s obeisance to his parents is undoubtedly a form of prayer. What homage, then, must we pay to Him who is the Eternal
Father of us all? Prayer may not be interpreted here in a narrow sense.
 April 30, 1945 “A Thought for Today,’, published in today’s The Times of India, appealed to me. Its purport is: “Believe in Truth, think Truth

 fortnight, and then off and on.	” Before leaving Sevagram for nature cure treatment
 at Bhimavaram, Hingorani had requested Gandhiji to write something for him daily, which Gandhiji began to do from November 20, 1944, vide In June 1946, when Hingorani sought Gandhiji’s permission to publish the ‘thoughts, in a book form, Gandhiji remarked: “What is there about them that you are so keen on publishing them? If, however, you wish to publish them, do so after my death. Such writings are generally never published during the lifetime of their authors. Who knows, I may not be able to live up to what I have written ! But if I live up to it till the last breath of my life, then alone will it be worthwhile to publish these thoughts.” Gandhiji, however, discontinued the practice by the end of 1946, as he put it, “for the sake of my Noakhali mission, I renounced practically everything       gave up the Ashram, all my
 companions and even writing for  the Harijan.	”

 Where there is hypocrisy, even if there is something good along with it, do not go there even for the sake of picking up that good only. If you do, it could be co-operation with evil which must not be offered:
 May 2, 1945
 Just as we throw away milk if there is poison in it, so must we reject any good which has got the poison of hypocrisy mixed with it.

 Says Confucius: “In a well-ordered State, progress is not measured in terms of wealth. The purity of the People and  their leaders alone constitutes the true wealth of the nation.”
 May 4, 1945
 Minds are of two kinds: one kind elevates, the other debases. Let us constantly reflect over this and learn to distinguish one from the other.

 Just as only others can see a man’s back while he  himself  cannot, we too cannot see our own errors.

 Is not death, in every case, a release from too much suffering? If so, why lament when it comes?
 May 7, 1945
Life is likened to a rose; because life, too, is full of thorns.

 By whatever name God be called, if there be godly attributes, we must surely bow to Him.
 May 13, 1945
 Then, what should God be like? Passionless and Formless, He should be a repository of all attributes and yet be wholly without attributes. Why should God then be of masculine gender? This is purely a question of grammar. The God of our conception, being formless, is neither male nor female.

 “Sweet are the fruits of equanimity”—the truth of this is experienced every moment.
 May 25, 1945
 There is a vast difference between obstinacy and steadfastness. To seek to foist one’s view on others is obstinacy; whereas steadfastness is that whereby we voluntarily impose something on ourselves and which results in bringing others round to the acceptance of our view of their own free will.
 May 26, 1945
 What should a man do when there is much work and little time to do it in? He should have patience, do what he believes is most useful and leave the rest to God. If God grants life, the arrear can be taken up some other day.

 I took off my spectacles to wash my face. I had intended to pick them up later, but forgot to do so. Why? Because something else engrossed my attention and so I became negligent. This is called disorganization which is a dangerous thing.
 May 28, 1945
 A man is ashamed when he does something wrong. But when he does something good, he wishes to let it be known. Why?
 May 29, 1945
 Envy devours him who harbours it. He who is the object of envy remains unaffected, perhaps even unaware of it.
 May 30, 1945
 The opposite of envy is generosity. Generosity does not allow us to be envious of anyone. On the contrary, if we find virtue in anyone, we appreciate it and even profit by it.
 May 31, 1945
Every moment I observe how man deceives himself.
 June 1, 1945
He who wants to please all, will please none.
 June 2, 1945
 It is God that we have to please. If we praise, we should praise Him only. Then shall we become free of all worry and botheration.
 June 3, 1945
 How shall we please God, how praise Him? By serving His creature—man.
 June 4, 1945
 When, as a matter of habit, a man knows not what he speaks, it is high time that he got rid of that habit either by muffling his mouth or even by sealing his lips.
 Jane 5, 1945 Desire is of various kinds—good, bad and feasible. The mind should harbour only that which is good and possible of realiza-
tion.
 June 6, 1945 Different people interpret the Shastras (religious scriptures) differently. The right course is to follow in practice that interpretation
 which appeals to us as basically sound even if it can be proved to be grammatically unsound, provided, however, that our interpretation is not opposed to morality and that it makes for self-restraint.
 June 7, 1945 An untruthful person leaves many a loophole for himself. And  when he escapes through one or the other, he thinks he is very clever!
 In fact, by doing so, he only digs pitfalls for himself.
 June 8, 1945
 A man of Truth, on the other hand, plugs all loopholes; or rath- er for him, it may be said, there is neither a wall nor any holes. He can walk even blindfold on the right path and never does he fall into a pit.
 June 9, 1945
 Non-attachment is difficult of attainment, as some say. So it is. But are not the things we need always difficult to obtain? It is only when we put in a sustained and determined effort that what is difficult becomes easy.

 Drops make the ocean, the reason being that there is complete cohesion and co-operation among the drops. The same law applies to human beings.

 To conceal ignorance is to increase it. An honest confession of it, however, gives ground for the hope that it will diminish.
 June 12, 1945
 What is learnt by rote is of as little value as  the  parrot’s recitation of Ramanama.
 
 June 13, 1945
 If the foregoing is correct and borne out by experience, it follows that knowledge that sinks deep, and becomes part of one’s being, is capable of transforming man, provided, however, that such knowledge is self-knowledge.
 June 14, 1945
 If a man does anything, and regrets it afterwards, it shows that he has not done it with due deliberation but under compulsion.
 June 15, 1945
 Non-attachment is put to real test only when there is full scope for our attachment to something.
 June 16, 1945
 It is man’s habit to forget his own faults and see those of others.
This naturally brings him disappointment in the end.
 June 17, 1945
 To have faith in God should be the easiest thing in the world, yet it appears to be the most difficult.
 June 18, 1945
 The root cause of most of our misunderstandings lies in distrust, and the root cause of this distrust lies most in fear.
 June 19, 1945
 The common saying goes that there can be no love without fear. But that is wrong. The fact is that where there is fear, there can be no true love.
 June 20, 1945
 Experience is daily growing upon  me that everything is attainable through silence.
 June 21, 1945
 If we stopped talking about useless things and talked of things that matter in as few words as possible, much of our time as well as that of others could be saved.
 June 22, 1945
 It follows from the foregoing that we would be thereby adding that much time to our span of life.
 June 23, 1945
 The same thing when looked at from one angle makes us lose our temper, and when viewed from another makes us laugh. Will it not be better if we neither become angry nor laugh?
 June 24, 1945
 Daily we have testimony of the influence exercised by one who speaks the truth and lives up to it. Even so, we never  think  of following his example in word and deed.
 June 25, 1945
 Sacrifice which causes pain is no sacrifice at all. True sacrifice is joy-giving and uplifting.
 June 26, 1945
 True help can come only from God. But God helps  only  through some agency. Let no one, therefore, knowingly seek the help of a broken reed.
 June 27, 1945
 Guru Teg Bahadur says: “The life which causes the least  possible injury is simple life. That which causes no pain at all is pure life.” Therefore, he alone practises true religion who does nothing evil.
 June 28, 1945
 If someone says, “Go straight along this road”, and if a man follows the given direction, he is sure to reach his destination. Such a road is truth. Going along that road, a man reaches his goal in the shortest possible time.
 June 29, 1945
 Every minute of my life I am conscious of the presence of God.
Why, then, need I fear anyone?
 June 30, 1945
 A man came to me today and said: “I lose all interest in living if  I do not render true service”.
 July 1, 1945
 Do not lose your temper if someone calls you a liar or opposes you. If you want to say something, say it calmly. Or, perhaps, silence would be best. If you are really truthful, you do not become a liar simply because someone calls you so.
   Untruth corrodes the 	soul, truth nourishes it.  July 	2, 1945   July 	3, 1945 
  	There is greater pleasure in not eating than in eating. Who has not 	experienced the truth of it?  July 	4, 1945 Do 	not listen to rumour; but, if you do, do not believe it. 
 July 5, 1945
 We must always listen to criticism of our faults and failings, never to our praises.
 July 6, 1945
 When ‘I’ and when ‘God’? In determining this lies the test of wisdom.
 July 7, 1945 God is one. He is ever Changeless and Formless. We are his mirrors. If we are straight and pure, God is also reflected in us as such.
 But if we are crooked and vile, His image suffers the same distortion. It behoves us, therefore, always to remain clean and pure in every respect.
   To find fault is one 	thing; to prove it is another.  July 	8, 1945   July 	9, 1945 
  	He alone knows the charm of solitude who has  deliberately taken to 	it.  July 	10, 1945 He 	who is the dust of everybody’s feet is near to God.

 [GANDHIJI:] Study and work for the country’s freedom. This is my message to the students of India.
 Gandhiji said that he realized the despondency of the student community on the failure of the Simla Conferencelibtech_354_footnoteand the danger of ill-feeling that might creep in between Hindu and Muslim students. Hopes must not be lost.
 Gandhiji stressed the need of unity among students and said it was deplorable that a number of parties existed and things had reached such a stage that the police were sometimes required to intervene. He wished that students of every creed, colour and caste worked as a united body for the common cause. He advised the people [to refrain] from indulging in mutual recriminations.
 Asked if the Simla Conference failed on the issue of one seat given to a non-Leaguer, Mahatma Gandhi refuted the contention. He said that he would publicize his views regarding this problem at the earliest opportunity.

 [July 17, 1945]libtech_355_footnote
 M. N. TANDON: Failure at Simla has disappointed the people who looked to a change in the regime.
GANDHIJI: They should not be disappointed. The Congress took
a correct attitude and has vindicated its national character.
 M. N. T. Mutual apportionment of blame has begun between the Congress and the League leaders and the papers. Would this not embitter relations and dash hopes of any future settlement, thus drifting to a position of civil war and riots?
G. Mutual recriminations should not be indulged in though truth
 will have to be spoken. There is a danger of the situation drifting into a civil war. The clash at Delhi station before Maulana Azad’s compart-ment is a pointer. But the police should not be allowed to maintain order amongst us. But if riots take place what can we do? Riots have always been taking place. Even in the reign of . . .libtech_356_footnotelibtech_357_footnoteriots and disturb-ances took place. This country is inhabited by a very large population of various conflicting ideas.
 M. N. T. Civil disturbances of the older days were no comparison to those of today with their political and economic implications. Patriots of the Congress and the League would fight instead of uniting for people’s service, with the result that the people would lose faith in the honesty and patriotism of both. Their miseries would increase tenfold and the national movement would go to pieces.
G. Yes. We should make efforts not to let such a situation
develop.
 M. N. T. Do you hope that the Congress and the League will be able to settle in the near future?
G. We should all hope so.
 M. N. T. The belief of the common man is that the Conference broke over the question of a single seat due to dissensions among the leaders.
G. It is wrong to say that the Conference broke over the question
 
 
 
 of one seat. The Congress fought for a principle.
 M. N. T. Even if the Congress had to nominate only Hindu Congressmen, they could very well have represented the Nationalist Muslims and safeguarded their interests. There is no difference between Congressman and Congressman.
G. But we were seeking able men of all parties and communities.
We did not bother which party got what number of seats.
 M. N. T. You had accepted the Bhulabhai Formulalibtech_358_footnoteof Congress-League parity and gave a public statementlibtech_359_footnoteto that effect. But the Congress Working Committee agreed to Hindu-Muslim parity, proposed by Wavell,libtech_360_footnotethus raising the rock of breakdown, since Congress and League could not agree to the nomination of one by the other. Is it a fact that the Working Committee disagreed with you and rejected the Congress-League parity formula?
G. Now you are dragging me into deep water. Yes. The truth is
something like this. I shall write about it in the near future.
 M. N. T. You perhaps know that the Communists’ main slogan all through the Conference has been “transform Hindu-Muslim parity into Congress-League parity” and they are making efforts in the direction.
G. They should continue their efforts.
 M. N. T. On what grounds did your correspondence with P. C. Joshilibtech_361_footnotebreak?
G. Who says it has broken down?
 M. N. T. Has the Working Committee taken any decision regarding the Communists?
G. No. It has not taken any decision.
 M. N. T. You know the ban of the U. P. Government continues on the three Communist weeklieslibtech_362_footnotein U. P.
G. Have they not yet lifted the ban? It is very wrong for the
Government to do so.
 M. N. T. Sjt. J. C. Guptalibtech_363_footnoteand others met you at Simla in connection with the release of pre-reform political prisoners who have already served 14 to 20 years of
 
 
 imprisonment. You have the power to get them released.
 G. Efforts should certainly be made to secure their release.libtech_364_footnoteIt is wrong to say that I alone have the power to get them out.

 SEVAGRAM,
 July 18, 1945
 The public will not like to know, as I have not liked, the fact that  I had to travel from Kalka to Wardha like a thief. I could do so only by the courtesy of the authorities. Why should I have to escape the embarrassing affection of the public? When I travelled by the Frontier Mail from Bombay to Kalkalibtech_365_footnotelibtech_366_footnote, at every stopping station it was a wild demonstration. Accidents, even fatal, were escaped by miracle. Those who were with me in the compartment had a rough time and two wakeful nights.
 Singly I might not have been able to cope with the din, noise and hustle of the crowd. Of course this was not the first time that I had to face such wild demonstrations, nor am I unaware that other leaders have to go through such ordeals, but the fact is that each year makes me less fit for them. My ears cannot stand the noise. I can do no work among demonstrators and cannot make Harijan collections in such circumstances. What is most painful is the fact that this wildness is no prelude to swaraj, it is no sign of non-violence.
 Crowds there should be to greet the leaders, but they should be peaceful, dignified and completely disciplined. I have seen ordinary soldiers in thousands observing perfect silence whether on the march or at rest. Our crowds, if they are non-violent  soldiers  of  swaraj, should be more disciplined than ordinary soldiers. Will leaders of volunteers learn a lesson from my train journey from Kalka to Wardha and ensure perfectly peaceful demonstrations at stations and elsewhere in all circumstances and not only or especially for me?

           DEAR 	FRIEND,           SEVAGRAM,  July 	23, 1945 
  	I have your letterlibtech_414_footnoteof 	18th instant about Mahendra Chowdhury for which I thank you. Apart 	from the merits about which I should have much to say if      
 there was room for argument, I question the prudence of one person, however eminent, deciding to take the life of a person even proved guilty, without having an impartial tribunal to advise him. Moreover, this case had, rightly or wrongly, assumed a political character. How I wish you had been wisely guided!

       BHAI 	SHYAMLAL libtech_429_footnote,         July 	23, 1945 
  	There are two ways of serving the Harijans. First, by raising them 	through education, etc., and secondly by rooting out untouch- 	ability from among the caste Hindus. The first course always bears 	fruit and it is desirable to pursue it however little one can. 	Simple ‘Eradication of Untouchability’ does not serve our 	purpose. There- fore, ‘Harijan Sevak Sangh’ is a more 	appropriate expression. It is true that so far very little work has 	been done among the savarnas. The reasons are obvious. We 	lack self-sacrifice. Everyone, to some extent, can do the work of 	spreading education. But everyone cannot work among the savarnas 	for the removal of Untouchability. Untouchability cannot be 	removed by delivering speeches. It will be removed only by the power 	of our self-sacrifice. In  such self- sacrifice, fasting has an 	important place. The fasts should be backed by discretion. Something 	could be done if competent Shastris is- sue public statements. What 	Barvejilibtech_430_footnotelibtech_431_footnotesays is not right. There can be no  	separate village for Harijans because they are an integral  part of 	society and yet outside it. They 	need wells, schools, etc., and if they are properly built and      
 if savarnas are allowed access to them, it would be one step towards eradication of untouchability. Abolition of untouchability has politi- cal implications but it must be pursued with a purely religious motive. It is a need of Hinduism. The answers to your more important ques- tions are as follows:
    Castes 			must go if we want 			to root 			out untouchability. 			Read my preface to Varnavyavasthalibtech_432_footnotelibtech_433_footnote.  I 			feel that if 			it becomes necessary 			we should 			continue special 			schools, wells, and so on.  Propaganda 			among the 			savarna Hindus 			is necessary. 			I have 			mentioned its 			limitations above.  If 			there is 			a conflict with the 			savarnas for 			securing the 			rights of Harijans, we must put up with it but secure them the rights.  The 			suggestion is 			good, but 			discretion will 			be necessary 			in [implementing] it. I 			consider the 			movement for 			temple-entry as necessary.  I 			do not 			know how 			far it is possible 			to have 			a meeting 			of Hindu 			leaders. But there 			should be such 			a meeting. The 			question of 			separate wells has 			already been dealt with.

 I have your letter of July 11. I read it twice. I then gave it to Kishorelalbhai. You probably know that he is an independent thinker.  I also send you what he has written. I would only say that I have always been as far as possible a slave of your love. The time has now come when the same love will separate me from you. I have not been able to explain myself. Kindly place this letter before the Standing Committee  of  the  Sammelanlibtech_451_footnotelibtech_452_footnote.  I   feel   that   the   Sammelan   has   not accepted my definition of Hindi. And now my ideas are moving further still in that direction. My definition of Rashtrabhasha includes a knowledge of Hindi and Urdu and both the Nagari and Persian scripts. Only thus can a fusion of Hindi and Urdu come about, if it will. I am afraid this suggestion of mine may not be welcome to the Sammelan. I therefore request that my resignation be accepted. Bypursuing the difficult task of propagating Hindustani I shall be serving both Hindi and Urdu.

  	When I fixed the amount of milk, there were no other institu- tions 	in the neighbourhood. Now that there are, it becomes our duty to 	sink or swim with them. We here cannot have the freedom that they 	enjoy. But we must apply the controls that they do. The doctors are 	engaged in formulating a standard. It will be published shortly. 	Just now you should reduce the quantity of milk as much as you 	conven- iently can. The final decision should be postponed till 	after Sushila- behn’s arrival. I should like to do without ghee 	altogether, but that does not seem desirable for vegetarians. 	Experience will be a better guide in this matter. Pulses cannot 	replace milk, but doctors believe that they are necessary in 	themselves. I am the only one to assert     
 emphatically that they are not necessary. We may, however, introduce them. The same about spices. Those who are under the Ashram vows cannot consume them for the pleasure of the palate, but if they are necessary for aiding digestion they may be used. It should be remem- bered that there are very few in the Ashram who have taken the vows.  I see no great trouble in having two separate cuisines—one with spices, the other without. We cannot compel anybody to observe the vow of controlling the palate, or any vow.
 While considering this matter, we should remember that though milk, ghee and fruit are consumed in greater quantity in the Ashram, illness persists. We must investigate the cause of this.
 If this does not give you the guidance that you need, ask me again. The problem of those who are ill is a different one.

483,"July 28, 1945","INTERVIEW TO “THE
HINDU”","
    
 WARDHAGANJ,
 July 28, 1945
 QUESTION: According to Dr. Pattabhi, the Desai-Liaqat Formula contemplated formation of a new government first, to be followed by the release of the members of the Congress Working Committee. This aspect of the Formula had been interpreted by some people as “bypassing the Congress” and by some others as “stabbing the Congress in the back”.
 You have stated in your statement issued from Panchgani that you blessed the Formula as you thought it provided a basis for communal settlement. It is generally believed that you were consulted at every stage of the agreement. Is theinterpretation put on the agreement that it bypassed the Congress correct?
ANSWER: I consider the question has been addressed to a wrong
 person. Parties to the Formula are the best persons to say what it meant. Then what you put into Dr. Pattabhi’s mouth, he may repudiate. I, therefore, suggest to all reporters at all times, but most specially at this time, to be precise and accurate in what they say. There never was the slightest intention on the part of Advocate Bhulabhai Desai, on whose behalf alone I can speak, “of stabbing the Congress in the back” or making an attempt to “bypass” the Con- gress. He, himself made politically by the Congress, could never be guilty of any such intention, and, for me, I should be committing suicide if I could be a party to any such attempt. I can say this much for Advocate Bhulabhai Desai that the only intention he had was that of honourably resolving the deadlock and thereby serving the Congress. It would be wrong to say that I was consulted “at every stage” but it would be strictly correct to say that Advocate Bhulabhai Desai saw me more than once about the ‘Pact’.
 Asked whether the release of the members of the Working Committee formed part of the agreement, whether it was agreed between the parties that the Muslim League alone should nominate the Muslim members of the new government and whether in view of so many statements and counter-statements on the subject it would not be desirable to release the Formula for publication, Gandhiji said:
I think, in the foregoing, I have said as much as I could, consis-
 tently with the fact that the ‘Pact’ has not seen the light of day. I wish that the parties had agreed to release it for publication.

511,,"WHY KHADI FOR YARN AND NOT FOR
MONEY?","
  
 July 1945
Sjt. Bharatan Kumarappa writes to me from his tours:
 People are asking what has Gandhiji done. He will kill khadi by insisting on yarn being given in exchange for it. What are we, who because of his teachings have vowed to put on only khadi, to do? We do not know how to spin neither do we want to learn it. Are we to go without khadi? This rule regarding yarn only shows Gandhiji’s obduracy.
 Sjt. Bharatan Kumarappa’s letter is in English. I have given its substance here.
 People will not find any obduracy in my demand if only they understood that non-violent swaraj depends on every drawing out of the yarn. On the contrary they will then find absorbing interest in it. Those who see only obduracy in it do not know how non-violence works. Since my return to India I have been crying myself hoarse that if we want to attain independence through non-violence spinning should be an essential part of our activity. The late Maulana Mohamed Ali used to say that the charkha was our rifle and the spindles of yarn our bullets; we shall attain swaraj only through. these bullets. This is as true today as when it was said.
 My experience tells me that if khadi is to become universal, both in cities and in villages, it should be made available only in exchange of yarn. Today one anna’s worth of yarn in the rupee is demanded. But this is only the beginning. When people have understood and learnt how to spin, then khadi will be given only in full exchange for yarn spun. I hope that as days go by everyone will himself insist on buying khadi only in exchange of yarn. If this does not happen and if they give yarn grudgingly swaraj through non-violence is impossible. Surely some effort has to be made for swaraj. It cannot be had by mere begging. A certain kind of freedom can of course be obtained on the strength of the rifle, but it will not be real swaraj and I for one am not interested in it.
 The very idea of obtaining swaraj through the rifle makes my head reel and a mountain of difficulties appears before my eyes. Thisarticle is not meant for those who would obtain swaraj through the rifle. Why should they wear khadi at all? From their point of view khadi can be proved to be quite a useless thing. Readers of this article
 should realize that if khadi is to be produced by villagers, not for their own use but for sale in cities, and if crores of villagers themselves are to use only mill cloth, then khadi will be of very little avail. How can we rest content if khadi merely puts a few coppers into the pockets of the poor?
 A doubt is raised that this new rule will kill the khadi which is now being produced by the poor and will make the wearing of khadi spun by themselves a matter of fashion only for a few select city- dwellers. This idea, however, displays ignorance.
 The masses do not eat for fashion but in order that they may live. Similarly they do not wear clothes for fashion, but for protection. Therefore the charkha, like the oven, should find a place in every house and every able-bodied person should spin. Then all can wear khadi and obtain swaraj. Able-bodied persons should spin also for the crippled and the weak. If games clubs demanding both energy and money can be run, as they are, why cannot swaraj clubs or charkha clubs be run where people can make slivers, spin and get khadi in exchange of yarn? The truth is that where there is no will, unfavour- able arguments present themselves and where there is a will, the will itself discovers favourable arguments. If the will is strong nobody will give up the charkha even as nobody leaves games. If the will can be found for games, can it not be found also for swaraj?
 A powerful argument advanced against the system of exchang- ing khadi for yarn is that if city people produce their own yarn the khadi produced by the poor will vanish and the little relief that has till now been given to them through khadi will stop, and the hope of seeing villagers clad in khadi produced by themselves will remain only a dream. Supposing city people give up wearing khadi out of laziness or anger and villagers give up spinning and weaving for want of demand, what great loss is it to the country? The poor people will take to other occupations in the place of khadi and will somehow make their living. Such people will not be found in crores but only in lakhs as at present. Those who are engaged in bidi-making earn four times what is possible through spinning, or even more. Many of the mill labourers have become rich. This means that those who are starving today will starve still further till they die, and the few of them who can earn well will ride roughshod over the rest. If more mills are increased and the number of cities is increased it will not make Indiaprosperous. On the other hand it will make crores die of starvation and of the many diseases produced by starvation. If city people are pleased with such a spectacle I have nothing to say. Then it
 will be the reign of violence, not of non-violence and truth, and I will admit that in that case khadi will have no place, it can have no place. Then military training will be compulsory whether we like it or not. But what I am talking about relates to the crores of  the  starving people. If they are to live, and live well, the charkha will have to be central and spinning undertaken voluntarily also by those who do not need to spin. The weapons of non-violence must not be adopted by people because they have no other alternative. Therefore to my mind the rule of yarn for khadi which has been introduced has to exist and increase in its application. Exactly for the same reason, if all the khadi bhandars have to be closed down and khadi-wearers give up khadi I will regard it as a triumph of truth, because then I shall understand that people had no belief in non-violence and that if they wore khadi they did it out of ignorance and thereby merely deceived themselves into thinking that by wearing khadi they would somehow get swaraj. Why should I thus allow people to deceive themselves when I know that such khadi will not bring swaraj and that it will be discarded after swaraj is obtained? In that case the prophecy of the late Chintamanilibtech_490_footnotewill come true that on Gandhi’s death people will laugh at khadi and also at him and will burn his body with the charkhas they may have in their houses. If hand-spun yarn cannot represent non-violence, why should I not retrieve my error while I am still alive and save the wood used in the charkhas? But I do not regard that prophecy as true. People have understood that the crores of India  cannot  obtain freedom through violence. India occupies or will soon occupy a great place in the world. That will be possible only through non-violence. If the crores of our people want to demonstrate the workability of non-violence they can do it only by making the charkha central. As the desire for freedom is strong amongst city-folks it is their duty to understand this and to take to spinning and khadi-wearing in order to obtain non-violent swaraj.

 SEVAGRAM,
 August 1, 1945
 BHAI KAKUBHAI,
 I have your letter. Chi. Kanu has given me the details in writing, but I shall not go into them. All this misunderstanding arose because I could not explain myself fully.
 “God has tied me with a cotton thread. Whichever way he pulls me I am His. I am pierced by the dagger of love.” This is from a famous bhajan of Mirabai. Swaraj hangs by that thread; it does not snap because the weight is that of love. The languages of India are full of allegories featuring yarn. Narandas has conceived of a yarn bank. If such a bank is organized well, it will ultimately beat the money banks. Narandas is a supreme devotee of khadi. None among us can beat him in his tapascharya. He has no other work. I am a witness to the work he has done for the charkha. I am a lover of his work. He has added immensely to the importance of  Rentia Baraslibtech_492_footnotelibtech_493_footnote. It is not a work of Kathiawaris alone and this time Kathiawaris alone are not to do it. In this scheme the Charkha Sangh was to play a major role and its benefit would have been also quite large. Chi. Kanu after finishing his work in Bombay was to proceed further. Collection of funds was Of secondary importance. Yarn was the main thing. The Charkha Sangh had to collect only the yarn delivered at its door and send the acknowledgement to Narandas’s bank. The ownership of the yarn would have certainly remained with the Charkha Sangh. Suppose yarn worth crores of rupees was produced, the Charkha Sangh would have got it without striving. Chi. Kanu is a child, an errand boy. He is not a leader. He could not explain what he wanted to say. From what he says he did not absent himself so as to humiliate you. This thing was such that there was no need for explanation. Goddess Lakshmi was to come to your door to bless you. However, what has happened has happened. I do not think it can be rectified. Do whatever you can. I had reckoned that Kanu would go from house to house,  revivespinning, repair charkhas, enrol volunteers, collect yarn, and that well-tied bales of yarn would be heaped at your place.
 
 If I have succeeded in explaining to you the scheme, then I can say that I have compensated for the long letter you wrote to me.
 I understand about the processes of cotton. Dawn is when one wakes up.

Cloth 	shortage you can deal with without delay by following the policy 	laid down by the All-India Spinners’ Association which is 	represented in Bengal too. In one sentence the scheme is to ask 	every home practically to spin its cotton and every village to weave 	its own cloth. It is the largest co-operative effort that can be 	conceived in the world.  	The second is the cattle question. For that you should meet Shri 	Satis Chandra Das Gupta of Khadi Pratishthan. He is ailing andmay 	not be available just now.

The financial 	help we are at present giving to such relatives for their 	maintenance and education is something different. In my opinion if 	we go by truth and non-violence we cannot give such assistance. How 	can we say that all of them died for the country, that they 	sacrificed themselves for the cause of swaraj?

 CHI. MADHAVDAS,
 Dr. Krishnavarma has sent all the reports about you. Kunvarjilibtech_520_footnotehas  also  written   a   postcard.   Dr.   Krishnavarma   has   no   interest in keeping you. He has  kept  you  only  for  my sake.  He  kept  Sailen also in the same way. Your good lies in remaining underDr. Krishnavarma’s treatment and following his instructions. I think I know Dr. Krishnavarma’s virtues and failings. For his failings he will be answerable to God. I see and cling to his virtues. Many allegations are made against him. Who is immune to them? I do not care for such allegations. I have seen with my own eyes how he looked after Ba. I think he had seen Ba’s virtues and became a great admirer of hers. The knowledge that you are Ba’s brother prompts him to keep you and look after you. You need not worry about how much you will have to pay him. The doctor has told me that he does not want a single pie, but I have decided that, if you agree, I shall pay him what I think proper from out of your own possessions. I have discussed this with Manilal too. But if you are not willing to pay a single pie, well, a lot of money has already been spent over you and this will be some more. It will be to the good if you get well and can live a normal life. However, Ba’s last words to me about you were: “You have done what you could for Madhavdas, I did what I could as his sister, and made you do what you could for him. Now you need not do anything for
 
 
 him.” This is what she said about you and Harilal. I know that these words proceeded from her anger, but also from her love. I have not, therefore, obeyed those words literally. Now do what you wish, with God, whom you believe you worship every day, as witness. Of one thing you may be sure, that I will not be able to keep you in the Ashram, nor can I cure you. And remember also that no relation will be able to accommodate you. Society is so constituted that  even though a person may wish to do something he is not able to do it, cannot do it. Ultimately, everyone has to turn to God, and only what He does or permits is possible. If you can think, then after reading this letter stay where you are. If you cannot think, then also, do not do anything in a hurry but stay there. May God bless you.

 August 4, 1945
 BHAI KRISHNAVARMA,
 Please read the enclosed letter and then pass it on to Mama. I read your whole letter yesterday, till then I was not able fully to go through it. I agree with what you say. I have given Mama some idea of you in my letter to him. I had observed even when you were here that you had no control over your tongue. You do not observe the rules of cleanliness—maybe, you do not even know them. I  had noticed that also when you were here. I presume you are doing the same there. Kanti Mashruwala is an admirer of yours. Manilal had been there. He is not an admirer of you but he is wise. He has seen something of the world. He recognizes your qualities. He believes that you are no doubt good at heart but he also believes that you do not observe the rules of cleanliness nor make others do so. I only know your goodness and therefore wish that your  shortcomings may disappear. I know that I have served my own interest in sending Mama to you and I still want to keep him there. He will be in a very bad plight if he goes away from there. I cannot keep him in the Ashram, as it will be against the spirit of the Ashram. I do not think he can stay anywhere else. Whatever has to be done, you alone can do. As you have started a hospital it certainly is your duty. Follow nature-cure
 methods at the hospital. You must know the rules of cleanliness and observe them meticulously. There are too many mosquitoes there. Just because you are taking work from the poor women you should not put up with their indifferent performance. As a doctor and a householder it is your duty to teach them cleanliness. It should be your job to eradicate mosquitoes from the neighbourhood.  You  should know how to do that. How can you call yourself a nature-cure doctor if you do not do all these things? I can write much along these lines but I am sure you are one of those to whom a word is enough. For this reason and also because I do not have the time I am not prolonging the letter.
 I understand about Sailen. Encash the cheque he has sent to you. I won’t think it is your fee by any means. I know you did notkeep Sailen for the sake of fee. But I thought he should on his own put into the charity box whatever he could afford and therefore asked him to send the cheque. Get the cheque cashed and utilize the money for charity. I do not advise you to come here. The main reason of course is that I do not have the time. Otherwise I would be happy if I could keep you here and give you training in cleanliness. But that is not possible at the moment. I shall call you when such an occasion arises. However, if you want to come on your own, want to be reassured and if you do come, it will be a different matter.

 CHI. KUNVARJI,
 I have your postcard. You write that Mama should be allowed to go where he wants. I do not understand this, nor does Manilal. Where will he go? Where will he stay? Are you going to keep him? If you think he can stay in the Ashram, that is not possible. Have you considered what would happen if he were to go and stay in his own house? Mama has gone to Malad of his own free will. When he asked me to send him to Malad I was not willing to do so. I requested Dr. Krishnavarma when Manilal pleaded on his behalf. It requires but one moment to remove him from there, but I believe that it would harm
 him. However, I will do whatever all of you tell me. But remember that afterwards I shall not be able to do anything. I am convinced that in doing so I am acting in an objective spirit and in accordance with dharma. At present Manilal is at Akola. He writes to say that he will be coming here on Monday with his wife and children. I will discuss the matter with him, too.
I hope all of you are well."

  	Several Congressmen have asked me questions relating to the Congress 	programme. Cablegrams too have been received from London and other 	places. I am sorry I have not been able to acknowledge them. The 	reason, however, is and should be obvious. In the absence of the 	Maulana Saheb and other members of the Working Committee, it is true 	I took upon myself the responsibility to give such advice as I was 	capable of giving in regard to Congress matters.  	Now that the Working Committee is out, I can only give advice 	through the Maulana Saheb and the Working Committee. My advice, 	independently given, may be in conflict with their opinion and it 	may embarrass them and even put them or me in a wrong position and, 	what is more, may confuse the public mind. Therefore, I should warn 	all here and outside India against making any reference to me on 	such questions as are properly for the President and the Working 	Com- mittee to advise upon.

  	Both of you should learn non-attachment from the service of Harilal. 	Through non-attachment devotion to someone can be transformed into 	devotion to God. If such devotion is not linked with devotion to 	God, it becomes infatuation and assumes a dangerous form. You two 	have spared no effort in the service of Harilal. I had felt all 	along that Harilal would ultimately act as he had always done. But 	let not this worry you in the least. You should be thankful if even 	the last rites fell to your lot to perform. You have shown devotion 	in many ways. All that devotion will have achieved fulfilment if now 	you turn it into devotion to God. And true devotion to God as I see 	itnow is devotion to  Sutranarayanalibtech_525_footnotelibtech_526_footnote. The word  Daridranarayanalibtech_527_footnotelibtech_528_footnotewas 	first used by Vivekananda (if my memory serves me right, for I am 	not quite sure whether it was he or some other holy man who used it 	first).

Rise above the 	intrigues there or anywhere else. If you do not show the slightest 	softness to Harilal, he will leave Mysore. Try to find out, if you 	can, how he managed to obtain Rs. 200 from the Maharaja of Mysore.  	You may tell me, when we meet, the other things which you have on 	your mind.

         CHI. 	RAMDAS,     August 	5, 1945 
  	You have used reasoning in your letter which, however, does not 	appeal to me. You have a right to go to Dinshaw’s because he has 	made you his own. Dinshaw is imbued with the spirit of altruism, 	even towards the poorest. His is not an organization for the poor. 	Similarly it is not for the rich. However, both can go there as also 	those belonging to the middle class; that is possible because of 	Dinshaw’s good nature. Moreover, you had no right to use reasoning 	the way you have, for you had given me to understand that you were 	about to take long leave, or had taken it, and would be devoting a 	year to improving your health. Of course you will have yourself 	treated there and think of going to Dinshaw only after you have 	completely ruined your health. As you will yourself admit you could 	not perceive Dinshaw’s love for you. I therefore even now advise 	you to take oneyear’s leave and go to Dinshaw’s. As I have 	already told you, I shall manage to find your one year’s expenses 	from somewhere. I shall not pay from the Ashram funds but seek money 	for you from somewhere. I have forgotten what arrangement was made 	about the expenditure. However, explain that to me again and I will 	act accordingly. You have something that attracts older persons to 	you. I myself do not know what it is but I have firsthand knowledge 	of it. Dinshaw knows many of my people but he is not drawn to them. 	But he is attracted to you. Most probably you yourself do not know 	why that is so. This is one of the instances. I have many others in 	my mind. It would therefore be better if you did not argue over the 	matter and went to Dinshaw’s. If you both want to go you may. It 	will be enough for you to wind up the establishment from there for 	one year. There are numerous teaching institutions in Poona. Kanam 	and Usha won’t have any difficulty in learning Marathi if they 	have to.  	Manilal and Sushila will be arriving tomorrow. Sita will stay on in 	Akola. She is engrossed in her studies.  	I am still of the opinion that Nimulibtech_532_footnotelibtech_533_footnotedid 	well in not going either to Delhi or to Simla. There is no point in 	making Sumilibtech_534_footnotelibtech_535_footnotedependent on     
 you. I can understand parents’ attachment. However, this time I have seen that neither Nimu nor you could have done anything more for Sumi than what Devdas and Lakshmi did for her. I noticed that they looked after Sumi in the same way as they look after their own children. Sumi gave me the impression that she also held the same view. She is quite at home with the children there. Ultimately, isn’t God the Protector of all?

  	I notice that even now you do not worship pure truth. You do not 	even fulfil the promises you gave me. What is the meaning of your 	pining for Nimu when you have accepted Devdas and Lakshmi as your 	parents? They of course treat you accordingly. We should be content 	with the situation in which we place ourselves or are placed. For 	the sake of the love Devdas and Lakshmi cherish for you, you must 	protect your health, your eyes. Why should you put yourself through 	the strain of an examination? Why should you force yourself to 	finish a specified course within a specified time? You have to 	preserve your eyes, your intellect and your body in order to 	continue with your studies. This is such an obvious truth that it 	does not need any explanation. It is self-evident. Hence the 	Gujarati saying:  the health of the body is the first happiness. So 	allay Ramdas’s and Nimu’s fears by studying without becoming 	restless and improving your health. Bring credit to the love Devdas 	and Lakskmi have for you and be worthy of it. I absolve you from 	your pledge of writing to    
 me. Write to me only when you feel enthused and when it is convenient. Do not write to me by straining your eyes and neglecting your studies. I only desire that you should become ever more pure in body and mind. It is for this reason alone that I expect letters from you.

I am sure you will have realized by now that one has to reply to 	points which strike one’s eye.   Since 		you are 		the Manager, you 		should treat 		nothing as 		private.  This 		reply is meant 		for all. 		If you 		wish, you 		may treat your 		letter as private.

You cannot 		claim greater right or 		control over 		Kanchan than 		over the other 		women.

Lanterns too 	should be 	shared as 	far as 	possible. Even 	if he is ready 	to pay 	for them, we 	cannot give 	any just now. It 	is desirable that 	we should 	make some arrangement 	for light 	on the paths. 	Discuss this with Kanaiyo and 	Mohansinh. All 	those who 	wish to 	read should do 	so silently round 	one or 	two lamps. 	And the 	same for writing. 	We must 	economize on 	kerosene. Issue 	a ticket 	for Ramnarayan. 	He should 	not be 	made to 	carry too 	heavy a 	financial burden. 	All the expenses 	must be 	managed within Rs. 	150. Everyone should be 	given local fruit and 	Bombay fruit should be 	reserved for 	the sick. 	I intend 	to make 	some arrangements. 	Estimate the 	cost of fruit 	from Bombay. You 	should exercise 	discretion, moderation and 	gentleness in this matter.  In 	order to 	know a 	man’s nature we 	must learn 	to tolerate 	his weaknesses as we 	expect the world to tolerate ours. If the world did 	not tolerate 	our weaknesses 	it would 	kill us. This applies 	to all, 	but it applies 	especially to the 	Manager who 	has embraced ahimsa.  After 	you have 	finalized the set-up 	to your 	satisfaction, hand it 	over to 	somebody else 	to administer 	according to 	plan. Let the 
 
 person you have in view get trained from now on, not for exercising authority but for service. I believe that such an administrator can be, ought to be, a woman. Any upright and hard-working man or woman can run a well-planned organization. Take it that those who cannot do so have some shortcomings.

 MY DEAR ATULANAND,
 R[aj] K[umari] has sent me your letter to her. You are right about me. Your way is different from mine. But I have countenanced you as you have appealed to me as an earnest man. In spite of the testimonials you have quoted often, you have not made progress not because Congressmen have not appreciated your labours but because your unity plan has made no appeal to the general mind. But this is a long story. I suggest to you to look inward for your failure and not outward. Why not do some concrete work, be it ever so little? And then there will be no failure. For concrete work is its own success. I have not written this for argument but, if possible, to enable you to see the light.
 Yours sincerely,

BAPU  SHRIMATI 	RAJKUMARI 	SIMLA  From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         [Before August 8, 1945]libtech_547_footnote  This 	is what the Editor of the Gram 	Udyog Patrika tells 	me:  I 	am afraid your last articlelibtech_548_footnotein regard to why 	people should give yarn for khadi is not convincing. Your whole 	argument rests on the view, which is repeated several times in the 	course of your article, that non-violent swaraj is impossible unless 	everybody spins. This crucial point, however, is never explained, 	but taken for granted and asserted repeatedly. Unless you can show        
 what connection there is between non-violent swaraj and the people of all kinds—even those who have more profitable occupation—taking to the charkha for their cloth requirements, your argument cannot convince those who honestly feel that your asking them to spin, if they want to use khadi, even when their time can be spent more profitably, is to expect a little too much from them. So can you perhaps provide this missing link in your argument for the next issue, and show how through spinning we can obtain non-violent swaraj?
The better course this time is to answer in English. Few, if any,
 readers who do not know English would ask for the “missing link”, for the very simple reason that, they know my argument showing the connection between hand-spinning and swaraj obtained through non-violence. Swaraj can only be obtained by work, either violent or non-violent. Violent work we know. It necessarily includes training in the use of the most modern weapons of destruction and all it means. By common consent this has been ruled out. Mere constitutional means, though non-violent, went out of date long ago. It is a superstition to think that liberty can be gained by such means in the teeth of armed opposition. Non-violent work is then the only means for winning freedom. What is the training or work that Indians should undertake for adapting themselves for non-violent efforts? It has been shown that Indian freedom was lost when India’s chief trade in cotton fabric, which was prepared in her cottages, was destroyed and together with it many other occupations which Indians carried on to sustain that trade. It is obvious that that trade and the allied occupations should be revived or some others consistent with non-violence should be taken up. Revival was the only thing thought of. It was being attempted by way of copying the English or, say, the modern method of replacing human labour by means of power-driven machinery. Instinctively I rejected it [as] being a way of violence and sought to replace it  by  human  labour  [as]  being  a  way  of  non-violence.  The struggle between the two is going on. In my opinion, the war that is ending has demonstrated the bankruptcy of violence. Solvency of non-violence remains to be proved. Revival of the central trade of India by means of power-driven machinery is possible only by a superior exhibition of the resourcefulness of the West. And, if it becomes possible, it will find the masses of India no better off than now. I advance no argument in proof of this proposition. For, it can be studied through  a  perusal  of  my  writings  already  published  in
 book formlibtech_549_footnotelibtech_550_footnote.
 Then the only form of non-violent work to be done by the largest number of men, women and children of the land, in order to regain the lost trade with its attendant activities, is the spinning-wheel. Thus conceived, it easily becomes the symbol par excellence of non-violence. To be an instrument of swaraj, naturally it must not flourish under Government or any other patronage. It must flourish, if need be, even in spite of the resistance from Government or the capitalist who is interested in his spinning and weaving mills. The spinning-wheel represents the millions in the villages as against the classes represented by the mill-owners and the like.
 “Assuming,” the Editor asks, “that the wheel is designed to bring in swaraj non-violently, why should a person who is more usefully occupied or even disinclined spin?” The reason is more psychological than utilitarian. The villagers have become used to imitating the city-dwellers so much so that the movement is towards migration to the city slums instead of remaining in and improving their own lot in the villages. If every person sets apart, for the sake of winning swaraj non-violently, a certain time for hand-spinning, an atmosphere for spinning will be created and if khadi became an article for personal use instead of being an article of commerce, which it now largely is, the question of competition with mill-cloth or any other cloth will disappear and the poorest as well as the richest will be able to wear and use khadi without the slightest difficulty. No wonder Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru has called it “the livery of our freedom”.libtech_551_footnote

  	I have your letter. I am in two minds about whether you should or 	should not go to the Tilak Vidyapith. And therefore it is best that 	I should express no definite opinion. -We do not wish to enter into 	controversy over the Vedas. The compositions that are today accepted 	as the Vedas are full of unresolved doubts. Not all the writings 	have come down to us. Even from among those which have, no one knows 	what is genuine and what is not. As regards their interpretation, 	sheerconfusion prevails. Hence the judgment about goodness or 	badness can come only from a purified conscience. I have, therefore, 	taken as my guide the sloka cited by Anandshankarbhailibtech_563_footnotein his book:     
 
 
 I do not even know from where he has quoted the sloka. It appealed to me instantly and sank into my heart, and I, therefore, got it included in the women’s prayer. Also please remember that we got the marriage of the Harijan girl Lakskmi and Harijan Velayudhan performed according to the rite that we had accepted. I do not remember the names of other Harijans. But all this I consider irrelevant. If I am right in my statement that the regeneration of Hinduism lies in our becoming Harijans, then it is very clear that a change must be made in the marriage rite in all weddings taking place in the Ashram or the ones with my blessings. Since I have already agreed, Indu and Tendulkar should be married in the Ashram. I am not bound as regards the rite, and, therefore, the new rite should be introduced from this wedding. I am giving all this additional information here simply by way of background. You may, if you wish, discuss this matter with him. You may discuss it with Vinobaji also, and then prepare as short a text of the ceremony as possible. Remember that this must be finalized before I leave. I assume that you also will be accompanying me. I saw the other photograph of Ballibtech_564_footnotelibtech_565_footnote, and recognized him. Now let us see where we land.

FOR FUNDSlibtech_566_footnote","
         August 	8, 1945  	I have gone through the appeallibtech_567_footnotelibtech_568_footnoteof 	the trustees. I like it. I hope that the entire amount they have 	asked for in it will be available through contributions. I feel that 	much has been done for the propagation of Hindustani in the southern 	provinces and hope that even more will be done in the future. People 	should contribute on the understanding that the money thus raised 	will be used for furthering the cause of the national language as I 	have defined it. The national language as explained in the appeal is 	a language written in the Urdu or Hindi style and in the Nagari or 	Urdu script. This means that the Hindi written solely in the 	Devanagari script cannot be called national language, nor can the 	language written solely in the Persian script. The true Hindustani 	will be evolved only when we, who know the national language, are 	able to write it in both the scripts and speak in both the dictions. 	There can be no doubt that even today millions of Hindus and Muslims 	in the North speak such a language, such Hindustani. However, we 	cannot say that educated people of the North speak such Hindustani. 	If it has to be our misfortune that such a state of affairs should 	continue, then it will continue, but it should be our     
 hope that it will come to an end soon. This can be the only meaning of propagating Hindustani. Therefore the work of propagating Hindustani which is going on in South India will emphasize both the styles. And that is the meaning of the resolution which the Congress passed in 1925libtech_569_footnotelibtech_570_footnote. The resolution was:
 This Congress resolves that the proceedings of the Congress, A.I.C.C. and the Congress Working Committee shall ordinarily be conducted in Hindustani. The English language or any other provincial language may be used if the speaker is unable to speak in Hindustani or whenever necessary. Proceedings of the Provincial Congress Committeeshall ordinarily be conducted in the language of the province concerned. Hindustani may also be used.

I  do  not consider it improper in any way. While going in for Nayee Talim, she is free to send the girls elsewhere whenever she feels like it. If they want to be educated there at present, you  must  stay  somewhere nearby. You will go to the Goshala when the building is ready in four to six months’ time. Since no other accommodation is available itwould be better if it can be found in the Ashram as was done in the case   of   Prabhakar.   I   have   written   to   Munnalal   to   that   effect.libtech_575_footnotePrabhakar used to cook his own food. I did not make this applicable to you because I thought that except for the education of Sita and Subhadra you and Anjana Devi had a preference for the Ashram life. Therefore I felt you would not need to cook separately. But now I understand from your letter that you do not like the system at the Ashram. If that is so the Ashram life must be something different. But  I don’t think it is so. Understand that if the life and routine in the Ashram cause you discomfort you both, or at least Anjana Devi, will not be able to stay here in peace. Your cooking separately will hurt me and irritate the managers. It should not be necessary to convince you on this point. Hence, consider the matter well and do whatever you think best. It is your duty to understand the limitations of those running the Ashram.

I think you ought to write to 	your elders and seek their permission.  	I assume also that this marriage will not be for indulgence but for 	service. I assume further that until real independence is achieved 	you will not consummate your marriage. And of course I take it for 	granted that you will not take to contraceptive methods.  	I need not say that if you find all this hard you should not feel 	obliged to have the marriage solemnized here.  	If you approve of a marriage of this type, do regular spinning, 	study the 12th Chapter of the Gita with interest and 	understanding, and think only of public good while working in the 	Ashram.  	Remember that in drafting this rite I have not taken the law into 	consideration.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: C.W. 10946. Courtesy: Indumati G.

 If both of you want to have protection of the law you may have [the marriage] registered. Devdas has done it. So has Kanu. I never wanted it, but the girls’ fathers were keen on it.
 I have only expressed an opinion. I never pay any attention to the law in whatever I do. We may regard Prabhakar as more than a Brahmin, but what can we do if society and the law would  not recognize him?

           SEVAGRAM, 
  August 11, 1945 Those like 	me, who were interested in saving Mahendra Chowdhary from the 	gallows, are, I know, shocked that he was hanged at 	the Central  Jail  in   Bhagalpur  on  August  7.   Those  who  	remain  	behind will have to know that many more such tragedies will take 	place. Only, we must learn the lesson of each. Let us, then, now 	dispassionately learn the lesson of this accomplished death 	sentence.  	First, the Government. They do not call it a political dacoity. 	Every dacoity is not a political act. Many professionals used the 	political ferment for their own ends. Government, whether truly 	national or foreign, would not let such crimes go unpunished. The 	authorities, in this case, held Mahendra Chowdhary to be implicated 	in such a dacoity and, therefore, they allowed the sentence to take 	the extreme course. Now, for the popular side. They say that 	Mahendra Chowdhary was a young man of twenty-five. He had no idea of 	taking part in a dacoity whether professional or political, 	so-called. He was in hiding. He was tried after the event and 	sentenced on doubtful evidence.Acceptance of the evidence and the 	verdict depended on the whim of the judge or judges and at the time 	judges were, as often as not, biased.    
 If the popular belief is founded on fact, the death was a murder, worse, reprehensible because judicial. Who can find the truth, except a body of utterly impartial lawyers? They have to do so from the recorded evidence and the judgements of the original and appellate courts. Let us neither be carried away by sentiment nor lazily forget the incident, now that Mahendra Chowdhary is no more. If Government at all care for public opinion and would not rest on the overwhelming force they have at their disposal, they will be equally interested, and will associate themselves with the public.

         August 	11, 1945  CHI. 	MUNNALAL,  	Read the accompanying letter. I like it. Kanchan writes what she 	feels. I think it is necessary that she should be satisfied.

In my opinion this is no small matter. Know that I had expressed the same desire in the case of every other wedding. But they were all young girls with the exception of Saundaram.

 This is a different matter. When you say that I laid down a condition which was not there earlier, I maintain that I have stipulated no such condition. This is why I made the inquiry.

610,"August 14, 1945","DISCUSSION WITH B.
S. MURTHYlibtech_603_footnote","
         [Before August 14, 1945]libtech_604_footnote  	I can give you advice only as from one individual to another. I am 	not giving any advice to the Harijan Sevak Sangh which is an 	institution. After all the Harijan Sevak Sangh is only as good as 	the best men in it and I know how few they are. The Sangh has done 	substantial work, though not in the estimation of the Harijans or in 	the estimation of the orthodox Hindus. The Harijans may want to 	smash the caste Hindus and the caste Hindus may want to cling to the 	old way. The Sangh has to face both these.  	You have asked me how the Sangh can be revitalized. I know the royal 	way is a fast by me. I might fast again and that more readily for 	Harijans than for anything else. But I must wait till God asks me to 	do it. There is no such thing as a forced fast. It has to come and I 	cannot say now when it will come. I must also tell you that there 	are others who want to fast for the Harijans. But I have told them 	that they are not to fast while I am alive. I have also the idea of 	a chain of fasts. In such a chain I will fast first and then when my 	body has perished, the next fast will begin and it will go on till 	untouchability is no more. Such a fast is conceived, but it cannot 	be taken up at once as I said it has to come. But before even such a 	thing happens a lot of spade work has to be done. That is why 	Harijan Sevak Sangh workers are     
 meeting here soon. They are meeting for the very purpose of revitalizing the Sangh’s work.
 The present feeling among the Harijan Sevak Sangh workers is that practically nothing has been done among  caste  Hindus. Education of Harijans is one thing; education of Savarnas is another and as I know more difficult. You can educate Harijans by giving them scholarships, hostels, etc., but no such way is possible among the caste Hindus. The task, therefore, is to educate the savarnas. But this can be done only by those who are fired by a living faith in the Hinduism which I understand. Only those who fully know the meaningof Hinduism as I know it can perform the miracle. Let us not forget that untouchability is a most difficult thing to remove and that our task is a heavy one. But I have no doubt that God will remove untou-chability or remove Hinduism.
 Now in regard to your question on the political future of Harijans, I certainly see that those Harijans who have become poli- tically conscious should straightaway have a full opportunity to figure in politics. You have asked me what I mean by saying that I want such Harijans to be more than a match for all other political competitors. Many people weigh the Harijans in some special Harijan balance. But  I want to weigh the Harijans in the same balance in which I weigh the best. You have to outweigh others because you have to cover so much lost distance. That is why I expect from the Harijans greater effort than from others.
 You have asked me whether Dr. Ambedkar has in my opinion thus proved himself to be more than a match. My answer is ‘Yes’ and ‘No’. Dr. Ambedkar is a fierce and fearless man. He does not scruple to beat the Hindu dog with any stick he can get. He wants to destroy Hinduism. It is open to him to do it. If the Harijans want to do it they can do it. Then the Harijans must become the destroyers of Hinduism.  I want Harijans to become as able and earnest as Dr. Ambedkar but in  a different way. I want you to do even better. I want you to produce sterling men who will reshape the whole of our society. It is not enough to be educated. It is necessary to be cultured and fearless. Such men who will reshape society will have to work among the people and not cut themselves away from the people. They will have to be stern, incorruptible and self-reliant. There is nothing to prevent such people from taking any assistance from clean quarters. But my point is the more you lean on such assistance, the more difficult becomes the task of uplifting the Harijans.

			SANGH","
         WARDHA,  August 14, 1945 Gandhiji said that only caste Hindus and no Harijan should be taken on the Executive of the Sangh, as it was the caste Hindus who had to atone for their sin of  prolonging 	untouchability. Harijans could be members of the supervision 	committee that might be set up for carrying on the work properly.  Replying 	to a question, Gandhiji said that he would appreciate the principle 	of satyagraha for enforcing the civic rights of Harijans in public 	places like tanks, wells, temples, etc. He, however, emphasized that 	the Harijan Sevak Sangh as an organization should not be involved in 	such a satyagraha. Individual Harijan workers might try that remedy 	with the help of others.  Gandhiji 	explained to the members how Harijan work was to be carried on. 	Persistent propaganda for changing the hearts of the orthodox and 	caste Hindus, hesaid, would greatly help to solve the problem of 	untouchability which was a stigma on Hinduism.  To 	create confidence among Harijans, Mahatma Gandhi went on, Harijan workers had to live 	amidst Harijans, mix with them, study their local and other       
 problems and try to solve them to their satisfaction. The workers should live like the Harijans “so that they can feel that you are one of them”.
 Gandhiji emphasized the need for more intensive work for the uplift of  Harijans and called for more workers. It was a very vast work and needed great patience, energy, time and money, he said.

 I do not infer from your letter that you are writing about my ‘Hindus’. Whatever you have in your heart has not come in your writing. But do not worry about it. When we meet next we will talk over it if you so desire. Whatever you want to say about the communal problem should not be said without consulting the Working Committee. I am also of the opinion that it would be better to be quiet. The party can give its opinion after consultation with you. They have a right to do so. Besides it is their duty. I differ from your opinion. I can not say if I attach importance to the words ‘Hindu’ and ‘Mussalman’. Whatever the Congress does is a different thing. At one time I do not like ‘Hindu’ and at another time I do not like ‘Mussalman’. It means there cannot be either. All this needs pondering over.

I certainly do not like to leave the newly arrived girls and go away, but I am helpless. You should know how to make them work. I will try to discuss the matter with Deo.
 Ramnarayan will leave on the 18th. You should ponder over Krishnachandra’s letter. Why does he and others form such an impression? One should hear what one’s co-workers say. One may even sacrifice much for their sake.

  	I do not believe that agriculture alone will bring self-reliance. We 	should become self-reliant through the handicrafts we take up. I 	grant that in the very first year we cannot become  self-reliant. 	However, when we complete the entire process the expenditure and the 	income should balance. I would not call agriculture a handicraft. 	But it is an occupation of crores of people. It does not encourage 	skill but it does give a lot of physical exercise. It has been 	accorded its rightful place after seven years. It is a sad thing 	that we have been divided into two groups but that is inevitable. We 	regard constructive work as a symbol of ahimsa while others look 	upon it as a means of furthering their work. And that only to the 	extent that if they can do without itthey will do so. Even if the 	intention is good I find lack of wisdom in such an attitude. 
 Your health causes me worry. You must get rid of your leg trouble. Steam treatment is one of the treatments. Massage is worth trying. I believe that one who neglects the body betrays the soul. Is not the body an abode of the atman? And therefore it requires the utmost care.

  	I have your letter. I am sending your letters to Agatha Harrison and 	Krishna Menon, by air mail. I see from these that all those 	sentenced to death are classed as political prisoners. Can this view 	sustain? During the upheaval a few criminals indulged in foul deeds. 	Can they be described as political? Then what the Huns did in Sind 	should similarly be described as political. All these things  are 	weighing on my mind. Even so I do not hold back your  letter, 	because I have not been given any choice and it is  addressed  to 	Agatha Harrison. The second letter you have forgotten to sign. 	However, I am forwarding it to Krishna Menon. The truth is that 	capital punishment is bad in itself and it should be abolished.  	I have no hope of anything good coming out of it. We must understand 	the system. The Viceroy wields supreme power. So if we are not able 	to achieve anything here we might as well wash our hands of the 	whole thing. They cannot run the administration in any other way. We 	should therefore do whatever is possible only here. Our last resort 	is public opinion. Public opinion, in this matter, is evidently not 	able to do much and when it does achieve something it is not as 	effective as it should be. I have stated what can be done about 	Mahendra   Chowdhary   after   the   execution.libtech_617_footnotelibtech_618_footnoteI 	  hope   you   have gonethrough my statement and will have it 	implemented in whatever way you can.

But I did not wish to reply to your letter without 	showing it to others. For, though I had written a long letter to 	you, you remained convinced in your mind regarding your demand. I 	did not, therefore, think it proper to write to you on my own. 	Yourletter has now been read by Jajuji, Chhaganlallibtech_623_footnote, Krishnadaslibtech_624_footnoteand       
 Kan-aiyo. They all agree with me. Jajuji has even written down his view. I send it with this. He has described his own experience. I am confident that a person like you is bound to have  the  same  experience. “Swaraj will be gained through yarn,” I said, relying on intuition. But I realize now that intuition is one thing and its confirmation by experience another. And what I have been putting forward now is something different still. Others are having more convincing experience of the same. It is not going to impress me at all even if in Kathiawar khadi worth Rs. 4 lakhs instead of Rs. 2 lakhs is produced and sold. For it could be proved that such production and sale of khadi would only promote the welfare of the poor, and an all-India institution like the Charkha Sangh need not be established merely for that purpose. A co-operative of the poor for producing khadi could be established and more khadi at still lower cost could be produced. But even then that khadi would be of value only as khadi for the poor. It would, one may say, make no contribution to the cause of swaraj. I, therefore, desire that you should have perfect self-confidence and adopt this new method—policy—for khadi and discover from experience that it is khadi for swaraj. It is quite possible that Kathiawar may not accept such khadi. If so, don’t mind if no khadi work is done there, for you must be aware that no such work is done in many Indian States. In the same way if no work is done in Kathiawar, either, the cause of khadi for swaraj would not suffer. I go even further and say that in carrying on khadi activity for swaraj, if it ceases to be khadi for the poor, the latter are not going  to  lose anything for they will be able to earn their bread in some other way. But if khadi supports the poor even while remaining khadi for the swaraj, it would be a credit both to the poor and the cause of swaraj. The poor thereby would have contributed to the winning of swaraj. If  I have left any point unexplained, Kanaiyo will explain it when he arrives there.
 I hope your health is perfect. If you can leave that place, it might be better for you to come and see me once.

 We  cannot  accept   even   one   of   the   three   conditions.libtech_625_footnoteEven though we believe that it is an inflammatory speech, constructive activity has no relation at all with movements such as that of 1942. Even if we denounce the violent activities of Shri Jayaprakash Narayan, we cannot accept any of these three conditions, that is to say, we cannot compel the workers to respect them. If the independence of India is common cause between us and the Government then what is the meaning of all these differences?
 The truth is that the Bihar Government has made a mistake in making the arrests but instead of acknowledging the mistake it wants to put the responsibility on us. We will not accept the responsibility even if they should wipe us out. Let them stop our peaceful activities. We shall still go forward.

  	I have your two letters: one about Labanya Kumar and the other about 	my going there.  	I have met Labanya Kumar and have written  about  the engineers. He 	has also seen things here.  	Now about my visit. I have said I will go. I have also been told by 	the Governor that the way is open for my visit. The question now is 	when I should go. I cannot go before October under any circumstances 	and as regards October you frighten me. I personally am not 	frightened but if I am not to go in October it will be very late.     (i) 	The Government would 	not allow 	the constructive 	workers to make 	any inflammatory 	speeches. (ii) The 	Government would not 	give any opportunity to 	the Constructive 	workers to launch a mass 	movement as 	that of 	1942. (iii) 	The Government would keep a 	close watch on 	the activities of 	the Congress as 	none of 	its members, 	including Gandhiji, 	denounced the violent 	activities of 	Jayaprakash Narayan. 
 So write to me after considering everything. As you must be aware, I have stayed in Calcutta in October and have moved about. Besides, I ask myself why I cannot stay in a place where you all can. I will advise you to see Satis Babu also in this connection. I know it is a tricky matter, but we should be able to do something.
 In Calcutta I shall stay in Sodepur. I know Sarat Babulibtech_626_footnotelibtech_627_footnotewould insist that I should stay with him. You should jointly decide and let me know. I am not going there for a fixed period. I want to lose myself in the misery of Bengal. I want to go to Midnapore and also to Chittagong. I do not know how far the body will carry. Also I shall not be able to put up with undisciplined crowds and constant noise.
 Do not go on saying ‘yes’ to everybody. Meet the persons whom you have to meet and let me know. Meet Sudhir Ghosh also. I have come to know him quite well and he has something to do with my going there. He works with the Tatas.

 DEAR TENDULKAR,
 Many are protesting to me that I am officiating at your marriage tomorrow. Among them are Manilal and now his wife. She tells me that this will be your third marriage, though I believe in one man one wife and vice versa for all time. I know about your new German wife but nothing about your previous wife. My son says none of my ideals will be realized in this union and that neither you nor Indu will carry out my wish that you may not procreate during the country’s dependence. I have told them that I cannot go back on my promise which is not in itself immoral or not for a manifestly immoralpurpose. Therefore the promise shall be fulfilled (D. V.,). But you will please give me such answer as you can.
Now for your preparation for tomorrow:
  Both 	should fast 	till the marriage tie 	is formed, 	fruits may be 	taken.  You 	will both read 12th 	Chapter of 	Gita and 	contemplate its 	meaning. Each 	will clean up separate 	plots of ground 	with measure. Each 	will tend cows in the Goshala. Each 	will clean up the well side. Each 	will clean a closet well.  Each 	will spin daily and 	do all 	these with 	the intention so 	far as 	possible of 	carrying out 	these yajnas daily.

636,,YARN DONATION,"
         	We all know that Shri Narandas Gandhi is a dedicated votary of 	khadi. He has such great faith in khadi that he sees Daridranarayana 	in it. He therefore spins for many hours a day. He has also 	given a prominent place to spinning in the national school conducted 	by him at Rajkot. For the last many years he has been collecting 	both yarn and money for the “Charkha Dwadashi’’libtech_631_footnote. This time he has carried    
 the sutra yajna a long way and he has expressed his wish to the country that not only spinning but donating of yarn should catch on. Everyone can participate in it. It should be borne in mind that he does not insist that the yarn should be donated to him only. It can be given to All-India Spinners’ Association as well. What he wants is  that people should now give yarn donations freely and that he should be supplied with figures as to the quantity of yarn spun all over India and the quantity of yarn donated. To provide information to the public it is enough if these figures are sent to the All-India Spinners’ Asso- ciation office. However, the activity will gain impetus if figures are sent to the person who has conceived the idea, has struggled for it and has fostered the activity. If the figures are sent to him, he will have a clear picture of the work done and his planning and knowledge will prove very useful to all for further progress of work.
 Every year he seeks my consent for whatever work he does. This year I thought it proper to accept only yarn donations and suggested it to him accordingly. I have visualized yarn currency and have called Chi. Narandas its banker. I believe that he has the right ability and purity for that kind of work. It is possible that at present the yarn will not fulfil all the requirements of the currency. But our aim today is to increase the number of spinners from the standpoint of non-violent swaraj.
 An experiment to make yarn a currency was made locally at Nalwadi. Another experiment is going on in Bezwada. However the ideas behind the two experiments were different. The experiment can be extended to cover the whole of India. Only one year will  be required for such currency to come into force. Every home will then become a mint. But it is only an idea today. For the time being all the spinners will produce currency in the form of yarn and will give that away in donation. Every branch of the All-India Spinners’ Associa- tion will collect such donations. The yarn will belong to the All-India Spinners’ Association. Only the account will be sent to Chi. Narandas. The ownership will be that of the All-India Spinners’ Association. Narandas will be the custodian of the yarn sent to him directly or collected by himself. It will be utilized and distributed with my permi- ssion. The money and the yarn collected by Chi. Narandas every year is distributed with my permission. It will be the same this year also.
 This year the idea of cash collection has been given up. However, cash will be received from those who want to give it but the
 All-India Spinner’s Association will not make any arrangement for its collection. The same rule applies to Chi. Narandas. The aim will be to collect only yarn donations.
 Whatever yarn the All-India Spinners’ Association collects will be its capital. From now on it will not collect cash for carrying on its activities but will manage with yarn only.
 The yarn thus collected will not be sold. But the khadi made from it will be sold. Yarn will be taken but not given. Only the things made from it will be given and sold.
 The rule already exists of taking a certain amount of yarn when selling khadi but at some places the practice has been started of giving khadi in exchange for the full quantity of yarn. In spite of that the effort will be to have only yarn donations on the occasion ofCharkha Jayanti. However, I want that besides khadi other articles of village industries should be made available in exchange for yarn. But that can be realized only when we take the final step. At the moment I have presented the idea of yarn currency only in its initial form. It is easy for accounting and the capital of yarn increases not by interest but by the labour of the spinner. If the people understand this scheme then yarn will become an instrument for the production of goods worth crores of rupees. Physical labour will become the capital and will easily be able to compete with capitalists.

SEVAGRAM,
    CHI. 	VINOBA,  August 	18, 1945 
  	. . . I shall look into the Nayee Talim matter. Ashadevi is not here 	at present.  	I have not a full copy of the Ramayana as abridged by me but 	I send you a marked copy of the Ramayana from which you will 	be able to know the principles on which I had worked. As far as 	possible I have tried to retain the historical or narrative portion 	unbroken. Some of the interpolations are useful by themselves, but 	still I have dropped them altogether. I have also dropped any matter 	which had been over-lengthened as also such portions as appeared to 	me unnecessary for the narrative. I have also generally removed 	portions where woman is referred to in derogatory terms. But I have 	kept some portions of it just to indicate the mind of Tulsidas. So 	far as I can remember at the moment, these are the principles I 	worked upon. But you are intelligent enough to discover any other 	principle not mentioned here from the marks in the book.  	Failure has compelled me to do what I was not prepared to do by 	persuasion. I mean that I have commenced from yesterday 	therecitation of  Gitailibtech_633_footnotelibtech_634_footnotein 	place of the Sanskrit  Gita.  I   realized  that 	nobody learnt Sanskrit. The same old members are there, but even 	they do not or are unable to study Sanskrit even to the extent of 	understanding the Gita. Moreover, they were unable to recite 	it in chorus, and what pained me more was the fact that though the  	recitation of the whole of the Gita was confined to  the  	morning prayer, still some members walked out as soon as the 	recitation began. On making an enquiry into the cause of this, I 	found that it was very trivial. I did not know it before. I found it 	out only the day before yesterday, and I immediately came to the 	conclusion that perhaps interest in the Gita might be created 	more quickly if it was recited in Hindi, Marathi or Gujarati since 	the people would understand its     
 meaning more easily. I have commenced with Gitai because Marathi holds the place of prominence in this part. So far as the members attending the morning prayer are concerned, they are so few that it would not matter much which language I chose. But the music of Gitai has been felt by me to be very sweet. Maybe, the reason for this is that I have heard it several times recited by Shivajilibtech_635_footnotelibtech_636_footnoteand I have liked it. Kishorelal’s (Gujarati) translation is there but I have not yet been able to assimilate its music. I have not heard anyone reciting it in a sweet tone. I got an opportunity of hearing it at Bardoli but it was insufficient, and my ear could not adapt itself to it.  Haribhaulibtech_637_footnotelibtech_638_footnotehas published the Hindi Gita recently. But I have not yet been able even to examine it and so did not like to touch it. Therefore, I have commenced with Gitai.
 The immediate cause for writing this is that I happened to see Shivaji yesterday. If he is going to stay here for some time, it would please me if he can be induced to give at least a week to the Ashram just now during the period of the commencement of this recitation. He can train those who desire in reciting it in the same manner as he does, and pick up his music.

  Kanchan 	does desire 	sexual pleasure. You 	also have the desire. It 	would not 	be anything 	strange if you 	lived together 	and satisfied 	your desire. 	Self-suppression is not 	going to help. 	Hence do what 	you feel 	is natural 	for you. 	Thwarting Kanchan’s 	desire will 	harm her. She is 	good and has the spirit 	of service. 	She will lose both 	these things in 	the end. Let 	Hiramani go 	on as she is doing 	till Ashadevi arrives.  Read 	Parnerkar’s letter 	and have 	a talk 	with him. About the 	farm, too, do 	what is 	necessary. Take 	Kishorelal’s help.  About 	Krishnachandra you 	will have to think. 	Talk with him 	frankly and 	with love regarding his 	habit of 	eating and 	about other 	matters, too. You 	should think about your 	temperamental differences.  Let 	the yarn spun by 	me be handed over to 	the Ashram. 	Get that much quantity 	spun by 	me when I arrive there. 	If the  other 	people spin from the 	Ashram cotton, the 	yarn should be 	credited to 	the Ashram. 	What we spin 	is of course 	for the Ashram.  Whenever 	you wish 	to ask me anything 	about the women, 	you may 	do so.  You 	will be 	able to 	improve your 	singing with 	effort. If 	you have no time for that, you need not join in the singing at all. Run 	classes for 	the Gitai and 	nothing else.  About 	the expenses 	here, it 	is all right 	that you have 	bought the ticket. I will not be able to judge better in this matter.  Sankaranji 	may, if 	he wishes, 	cook his 	own meals if he cannot 	keep good health otherwise. Ramachandran 	is there 	only for a 	short period.

646,"August 20, 1945",HOW TO DO IT?,"
    
 The A. I. V. I. A. has not shown the results it might have. I have often asked myself that question. I try now and here to think aloud and confer with the workers to see what can be done.
 We lazily copy the Congress and set up committees and think that we shall thereby popularize and advance the craft of the villages.
 We forget that the Congress, being a democratic body, must work democratically and through committees set up by the people from [among] themselves. On the other hand, the A.I.V.I.A. and like bodies are self-formed to work out particular purposes often requiring high technical skill. They collect money from those who appreciate the particular purpose and become trustees for the money to be used therefor. We collect and study the literature on the subject. We look about for and employ experts and if there are none become experts ourselves. The work will make progress in exact proportion to our knowledge, earnestness and industry. The work itself may  be unpopular or unknown. We have then to make it popular or known. Such associations all over the world must work whether in countries democratically or autocratically governed. In either case they must work under patronage or in the teeth of opposition. The system of work will be identical under either autocracy or democracy. With us the A. I. S. A., the A. I. V. I. A., the Hindustani Talimi Sangh, etc., though autonomous, are creations of the Congress and, therefore requiring enthusiastic support of all Congressmen and, to the extent that Congressmen represent all India, of Indians throughout the land. But before this can happen we must dot India with experts of the type wanted. Therefore, the first thing is to have a central body of honest experts. There is no other royal road to success. Committees or even agents can show no results unless they are experts who know their
 
 work. Can an M.A., however brilliant he may be, introduce, say, the charkha among the villagers, or gur-making from palm trees or manure-making from village refuse including human excreta and cattle dung? We must have experts in these and such other branches. If we had our own government, however inefficient, we would have technical institutes where every one of the useful activities now going on or which were going on even yesterday in the 7,00,000 villages could be studied. Unfortunately, we have not. Hence our associations have also to be such institutes in addition to becoming propagandists. But before we can become the latter, we have to become the former. If I have drawn a correct picture, let us mend even though the mending may be difficult and even hurtful to our pride.

647,"August 20, 1945",FOREWORD TO “THE ECONOMY OF PERMANENCE”,"
    
 Like his brochure on the Practice and Precepts of Jesus, Dr. Kumarappa’s on The Economy of Permanence is a jail production. It is not as easy to understand as the first. It needs careful reading twice or thrice if it is to be fully appreciated. When I took up the manuscript  I was curious to know what it could contain. The opening chapter satisfied my curiosity and led me on to the end without fatigue and yet with profit. This doctor of our village industries shows that only through them we shall arrive at the economy of permanence in the place of that of the fleeting nature we see around us at present. He tackles the question—shall the body triumph over and stifle the soul or shall the latter triumph over and express itself through a perishable body which, with its few wants healthily satisfied, will be free to subserve the end of the imperishable soul? This is “Plain living and high thinking”.

 CHI. PARNERKAR,
 I believe that you understand Gujarati and can read it with ease. Let me know if it is not so. Have this read out to you. Do something about the wolf. The manure heap should go. The Goshala should become an ideal goshala. Keep the place perfectly clean. Our water should be drinkable. Mosquitoes and flies should easily go. The roads should be in good condition. The hill is in our possession. Those who go for walks there should bring stones from there. Do you know that in this way I had made a mountain of stones in the Mahila Ashram? All of it came in useful there.

 It was really good that I did not bring you along or you did not come. It was drizzling when we arrived here. It is cold and also humid here. The weather is cloudy. The place is crowded too. Sardar has of course taken rooms for you in the mill area nearly. But of what use are they? I will write to you if the weather becomes dry. Do not worry about my work. Sushila, Manilal, Narayan and others help me. They will to some extent make up for your absence.

 I have gone through the English part of what you have sent. Why did you have to write in English? Hindustani would have been sufficient. The English needs improvement. You must leave that to others. I shall try to read the Hindustani also. I shall read the scheme of Goseva Sangh also before getting it published. Show it to Parnerkar and Satis Babu and, if possible, to a veterinarian. I had a few pages read out to me by Sushilabehn. She has pointed out some technical mistakes. The treatment of the subject matter is good. You have said in brief all that you could say. If I want to return it shall I send it to Ahmedabad? I understand that you have not kept a copy.
 You suggest boycotting the buffalo. This you will not have got from my writings. My view is that our preference should be for the Cow.Doing this will save both. At present there is shortage of milk, so We need both. Preferring the cow saves both, preferring the buffalo destroys both.
I hope all of you are well.

Still I will call you when it completely stops raining here and that 	too in the hope that the change of air will do good to both of you. 	I do not want to take work from you here. Valji comes daily. His 	competent son is also prepared to render some service but I have not 	entrusted him with any work. There is no work which can be given to 	him. I 	understand about Parnerkar.  	You have done what you could. It seems that your recom- mendations 	cannot be implemented now. Everyone has land and a house, how can 	they be removed? Moreover, can those who are true workers stay at a 	distance? Why should they be  servants?  It  is  a matter of shame 	and sorrow that they are retained as servants. Thenumber of those 	who are retained as servants will not be reduced by their staying in 	different places. Only the attitude of everyone should be changed. 	If that happens the question of staying separately or in different 	places should not arise. Yes, one thing is certain. It will 
 be a long time before people’s nature changes. In the mean time there will be a scramble for servants and that will do good to no one. However, if I have understood your recommendations they may be applied in future but not to the organizations which are functioning today. There was and is a purpose in merging all the organizations, although whatever has happened was only a drifting of the current. Do let me know if there is a flaw in the argument. If the present situation cannot be changed I want to understand the whole position.
I hope both of you are keeping good health.

 In spite of my disinclination to answer the question like the one put to me by Mr. Emanuel Celler, I feel that I shall be wanting in courtesy, if I do not meet Mr. Celler’s wishes. The best way for America to assist India’s struggle for independence is to study the question, so as not to be misled by the untruth that is being spread by British Agency at a great cost about India. Americans have to get out of the way of her struggle. For the rest, India has to fight her own battle of independence which she is trying to secure by a non-violent technique.

 I do not think that your letter is long. The subject  matter required that much.
 What can be done if you can’t sit together and make up your minds? What will you do if I die? Will you all be separated from each other? The Goshala, the Talimi Sangh, the Charkha Sangh and the Ashram are together because they were all conceived by one man— other two exist separately merely by chance. They could both havebeen located at one place. As far as the site is concerned the Ashram and the Goshala should coexist. This has to be thought over. I have liked your letter and so sent it to the Ashram. Do think over the matter if you can. But if it is not possible leave it. It can’t be solved by devoting more time to it. We must know the subject is beyond our ken if we have to devote too much time to it. We have first  hand experience of this in arithmetic.

LETTER FROM JAIRAMDAS DAULATRAM TO ANAND T. HINGORANIlibtech_686_footnote
 PANCHGANI,
 June 10, 1945
 DEAR BROTHER,
 You must have received my letter sent from here. Your letter of the 3rd June addressed to Bapu was received by him today. There is a great pressure of work on him, so he has asked me to reply to it.
 Bapu said that he had also received your earlier letter, but owing to rush of work he could not send a reply. After coming here I am better able to realize what a tremendous burden of work rests on him and how he can deal with it only bit by bit on account of his reduced capacity. There is no quick disposal of work as before. Besides, the present happenings in the country also take up much of his time.
 About the “Daily Thoughts”, Bapu inquired whether they would be published in Hindi only or there would also be English rendering simultaneously.If there is to be an English translation, then he will like to see it himself and this task he will not be able to shoulder at present. I do not exactly remember what we had decided about the English translation. So please write to me by return of post. If it is only the Hindi edition, then there will be no difficulty in Bapu’s writing a preface to it. Perhaps it would be easier for him to find time for it.
 As regards the questions you had sent to Bapu in respect of your book “To the Statesmen of the World”, Bapu says that he would have gladly answered them, but that  at the present moment his mind is not disposed to undertake that burden either. You will, therefore, have to do without his answer to your questions.
 I had spoken to Bapu regarding the Navajivan and the “Gandhi Series”. He advised me that since Naraharibhai was here, I should personally hear what he has to say. I had, therefore, a brief talk with him last evening and will have further  discussion with him again today. Then we shall see where the matter stands.
 Have you got enough supply of paper for bringing out your new book “To the Statesmen”? I learn that the Government is increasing the paper quota. How far is it
 
 true? Do write all the news about yourself. How about Hassa?
 I am enclosing herewith a few lines from Bapu. Many loves.
 
 
 
 
Yours,
 JAIRAM
 
  From 	a microfilm of the Sindhi: Courtesy: National Archives of India and 	Anand T. Hingorani    APPENDIX II  SPEECH 	BROADCAST BY THE VICEROYlibtech_687_footnote  June 14, 1945  I 	have been authorized by His Majesty’s Government to place before 	Indian political leaders proposals designed to ease the present 	political situation and to advance India towards her goal of full 	self-government. These proposals are at the present moment being 	explained to Parliament by the Secretary of State for India. My 	intention in this broadcast is to explain to you the proposals, the 	ideas underlying them, and the method by which I hope to put them 	into effect.  This 	is not an attempt to obtain or impose a constitutional settlement. 	His Majesty’s Government had hoped that the leaders of the Indian 	parties would agree amongst themselves on a settlement of the 	communal issue, which is the main stumbling-block; but this hope has 	not been fulfilled.  In 	the mean time, India has great opportunities to be taken and great 	problems to be solved, which require a common effort by the leading 	men of all parties. I, therefore, propose, with the full support of 	His Majesty’s Government, to invite Indian leaders, both of 	Central and Provincial politics, to take counsel with me with a view 	to the formation of a new Executive Council more representative of 	organized political opinion. The proposed new Council would 	represent the main communities and would include equal proportions 	of caste Hindus and Muslims. It would work, if formed, under the 	existing Constitution. But it would be an entirely Indian Council, 	except for the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, who would retain 	his position as War Member. It is also proposed that the portfolio 	of External Affairs, which has hitherto been held by the Viceroy, 	should be placed in charge of an Indian Member of Council, so far as 	the interests of British India are concerned.  A 	further step proposed by His Majesty’s Government is the 	appointment of a    
 British High Commissioner in India, as in the Dominions, to  represent  Great  Britains’ commercial and other such interests in India.
 Such a new Executive Council will, you realize, represent a definite advance on the road to self-government. It will be almost entirely Indian, and the Finance and Home Members will for the first time be Indians, while an Indian will also be charged with the management of India’s Foreign Affairs. Moreover, Members will now be selected by the Governor-General after consultations with political leaders; though their appointment will of course be subject to the approval of His Majesty the King-Emperor.
 The council will work within the framework of the present constitution and there can be no question of the Governor-General agreeing not to exercise his constitutional power of control; but it will of course not be exercised unreasonably.
 I should make it clear that the formation of this interim Government will in no way prejudice the final constitutional settlement.
 The main task for this new Executive Council would be:
 First, to prosecute the war against Japan with the utmost energy till Japan is utterly defeated.
 Secondly, to carry on the Government of British India, with all the manifold tasks of post-war development in front of it, until a new permanent constitution can be agreed upon and come into force.
 Thirdly, to consider, when the Members of the Government think it possible, the means by which such agreement can be achieved. The third  task is  most important. I want to make it quite clear that neither I nor His Majesty’s Government have lost sight of the need for a long-term solution, and that the present proposals are intended to make a long-term solution easier.
 I have considered the best means of forming such a Council; and have decided to invite the following to Viceregal Lodge to advise me:
 Those now holding office as Premier in a Provincial Government; or, for provinces now under Section 93 Government, those who last held the office of the Premier.
 The Leader of the Congress Party and the Deputy Leader of the Muslim League in the Central Assembly; the leader of the Congress Party and the Muslim League in the Council of State; also the leader of the Nationalist Party and the European Group in the Assembly.
 Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah as the recognized leaders of the two main political parties.
 Rao Bahadur N. Siva Raj to represent the Scheduled Classes. Master Tara Singh to represent the Sikhs.
 Invitations to these gentlemen are being handed to them today and it is proposed to assemble the conference on 25th June at Simla where we shall be cooler than at Delhi.
 I trust that all those invited will attend the conference and give me their help. On me and on them will lie a heavy responsibility in this fresh attempt to make progress towards a final settlement of India’s future.
 If the meeting is successful, I hope that we shall be able to agree on the formation of the new Executive Council at the Centre. I also hope that it will be possible for Ministries to re-assume office and again undertake the tasks of Government in the provinces now administered under Section 93 of the Constitution Act and that these Ministries will be coalitions.
 If the meeting should unfortunately fail, we must carry on as at present until the parties are ready to come together. The existing Executive Council, which has done such valuable work for India will continue it if other arrangements cannot be agreed.
 But I have every hope that the meeting will succeed, if the party leaders will approach the problem with the sincere intention of working with me and with each other. I can assure them that there is behind this proposal a most genuine desire on the part of all responsible leaders in the United Kingdom and of the British people as  a whole to help India towards her goal. I believe that this is more than a step towards that goal, it is a considerable stride forward, and a stride on the right path.
 I  should  make  it  clear  that these proposals   affect   British   India   only and do not make any alteration in the relations of the Princes with the Crown Representative.
 With the approval of His Majesty’s Government, and after consultation with my Council, orders have been given for the immediate release of the members of the Working Committee of Congress who are still in detention. I propose to leave the final decision about the others still under detention as the result of the 1942 disturbances to the new Central Government, if formed, and to the Provincial governments.
 The appropriate time for fresh elections for the Central and Provincial legislatures will be discussed at the conference.
 Finally, I would ask you all to help in creating the atmosphere of goodwill and mutual confidence that is essential if we are to make progress. The destiny of this great country and of the many millions who live in it depends on the wisdom and good understanding of the leaders, both of action and of thought, British and Indian,  at this critical moment of India’s history.
 India’s military reputation never stood higher in the world than it does at present; thanks to the exploits of her sons drawn from all parts of the country. Her representatives at international conference have won high regard for their
 statesmanlike attitude. Sympathy for India’s aspirations and progress towards prosperity was never greater or more widespread. We have thus great assets if we can use them wisely. But it will not be easy, it will not be quick; there is very much to do, there are many pitfalls and dangers. There is on all sides something to forgive and forget.
 I believe in the future of India, and as far as in me lies will further her greatness. I ask you all for your co-operation and goodwill.

 TELEGRAM FROM LORD WAVELLlibtech_688_footnote
 Immediate	NEW DELHI,
 June 16, 1945
 M. K. GANDHI ESQ. PANCHGANI
 Many thanks for your telegram of  15th  June.  I  have  also  seen  your statement  in  today’s  newspapers.  As  regards   your   attendance  at   the   conference I  will  await  your  letter  referred  to  in  your   telegram   of   16th   June   which   I have just received. I assure you, term “caste Hindus” was not used with offensiveintention. Meaning is that there should be equality between Muslims and Hindus other than members of scheduled castes. Subject to this, exact composition of council would of course have to be decided after discussion at conference. On question  of independence I invite your attention to Secretary of State’s speech in Parliament on 14th June as published in Indian Press. Following is the relevant passage:
 The offer of March 1942 stands in its entirety. That offer is based on two main principles. First, no limit is set to India’s freedom to decide her own destiny whether as a free partner in the Commonwealth or even without it. Second, that this can only be achieved under a constitution or constitutions framed by Indians to which the main elements are consenting parties.
 It would not be practicable to modify the terms of my broadcast. It is only a simple statement of the proposals approved by His Majesty’s Government and my intention is to deal at the conference itself with any points requiring clarification. I do not think it advisable to enter into detailed discussions before the conference which I hope, as you do yourself, will be held in a friendly atmosphere and without party bitterness. As you suggest I am releasing our telegrams to the Press.

DESAI-LIAQAT PACTlibtech_689_footnote
 The Congress and the League agree that they will join in forming an interim government in the Centre. The composition of such Government will be on the following lines:
  An 	equal number of persons nominated by the Congress and the League in 	the Central 	Executive (the persons 	nominated need not 	be members 	of the 	Central Legislature),  representatives 	of minorities 	(in particular 	the Scheduled 	Castes and the 	Sikhs), the Commander-in-Chief. 
 The Government will be formed and will function within the framework of the existing Government of India Act. It is, however, understood that, if the Cabinet cannot get a particular measure passed by the Legislative Assembly, they will not enforce the same by resort to any of the reserve powers of the Governor-General or the Viceroy. This will make them sufficiently independent of the Governor-General.
 It is agreed between the Congress and the League that, if such interim government is formed, their first step would be to release the Working Committee members of the Congress.
 The steps by which efforts would be made to achieve this end are at present indicated to take the following course:
 On the basis of the above understanding some way should he found to get the Governor-General to make a proposal or a suggestion that he desires an interim Government to be formed in the Centre on the agreement between the Congress and the League and when the Governor-General invites Mr. Jinnah and Mr. Desai either jointly or separately, the above proposal would be made declaring that they are prepared to join in forming the government.
 The next step would be to get the withdrawal of Section 93 in the Provinces and to form as soon as possible Provincial Governments on the lines of a coalition.

 APPENDIX VI
 STATEMENT MADE IN PARLIAMENT BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIAlibtech_691_footnote
June 14, 1945
 During the recent visit of Field-Marshal Viscount Wavell to this country, His Majesty’s Government reviewed with him a number of problems and discussed particularly the present political situation in India.
 Members will be aware that since the offer by His Majesty’s Government to India of March 1942, there has been no further progress towards the solution of the Indian constitutional problem.
 As was then stated, the working out of India’s new constitutional system is a task which can only be carried through by the Indian people themselves.
 While His Majesty’s Government are at all times most anxious to do their utmost to assist the Indians in the working out of a new constitutional settlement, it would be a contradiction in terms to speak of the imposition by this country of self-governing institutions upon an unwilling India. Such a thing is not possible, nor could we accept the responsibility for enforcing such institutions at the very time when we were, by its purpose, withdrawing from all control of British Indian affairs.
 The main constitutional position remains therefore as it was. The offer of March 1942 stands in its entirety without change or qualification. His Majesty’s Government still hope that the political leaders in India may be able to come to an agreement as to the procedure whereby India’s permanent future form of government can be determined.
 His Majesty’s Government are, however, most anxious to make any contribution that is practicable to the breaking of the political deadlock in India. While that deadlock lasts not only political but social and economic progress is being hampered.
 The Indian administration, over-burdened with the great tasks laid upon it by the war against Japan and by the planning for the post-war period, is further strained by the political tension that exists.
 All that  is  so  urgently  required  to  be  done  for  agricultural  development  and for the peasants and workers of India cannot be carried through unless whole-hearted co-operation of every community and section of the Indian people is forthcoming.
 His Majesty’s Government have therefore considered whether there is
 
 
 something which they could suggest in this interim period, under the existing constitution, pending the formulation by Indians of their future constitutional arrangements which would enable the main communities and parties to co-operate more closely together and with the British to the benefit of the people of India as a whole.
 It is not the intention of His Majesty’s Government to introduce any change contrary to the wishes of the major Indian communities. But they are willing to make possible some steps forward during the interim period if the leaders of the principal Indian parties are prepared to agree to their suggestion and to co-operate in the successful conclusion of the war against Japan as well as in the reconstruction in India which must follow the final victory.
 To this end they would be prepared to see an important change in the composition of the Viceroy’s Executive. This is possible without making any change in the existing statute law except for one amendment to the Ninth Schedule to the Act of 1935. That Schedule contains a provision that not less than three members of the Executive must have had at least 10 years’ service under the Crown in India. If the proposals I am about to lay before the House meet with acceptance in India, that clause would have to be amended to dispense with that requirement.
 It is proposed that the Executive Council should be reconstituted and that the Viceroy should in future make his selection to the Crown for appointment to his Executive from amongst leaders of Indian political life at the Centre and in the Provinces, in proportions which would give a balanced representation of the main communities, including equal proportions of Muslims and caste Hindus.
 In order to pursue this object,  the  Viceroy  will  call  into  conference  a  number of leading Indian politicians who are the heads of the most important parties or who have had recent experience as Prime Ministers of Provinces, together with a few others of special experience and authority. The Viceroy intends to put before this conference the proposal that the Executive Council should be reconstituted as above stated and to invite from the members of the conference a list of names. Out of these he would hope to be able to choose the future members whom he would recommend for appointment by his Majesty to the Viceroy’s council, although the responsibility for the recommendations must of course continue to rest with him, and his freedom of choice therefore remains unrestricted.
 The members of his Council who are chosen as a result of this arrangement would of course accept the position on the basis that they would whole-heartedly co-operate in supporting and carrying through the war against Japan to its victorious conclusion.
 The  members  of  the  Executive  would  be  Indians  with  the   exception   of the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, who would retain his position as War
 Member. This is essential so long as the defence of India remains a British responsibility.
 Nothing contained in any of these proposals will affect the relations of the Crown with the Indian States through the Viceroy as Crown Representative.
 The Viceroy has been authorized by His Majesty’s Government to place this proposal before the Indian leaders. His Majesty’s Government trust that the leaders of the Indian communities will respond. For the success of such a plan must depend on its acceptance in India and the degree to which responsible Indian politicians are prepared to co-operate with the object of making it a workable interim arrange-ment. In the absence of such general acceptance existing arrangements must neces-sarily continue.
 If such co-operation can be achieved at the Centre it will no doubt be reflected in the provinces and so enable responsible governments to be set up once again in those provinces where, owing to the withdrawal of the majority party from participation, it became necessary to put into force the powers of the Governors under Section 93 of the Act of 1935. It is to be hoped that in all the Provinces these governments would be based on the participation of the main parties, thus smoothing out communal differences and allowing Ministers to concentrate upon their very heavy administrative tasks.
 There is one further change which, if these proposals are accepted, His Majesty’s Government suggest should follow.
 That is, that External Affairs (other than those tribal and frontier matters which fall to be dealt with as part of the defence of India) should be placed in the charge of an Indian Member of the Viceroy’s Executive so far as British India is concerned, and that fully accredited representatives shall be appointed for the representation of India abroad.
 By their acceptance of and co-operation in this scheme the Indian leaders will not only be able to make their immediate contribution to the direction of Indian affairs, but it is also to be hoped that their experience of co-operation in government will expedite agreement between them as to the method of working out the new constitutional arrangements.
 His Majesty’s Government consider, after the most careful study of the question, that the plan now suggested gives the utmost progress practicable within the present constitution. None of the changes suggested will in any way prejudice or prejudge the essential form of the future permanent constitution or constitutions for India.
 His Majesty’s Government feel certain that given goodwill and a genuine desire to co-operate on all sides, both British and Indian, these proposals can mark a
 genuine step forward in the collaboration of the British and Indian peoples towards Indian self-government and can assert the rightful position, and strengthen the influence, of India in the counsels of the nations.

 APPENDIX VII
 LORD WAVELL’S NOTE ON HIS INTERVIEWlibtech_692_footnote
 June 24, 1945
 I began by making a short statement on the objects of the proposals of H. M. G., the spirit in which they were conceived and the spirit in which I hoped they would be accepted and worked. I emphasized the necessity for full support of the war, and that it was essential that the political parties should put in their very best men, determined to concentrate on the economic and other problems of India, and not merely to enter the Government in a party spirit.
 Mr. Gandhi then made a long, tortuous and prolix statement, which dealt with the history of the Congress, British rule in India, British character, the qualities of a good soldier, and many other more or less relevant subjects. It lasted over half an hour, and ended with a sort of general blessing on the proposals, which he said he had recommended to the Working Committee.
 He then went on, referring to some notes, to deal with certain other points. I think this was a list prepared for him as a result of the discussions by Congress Working Committee. The main points were as follows:
  That 	it would 	have been much better 	if I 	had ordered 	the release 	of all 	the political 	prisoners and not merely 	the Working 	Committee.  That 	the term ‘Caste Hindus’ 	should not have been 	used, as 	his great 	aim was 	that there should be no question of caste inside Congress; he would 	have preferred the term ‘Non-Scheduled Hindus’.  He 	then went on 	to the question 	of coalitions 	in Provinces, 	obviously with the 	idea of trying 	to establish 	that the minorities 	should be represented 	by members 	of their 	body belonging 	to Congress.  He 	referred to 	the matter 	of parity, 	and said 	he had 	been under very severe 	pressure as 	regards this, 	but that 	he was 	prepared to 	accept it. 	He indicated 	that it 	would be 	open to 	Congress to 	put forward the 	names of 	Muslims or 	Scheduled Castes, 	and I agreed 	but said that the 	principle of 	parity between 	non-Scheduled Hindus and 	Muslims must be maintained. He then digressed into a long story about members of the Indian Army who 
 
 had wished to see him but had been compelled, like Nicodemus, to come to him by night and in mufti. I said that the one thing which was disastrous for any government was if the army became political; that the Indian Army had a Commander-in-Chief in whom they had full trust; that their reputation never stood higher and that I could assure him that the Indian Army was on the whole a thoroughly contented body. He agreed to all these statements.
  He 	then started 	on the question of the 	Indian States. I 	said that the 	conference dealt entirely 	with British 	India, and that I 	was not prepared 	at this 	stage to 	enter into a 	discussion of 	the Indian States. He 	agreed that it 	had nothing to 	do with the conference and was not appropriate for discussion at the moment. 
 I asked Mr. Gandhi at the end, whether he proposed to attend the conference in person. He said that he represented nobody except himself, and that though he would be prepared to attend the conference if I wished, and sit in a corner, he strongly advised me that his presence at the conference was undesirable. He said that he would hold himself at my disposal for as long as I wished, but that if I had nothing on which    I had to consult him he would propose to leave Simla tomorrow. I said that I would let him know.
 The interview was mainly a discursive monologue by Mr. Gandhi, interspersed by numerous digressions, such as a most graphic description of the death of his Private Secretary and the relation of his carrying down the wounded General Woodgate from Spion Kop in 1899. My general impression of him was that he was friendly for the time being, but perfectly prepared to go back at any time on anything he had said.

 APPENDIX VIII
 ABUL KALAM AZAD’S LETTER TO LORD WAVELLlibtech_693_footnote
 ARMSDELL, SIMLA,
 July 15, 1945
 DEAR LORD WAVELL,
 After announcing the failure of the Conference, you were good enough to ask for the support of all parties in ensuring a calm atmosphere. I do not propose to reiterate the Congress view about the failure. I expressed it sufficiently at the Conference. But in fairness to you and to ourselves I must point out that co-operation inevitably depends on the removal of obstacles to it. Some of these obstacles are of a psychological nature with roots in the past relations between India and England. These can only gradually disappear with a change in those relations. But there are others of a more tangible kind which serve as constant irritants to our people and which affect our day-to-day activity. They are continually before us. In spite of this preoccupation, however, we did not think it desirable to raise this matter, except perhaps rather vaguely in the course of conversations with you, as we were anxious not to place any difficulties in your path when you were dealing with a delicate situation.
   But 		now that one 		chapter has 		ended and 		our minds, as 		well as 		yours, are 		turned to 		future possibilities of 		finding a 		way out, honourable 		to all 		concerned and 		leading to 		the objective 		of Indian 		freedom, these obstacles to 		co-operation cannot be 		ignored. I 		am taking 		the liberty, 		therefore, of pointing 		them out 		to you 		in the 		hope that 		you will 		have early steps taken to have them removed. The steps that I consider necessary and earnestly urge upon you are:  
  The 	bans on 	all Congress 	and allied 	organizations should 	be removed 	at once. 	It has 	not been possible to 	convene the 	A. I. C. C. because 	of its 	being an 	illegal organization.  All 	detenus should be 	released without any 	condition being imposed 	upon them, whether 	the detention was 	imposed by 	the Central Government  	or  the 	Provincial Governments.  All 	restrictions on 	the movements 	of released 	detenus or prisoners 	should be removed.  Cases 	of all 	prisoners convicted for 	political or 	like offences 	should be 	examined by a popular judicial tribunal, its verdict should be regarded as final by the 
 
 Government.
  Extra-legal 	restrictions on the 	freedom of 	the Press 	or on the 	movement or 	association of people 	should be removed 	so as to make 	the people feel 	that they are free 	to follow 	normal activities under democratic conditions.  All 	pending sentences of 	hanging arising out 	of the 	disturbances of 	August 1942 	should be commuted 	to life sentences. All 	pending arrests of ‘absconders’ should be cancelled.  All 	prisoners who 	have served full fourteen years should be unconditionally discharged.  What 	has been said above about prisoners 	applies equally, and with 	even greater force, to properties, movable and immovable, and frozen or confiscated. 
   I 		have not endeavoured 		to argue out the justness 		of the foregoing 		requirements as 		I have no 		doubt that you 		will yourself appreciate 		the need 		for action 		along the 		lines indicated. 		If India 		is on the 		eve of having a 		bona-fide national 		representative 		Executive, leading to 		independence after the 		defeat of 		Japan, then 		the necessity 		for this 		approach is self-proved 		and inevitable.  There 		is another 		matter to which 		I should 		like to refer. 		I need 		hardly say on 		behalf of 		the Congress 		that whatever the result 		of your 		promised effort the 		Congress  is 		and has always 		been against the 		Japanese aggression. 		Therefore, there will always 		be on the 		part of 		the Congress 		a desire 		for the defeat 		of Japan 		in her 		designs upon 		China or 		any other 		aggression on 		her part. But 		the thought expressed 		in this paragraph 		will be incomplete 		if I did 		not inform you 		that, in 		the Congress 		estimation, the 		effort now 		being made on 		Indian soil will 		continue to be looked 		upon as a British 		and Allied 		effort, so long 		as there 		is not 		at the 		Centre a 		popular government 		assisted by 		provincial popular governments.  
 Yours sincerely,
 HIS EXCELLENCY VISCOUNT WAVELL VICEREGAL LODGE
