This read: “ . . . some years ago when my discretion had not become sounder and intelligence had not ripened, in an unguarded moment I gave an assurance to a girl of tender age that I would be her husband. I could not foresee then that she would cling to me passionately, my assurance having become an article of faith in her. There might have been no difficulty in our union if she had been     a Brahmin, to which caste I belong, but unfortunately she is a Shudra . . . The idea of a marriage between a Brahmin and a Shudra is revolting to my parents and they much resent it. I am in a fix. I dare not offend my parents who are my makers and to whom I still owe my existence. On the other hand I cannot disown the girl who has considered herself to be my betrothed for years and to discard whom now will probably cause her death. This, I frankly confess, militates against my conscience but I see no way to bridge the difficulty in which I am placed, viz., to marry the girl and at the same time to earn the blessings of the parents. I therefore earnestly appeal to you to take my hapless case into your kind consideration and hold out to me the torch so that I may see a path in the darkness which has enveloped me and is threatening to wipe out the existence of two poor souls” (S.N. 18666)."

There was no mention or sanction of so-called untouchability in the Vedas and other ancient scriptures of the Hindus. The criteria to determine the Chandalas, etc., as prescribed in Manu and other Smritis were in no way applicable to the present so-called ‘untouchables’, and Arya Samaj following in the footsteps of Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati had been propagating the message of equality among all human beings. In accordance with the mission of Maharshi Dayanand, Arya Samaj was doing the work of removal of untouchability for long, and with more vigour after the epic fast. The deputation showed its readiness to help the Guruvayur cause, and thanked Mahatmaji for fulfilling the mission of Swami Dayanand Saraswati.”"

The untouchables have no right to enter the temple on any day. But, as a large crowd admittedly enter the temple on the Krithigai Ekadasi day and as this crowd might possibly include untouchables and as in any case, it is difficult to ascertain the different castes to which the members of the crowd belong, a purificatory ceremony is performed on the next day (Dwadasi). Apart from this, the alleged entry of untouchables on the Ekadasi day is not a fact. They do not enter the-temple at all. For more definite particulars I would refer you to the judgment of Mr. Justice Ramesam Pantulu of the Madras High Court, pronounced in the middle of June last, of which I presume you have a copy.”"
