       March 	10, 1933  DEAR 	FRIEND,  	I have your letter of 22nd ultimo. I do not encourage your advances 	because your letters create no favourable impression on me. They 	seem to be unbalanced and if what you write creates a bad impression 	on me your visit is not likely to improve matters, hence I do not 	like the idea of your wasting your money in travelling here and then 	wasting your time and mine. I assure you that I have not a single 	minute to spare.  Yours 	sincerely,  SJT. 	K. S.

You remind me of slave-owners of old who used to recount their 	services to their slaves in that they gave them food and shelter 	some- what after the style in which they gave both to their cattle, 	only the treatment of the slaves was in many respects worse than 	that of their cattle and in no respect better, and it is quite 	evident to me that you do not even take the trouble of knowing what 	educated and religiously- minded Hindus have done and are doing for 	Harijans whom they do not consider in any shape or form lower than 	themselves but regard them as their own kith and kin.

If you can therefore get the Abolition Bill passed in 	the Mysore Asse-mbly, it would be unnecessary to press for the 	passage of the Temple- entry Bill so far as Mysore is concerned. But 	you will see to it that the interpretation of the Abolition Bill is 	accepted by the sanatanists. If that is achieved the rest may be 	left to the ripening of public opinion.

 March 10, 1933
 DEAR FRIEND,
 I thank you for your interesting letter which I have read care- fully. There is no difficulty about understanding your letter. The prescription that you have suggested is being followed in all the parts of the country. Sanskrit literature has been translated in the vernacu- lars and is accessible to even the illiterate masses.
 As far as the law is concerned, there is no question of compel- ling anybody to regard any other as untouchable. The object of the Bill is to withdraw the sanction of the law to a custom which cannot be defended by any ordinary rule of morality. The law is simply meant to give the reformer the scope of bringing the message to those who will listen to it.

 DEAR SATCOURIBABU,
 I was glad to have your letter and report of the work in January last. Your report was too late for the ensuing issue. Please send everything so as to reach me on Wednesdays at the latest. By all means
 
 send anything you wish to write for the Harijan. I would love to have fresh and suitable ideas.
 In your report I see you say that the Kali Temple was opened. I have heard reports to the contrary, namely, that the Kali Temple was always open to Harijans in a way and that even now it is open only in  a way. You will therefore please enquire about this and let me know. I have had reports from other places also about the opening of temples and then the information was challenged.

 I have another charming letter from you. Your letters are always inside the line. Verrier is quite free from malaria now and his work seems to be steadily going forward. I suppose you know all about his intended marriage with Mary Gillett and their joint decision afterwards not to marry each other but for each to be married to the service to which they have dedicated their lives. It must have been a very bitter cup for them to drink, but they have drunk it courageously. I have not been able quite to follow the latest developments arising out of the Oxford Union resolution on the Pacifism debate.libtech_5_footnote

For, if such a 	resolution were passed, there would be no community which could be 	described as Antyajas.  	We often find contradictory rules being followed in the diffe- rent 	branches of the same institution. Since the prohibition applies to 	residence, I see no moral objection to the admission of Antyajas 	to the school. On the contrary, it would show disregard for 	dharma to deny admission to them.

 March 10, 1933
  	I could read your letter of the 4th only today. Your question is 	good. One who is convinced that there is no other way but 	brahmacharya should know that the right thing for him is to 	strive exclusively to discover the means of perfecting it and should 	continue his experiments to that end in the faith that large numbers 	of people will adopt it one day. He should also be convinced at the 	same time that artificial means of birth-control are dangerous from 	every point of view and are bound to loosen morals. Even if we 	assume that people will have to suffer during the interval before 	brahmacharya comes to be widely accepted, I see nothing wrong 	in that. Like an individual, a society also will reap as it sows. 	But God is merciful. There is mercy even in those of His acts which 	we regard as punishment. When the birth-rate is high, the death-rate 	also will be proportionately high. Mankind, therefore, will live on. 	It is true that such life will not be happy, and it is best that it 	should be so. This knowledge also will persuade people to adopt 	brahmacharya, for even a little experience of it will show 	that, when it has become habitual, it is  a source of much greater 	happiness than indulgence can  give.  In order that the world may go 	on satisfactorily, isn’t it also necessary to obey the other laws 	of God? One such law is that nobody has a right to take more than 	the minimum he needs for his  physical  maintenance. If everyone 	obeyed this law, there would be no starvation even if brahmacharya 	was not observed by large numbers. Physical labour is not 	confined to work in the fields. Every farmer ought to use his hands 	and feet fully, especially the hands.  In  a country where the 	farmers have no subsidiary industry, they become almost like 	animals. If the company of animals is necessary, the experience of 	using tools is equally necessary. If all men cultivated manual 	skill, then even if the population went on increasing, within 	limits, everybody would have enough food to eat, cloth to cover his 	or her body with and protection against heat and cold in a home. 	Remember the meaning of varnadharma which I have been explaining 	these days.  	I think I have answered all your questions, but write to me again if 	I have not.

CHI. NARANDAS,
 I enclose with this letters for Narahari, Moolchand and Champa. I just received your wire about Parachure Shastri. I had been waiting for it before asking him to go there. In reply to a letter which I had written to him, he wrote me a beautiful letter. I am enclosing it. Preserve it there. I have, however, informed him that, if you consent he must go to the Ashram but that he should see his wife, and if she and the children are fit and are willing to stay in the Ashram, all of them should go. I will now let you know what he decides as soon as he informs me. Parachure Shastri also will keep you informed. The final decision will be based wholly on considerations of dharma. All of us, therefore, may rest assured that it will be for our good. I hope you got my previous letters in which I wrote to you about Lakshmi. I wrote one yesterday and one the day before.

 BHAI MOOLCHAND,
Your query has already been answered in Harijan.libtech_9_footnote
 The exercise of the tongue and the pen cannot be regarded physical activity. In this context it means only labour by hands and feet.
 If people do not labour on the land and then starve, what can the brain do? At that time whosoever cultivates even a little will be the saviour. What is the use of a speech when the house is on fire? You will need water to fight the fire, and so on. It does not mean that brain work has no utility. It only means that ideas of those alone will bear fruit who appreciate the significance of manual labour and themselves undertake it. Both types of work should proceed side by side and the best principle is to earn one’s bread from manual labour and to employ the intellect for service only. That will secure a perfect  balance. You may take it that the Ashram was founded with the same objective. You have to grasp this fact if you wish to benefit from a stay in the Ashram.

21,,NOTES,"
       WHAT 	 THEY 	TEACH  	The reader should study the tell-tale figures, collected by the 	Editor and published in another column, of the ‘depressed 	classes’, otherwise called the ‘exterior castes’ of the Madras 	Presidency. They have eighty-six sub-divisions among them. The 	sanatanists  would claim that they are all untouchables by birth!!! 	What were they before they were so classified in the census? It is 	interesting, too, to note that the criterion of untouchability has 	not been the same for all the Provinces, nor the same in every part 	of the same Province, nor is the untouchable of Madras necessarily 	untouchable  in  Bombay  or Bengal. The more one studies these 	figures, the stronger will grow the conviction that this 	untouchability is purely man-made. The census superintendents have 	been the sole judges. The reader will note also that the various 	Governments have differed in their views as to the    
 classification. If the untouchables are God-made, why all these differences? The time is coming when there will be a bid on the part of caste Hindus for being classified as ‘untouchables’. Signs have already begun to appear on the horizon. If untouchables were God- made, we should be able unfailingly to distinguish them without effort from the rest, as we distinguish one species from another.
 And who will answer for these sub-divisions if not caste Hindus? If they will give up untouchability, there is every  hope  of untouchables giving up the sub-untouchability among themselves.
 A GRADUATE’S DIFFICULTY
 A graduate correspondent wants to know why I say that the practice of untouchability is common to all mankind and religions and that it is a necessary institution.
 When we perform natural functions involving uncleanness or have unclean diseases, we are untouchable till we have become clean. The extent of untouchability and the methods of becoming clean no doubt vary among the nations, but the practice of such untouchability, be its extent ever so small, is common to all, including the so-called savage nations. It is a sound hygienic rule when it is intelligently observed. But it was reserved to modern Hinduism to brand a person asuntouchable by birth and call him an offspring of sin. It is a most tragic spectacle that a religion which boasts that ahimsa is the highest thing in life should carry vindictiveness into the other world. It is against this insane untouchability that I have invited all Hindus who are proud of their faith and jealous of its purity to wage relentless war.
 The same correspondent further asks, “Does not your varnadh- arma deprive people of all chances of rise in the social scale? Should not everyone have the permission to follow what  occupation  he likes?”
 According to my conception of varna, all inequality is ruled out of life. Inequality of intellect or in material possessions ought not to mean inequality of social status. I do most emphatically maintain that man is not made to choose his occupation for ‘rising in the social scale’. He is made to serve his fellow-men and earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. And since the primary wants of all are the same, all labour should carry the same value.
 This law Hinduism discovered and called the law of varna, and carried it out in practice more or less perfectly with amazing success. What we see today in Hinduism is its caricature. It is my certain conviction that obedience to that law alone can save the perishing world. Its conscious recognition means contentment and consequent freeing Of human energy for the moral uplift. Its disregard spells
 unhealthy discontent, greed, cut-throat competition and moral stagna- tion ending in spiritual suicide. This law, as I understand it, is not and never has been a mere ceremonial rule regulating the restrictions on eating and marrying.
 WHAT IS SPIRITUAL PROGRESS?
 “When you write about the spirit, the spiritual progress of Harijans, what do you mean? And why is such progress of the world retarded because that of Harijans is? Why is the spiritual progress of Harijans retarded if they are not admitted to temples? “ —asks a persistent correspondent who has many other questions which need not engage us just now.
 Spirit is that moral being which informs the human body and which is imperishable. Spiritual progress is that which promotes the realization of that imperishable essence. What retards the progress of my neighbour must retard mine. India is a big neighbour of other parts of the world. India’s spiritual progress cannot but be retarded if that of forty million Harijans and, therefore, of the two hundred and thirty million Hindus is.
 As to temples, I have discussed elsewherelibtech_10_footnotein this issue what a large part they play in the life of mankind. Spirit itself is capable of intellectual dissection only up to a point. It transcends reason, hence it is a matter of faith. Even so are places of worship matters of faith in the last resort.
 THE BENGALI “HARIJAN”
 Two issues of the Bengali Harijan are already out. It is publis- hed in the form of a magazine with an attractive cover with a Harijan woman carrying a basket of refuse on her head. It is published under the auspices of the Khadi Pratishthan, College Square, Calcutta, and the annual subscription is Rs. 4 including postage, and Rs. 3 without.
 The first and second issues contain either full translations or substance of all the articles that have hitherto appeared in the English edition. It contains also translations of some of my previous writings on Hindu religion and editorials or editorial notes from Satisbabu’s pen, such as, “Result of Neglect”, “Solution of Some Problems of Untouchability”, “The Sanatanists’ Prayer”, “Responsibility of Municipality”, “Depressed Classes and Untouchability”.
 It came out with 2,000 copies the first week, all of which were sold out. It came out with 3,000 the second week. I hope that it will receive generous support from the Bengali public.
 Harijan, 11-3-1933
 
  "
22,,A TRUE SERVANT,"
  
 Experience that is being daily gained shows that the service of Harijans is perhaps the hardest of all services. There are to my know- ledge many girls and grown-up women performing daily personal service. One of them gives a graphic account of her experience in scavengers’ quarters. It was with the greatest difficulty that she could restrain herself from vomiting when she first went to these quarters. I am glad women are taking their due share in the movement.
 How are the Harijans living in hideous filth to be served? They have no will to be served. They curse those who go to their quarters. Some even stone workers out of their streets. Still they must be served, if we will serve ourselves. They must be raised out of this state, if we will raise ourselves. We have pressed them down and in so doing wehave gone down ourselves. Not everyone can perform this high service. Let me sum up the qualities that I have found to be indispen- sable in a Harijan servant:
 He must have true love for Harijans as if they were members of his own family.
 He must have great patience and courage to bear physical injury and insults.
He must have a character above suspicion and reproach.
He must be prepared to live on the barest possible sustenance.
 To go through all my correspondence and to have interviews with Harijans, sanatanists and workers is to pass through a raging fire. Harijans who have at all become vocal are naturally suspicious and often exacting. They are impatient. The sanatanists think that the Hinduism of their belief is in danger. They have money which they are using freely. New organs are daily coming into being.  They impute motives, make the wildest statements about the reformers and distort the whole movement. The workers are not all an ideal team. I have seen how one worker can poison the whole atmosphere around him unless he is thoroughly trustworthy and is pure in mind and body.
 If the worker is to satisfy both the Harijans and the sanatanists, he will do so only by showing the highest character, deep humility and great charity. In other words, he will have to be a man of religion. This is a movement for the purification of religion. No religion has ever been purified by brag and bluster or by men with a loose character.
Workers will have to be most circumspect. Sanatanists are
 reported to be resorting to goondaism and not to hesitate to resort to force to break up meetings. This is no wonder. Evil has its own vested interests. These are undoubtedly in danger. And they will put up a fight for existence. Where, therefore, there is any danger of disturbance, the workers must avoid it, even if they have to give up public meetings and the like. In such cases they must take the message of deliverance from house to house. They must not engage in vain disputations or interpretation of Shastras. They must rely upon the unfailing ability of Truth to protect itself. Truth is life and it propagates itself the moment it has got a habitation in some human personality. Mute conduct is often the most effective speech. Workers, therefore, need to have a living faith in themselves and the cause. But they know that by themselves they are nothing. Therefore, faith in themselves means faith in God. Those who empty themselves of all pride and all egotism have the greatest help from God.
 Hinduism will be purified of the evil of untouchability only by the willing sacrifice of thousands of such true servants.

 "
23,,ARE TEMPLES NECESSARY?,"
  
 An American correspondentlibtech_11_footnotelibtech_12_footnotewrites:libtech_13_footnote
 . . . The great religious truths which the prophets of religion have apprehended and proclaimed have always been lost when their disciples have tried to localize them in priestcraft and temples. Truth is too universal to be confined and made sectarian. Therefore, I consider temples, mosques and churches to be a prostitution of religion. . . . When religion is made a monopoly by the priesthood and temples become vested interests, the great mass of mankind becomes isolated from truth. . . .
 Therefore, I can see no advantage in gaining permission for  the  Harijans to enter the temples. I know that justice demands that they shall have the liberty even to do wrong. But if they are to learn the lessons of self-respect which will enable them to take an equal place with caste people in the development of the future of our civilization, I think they must learn an independence of all priests and temples.       When you spoke in Europe that
 you “formerly considered that God is Truth but now you realized that Truth is God”, you struck a responsive chord in the hearts of all of us, whatever our traditions may have been. But when you become a defender of the faith of temple Hinduism, even though it be a purified type, we feel that you have lost
 
 your universal appeal, an appeal which I consider you to have made not as a Hindu, but as one of that large body of spiritual-minded Hindus who do not look to the temples for the spiritual sustenance of their lives. I do not believe that such men are outside the best traditions of Hinduism but are rather in the line of the creators of the religious spirit which has made the spirituality of India her greatest contribution to humanity.
 Nor do I believe that this higher Hinduism is too high for the Harijans, whose spiritual intuitions have never been dulled by our modern type of education. Buddha, Chaitanya and Kabir all made a large appeal to this class, and the teachings of Jesus were most appreciated, not by the high and mighty, but by publicans and fishermen, who were outside the pale of respectable society. . . .
 This considered opinion representing a large body of people throughout the world deserves respectful consideration. Such an opinion, however, does not appear before me for the first time. I have had the privilege and opportunity of discussing this subject with many friends in the light it is presented. I can appreciate much of the argument, but I venture to think that it is inconclusive, because it has omitted material facts. Some priests are bad. Temples, churches and mosques very often show corruption, more often deterioration. Nevertheless, it would be impossible to prove that all priests are bad or have been bad and that all churches, temples and mosques are hotbeds of corruption and superstition. Nor does the argument take note of this fundamental fact that no faith has done without a habitation; and I go further that in the very nature of things it cannot exist, so long as man remains as he is constituted. His very body has been rightly called the temple of the Holy Ghost, though innumerable  such  temples belie the fact and are hotbeds of corruption, used for dissoluteness. And I presume that it will be accepted as a conclusive answer to a sweeping suggestion that all bodies should be destroyed for the corruption of many, if it can be shown, as it can be, that there are some bodies which are proper temples of the Holy Ghost. The cause for the corruption of many bodies will have to be sought elsewhere. Temples of stone and mortar are nothing else  than a natural extension of these human temples and though they were in their conception undoubtedly habitations of God like human temples, they have been subject to the same law of decay as the latter.
 I know of no religion or sect that has done or is doing without its house of God, variously described as a temple, mosque, church, synagogue or agiarilibtech_14_footnote. Nor is it certain that any of the great reformers including Jesus destroyed or discarded temples altogether. All of them
 
 sought to banish corruption from temples as well as from society. Some of them, if not all, appear to have preached from temples. I have ceased to visit temples for years, but I do not regard myself on that account as a better person than before. My mother  never  missed going to the temple when she was in a fit state to go there. Probably her faith was far greater than mine, though I do not visit temples. There are millions whose faith is sustained through these temples, churches and mosques. They are not all blind followers of a superstition, nor are they fanatics. Superstition and fanaticism are not their monopoly. These vices have their root in our hearts and minds.
 My advocacy of temple-entry I hold to be perfectly consistent with the declaration which I often made in Europe that Truth is God. It is that belief which makes it possible, at the risk  of losing friendships, popularity and prestige, to advocate temple-entry for Harijans. The Truth that I know or I feel I know demands  that  advocacy from me. Hinduism loses its right to  make a  universal appeal if it closes its temples to the Harijans.
 That temples and temple-worship are in need of radical reform must be admitted. But all reform without temple-entry will be to  tamper with the disease. I am aware that the American friend’s objection is not based upon the corruption or impurity of the temples. His objection is much more radical. He does not believe in them at all. I have endeavoured to show that his position is untenable in the light of facts which can be verified from everyday experience. To reject the necessity of temples is to reject the necessity of God, religion and earthly existence.

 "
24,,WHY N0T SIMPLE ‘HINDU’?,"
  
In the course of a letter, a caste Hindu correspondent writes:
 If these depressed classes are finally to be merged in the Hindus, was it not better that instead of ‘Harijans’ they should have been given the name ‘Hindus’ which would have applied to both the caste Hindus and the depressed classes? It is still time that the word ‘Harijan’ is given up in favour of the ‘Hindu’, so that the caste Hindus and the Hindu depressed classes are known in common parley as well as in Government papers as only Hindus.
 The correspondent is too late with his suggestion. If a separate register of untouchable classes had not come to stay, at least for the time being, the common name might have answered the purpose. But the separate register makes it absolutely necessary to know the untouchable classes by some name, and if such is the case, why not
 give them a name that truly befits them and has no ill-flavour about it. I regard ‘Harijan’ as a fitting name, because the caste Hindus cannot be properly considered God’s children, but the untouchables certainly can.
 I have suggested the real method of abolishing the distinction between caste Hindus and Harijans, namely, by caste Hindus perform- ing the purification ceremony of ridding themselves of untouchability and becoming Harijans themselves. And if it was open to anyone to be classified as untouchables in the register for untouchables, I should most decidedly advise caste Hindus to declare themselves as such and to live also as such. That will be a substantial and organic method of amalgamating the two into one body.
 This is the proper place for referring to the same suggestion made by a Harijan friend but from a different standpoint. He says that the best way of getting rid of untouchability is to advise Harijans to adopt names that will never signify an untouchable and to declare themselves also as mere Hindus or as Brahmins, Kshatriyas or Vaishyas. This suggestion was made to me even as early as 1915 when I began the crusade against untouchability. This Harijan had his own experiences and told me that he had travelled from one end of India to the other, that he had freely entered all the principal places of pilgrimage without let or hindrance and that he had taken with him a party.
 When he was introduced to me, I saw no mark about him of being a Harijan. He was dressed like a Brahmin, had a tilak on his forehead, a mala of tulsi or rudraksh—I forget which—and his speech was that of an ordinary Gujarati. He and his party took up their abode in dharmsalas and never had the slightest difficulty, having unhesi- tatingly proclaimed themselves as belonging to one varna or the other.
 My visitor told me that this practice of untouchables hiding their identity was quite a common thing amongst them and that it was growing. He unfortunately received no encouragement from me. I told him that that practice might be convenient for him and the few who could afford the means and had sufficient training to be able to shed some of the habits which marked out an untouchable from the rest, but that the practice of a few, apart from its being dishonest and, therefore, tending to deterioration of manhood, would make no impression upon the tens of thousands of untouchables who could not even stir out of their villages.
 The reply that I then gave applies with equal force even today. The straightest and the quickest method, therefore, is to conduct the movement openly, to know the untouchables as such and yet for caste
 Hindus to treat them on terms of absolute equality with themselves; and as the movement has begun on a very large scale and the declara- tion was made on behalf of caste Hindus in September last that untou- chability was gone, it surely became necessary to know untouchables by an inoffensive name whilst the process of amalgamation was going on. ‘Harijan’ in my opinion was the best name to know them by.

 "
25,,A GROUNDLESS FEAR,"
  
A sanatanist correspondent writes:
 Suppose a sanatanist builds a new temple and appoints trustees for its management; suppose he throws it open to all Hindus of the four castes, but not to untouchables. According to the Anti-untouchability Bill, the disqualification of the untouchables will be inoperative. According to the Temple-entry Bill, if the reformers are in the majority, they will be able to secure the admission of untouchables. Thus, although the person who dedicates the temple may be of opinion that the temple will be polluted by the admission of untouchables, although he may be of opinion that he, and persons who are of his way of thinking, cannot worship properly if untouchables are admitted, yet untouchables will be allowed inside the temple and his express desire will be violated.
 If, however, a sanatanist builds such a temple in, say, Tibet or China or Afghanistan, his desire will no doubt be respected, as there is no Anti-untouchability Law or Temple-entry Law in any of those countries. Thus  a sanatanist cannot worship as he likes in a temple built by him in India if he desires that his brother sanatanists of the higher castes should have the right of entry into that temple. But he will enjoy this privilege if he builds the temple in any other country except India.
 Do you think that this position is satisfactory?
 If I was a believer in untouchability, I should not dread the Bills as my correspondent does. So far as the supposed greater freedom in Tibet, China or Afghanistan is concerned, the correspondent forgets that there is no such thing as untouchability in these three countries, so far as I am aware, and he certainly will not be able there, as he is in this country, to prevent the entry of a single person merely on the ground of untouchability. But even when untouchability ceases to be recog-nized by the law, that fact will not necessarily entitle the untouchables to enter any temple they choose. Thus, a sanatanist who builds a temple for certain persons exclusively builds a private temple and he will have the perfect right to exclude any person he likes, whether untouchable or touchable. All he will not be able to do is to
 exclude a person purely on the ground of untouchability and secure the assis-tance of the law in order to compass his purpose. And even public temples will successfully prevent the entry of untouchables if public opinion is against their entry. All that the first Bill does is to refuse legal sanction to the cult of untouchability. No Hindu temple will, however, be opened to the Harijans till caste Hindus have been converted. Under the second Bill, private temples are uninterfered with and public temples can only be regulated according to public usage, which is always subject to change from time to time. And when a sanatanist builds a public temple for the four varnas, it is only by implication that untouchables are excluded; but if untouchables are merged in the four varnas, surely there is no violence to  the sanatanist’s will, because he could not regulate the religious belief of posterity nor stop its growth.
 The only objection of the correspondent, therefore, that needs consideration is the right of the minority under the second Bill. I have ventured to suggest a compromise which jealously guards the rights of a minority even of one. For, I have no desire personally to interfere with the religious right of a single individual.
 But what the correspondent hopelessly fails to do is to recognize the right of the reformers which he insists upon their recognizing in respect of himself and his co-sanatanists.

         CHI. 	MIRA,        March 	11, 1933 
  	It is 3.15 a.m., 11th, Saturday now. The day of my writing to you 	has become upset owing to the uncertainty of the arrival of your 	weekly letter. This week I had two from you. Last week’s was 	received only on Tuesday and this week’s on Wednesday. But 	yesterday morn- ing I thought I had still to hear from you and I 	devoted the morning to writing other important letters. And then 	when it dawned upon me that there was nothing more to come from you, 	I would not write to you during what you may call office hours. I 	love to write this letter and such others in the early morning.  	I see that you are once more enjoying the company of birds and 	animals. Frogs have somehow or other appeared to me helpless 	creatures. They can’t run, they can’t fly and thus become an 	easy prey to the wily cat. And they seem to look at you so 	appealingly in their helplessness. The monkey on the other hand 	never excites my pity. He is a most resourceful and mischievous 	fellow  and  takes delight in overreaching you. He has no such thing 	as thankfulness in him. And yet I suppose all this is imagination or 	ignorance! If we thrive on knowledge, we seem somehow to do so on 	ignorance and imagination too. ‘It is folly to be wise when 	ignorance is bliss.’ And the shortest and the oldest Upanishadlibtech_16_footnotelibtech_17_footnotesays, 	 “He   overcomes  death through ignorance and mounts to 	immortality through knowledge.” The original words are	and , 	meaning also respectively activity and inactivity, body and 	spirit, attachment and detachment. They can-be made to mean several 	other things without  doing  violence to the text. It is a very 	simple and lofty Upanishad and is also abstruse. It is an epitome of 	all knowledge like the Gita. The latter is perhaps a 	commentary on the former. An old commentator or rather the devotee 	of the Gita compares the Upanishads to cows, the Gita to 	milk and Krishna to the cowboy who milks them.libtech_18_footnotelibtech_19_footnoteBut 	no more of this now.  	I hope your progress continues and will not be interrupted by the 	hot weather which is on us now. Make use of the earth bandage on the 	forehead or a mere wet rag. It has a wonderfully cooling effect.     2 
 What cools the head cools the whole body. I came across a potent sentence yesterday in an American book on the eyesight, a book received from Gregg. It says that a lie heats the body and injures the eyesight. It is true if you would give an extended meaning to ‘lie’. Any departure conscious or unconscious from the laws of nature is a lie. A conscious departure from the known laws is a lie that hurts our moral fibre, not so, or not to the same extent an unconscious depar- ture. But the body is injured in every case. Writers on pranayama claim that the ability to regulate and control breath, enables one to defy changes of climate. The Gita seems to lend support to the belief. This is a field that needs reinvestigation in the light of modern knowledge Kuvalayananda of Lonavala is doing it. Form your lips as you would when whistling and slowly breathe the outside air and you will have an immediate sensation of cooling. When lying flat on the back, remember that the muscles of the back do not expand. Hence your breathing must be extra gentle. It is intended to create a soothing effect on the system and relax it and rest it. There is nothing apart from sleep to relieve tension of the mind and body. Therefore the deep breathing should be taken whilst sitting cross-legged with the body erect like a straight board. All these exercises have to be gentle, deliberate and rhythmic, always on an empty stomach.
 Here the writing was interrupted for prayer and is now resumed after a break of 25 minutes at 4.35.
 I have always found Arnold’s to be on the whole a more helpful translation than any other. “Abstemious” is a wrong word. “Spare diet” is a good expression. vYi means less than enough. What is enou- gh is a matter of conjecture, therefore our own mental picture. The man of truth knowing that man is always indulgent to the body, said, in order to counteract the indulgence, that he should take less food than what he would think was enough; then there was likelihood of his taking what in fact was enough. So what we often think is spare or meagre is likely even to be more than enough. More people are weak through overfeeding or wrong feeding than through underfeeding. It is wonderful, if we chose the right diet, what an extraordinarily small quantity would suffice.
 I am glad Ba is prospering with you and learns Hindi and makes you sing bhajans. Does Mridula sing? She ought to if she does not. She must shed her shyness if she has any still left. How otherwise does she pass the day? She should now be Ba’s secretary or letter-writer.
 My weight now registers at 104. The food still remains fruit and milk (raw). I am taking just now less than one lb. of milk. It is the fruit that keeps up my weight. The elbows remain as they are. No
 cause for anxiety. I have reduced the spinning to a minimum—no fixed quantity. The count just now is anything round 55 and 60. This from devakapas carded on Keshu’s little invention.
Love from us all.

          MY 	DEAR VERRIER,     March 	11, 1933 
  	This time too there was unavoidable delay in replying to your two 	letters. As if this was all God’s design, Alla came in yesterday 	to change the scope of my letter. I wanted this to be a mere 	thanksgiving letter. But Alla’s talk has not made it quite 	possible. She said she had a copy of your letter to me. But she was 	not satisfied. She insisted that there was a promise made by you. 	She does not want the marriage now but she does not want to be the 	liar. She wants you to be the liar !  I gently suggested that 	neither need be one and that in matters of love making mistakes was 	the most common thing in life and that whilst you had never meant 	marriage, she who wanted it might easily have interpreted every word 	and gesture of yours to mean marriage. She would not have it that 	way at all and yet was loath to accuse you of untruthfulness. I told 	her that you were incapable of lying and that if there was the 	slightest suspicion of your having meant marriage you would make the 	admission. You will now tax your memory and if 
 there is anything to correct in the light of what Alla has to say, you will do her the reparation. I think that she ought not to go there yet for some time. Though you and Mary have taken the sacred and most momentous resolutionlibtech_22_footnote, it must have been a terrific  strain  on  your nerves. Mary does not even seem to have recovered from the shock. Though your first letter to me is joint, Mary does not seem to have quite assimilated the truth of the dissolution of the intended tie. My whole heart goes out to her. I have no doubt that such things mean much more to woman than to man. But M. must realize that before God there is no sex or we are all women, His brides married to Him in an indissoluble tie. If she has realized the beauty of this immortal marriage, she must dance with joy that she is free from the bondage of the human marriage. The human marriage is good and necessary if the flesh is weak but if the flesh is strong it surely is hindrance for the servant of humanity that M. has become. Let her remember too, all sacrifice to be true must bring inner peace and joy. She must not therefore brood over what was to be and what was a concession to the flesh. Let her sing out the praise of God for enabling you both to triumph over the flesh. And since she has chosen to be my daughter she has got to write to me without reserve and pour out her heart to me.
 But till you are both composed and have tested yourselves Alla must not go there and must not be induced to do so. She herself does not want to go until the so-called promise matter is cleared up.
 And now I know that my whole heart is with you. My spirit is watching you, praying for all the strength you need. These months must have been terrible for you. May Truth, which is God, shine through your lives.
All my love to you and Mary.

 Only labour with one’s hands and feet is physical labour and one must earn one’s livelihood with such labour. Mental and intellectual ability should be used exclusively for the  service  of society. If we do not use our hands and feet, will we do agricultural work with our intellect? If there is a fire raging, will we try to put it out by composing a poem?
 The maxim “Yoga is skill in work’’libtech_25_footnoteis true. There should be perfect combination of physical and mental work. Mussolini was a blacksmith’s son who did hard labour in his home and who, in his youth, worked as a labourer in a factory carrying bricks to the second floor of the building 120 times a day and went to jail eleven times. But this hard life gave him valuable training. His mind was not slumbering when he did all this labour. If it had been slumbering, why, there have been millions and millions of labourers who have carried bricks and farmers who have worked in the fields but have left behind them no mark in the world.

36,,TO GUJARATIS,"
  
 Harijanbandhu is the Gujarati edition of the English Harijan. That the Gujarati Harijan could not be published simultaneously with the English edition is a matter of shame both to you and to me. To you because the Bombay branch of the Harijan Sevak Sangh did not
 
 have confidence that enough subscribers would be found to make Harijanbandhu self-supporting. A Gujarati gentleman had agreed to make good the loss that would be incurred. But the Gujarati edition cannot at all be conducted at a loss. Moreover, I had insisted that if there was any loss in the beginning, that should be borne either by the Bombay or Gujarat branch. Ultimately Bombay has undertaken to make an experiment for three months and has launched Harijanbandhu.libtech_26_footnoteI hope that the Gujaratis will in the very first week reassure the Bombay branch on this point.
 However, the object in publishing Harijanbandhu is not to take from you one anna for a copy or four rupees annually and thereby to provide maintenance for two, four or more persons. Your subscription will be a token of your desire either to do away with untouchability or to know, if you are an orthodox Hindu, what the reformers have to say. I shall take it that the subscribers to Harijanbandhu pay a fee in order to gather information about the movement to abolish untouchability. If you wish to remove the blot of untouchability from Hinduism, you ought to know what the movement is, how and by whom it is being conducted, what the Shastras have to say on the subject, what the world thinks of it, what part you can play in it and the rest. And Harijanbandhu will give you all this information.
 I hope that your one anna will not be spent in vain. Do not buy Harijanbandhu to please me. I am afraid that a number of people will take Harijanbandhu out of blind love for me even though they may not feel the need. I do not want this.
 I am not at all eager to publish Harijanbandhu merely for the sake of publishing it. I do not have that much time. Do not get upset by the fact that it will mostly contain translations from the English. You will find novelty in these translations. I shall have to write at least something addressed to Gujaratis only. I shall have to bear some burden therefore. To me Harijanbandhu is a special atonement. I have been pouring my soul into this movement. Removal of untouchability is not for me a recent activity, it dates back to the days before my entry into politics, to my childhood.
 But as a result of the Yeravda Pact, that activity has become the subject of a pledge. My fast was a death-bed to me. In accepting the Pact, the British Cabinet honoured it in the letter. But the observance of the pledge taken by the Hindu representatives in the name of the followers of Hinduism constituted and constitutes the spirit. I had explained this to the leaders at that very time. I gave up my fast in the
 
 confidence that the pledge would be observed every moment. For that observance my body was the hostage, and it is that even today. The moment I feel that those who have taken the pledge have weakened, I must again take to my death-bed.
 But I am not eager to die. I am eager to live and commit untouchability to the flames. And if I have to die in order to see that glorious hour, I am ready to die. The mantra of my life consists in making preparations for it. To live while untouchability lives is like a cup of poison to me.
 Now perhaps you will have understood more clearly why my expiation lies in conducting the Harijan in English and the national and provincial languages. I must either helplessly lie on my death-bed or employ whatever strength I have to subjugate the demon of untouchability. The Harijan and other activities are there to put off death. Thereby it is my object to caution the Hindus. There may well be a greater responsibility on me for the observance of the pledge, but it rests also, to a greater or lesser extent, on every Hindu who regards untouchability as a sin. Harijanbandhu will help to show how that responsibility can be discharged.
 Even an orthodox Hindu can, if he tries, learn a lot from this. Those who today have become our foes were yesterday our friends. Harijanbandhu will prove to the patient orthodox Hindus that there was no need for this to happen. There is no place here for bitter criticism. Here all the discussion will be conducted from a religious point of view. According to me, removal of untouchability is simply a religious activity. It may well have many other results, some of which may well be political even. To my mind these are mere sham if they do not have a religious foundation. Instead of enjoying the peace of imprisonment, I would never for the sake of a sham take up  the burden of conducting a big movement outside. God has given me the capacity to observe limits. Hence I am able to draw inspiration from whatever circumstances I may be placed in. There may be disadvantages in being a prisoner, but for the wise it certainly offers the peace that comes from looking into one’s own soul. But at the moment I see that I can get this glimpse into my soul in conducting this huge movement while being a prisoner behind the bars. It is precisely for that reason that I have exchanged my sleep for wakefulness. And Harijanbandhu will every week call upon every Gujarati Hindu to immolate himself in this yajna to purify the Hindu religion.

  "
37,"March 12, 1933",DISPOSAL OF CARCASSESlibtech_27_footnote,"
  
 [March 12, 1933]
 There are several sections among Harijans, e.g., the Chakkiliyans and Madigas in South India and Chamars in Gujarat, who remove and dispose of dead cattle and eat their flesh. Disposal of dead cattle is a sacred obligation and occupation. But the eating of carrion is a most filthy habit, regarded as one of the heinous sins in Hindu scriptures, and it is essential that at this hour of self-purification our Harijanbrethren should be helped to get rid of this habit. But they plead their inability to do so for various reasons. “It is a habit to which we have been accustomed for ages”, they say, “and now it is a positive delicacy which we cannot forgo any more than you can do without your finest delicacies. You should also know that removal of dead cattle is an obligation imposed upon us and we may not shirk it without risking the wrath of the Mahajans; you know, perhaps, that carrion is part of the remuneration for the removal. We are thus tied down to carrioneating for three reasons.”
 The argument deserves consideration. Written and spoken appeals will be of no avail; we must show them the way out. We should first acquaint ourselves with the conditions obtaining in various parts of the country regarding the removal of dead cattle, and have them altered as circumstances may require; we should supervise the actual skinning and other attendant processes and see to the proper disposal of the remains. The removal must be made conditional on a promise not to eat the carrion, and no one should be compelled to remove dead cattle.
 This work demands a fair number of volunteers. They must learn the art of skinning dead cattle in a clean manner and teach it to the Harijans who are doing it today in the old fashion. The carcasses should not be dragged as at present, as it damages the hide and decreases its value. They should be lifted and removed in an expeditious and efficient manner. The hide-curers will willingly adopt the new method, but not until the so-called high caste people have mastered it.
 The way in which dead cattle are disposed of today is most uneconomical and entails a loss of crores of rupees to the country. Every bit of the carcass must be made proper use of. Much of it is
 
 wasted today. The hide, the bones, the entrails and the flesh are all useful and ought to be properly utilized. The hide is being put to use of a sort. The bones are mostly wasted. They should be carefully collected and turned scientifically into manure. The entrails are  utilized for gut, etc., but there is room enough for improvement. The flesh should be saved from the filthy use it is turned to and must be made to yield fat, which will be valuable for manufacturing grease for factories. The remains should finally be converted into manure or buried deep. If volunteers make a point of remaining present throughout all these processes, the men will easily take to the new departure and will stop eating carrion.
 There is nowhere any room  for compulsion. Where the hidecurers are not ready for the change, they must  be  left  undisturbed. They are no more bound to remove the dead cattle than the caste organizations are bound to get them removed by them. It should be a matter of mutual adjustment.
 But the beginning must be made by the volunteers supervising the processes, wherever, of course, the supervision is not resented. The supervision need not be delayed until the volunteers have  first  mastered the processes. Actual work will be a training in itself.
 Municipalities and local bodies and States can immediately undertake the work of training volunteers in scientific skinning and hide-curing. This does need a little expense on buildings and experts. They should really have a training school for this purpose and invite philanthropic experts and veterinary surgeons for co-operation, suggestions and help.

 [March 12, 1933]libtech_29_footnote
 I have already summed up in an article in the last issue of Harijan the qualities regarded as indispensable in a servant of the Harijans. libtech_30_footnoteIf this movement is essentially religious and has for its object the purification and protection of Hinduism, it can be carried on only by truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Truth is the very foundation of religion. If Truth is God, there can be no room for   untruth   in   religion.   Let   every   Harijan   Sevak    inscribe  this
 
 fundamental principle on the tablet of his heart.
 I am being inundated with sanatanist literature. New weeklies and leaflets are coming in daily. Sanatanists have loosened their purse-strings. I like the awakening. How I wish it was on the right lines! The writings I see contain palpable falsehoods. Their sole object is to stop the anti-untouchability movement somehow or other. How can one answer such propaganda?
 Most certainly not by untruth. Truth can be the only answer. I have indeed had complaints against reformers from sanatanists to the effect that the former are resorting to untruth and rowdyism. These complaints have been unsupported by evidence. I have requested the correspondents to supply me with it. Only in one case has an attempt been made to furnish evidence. And I have forwarded the complaints to the proper quarters for investigation. I do not wish to suggest that refusal to furnish me with evidence is proof positive that the reformers are all above reproach. These lines are being written in order to warn them against any departure from truth and non-violence.
 My attempt is to know no distinction between the sanatanist and the reformer. I ask for truthfulness from both. But as the sanatanists refuse to regard me as one of their own—some even look upon me as their foe—I am afraid my appeal will have no weight with them. I should be satisfied if the reformers will listen to my appeal. For, their truth will overcome the opponents’ untruth, even as light overcomes darkness. If, therefore, the Harijan Sevak will pursue every one of his activities with truth as the guiding principle, he is sure in the end to convert the sanatanists.libtech_31_footnote
 I shall certainly declare that no one can destroy the Hindu religion or any other religion by aggression. This is a self-evident truth. That which can be destroyed by any external force is not religion. It may well be a form of social behaviour. Religion can be destroyed only by internal corruption. Untouchability is one such corruption in the Hindu religion. If that is not eradicated, Hindu religion is bound to be destroyed. Untouchability is a monstrous untruth. It can be overcome by contact. Untouchability exists in our hearts. It is a great sin to think, ‘This man belongs to the untouchable caste; so I will not touch him.’ This thought is filled with hatred, with pride, with the notion of superiority and inferiority. All this is irreligion, it is untruth. I know that untruth cannot be supported by truth, hatred cannot be supported by love, pride cannot be supported

 by humility. This is the reason why I see today the sanatanist newspapers full of hatred, pride and untruth. The sanatanist will ask me, ‘Do you not expose your own truth, hatred and pride in saying so?’ Perhaps it is so. I can only assert that to my knowledge I have no such thoughts. When I see them I shall eschew them, then and there. In order to perceive my own faults, I receive the critics with respect, and listen to them; what they write I read as much as I can. The harder  I tried, the more the faults I found in those critics. I do not wish to write about this sad experience here.
 But let the workers know that exaggeration is also a species of untruth. I receive reports about opening of temples and wells to Harijans. But sometimes it has been discovered that all the temples and wells referred to have not been opened and that the information supplied to me has been based on insufficient data. The Dhulia Anti-untouchability Committee has published a small pamphlet containing a list of temples and wells opened all over India. It is an imposing list, but I am not inclined to accept it at its face value, not because the Committee has been careless in its compilation, but because it had no opportunity of testing the accuracy of the information supplied from all-India sources. Very often workers gain their information from newspapers, instead of being themselves suppliers of information to newspapers. Statements received from Anti-untouchability Committee cannot be accepted as conclusive evidence, if they are based upon untested reports published in the daily Press. And then there is the great temptation to swell the list of temples and wells opened, for fear of my fast being precipitated. It is a disheartening thought for me and it betrays a poor opinion of the great movement. My fast was not designed to coerce people in any shape or form. It was designed merely to make Hindus think and to spur them to action. Truth is made of sterner stuff, and it must be held superior to any life or lives, be they ever so precious. It must live even if a million lives had to be sacrificed. In a big, religious movement like the drive against untouchability, which many believe to be an integral part of Hindu religion, nothing but unadulterated truth and unconquerable faith in the cause will avail. The reformers hold untouchability to be itself the biggest blot on Hinduism, a great lie. If it is, it can be defeated only by truth and gentleness.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got the mail you posted on the 9th. I am dispatching this hoping that you will get it on Tuesday.
 I had a postcard from Ramabehn. She says that you have not called on her yet. About helping her to learn English,  you  may discuss the matter further with me, but my understanding of the letter in which I advised you to go and see her is that the suggestion was not open to discussion. Ramabehn had told me, and that is also what she indirectly suggests in her letter, that you would never take the initiative to call on her. I had told her that that could not be so. You should prove that I was right.
 Is it true that Bablalibtech_32_footnoteescaped drowning in the Magan tank? How and when did the accident occur?
 I had received your wire about Parachure Shastri on Friday. If all of you came to the decision independently, it is to be highly welcomed. Kaka has conveyed it to Parachure Shastri. He has gone to his place just now. I will let you know what he decides. I hope Lakshmi’s wedding went off well. The bride and the bridegroom may come and see me if they wish. I think Maruti does.
 I hope you got the letters posted yesterday. They contained one for Lakshmidas in which I wrote to him about Anandi.

         CHI. 	PREMA,     March 	12, 1933 
  	Your argument is worthy of an M.A. “If someone can hang himself 	upside down, why can I not play music?” Many other questions like 	this can be framed. The only reply is that no reason can be given 	why you may not. If one person can do one thing, why may another 	person not do something else?  	But it is certainly possible that someone who hangs himself upside 	down may be able to give a valid reason even for such an action, 	while a person like me who then starts playing music may not be able 	to give a convincing reason for doing so. But let that pass. You 	should now put your proposal before the other inmates of the Ashram 	and, if a majority supports it, by all means go ahead and make the 	necessary preparations. Being a prisoner, I myself will not be able 	to join that marriage procession. And a prisoner has no vote either, 	so you need not consult me. Q.E.D. I 	will patiently wait for Dhurandhar’s letter.  	Whether you reply to my question or not, I will keep on inquiring 	about your health. Tell me, therefore, is it all right? Is the 	throat all right and can you speak? How is the backache? Is your 	weight increasing?  	When the time comes for giving away the yarn which I am spinning 	with the slivers sent by you, I will certainly give it to you if you 	continue to deserve it even then. I hope you will be satisfied with 
 this answer. The count of the yarn will not exceed 75. There are fairly numerous rough particles in the slivers. It is possible  that  even Keshu’s machine is not good enough for devkapas. I hope you know that this variety of cotton cannot be carded with the ordinary bow.
 I don’t know anything about Mahadev having been offended. Nor did I know that he had written to anybody about the matter. I knew something from Narandas’s letter. I knew about disrespect only from your letter. Mahadev has told me nothing. Nor did I know, when  I asked him to spin [with your slivers], that he found himself in a moral  dilemma.libtech_39_footnotelibtech_40_footnoteIn  this   matter   your   case   seems   to   be   perfectly correct. I did not feel disrespect to anybody in your remark or your request. I don’t know why Mahadev felt it. I am observing silence just now, otherwise I would have asked him. I did feel, however, that your request sprang from ignorant attachment. Why should you have such attachment for me? One should eschew attachment for a person who cannot belong to any one individual but daily strives to belong to all. Such attachment can avail nothing. But this is one thing. To deduce from it a dislike for others is a different thing.
Sardar, I believe, was only joking, as is his wont.
 And now see how I valued your love. Surely you will agree that I should make what I believe to be the best use of the slivers sent by you. Wouldn’t that be the best way of showing how I valued your love? If a vaid, out of his great love for me, sends me gold  bhasmalibtech_41_footnotelibtech_42_footnote, would it not be right to give it to my neighbour to whom it might be more useful than to me? Or, if somebody sends me a carriage to drive and if my neighbour can drive it more safely than I can, would I not show better appreciation of the donor’s love by letting that neighbour drive it for me? The same argument applies to slivers. Among us here, Mahadev can make the best use of such fine slivers, and so I gave half the quantity to him. This will test his skill and increase national wealth and I also will feel happier. You should, therefore, change your nature which makes you wish that your gift should be used only by the person to whom it is given. If you make a gift, you should do so unconditionally. Sushila’s description of you was correct. If Kisan was not likely to get in time the fruit which were brought for her, you would have served both Sushila and Kisan by eating it yourself. It was foolish of you to have let them rot. Q.E.D. again.
I am sorry I cannot reply to your last question.
 
 I hope you have had long talks with Lakshmi.

          MY 	DEAR MARY,        March 	13, 1933 
  	I must dictate this. I have your letter describing Babla’s 	exploits. He is in many ways a precocious child and therefore you 	will find him having picked up all kinds of odds and ends, many of 	them quite correctly, and if you were to ask him where he picked 	them up he might not even be able to tell you, because in things one 	picks up there is no conscious effort.  	I am glad you are sleeping out. After years of experience I can say 	that there is nothing like sleeping directly under the sky to soothe 	one, so much so that even the roof of a mosquito-net has proved a     
 hindrance for me as if there was an obstacle to the direct contact with the heavens. That of course does not mean that you should hesitate to adopt the net if mosquitoes worry you even when you are right under the sky. You must have the net if at all you are disturbed by the mosquitoes. I don’t want you to have malaria in the Ashram through mosquito bites.
 You are quite right and wise in not making for speed till you have got control over the strength and evenness of your yarn. When you have both, the speed will come for the trying.
 I am wholly unconscious of any danger or difficulty surrounding me, and don’t you give way to any forebodings. One step enough for me is the command we may not break.
 I have not yet got your Hindi written at Parashuram’s dictation. When I get it I shall examine it and let you know the result of my examination.
 I hope you duly got my letter addressed to you jointly with Duncan in reply to your joint letter.
Love.

 March 13, 1933
 MY DEAR GAURISHANKAR,
 I have your letter together with resolution of the Rajasthan Oppressed Classes Conference. I fancy that I missed the Times of India report.libtech_48_footnoteAnyway, I have no recollection of it. Nevertheless, I am glad you have drawn my attention to it as also to the feelings of the Harijan friends there. I wish you would explain to them the origin of the word ‘Harijan’ as it is given in the earliest issue of the  Harijan.libtech_49_footnoteThe word has had a mixed reception. The majority of those who have written to me rather like the name. After all, it was adopted at the suggestion of some Harijans themselves, and those who suggested the name were themselves representatives.
 
 So far as the suggestion that the whole movement should be “left in the hands of the depressed classes” and that the Board or Boards should only assist them by their guidance, [is concerned], it is not practicable in that the penance has got to be done by caste Hindus, therefore, it is they who have to prove their sincerity by conducting the movement. No doubt it should meet with the approval of Harijans if it is at all possible to secure it. But the penance has naturally to be done by the penitent himself and not by deputy. I can well understand  a parallel movement of reform by Harijans and it should be there. It must also be the natural consequence of sincere penitence by caste Hindus.
 As to the third suggestion, I do not know whether Sjt. Sarda is a proper representative of the Board or not. As to that, you should write to the Central Board.
 Lastly and fourthly, the programme of the anti-untouchability movement is in no way confined to the temple-entry, but it is designed to improve the economic, social and educational conditions of these classes. Temple-entry is a part of the programme, and it is contended that it not only ensures for Harijans religious equality but it conduces to the acceleration of the pace of economic, social and educational programme. You will please explain this to all the Harijan friends and others whose misgivings you have expressed in your letter. You were quite right in bringing to my attention the various points.

 SUJNA BHAISHRI,
 I got your letter. I would be content to accept from you as much as you can give. I must, therefore, make my request and leave the matter to your discretion. In relation to you, I am in the same position as Ramabehn. If she does not get something from you, will she complain about that to me?
 You seem to believe that you are immortal and that, therefore, the people are safe. But the truth is that in matters in which action by the Ruler is essential, he must act. “Ruler” here may mean, if you wish, his Executive Council or the Assembly. Responsibility must vest with some individual or body so that a tradition may be maintained. When I analyse even your method, I discover the same thing, namely, that power is being exercised, though secretly. You may deceive yourself and the people that things go on by themselves, but the truth is that nothing goes on by itself. Hence in regard to such problems as removal of carrion, admission to schools, etc., about which something ought to be done and about which public opinion also is favourable, legislation is essential. Where there are no laws, there can be no government but only anarchy or misrule. Even Mussolini pretends to run a government. Nobody should object to a declaration that the Durbar, that is, Bhavnagar State, does not recognize untouchability. Sanatanists may, if they wish, continue to follow the practice and enforce it by social sanctions. You follow many principles in your own family, but try and see if you can enforce them in  your  immediate circle in which you have influence. You will not succeed. You can declare, without hurting anybody, that for the Ruler all subjects are equal. Having done that, don’t mind if no child from the so-called untouchable communities can attend your schools. I have written a note in the Gujarati Harijan about the problem of carcasses.libtech_51_footnoteFind some time and read it. Some of what I have said there is addressed to you, though no particulars of name or place are mentioned. Though both of us are old, we are greedy. We have even the courage to do service. We give away all the money we may have. But you have to run a State, and your hair has become grey under the burden. You should also cultivate the company of persons like me. You have accepted a difficult Superficially it might seems that your path and mine are different. Both of us have the same aim and pursue
 
 the same goal. Must you, then, insist every time that you will follow your own method? Well, have it your own way. I am concerned with the result and leave niceties of methods to politicians. I will be happy if you can satisfy the Harijans somehow.
 I am afraid I have not expressed myself very welt but I hope you will generously overlook the insufficiency of the letter.
 Take care of your health. I have received much from you, and wish to have much more still.

 March 13, 1933
 RESPECTED BHAI,
 I have your letter. I will not give up hope of you, nor should you give up hope of me. Many have been able to get along together in this way. It has also happened that some were not able to do so. I shall not dismiss our case as belonging to the latter category. It is in God’s hands. However, I shall go on trying.
 All reformers are not pure. Nobody is pure. But many struggle to be pure, many love dharma. They believe that untouchability is really an inner matter and that it has no external sign. We must all keep away from such untouchability. No one is born an untouchable. If there is anything in Hinduism which is not to be found in any other religion, which promotes dharma, it should be amenable to rational proof. And its result should be manifest to the eye. The theory of untouchability by birth neither appeals to reason nor has it any visible beneficial effect. If you say that Antyajas should be helped except in the matter of admission to temples, why should you not regard it your dharma to give such help? If you don’t wish to give  such help through me, you may give it independently.
 You also see the continual degradation of dharma. But do you think it can be prevented by laying exclusive stress on external cleanliness? I am not averse to such cleanliness. I think I observe all rules of cleanliness which I know, but I don’t believe that their observance purifies me spiritually. They help me to preserve physical cleanliness. For preserving spiritual purity, it seems to me that what is necessary is observance of rules of internal cleanliness. These we have forgotten altogether. The result is that, though we have forsaken
 dharma, lost our spiritual strength and remain absorbed in worldly pursuits, we believe that our dharma is safe and, if somebody like me comes forward to wipe out the blot of untouchability, a loud cry of dharma being in danger is raised and lies are spread against that person. I do wish that people like you should not lend your support to such activities and that is why I plead with you. On matters on which we differ, we should try to understand each other’s point of view and, in regard to other things about which we have no differences between us, we may work separately but with the same aim. If all of us do this, the waste of energy that is taking place at present would stop.
 Read this letter when your mind is free from other worries. I am sure you will be able to get some time in Adhoi.

 DEAR DR. SHARMA,
 I have your letterlibtech_56_footnotelibtech_57_footnotetoday and I reply at once before deciphering Amtussalaam’s. What I would like you to do is to go over to the Ashram, see the patients who are still there and will be for some time, and see whether they can be treated there without being removed to a cooler climate. After all, it is not quite so hot in Ahmedabad as one may think till April. The nights are perfectly cool and I have not found even the summer to be trying. I have not hesitated to take my own cure in the Ashram more than once, even though I was advised by some doctors to go to a hill station or at least to a seaside place. But you shall judge for yourself, and then if you find it  to  be necessary I shall endeavour to select a cooler place. Your going to the Ashram will serve a double purpose. You will know the place and surroundings and you will have your first experience of it. You will also be able to deal with cases of obstinate constipation which are common enough in the Ashram. There are two patients there who are chronic asthmatics and who do not generally go to watering places
 
 and try to keep as much as possible in the Ashram itself. You can go to the Ashram whenever you like, and if you want to  take  Amtussalaam with you, you can do that also.
 I am glad your daughter was cured of smallpox through natural treatment.
 If you propose to go to the Ashram, you have simply to send a telegram or a letter telling them when you will reach there. I will send a copy of this letter to the Manager.
 Yours sincerely,

 March 14, 1933
 DEAR THAKKAR BAPA,
 I have been very slow in sending you the draft   constitutionlibtech_58_footnotelibtech_59_footnote. Now I have your telegram. I was ready with it only last Sunday and then it awaited the dictating of this letter when your telegram was received. You will see what labour has been put into it. The draft as it comes to you is the 3rd draft prepared by Mahadev. I was simply supervising and suggesting. I think I told you that I read it first and found that it required a lot of re-drafting and thinking out. It was then handed   to   Shastrilibtech_60_footnotelibtech_61_footnote.   Shastri   went  through   it   carefully   and   made suggestions. Then Mahadev tackled it. So, you may say that it is the result of the joint labours of three persons. Before it is printed, it should be passed by the Committee of the Society. I feel that Harijilibtech_62_footnoteshould apply his legal mind to it and, as a lawyer, make what amendments and additions he may think necessary before it is considered by the Committee. If he cannot give it the necessary time, it should be put in the hands of some lawyer who is experienced in drafting constitutions for societies such as ours. No labour now given to it will be a waste of time and effort if the Society is to grow into a big and efficient organization. Constitution alone will not do it, I
 
 know, it will be the workers who will perform the trick. Nevertheless, without a good workable constitution we will not be able to bind together the different units composing the organization and its branches. After you have the final draft for passing, if there is any time, I would like you to send me a copy of that draft, for, you should know that I have not examined the enclosed draft in all its details.
 I am anxious to receive your impressions in detail of your Punjab tour, your experience of the Harijan leaders. Swatmanandjilibtech_63_footnoteappears to me to be an able man. He is a polished Hindi writer and seems to have original ideas. He tells me that he met you. He has sent me a copy of the representation that was submitted to you by his Society. As you have seen from his report which I have sent you he has no faith in the chief caste Hindus working the different anti-untouchability organizations. We have to give him as much satisfaction as is possible, and if there is nothing whatsoever in his charges, we should be able to tell him so and support our statement with convincing evidence.
 I know I have deprived you of the only secretary  who  was giving you the fullest satisfaction. If you had pleaded your inability to part with Shastri, I should have managed somehow. I have not the courage now to say, “You can have Shastri if you wish”. At the same time I know that you must not remain without an efficient secretary. Would you like me to make a search? If you will, let me know your exact requirements and what you are prepared to pay.

Whenever you make a mistake, I will correct you. I wrote about Jamnalalji to reassure you. Go on with your search within the limits of propriety. It will please me if you get married before Jamnalalji comes out. Do not let even Narandas’s warning upset you. I both understand and fail to understand your partiality for Gujarat. Surely I can have no aversion to a Gujarati girl. It will therefore be quite good if you can find a
 
 suitable Gujarati girl. There will be nothing to object in the girl you ultimately get since we do not wish to form an unsuitable connection. Your being easy in mind makes me so, too. Now it is indeed time for you to leave for Almora. Even so, I leave it to you when to go.
 You have not even told me Motiba’s name. To whom should I address the letter? However, I have managed somehow. The letter is enclosed.

       MY 	DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS,     March 	16, 1933 
 I 	am able only today to reach your letter of 8th March.  	What I meant about a Selection Board was this. You should appoint a 	small and efficient committee consisting of, say, a man like Thadani 	and someone from St. Stephen’s College and another person as 	Secretary with you and Thakkar Bapa as members ex-officio. This 	Committee would invite applicants for the David Scheme 	Scholarships.libtech_72_footnoteIt 	will examine the applications and recommend them to the Board. The 	Board will, if it accepts the recommendations, grant the 	scholarships. This Committee will also be invited to  frame  a 	scheme giving conditions under which scholarships should be given 	describing the qualifications of the candidates and it will be under 	these conditions that applications would be invited. I would suggest 	the Committee keeping in touch with Mr. David in so far as he may be 	willing to assist the Committee with his informal guidance and 	advice.     
 So much about the Selection Board.
 With reference to the donations, I am not satisfied with what you say. I had the fear that there might not be an adequate response to an appeal for such donations. I had said as much to Mr. David when I told him why even though I liked his scheme I was reluctant to back it publicly. I advised him therefore to consult you and to consult the Bombay Board which he did, and both of you warmly took it up. You even advertised it in the draft constitution. I therefore felt encouraged after having waited for a long time to bless the scheme in the Harijan.  I do feel that there must be some earmarked donations apart from the general collections. I do not like the idea of setting apart sums from the general collections already made. We must draw, if we at all can, some sanatanists among the donors. Anyway, that’s my idea, and that’s also Jamnalalji’s, Sardar Vallabhbhai’s and of all of us. I have already approached Janaki Devi to give the scheme Rs. 2,500/-and I am presently going to write to others. I would like to include your name among the donors and publish it.
 Before writing anything in the Harijan, I shall await your considered reply to this.

  	I have your letter about Prof. Purandarelibtech_77_footnotelibtech_78_footnote. The thing is this. He had delivered some addresses in 	Poona. He was brought to me by Haribhau. Haribhau told me that his 	addresses were well received, and so in order to begin the 	propaganda and in order to help Purandare I suggested that his 	speeches should be published in book form. He was quite agreeable. 	He told me that his wants were very few and that he would gladly 	dedicate himself to the cause. I asked him to tell me what he would 	require for his labour in collecting the  speeches, perhaps even 	rewriting them, examining proofs, etc. He would not name the sum 	although I pressed him hard. But he told me that he would be 	entirely satisfied with whatever I named and got from the Central 	Board. When the book was finished and the time came for payment I 	hesitated to name the sum. I therefore referred the matter to 	Haribhau. He suggested Rs. 125. I immediately accepted the  amount 	and had the cheque prepared, when, lo and behold, Prof. Purandare 	declined to accept the money and wanted “Rs. 1000, if not Rs. 	3,000”.  	Since then the story is one of my receiving angry letters of abuse 	and nothing else. That, however, is not a matter of much moment. I 	told him that he could have the book against payment of      
 the printing charges. He disputed the reasonableness of the printing bill saying that it was exorbitant. I said I would accept any sum that might be fixed by an independent arbitrator. He would not accept that. There is much more that I could write, but I think this is enough.
 Now, I am acting as a Trustee for the Central Board. How can I possibly ask the Central Board, without the slightest justification, to pay more? The translation rights, etc., he can have. There is not much demand even for the books that we have. I would gladly say that if there is any surplus left after discharging the printers’ bill, he should have it. What more is it possible to offer?

 MY DEAR THAKKAR BAPA,
 I promised to write to you at length in reply to your complaint of the 11th instant.libtech_79_footnotelibtech_80_footnoteYou have done well in writing as freely you have done. That enables me to explain what I have done. Perhaps your letter was dictated without your having seen the Harijan. I dealt with Swatmadas’s letter without mentioning his name, or the Province, or the organizations and purposely gave it a general colouring, so that even Swatmadas could not make out that I had built my articlelibtech_81_footnoteon his letter, and you will be agreeably surprised to know that Lele thought that it had reference to Bombay. This is the way I have successfully dealt with so many things for over a generation. But at the same time I did not want to wait till you had dealt with the report yourself and were able to send me your observations. That would have been a long drawn out agony, whereas what I wanted to do was to drive a lesson home as early as possible. The particular Province and the particular complaints about particular organizations were left untouched and awaited treatment till after you had examined the whole question. Do you see anything wrong in this method? Have the  Punjab organizations been compromised in any manner or Swatmadas given undeserved credit? In the hypothetical article in the Harijan I have not
 
 even said that the writer’s complaints were true. I simply called for self-introspection on the part of the uplift organizations throughout India. And let me tell you that that article is serving its purpose. It is still open to you, and I want you to investigate all the complaints of Swatmadas and give me your reply so that I can deal with them. I know that the Punjab organizations mentioned by Swatmadas are not all affiliated to the central organization. That should not matter. Nor need these organizations take it amiss if we made courteous enquiries of them. Their reception of your enquiry would naturally depend upon the manner of it. You, I know, would always write in a courteous tone and a perfectly friendly manner, and make your intention perfectly clear that you wanted to help them as a friend and not approach them in an inquisitorial manner. However, that is really my suggestion. You will do whatever you think is proper, and if you think that no enquiry is necessary you will say so and I shall be quite satisfied. My purpose is served if I have made it clear to you that there was nothing improper in my having dealt with the  subject anonymously and in a perfectly general manner.
 As to Swatmadas himself, I was not at all unprepared for your description of him. But we have to deal with and come in contact with such young men. It is inevitable. We are responsible for what they are and it serves us right. Therefore we have to deal with them in the gentlest manner possible, listen to them most patiently, and try to take what service it may be possible to take from them. I think this covers all the points raised in your letter.
 I hope you had my letter sent you on the 14th, and the draft constitution went to you yesterday by registered post. I sent you a telegramlibtech_82_footnotealso advising you of its despatch.
 Your description of the Punjab Alienation of Land Act makes bad reading. Can nothing be done to correct the mischief? I would like you to send me a copy of that Act.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I have your letter of the 11th. What you say is perfectly correct. This seems to be the last ordeal. I should like to sacrifice everything in it. However, if we could always to do what we liked, all of us would be kings.
 I have already informed you that Parachure Shastri has gone to his place. My previous letters may have helped you to arrive at your decision, but it was my duty to leave the decision to you which in my impatience I failed to do.
 From whom has Parashuram borrowed? The news has perturbed me. Who has been lending him? Give me all details. Let me know Parashuram’s weaknesses. We should tolerate much, but please remember that there is a limit even to that.
Co-operation and non-co-operation either may be one’s duty.
 A pair of brass pots, a thali and a tapeli—I hope Lakshmi will not get crushed under the weight of all these things. Even these are marks of love, however, but I am glad that you refused to be a party. I am also glad that Velabehn and others decided to give something. I cannot judge from here where the limit should have been put. Didn’t  I myself wish to give Lakshmi a string of beads, when I was reluctant to give anything to Rami? Love shows itself in such contradictory forms. I do not doubt your sincerity in the least [in refusing to join]. It is the wisdom of giving a pair of pots which should be doubted.
 You will read the copy of my letter to Dr. Sharma which I am enclosing. I will not therefore write more on the subject. Do you agree with  what  I  have  written  to  him?  A  letter  for   Marybehnlibtech_83_footnotealso   is enclosed.

I will not write in detail as you will see that letter. It is not at all correct to say that the Ashram is the hotbed of phthisis. The fact is that there is hardly any phthisis in the Ashram.

         CHI. 	MIRA,       March 	17, 1933 
 This 	is Friday morning 3.15. Your letter came in due time.  	I must be brief today as I have many other important letters to 	write. I have no doubt whatsoever that your progress will continue 	if I have succeeded in explaining my instructions about deep 	breathing and gentle breathing whilst lying flat on your back. With 	plenty of good  bhajilibtech_88_footnoteconstipation must yield. Whilst you have to avoid 	bread, paupau should be taken if available.  	I suspended my saltless last week without making any change in the 	diet. I simply began taking salt with the fruit—not more than 30 	grains altogether during the day. The only change I can report is 	that the weight went up yesterday to 105. There has been no increase 	in milk or fruit. But I am not able to say whether the increase is 	due to salt. We shall see.  	Verrier seems to  have  calmed  down  now  and  definitely  off the 	marriage. Whether they will ever accept the restriction as to 	intermarriage between members of the same Ashram, it is difficult to      
 say. I am going to make the suggestion in your name.

79,"March 	17, 1933",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
       March 	17, 1933  CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	While waiting for the others to arrive for the morning prayer, I 	wrote out a letter to Mirabehn and one to Ba. I made them brief and 	started this. I read Narahari’s letter and your two letters. I 	have discussed these only briefly. Where is the time? I however put 	down the thoughts which occur to me.  	You should invite Narahari to see you and try to understand his 	point of view. I know his temperament very well. He is one of the 	few sincere workers who have come together in the Ashram. They 	should all learn to become one as milk with sugar. If they cannot do 	this, the Ashram is bound to perish. Naturally, it is the 	responsibility of the secretary to see that different parts of an 	organization work in harmony. It is my duty to explain this clearly 	to you. The secretary is the centre of an organization. Those who do 	not feel the pull of his attraction are outsiders in that 	organization. The secretary  should either free them or give them a 	proper place in the organization and keep them in it. You cannot 	regard Narahari as an outsider. We look upon certain persons as the 	limbs of the body that is the Ashram. We can never imagine the 	Ashram without them. If we can imagine it without them, we can 	imagine it without ourselves too, which would mean the end of the 	Ashram.  	I have only stated the principle. You may draw from it what lesson 	you can.  	Narahari should be regarded as an expert in the field of education. 	In that field, therefore, we should subordinate our views to his. If 	in conesquence we find that mistakes are being  made,  we should let 	them be made and draw the expert’s attention to them afterwards. 	There is no other way, and there can be none. If anybody tries to 	point out my mistake in my own field, I would not readily admit it. 	I must, therefore, taste the bitterness of failure. This holds true 	of all other fields. In this, too, I have stated only the general 	principle. 
 All persons of the category of Maganbhai should have free access to the books. If as a result some books are spoiled or lost, we should write them off rather than create unpleasantness. The rules for using the books should be pasted on the walls at numerous places. In big libraries, even ordinary members are permitted to take them out of the shelves. If they do not put them back in their places after they have done with them, they leave them on the table, and at the end of the day the librarian puts them back in the shelves. The inmates of the Ashram should have free access to the books. They can have the keys whenever they wish. If you cannot decide who should be treated as inmates of the Ashram, you may draw up a list of selected names of persons who should be permitted to take out books and ask for the keys.
 If the children go to bed at 8.15 p.m., they should be permitted to sleep from 8.30 p.m. to 4.30 a.m. without fear. In addition, they should also get one full hour during day-time for sleeping. You will have to consider who may be described as children. You may respect the parents’ wishes in this matter.
 A teacher should get time to prepare himself. I cannot accept Chimanlal’s excuse that he gets no time. If one undertakes a job, one must do it well, otherwise one ought not to undertake it. To undertake  a job and not to do it well is a form of untruth. If a person who is driving a car does not drive it carefully, he will be committing a crime. Similarly, if a person who has undertaken to teach something does not do it well, he will commit a greater crime than that driver. Nobody should undertake anything which is beyond his capacity.
 We should faithfully obey Kuvalayanandji’s instructions regar- ding exercise.
 The conclusion to be drawn from all this is that all of you should sit with Narahari, discuss the problem frankly and do what you think best.
 However, do only as much from this as you can easily do. I am far away from there. After all it is you who have to decide and act. It is you who have to run the Ashram and will have to accept the responsibility. I may, therefore, make suggestions to you but you should have complete freedom to accept or reject them. You should assume that you have that freedom.
 Prema also is involved in all this. She should learn to control her tongue and restrain her obstinacy. She behaves in such a manner as to wipe out all that she does. Try to persuade her as much as you can. If you wish to free her from any responsibility, you may do so. If her working the whole day does not let her have peace of mind, she
 should reduce her work. If she has such peace, she should be able to listen to criticism from anybody.

80,"March 	17, 1933",LETTER TO C. F. ANDREWS,"
       MY 	DEAR CHARLIE,    March 	17, 1933 
 We 	are all so glad that your brother is getting better.  	The Harijan tells you all about the activities in connection 	with untouchability. Though the storm is raging on all sides, 	somehow or other I am enjoying perfect peace. This temple-entry 	question is indirectly solving many spiritual problems. It has given 	and is still giving the movement its real religious background. Many 	thought, and some still think, that the question is purely political 	and economic. It is now being recognized that everything else 	depends upon the religious conversion of caste Hindus. For, that is 	the significance of temple-entry. It may be that the religious 	conversion may not come at all in our time. It may turn out that I 	had underrated the strength of the superstition. Nevertheless, the 	issue is becoming clear day by day. Untouchability will not have 	gone without temple-entry and all it signifies—temple-entry not at 	the point of the bayonet but at the will of the people. I have not 	yet succeeded in showing the sanatanists that the two Bills do not 	seek to interfere with Hindu conscience in any shape or form. They 	are simply meant to remove the legal obstacle to the freest exercise 	of Hindu conscience. It has been a matter of great grief to me that 	Government have not seen this very clear intention of the two Bills. 	But I have purposely refrained from dwelling on that aspect in the 	Harijan. I have simply remained satisfied with having 	writtenlibtech_89_footnotelibtech_90_footnoteto the Viceroy. Love 	from us all to all.

         MY 	DEAR N.,       March 	17, 1933 
  	I have your letter. I had intended to write this letter in my own 	hand, but that could not be done. An unexpected visitor came on the 	scene and I became helpless.  	My spirit hovers about you as a mother’s about her lost child. I 	would love to own you as a child, but I have not got that trust in 	you yet. It may be no fault of yours, but there it is. You should 	know the whole of my mind. That is the only way I can guide you and 	the only way in which I can ever own you as a daughter.  	I do feel that you are again in a trap. There is only one spiritual 	husband, companion and friend to all, both men and women, and that 	is God, whom I know more fully as Truth. Before God alone there is 	no sex. He alone is pure spirit. All other marriage, however 	lofty-minded both parties may be, is more or less carnal. For a 	person who has dedicated himself or herself to the service of 	humanity there is no such thing as exclusive relationship.  	If, therefore, you will take my word, you will not travel from error 	to error, as you seem to me to be doing just now. Your promise is to 	have no exclusive or secret or private companionship. You are simply 	wedded to your work and nothing else. You 	should write regularly.  	May Truth, which is God, be your sole guide, friend, companion and 	rock of ages.

  	Though as a vegetarian I do not like the idea of poultry-farming and 	chicken egg-selling, I am unable to say that no Harijan Seva 	Organization should do so, and if you feel like introducing that 	industry, you should unhesitatingly do so.

I do hope you got all my previous letters, as also the Harijan which 	is being posted to you every week. Love 	from us both.  Yours 	sincerely,  BAPU  Spiegel 	Papers. Courtesy: Nehru Memorial Museum and Library. Also  S.N. 	20602       March 	17, 1933  CHI. 	NARAHARI,  	Why did you tear up your letter to Mahadev? Just think how much 	anger and violence there was in your action. Narandas put the pieces 	together, reconstructed the whole letter and sent it here. It was 	not right for you to tear up the letter, no matter how much at fault 
 Narandas was. I have gone through your letter and also the brief reply Narandas has sent to Mahadev. I have conveyed to Narandas in short the impression which was produced on me, and have suggested that he should show you that letter.
 It is true that my trust in Narandas is as complete as you have heard it is. That is my nature. It is not that I have such trust in him alone. I have similar trust in you, Panditji, Kaka and others whose names you yourself can supply. I would never  believe  anything against any of them unless I had direct evidence. Hence, there was— should have been—nothing surprising in what you heard. Apart from it, this is what I believe regarding Narandas. He has in  him the qualities of efficiency, patience, power of discrimination, balance of mind, impartiality and firmness, of the highest order. They have cast a spell on me. I therefore wish that you and other co-workers should appreciate his qualities and take full advantage of his  services. However, he cannot have these merits, nor can others see them in him, simply because I attribute them to him. How can you help if you fail to see them? And it is clear that if you fail to see them, you cannot avail yourself of his services even as much as you may wish. So much about my faith in Narandas. Apart from that, however, I liked your letter very much. It is not necessary, and I have not the time, to analyse the letter in detail or point out your errors that it shows. I think I have drawn from it the necessary lesson. You will see this from the suggestions which I have made to Narandas.
 What I expect you to do is that you should see Narandas, have a quiet discussion with him and persuade him to make the changes which seem necessary to you. Do not press the points which Narandas finds unacceptable. I don’t think that you wish, or believe it desirable, that the charge of the Ashram should be entrusted to somebody else. Do tell me if that is what you wish or think. But if that is not so, your duty is to persuade Narandas as much as you can. You are responsible for the welfare of the Ashram quite as much as I or Narandas or others. We are what we are, and it is we who will make the Ashram what it will be. You cannot, therefore, regard yourself as an outsider and disclaim responsibility for it, since the bond among the inmates of the Ashram is an indissoluble one as that in a Hindu marriage. The Gower Bill has not still been passed into a law; but even when it has, those who wish to adhere to the present form of indissoluble marriage will certainly do so. The Gower Bill has for its subject matter forced marriages and ill-matched pairs. I am sure you will not regard our marriage as of that type. It is a marriage of choice. You should bear this in mind and know that you have no choice but to endure what is inevitable and act accordingly. I have read your letter in some haste.
 If there is anything in it about which I should do something but which has escaped my attention please do let me know.

         DEAR 	PROF. SOARES,     March 	17/18, 1993 "
92,,NOTES,"
  	I was delighted to meet you yesterday and have the interesting 	information that caste is observed among Goan Christians and that it 	was confined to the restriction upon inter-caste marriages.  	If you can give me comparative statistics about the population of 	Harijans and other Hindus and the occupations of Harijans in Goa or 	rather Portuguese India, I shall be obliged.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 20597       EVILS 	A RESULT  In 	the Telugu districts as 	well as 	the adjoining Tamil 	districts, Madigas and 	Malas, both of 	whom are 	at presents untouchables, 	kill cows and buffaloes 	for purposes 	of sacrifice 	to Matamma 	Mariyamma and Gangamma. 	There is no 	doubt that a 	certain number of 	caste people 	also take 	vows before these 	goddesses in 	times of 	emergency and 	calamity, but 	the actual sacrifice is 	done by the 	so-called outcastes. The 	untouchables not 	only sacrifice 	animals in 	public but 	eat the beef. They also 	eat carrion. 	Caste Hindus do not, 	but they 	do freely 	eat pork. 	I would 	request you, therefore, 	to advise 	the untouchables 	to give 	up this 	sacrifice and 	carrion-eating. The 	latter is 	responsible for 	their physical 	degeneration. Could 	you not also send a 	message for 	us who 	are working 	in the 	cause of anti-untouchability?  	This is a condensed extract from a long letter from the Secretary of 	the Andhra Provincial Ryots’ Association. There is no doubt that 	this habit of carrion-eating, and especially beef-eating, has a 	great deal to do with the prevalent prejudice, but in no other thing 	 is  the weakness of Hinduism, or rather of caste Hindus, betrayed 	so forcibly as in regarding a portion of fellow-Hindus to be 	untouchable and neglecting them in the cruellest manner possible. We 	have, therefore, only ourselves to thank  that  the  untouchables  	are  what  they are.  But it is not yet too late to mend. The 	Harijans should realize that 
 untouchability is dead and gone. Its evil effect will persist for a long time to come. The duration will be the measure of our joint neglect. Greater by far is the responsibility of the caste Hindus. If they will do their duty and work whole-heartedly, they will certainly succeed in stopping these sacrifices and the habit of carrion-eating. Nothing but the spread of enlightenment is required to rid the community of evil superstition and evil habits. But I cannot too often remind the  reformers and caste Hindus in general that they will not purify Harijans of any single one of the evil habits, if they will make the reform the condition of the removal of untouchability. Rather let us realize that the evils are a result, and not a cause, of untouchability, anyway most decidedly not at the present moment.
 So far as carrion-eating is concerned, the reader will find concrete suggestions which I have made in the Gujarati columns of Harijanbandhu and which have been translated for these columns.libtech_92_footnote
 CHRISTIAN HARIJANS
 ‘Christian Harijans’ should be a contradiction in terms. For, untouchability that is sought to be driven out of India is the special curse (according to the reformers) or the privilege (according to the sanatanists) of Hinduism. But the Hindu contact has so infected the Christian that at least in Malabar it seems to show itself among Christians almost in the same form as among Hindus. Thus writes a Malabar Christian to Sjt. Amritlal Thakkar:libtech_93_footnote
 From the days of the famous Vaikom Satyagraha, the real condition of the Travancore Harijans . . . has been brought to light to a very great extent, but it is not yet suspected or detected, . . . that the Christian Harijan in Travancore is not [sic], in matter of civic or social rights and in abject poverty, absolutely the same as his Hindu Harijan brother. Pulayas or Cherumas, Parayas or Sambhavas with Ignaoas or Ina Pulayas and some other minor communities number about 6,00,000 according to the last year’s census report and are considered the lowest strata of the outcaste societies of Travancore.
 Converted (Christian) Pulayas or Parayas as a whole are as good, or as bad, as the others of the communities, except in a few cities like Trivandrum, where the difference, if there is any, exists more in pretension of  the  converted, though hardly any in reality, and where a handful of them may be a little more literate or a little better employed than those of the others.
 Public institutions, roads, inns, rest houses, temples, churches, court houses, business houses, shops, streets and even taverns that are unappro-
 
 achable by the one are exactly to the same extent unapproachable by the other. To both, caste men like Nambudiris are unseeable to this day.
 Prosperous (Christian communities like Nadars in the South and Syrians in the North . . . are to us what no-change sanatanists are to our Hindu Harijan brother. Hundreds of churches unapproachable by us (Harijans, either Christian or Hindu) will explain why Christian Harijans of the bottom ranks have to make common cause with their fellow outcaste brothers. . . .
 Allow us to add that we, being agricultural serfs mostly, have been and are dependent on the caste Hindu and Christian masters and that, owing to increasing poverty and fragmentation of land, we are day by day reduced to greater and greater economic plight, . . . .
 This state of things is no doubt a disgrace to Hinduism but it is no less so to Christianity, if not more so. The present movement is automatically helping the Christian Harijans, but I should be surprised if advantage is not being taken of the movement to drive out untouch- ability from the church. I hope too that the  numerous  educated Nadars and Ezhavas are putting forth their best effort to abolish the distinctions among Harijans themselves.

93,,WHAT HARIJANS THINK,"
  
 The reader must have read and digested what Thakkar Bapa, as he is endearingly called in Gujarat, especially by Harijans, said in the telegraphic account of his tour in the Punjab, published in the last issue of Harijan. Harijan deputations that waited on him have sent me copies of the addresses they presented to him. The one from the Ad Dharma Mandal of Jullundur City and Balmic Ad Dharma Mandal of Lahore City contains these observations:
 The high-class proud Hindus of the Punjab Province have degraded and lowered our position in the society to an unbreakable extent. They think themselves to be polluted if we happen to touch them. Our entry at the public places and getting water from the public wells and tanks is thought objection- able. Hindu washermen and barbers are not prepared to serve us in their respective occupations. We are not allowed to dine at Hindu hotels. We are not privileged to use bands, palanquins on the occasions of our marriage celebra- tions. We are forced to carry the palanquins of Hindu brides at their marriage. If we happen to put on good clothes, they irritate them. The depressed classes of the Punjab Province are faced by many troubles. High-class Hindus have pressed and degraded them from all sides. Caste question has proved very troublesome. Even the houses in which they live are not considered their property. In the villages and towns their economic condition is very much
 degraded, and for their uplift a vigorous campaign of propaganda is required.
 If the condition is as bad as this in the advanced Punjab, what must it be in the other Provinces of India? And as would be clear from Thakkar Bapa’s wire, law seems to have conspired with the caste Hindus in depriving the Harijans of even the right of owning agri- cultural land. Let us hope that the numerous uplift associations of the Punjab will make a united effort to remove at once some of the numerous disabilities enumerated above.

94,,EVEN UNTO THESE LAST,"
  
 For the heading of this article I have dared to steal from Ruskin a classical phrase stolen by him in his turn from the Bible. I have added ‘even’ to the original and changed ‘this’ into ‘these’ to bring out the whole sense of what I want to say. Among the Harijans the poor scavenger or the Bhangi seems to stand last in the list, though he is perhaps the most important and indispensable member of society, as indispensable to it as a mother is to her children in one respect. The Bhangi attends to the sanitation of society as a mother to that of her children. If the caste men had to do the scavenging for themselves, some of the methods that the Bhangi has to submit to for doing his work would have been swept away long ago. I copy the following from a letter of the Anti-untouchability Board of Muttra to its Municipal Board:libtech_94_footnote
 . . . He must be a heartless fellow who has remained unmoved at the pathetic sight of a slender, aged and emaciated woman carrying, and being crushed under, the weight of a basket full of night-soil over her head every morning from the city lanes to the trenching ground or the flushing pit. The practice, though old, is inhuman, cruel and a relic of barbaric days. It is most unhygienic. The solution is simple. Just purchase hand-driven trolleys and
 let these speechless servants of yours use the trolley as a carrier rather than the head. Another matter for your consideration. Every privy should be provided with metal or earthen basins, so that the process of removal of night-soil may be rendered less uncleanly.
 Let not the reader laugh at the somewhat high-flown language of the writer. What he has said is God’s truth. The Bhangis have hitherto done their work uncomplainingly, and therefore the caste men have not cared to know how these have served society for centuries. If we had not regarded these servants of society as
 
 untouchables, we would not have shut our eyes upon them or their work. Having chosen to do so and having confined them to infernos, we ourselves daily descend to these infernos called privies and do not care to look at the dirt about us or to notice the stink that pervades these places. What is true of the Bhangis and the municipality of Muttra is true more or less of all the Bhangis and all the municipalities of India. The reform suggested by the Anti-untouchability Board of muttra is most desirable and can be undertaken without much cost by every municipality.
 I read the other day a notice in the Leader of Allahabad of the scavenging work, inaugurated by a zamindar, in the Allahabad streets, and hardly had the work gone on for two days, when the enthusiastic young men who had undertaken this glorious service thought of replacing the baskets by a better arrangement. Let me again quote, this time from the Leader dated February 27:
 An effort is being made by the anti-untouchability workers to replace the baskets at present in use by the sweepers for the disposal of rubbish from private latrines with light iron hand-carts fitted with detachable buckets. According to the proposed scheme, the cost of such carts would be borne by the employers of the sweepers. It is understood the Manager of the Allahabad Law Journal Co., has generously undertaken to have a model baby filth removal cart constructed at his own expense for propaganda work. According to the scheme, every private latrine would have to be provided with two receptacles. An anonymous donation has been received from a high caste Brahmin woman for the construction of a public bath-room at or near  Kalimaika Asthan. This work would be undertaken as soon as proper drainage and water-supply arrangements are made by the municipal authorities in the locality in question.
 I hope that the enthusiasm has not died down during the weeks that have intervened between the date of the report and now. Some earnest workers have simply to persist and the much-needed reform can be inaugurated in every town and city.
 If the report that a Brahmin lady has generously come forward with her donation for the construction of a public bath-room is true, it would delight the heart of Sjt. Hiralal Shah, who has been energeti- cally pursuing his proposal for bath and change of clothes for swee- pers after they have performed their daily task.libtech_95_footnote
 There are thus three reforms which can be with a little forethought and very little extra cost inaugurated throughout India, resulting in comfort and cleanliness for Harijans and promotion of the
 
 health of society in general. All that is required is that we should behave ‘even unto these last’ members of society as we would unto ourselves.

95,,POSERS,"
  
An iconoclast schoolmaster asks the following three questions.
  Is 	it necessary for 	a Hindu, 	following the life 	of Shri 	Ramachandra, also to go and see his image in the temple? Is darshan better than action?  If 	we bow our head 	or join 	our hands 	before a living 	person, he replies 	in return, 	but the image 	does not. Then what is 	the use of 	doing it? 	What is the use of writing letters to one who never replies?  The 	person, whose image a 	Hindu adores, might have 	committed some 	wrongs in 	his lifetime. 	Will not the adorer 	be harmed 	by copying 	those wrongs, which he is likely to copy if he worships his image? 
 Questions like these have been asked and answered often enough before now. But the temple-entry question has revived them and they torment honest doubters like the correspondent, as if they had never been raised and answered before. I must do the best I can, though I doubt if doubters like the correspondent will be satisfied.
 It is not necessary for any Hindu to go to a temple to worship (the image of) Ramachandra. But it is for him who cannot contemplate his Rama without looking at his image in a temple. It may be unfortunate, but it is true that his Rama resides in that temple as nowhere else. I would not disturb that simple faith.
 The sub-question in the first question is badly put. There is no question of comparison between the darshan and the deed. If there was, I would unhesitatingly say that the deed is better. But the function of darshan is to enable the deed to be done, to steady and purify the soul. Thus, darshan is not a substitute for right doing. It is an encouragement for it.
 In asking the second question, the schoolmaster has missed the whole point of temple-worship. When I bow to a living person and he returns it, it is a mutual exchange of courtesy and there is  no  particular merit about it. It may be a sign of good breeding. Temple- going is for the purification of the soul. The worshipper draws the best out of himself. In greeting a living being, he may draw the best out of the person greeted, if the greeting is selfless. A living being is more or less fallible like oneself. But in the temple, one worships the living God, perfect beyond imagination. Letters written to living persons often end in heartbreaking, even when they are answered, and
 there is no guarantee of their being always answered. Letters to God, who, according to the devotee’s imagination, resides in  temples, require neither pen nor ink nor paper, not even speech. Mere mute worship constitutes the letter which brings its own unfailing answer. The whole function is a beautiful exercise of faith. Here there is no waste of effort, no heart-breaking, no danger of being misunderstood. The writer must try to understand the simple philosophy lying behind the worship in temples or mosques or churches. He will understand my meaning better if he will realize that I make no distinction between these different abodes of God. They are what faith has made them. They are an answer to man’s craving somehow to reach the Unseen.
 The third question shows, perhaps, that the correspondent has not taken the trouble of understanding the Hindu theory of incarnations. For the faithful Hindu, his  incarnation is  without blemish. Krishna of the Hindu devotee is a perfect being. He is unconcerned with the harsh judgment of the critics. Millions of devotees of Krishna and Rama have had their lives transformed through their contemplation of God by these names. How this phenomenon happens I do not know. It is a mystery. I have not attempted to prove A. Though my reason and heart long ago realized the highest attribute and name of God as Truth, I recognize Truth by the name of Rama. In the darkest hour of my trial, that one name has saved me and is still saving me. It may be the  association  of  childhood, it may be the fascination that Tulsidas has wrought on me. But the potent fact is there, and as I write these lines, my memory revives the scenes of my childhood when I used daily to visit the Ramji Mandir adjacent to my ancestral home. My Rama then resided there. He saved me from many fears and sins. It was no superstition for me. The custodian of the idol may have been a bad man. I know nothing against him. Misdeeds might have gone on in the temple. Again I know nothing of them. therefore, they would not affect one. What was and is true of one is true of millions of Hindus. I want my Harijan brother, if he wishes, to share this temple-worship with the millions of his co-religionists, the so-called caste men. It is the latter’s duty to throw open their temples their Harijan brethren. Temple-worship supplies the felt spiritual want of the human race. It admits of reform. But it will live as long as man lives.

96,,THE DANGER OF IMITATION,"
    
 I am a humble student of philosophy and so I thoroughly appreciate the movement for the removal of untouchability which has hindered the progress of a large portion of mankind. I can also appreciate the way of penance by fast, but there is one difficulty in my way. You know that the Bhagavad Gita has said, “What the great ones do, the others follow”, and if a great soul like you set the example of fasting, is there no danger of others blindly imitating you, and quoting your example in support? Then again, you talk of the inner voice, and everybody will claim to speak in the name of the inner voice, and it will be held responsible for mixed marriages, mixed dinners, and consequent disruption of society. And when such reckless indiscipline takes place in the name of the inner voice, how would you propose to raise the level of the ordinary men, especially of untouchables?
 I must confess that I have considerably abridged the original which is fairly long. But I am sure that the substance of the correspondent’s argument has not in any way been lost in the abridgment. My answer is simple. I accept the teaching of the Gita verse that the correspondent has quoted. Surely, it was meant to warn leaders against conduct that might, if copied, result in harm to society. It cannot possibly apply to conduct whose intelligent imitation can do no harm. For if it did, it would mean an end to all progress and the setting of good examples. There is no such thing in human affairs as insurance against all danger. There is always danger of even the most irreproachable conduct being misinterpreted and misapplied, but the right thing has got to be, and has always been, done, in spite of the risk of misinterpretation and misapplication. I hold my fast to have been wholly good and obligatory on me. If the whole of mankind imitated the fast subject to all its conditions, no harm could result. A fast that was calculated to affect a big movement for the better could not be given up because of the fear of some people abusing it. Penitential fasting is admittedly a good institution.
 And lastly, fasting is its own safeguard against abuse. Not many people would be willing to fast, and much fewer still would be able to do so, even though they might be willing.
 Much the same may be said about the inner voice. Nobody has to my knowledge questioned the possibility of the inner voice speaking to some, and it is a gain to the world even if one person’s claim to speak under the authority of the inner voice can be really sustained. Many may make the claim, but not all will be able to substantiate it. But it cannot and ought not to be suppressed for the
 sake of preventing false claimants. There is no danger whatsoever if many people could truthfully represent the inner voice. But, unfortunately, there is no remedy against hypocrisy. Virtue must not be suppressed because many will feign it. Men have always been found throughout the world claiming to speak for the inner voice. But no harm has yet overtaken the world through  their short-lived activities. Before one is able to listen to that voice, one has to go through a long and fairly severe course of training, and when it is the inner voice that speaks it is unmistakable. The world cannot be successfully fooled for all time. There is, therefore, no danger of anarchy setting in because a humble man like me will not be suppressed and will dare to claim the authority of the inner voice, when he believes that he has heard it. Unbridled  licence  is undoubtedly in the air. Everywhere one sees unrest, whether in the religious field or any other. The spirit of independence is abroad. Youth has always been found to be most impressionable and, therefore, it has naturally fallen a prey to this spirit; and in its haste to realize independence it has missed the central fact that independence can only come out of interdependence and that it is a fruit of long training in self-restraint. It has forgotten that independence is never synonymous with indulgence. The blame for the wildnesses of youth lies, therefore, at the door of the spirit of the times. It would be wrong to impute it to the assertion of sterling independence based upon a conscious practice of self-restraint and an ever-increasing effort implicitly to obey the will of God speaking within and then known as the inner voice.
 It is now, perhaps, easy enough to answer the third question of the humble philosopher. The only way to raise the level of Harijans is for the Harijan servants to raise their own level by prayer and penitential fasting and by so training their acoustic faculty as to listen to the inner voice.

 DEAR DR. ALAM,
 You have certainly supplied me with sufficient material to precipitate a quarrel in the family, but as I am a votary of ahimsa, you are quite safe. But whatever Begum Alam might have to say about your betrayal, you have certainly done me a good turn. For you have given me in Anwar one more charming corrrespondent in Urdu. Even for selfish reasons also, therefore, I shall avoid being a cause of
 quarrel between you and Begum Alam.
 I am glad you are getting better and that you will be soon going to Calcutta for finishing the course of treatment. Let us hope that will be the last. You will be glad to know that we are all keeping well, often thinking of so many of our mutual friends.

 March 18, 1933
 DEAR SATISBABU,
 I did not like your telegram to the Harijan. It was published by Shastri as he did not know all the implications and had no time to refer it to me and so used his own discretion and published it. If it had come to me, I would have withheld it. My own view you will learn from the copy I am sending you herewith of my replylibtech_98_footnotelibtech_99_footnoteto the British Indian Association. As you will see, that letter too is not for publication. I think until there is any danger we should try to affect the opinion of pro-changers by arguing with them but not engaging in a public controversy which instead of easing the position, will only aggravate it. If the controversy forced itself upon our attention, we should not hesitate to take it up. So much for our conduct.
 Now, for the quality of your argument. You cannot say that untouchability is a greater curse in Bengal than in  Madras.  That means that it is of a more virulent type in Bengal than in Madras, which is certainly not the truth. In fact, there is no pollution by touch or sight or shadow in Bengal as in Madras. Bengal untouchability is peculiar and confined to the restriction upon the handling of water. Bad as even this is, it is wholly different from the unthinkable  atrocities of the Madras type. What you want to say is that the number of untouchables according to the Bengal definition is much larger in Bengal than in Madras. If you had put the argument that way, it would not have lost its force. All therefore that was necessary was to remove the offensive sentence: “I repeat . . . Madras.” And, are you right in saying that the Government definition is identical with the definition of S.U.S.libtech_100_footnotelibtech_101_footnote?  Then you cannot omit the fact that some of those who are classed as untouchables by the Bengal Government themselves resent the inclusion. You also seem to think that the councillors want to repudiate   the   Pact   wholly   and   restore   the   original.libtech_102_footnotelibtech_103_footnoteI   have   not understood their demand in that light. If it was so, it would be most regrettable. I think that all that they want is to reduce the number of seats allotted to Harijans in Bengal. It will be time enough to act when they approach the parties interested in the Pact. I think that our
 
 profession of ahimsa should also guard us against rushing to print till we have tried every means of conciliation outside publication in the Press.
 This is how I feel, but it may be that you had ample justification for sending the wire and wording it as strongly as you have done.
 I read the Hindi translation of your preface to the Bengali Ramayana. It is a very good thing indeed, full of the devotional spirit. I look forward to the balance of proof sheets.

 MY DEAR MENON,
 I like your letter of the 9th instant. There is just one difficulty in accepting your argument, but it is a big difficulty. Your argument is as ancient as the hills. If it had held good, progress would have been impossible. Is not yours the argument of prescription? But prescrip- tion cannot run in favour of error. Therefore every practice must be tested on the anvil of universally accepted morals. Not even the so-called divine revelation can avail against a practice or belief which runs contrary to fundamentals accepted as such by mankind, and I have seen as yet no argument whatsoever from this universal stand- point in defence of the practice of untouchability.
 I need not combat your argument on the Temple-entry Bill, because I know that you are carefully following the pages of the Harijan. Nor need I worry you with my answer to the other paragraphs of your letter. I believe you to be a seeker and, therefore, I have little doubt that you will reach the truth sooner or later, and if I mistake not, sooner rather than later.

  	I hope you will not resent this letter, nor my dictating it. The 	impression left on my mind by long conversations with N. is that you 	and other young men who have come under her influence have not 	really benefited by it and that you have contributed to your own and 	her fall. She happened to show me one of your letters. I did not 	like the unduly familiar style of address, nor the contents of your 	letter. I fear very much that you have taken liberties with her 	which, as young men of self-restraint, you and your associates 	should never have taken with a stranger. N. tells me that you are 	talking about spiritual mar-     
 riages or spiritual friendships bordering on marital relations. This is nothing but playing with fire and an echo of very subtle sensuality. I therefore fervently urge you and the other young men not to play with fire, and not to be instrumental, consciously or unconsciously, in preventing the moral progress of N. who has only just begun to perceive the immorality of her past life. You should recognize that she has a pliable nature. She has hitherto not even understood that what she was doing was horribly untruthful and essentially immoral. I hope you will not misunderstand my letter. Probably, when I was convalescing in Bangalore some years ago, I saw all of you young men, but whether I did or not, I have no other feeling towards you except that of a parent to his children, and it is under a sense of that self-chosen responsibility that I am writing this letter to you in the hope that you will put yourself right, if what I have said carries conviction to you, and by refraining from any familiarity with N. help her to outgrow her past life.
 You can share this letter with your associates and I would like you to share it with N. I feel for her deeply because I believe that in spite of her untruthful and immoral past she has great capacity for sacrifice and service."

Like 	every other industry, this hand industry too requires a high degree 	of technical skill, as a matter of fact in some respects higher than 	what is required     
 in a spinning and weaving mill. Every branch in the latter is standar- dized. Nothing can be standardized to perfection in handicrafts, because each craftsman’s manufacture has its own individuality and when it comes to handling the individual work of a thousand such persons, it baffles the most skilled organizer. Relief through spinning and weaving has, therefore, like everything else, its own limitations, if it has also the largest potentiality of all relief works. If we had an agency commanding the knowledge of thousands of experts and enough pecuniary resources, we should be able to provide good remunerative work for everyone in need, and it will prove compara- tively the most remunerative to the needy as also to the agency. But unfortunately we have not that army of expert workers nor sufficient pecuniary resources.

112,,A WORTHWHILE SCHEME,"
    
 The scheme published by Shri Hiralal Shah regarding the cleanliness of Bhangis is worthy of consideration. The aversion to the Bhangis is due to the kind of work they do. Here it is beyond doubt that the entire fault is that of the so-called high-caste Hindus. But I have not started writing this to blame anyone. We have to consider what our duty is at present and Shri Hiralal’s scheme will help us in doing so. The scheme is this: They should wear a special dress when they carry filth and after they have done the cleaning they should be encouraged to take a bath and change their clothes. Right now they would do neither of their own accord. The object may be achieved only by persuasion and by giving them requisite facilities. Munici- palities can take up this work on a large scale, but all the householders who utilize the Bhangis’ service can do so in a small way. They should employ their own Bhangis, should suggest to them to bathe, should give them the facilities for bathing and should themselves provide them the separate dress. One Bhangi family serves many houses. One who is conscious of the value of cleanliness should find out the other employers of his Bhangi and should take their help in providing him with a dress; thus no one will find the expense too burdensome. If this kind of work continues for some time the Bhangis will develop the habit of remaining clean and untouchability, in so far as it stems from dislike, will be eradicated. No one should ignore this easily practicable suggestion by falling a prey to the age-old folly that everyone’s work is no one’s work. Whoever is in a position to do the work should make a beginning with it and draw other people behind him.
 Along with this, there are two other reforms which can immediately be put into effect: the reform of latrines and in the mode of carrying filth. The so-called high-caste people have kept the Bhangis at a distance, so that their latrines are like the abyss of hell, and the Bhangis are compelled to carry filth in a very odd and cruel way. Improvements in latrines can be easily introduced. The main requirement is dry earth. The practice of carrying baskets of filth on the head should be done away with. This movement has already begun   in   Mathura   and   Prayag.libtech_117_footnoteThere   the   filth   is  carried   in   a hand-cart instead of on the head. It is possible that the cart cannot be taken everywhere. In such cases, the filth can be carried in a bucket
 
 hung on a rod. Where the bucket is not heavy, it can be lifted by hand. The practice of carrying the filth on the head is one which can be stopped immediately.

113,,ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS,"
    
 ADMIT AFTER SHUDDHIlibtech_118_footnote
 Requiring shuddhi for Harijans is to grant that they are not Hindus. But then our whole movement is based on the principle that the Harijan community is an important section of Hindu society. Therefore whatever is to be done in this matter has to be done only after abolishing untouchability. Moreover, who will perform the shuddhi and for whom? One should have shuddhi of the heart. Only a pure, i.e., a perfect man can perform for another the sacrament of shuddhi. So the very idea of going through shuddhi according to certain rites is unthinkable to me. In any case, this kind of shuddhi cannot be a condition for the removal of untouchability.
 But I cannot prevent you or anyone else from implementing your proposals. It is clear that it will not have my support. But I will not oppose you if you can admit Harijans of your area to the Sringapatam Temple after performing the ritual of shuddhi as suggested by you.
 EVERYTHING WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH PURITYlibtech_119_footnote
 Certainly, there is no end of difficulties. I am certain too that patience alone will solve them all. Our means ought to be absolutely pure. Untouchability has spread under the guise of religion. It won’t be destroyed as long as it is not confronted with pure dharma. We are not forming a new sect but are endeavouring to cleanse an existing one. He who points out a fault in another ought himself to be free from it. That is to say the extent of our progress will depend on how pure we are. The sub-division of the untouchables into Dhed, Bhangi, etc., will disappear only when we have done away with untouchability. Work with the utmost perseverance and utmost love, Soften the wrath of the sanatanists with love. Take upon yourself only such work as
 
 you can cope with. But whatever you take up, see it through. Do not stretch your legs beyond the sheet.
 WHY MODERN?libtech_120_footnote
 I do not at all believe that untouchability is as old as or even in any way connected with sanatana dharma.. Various forms of untouchability based on ideas of cleanliness are to be found, more or less, in every country and every civilization. But I do not at all believe that the decadent form of untouchability that we find today ever existed in ancient times. It is not to be found in any other religion. If this kind of untouchability were an integral part of sanatana dharma, that religion has no use for me. I am not foolish enough to lay down my life for this sanatana dharma.
 I expound sanatana dharma as I understand it. If the entire people disowned me on that account my claim of being a sanatanist Hindu would have been rejected.
 DO YOU BELIEVE IN TEMPLES?libtech_121_footnote
 I am not talking of temple-entry for the first time. I have been doing so for years—in fact right from the time I started talking about the removal of untouchability. Even before I took a pledge in public to lay down my life for ending untouchability I had announced that temple-entry for Harijans was an important element in the removal of untouchability. I have myself performed the ceremony of throwing open a number of temples and encouraged Jamnalalji to do so. I make no distinction between a temple and a mosque or a church. Men everywhere worship images in some form or other. And through the image everyone worships God alone though their attitudes and methods may differ. Perhaps you are not aware that I have in my life visited temples on a thousand occasions if not more—sometimes out of politeness, but often with sincere devotion. I did not know you were so intolerant as to regard temples as a greater evil than untouchability. Imagine the terrible consequences of abolishing the  institution, thereby depriving millions of people of the temples that are a solace to them. You equate temple-entry with going to hell! So you think— do you?—that Bharat Bhushan Malaviyaji who has a temple in his
 
 own house and who is a regular worshipper there descends into hell every day and is worse than you and I in the eyes of God. Please delve deeper into the matter and decide for yourself.

114,,WHAT DOES A HINDU TEMPLE MEAN?,"
    
A Harijan worker writes:libtech_122_footnote
 This letter has been written with a pure and good intention and it reflects the views of some, though not of many youths; so I publish it. To my mind there is nothing but excitement in this letter. The writer has no proof to justify what he has said about temples. Perhaps he has not visited Kashi Vishwanath, Puri and Guruvayur. Even if some malpractices are prevalent in these temples, the Hindu pilgrims and visitors are unaware of and untouched by them. One gets there what one goes in search of. A father will look upon a woman as his daughter, her husband as his wife, her son as his mother and a sensualist as his victim. Should the father, the husband and the son forsake that woman because of the sensualits? I have been to the temples at both Kashi Vishwanath and Puri. I must admit that I was not inspired by faith to visit them, but I had seen  innumerable innocent souls going there with devotion. I did not pity them, but I fell in love with them and I could understand their devotion. These numerous devotees had no idea whatever of the malpractices prevalent in temples. One must bear in mind that wicked acts take place secretly and only a few people have knowledge of them. Devotees attribute perfection to God. The devotees’ God is full of innocence, that of non-devotees full of faults. The Krishna of the innumerable Hindus is a perfect incarnation. To the critics Krishna is immoral, a gambler, a liar and so on. The mind alone is the cause of bondage and of deliverance. The young correspondent must know and understand this eternal truth. Just as human beings cannot think of the atman without the body, similarly they cannot think of religion without temples. The Hindu religion cannot survive without temples. There is corruption in
 
 the temples; it may be in some persons but not in all. An idol is a stone to one who merely goes through the ritual of worship, but to a true devotee it is all life. There is room for reform in the temples. It is not proper to demolish them. Demolish the temples and you destroy religion.
 Moreover, the putrefaction that has set in is not to be found in all temples. It is not there in many temples in villages. The many superstitions prevalent among the villagers have no connection with the temples. Temples are veritable museums of the cultures of different religions. In old times, God dwelt in the temple and  godliness too; it housed a school, a dharmasala; and it was the place where the leading people of the locality met together. Such temples are still to be found in many places. Harijans have set their hearts on temples to such an extent that they build their own temples of sorts. We discern their helplessness in these temples. As long as the Harijans cannot enter the temples of caste Hindus, their helplessness will never end, their Hinduism will remain incomplete; in spite of being the sixth finger of Hinduism, they will only remain uncared for. No Hindu should doubt that the first and all-comprehensive sign of their admission into Hinduism is temple-entry. It is the height of ignorance to believe that the Harijans have fared well by remaining outside the temple. By remaining outside the temples, they have remained outside everything. And even today the attempts made by the sanatanists to keep them out of the temples suggest that they want to perpetuate their exclusion.
 The letter in question makes sad reading despite the noble views expressed in it. It depicts the pitiable condition  of sophisticated modern youth. Young people may perhaps be angry at this statement and may believe that people like me deserve to be pitied. But my experience clearly shows how ignorant they are.
 I have visited many temples in my childhood. That did not at all have any bad influence on me. Today I see many of my friends going to the temples. They know nothing of their shortcomings, but they are aware of the vices of the temple-goers. They are quite untouched by those vices. I do not consider it a mark of greatness that I do not visit temples. I feel no need to go to temples; hence I do not visit them. To secure temple-entry for the Harijans does not necessarily mean taking them into a temple. Those will visit it who wish to. Those who go there will not get a stigma and those who do not may possibly lose something.
 Now a few words about the law. In the same heat of  excit- ement in which the writer has condemned temples with little or no
 justification, he has here also exposed his ignorance.  In  spite  of having some acquaintance with me, he did not ponder over the fact that, if I who depend the least on law believe in the necessity of it in respect of temples, there must be some potent reason for it. Now he may understand that reason. Today the law says that not a single temple is open to the Harijans and a trustee who opens it for them is liable to punishment. In the circumstances, if we do not demand a law to do away with such a state of affairs, the temples will never be thrown open to Harijans. The help of the law is indispensable. A bad law can only be abolished by a good law. There is no other way at all. Here we have not sought the interference of law but the doing away of such interference. Those who concede that a law is required even to nullify a bad law can understand that the movement is to get enacted for the Harijans a law of that type.

 Harijanbandhu, 19-3-1933
 "
115,,VARNADHARMA,"
    
 A   Harijan   worker   puts   me   the   above   questionlibtech_123_footnotelibtech_124_footnote.   I   am   not understood because I do not believe in what we today regard as the varna system. Varnashrama as we see it today implies restrictions as regards untouchability and intermarriage and inter-dining among the varnas. I regard today’s untouchability, in Akha’s language, as an extraneous growth fit to be rejected. It is not the Shastras but only usage that supports the restriction on intermarriage and inter-dining as part of the varnadharma.
 As against this, the varnas have an intimate relation to one’s profession. The pursuit of one’s calling is one’s dharma. He who forsakes his, falls from his varna. He himself is destroyed, his spirit decays. That man causes confusion of varnas and thereby society is harmed and its organization breaks down. When everybody discards his varna, the malorganization of society grows, chaos reigns and society perishes. If the Brahmin class abjures its work of imparting education, it falls from its pedestal. If a Kshatriya gives up his work of protecting the people, he dishonours his varna. If a Vaishya discards the earning of money, he falls from his varna. If a Shudra abandons
 
 serving, he falls. All stay in their places by remaining engrossed in their own duty. He falls who gives up his proper duty. A Shudra who does his appropriate duty is better than a Brahmin who discards his duty.
 This system of varnas left no scope for privileges. It was merely a duty, an obligation. There is no room at all for feeling of high and low where it is a question of an obligation.
 Today we see the disappearance of the varnadharma. If one varna discards its own duty, the whole varna system declines. Today the Brahmin has discarded the attributes of a Brahmin the Kshatriyas his fighting qualities and the Vaishya his Vaishya character. Some may ask: “Since all are engaged in earning money, what is wrong if one considers that the qualities of a Vaishya still persist?” However, it isnot correct to say so. The Vaishyas of today earn wealth only for themselves, hence they would be regarded as thieves in the language of the Gita. It is the Vaishya’s dharma to earn money and, taking out of it only as much as is needed for his livelihood, to utilize the remainder for the benefit of society. One rarely comes across a person who observes such Vaishya dharma. Hence even Vaishya dharma has perished.
 Now there remains Shudra dharma. How many Shudras are  there who observe it? Labour involuntarily rendered is not service. There is no place for coercion in dharma. It is only labour regarded as sheer duty and rendered voluntarily for the betterment of society that can be called service. Hence we have regretfully to admit that varnadharma has been totally destroyed. By defining a Shudra as a labourer, the commentator has insulted him and has harmed  Hinduism.
 Nevertheless, varnadharma has come to pervade the very being of the Hindu. He may well have connected it, through lack of under- standing, with inter-dining and intermarrying and with untouchability. A Hindu cannot be at peace with himself without a concept of varnadharma. Therefore its revival is possible. Without penance reli- gious awakening or revival is improbable. Penance is the only great force whereby religion can be safeguarded and established. Penance without knowledge is no penance but merely self-torture. A blending of penance and knowledge is possible in Brahmin dharma alone. He alone who strives to acquire knowledge of the Brahman is fit to be a Brahmin. If such an endeavour is made today, Hinduism, that is to say, varnadharma, will be revived some day. Fortunately, there is a small class engaged in it today. Hence I have an unshakable faith that Hinduism—pure sanatana dharma—will once again reveal its lustre
 and point out to the world the way to its good.
 My Hindu religion is all-embracing. It does not advocate antipathy towards other beliefs. Religions have been interwoven. One sees a special quality in every one of them. But no one religion is higher than another. All are complementary to one another. Since this is my belief, the speciality of any religion cannot run counter to another, cannot be at variance with universally accepted principles. Examining varnadharma from that point of view, its interpretation can only be what I have put forward. Moreover, history indicates that followers of Hinduism at one time voluntarily observed it.
 In order to make observance of this varnadharma possible again, all must voluntarily accept Shudra dharma. The Shudras render service mainly through manual labour. This dharma is feasible for all. That is why it is possible-for everyone to follow it. Moreover there has been a feeling of contempt for the Shudras. If everyone regarded himself as a Shudra, religion would be well rid of this concept of high and low.
 Someone may say, ‘If everyone regards himself as a Shudra, why not as a Harijan?’ I would definitely not oppose such insistence, but since there are not five varnas in Hinduism and since untouchability is on the wane, I use the word ‘Shudra’. After the pledgelibtech_125_footnotelibtech_126_footnoteabout  Hindu  awakening  was  taken  in  Bombay   under   the presidentship of Malaviyaji, there is no room for untouchability in Hinduism. Hence at the time of revival of varnadharma, the talk of regarding all as Harijans will be considered out of place. If Harijans and all others stay as Shudras, all will easily be men of God.
 But if, with full understanding, all begin to observe the dharma of service and to regard themselves as Shudras, it will certainly not imply that none will learn  brahmavidyalibtech_127_footnotelibtech_128_footnote. Some people will learn and teach it according to their desire and ability. Some will look after the people, some will earn money. The standard of living of all will be about the same. The condition where one is a millionaire and the others beggars will not subsist. The wealth of the Vaishyas will be regarded as the wealth of the people. All these three forces will be utilized merely for social service. All will be regarded as Shudras only, so that there will be no feeling of high and low. All this will automatically promote the revival of varnadharma.
 
 There certainly is room in varnadharma for tradition. Without that there cannot be proper order; therefore, the progeny of those who impart knowledge will observe the same vocation. All cannot all of a sudden become brahmajnanislibtech_129_footnote. There is no objection if they do. And, to become a brahmajnani is to reach the ultimate in service. There is not even a trace of pride or selfishness at all. And if there emerge many such brahmajnanis, then the varna system can once again be rehabilitated.
Now a few words about inter-dining and intermarriages.
 For those who have correctly understood the foregoing portion, there is no need to write more. No one is obliged to eat in  the  company of a particular person nor obliged to give his daughter in marriage to anybody in particular. Therefore, all will naturally follow their own practice and traditions in respect of giving their daughters in marriage and inter-dining. I have now thought of only one varna, and the Harijan is not excluded from it, so it will suffice to say that all will seek alliances according to their convenience and live and move and eat where their soul finds satisfaction. After untouchability has ended, there is no need to say more on this subject.
 In the end, I shall repeat what I have said many times before. This question of varna system has no direct concern with the removal of untouchability. The abolition of untouchability is the highest duty of every Hindu. The Harijan Seva Sangh exists for that purpose. It has its sphere defined and I have played the chief role in making it do so.
 The ideas about varnadharma at present are my own. Even he who does not subscribe to them should not shirk from working for the abolition of untouchability. None need fight shy of it  because  I happen to be the major participant in it. If the Hindu community does not accept my ideas concerning the system of varnas, they will remain mine alone. I cannot force those on others, nor have I the desire to do so. If those ideas are contrary to Hindu religion I will be thrown out of the Hindu community like an unwanted grainlibtech_130_footnotelibtech_131_footnote. Observance of the dharma to banish untouchability is certainly the common duty of all Hindus. I do not wish to hide a single idea of mine and thereby deceive anyone. The question of varna system has indirect relation- ship with untouchability, hence it is understandable that my associates and others wish to know my ideas about it. That is why I have to develop those ideas. But there is not the slightest reason for anyone to feel confused because of them. Individuals do not matter at all where
 
 the question of religion is concerned. These will come and go. Religion is eternal, it will go on. There have been many ideas about it, and there will be many more. Just as God’s attributes are endless, the frontiers of religion are unending. No one has understood it thoroughly. All should follow it to the extent they understand it, so that the chariot of religion will keep moving forward. Knowing this, and leaving me out of account, all should do research in religion for their own sakes. The conditions of doing that research are well known. He who will observe these conditions will alone know religion to some extent. There are certain rules for getting knowledge of all type. They call for effort. Religious research requires the utmost  effort. Therefore, at the very outset of that research, those with experience have suggested the observance of yamaniyamas.libtech_132_footnote

  	I have your two nice letters before me. Of course you did a lot of 	body labour in the Mission as do many. That was not my point. My 	point was doing just as systematic body labour as the inmates and 	mastering the different crafts. But let me not labour this point. 	Body labour for bread and therefore bread labour is the ideal we are 	trying to reach at the Ashram. But you are to do just what and as 	you like. I do not want you to work under tension. I would be deeply 	grieved if I found you had worked under tension in order to fulfill 	the Ashram routine. I want you to catch the spirit of the Ashram. 	There should be a feeling of satisfaction and joy at the end of 	every period. And that. comes if every minute is dedicated to God 	and every activity done for Him and His. No more time to say more 	today. Love 	from us all.  BAPU  From 	a photostat: G.N. 6000. Also C.W. 3325. Courtesy: F. Mary Barr

        MY 	DEAR BROTHER KESHAV,    March 	19, 1933 "
118,"March 	19, 1933",LETTER TO AMRITLAL V. THAKKAR,"
  	I  am  now  able  to  give  you  my  opinion  about  your   scheme.libtech_133_footnoteKakasaheb is of opinion that you do not need any  	pretentious building just now. The brother who went to Sabarmati has 	not gained much experience. You have already two looms. They should 	be worked for the time being. You are not manufacturing enough yarn 	even to feed those two looms. You should therefore go slowly but 	steadily and extend only when you have a nucleus of trained spinners 	and trained weavers having perfect control over their work and are 	able to produce what may be called marketable yarn and khadi. If you 	do not do this, you will share the fate of several organizations 	that I know have started with a high purpose and a noble motive but 	for want of efficiency and application have died out. This is an 	industry which requires just as much scientific skill, application 	and time as any other. Indeed this requires a little more, but 	certainly not less.  	I would therefore ask you to withdraw this public appeal and develop 	the work silently and unostentatiously, and when you have done that, 	you will find that you have money waiting for you for extension.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 20626         March 	19, 1933  MY 	DEAR THAKKAR BAPA, This 	is in reply to your letter of the 13th instant No. 921.  	I am afraid I cannot take shelter under the easy solution you have 	suggested for my discharge from your complaint. I did mean what I 	said when I dictated the sentence, “I wonder if you read the 	English Harijan.” libtech_134_footnoteI know the kind of worker you are, and ordinarily  I 	should certainly not expect you to read the papers and magazines 	that   may   be   issued   on   behalf   of   the   Societylibtech_135_footnotelibtech_136_footnote.   It   would   be   an impossible task for any 	secretary to undertake. As it is, we have not      
 many newspapers, magazines and literature published under the auspices of the Society. But even what is being published you cannot be expected to read, and if you attempted, you could only do so at the sacrifice of much more valuable work. But I wanted to single out the English Harijan and the Hindi Harijan, the English, because I write down all my thoughts in that paper, and they are as much addressed to you as to other Harijan servants, and that I do, because I am supposed to be guiding and shaping the policy of the Society; therefore it was that by politely asking the question I suggested that you should make an exception in favour of the English Harijan and make time to read it; the Hindi edition you have to read, because it is being published under your very nose, and because the latest matter can be supplied to the Hindi Harijan, but it cannot be to the English because of the distance. The Hindi Harijan has to be packed with facts and figures which I would have to copy from it and which I would love to do. You will be speaking to the innumerable workers and giving them precise instructions through that paper, or else it has no reason for existence. The Hindi Harijan need not contain essays. It should simply contain a translation of my messages and first-class authentic information from the Central Office, as also definite weekly instructions to workers. Then and then only will it justify its existence.
 Now, as to the other part of your letter. I have told you already what view I take of the other organizations. We have to treat them as if they were our own, not in order to dictate, but in order to serve them and in order to harness their services, if they will give them to us. But you know best whether to approach them and how, if at all. Of course, I had and could have nothing against Lala Mohanlallibtech_137_footnotelibtech_138_footnote. Your and my business, however, is, as I conceive it, to investigate all complaints, good, bad and indifferent, so that we leave no loopholes for mistakes or complaints so far as it is humanly possible to do it.
 This brings me to the last part of your letter—Overhead Charges. Both you and I have been lifelong workers and connected with numerous organizations. I really regard myself as an expert economist and organizer in my own way. We shall deserve the curses of posterity, if not also of the present generation, if we do not show that we have put the bulk of our collections into Harijan pockets. 10% overhead charges, therefore, I regard as a liberal estimate. Propaganda we must have, and plenty of it, both among Harijans and caste men. But we have to make the propaganda practically self-supporting, especially amongst caste men. In my opinion, the best propaganda is constructive work amongst Harijans. It will tell not only upon the
 
 latter but also upon caste men. For the present you may have two collections, one for constructive work, that is, for putting directly into Harijan pockets, and the other for propaganda. As a matter of fact, propaganda work ought to be paid for out of the sale proceeds of our weeklies and the sale of our other literature, so that the moneys we may actually collect otherwise would all find their way into Harijan pockets. Our caste-Hindu workers should therefore be volunteers or receiving just maintenance money, and we should find out every available Harijan worker whom we would pay fairly well. He may not give just now very efficient work; I would not worry, but would teach him to do the work. All this can be done only if we have workers religiously-minded, treating this movement as an essentially religious one and approaching it in the religious spirit. Then you will find that we shall have the least opposition to encounter, and no matter what opposition we encounter, the movement must flourish. If we cannot get sufficient hands to work the movement and to work it in that fashion, I, for one, will not hesitate to say that we should cease to be an organization. Without that organization you had your own great work cut out for you, and I have mine. The organization was set up in the belief that it was needed by the people, as I still believe it is, but the test that I have laid down would be the proof of that need.
 I have given you only an outline of what is passing through my mind. You will share this letter with Sjt. Ghanshyamdas; if you think it worth while, you may come down here to discuss the whole thing, or, if you have caught the spirit of my letter and appreciate it, you need not trouble.
 Lastly, I do not want you to reduce to practice anything of this letter because I have written it. You will only reduce to practice that which commends itself to you, and never otherwise. My duty is done when I have passed on my thoughts to you.
 Yours sincerely,
 From a microfilm: S.N. 20633

 DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS,
 I have your letter. You must have improved your spinning in regard to the count, evenness and the strength of the yarn. Great care, even more than about the count, should be taken about the strength and the evenness. There is bound to be a difference in the count if the cotton or the sliver is bad, but there should be no difference in the
 evenness and the strength. Till you reach the standard when you may be said to pass in regard to these two, it cannot truthfully be said that you have spun.
 Whether one is working in the field or doing some other work, one must feel interested. Anybody who is devoted to duty is interested only in doing his duty and not in doing a particular work. Such a person never wishes to choose his own work. He does with interest whatever falls to his lot because he considers that his dharma.  Anybody who does some work unwillingly is not doing it as dharma. Can anybody force himself to do any work as dharma.

I hope now her anger will disappear. How could I say that I would 	never call on her? I should not even think of taking up such an 	attitude.

  	Your suspicion is baseless. As you frankly criticize other people 	and say about them what you feel, so did Mahadev. I asked him. He 	sensed disrespect for him in your repeatedly emphasizing “For 	Mahatmaji”! He said what he felt. You explained and the matter is 	over. You should learn to endure criticism of you and overcome your 	sensitiveness. Cultivate some sense of humour. We should not weigh 	all the criticism against us with the weight which we use in 	weighing gold; for some of it, we should use the weights with which 	we weigh iron or stones. And in doing so, we should take no account 	of half a maund this way or the other. You don’t look delicate, 	but your heart is very sensitive. Harden it now and make it less 	sensitive. Instead of reasoning with you, I am now going to order 	you. You may then disregard my order if you wish. You are not 	permitted to disregard others’ orders, but you may disregard mine 	as often as you like. Whether your conduct in doing so is rude or 	civil, whether your offence is criminal or civil, we shall decide in 	each case.  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 10330. Also C.W. 6770.

 BHAISHRI PARIKSHITLAL,
 I received your sincere letter. It is from my own point of view that I find the figure you state to be frightening, but if I accept the other opposite standpoint it is the most reasonable. Your duty is that of a soldier. You should follow the standard laid down. It is for Thakkar Bapa and your local or provincial (or whatever they call it) Committee to lay it down. My function is only to point out the direction. You may carry out as many of my suggestions as seem practicable in the circumstances. There is every risk, and even probability, of the result being contrary to what was intended if my advice is followed mechanically. Your first duty, therefore, is to weigh my suggestion in the light of your experience and, if it does not seem sound enough, to set it aside and forget all about it. You may put it before your Committee if you find any worth in it. If the Committee also approves of it, you should take it to Thakkar Bapa and carry it out only if he also approves of it. I will not say more than this here. I am now going to discuss my suggestions in the English and the Gujarati editions of the Harijan. So you will be able to know about them.
I state here two rules for your consideration.
 l. The money needed for propaganda work should be found from such work itself. In other words, it should be self-supporting.
  Constructive 	activity is the 	best propaganda. Money 	invested in 	it will be fully rewarded.

 DEAR MAJOR BHANDARI,
 I have more than once told you about the condition of Sardar Vallabhbhai’s nose. You know also how reluctant he is to talk about it. But we who know it are getting nervous. He suffers terribly whilst the attack lasts. All the remedies that you and Major Mehta suggested have been tried without success. The attacks are becoming more and more frequent and more and more troublesome. The worst attack was witnessed on Saturday last. The discharge from the nose and sneezing continued for more than thirty hours. The eyes were blood red and the nose naturally so. The whole day long he ate nothing, drinking only tea in the morning and having fruit and milk and  boiled vegetable in the evening. He is not able to take his ordinary meals. I do feel that it is time that he was examined by his own specialists. Dr. Deshmukh is his general adviser and I should leave it  to  Dr. Deshmukh to bring such nose specialist as he likes. Dr. Damani has generally attended to his nose but I understand that he is suffering from smallpox and may not be available.
 Will you please send this to the Government for an early decision?
 Yours sincerely,

 Read this letter. I have written to Shantilal that I like the idea. Let the bungalow go. The rest of the land may be kept and huts built on it in which occasional visitors may stay. To what extent this will be practicable, what arrangement can be made for water, whether occa- sional visitors can stay in this way and from where they will buy provisions, all this is for Shantilal and you to consider. May be the idea is impractical.They must have received the letter I  wrote  to Vijapur as you had suggested.

 The little booklet about healthlibtech_168_footnotelibtech_169_footnoteneeds  a  lot  of  improvement. There has been some change in my views about vegetables. Vegetables are inferior to fruit but they are easier to digest than cereals. In our country they are a substitute for fruit. If therefore you cannot get fruit in adequate quantities, you should take in liberal quantities leafy vegetables and gourds. Of starchy vegetables you should take only a little or none at all.
 About salt I have no definite opinion as of now. Naturopaths differ in the matter. I do not consider the opinion of the ordinary doctors reliable. But I am sure of this, that it is necessary for everyone who wants to cultivate self-control to give up salt for five or six
 
 months and afterwards from time to time. There is no reason to suppose that giving up salt altogether will necessarily cause harm. Fruits and vegetables contain salt. And it is always there in water. The quarrel is only about salt as a separate article.

 As to the necessity or advisability of our temples being regularly visited by the middle-class people, it is a different matter.  Much reform in temple-worship has to be undertaken before people will voluntarily desire to visit temples. I think that reform will come but in its own time.

No doubt the less demonstrative you are the 	better and more permanent your work will be.  	Your last paragraph makes bad reading. You say, “Sweeping of 	public roads has become irregular.” That’s wrong. Having started 	the work you should have done it with scientific precision and 	regularity. Your irregular scavenging will produce no effect on the 	public. You saw with what trumpeting the work was inaugurated and I 	read with pleasure that you were thinking of constructing special 	carts or wheelbarrows for removing the refuse. But this can be 	necessary only if you are doing your work thoroughly. Your energy 	will be frittered away if you will jump from work to work without 	doing anything completely. What will happen if after having 	half-finished a table, a cabinet maker began a chair and so on? Will 	you not call it all a waste of effort? That is precisely what 	happens generally to philanthropic undertakings. I would like you to 	guard yourself against that error. If you will do the 	street-cleaning then you must have a map and a programme according 	to the number of volunteers you have, and after you have begun a 	street, you may not leave it till its dwellers have taken up the 	cleaning themselves. In order to impress them with the necessity of 	so doing, you will have to be gentle and patient with them, and your 	cleaning will have to be so thorough as to excite their pleasure and 	admiration, and when that happens you will see that the thing will 	work, but you will have to concentrate your attention wholly     
 upon one single piece till outsiders who are the sole judges are able to say, “It’s well done”.
 I am not able to appreciate your presentation of the football to the Harijan boys. For a country like India a ball that costs Rs. 4 to Rs. 5 is an expensive thing. Harijan boys will have footballs given to them by patrons. Servants have got to exercise the greatest care and  discretion in their service, especially when it is they who have to make the choice.
 Your having shifted to servants’ quarters is undoubtedly a very fine idea, and if you will try to live as simply as the Harijans, consistently with your health, it would be a good thing.

 THE SECRETARY
 THE JATHI NASHINI SABHA CANNANORE
 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. Though you can read your meaning in my writing, I must confess that I am too dense to read my meaning in your writing. You are no doubt satisfied that I do not recognize any distinction between high and low. Are you equally satisfied that everyone should pursue his ancestral occupation so as to conserve national energy, national talent, avoid unequal distribution of wealth and keen competition? If you are, then you will alter the aims and objects of your Sabha, but if you are not prepared to alter the aims and objects in accordance with the idea presented, you might agree with me that your prosecution of your aims and objects is likely to create confusion and suspicion if you tack it on to untouchability. Do you not observe that I do not tack on even reformed varnadharma to untouchability? I have simply stated my position in order to avoid misunderstanding, and, what is more important still, the charge of suppressing my opinion in order to gain adherence for the cause of the abolition of untouchability.
 Yours sincerely,

  	You are a silly girl. Would you feel hurt if I told you that I 	tolerated you because you were a good girl and that I would take no 	interest in you if you were a bad girl? If not, then why should you 	be hurt by what I said? My remarks were prompted only by love. I    
 expressed my love by saying that I tolerated you in spite of your unsettled state because your  intentions were good, but you misunderstood my remark completely. What is one to do to a person who thus displays his or her ego?
 You should know that by learning some work or by studying you may become self-supporting, but you cannot be sure that that will make you good. On the other hand, if you become good, mentally strong, and healthy in body, then your character will be sound and you will become self-supporting also. This does not mean that you should not study further or learn a craft. Do that in the Ashram as much as you can during spare time and be satisfied. Engrave in your heart the golden rule that devotion to duty includes everything else. For the present, only do this much, have full faith in Narandas and follow his advice. Do not look upon your money as your own but regard yourself as a trustee. You should not, therefore, spend it even on buying fruit for me, since I get fruit from the other people. It is the Harijans who need the money most. Keep it for them.

152,"March 	22, 1933",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
         March 	22, 1933  CHI. 	NARANDAS, I 	got your big packet of mail.  	It was a great thing indeed that the [Chamar] children gave up 	buffalo flesh. But there may possibly have been violence behind 	this. If they parted with it through fear, what happened was bad. If 	they so wished they should have been given some compensation for 	giving it up since it was their food. Hence you or some other 	responsible inmate of the Ashram should go and ask them. It would be 	fine if they handed over the flesh of their own accord and could 	give up eating buffalo flesh for ever. If they are not ready to do 	that, we should have patience with them.  	You should find out from them or from Chamars who have connections 	with the Ashram the money value of a carcass. Try and find out from 	them, if you can, what the hide, intestines, bones, etc., would 	fetch if sold separately and how they use these things. 
 If anybody else feels sick as Duncan did, you should immediately apply hot fomentation on the abdomen and give the person a piece of ice or lemon to suck. He may also drink cold water one tea-spoonful at a time. Very often the vomiting stops with these measures. If one had not eaten any poisonous food, there is no cause for alarm at all. An enema also will stop vomiting. You should tell this to all who live in the Ashram.
 Impure attraction had sprung up between . . .libtech_182_footnoteand . . .libtech_183_footnoteThey hid their love for quite a long time. I came to know of it by chance. They used to meet secretly and also write to each other secretly. I have still not been able to fathom what is in their hearts. I do not know how far
 . . .’s passion has carried him. Neither seems to have purified his or her heart of lust. We have a rigid rule, to which no exception is condoned, that all young men and women who live in the Ashram as inmates should regard one another as brothers and sisters. The love of these two had gone beyond that relationship. The men and women living in the Ashram are forbidden to meet each other alone. These two have violated that rule. And they also tried,  successfully,  to deceive the whole Ashram, which means that they have violated our chief vow, that of truth. Thus they have violated three important rules of the Ashram.
 I had boundless trust in . . . . I had thought him to be a brahmachari of the highest purity. I had proudly believed that he would never deceive me at any rate. I had believed . . . to be an innocent and pure-minded girl who could never feel passion. I looked upon her as my first-born daughter. I have been proved wrong in my estimate. Falsehood cannot hide itself from one who scrupulously follows truth, non-violence and brahmacharya. Such a person immediately knows anybody who is lustful and all violence subsides in his presence. I have ceaselessly striven for many years to observe these three vows, but I admit that I have failed in my effort. I do not say this in pride. It is my vow of truth which compels me to make this admission. I should have discovered the true character of . . . and . . . .
 My failure to do so is a sure sign of the imperfection of my spiritual attainment. I see that it is imperfect in regard to all the three requirements. I know my spiritual poverty. Unknown to me, falsehood, violence and passion are lurking in me.
 
 I, therefore, feel as much compassion for . . . and . . . as anger against myself. Personally, I don’t judge them, nor should anybody from among us do so. However, my attitude towards them will appear to have changed from now onwards. In fact, it is they who will have changed. Equality consists in treating a sick person and a healthy person as each deserves. One’s attitude towards both should be inspired by love. In either case, one must consider the good of the other person. My attitude towards these two will be in conformity with this principle. I will treat them as sick persons and nurse them as such. All of us should do that. How we can do so, I shall be able to explain later.
 Everybody should learn from this incident. The boys and the girls should take a warning from it. Any of them who feels passion should confess the fact. They need not be ashamed of it. If I discover  a snake in my bed, I cannot be blamed for it. After I have discovered it, I should remove it. Passion is like a snake in the body. One need not feel ashamed of admitting its presence. On the contrary, it is one’s duty to do so. It is a sin to let the snake remain and feed it. One’s duty is to get rid of it. If any girl or boy wishes to marry, she or he is free to do so, except that the prohibition against a brother and a sister or other near relations marrying ought to be observed. I have often cautioned people that nobody should write or receive private letters. Everybody should hand over to the Secretary his or her letter without sealing it. The Ashram is one family. Truth can have nothing private. Everybody who observes this one rule will save himself or herself from many pitfalls. However, nobody should be forced to observe it. The letters of all adult inmates will continue to be treated as they are treated now.
 This is meant for all. If you would like to suggest any change in this or if you don’t feel inclined to read it out to the people there, you may hold the letter back for some time and let me know what you desire. You had warned me against . . .’slibtech_184_footnotelibtech_185_footnotedisregard of rules and his lethargy, and I had been warned by many against his excessive intimacy with . . .libtech_186_footnotelibtech_187_footnoteBut I did not wake up. Let me see whether I who have been so stupid and obstinate, change now.
 
 
 Even when you send many letters, you put them in an ordinary envelope. By the time it arrives here, it is almost completely torn. Some day some letter will get lost. You should either send in  a stronger cover, or tie the envelope with a string as we do a packet sent by book post but stamp it as an ordinary letter. The risk in adopting the latter course lies in what might happen in the office here. One of the letters may slip out. If you wish to economize, let somebody make strong envelopes in the Ashram itself. Even if he makes only one every day, that will suffice. You must be  receiving  strong  brown paper. Probably some persons will also have khadi which can no longer be used. With these materials, you can easily make cloth-lined envelopes.
 Are there any persons, besides Parashuram, who know Hindi and English well? If there are, send me their names.
   [PS.]  BAPU   Read my 	letter to Dhiru. Discuss the matter with him and let me 
  	know. You will have received the letter which I wrote yesterday. I 	wrote in it about Shanta Panvelkar. I have read . . .’slibtech_188_footnoteletter. I don’t see how we have a duty to let him 	live in the Ashram. The Ashram cannot be turned into a home for 	invalids. He also asks for allowance for the maintenance of his 	parents. We cannot pay it. Explain this to him. If he wishes to get 	admitted to a hospital, he may certainly do so. His mother should do 	some work. He may write to somebody in his town. In any case, I 	don’t think we can keep him.  From 	a microfilm of the Gujarati: M.M.U./I. Also C.W. 8340. Courtesy: 	Narandas Gandhi   "

          MY 	DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS,     March 	23, 1933 
  	I have your letter and the cuttings. Unless you make time for the 	operation I know you will never have the time. This always happens 	with busy people, and, therefore it is necessary to consider matters 	of health as real matters of business. I do not write this as a 	philosophic truth, but as a practical truth which I have enforced in 	my own life and    
 in that of others. I hope, therefore, that you will set apart a month or so for the treatment and make an appointment with the doctors beforehand with the fixed resolution of keeping that appointment.
I note what you say about the work in Calcutta.
About Mr. David’s schemelibtech_189_footnotelibtech_190_footnoteI hope to hear from you further.
 I shall certainly write something in the columns of the English Harijan about the Hindi edition as soon as I find the Hindi to be up to the mark. I have written fully about this to Thakkar Bapa, as also to Viyogi Hari. I need not, therefore, repeat what I have written to them. You will give to it what time it is possible for you to give, and make it brimful of instructions and information so that no workers would care to be without it.
 You suggest that I should send the money due to the Central Board to your firm in Bombay.libtech_191_footnoteHow should I save the commission thereby, unless you have meant that I should send notes through someone going to Bombay? If I do that, it would mean my having to run some risk of the money being lost. I have not that courage.
 As to the denunciation of the Yeravda Pact by the Bengal Council, I have not felt much disturbed and I am not quite certain that counter-propaganda is necessary at the present moment. In no case can the Pact be revised unless all the parties to it agree. It will be time enough to apply our minds to the Bengal opposition when the parties are regularly consulted. I was consulted and I have sent my opinionlibtech_192_footnotelibtech_193_footnote, of which I send you a copy. But you and Satisbabu know much better than I can what to do in Bengal.

 March 23, 1933
 DEAR SATISBABU,
 I have your letter of 12th instant. In my opinion, according to the Pact, in the heading ‘untouchable’ can only be included those
 
 whose touch pollutes and who labour under the disabilities incidental to untouchability, but if the Pact can be otherwise interpreted and all those who are considered and are depressed, including the so-called backward classes [are covered], I should be delighted. I should be also delighted if it were open under the Pact to anybody to be classed as untouchable. But I see serious difficulties in the way. The inclusion of any but birth-untouchables might be resented by the latter on the ground that they would then be entitled to stand for Parliamentary elections and thus deprive birth-Harijans of the certainty that they have of election today, and they will be right in their contention, and in the present demoralizing atmosphere I do not see any chance of reason and charity having full play or any play.
 This explains my opinion and my fears. I do not however ventilate my opinion just now in public, because it is irrelevant and unseasonable. When the time comes, I shall not hesitate to express it.
 Yours sincerely,

 TO
 THE HOME SECRETARY TO
 THE GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY
 
 DEAR SIR,
 I have just had the Government’s reply to my letter of the 18th instant.libtech_195_footnotelibtech_196_footnoteI fear that the reply raises a vital issue which I thought the Government had decided once for all in 1922libtech_197_footnotelibtech_198_footnote. The very principle that the Government have now communicated was departed from in that year. Then too it was a question of fasting by the fellow prisoners. Major Jones was then the Superintendent. When the fasting became known to me, I sought an interview with the prisoners so that I could advise them. Major Jones would not listen to my proposal. I had to approach H.E. the then Governor, and I was permitted to see the prisoners with the happiest of results.libtech_199_footnotelibtech_200_footnoteExactly the same question arose in 1930 when I was incarcerated for the second time.libtech_201_footnoteMajor Martin was the Superintendent and he would not listen to my request to see a fasting prisoner. There was correspondence with Government in which I suggested that I was humanitarian above everything else and that I could not exist without being able to make use of my influence as such, wherever it was possible to do so. Here there was not the slightest intention of disturbing the prison discipline and at last my contention was allowed by Government and I was permitted to see prisoners every week, so as to understand their position, and wherever necessary offer helpful suggestions. So far as I am aware Major Martin never had any occasion to deplore the Government’s decision to allow  me  the liberty. That liberty has been continued during this incarceration, with restriction as to the number of prisoners I may see during any single fortnight. And I am not aware of any inconvenience having been thereby caused to Major Bhandari. The Superintendents under whom
 
 I have been a prisoner and the Inspector-General of Prisons  will perhaps testify that my intervention, wherever it was found necessary, has been helpful.
 My present request has no connection whatsoever with special orders passed by the Government of India regarding matters arising out of untouchability. I would request Government not to disturb a decision they arrived at as long as 1922, which was after full deliberation confirmed in 1930, and which has been carried out during the present incarceration. I venture to suggest that no new circumstance has arisen for the revision of that decision. I have raised no new point. Indeed I was painfully surprised when my telegram about the reported fast of Seth Poonamchand Ranka was stopped. I therefore renew my request that the telegram to Bajajlibtech_202_footnotelibtech_203_footnote(Wardha) may be sent without delay and that the decisions of 1922 and 1930 that I have referred to may be confirmed so as to set my mind at ease.

159,"March 	23, 1933",LETTER TO V. D. HULYALKAR,"
         DEAR 	FRIEND,       March 	23, 1933 
  	I have your letter. To all the preaching that you are doing I should 	add some tangible work, say, teaching Harijan children. I take it 	that you diligently read the weekly Harijan. Now 	about your questions.   The 		Devadasi question 		is very 		little, but by 		the purity 		of your 		own life 		and perseverance 		you will 		be able 		to reduce 		the evil. 		The only 		effective argument I 		can suggest 		is that 		Harijans should 		realize that 		there can be 		no religion in 		reserving one 		daughter as 		Devadasi, 		for the simple 		reason that the 		millions of 		other Hindus do 		not do 		so and 		regard such 		reservation as 		impure. Those who 		have already given 		themselves up 		to an immoral life will 		only leave it when 		a sense 		of shame is created in Harijan circles. It will not do for you to become     
 panicky.
  The 	game of 	mud and water 	will be given 	up if you 	will carry 	on your propaganda 	in perfect 	gentleness and 	if you 	have endeared yourself 	to Harijans 	by constructive service.  If 	Harijans can 	become vegetarians, 	nothing can be better; 	but if they will not, they should at least give up carrion and beef.  Of 	course it 	is difficult for 	you to find 	them in their 	homes during the 	day-time. Certainly, 	therefore, visit them at 	night or 	early in 	the day, 	but they 	will not be 	in the mood 	to listen 	to you 	early in 	the morning.  By 	constantly defending the 	Harijans against insults 	they will themselves 	learn to resent insults.  All 	things considered, a 	well-chosen vegetarian 	diet with the 	addition of 	pure milk is 	undoubtedly better than 	a mixed 	diet of 	meat and vegetables.  Smoking 	surely is 	not necessary 	in order 	to secure 	rest. Wherever 	organized labour is 	working, employers of 	labour should be 	induced to give rest at fixed intervals to all, smokers and non-smokers.  I 	am afraid 	that the argument 	that field labour 	is more 	paying than 	a peonship 	requiring a knowledge 	of the 	three R’s 	is true  and 	therefore Harijan 	parents will 	not be 	easily induced to 	send their 	children to 	schools without being 	shown that it will 	be more 	profitable in 	the end.  There 	is no question 	of first 	and last; 	the awakening 	should be 	general, both amongst 	the Harijans 	and the caste 	men.  Truth 	and non-violence 	must always succeed. 	Tit-for-tat is the 	law of the beast, not 	of man.  I 	have no 	doubt that 	the present Harijan 	movement will 	purify Hinduism all 	round and 	will succeed in 	preventing disturbances 	or disruption.  Everybody 	is authorized 	to ask 	Harijan servants all 	kinds of 	questions, much 	more so 	their parents, 	therefore such questions should be 	patiently and 	courteously answered.  If 	your silence 	and fast on 	Mondays is 	a matter 	of vow, 	you cannot break it on any account unless you have left any loophole.

  	You can never tire my patience, for I value the interest you are 	taking in everything I say or write or do. I know also that you do 	not argue in any spirit of controversy. I see your difficulty. You 	take or seem to take only one view of things. I have a profound 	faith in the Jain doctrine of Anekantvad. It is the manysidedness as 	opposed to one-sidedness. To illustrate this celebrated doctrine we 	have a well-known story of ‘the elephant and seven blind men’, 	all of whom described the same creature in seven different ways, and 	the poet ends by saying ‘they were all true and they were all 	false’, and we may add ‘God alone is true, no one and nothing 	else is or can be wholly true.’  	Holding this view I can appreciate and defend your attitude, but I 	can also defend my own. If the world will be influenced by my 	attitude on the question of temple-entry, not in its own way but in 	my way, I have no fear about its moral safety.

 SUJNA BHAISHRI,
 I hope you remember the draft [Bill] approved by you, which Sarupbehn, that is, Vijayalakshmibehn, has shown to me. May I publish it? I will do so if you permit me. It seems to be good. It pertains to throwing open to Harijans one of the State-owned temples. In a subsequent letter you say that the idea has been dropped, as there is a danger of its leading to something like a referendum and that, in that case, the caste Hindus might stop going to the temple. The result thus might be the opposite of what is desired. May I express my view? Why should we fear the consequence of doing what is right? Let other caste Hindus not go to that temple; at any rate you and Ramabehn, the Maharaja, Ranisaheba, etc., will go. And I am sure a few other individual reformers also will go to it. It will be good if the Harijans are allowed the use of even one temple. If the reason you have given is the only one, I would request you to throw open one very popular temple even at a great risk. It seems from your letter that in Bhavnagar itself there are about four temples under State control. Even the sanatanists should not object to the Harijans being permitted to go to one of them. I hope you got my previous letter.

I have even made an earnest appeal to Pattaniji to throw open one temple at Bhavnagar. We should get as many temples opened at as many places as we can. It will of course be excellent if some people build new temples which are open to all and if sanatanists also help in doing so.
 You write nothing about your health. You ought to write some- thing.I follow what you say regarding the elders. Who can explain to them that they should now live on fruit juice, that that will keep their bodies free from impurities and their minds calm and that they do not require any other food for energy? This is, however, not for them, but only for you, so that you should know from now what you should do when you become old. If God puts me in a similar condition and I am not willing to stop eating altogether, may He grant that I wish and have the strength to live only on fruit juice. I have no doubt that when most of the organs of the body begin to fail, air and water are the only food. All this, however, is in the lap of the future.
I am returning your draft herewith.

          MY 	DEAR N.,       March 	23/24, 1933 
  	I had your two letters. I like them. The poetic touch about one of 	them was quite in its place.libtech_214_footnoteI hope you got my telegramlibtech_215_footnotelibtech_216_footnotewhich 	I sent immediately I finished reading your letters approving of the 	idea of going to a village and living amongst its Harijans. If it is 	well thought out, it is an excellent plan. But there should be no 	hurry or hysteria about a single step which you may now take. Until 	Truth has become natural to you, life will certainly appear hard and 	you will experience what may appear to be disappointments. There is 	no such thing as disappointment when one is filled with Truth. It 	then simply shines through one and lights the whole life.  	You must tell me more about Rudramani. There should be no guide for 	you but God, the Truth. I do not want you to be under any more 	spells. You may be thankful for such service as is rendered to you 	and is legitimate for you to accept, and mostly it can only be the 	food that you may need and the other necessaries of life. A servant 	has no further wants, and especially a servant of Harijans.  I  can 	imagine nothing nobler or more inspiring than this service. It 	carries with it complete satisfaction.  	You will find a note for S.libtech_217_footnotewith this. It was good that you made him write those 	few lines, and it was good that you used the balance of the money 	left in the way you have described. The description made my eyes 	wet. 
   [PS.]  Yours sincerely,   I have 	your very good letter today. The foregoing was dictated 
 yesterday. 	May Truth surround you and fill you.    From 	a microfilm: S.N. 20689    BAPU

March 24, 1933
 Your 	letter came in yesterday. It is now 3.15 morning.  	I am glad you are free from constipation. You won’t feel the heat 	at all if you will continuously keep the wet cloth on the head. It 	cools the whole system. I do not know how they bring your milk. If 	it is strained as soon as it is milked or if it is bottled 	immediately and well corked and wrapped in a wet cloth, it should 	keep for many hours and drunk cold and unfired. I have given up 	fired milk altogether without any ill consequence. I get all the 	vitamins and perhaps only one pound that I take gives me more 	strength than more of boiled milk will. I am still on milk and 	paupau and oranges and dates. Oranges I take only once. This appears 	to be quite enough, perhaps more than enough. But what I want to 	tell you is that if you can manage unfired milk you will suffer less 	from the heat. The milk must be kept in as airtight a bottle as 	possible and the latter put in a wet cloth. The wet cloth keeps it 	ice-cold. You may strain it through a cloth before you. The cloth 	should be washed well immediately after use and so should the 	bottle. If that is done, I should feel quite at ease even though you 	may take your milk unfired. I think I have made my instructions 	quite clear. If you do not like the change and  are  otherwise 	feeling quite well, you need not make the change.  	My weight stands at 104 lb. I do wonder. Though I try to live 	without   attachmentlibtech_218_footnotelibtech_219_footnote,  I   have   no   doubt   that   there   are   things  	 that unconsciously affect me. You know my great regard for     libtech_220_footnote. He has  	been my greatest brahmachari in the Ashram and the most 	truthful boy. You have also known what might even be called my 	partiality for  	. . .libtech_221_footnotelibtech_222_footnote. Well, both have been found making love to one another 	and trading on my faith in them. They have even been contemplating 	marriage. . . .’slibtech_223_footnotelibtech_224_footnoteletters have come into my hands. I had hopes  of making 	      a proper Harijan girl. But now I do not know what will happen 	to . . . and	I am making an effort to patch up the broken  	vessels. But I do not know how far I shall succeed or how far they 	will       
 help. But all this is the language not of detachment but of attachment.  I know the language of detachment, I am not practising the art. Hence it would be untruthful to use the language. I cannot dismiss these two lightly from my mind. I hope to do so in time. The immediate work in front of me does not permit me to brood over their sin. But because  I have written to you, I see quite clearly how I stand myself. You are not going to worry over this. I am quite all right in spite of the tempest. God keeps me. I have laid bare the struggle going on within. But it is momentary. Truth will stand even if the Ashram is reduced to ashes and all my idols are broken to pieces. . .libtech_225_footnotelibtech_226_footnotehas been grand. And who knows that this discovery will not lead to a greater cleansing all round. Therefore you are not to grieve but to rejoice. Here at 4.15 the prayer began. This is after prayer and hot water and honey 4.45. Princess Aristarchi continues to send her weekly letters full of love for Harijan. She is fasting and praying and saving for the cause. If you will like to have more of the cards she has been sending, I would gladly send them. She sends you her love and so does Madeleine Rolland.  The Rishilibtech_227_footnotelibtech_228_footnoteseems to be keeping fair in spite of the rigours of the winter and the collapse of order and democracy in Germany, They of course send their love to you. And for that matter all who write from Europe. But you know how indifferent I am about sending you these messages. Tell Ba I may not write to her every week.

It was impossible that with all the 	earnestness and force you could put into your words you could fail 	to be effective.  	The Cross undoubtedly makes a universal appeal the moment you give 	it a universal meaning in place of the narrow one that is often 	heard at ordinary meetings.

You 	must tell me more of her when you have known her more.  	I never knew that people out there ever carried loads on their 	heads. Is what you saw the usual practice in your part of England? 	What could be the weight, and what are the receptacles made of in 	which the load is carried ? What is the distance that is covered? Is 	it the ordinary house-refuse that they contain ? I 	hope Hanslibtech_233_footnotelibtech_234_footnotehas found an answer to his prayer.  	Maria wrote to me the other day and I saw how glad she was that you 	were at last coming.

 MY DEAR MARGARETE,
 Your letters continue to come with clock-work regularity. Of course you are not going to be upset if you are turned out as a Jewess.  I shall be now eagerly waiting for your letters to know your fate.
 If you will have it so, you can take the palm for economy, though you must remember the old proverb that “One swallow does not make a summer”, and for that reason your summary dismissal of the question of food does not mean that the solution is as easy as you fancy it is for you. Whilst it need not be given undue importance, it is  a gross error to think that food has nothing to do with a person’s moral or even physical growth. The experience of the sages of the world shows that they have given importance, some more and some less, to it, and the majority have admitted that a bloodless diet is necessary for full spiritual enlightenment.
 You need not worry over the poor comprehension that your girls have shown of ahimsa.libtech_237_footnoteI do not wonder. There is no response to ahimsa from the atmosphere. They have never been taught to attach the slightest value to it, and probably they have been taught to despise it. You can not expect them all of a sudden to understand the value of ahimsa in an atmosphere so hostile as yours.
 Mahadev has been receiving your letters and he has got your booklet too. As I have heard of Parsifal and as it was quite a booklet I read it during odd moments in two days and I liked it very much.
Yes, Mr. Kodanda Rao also got your letter.

 BHAI HARIBHAU,
 I have just read your article about ahimsa. Your ideas are good as far as they go. But the article is not worth printing. You should go still deeper into the subject. Ahimsa does not seem to me to be a simple thing to write about. Instead of trying to write an article about it, it would be better to describe the thoughts which arise and the difficulties which are experienced while putting the principle into practice. Your statement that as an ethical principle ahimsa is universally accepted is also not true, though to a certain extent it is so accepted. Many people regard it as dharma to kill deadly animals or creatures. Others regard the killing of sinful men as dharma.
 Of course there would be nothing wrong in your frequently writing such articles in order to clarify your own thoughts to yourself.
How are you now?
I am returning the article.

 Why does Ramibehnlibtech_238_footnotecarry a burden   on  her  mind?  Has  she forgotten her study of Sanskrit and the Gita?
 Do not spoil Mahavir and Krishnamaiyadevi. The latter must do some work. And Mahavir should keep an account of every pie. Do not let him become a beggar. He must make some return. He will be happier if he learns to face difficulties. He should not use the name of the Ashram anywhere. By all means give him whatever help you can
 
 in finding a job.
 We cannot meet, but you may write to me and ask any question which you may wish to.
 For what was Mirabehn criticizing Ba? The latter is full of faults, no doubt, but her devotion is immeasurable. There can be no doubt that Ba is covering herself with glory. Her faults are overshadowed by her firmness of mind.

180,,NOTES,"
  
 
 WILL NOT TEMPLES BE DESERTED?
An M.A.,LL.B. enquires:
 If temple-entry is allowed to Harijans, it is highly likely that the caste Hindus and the priests will desert them. In that event, of what avail would the right of temple-entry be?
My only answer to this question should be that the corresp-
 ondent evidently does not follow the movement but has simply condemned it, as his question implies and as I know from his long letter from which I have taken the question. But such an answer will not be sufficient for the cause.
 Let the correspondent and those who think like him understand that the contingency that they contemplate can never happen, because the movement is not designed to force entry into any single temple, whether by law or otherwise. The assistance of the Legislature is being sought in order to make it possible to throw open temples where public opinion is ripe. It is impossible today even where  public opinion unanimously desires it. When, therefore, caste Hindus, as also the priests, desire the entry of Harijans into particular temples side by side with them, there can be no question whatsoever of the temples being deserted. When the temple-entry of Harijans is permitted under
 these voluntary conditions, the temples would be all the purer for their admission, as is the case with numerous private temples which have been opened and which have not been deserted either by the priests or the caste Hindus.
 
WOMEN WORKERS IN CUTTACK
 
 Shrimati Rama  Devilibtech_239_footnoteof  Cuttack  sends  me  a  letter  in  Hindi, giving an account of the work being done by the women of Cuttack amongst Harijans. I give a translation of portions of the letter:
 Since October I have been working amongst Harijans, with seven other sisters. We confine our attention to Cuttack only. We are all volunteers, working under the direction of the Anti-untou-chability Board. The only pecuniary assistance we receive is in the shape of books and medicine from the Municipality. The stock of medicine is supplemented by local Kavirajs. We have distributed ourselves in four  bastis  of Bhangis, allotting two workers to each. We give instructions in the three R’s to the girls, teach them bhajans and read to them simple religious books. We distribute medicines amongst the ailing inhabitants, clean their quarters, report their special difficulties to the Committee, and we put before the womenfolk the desirability of refraining from eating beef or carrion. They were afraid of us when we first approached them. They had no faith in what we said to them and would not even listen. Slowly they shed their fear of us and now they do listen to us to some extent. We hope to get other volunteers amongst the women of Cuttack. Some girls have already begun work with us.
 I congratulate these sisters of Cuttack on their devotion to the cause of the much-desired reform. Women are special custodians of all that is pure and religious in life. Conservative by nature, if they are slow to shed superstitious habits, they are also slow to give up all that is pure and noble in life. In this struggle for religious reform, therefore, the women of India may be expected to take a leading part.  I hope, therefore, that the example of the women of Cuttack will prove infectious and that the work begun by Shrimati Rama Devi and her companions will be continued in spite of the difficulties and disappointments that they might have to face.
 
 WHAT  MORE CAN I DO?
A correspondent from the South writes:
 I and my friend bought Khadi worth Rs. 20 and distributed it amongst Harijan brethren. I presided at a meeting advocating removal of untouchability and I am proud to be able to say that my friends are taking steps in the direction. What more can I do?
 This is a curious question. But I have not taken it literally. The writer, I am sure, does not mean to convey that he is fully satisfied with what he has done. But whether he is or not, in my opinion no one can afford, in this big campaign, to be satisfied with giving a little of his substance and occasionally presiding at meetings, assuming, of course, that he or she has much more time at their disposal. When the spirit of reform seizes one, hundreds of things will press upon one’s attention. It is not, however, for me to say what a particular person should do. He must take up the whole programme of the Servants of Untouchables Society and do all those things which it may be possible for him to do, consistently with his other obligations. The programme of the Society is merely illustrative, by no means exhaustive; therefore,  it is open to anyone to supplement it, so as to meet with any peculiar circumstances that may be prevalent in his own locality.

  "
181,,181 . THE MUCH-MALIGNED BRAHMIN,"
 A Bengali Professorlibtech_241_footnotewrites a long letter from which I take the following extracts:
 You will be distressed to learn that the anti-untouchability movement in certain parts of the country has degenerated into a vile and violent propa- ganda against Brahminism and all that it stands for. Misleading half-truths and deliberate untruths are being assiduously circulated in order to lower the Brahmins as a class in the estimation of the general public. Is the practice of untouchability confined exclusively to the Brahmins? Are not the other caste Hindus equally guilty? Even admitting that the Shastras were made by the Brahmins, where is the proof that the Shastras enjoin a rabid type of untouchability as is practised today in certain parts of India?
 Is it not a fact that the Brahmins have made a very substantial contri- bution towards the success of the present anti-untouchability movement? Is it not, again, true that the majority of those of our worthy M.L.A.s who have adopted an obstructionist attitude towards the Temple-entry Bill happen to be other than Brahmins ? Why, then, this tirade against the Brahmins, who perhaps realize more than anybody else the gravity of the situation created by the scourge of untouchability?
Except for the writings in the papers and periodicals repre-
 senting the anti-Brahmin movement which has been going on in the country for some years and which was inaugurated long before the campaign against untouchability was, I have not seen any attack,  violent or otherwise, upon Brahminism. Certainly the Servants of Untouchables Society has had nothing to do with any such attack, and the writer is quite right in saying that I would be distressed if I learnt that the anti-untouchability movement had degenerated into a vile and violent propaganda against Brahminism. I have, therefore, asked the correspondent to furnish me with the evidence that may be in his possession to prove the serious statement he has made. The letter enables me, however, to reiterate my own opinion of Brahminism and Brahmins.
 I believe Brahminism to be unadulterated wisdom leading one to the realization of Brahman, that is God. If I did not hold that view, I should no longer call myself a Hindu. Brahmins, however, like all the
 
 other members of the human family, are not all true representatives of Brahminism. But I have to believe that, of all the classes in the world, the Brahmin will show the largest percentage of those who have given up their all in search of knowledge, that is Truth. I know of no system other than Hinduism under which a class has been set apart from generation to generation for the exclusive pursuit of divine knowledge and consigned to voluntary poverty. That Brahmins could not keep up the high standard that they had imposed upon themselves is no special fault of theirs. Their imperfection merely proves that they were as fallible as the rest of mankind, and so corruption crept into the so-called sacred books, and we have the spectacle of the most selfless rules governing Brahmins side by side with the selfish rules also made by them in order to help their breed. But it was the Brahmins who rose against the corruptions and selfish interpolations into the sacred texts. It was they who time and again strove to purge themselves and society of evil. I confess that I have the highest reverence for Brahminism and  a sneaking regard for Brahmins and that, in spite of what is to me the sorrowful spectacle of Brahmins so-called making a frantic effort against the reform movement and lending their undoubted ability to the opposition, I am consoled, and let every unbiased Hindu be consoled, by the fact that the reform movement, too, is being led by those who are born Brahmins but who today take no pride in their birth. If a census was taken of all the workers against untouchability, I think it will be found that the majority of workers who are devoted to the cause without any remuneration or with only just enough to keep body and soul together are Brahmins. But I admit that Brahmins as a class have suffered degradation. If they had not, if they had lived up to their profession, Hinduism would not be in the degraded state in which it is. It would be a contradiction in terms to suggest that Hinduism is what it is in spite of the correct life of the Brahmins. That could not be, because the Brahmins themselves have taught us to believe that they are the true custodians of the divine wisdom and that, where there is divine wisdom, there is no fear, there is no grinding pauperism, there is no high and low state, there is no greed, jealousy, war, plunder and the like. Because Brahminism went down, it drew down with it all the other classes of Hindus, and I have not a shadow of doubt in my mind that, if Brahminism does not revive, Hinduism must perish, and for me the infallible test of  the  revival  of Brahminism, that is, Hinduism, is the root-and-branch removal of untouchability. The more I study the Hindu scriptures and the more I
 discuss them with all kinds of Brahmins, the more I feel convinced that untouchability is the greatest blot upon Hinduism. This conviction is amply supported by many learned Brahmins who have no axes to grind, who are devoted to the pursuit of truth and who receive nothing, not even thanks for their opinion. But today  Brahmins and Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras are  mere  labels. There is utter confusion of varna as I understand it and as I have explained it in these columns, and I wish that all the Hindus will voluntarily call themselves Shudras. That is the only way to demonstrate the truth of Brahminism and to revive varnadharma in its true state. Because all Hindus may be classed as Shudras, wisdom and power and wealth will not disappear, but they will be all used for the service of not a sectional religion but the service of Truth and humanity. Anyway, in battling against untouchability and  in  dedicating myself to that battle, I have no less an ambition than to see  a complete regeneration of humanity. It may be a mere dream, as unreal as the silver in the sea-shell. It is not so to me while the dream lasts, and in the words of Romain Rolland, ‘‘Victory lies not in realization of the goal but in a relentless pursuit after it.”

182,,182. IDEAL HARIJAN TEACHER,"
 The question is being asked as to what I expect of a teacher  of Harijans. I admit that my test is exacting, but it will  be  found  also that it is none too exacting for a willing worker. Moreover, my test is the only real test, if it is granted that this movement has a purely religious motive behind it. I may also add that I tried the experiment with complete success, while it lasted, in Champaran years ago.libtech_242_footnotelibtech_243_footnoteIt  could  not  be  continued,  because  my   stay   in   Champaran proved to be brief, and the volunteers who had offered their services had undertaken merely to give a start, the idea being to raise local teachers of the type contemplated.
Let me briefly describe the teachers and the experiment.
 The teachers were Avantikabai Gokhale, Anandibai Vaisham- payan, Kasturbai Gandhi, Manibehn Parikh, Dharanidharbabu, Nara- hari Parikh, Babasaheb Soman, Chhotelal Jain and Devdas Gandhi.
 
 These were all, of course, responsible men and women, some of them pleaders and graduates. None of them were trained teachers. The majority had no knowledge of Hindi except that they could,  with more or less difficulty, make themselves understood. Kasturbai Gandhi was illiterate but was in no way behindhand to other teachers. These were spread out in four or five villages. I forget the exact number for the moment. They were to start with the children but finish with the men and women. A knowledge of the three R’s was only one of the items. They had to look after their health and their character. They were not to use corporal punishment on any account whatsoever. Work was to be like play. The children—boys and girls— were on no account to be tired out. The first business of the teacher was to examine the appearance of each boy and girl—their eyes, ears, teeth, hair, nails, etc., and clean them, wherever necessary, and teach the boys to keep themselves clean, to see to it that  the  children behaved properly towards one another and that they did not use foul language.
 Let me say in parenthesis that the non-Hindi teachers learnt their Hindi from the children. They were otherwise so raw that the teachers could merely see that the children traced the alphabet correctly and count the numerals in proper sequence. The central fact was to create round the school an atmosphere of culture.
 The teachers were given no domestic servants. They had to do their own cooking, washing, etc. Where there were no buildings, they were to help building bamboo huts. In every case, clean, open spaces and, in my opinion, the simple art of the rustic were insisted upon. Paraffin tin shanties or dungheap surroundings were religiously shun- ned. In one instance we were able to secure the site of a temple. In every case the school became the pride of the villagers and a centre of culture.
 But it had also to radiate its direct influence upon the grownup men and women. They received medical aid and therethrough also object-lessons in cleanliness, etc. The teachers’ living quarters, which were adjacent to the school, or where both house and  school combined, were to be the dispensary of the village and contained stock of quinine, an opening medicine, and an  ointment  with dressings. They were to confine their attention to constipation, malaria and simple ulcers. The dispensaries were organized under the late lamented Dr. Dev of the Servants of India Society who personally
 
 supervised this department of relief and attended to all serious cases. He penetrated the homes of the villagers and transformed little Bhitiharva in a few weeks’ time from a dung-and-mud-sodden village into a clean-looking cluster of hamlets with the willing assistance of the villagers, and if I remember rightly, without the cost of a single pice. Dr. Dev was not a mere overseer of works. He was himself the leading labourer working with the spade and the shovel.
 What Dr. Dev himself did in Bhitiharva the teachers did with more or less success in the other villages. The village roads and wells were cleaned. Inroads were made into the huts with the willing consent of the dwellers. Their little yards were cleaned for them in the first instance. The teachers had to become one with the villagers, share their troubles and sorrows and point to them the way to health and happiness in that malaria-and-superstition-ridden, unknown part of India, once the land of Janak and Sita. It was in remote Bhitiharva that Kasturbai made the discovery that several women had no wardrobe but the one ragged sari on their persons. When one of the poor but dignified ladies was gently advised to bathe daily, she hotly replied,” Come into my room, see if I have a change of sari and then give me your advice. You don’t expect a lady to bathe naked, do you?” There was nothing more to be said. When I heard the tragic story, I could but drop a silent tear in shame and sorrow.
 I need hardly carry the description any further. The would-be teacher of Harijans can easily fill in the details.
 That was my very first experiment in village schools, as it was my first living experience of Indian villages. Fifteen years have rolled by since. My experience has widened considerably.  During  these years I have seen hundreds of villages. I fancy I understand their wants much better than I did in 1917. To my ideal school for Harijans, therefore, I would add handicrafts, and most certainly begin with spinning and other cotton processes. I would add night schools for both the grown-ups and the children. I would entertain no high hopes of success. I would not even attempt to carry things by storm. I would, on the other hand, approach my work in due humility and infinite faith in my mission. I would let the children and the parents dominate me before I dream of dominating them. I would seek to qualify myself as their servant by right of love, in the fullest confidence that in the end I would dominate not them but their hearts.  I have already outlined this scheme before two co-workers, one a High
 Court pleader and the other a very well-educated sister. Each wanted to know how they could take up immediate service. And I gave them each a fair half hour inviting them to be the ideal teacher. I now present the invitation to every servant of Harijan who is in need of work. I offer no pay. But I undertake to find villages for those who cannot. Everyone has to pay his or her own expenses and if he or she is too poor, he or she has to beg enough from his or her friends. The teacher has to live like a Harijan. Therefore, not much expense is needed. The school building will be any verandah or open space that might be offered by the Harijans. ‘‘Where there’s the will there’s the way.”

183,,183. AUNDH STATE AND UNTOUCHABILITY,"
 I had requested Pandit Satavlekar, the well-known Vedic scholar of Aundh, to acquaint me with facts about the anti-untouchability movement in the Auadh State, as I had seen reports about it in the Press. His letter traces the progress of the movement during the last ten years and recounts the difficulties in the way of the reformer. I give below a condensed rendering of his Hindi letters:
 There are 72 villages in the State. The Chief is a Brahmin of advanced views and wants untouchability to go. Ten years ago, he invited the so-called untouchables in the State to fulfil the following three conditions, in order to enable him to declare them on a level with other Hindus and entitled to temple-entry:
 giving 	up of carrion, giving 	up eating 	leavings of food, daily bath. 
 These simple conditions were proclaimed in all the villages. The response was not encouraging. This was in effect the reply received from every one of the villages:
  It 	is impossible for 	us to give 	up carrion 	as we get 	it free. 	We can think 	of giving 	up carrion 	if we are given 	clean meat in lieu 	of it.  We 	would fain 	give up leavings 	of food. 	Give us 	clean food instead. There 	is not 	enough water for 	bathing and washing. 
 
  We 	are indifferent as 	regards temple-entry. 
 The matter was allowed to rest there. Then came Sjt. V. R. Shinde, the great abolitionist, who visited them in their homes and appealed to them to avail themselves of the Chief’s offer. He also asked them to abolish untouchability amongst themselves. This appeal, too, fell on deaf ears.
 After this I started a village sanitation programme. We went out every morning singing prabhat pheris and offering to clean the courtyards and surroundings of houses of which the tenants were indifferent. The results were somewhat encouraging. We offered soap and other washing facilities to those who were doing scavenging. But they said it was too much to expect them to keep clean, when they had to earn their living from an unclean occupation.
 This was followed up by propaganda in the shape of bhajans, kathas, and special fairs. Classes were held to familiarize the Harijans with religious books. Schools with two teachers—an untouchable and a touchable—were started to induce them to learn the three R’s. No grown-ups came forward, but youngsters did come and are  still  coming to these schools.
Here is an account of the present state of things:
 The State schools are open to all, and they are being availed of by Harijan children. Harijans may visit temples after a bath, and they are doing so.
 In October last, a Health Day was held, volunteers were posted in every Harijan quarter and the Chief was good enough to announce prizes to those whose houses and surroundings were found to pass the test of cleanliness. One month’s intensive work before the Day was enough to do the trick. Every street and every Harijan quarter was a model of cleanliness. In fact, some Harijan houses in Aundh looked cleaner than Brahmin houses. His Highness, with  the  Ranisaheba, made a point of visiting every quarter and in Aundh alone, 105 prizes were awarded, half of them being won by the Harijans. The Rani- saheba went into every Harijan house, made inquiries about their appointments and needs, and the Harijan women honoured her with marking with their own hands her forehead with the auspicious kumkum mark.
 This led to a general awakening throughout the State. On October 26th a meeting was held in the Bhawani temple for distri- bution of prizes. It was attended by numerous untouchables.
 Harijans have free access to the palace, and the Ranisaheba and her daughters often attend Harijan weddings. The Chief has allowed a Harijan Chamar to open his shop in a highcaste quarter. On the auspicious Makarsankranti day—14th of January—the Ranisaheba invited Harijan women to the palace and distributed Sankranti gifts to them. A Harijan kathakar gave a discourse in a famous temple and a number of caste Hindus attended it.
 I may, therefore, say that, so far as the State is concerned, there is in Aundh State no recognition of untouchability. But neither the caste Hindus nor the Harijans have reaped the full benefit of this. I shall illustrate what I say. The opponents of reform are more non-Brahmins than Brahmins. Temples visited by the Harijans are boycotted for the most part by non-Brahmins. In my own press there are six Harijan workers. The Mahar among these regards himself as superior to the five Mangs. When they sit down to feed in my house, they decline to sit in the same row.
 In towns untouchability is going, but villages do still seem to be a difficult proposition. In this connection, I must advert to carrion-eating once again. It has led to most unfortunate results. It seems to stand like a dead wall between Harijans and caste Hindus and has often led to quarrels, and it may lead to bloody feuds. The reason is that the Harijans do not scruple to poison cows and buffaloes and bullocks to the consternation of the poor agriculturist, who feel that association with these cow-killers is unthinkable. There were no fewer than 124 cases of cattle-poisoning in the course  of four  months during the last year and special provision had to be made in the Law to prevent such crime.
I would request you to guide us with suggestions for future
work.
This   is  an   instructive   and  truthful  account  of  the campaign
 against untouchability in the Aundh State. Pandit Satavlekar is an old silent reformer of unremitting zeal. He is a great Sanskrit scholar and has dedicated himself to the spread of the mission of the  Vedas. Aundh has a liberal-minded Chief who, with the Ranisaheba, deserves congratulations for abolishing untouchability from his State. Notwithstanding the existence of favourable circumstances, in Aundh, the progress of reform has been slow. For progress is lame and taxes the reformer’s patience. Pandit Satavlekar has asked for suggestions. The work has been so thorough that I can only say, ‘Continue without
 losing faith and success is a certainty.’
 I must confess that I have no anger against the Harijans who poison cattle. We are reaping as we have sown. We dare not neglect a single limb of society without the whole of it suffering. We have wholly misinterpreted the great law of karma and virtually consigned the Harijans to their own fate. We have forced them to labour for us on utterly inadequate remuneration and never cared to know how they have lived and fared. The wonder is that they are not much worse than they have been described.
 I have suggested the only infallible method of weaning them from carrion-eating. All dead cattle should be declared State property and the cattle should be treated under the supervision of reliable officers, and proper remuneration should be given to the Harijans who may be willing to skin the carcasses and dispose of the several parts thereof as they may be directed. Here there can be no quarrel, no cattle-poisoning and no carrion-eating. All the proceeds from the disposal of the skin and other parts of carcasses should be earmarked for the benefit of Harijans, thus freeing the State from suspicion of exploitation.
 For further guidance on this matter, I suggest a careful perusal of my article on “Disposal of Carcasses”libtech_244_footnotein last week’s Harijan.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. For me God and Truth are one, and of all the names by which we know God, Truth has always appeared to me the most appropriate name to know Him by, and for me selfless service is contemplation and meditation, whereas the so-called meditation may be self-indulgence. For me God is formless and therefore my vision of Him does not consist of any form. I think you will realize the Truth of what I am saying if you read the Bhagavad Gita carefully in the light of my remarks and live up to the interpretation I have tried to put before you.
 You can hardly ever get pure, fresh olive oil in India. I am told that there are olive trees in Kashmir and that olive oil is pressed there. I have never seen it. The olive oil one generally gets at the chemists’. It is often a year old, never less than six months, and I have ceased to believe that it can be a substitute for milk. You may therefore dismiss olive oil from your mind considered as an independent food. Fresh sweet oil that we can get abundantly in India is, medical men say, a good substitute for olive oil.
 Yours sincerely,

189,"March 	25, 1933",LETTER TO AMRITLAL V. THAKKAR,"
  	I thank you for your letter of the 14th instant. I entirely agree 	with you that the proper thing is to abolish all distinction between 	touchables and untouchables and know them both by the generic name 	‘Hindu’. But so long as it is necessary to distinguish 	untouchables from touchables, surely it is better that they are 	known by an inoffensive name than by an offensive one. An undutiful 	or unregenerate son might call his mother ‘father’s wife’, but 	a dutiful regenerate son would respectfully call her ‘mother’.  	As to over-emphasis on temple-entry, I shall be entirely at one with 	you. Temple-entry, again, you will not mind agreeing, is necessary 	for the untouchable if he is to be an integral part of Hindu society 	and an equal partner with the caste Hindus.  	As to your third question, whilst all non-Hindu help would be 	welcome, surely penance has only to be done by those who have 	committed the sin. Temple-entry has got to be given by those who 	have robbed the Harijans of their sacred right, but I would 	certainly draw the line sharply at the natural religious boundary, 	but I should summarily put down any political differences or 	political exploitation. For me this is purely a moral and religious 	question.  Yours 	sincerely,  PROF.

I  shall  be 	interested to know the replies you may get from the  various 	associations in the Punjab. Whatever may have happened in the past, 	we must not leave alone the Punjab Alienation Act. But the first 	thing is to have the full text. 
 As to the disposal of the funds, I propose to carry on the discussion in the Harijan before we evolve a definite policy. You will see my articlelibtech_251_footnotein next Sunday’s Gujarati edition, and I hope to write something for the English editionlibtech_252_footnotealso.
 As to Bengal’s quarrel with the Yeravda Pact, my own opinion is that Satisbabu was hasty in throwing down the challenge. I have written to him to that effect.libtech_253_footnoteHis telegram appeared in the  Harijan inadvertently. Shastri had no time to show it to me, and he used his discretion, as he soon found out, not wisely. But that does not matter. I wrote straightway to Satisbabu and gave him my view. You will have seen my replylibtech_254_footnoteto the British Indian Association. I have sent a copy of it to Sjt. Ghanshyamdas. When we are required to give an opinion, there should be no mincing matters, but so long as the opposers do not refer to us, we need not take any notice. The Pact is a solemn agreement and it can never be altered without the consent of all the parties to it.
 With reference to your tracts, certainly all of them can be advertised in the Harijan. Send a descriptive advertisement.

 The wound which has been inflicted on me has still not healed, but I do not brood over the matter either. I cannot think much about anything just now except the work for the removal of untouchability. It helps me to forget all my sorrows. But whenever I have to think about ’ s conduct, the wound revives and reminds me that it has

 UNTOUCHABILITY AMONG SWAMINARAYANS AND JAINS
A gentleman writes.libtech_268_footnote
 I did not know this. I had always believed from my childhood that there was no untouchability at all among the Swaminarayans because the Gandhi family has had a very close relations with the follo-wers of this sect for many years past. But I have been able to read very little literature of that sect. From the books on Jainism and my Jain friends, I have come to know that there should not be an inkling of untouchability among the Jains. But the Jains also are very much influenced by untouchability. The Poet Rajchandra often used to say that Jainism had spread mainly among the Vaniks, so the Jains who should have the highest courage were filled with cowardice and
 
 
 those who should have the best knowledge have become dry, and penance without knowledge had no power in it. Having known the Jains very well, I bear testimony to the truth in this allegation and that has always made me unhappy. The Jains have always regarded ahimsa as their exclusive virtue but its real form has been completely hidden. Kindness towards living beings other than human beings has always assumed an acute form and the Jains do not hesitate to enforce that even by compulsion. If ahimsa in its pure form were alive among the Jains, there would have been no trace of untouchability in their midst, every Jain would be an embodiment of love and thousands of men and women social workers would have come forth from  amongst them.

193,,193. ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS,"
 ABSOLUTE LAWlibtech_271_footnote
 You seem to have grown very impatient. Please examine care- fully the distinction I have made between the castes and the system of varnas. Untouchability springs from the sub-castes. When untoucha- bility has been removed, the barriers of caste will also go, followed by the divisions of sub-castes. In the case of varnashrama-dharma however there is not the slightest suggestion of untouchability, i.e., in the varnashramadharma as I understand it. It is a spiritual law like physical laws, and has no exceptions. Whether or not we accept it, the
 
 law will continue to operate. One man may rest content after knowing that water is a compound of oxygen and hydrogen; another may discover its properties and potentialities and put them to various uses. It was one such inquiring mind that invented the steam engine. Those who understand the significance of the law of varnas fall into this category. I am never tired of saying that there is no idea of superiority and inferiority in varnadharma as I understand it; where then is the need for a specific demand to remove it? Dr. Ambedkar has a right to be angry with caste Hindus because they do not speak as reasonably as they ought to. You at any rate should understand that to declare a war on varnashramadharma cannot but harm the struggle for the removal of untouchability.
 ONLY ONE VARNA NOWADAYSlibtech_272_footnote
 If we must classify all Hindus according to varnas, there is today no varna other than the Shudra. And the ultimate good of Hindus- ociety lies in admitting this state of affairs. If we admitted this the distinctions of higher and lower varnas would cease to exist without our having to do anything about it. Not that after this no one may endeavour to pursue spiritual knowledge or any other branch of learning; none the less it does mean that all shall earn their bread by their own effort and through body labour and shall apply their other talents in the service of the masses. True, we have not seen varnadharma of this kind being practised; I have however no doubt that it must have been followed in what Hinduism regarded as Satyayugalibtech_273_footnotelibtech_274_footnote.
 WHAT WILL MERE TEMPLE-ENTRY AVAIL?libtech_275_footnote
 I have never believed that mere temple-entry would solve the problem of untouchability but certainly I do believe that untouch- ability will not disappear unless Harijans get the freedom to enter temples like the caste Hindus. And I also believe that after the temple doors open for them means of wealth and wisdom will not be difficult to find. I know very well that even a highly educated Harijan with a good income cannot gain admittance to an orthodox Hindu home, his untouchability does not leave him. But his untouchability will go if
 
 the temples are thrown open to Harijans, i.e., as soon as the unity of religion is found. Anyway I have never said that no constructive work can be accomplished without temple-entry; in fact constructive work is the main programme of the association for removal of untouchability.
 A MATTER OF PLEDGE libtech_276_footnote
 You have completely lost track of [our ideal]. Would one following the path of truth care for the consequence? Temple-entry is certainly a part of the pledge the Hindu society took in the meeting of September 25 held after the Yeravda Pact. Antyajas have a right to enter temples; therefore we ought to try to keep our pledge even if the entire society is opposed to it. To a votary of truth this should be as clear as light. Society’s opposition will be only momentary in so far aswe never want to force our entry. We intend to preserve dharma at the cost of our lives. How long then would the opposition last?
 The resolution pledging all this includes the demand for legislation as well. With this resolution, Hindu society has given the assurance that so far as it can it would certainly get such and such things done through the present Legislatures. And if we fail to achieve it, it is no doubt going to be the first task of the swaraj Parliament. Can there be a more unambiguous pledge? I am surprised that you do not see the great difference between offering and asking for co-operation. You would not co-operate with me if I offered to lead you to a den of vice, but does it follow that you would not want, would not even ask for, my co-operation if I wanted to guide you to the house of the Lord? It was and still is our duty to ask for people’s co-operation for the will.
 BRANCHES OF THE SAME TREE libtech_277_footnote
 The twigs, leaves and fruit of the same tree, though they are separate from one another, do not remain untouchable among themselves; on the contrary they grow, in form and substance, with one another. The human race has to live like a tree. If one branch is severed as untouchable, it dries up and the tree is weakened to that extent. This is exactly what has happened to Hindu society.

194,,194. WOMEN’S DUTY,"
 With the passage of time, I feel that women will have to make a very big contribution to the work of serving the Harijans. The whole world knows that woman most truly protects religion because she is by instinct conservative. If she sustains superstitions, she also observes vratas. A religion cannot be safeguarded without tolerance and patience. Woman is the embodiment of tolerance and patience. Religion would not endure even a moment without faith. A man’s faith cannot measure up to a woman’s. Only linguists may know the true position, but in Sanskrit and in the languages derived from it, we find that many words indicative of virtue are feminine. Shrilibtech_278_footnotelibtech_279_footnote,  smritilibtech_280_footnotelibtech_281_footnote, medhalibtech_282_footnotelibtech_283_footnote, dhritilibtech_284_footnotelibtech_285_footnote, kshamalibtech_286_footnotelibtech_287_footnote, ahimsa,  pavitratalibtech_288_footnotelibtech_289_footnote,  shantilibtech_290_footnotelibtech_291_footnote,  dayalibtech_292_footnotelibtech_293_footnote,  namratalibtech_294_footnotelibtech_295_footnote, are all feminine names. And everywhere these qualities are met with in greater measure in women. I do know of saints who dismiss the proposition by saying that one glimpses these virtues in a woman because she is often illiterate. But the sum total of the experience of the whole world bears testimony to what I say. The above-mentioned virtues have no connection with knowledge of the alphabet but have a direct bearing on religion. Moreover, religion would have perished long ago if it was thought that the educated alone could preserve it. It is not many centuries since the art of printing was invented. But religion has come down to us from time immemorial. We have not heard of any religious preachers having been praised for their knowledge of the letters. On the contrary their followers have proudly affirmed that if they had any literary knowledge, it was of little significance. Whatever intelligence they had in them was only God-given. Their knowledge of the language was not bookish but was due to their penance and devotion to truth.
 Whether all this is true or false, I have long held this belief and even if it is an illusion, so long as it is not removed it is to me not a falsehood but pure truth. So for the religious activity of removing
 
 untouchability, I am laying great store by women’s contribution. Without their help and goodwill, this task cannot be accomplished. Hence I reproduce the following extract from a letter received from a woman from Cuttack.libtech_296_footnote
 Because I have cited the example of Utkal, the women of Gujarat should not feel that I mean to suggest that they do no such work. They should not forthwith bring any such charge against me. But at the same time they should never imagine that they alone render such service and no one else does so. If anyone has this misconception, it is only to remove it that I have quoted the above letter. The women, and even the men, of Utkal are considered to have the least awakening. But even there women have started working. This may, perhaps, give fresh encouragement to the women of Gujarat. I do not know whether even in Gujarat the women are doing such work as the women in Cuttack do. If they are doing it, they should send me an account of it and if they are not, they should start doing so.
 Men as well as women have to do two kinds of work—one among the Harijans and the other among caste Hindus. One has to bring home patiently to the caste Hindus that untouchability is a great sin and also raise fresh workers from among them. The magnitude of the work is so great and the dirt of untouchability has accumulated to such an extent that as long as several men and women do not come out to work, this monster of untouchability will not be destroyed. If fortunately there has been a genuine religious awakening, all those who have had such awakening will be able to do this work easily.

 "
195,,"195. PROPAGANDA v.
CONSTRUCTION","
 The summary which I gave of a Harijan’s severe criticism of the Savarna Harijan Seva Sangh of his Province has  produced  good effect. The workers have become vigilant. But they are also baffled. Does putting money into the pockets of Harijans mean constructive work or teaching a few children, digging a few wells and getting a few temples opened? This is work for a century. Propaganda means a countrywide effort to create among the people a feeling against untouchability through speeches, pamphlets, and social dinners, parties, etc. (The reader should understand the difference between
 
 social dinner and inter-dining. Social friendly dinners mean sitting together for meals at a social get-together, each one eating from his own plate food which is acceptable to him. While interdining means eating at each other’s home food prepared by the inviting party. Brahmins and Vanias who believe in caste restrictions will participate in social dinners but may not associate with inter-dining.) What a contrast between constructive work progressing at snail’s pace and propaganda work conducted at the speed of a hurricane! This is what puzzles the workers.
 Propaganda is of course essential. But mere propaganda is likely to prove as short-lived as a bubble. Really speaking, the most effective propaganda lies in pure constructive work. But since pure constructive work is a near impossibility, propaganda is necessary to supplement constructive work. Pure constructive work means constructive activities by men and women workers of character who have perfect faith in the cause and who do their work in a missionary spirit. We, however, are imperfect. We may, therefore, sincerely do the best we can by way of constructive work and simultaneously carry on propaganda, too.
 Here I wish to examine the question only from the financial point of view. One thing should be self-evident, namely, that we are bound to get a hundred per cent return on whatever money is put into the Harijans, pockets in the right manner. Whereas the money spent on propaganda work will remain an uncertain investment till we actually see the result.
 I would, therefore, advise all branches of the Sangh to utilize the contributions they have received for constructive activities. We shall never have to repent for the money so spent. If we get from among caste Hindus, teachers, masons, carpenters, etc., to work without remuneration or for nominal remuneration, our constructive work will progress so fast that we shall have very little need for propaganda. In that case the entire money except what is paid as wages to the caste Hindu teachers and artisans will go to the Harijans. I would regard the money thus spent on running a school or digging a well as reaching the pockets of Harijans. Our ideal, of course, should be to see that the wages in connection with public wells or schools for Harijans should go into the pockets of Harijans. But, till such time as we are able to reach this ideal, we should humbly content ourselves with the next best thing. Every institution for Harijan welfare should maintain a separate account for such constructive work.
 Propaganda work should be self-supporting. Pamphlets ought not to be distributed free of charge. A public-spirited printing press may print at nominal charge or free of charge, and the cost price of
 each pamphlet may be borne by the people. One who wishes to circulate the pamphlet among his acquaintances free of charge should pay for the copies himself or anyone from among the people whose interest has been aroused in the movement should pay for them. Pamphlets received free are thrown into the waste-paper basket. Only a speculator would do such business. But even he adds such expenses to the price of the things to be sold. A religious body like the Harijan Seva Sangh simply cannot afford to indulge in  such  speculation. From whom would it recover the expenses incurred?  What information about eradication of untouchability can we get from a report stating that one crore copies of pamphlets were distributed? Who can say how many people cleansed themselves of the evil of untouchability after reading them? Who can say, even, how many people read them? If, however, the reader had paid one pie at least for  a copy, we may assume that he must have read some portion of it.
 Propaganda work carried on along these lines would not only be self-supporting but, if it becomes popular, it would promote constructive work, too. I cherish the ambition even today that, if the Harijan weeklies become popular, we may be able to save  some money from their proceeds and utilize it for constructive work. The reader may note that some of the work of these weeklies is done with the help of volunteers and that, whenever money is paid, it is paid at lower than market rates. I mention this fact merely to point out that the Harijan weeklies are in the nature of propaganda work and that they are also self-supporting. Harijan is published in Bengali, Tamil, Gujarati and Hindi. The Gujarati edition is on the point of becoming self-supporting. The Hindi has not become so. The principle for pamphlets, books, etc., should be the same as for the Harijan weeklies.
 And now about the expenses on the salaries and travelling allowances of the workers engaged in propaganda activities. Most of such workers would be caste Hindus. They, however, would never ask for any payment. What effect can the speeches of paid workers have on the people? Their travelling expenses should not have to be borne by the institution employing them but should be met by the people. That is to say, the reception committees of the places which have invited them should bear the expenses. The permanent body may arrange these things but should not bear their expenses. And lastly about the office expenses, the salary of the accountant, the travelling expenses of the secretary, the rent for the building, etc. This expenditure should not exceed ten per cent of the total budget. Any institution whose administrative expenses total up to more than ten per cent should be looked upon  as a self-destroying and useless organization.
 It is my firm opinion that the institution for serving Harijans which has been set up solely for the purification of religion and which exists for that one purpose cannot continue to function in any other way. If I have been able to clarify my idea the reader should be convinced that
    it 				includes a 				mighty organization; there 				is great 				scope for widespread propaganda;  it 				is a test 				of the 				people’s faith 				and also conducive to 				its growth.    
 Finally, it is necessary to state that I am offering advice without being engaged in that field at the moment; so my views may be  wrong. If they do not appeal to the workers, intellect, they deserve to be discarded. Even if they appear suitable, I do not have the right to get them accepted or put into practice, but the Harijan Sevak Sangh and its sub-committees certainly have that right. My duty is to give my opinion and to keep quiet. The institutions concerned may give thought to this article and send their suggestions to Thakkar Bapa. Then, on receiving his suggestions, all of them may act accordingly.

  	My joint  letterlibtech_298_footnotelibtech_299_footnoteset  forth  my  views  not  necessarily  for  your 	acceptance. You are to do just what you think is best. My letter was 	a help to your thoughts and no more. You can get and give the best 	only if you do what appears to you to be proper. You two have come 	to see things for yourselves and not to take a set course at the 	Ashram.  	I know you did not suggest but I meant that  many  in  the Ashram 	were unconsciously slavishly following the Ashram routine and 	therefore not getting the best out of it. And then many of them, 	unlike you, have come in the hope of forming their character and 	making something out of themselves. They may and can afford to 	follow the routine unintelligently  but  you  may  not  and  dare  	not.  If   you   follow    the    routine   you   must    do   so    	intelligently  and     
 whole-heartedly. Therefore you should take only what you can easily digest of the routine.
 You must not get malaria. You should take things easy. The bowels must be kept in order. The stomach should not be loaded. No cold bath whilst you are at all weak. No pulses, only a little bread plus milk, greens and fruit. Smear the uncovered limbs with paraffin oil. Do not be afraid of it or its smell. It does not soil anything. The mosquitoes keep away from paraffin. Do not live under tension. This is a mental process. ‘Be careful for nothing’ is both a spiritual and physiological maxim.
 The Punch is quite all right in spite of the hard facts of life but the harder fact is that neither Mahadev nor I nor any other of our company can give a minute to anything outside Harijan and other kindred work. Therefore we arrange a Punch and Judy show from among the threads of our work. And it beats the original, I assure you. You may pass this on to your aunt.
 Others besides you have asked me to write on Jesus. If God wants me to do it, He will find the time for me.

 You did right in paying Parachure Shastri the expenses for the journey and fixing Rs. 30 to be sent to his family.

If milk is preserved for him in a clean bottle every day and if the bottle is wrapped in thick or double or twofold wet cloth it would remain as cool as ice and he can drink it without heating it. It would be better if he drinks unboiled milk. The bottles and the corks should be washed every day in boiling water. The cork should be made of strong material. The bottle should be filled to the top, so that no air might remain inside. I think that all those who are trying the experiment of living on milk would benefit more if they drink it unboiled. I have been drinking my milk unboiled for the last six weeks. Show this letter to Purushottam. His view should be treated as final. Kusum still gets fever, and yet she is better!

It can be done only 	if everybody tries to do what he can independently of others. Do you 	do that? I hope you know my definition of brahmacharya. Do 	you think you can observe such brahmacharya?

I am glad that you wrote about your health. If you eat crushed 	cabbage, uncooked, it may possibly do you no harm, but it will 	certainly do no harm if you eat it boiled. It is not necessary to 	eat all vegetables uncooked. It will be enough if you eat a few raw 	vege- tables. But the main thing is that you should speak as little 	as possible. The delay in following this rule may lead to such 	serious conse- quences that subsequent self-control will not avail 	you. Everything should be done at the right time. The throat 	requires rest exactly when it is sensitive.  	I am glad that you became acquainted with Maruti. Write to the 	couple from time to time. Lakshmi wants a companion from the Ashram. 	Is there anybody whom you can send? Also write to Lakshmidas and 	find out if she can stay there.  	Jamnalalji told me that there were many Maharashtrian ladies in the 	Ashram whom he had sent there. It is his desire, which he wanted me 	to convey to you, that you should train some of them for the Mahila 	Ashram. Is there anybody whom you can train? She should be a mature 	woman. Let me know if there is any such. Jamnalalji wants this to be 	conveyed to Narandas also. I will not mention this message

 March 26, 1933
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 This is in continuation of the message from Jamnalal which I have given in my letterlibtech_310_footnotelibtech_311_footnoteto Prema. One reason why we have been able to take no service from the older women in the Ashram (after the struggle) is the Ashram’s lack of ability, that is, my lack of ability. When Jamnalal talked to me about some other ladies, I felt a stab in my heart. He also felt unhappy that he had to make the suggestion which he did. But what could he do? He had often asked me in the past for workers, but I could not do anything then. I think we have got an opportunity now. I first thought  of  Lakshmibehnlibtech_312_footnotelibtech_313_footnoteand  then  of Durgalibtech_314_footnotelibtech_315_footnote. There is a Mahila Ashram in Maharashtra, and that too  in Wardha. There will be Vinoba’s company and guidance, too. There is also Janakibehn. Will Lakshmibehn agree to go and stay there without Panditji?  Will Panditji like that?  If not, why not?  Mathurilibtech_316_footnotelibtech_317_footnotealso will go and stay with Lakshmibehn. She will get the same kind of training there that she does in the Ashram. If Lakshmibehn does not agree to go or cannot go, why shouldn’t Durga go? She is in any case bound to remain separated [from Mahadev] at present, probably for some years. She will not have to do hard physical work there. She will have only to supervise. The burden will not be too heavy for her health. She may certainly take Nirmalalibtech_318_footnotelibtech_319_footnotewith her if she wishes. Narayanswamilibtech_320_footnote
 
    India          
 also may go if he wishes. I thought about Kashilibtech_321_footnotelibtech_322_footnotetoo.  But  she  is  a complete invalid and so I dropped the idea. I cannot think about Santoklibtech_323_footnotelibtech_324_footnotejust  now,  and  I  do  not  know  Jamna’slibtech_325_footnotecapacity.   I   think Lakshmibehn and Durga would be the best. Manibehnlibtech_326_footnotelibtech_327_footnote, too, I think, can go. She has done such work in Champaran. I have not discussed this idea with Mahadev here. I cannot think of any other senior women. I think I have given you ample information. If any lady volunteers are willing to go, let me know. And if the Maharashtrian ladies who have recently joined wish to go, they also may go. Their services will certainly be required. But there should be a mature and experienced woman at their head who would look after all the women as her daughters and be in charge of the Ashram. The work requires maturity, purity of character and common sense. Other qualities will follow from this.
I hope Mohanlibtech_328_footnotelibtech_329_footnotehas fully recovered.
 I have already written about Raojibhai of Dharasana and, therefore, say nothing about him in this letter. It is not our duty to shelter him. I think it is beyond our means to do so.
 I have also written to you about buffalo flesh. Sitla Sahai continues to write to me. But I tell him every time in my reply that he should convince you. Does Mahavir write to you? I have had no letter from him at all. Gangabehn has helped him to get a job of Rs. 25 per month,libtech_330_footnoteand she says in her letter that she will try to get some work for Krishnamaiyadevi also. How are Maitri and Durga? I had no letter from libtech_331_footnote. This creates a doubt in my mind whether she has fallen

  	I shall write a few things just now and the rest later. Your 	articles are the only thing in the Hindi Harijan that we find 	worth reading. Your language is sweet and vigorous but I cannot be 	satisfied with this. A major portion of the material will have to be 	sent from here till proper arrangements are made there. Mahadev and  	I  will  translate as well as write original articles. Viyogiji can 	correct our Hindi. 
 Moreover the Sangh should supply notices, suggestions, provincial news, and such things. All this should go toward raising the sale of Hindi Harijan to thousands of copies. It ought to become the chief gazette of the Seva Sangh. I have refused to send items to Ramdasji or anyone else for translation. Harijan Sevak cannot be successful at all under such an arrangement. If no translators can be found in Delhi and Viyogiji cannot undertake the translation or arrange for it I would consider it necessary to discontinue the Harijan Sevak.
I notice that there is more work to do for the bastis of Calcutta.
 I understand about the David Scheme. The suggestion should be considered. I shall write more. Appoint the Selection Board.

If that is so, and if you do not think 	Maganlal’s presence necessary at all, you should wire to him from 	there asking him not to come.

I feel worried about Champa’s and Ratilal’slibtech_342_footnoteattitude. Champa will naturally follow her father’s 	advice and Ratilal seems to be under Champa’s influence at 	present. I have no trust now in Prabhashankarlibtech_343_footnote. His motives do not at all seem to be pure. That day 	he showed no regard for truth or courtesy. I felt that for the sake 	of money he was ready to harm the interests of his daughter and 	son-in-law. I will not, therefore, be inclined in his favour, that 	is, I will not approve of his being made the guardian. However, I 	certainly do not think myself to         
 be the only friend of the Doctor. I regard you and Ratubhailibtech_344_footnoteto be equally his friends. You may certainly, therefore, appoint Prabhashan- kar as the guardian if you so wish. Sardar, to whom I have shown this letter, is of my opinion. You may rest assured that I will not come in the way of anything that may be decided. I have only explained my own feeling. If it finds no echo in your heart, it should be ignored. I am writing this so that I may have a clear conscience in the matter. I will have no objection to your showing this letter to Prabhashankar. In fact I wish that you should do so. It seems best that he should know what I feel. I do not wish to write all this to Champa and Ratilal. It is not right that I should tell them all this. But just as I feel unhappy at the thought of creating ill-will towards Prabhashankar in their minds, I would be untrue to you if I did not tell you what I thought.
 I am not happy that this business is getting complicated and dragging on. Please try your best to settle it as early as possible.

 March 27, 1933
 Now more than ever before redoubled efforts should be made to open all the private temples to the Harijans.
 Asked if the failure of the Assembly to pass the motion for circulation of the Bill held up temple-entry, Gandhiji replied in the negative and proceeded:
 It does not mean that the temple-entry question would be held up, but it does mean that what is due to the Harijans in the light of the pledge given in September last has not been paid and, therefore, every effort should be made in order to redeem that pledge. Meanwhile whatever other ways are open to educating public opinion and gaining access to temples for the Harijans should be tried and one thing that naturally suggests itself to me is the opening of all private temples to Harijans.
 There is no custom in connection with the private temples which can be pleaded by the third party in order to prevent the entry of Harijans to them. They should be thrown open to them and those who have none may even build new temples for the Hindus in general and these would be the model temples with model management and model priests so that they would be a true expression of Hinduism.

 March 28, 1933
 MY DEAR VERRIER,
 Although I have often found that truth however ugly it might look in reality did good, I believe that A.libtech_350_footnotecame nearer to you both. The fact is that even if one party is pure the others tend to become so. But when the others are striving in the same direction the success of one almost ensures the success of the others.
 I did not tell her that you were being unconsciously self-dece- ived. She says she did not wish to convey any such meaning to you. I had no proof that you were being self-deceived. What I did say was that all of us were likely to be self-deceived but that you  were  incapable of conscious falsehood and that therefore you  would  confess your promise at once if you had ever made it.
There is no doubt that she loves you both and she wants to work
 
 with you. She is doing some Harijan work now. I have told her that it [is] impossible at present but if all goes well, there is no reason why she should not be able to work with you later.
 And now about Marylibtech_351_footnotelibtech_352_footnote. To me it seems quite necessary that you should separate for the time being and test yourselves. Mary or you may go to Almora or to Sabarmati or Wardha or any other place you may think fit and do there some Harijan work of a temporary character. If you have shed exclusive love altogether you should feel happy as well in association as in separation and just now there should be positive joy in separation. I have found this indispensable in all such cases and there have been several. You should think it over and give immediate effect to the proposal if you find substance in it.
And now for your health.
 It is now 3.45 a.m. and I must leave you in God’s care. His care is the only true care. A human being’s is good enough only in so far as it anticipates His. You will therefore accept of my suggestions only that which finds an echo in your heart. Every moment makes me humbler and conscious of the sublime fact that man’s true effort consists only in knowing the will of God who is Truth.
 You carry the love of every one of the company. With deepest love,

 I thank you for your letter. You have no cause whatsoever for apologizing for doing what you conceive is your duty. I give the others the same credit for honesty of purpose that I would claim for myself. All therefore I would expect you to do is never to swerve from truth even in order to gain an end which you may consider to be desirable. You will then receive congratulations from me for your fighting me, and who knows that you may not teach me to see the Light if I am enveloped in darkness. It is therefore in a friendly spirit that   I   shall   approach   your   paperlibtech_353_footnotelibtech_354_footnote,  and   if   I   find   untruthfulness, unfairness or bitterness anywhere in it, I shall draw your attention, and  I would like you to do the same thing towards me if you find in the Harijan any untruth, any exaggeration, any discourtesy towards those who think differently from me. Rightly or wrongly, I regard untouchability as the greatest curse for Hindu religion. I am therefore sparing no pains to get rid of that curse. But if it is a blessing and if anybody can make me see it, I shall accept him as my deliverer, for, he would have saved me from an error which I have nursed practically for the past fifty years."

  	I hope you received my letterlibtech_355_footnotein Hindi which I wrote the day before yesterday, 	i.e., 26th. I do think that we ought to find out a means of dealing 	with the basti problem in Calcutta as a whole, and not 	piecemeal. When therefore you next go to Calcutta I suggest your 	having an informal meeting of the principal Municipal Councillors. 	No matter what vested interests have grown up, they should be     
 attacked and the problem dealt with. From what you write to me, the cheapest method evidently seems to be to demolish these bastis. The opposition to the introduction of a more humane method of carrying night-soil seems to me to be perfectly useless. Improved methods must in the beginning stages mean more expense, but undoubtedly less in the end. The question behind all the difficulties that arise resolves itself, as a rule, into apathy on the part of those who profess their appreciation of the necessity for reform, but are not prepared to sacrifice anything for it. You must therefore turn this apathy into active sympathy, and a way out will be quickly found.
 As to the Hindi Harijan, I wrote to you the day before yesterday telling you that the only articles that were found worth reading were yours, except the first. Your style is pleasing, simple, idiomatic. Your method of dealing with the subject is plain, direct and easily understandable. Of course the translation of my articles was faulty, but that difficulty will now be got over by sending  translations  ready-made from here. The Hindi will have to be polished there. This ought to reduce expense and improve the paper.
 Pray do not worry about the David Scheme. I just told you how  I came to write about it. But I quite understand your difficulty. If it becomes necessary, we must naturally fall back upon  the  Central Fund. But let us for a while wait and see if we can get even half a dozen subscribers with the full amounts. I do not despair; only I never get time to frame nice letters. But I will do so one of these days.

I wrote simply on the strength of what N. Devi had told me 	and afterwards written to me.

That is the mildest manner in which I could put it. Nor am I 	satisfied about this guru of yours if that is the gentleman whom N. 	Devi has described. Here I am on delicate grounds, because I know 	nothing of him and I may be doing the gravest injustice to him. You 	cannot disown your responsibility about your companions. You were 	all working together, the central attraction being N. Devi, at that 	time not a fountain of purity. You cannot divest yourself of 	responsibility for all that happened during that period. I would 	like you therefore to be a little more introspective than you have 	been, and tell me whether the scavenging work continues unabated as 	it was begun, and if it is continuing, who are the workers, how is 	it being done, who is the leader, and what is the result up to date.

         MY 	DEAR N. ,       March 	28, 1933 
  	I have your letters of 23rd and 24th. I expect that you left for the 	village on Sunday as you had intended. May Truth take care of you 	there!  	I know from personal experience how difficult it is to wash heavy 	khadi if you do not have plenty of water. Generally washing comes 	before sewing, but if it is the same cloth that requires washing and 	sewing, the sewing undoubtedly precedes, because you thereby save 	time. Washing will tear the cloth more at the point where it 	requires mending, therefore more time has to be given to sewing if 	it is done after the washing. Your dress itself may require a little 	alteration when you have got rid of all the ornamental part of it 	and made it just so as to protect the body and satisfy the 	surrounding convention. The quantity required is very small, the 	convention being the convention of the poorest. I 	am glad you heard from Sir Todd Hunter.  	I am not at all satisfied with R.’s letters. There is still the 	old infatuation lurking, and as I read them, a disposition to 	justify the past.  I  have   writtenlibtech_365_footnoteto   him   gently   drawing   his   attention   to 	  the inadequacy of his letters. Durgadas’s letter I like still 	less. The mode of address is unpardonable. He can be no guide, 	friend and brother to you, who, although on his own showing he knew 	that you were a fallen woman, did not lift his little linger to save 	his sister. There is no question of your resuming your 	correspondence. Your correspon- dence just now must be with God of 	Truth and yourself. Nothing should come between you and Him. I come 	in because I am witness to the promise that you have made to your 	Maker and because I want to be able to claim you as a permanent 	co-worker in the service of the Harijans, in my opinion the most 	suppressed in the world, but neither I nor you can render that 	service unless that direct touch with Truth is completely 	established and the utmost purity attainable by a human being has 	become the exclusive passion. You 	must beware of cold.  	If you can procure whole wheat meal you ought not to take any rice 	at all. You should learn how to make chapatis. It is an incredibly 	simple performance. Take 4 ounces of clean wheat meal, mix in water    
 and knead it well, roll it on any smooth surface, wooden or stone, with a rolling pin—even a clean ruler will serve the purpose—and roll it slightly thinner than a cardboard piece and bake it on a flat iron disk, turning the sides while it is baked. Out of 4 ounces you can make six of these chapatis, 6 inches in diameter. These would be perfectly digestible. I am sure that the lady of the house or hut where you are to stay knows all this simple cookery. Pulses should be avoided altogether. Of tender coconut you may take one whole per day if it is very tender, and of course you use all the water in the coconut also. You ought to procure some fruit and green vegetables, not potatoes and the like, but leaves, marrow, cucumber, pumpkin, etc.

  	l. If, in spite of your mother’s opposition, you regard 	eradication of untouchability as your dharma, it would be your duty 	to follow it as much as you can, but keeping your mother mollified.

 Were they in need of these things? If they were it was well that the things were distributed.

Such are the questions that arise in my mind. But I do not wish to judge your action. And I have no right to comment on any activity in which the revered Malaviyaji was himself participating.

 Two large-sized telescopeslibtech_371_footnoteplaced in the open yard occupied by Mr. Gandhi in the Yeravda Jail presented an unusual spectacle amidst the severe simplicity of the jail surroundings. . . .
 [Mr. Gandhi said:]
They are for me.
 Astronomy had always interested him, Mr. Gandhi stated, but after entering the jail this time, he was devoting himself to it with greater interest than ever before. Mr. Gandhi proceeded:
 Now  it  has  become  a  passion  with  me.   Every   free  minute  I get I devote myself to it. It is a wonderful subject, and more than anything else impresses upon me the mystery of God and the majesty of the universe. To be lying on your back in the open air on a starry night and regarding universe after universe in the immeasurable expanse, you cannot help becoming a worshipper of God. My mind leaps with joy as I do so. Oh, it is marvellous !
 It did not require a study of higher mathematics, Mr. Gandhi added, as his interest in astronomy was not professional. He had been reading numerous books on the subject and with the aid of the apparatus before him, he would see more of those universes with his own eyes. He could easily understand their use as their adjustments, though delicate, were simple.

  	You have sent me a cutting from the Free Press about the 	opening ceremony of a school. What I should like to have from you is 	not Press cuttings for reproduction, but an authenticated report 	from you so that I can publish it under the authority of the 	Provincial Board. Sjt. Anjaria should have supplied you with this 	report of the opening of the school in Andheri.  	In the report it is stated that the gathering consisted mainly of 	Harijan men and boys. Could that be true? An  authentic  report 	should also state how much the running of the school is likely to 	cost and how much has been already collected towards the cost, and 	there should be something of the description of the building itself. 	And then it is bad to have to print a report of an isolated event.

  	I have your letter of 26th instant. You are right. I do want truth 	and love to peep out of every word I write, and if they do not do 	so, it is not due to want of effort on my part. You need not 	therefore be afraid about my consciously rubbing up R. the wrong 	way. I wrotelibtech_374_footnotelibtech_375_footnoteto him yesterday expressing about the same sentiments 	that you have in your letter before me. He sent me two letters in 	the same cover, both of them were unsatisfactory. I 	could see that truth had not yet dawned upon him.  	You will describe your new situation as fully as you can, your 	surroundings, the neighbours, the population of the village, the 	things     
 that can be purchased in the village, its distance from Mysore or Bangalore or any big centre, distance from the nearest railway station, the condition of water supply, the composition of the population and the like. Tell me also whether you can have good milk there. What are the cattle in the village? And if you cannot get good cow’s milk, and if there are goats there, you will not hesitate to have goat’s milk for S.libtech_376_footnoteYou should learn to milk goats yourself and have the goat brought before you, so that you are sure of the purity of the milk supplied, and if there are cows there, learn to milk the cows yourself. If you feel weak or if you find that your digestive apparatus does not keep up to mark, I would like you to go back to milk and butter, but no butter so much as milk, and take unfired milk, as you saw me take it. I should then have no anxiety about your health.
 Whilst I would like you to live the life of the poorest of Harijans,  I do not want you to do the impossible, and therefore whatever your health peremptorily demands, you should take if you tan get it for the begging. If you cannot, in a perfectly honourable way, God will give you the strength to suffer privation, but even then you will not misfeed yourself. Fasting is better than taking food that you cannot assimilate or that gives you no stamina. A few dry dates or raisins or figs well washed will at a pinch sustain you and even S., but I am sure that if you have living faith in living truth, it will not try you beyond your capacity for endurance.

238,"March 29, 1933",LETTER TO PANCHANAN TARKARATNA,"
      
 March 29, 1933
 DEAR PANDITJI,
 I thank you for your letter which Motibabu has kindly  translated for me.
 On the one hand I see that you consider the matter of untouchability supersensuous and on the other you are applying mere mundane situations to the matter. Personally, I do not regard untouchability as a supersensuous matter. I regard nothing as supersensuous which is capable of being proved through the senses. Thus, I would consider the question of the existence of God as supersensuous but not so the shape of the earth, and as our Shastras teach us, it would be a misuse of spiritual gifts to apply them for the discovery or for proving the properties of material objects. Untouchability as described in the Shastras is a purely material thing. There is nothing supersensuous in it. Therefore if I apply the ordinary laws governing the examination of ordinary things I am doing no violence to the Shastras.
 Thus examined, in spite of what may be said in the Shastras, hereditary untouchability has no basis, and if a Chandala,  so described, did not disclose his birth, there is no test whereby he could
 be distinguished from the rest. What applies to him applies with much greater force to his progeny.
 I am afraid that your analogy of the Red Indians, the Australian Indians and other such races has no application whatsoever to Indian conditions, and it is historically untrue to say that in India there has been no mixture of races. On the contrary, there is incontestable proof that mixture of blood has been constantly going on in India since the known beginnings of time.
 As to the pandits whose testimony I have cited, several who have upheld my interpretation I have not even had the  pleasure  of knowing. They have accepted the same authority that you are quoting, only they have given a different interpretation to yours.
 With due humility I claim that though I can make no pretension to Sanskrit learning, I know enough of Sanskrit and have read enough of the scriptures to be able to form my own judgment on conflicting interpretations being presented to me of the Shastras.
 With reference to your son, my own recollection is distinct that he was to have come as your representative, not in order to have a religious disputation but to hold a discourse with me in order to present your viewpoint and in order that I could understand it, so that if it was at all possible we might find ourselves on the same platform.libtech_378_footnote
 Surely, that was an object wholly different from that of the pandits who came to engage in a set debate between rival schools of thoughts with judges to regulate the debate. Your son coming as one of these disputants was not the same as his coming as your deputy without the conditions that governed the Pandits. Of course there was nothing wrong about his being one of the pandits, but that could not be a fulfilment of your promise. If he had the intention of engaging in a friendly and personal conversation with me after the debate, he could still do so. I shall be pleased to meet him any time he comes and patiently listen to all he might have to say. I can give you my assurance that I have not shut my ears to anything that might have still to be said on behalf of the part that upholds modern untouchability as an integral part of Hinduism.
 Yours sincerely,

243,"March 	29, 1933",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
  	Is it truthfulness to live in the Ashram but follow a mode of life 	different from the Ashram ideal? I want you to get out of this. I 	would rather say that you lived thousands of miles away from me  but 	followed truth than that you should stay with me and live  in  	falsehood. I have already failed once in judging you. Similarly, it 	is possible that I may be proved wrong again in distrusting you. I 	pray to God that I may be. If that happens, my first failure will be 	cancelled out. At present, however, I feel that you have been 	deceiving me. [From 	Gujarati]  Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, Vol. III, p. 	205           March 	29, 1933  CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	I got your big packet of mail today. You will find with this a 	detailed letter of suggestions to Purushottam. Ramabehn cannot be 	got operated upon immediately. In any case do get her examined by 	Haribhailibtech_382_footnote. So 	far as I can judge, the operation will not be an easy one. I also 	doubt its necessity. Is it likely that the arms which did not become 	limp all these years will become so now? I cannot be easily alarmed 	by such a fear. Kanu’slibtech_383_footnotelibtech_384_footnotecase 	requires careful thinking. Get him examined again      
 by Haribhai. Let me know what he says. The pain in the arm seems to have lasted very long. I think it is not being vigorously massaged. He is likely to benefit if that part is also exposed to the rays of the sun. I have had no experience as to whether it would help better if the rays were passed through a red glass. My experience means the experience of Hanumantrai. Ask Purushottam to read Dr. Sharma’s book which we have there and to try the experiments described in it. Perhaps they may help.
 I understand what you say regarding Narahari’s letter. Discuss with him and other responsible inmates of the Ashram, the suggestions which you approve of and let me know the result. I think you will find most of the suggestions acceptable. That you will be able to please Narahari is also an important consideration.
 Mohan must have recovered now. His illness has lasted quite
long.
 It is not that I want only scholars’ criticism of  Ishucharitalibtech_385_footnotelibtech_386_footnote.  I
 want yours and the women’s too, if you and they have read the book. Since the book has been written for the layman, Valji is eager to know the opinions of all. He wants them no matter whether they are favourable or otherwise.
 You should start utilizing Parachure Shastri’s services now. Has his son been given any work? Can he do anything? Can you control him?
I will wait for your next letter for your views regarding Shanta.
 I have written to Santok regarding Keshu. You need not write from there. She and Damodardas are coming tomorrow to see me. I have a letter from Keshu written yesterday in which he says that he may not now go there.
 If Dhirulibtech_387_footnotehimself wants to learn painting in a spirit of dedication and agrees to observe the [Ashram] vows in Santiniketan and live there as an ideal student, if he is also ready to learn whatever else he can learn there, I think he can do excellent service afterwards. Painting also can be of two kinds, divine and demoniac, sattvik and rajasik, moral and immoral. I believe every word of what Dhiru has said. If he is so cager to learn painting, I think we should encourage him. Just as Panditji has dedicated his art to service and people get its benefit and are likely to get it in a still greater measure in future, so also can one dedicate painting to service. Painting is silent music. We can see from our experience of paintings which excite passion that, if a painter painted pictures which would purify us of passion, their power would
 
 be felt even by the coarsest of men. There are pictures painted with this aim. But of course there are very few painters of this type. If somebody from the Ashram becomes such an artist, we should admire him. Probably you do not know that we had started training Balkrishnalibtech_388_footnotelibtech_389_footnoteto make him such a sculptor. He had even made a few statues. He himself then gave up the work. He has even given his reason for doing so in the letter which I received from him this week. We shall not mind if Dhiru’s effort to learn painting also meets the same fate. I don’t know how they teach painting in Santiniketan. But there is no better place in India at present for learning this art. But I should also like to say that if anybody else, following  Dhiru’s example, wishes to learn painting, we may not readily agree. Dhiru’s heart has been set on this art for many years and his love of it is pure. He seems to be well-behaved in other ways and has the strength and the will to observe the Ashram rules. He has also been living in the Ashram for many years. If these assumptions are not correct, we cannot send him. We cannot send him also if there is the slightest doubt about the purity of his character. He can be sent only if he understands all this, willingly accepts the conditions which I have put in my letter to him and if all of you can trust his word, and if all these requirements are fulfilled I think it is our duty to let him go. All of you should consider the case from this point of view and decide. Don’t forget to invite Narahari to join in the discussion. After the incident concerning . . .libtech_390_footnotelibtech_391_footnote, we should be careful. A frightened man sees a cause of fear everywhere. If Dhiru indulges in lustful fancies, if he is a boy with an impure mind, painting is likely to prove a dangerous pursuit for him. These arts are alluring. The world itself is alluring, and it is no wonder that the arts of an alluring world should be equally alluring. But just as the world, though it is alluring to the senses, can be a field, for attaining moksha, can be a manifestation of the glory of God, so can art. Out of a thousand artists one may become a bhakta. I know that nine hundred and ninety-nine become lovers of the flesh. If you have faith in Dhiru that he will be one in a thousand, if all of you feel sure about that, let him have your blessings and go. Having done so, we should trust to our fate. We will dedicate to Shri Krishna our decision to send him.
 I started writing this letter before the morning prayer and end it exactly at four o’clock. It is still ten minutes before the prayer starts.

 March 29, 1933
 CHI. PANNALAL,
 I have received both your letters. You have been hasty in passing judgement on Narandas. The decision about Mahavirlibtech_392_footnotewas not his; it was mine. Considering his rudeness, the lies that he resorted to and his financial bungling, any other decision was impossible. Behind the seemingly harsh decision, there is only pity. Krishnamaiyadevilibtech_393_footnotedid not know the truth. Even then, after Narandas gave his opinion, Panditji, Totaramji and Chimanlal conducted an inquiry. They gave their views separately and their conclusions were the same. Only then were Mahavir and Krishnamaiyadevi asked to leave the Ashram. I had not been inclined to have women [in the Ashram]. But Narandas showed courage. I have very little to do even with the help that is to be given. I had only suggested that they should be enabled to reach Darjeeling and provided with expenses for two months.
 Narandas found this course difficult and found an easier way. The Ashram was under no obligation to accommodate the Giri family. In having them there, I had saddled Maganlal with a great burden, and had stretched the rules of the Ashram. It was with great difficulty that we passed these many years. I have no regrets about it. But if I go on witnessing violations of the Ashram rules, there certainly will  be  reason for me to regret. Now if Mahavir continues with his tales of woe, that will be one more reason why he should go. He is not as innocent as you think. Thinking him innocent I am not prepared to make him helpless. If you have the time, go deeply into the matter and if you find you are mistaken correct the mistake. If not, and if you think I am in the wrong, show me how.
 Do not judge anyone in haste, certainly not your colleagues. You have written to me that you heard many complaints against Narandas. Let me know whatever you have heard.
 
 Let me know your programme if you can. Where is Gangabehn at present? She has not written to me at all after she came to meet me. It is long since I had any letter from Nanibehn.

  	Today I take this up after prayer and after writing important 	letters to the Ashram about the ailing persons of whom three are 	having the fasting cure under Purushottam’s supervision. So you 	are not to grumble if I give this only half an hour.  	Your letter came in yesterday, i.e., record good time after your 	transfer.    
 You are hard on poor babies!! You forget that you were one and  I expect thankful for having survived the baby stage! Celibacy for those who can appreciate it and live up to it is a very fine thing. But it must be allowed that it is a supernatural state for embodied beings. They live in pain and will to the end of time. It is therefore perhaps improper to be impatient with the married state and its results. After all we owe Gautam Buddha, Jesus, Zoroaster, Mohammed, Rama, Krishna, St. Francis and numberless such men and women to the married state. We cannot afford to be self-righteous. We  cannot fathom the mystery of God. We need therefore to be charitable at every step. We ourselves stand in need of charity every moment. Married state is the only deliverance for millions from a life of lust and misery. It is well that Verrier and Mary have been able to give up the idea of marriage but I was not going to judge them if they had married. They are both striving to do the best that is possible for them. They are brave and true souls. No one is expected to do more than the best. To live up to one’s dharma (i.e., the best in one) is better than trying (vainly), to live up to another’s dharma (i.e., his best). A sweeper who lives up to his state is superior to the Brahmin who is merely playing at his state. Is all this clear, I wonder? I did not want to deliver this sermon to you. But your references to Verrier and the poor dead twins jarred and I thought I would warn you. Do not brood over this. These are momentary things in you. Your bottom is sound and fully weather-proof. It is good that you pour out your innermost thoughts to me without staying to think how I would take them. I want to know you just as you are. And here goes the 5.30 bugle. I must not stay with you longer today. The rest you will have from Ba’s letter.

247,"March 	30, 1933",LETTER TO SATIS CHANDRA DAS GUPTA,"
           March 	30, 1933  DEAR 	SATISBABU,  	I have your letter of 23rd instant. I understand what you mean. Of 	course I saw the sentences that followed your description of Bengal 	untouchability as a greater curse. There was no logical sequence 	between that description and what you stated. By describing it as a 	greater curse you prepared the reader for the greater depths of 	degradation but not the extent in point of numbers. And then, I 
 suppose you are not aware of the fact that if the Bengal description of untouchability was applied to Madras, then the untouchables would be perhaps 90% of the Hindu population, for every non-Brahmin is practically an untouchable to a Brahmin in the Bengal sense of untouchability. There are only two divisions in the south, Brahmins and non-Brahmins. Are you aware that if a non-Brahmin looked at the food of a Brahmin, that food becomes polluted? Hence my insistence upon stepping into the opponent’s shoes and examining his argument from his own standpoint. I think that there is decidedly a meaning in the Bengal argument that untouchability in Bengal is of the mildest type and that real untouchability is confined to  the Bhangis, Mehtars and the like, who are, after all, imported. That we have to deal with every aspect of untouchability is quite true, but we shall only be able to deal with it when we are exquisitely balanced in our statements and that balance can only come if we will give even an exaggerated importance to the arguments of the opponents. Ahimsa is  a most exacting dame and it sits with the most sensitive scales noticing even an atom’s weight of himsa or want of charity. We are on the safest ground. We therefore need not be in a hurry to give them battle. It will be time enough when they reach our border. Whatever case they have, they are weakening by going about it the wrong way, but there we cannot help them. They will have to see the error themselves.
 I wonder if I have made my argument quite clear. If I have not, you must hammer away at it till I see your point or you see mine.

All your activity 	therefore has to have the opening of Guruvayur as the background. 	Public opinion should be cultivated. The sanatanists should be 	converted. We do not want the temple to be opened in the teeth of 	their opposition, but we want them to be converted. That can only 	happen if we are pure, single-minded, gentle, courteous toward them 	and show that religion is just as 
 precious to us as they claim it is to them.
 I see what happened at the Conference. Do not now wait for any instruction from the All-India Board, but make a list of the names proposed by you as the Committee and send that list to the All-India Board and a copy to me. Give a brief description of every member of the Committee.
 I am surprised that you are not getting a copy of the Harijan. I shall see to it that you get a copy. The paper is being sent to you at Shraddhanand Ashram, Payyoli. The address will now be changed. But you must enquire at the above address.

  	I have your letter. I hope that the heat which must have now 	commenced in Kathiawar was not unbearable. You have been luckier 	than before in your collections this time. If you had not been, the 	white beard would have been required to be dyed black. That it would 	have made you look much younger than you are is true, but one cannot 	have the cake and eat it also. Happily, no such transformation is 	now necessary and let the silvery beard continuously produce silver 	coins in abundance.  	Yes, Raihana came to me and presented me with a Harijan song. Let 	her stay here as long as it is possible for her to do so. What she 	requires is quiet and cool air. There she would be besieged by young 	men requiring her advice. But she has no business to act the 	grandmother whilst she is so feeble in health. Kamalmian should 	behave better, and he must get out of the middling condition. Please 	give my love to Mrs. Hamidali. May she take you away to Mussoorie 	before May, if it is possible. Devchand Parekh is greedy. You cannot 	go to Africa for collections and it is a wrong thing on principle. 	You cannot carry on anti-untouchability work by getting money from 	outside. Local work must be locally paid for. If the very large 	population of Kathiawar cannot find sufficient money for untoucha- 	bility work, it had better not be done. And after all, money is not 	the primary thing. The primary thing is character and application. 	Money won’t change the sanatanist’s heart. Untouchability 	campaign is service of God. You cannot summon Mammon to your 	assistance for rendering that service. Therefore so far as Kathiawar 	 work  is concerned your limit is Kathiawar. Love 	from us all to you all.

One cannot cultivate devotion 	to God without self-control. It was for cultivating self-control 	that Imam Sahebcame to live with me permanently. He was very eager 	to see you having grown up to be a woman leading a life of 	self-control, and it seems that you will fulfil his hope. 
 I hope the children are happy.

256,"March 	30, 1933",LETTER TO MRIDULA SARABHAI,"
           March 	30, 1933   CHI. 	MRIDU,  	Your letter came after a lapse of many days. In fact, instead of 	one, I received two letters, for, when you write to Sardar, it is as 	good as all of us receiving the letter.  	Your letters reflect your composure. May you always be as calm. Your 	experiences are good. Those who have an understanding  	of life have been able to drink draughts of joy from it. They have 	even been able to change their lives.  	Everybody is entitled to plead for Ba. You have that right all the 	more, for your love is such. You may take it that as a result of 	your pleading I have written a very long letter to Ba. But you will 	be pleased to know what Ba has conveyed through Kusum. With 	reference to my letters to her Ba commented: “Yes, Bapu  is  an 	absolute sadhu where I am concerned.” I alone know what a 	humbug I am as a sadhu. But what if it is my partiality for 	Ba which makes me write briefly to her. Surely you have heard the 	saying that a lover’s love does not wait upon civilities. But Ba 	is fully entitled to blame me. Her words may condemn me, but her 	actions make her rise and since I am holding on to her, shall I not 	rise too? So, you should go on pleading for Ba.  	It is only here that I realized that Mani has inherited  her  	dexterity from Sardar. Motilalji had been astonished by Mani’s 	dexterity. I gave her room in the Ashram to Motilalji. He commented 	at once: “I have not seen such neatness even at Anand Bhavan.” 	You should at least learn this from her. She also has an amazing 	capacity for devotion to the person whom she has chosen for it. In 	fearlessness some of your girls can rival her. So I shall not draw 	your attention to 
 it. I would have very much liked to have Mirabehn’s company for a longer period, but we must live as God makes us live.
 I always have you before my mind’s eyes. You are of course shy by nature. So I must draw your attention to it. It is true that whatever we do should be done rightly. But rightly does not mean perfectly. God alone is perfect. All beginning is imperfect. That is why it should be considered enough if what we do is done rightly. If we join our voices in Ramdhun, we may say we sing rightly. But that does not mean that we have learnt music. The same  applies  to  bhajans. We can in a little time develop the capacity. Cultivating music as an art is a different subject. You may do it with pleasure when the time for it comes. But you can do immediately the things mentioned above.
Bharati has forgotten me altogether.
 Now there is no time to write more. I do intend writing to Ambalalbhai.

 I discovered only here that Mani’s orderliness is inherited from her father. It astonished Motilalji who was given her room at the Ashram and he exclaimed that such neatness he had not seen even at Anand Bhawan. This is something which you can learn from her. And she has a wonderful capacity for service to anyone whom she chooses to serve. In courage some of you can compete with her, so I will not say anything about it.

 [Before March 31, 1933]libtech_397_footnote
 DEAR BROTHER GOPIKANT,
 Yours is to hand. Let the wells be open to one and all. Public opinion should be gathered in favour of temple-entry. Interdining is not a component part of the removal of untouchability. ‘To drink water polluted by Harijans is not a sin’—this is my personal motto. When we wish to do away with untouchability, it is not a sin to drink water ‘polluted’ by untouchables.
 Whether to drink or not to drink water is a thing of individual concern. You are ever welcome to me, if there arises any necessity.

 March 31, 1933
 
MY DEAR HORACE,
 Your long letter pleased me immensely. You should repeat the performance whenever the spirit moves you.
 You will see that I have made use in the current Harijan of one important portion of your letter.libtech_398_footnoteThe other   important  part  is  with reference to reproducing in the Harijan the views of Dr. Ambedkar and those of the sanatanists. This is not always possible. I gave much thought to it. To make the paper self-supporting, to refuse all advertisements, as the initiator of the movement to give my views as exhaustively as possible on the current happenings about Harijans, to combine all these things in one paper becomes almost an impossible task. And then the reproduction of sanatanist views and those of the Ambedkar school was unnecessary for the vast majority of readers, because they knew all the sides of the question and they had been published in the daily Press. It could then be of use only to the
 
 foreign readers, of whom there are naturally but a select few. Whether few or many they could not be neglected, and I knew that they were being well-supplied with the literature outside what could be handled by the Harijan. And this extra reading they had to  do,  whether through the Harijan or through the original sources, and I came to the conclusion that I must leave them to gather the different viewpoints through the original sources. And because I have done so, it has been possible for me, even from almost the beginning, to make the Harijan self-supporting. I have certainly taken extraordinary precaution not to give any colouring to the views of the other sides, whenever it has been necessary for me to give them. More than this I must not say.
 Thus, though I am not able to give effect, as you would wish it, to this part of your letter, you know that everything you say must produce its invisible effect upon my mind, and therefore whatever you think is worth passing on to me you should do unhesitatingly. The freer and fuller the criticism of friends and associates like you, the lighter and better will my work be, and such criticism will itself be an important part of our contribution to the Harijan cause.
 Please share this letter with C. F. Andrews, Jack Hoyland and others.
 I hope you are now so well that there is no occasion even to make any enquiry about your health.
Love to you all from us all.

There is one sentiment in your letter which I should like to 	correct. You say: “My life is a great rush and I do not get much 	time to pray and meditate.” This is what people often say, but it 	is not right. I think the Latin proverb is literally true: “To 	labour is to pray.” And if you would but labour for the sake of 	God, then no work becomes a rush. We simply give then the best of 	what is in us. Then there is no feeling of utter exhaustion, and 	when the whole life becomes a dedication, it becomes a perpetual 	prayer and meditation. For meditation you do not need a special 	time. Meditation to be true should be interwoven with every activity 	of ours. Try and test the truth of this for yourself.  	You have asked me how I am keeping. Thank you for the enquiry.

You know how best to give effect to 	it. Of course the idea of modesty differs with different countries 	and different people, and if we leave our surroundings and adopt 	others, we have to respond to them when we want to suit ourselves to 	the surroundings and identify ourselves with the people as you do 	with the Harijans.

Then Ramachandra says, “Please be writing to her if possible to 	keep silence for some hours daily and not to talk much and get 	worried.” This means that you have been talking away and if that 	is so, again Ramachandra’s warning is correct. It would not be a 	bad thing at all if you actually imposed silence on yourself for a 	few hours daily and made a conscious attempt not to talk except when 	it became absolutely necessary.

269,,NOTES,"
      
 
 MAJORITY  V. MINORITY
 A graduate from Madras sends the following quotation from
 Indian Home Rule:
 It is a superstition and an ungodly thing to believe that an act of a majority binds a minority. Many examples can be given in which acts of majorities will be found to have been wrong, and those of minorities  to have been right. All reforms owe their origin to the initiation of minorities in opposition to the majorities. If among a band of robbers, a knowledge of robbery is obligatory, is a pious man to accept the obligation? So long as the superstition that man should obey unjust laws exists, so long will their slavery exist. And a  passive resister alone can  remove such a  superstition.libtech_401_footnote and writes:
 Kindly permit me to invite your attention to the above extract from your Indian Home Rule. From this we see that you once held the opinion contained therein. However, the above opinion of your own has been trampled under foot in connection with the temple-entry question. Are we to take that the present position differs from then position held by you then? Apparently, the  position taken up by you is inconsistent. We hope to be enlightened on the subject.
It is unjust to a writer to quote against him passages from his
 writings without reference to the context. Nor should I care to defend what may appear to be my inconsistencies. I should leave the readers to judge for themselves. In this instance the quotation appears to me to propound a great truth often overlooked. Anyway I believe  in every word of it. The Temple-entry Bills do not violate the rule. They do not bind the minority to anything, they compel it to do nothing. But if a majority may not compel a minority to its will, nor may the latter compel the former. But the natural rule is that, where there is a dispute between a majority and a minority, the latter will, without admitting the rightness of the action of the former, let it have its way and, if it believes the majority in the wrong, refuse its co-operation. One of the Temple-entry Bills does that and nothing more. But I am myself  so   jealous  of  the   rights  and   wishes of   minorities   if only
 
 because I have been always, in the beginning at least, in a minority. I have, therefore, proposed, as the reader should know, a solution whereby the minority will have its wishes also respected. The other Bill takes away no rights of anybody. It simply takes the question of untouchability from the purview of the civil law. It does not interfere with the conscience or the religious observances of anybody. In fact, the Bills are designed to protect all views and one merely provides what to do in the event of a difference of opinion. Here I see no infringement of the rule enunciated in the quotation from Indian Home Rule. It shows how a minority can protect itself.
 “HARD FACTS, NOT WORDS”
 For the guidance of anti-untouchability workers I quote the following from a long and instructive letter from an English friendlibtech_402_footnotefrom whom I had invited suggestions for improving the Harijan:
 The statement of things done, of progress, from week to week, seems to be very valuable. I wish it could sometimes be expanded, and not give only the skeleton.        I have wondered if the new Society will undertake any  local
 surveys and publish the results. I should like to read paragraphs like this: ‘In .
 . . taluka according to a survey made by a member of the Society during the last fortnight, 25 village wells are being used by all castes without discrimination. Twelve of these have been opened to the untouchables since last September. But there are still 18 village wells from which the untouchables are excluded. The figures for temples are  and so on.
 Of course, I do not know if you have enough volunteers present for much work of this kind. Naturally, they will combine propaganda with their survey. You know that we, Britishers, prefer hard facts to many words—or at least, we think we do!
I venture to think that it is not only the Britisher who wants hard
 facts rather than words, that is, practice more than precept. Everyone wants deeds. Words may follow to explain the deeds sometimes. The more reports one can have of the work done and the difficulties experienced both with the sanatanists and the Harijans,  the  more useful will the Harijan become. There should be no difficulty in producing surveys such as has been suggested by the correspondent. We have nothing to conceal. If we find that in a particular area there are one hundred wells and only one has been opened to the Harijans,
 
 
 we should not be ashamed to own the fact. The shame will lie not in the confession of the fact but in its existence. The confession will be the beginning of its end. We shall learn to deal with difficulties only when we know them in their full measure.
 Harijan, 1-4-1933
 "
270,,"PROPAGANDA v.
CONSTRUCTION","
      
 The indictmentlibtech_403_footnoteby a Harijan of Harijan uplift organizations that was published in these columns some time ago has given rise to interesting correspondence.
 It is necessary in the light of that indictment and the correspondence to examine the pros and cons of propaganda and construction and to know exactly what is meant by the latter.
 Propaganda in connection with the anti-untouchability move- ment has meant an energetic distribution of literature among the caste Hindus, spreading information about untouchability and holding meetings among them. The Guruvayur referendum was essentially such propaganda. It has also meant holding Harijan conferences and the like for the purpose of telling the Harijans what is being done by the caste Hindus and what is expected of Harijans in the way  of internal reform, such as observance of the laws of  sanitation  and giving up carrion-eating and other un-Hindu practices.
 Such propaganda is undoubtedly necessary. We cannot have too much of it, if we can carry it on without creating bad blood and friction. Whilst the sanatanists are organizing, themselves and imagining Hinduism to be in danger from the reformers’ activity, the latter have to be careful. We do not want to rub the sanatanists up the wrong way. Wherever, therefore, these are in a state of rage, the reformers would do well not to hold their meetings. They are bound to contradict all falsehoods and exaggerations and themselves be scrupulously careful about what they say, write or do. Falsehood will never help any cause, certainly not religion.
 Such clean propaganda should be self-supporting. Insistence on making it self-supporting will help to keep it pure and within bounds and make it most effective. Leaflets and other literature must be paid for and may even leave a margin of profits to pay for the necessary
 
 expenses of travelling, etc. Let not the reader imagine  that  I  am writing this without any experience. On the contrary, what I am saying is based on an extensive experience gained before I became a ‘Mahatma’ and whilst I was little known in the surroundings in which God had placed me. Economy of time and money (one and the same thing ) was an instinct with me. One who has faith in his mission will find it easy enough  to enforce this golden rule of truthful propaganda.
 This does not mean that the reader pays for his leaflet in every case. That would be an ideal state. But it does mean that the central organization does not bear the cost. The local agency requiring the leaflets should pay the central organization for them.  The  local agency in its turn will see that it gets the cost repaid to it, partly by readers and partly by moneyed men interested in the distribution of leaflets. In this way the cost of propaganda will be evenly distributed and not felt by anybody. Such distribution would be a fair index to the strength and popularity of the propaganda. The various editions of the Harijan are most certainly designed as propaganda. They will have to be self-supporting or they must stop. The English. and the Bengali editions have already become so. The Gujarati is on a fair way to being so. The Hindi edition is still struggling. The Tamil edition is being published by Sjt. Ganesan without any cost to the provincial organization. The publication of these editions renders it easy for local organizations to carry on their propaganda without much or any cost. They can have all interesting and instructive information published in the various editions of the Harijan, which is their organ.
 There then remain the travelling charges of lecturers. It goes without saying that they must be all volunteers. If they are moneyed men, they often pay their own travelling expenses. Where this cannot happen, these expenses must be found by the inviting agency. And the general rule is for reception committees formed for the purpose to raise special subscriptions and defray the cost locally. Thus the permanent organizations, whether central or local, merely procure lecturers, give guidance, lend the weight of their name and influence, but, as a rule, incur no expense.
 Thus considered, the overhead charges include merely the cost of the organizing staff, rent, stationery and the travelling expenses of the Secretary. The chief officials are often wholly honorary, or are volunteers drawing just enough for their maintenance and always
 below their market price. And if the general staff consists wholly, or so far as possible, of Harijans, there will be very little money going into the pockets of caste Hindus, certainly nothing like even  ten percent of the collections of the organizations. Thus, Lala Mohanlal of the Punjab Provincial Branch says:
 Regarding the overhead charges, I have briefly to submit that, excepting the peon and the clerk, whose bill comes up to Rs. 50 p.m., no overhead charges of permanent or temporary nature have been incurred by the Punjab Board. I am working as General Secretary of the body, but I am drawing my allowances from the Servants of the People Society of which I happen to be a life member. I think this is the minimum staff required for running a provincial organization.
The bulk of the collections will, according to the scheme
 suggested above, be available for constructive work, such as  conducting preparatory schools for Harijans, giving scholarships, opening wells, etc. Here again, care has to be taken to see that most of the paid staff is composed of Harijans, or caste Hindu volunteers who have offered their services free or for less than their market price. But it must be our aim to replace all paid caste Hindus by Harijans. Then there is every chance of all but ten percent of the collections finding its way into Harijan pockets.
 And who will deny that this will be the best and the most effective propaganda both for Harijans and caste Hindus? The latter cannot but be touched by the silent, effective and dignified selfless work of caste Hindu volunteers and the consequent rise  of  the  Harijans in the social scale. And there is no reason why we should not have thousands of young men and women from among caste Hindus doing this noble service among those whom society has cruelly neglected for generations. Have we got these missionaries? I have already shown in these pages that we do not need highly educated persons. We want men and women of grit, immovable faith and character that will resist temptation.

  "
271,,STUDENTS AND VACATION,"
      
 The following is a condensed rendering of a Hindi  letter received from a student in Dehra Dun:
 In the hostel belonging to our College, hitherto  the Bhangis have taken the leavings of our dishes. But since the awakening we have stopped this practice and we have been giving them clean chapatis and dal. The Harijans are dissatisfied with this. In the leavings they get some ghee and delicacies. The students cannot afford to set apart all these things for Harijans. Then there is this difficulty. We may adhere to the new practice we have adopted, but the Harijans will continue to receive leavings of caste dinners, etc. What is now to be done? And at the same time that you answer this question, I would like you also to say how best we can use our vacation which will presently be upon us.
 The difficulty that the correspondent has raised is real. The Harijans have got so used to the leavings that they not only do not mind them but look forward to them. Not to receive them they will regard as a positive deprivation. But this tragic fact just shows the degradation both of Harijans and of caste Hindus. The students need not worry about what happens in other places. The first thing is for them to be in the right and I suggest to them that they should resolutely set apart for their sweepers a liberal amount of the food that is ordinarily cooked for them. The Dehra Dun student has raised the question of cost. I know something of the hostel life all over India. It is my conviction that the general body of students spend far more on delicacies and luxuries than they should. I know, too, that many students consider it undignified not to leave their plates with ample remains of the helpings they had. I suggest to them that to have any leavings whatsoever on their plates is undignified and a sign of disregard of the poor people. No one, least of all a student, has the right to take on his plate more than he could comfortably eat. A student has no business to multiply the delicacies and luxuries. The student life is meant for the cultivation of self-restraint in everything and if they will follow the method of self-restraint and adopt the clean habit of not having any leavings on their plates, they would find that they would effect a saving in their expenses, in spite of setting apart a
 generous portion for their sweepers from the ordinary food that may be cooked for themselves.
 And then, after having done that, I should expect them to treat the Harijans as if they were their own blood relations, speak to them kindly and tell them why it is necessary for them to give up the unclean habit of eating the leavings of other people’s plates and of making other reforms in their lives. As to the use of the vacation by students, it they will approach the work with zeal, they can undou- btedly do many things. I enumerate a few of them.
  Conduct 	night and day schools 	with just a short 	course, well conceived, 	to last 	for the period 	of the vacation.  Visit 	Harijan quarters and 	clean them, taking the 	assistance of 	Harijans if 	they would give it.  Taking 	Harijan children for 	excursions, showing them 	sights near 	their villages 	and teaching 	them how to study 	nature, and 	generally interesting 	them in 	their surroundings, 	giving them by 	the way 	a working 	knowledge of geography 	and history. Reading 	to them 	simple stories from the 	Ramayana and the 
 Mahabharata.
 Teaching 	them simple bhajans.  Cleaning 	the Harijan 	boys of all the dirt 	that they would find 	about their persons and 	giving both the 	grown-ups and 	the children simple 	lessons in hygiene.  Taking 	a detailed 	census in 	selected areas 	of the 	condition of Harijans. Taking 	medical aid to the 	ailing Harijans. 
 This is but a sample of what is possible to do among  the Harijans. It is a list hurriedly made, but a thoughtful student will, I have no doubt, add many other items.
 I have so far confined my attention to the service of Harijans, but there is a service no less necessary to be rendered to caste Hindus. The students can often in the gentlest manner possible carry the mes- sage of anti-untouchability to them in spite of themselves. There is so much ignorance which can be easily dispelled by a judicious distri- bution of clean authentic literature. The students can make a survey of those who are for abolishing untouchability and who are against and, whilst they are making this survey, they may take note of wells, scho- ols, ponds and temples open to Harijans and of those closed to them.
 If they will do all these things in a methodical and persistent manner, they will find the results to be startling. Every student should keep a log-book in which he should enter the details of his work, and at the end of the vacation a comprehensive but brief report of the results of their labours could be prepared and sent by them to the Servants of Untouchables Society of their Province. Whether other students accept all or any of the suggestions made here, I shall expect my correspondent to give me a report of what he and his associates have done.

272,,272. ‘THIS FIGHT IS NECESSARY’,"
 The reader will appreciate the following instructive letter that Gurudev wrote on reading mine to Boyd Tucker on the place of temples, churches and mosques in religion in reply to his letter to me.libtech_404_footnote
 
DEAR MAHATMAJI,
 It is needless to say that I do not at all relish the idea of divinity being enclosed in a brick-and-mortar temple for the special purpose of exploitation by a particular group of people. I strongly believe that it is possible for the simple-hearted people to realize the presence of God in the open air, in a surrounding free from all artificial obstruction. We know a sect in Bengal, illiterate and not dominated by Brahminical tradition, who enjoy a perfect freedom of worship profoundly universal in character. It was the prohibition for them to enter temples that has helped them in their purity of realization.
 The traditional idea of Godhead and conventional forms of worship hardly lay emphasis upon the moral worth of religious practices; their essential value lies in the conformity to custom which creates in the minds of the worshippers an abstract sense of sanctity and sanction. When we argue with them in the name of justice and humanity, it is contemptuously ignored, for, as I have said, the moral appeal of the cause has no meaning for them and you know that there are practices and legends connected with a number of our sectarian creeds and practices which are ignoble and irrational.
 There is a tradition of religion connected with temple worship, and though such traditions can be morally wrong and harmful yet they cannot
 
 merely be ignored. There the question comes of changing them, of widening their range and character. There can be differences of opinion with regard to the methods to be adopted. From the point of view of the trustees of traditions, they are acting according to an inherent sense of propriety in preserving them as they are, in keeping the enjoyment of idol-worship in temples for exclusive groups of people. They not only deny the right of such worship to Christians and Mahomedans but to sections of their own community. Particular temples and deities are their own property and they keep them locked up in an iron chest. In this they are acting according to traditional religion which allows them such freedom, rather enjoins them to act in this manner. A reformer, in dealing with such morally wrong traditions, cannot adopt coercion and yet, as in fighting with other wrong and harmful customs, he must exert moral force and constantly seek to rectify them. This fight is necessary. I do not think Tucker makes this point clear.
 As to the Santiniketan prayer-hall, it is open to all peoples of every faith. Just as its doors do not shut out anybody, so there is nothing in the simple form of worship which excludes peoples of different religions. Our religious service could as well take place under the trees, its truth and  sacredness would not at all be affected but perhaps enhanced by such a natural environment. Difficulties of climate and season intervene, otherwise I do not think separate buildings are really necessary for prayer and communion with the Divine.
 I have sent a poem1 for the Harijan—translating it from one of my recent Bengali writings. I do hope it is one in spirit with the ideals of the Harijan, which I read with much pleasure and interest. There can be no more hopeful sign for India than the fact that her repressed humanity is waking up as  a result of the great fast.
 With loving regards,
     Harijan, 	1-4-1933  Yours 	sincerely,  RABINDRANATH 	TAGORE

273,,KABULI ZULUMlibtech_405_footnote,"
    
 The training in patient endurance of the Harijan has to be very generously supplemented by inviting Muslims of piety and influence to meet the Kabulis and point out to them that the taking of exorbitant rates of interest and the use of force for its recovery is contrary to law, morals and Islam and that, therefore, they should either [sic] be satisfied with the ordinary interest and recourse to law, if there is failure to pay. Similar educative propaganda has to be carried on among the Bania money-lender who charges the same unconscionable rate of interest as his Kabuli brother.

274,,ANTI-UNTOUCHABILITY IN BIHAR,"
    
 The following report has been received from Bihar of the work done to the middle of March.libtech_406_footnote
 It is surely not enough for the local Committees to state that certain wells having been opened to Harijans were closed. It is necessary to state what steps have been taken to mend matters. In so far as a pure water-supply is concerned, it seems to me that it is the first duty of every Committee to make a rapid survey  of the conditions as to water-supply and, where it is wholly inadequate, to take steps to redress the grievance.

  "
275,,PROTECTIVE CLOTHING,"
    
 The Home Office in England published for official use a carefully prepared pamphlet entitled Protective Clothing for Women and Girl Workers Employed in Factories and Workshops. I am obliged for the pamphlet to Sjt. Hiralal Shah’s industrious zeal. It contains different patterns of protective clothing for a well-classified list of employments, and it states that protective clothing has been found to be required for safeguarding the worker against accident or injury to health, or for securing her comfort and convenience in her work, or for protecting her ordinary clothing against damage caused by the materials, machinery, etc., used in the process in which she is  employed, or resulting from the conditions under which the work has to be carried [on]. It goes on to state that in the great majority of cases the need for protective clothing arises from one or other of the following causes:
 dusty 	or dirty processes, working 	about machinery, climbing 	ladders, etc., use 	of acids or 	caustic liquids, wet 	processes, excessive heat, exposure 	to weather, etc. 
 Then follows an instructive but brief description of every type of clothing recommended. There are seven such types designed for 31 employments, coming under the headings I have already given. The pamphlet is profusely illustrated.
 I mention this only in order to show the care with which the lives of employees are regarded by the Government in England and to drive the truth home that such meticulous care is exercised in devising methods of not only protecting employees engaged in dirty or injurious trades but also of protecting the public. How much more care is necessary in this climate for protecting the so-called untouchables engaged in dusty or dirty processes and for protecting also the public from the contamination caused by the workers in such employment becoming living carriers of dust and dirt! Their untouchability in no way protects society. On the contrary, a false
 sense of security aggravates the danger of contagion or infection and this aggravation is doubled by the fact that such employees, being neglected by society, become themselves so inured to insanitation that the surroundings in which they live become positive factories for disseminating dirt and disease. Hence the necessity for adopting without delay the very simple reform advocated by Sjt. Hiralal Shah. If we did not take a crooked view of untouchability, we should go to the quarters where the untouchables reside; we would begin our study of their conditions by entering our sanitary closets with our eyes wide open. Then society will not consider any cost too great for initiating and completing the reform, by ensuring the necessary measure of sanitation not only in the closets but also in the quarters inhabited by Harijans and by providing protective clothing and conveniences for washing and change.

  	I thank you for your letterlibtech_411_footnoteof the 15th ultimo. I kept it by me all these days in 	order to read your argument. It is instructive but not convincing. 	Varnadharma is not a man-made law but it is a law     
 governing the soul. Man may break it as often as he likes, as he is doing, but he pays the penalty for it. Obedience to it sets free a vast amount of energy for the development of the substantial self, whereas disregard of it involves the expenditure of an amount of energy far too much for the result achieved. You have got to demolish not the varnadharma itself, but its inverted form. I am at one with you in doing so, but I have endeavoured to show that true varnadharma is a great discovery of Hinduism. I can be no party to the attempt to destroy it because the form in which we see it today is serious [sic].

  	I  kept  your  letterlibtech_413_footnotelibtech_414_footnoteall  these   days   without   acknowledgement, because 	I did not want to send you a reply without having read your letter 	which you have had so carefully prepared. I must thank you for all 	the labours that you have given to the task. The texts you have 	quoted are not unfamiliar to me nor the meanings that you have 	given. The difference arises from the application. I observe that 	there is a fundamental difference between you and me, if I may for 	the moment put myself, a layman, side by side with one so learned as 	you. That difference is in the interpretation. I look at the 	Shastras as one organic whole. You take isolated texts and prove 	your point. That method is as ancient as the human race, but I hold 	it to be altogether erroneous. It has led to the formation of 	innumerable sects and rival divisions without bringing us nearer to 	God or Truth. I will not therefore trouble you any more with my 	questions but will naturally always welcome anything you might wish 	to say.  	I note also what you say about ahimsa and truth. Here again the same 	difficulty faces me. I can agree with the position you have taken up 	and yet defend my own without the slightest difficulty and on the 	strength of the very Shastras with which you are undoubtedly so 	familiar.

 I read your letters to your father. Every word in them bespeaks the purity of your heart. But you are altogether on the wrong path, as you have forsaken your duty. It would be considered a breach of trust if a person appointed to do one thing leaves it and does another. An agent commissioned to buy vegetables has no authority to return with a precious stone, though the latter is more valuable than the former. A jewel cannot serve the same purpose as a vegetable. As you are still a student and went abroad specially for study, you ought not to marry Elizabeth even if she is as good-looking as Rambha and as faithful as Savitri. To fall in love while one is a student is against dharma. If you understand this, wake up from the spell under which you have fallen. If, however, you think that it is your dharma to cling to your error, I am helpless.

 Your letters are received regularly. I have written to Amina. It will certainly be good if she gives up tobacco. If she can, let her prolong the fast. She will definitely benefit by it. After one breaks the fast only fruit should be given for a few days, afterwards milk and fruit. You may consider unboiled milk also.
 Jamna and Chimanlal will certainly be benefited. There  can never be any harm.
 But now I am a little worried about you. You should improve your own health. If you only interest yourself in other patients, you will not benefit either. Then you need a little more study and experience of nature cure. I want that you should familiarize yourself with the experience of all such centres in India. I know most of them.  I don’t know whether you are well acquainted with Gaurishanker. You have also to see whether you have mastered yogasanas. It is my desire to exact a good deal of work from you after you have gained the necessary proficiency. But we should not be hasty. For the present, you should observe and treat the patients there. This will take quite a bit of your time. You should also keep writing to me about the condition of your health. I am not concerned about weight. It is enough if the bowels are cleared regularly and you feel fresh and energetic.

Cowards have never produced results. Those who are indifferent to results but remain engrossed in their work become instrumental in

I have made no effort to put the scheme just as it is before the reader. I have only given a summary. I have suggested that the scheme deserves consideration. My work is at present limited. I place many things before the readers. Whether to implement them or not is up to the men and women workers. It is the author’s responsibility to take care of his scheme after I have more or less introduced it [to the public]. At present I can do no more than this.
 There was much else in Shri Hiralal’s letter. I have quoted only the essential part of it. Those who are interested in this scheme should write to Shri Hiralal and obtain full information and should then do what they can to implement his scheme.

 WRATH OF HARIJANSlibtech_427_footnote
 How can your anger be pacified? I do not quite understand what your demand is. The chief executives of the Harijan Sevak Sangh are caste Hindus because it is for them to atone for their sins. Harijans can most certainly form their own organizations and they have been doing it. They should try to provide guidance to the institutions manned by caste Hindus. Ultimately, it is for the caste Hindus to pass the test at the hands of Harijans. God alone knows whether or not they will. The caste Hindus’ burden of sin is so great that they are beyond redemption; who can save them now? If their sins have accumulated so much, they are most likely to meet their doom. But tell me what else can the caste Hindus do except regarding the Harijans like themselves and how can they make amends to the Harijans who do not regard themselves as Hindus? And, pray, what kind of amends?
 IS NON-CO-OPERATION NOT APPLICABLE TO HARIJANS? libtech_428_footnote
 I have your letter. Convey the following to your friend: No one is surprised that the food accepted by the stomach of a sturdy man is not acceptable to the stomach of a delicate man. It is sheer lack of understanding to apply the great rule to the absolutely uneducated when it can be applied only to the sensible. All rules are not equally applicable at all times and places and to all men. Such rules could hardly be as many as the fingers of one’s hand. Many other rules have to be modified according to differences of time, place and individuals. If we thought in terms of the good society, we would realize that applying to Harijans or their children the rule we have applied to ourselves is likely to prove grossly unjust. The friend should adhere to his position and firmly participate in the giving of scholarships, etc., to Harijan children.
 
 
 WHY A NEW NAME?libtech_429_footnote
 Your argument that all Hindus, whether touchable or untouch- able, should be known as Hindus is correct. But so long as untoucha- bility is not wiped out, why should not our brethren who are regarded as untouchables be addressed by a sweet rather than a bitter name? A wayward son can refer to his mother as his “dad’s woman”, whereas, an obedient son will address her as “honoured mother”.

  	I have your letter. You did well in writing it. It is a good one. I 	cannot reply to you in detail today. Though the letter is good, it 	shows a pride unworthy of a woman who claims to be a brahmacharini. 	Remember the story of Narad. The moment he felt proud of his 	brahmacharya, he fell. One who aspires to observe 	brahmacharya relies only on God, and hence he is always 	humble. He never trusts himself. Anybody who is incapable from birth 	of feeling passion is not a human being. Such a person is either 	God, or lacks the power which makes a man a man or a woman a woman. 	In other words, he or she is an incomplete human being, is diseased. 	How can God be proud? Is a stone proud of being a stone? A diseased 	person should not be proud of being so. A man or a woman  can  	cultivate  the strength to control his or her passion and put the 	power so conserved to better use. But as soon as he or she becomes 	proud  of such strength, it will be lost. How do you know to what 	extent the power of brahmacharya which you may have in you is 	being wasted? Your brahmacharya is certainly not perfect. 	Find out the  natural truth about you. If you never feel passion, 	are you a goddess? A goddess would be a different kind of being from 	what you are. You are no goddess, and I don’t think that you are 	diseased, since  you  get monthly periods. Examine yourself and 	write to me again.  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 10332.

292,"April 2, 1933",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
    
 April 2, 1933
 
CHI. NARANDAS,
 The clock has just struck three and, after cleansing the teeth, I have sat down to write this letter.
 You seem to feel a little defeated. That will not do. You must have observed that I tell everybody in my letters that they should do nothing mechanically unless they are convinced about it. One should accept a thing either with one’s heart or with one’s reason. One can accept a thing with the heart only if one has faith. But in either case one feels satisfied and happy. When reason does not understand a thing nor does the heart accept it, one feels discontented and slowly loses strength and energy. Though such a person works day and night without rest, his work is not well done and he becomes weaker and weaker and falls ill. This does not happen when one does work in which one has faith. ‘What can I do? I know that all this is not right, but I have to do it out of respect for my elders.’ This is not faith, but false civility. According to our definition of truth, it is also a form of untruth. This is the feeling which your letter [of the 31st] gives. Don’t do anything because Narahari or I ask you to do it. Do a thing only if you are convinced that it is right. You are completely free to reject all suggestions of Narahari, for the final responsibility is yours. Many of Narahari’s suggestions appeal to me, that is, they seem good on paper. If you feel that some of them are already being acted upon or that some others don’t deserve to be accepted, you ought to take no action about them. You should try to explain your point of view gently to Narahari, and, if he does not see it, you should be patient and have faith that he will see it in the end or that you will see your error. Meanwhile, you should not let estrangement grow between him and you and neither of you should suspect the other of deliberate hostility. In some matters everything depends on one’s method of work. You should understand Narahari’s point of view.  He  is particular only about two things. He is open-hearted, hard-working and sensible. He has no control over his temper and is incapable of understanding certain things. But he doesn’t worry about those things either. He is good at heart and harbours no resentment. One should be
 patient with such a person. You should, therefore, try to understand his suggestions patiently and reason with him. Do not get upset or lose your peace of mind.
 Read the letter which I have written to Parachure Shastri. I have written in it about his diet. He should now start working.
 I sent a wire to Jivrajlibtech_430_footnotelibtech_431_footnoteat once yesterday.  I  will  write  to  him today. We should bear all things. Just now I am probing the depths of mental leprosy. This case of physical leprosy,  therefore,  does not affect me much.
 Umedram wants to learn music. Make the necessary arrangements for that and then arrange the rest of his programme of work.
Invite Marybehn to come again.
 Personally I don’t feel at all that Kusum is improving. Did you forward to Talwalkar my letter to him? I myself have no faith in his method of treating consumption. I would prefer Sharma’s treatment if he agrees to come. Now Purushottam is our Sharma. I don’t want to load him with much work till he is sure of his health. It is desirable that he should undertake more responsibility only after  his  experiment on himself has succeeded. Otherwise his health would break down. We will make no change before I get Talwalkar’s reply. Nor should we upset Kusum. Talwalkar is a gentleman. He is also an experienced physician. Many patients put complete faith in him and remain under his treatment till the end. Quite a few of them die, but some recover too. It is the same with other physicians. If, therefore, we lose somebody by trusting to Talwalkar completely, we will not blame him. I have only expressed my own lack of faith in his method of treatment. I have faith only in nature-cure. When a case requires an operation, we certainly require a surgeon, but that happens in very few cases. If you have thought further about Kusum’s case and have any suggestions to make, write to me. Get from Talwalkar his reply to my letter as early as possible.
 Don’t burden Purushottam with responsibility for more than four patients at a time.

I 	send you with this a letter for Ranjit Pandit. He has gone there. You 	may give it to him if you want to and if he is there.  	Who is Rana? His suggestions seem very bad and your criticism is 	fully justified. Stick to your stand, and don’t mind it if, in 	consequence, you fail in your aim. I see no objection to a temple 	being built even if the funds are collected from the reformers. If 	such a temple is built and is maintained properly on religious 	lines, it can become a great centre. The site must be good and the 	men in charge of it should be persons of character. We do need a few 	model temples.  	Sarupbehn gives an unfavourable account of the Bhangi quarters at 	Rajkot. Are they quite so bad? Wouldn’t the municipality do 	anything to improve them?

  	I wrote one letterlibtech_439_footnotelibtech_440_footnoteto you today morning. You will probably get it before 	this. What you write about . . .libtech_441_footnotelibtech_442_footnoteand 	 .  .  . libtech_443_footnoteis 	a half-truth. Everybody makes mistakes. We should not be upset if 	somebody makes one, but we are bound to feel unhappy when a person 	hides his mistake and it is brought to light in spite of him, and 	then he puts up an unworthy defence. If we do not feel unhappy, we 	shall never find a way of preventing such incidents. If we assume 	that such things will always happen and do nothing to prevent them, 	that will mean destruction of society. We must, therefore, do what 	we can to prevent them. We will do so only if we are shocked by such 	incidents. We can say that one should not feel pain or get angry for 	things which don’t matter, and I think you also mean only that. If 	you mean anything more, I am sure that you are wrong. If some other 	word is suggested in place of “pain” or “shock”, I might 	accept it. But your letter seems to  spring  from  mohalibtech_444_footnotelibtech_445_footnote,  I  cannot  explain  how.  I  cannot  say whether the 	word moha is correct. I will be satisfied if you understand 	what I mean. I 	have already admitted the mistake which I made.  	What I want you to show is simplicity of heart, tenderness, 	humility, patience, forbearance and generosity towards  others.  You 	can show these things only if you come down from the sky to the 	earth. When will you begin to feel that you are nothing? Is it 	proper to bow down to Mother Earth every day and then kick her every 	day? If our prayer to her is sincere, we should make ourselves mere 	particles of dust and learn to suffer the kicks of the world. Mother 	Earth then will not feel our feet, as we shall have become ash, 	though still alive. “Scatter the dust of separateness”, as the 	poet says.  	I have still a stock of the slivers sent by you. It was not your 	fault that they contain rough particles. The fault was partly that 	of the carding-bow and partly of the cotton. If you had carded the 	cotton       
 still further, the fibres would have become weak. Other slivers do not yield very fine yarn, but they contain fewer particles.
 I am very glad that you have taken Parachure Shastri’s son in your hand.
You advised Shanta well. She may now do whatever she likes.

 The suggestion is not for building a new temple and throwing it open, but for permitting the entry of Harijans to one of the four which already exist.libtech_451_footnoteI do wish that you should do this much if possible. I am also of the view that it should be published in the Gazette that the Bhavnagar Ruler does not approve of discrimination against anybody in regard to schools, etc. There is some such law in your State. It will be enough if this principle is explicitly declared in it. It can be  enforced only to the extent that the people are ready to co-operate. I do not wish that you should force the people to do anything. All that I want is that the State subjects should be informed of the policy of the Ruler, and that not orally but through a legal declaration. In any case I do not wish to kill the goose that lays golden eggs. For my part I want no eggs at all. The milk of a milch goat would satisfy me and I would not complain even if the goat occasionally hit me with  its horns.
Do take care of your health.

  	I have your letter. I was sorry to read your announcement, but I 	cannot help saying that your fast was an utterly uncalled for and an 	ignorant performance. I hope it has left you none the worse for it 	bodily. There can be no spiritual gain from such an ill-conceived 	fast like yours. Surely you had no data to enable you to come to the 	conclusion that the defeat suffered by Sjt. Deorukhker was due to 	the sins of caste Hindus. I do not know the cause of his defeat but 	I am quite sure that you could not know them either. And why should 	you take it for granted that every Harijan candidate for election 	should succeed, whether he deserves or not? It would be a terrible 	test for caste Hindus if you expected them in open elections 	invariably to elect a Harijan candidate when one offers himself for 	election. What therefore in my opinion you need to do is to do real 	penance for the unjustified penance you have done and that penance 	consists in never again to do a single thing thoughtlessly.

SHARMA,  	I have your letter and I am glad you are coming at last to the 	Ashram. Do please bring your child, and I shall be delighted if the 	place is found to be suitable both by you and him. Narandas warns me 	that the principal patients are just now out of the Ashram. I do not 	mind it at all. There are many things for you to examine and see 	from    
 the nature-cure standpoint, and there is the common complaint about constipation which you would be able to deal with.
 I am glad you have driven out Amtussalaam’s superstition that she is suffering from T. B. She has a very vivid imagination and she conjures up evil where there is none.
 I want from your presence in the Ashram much more than mere treatment of a few patients. A firm believer in nature-cure myself, I would like to find in you a kindred spirit given up wholly to truthful research without any mental reservations. And if I can get such a man with also a belief in the Ashram ideals, I could regard it as a great event. I know you too are approaching the visit in that light. You will therefore please make yourself thoroughly at home at the Ashram and study it in every detail. It is my belief that a nature-cure man should be able to vanquish the climate. Millions of human beings ought to be able to live healthy life by understanding the laws of adaptability to the climate in which they find themselves. They cannot have changes that rich men can afford and I cannot imagine nature to be so cruel as to be partial to the rich and indifferent to the poor. On the contrary I believe in the Biblical saying that “it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven”, and another Biblical verse says that “the Kingdom of Heaven is within you”. Therefore I have always imagined that laws of nature are simple and understandable and capable of being followed easily by the millions.
 I would ask you therefore to approach the Ashram with the set purpose of discovering the means of preserving or regaining health in the ordinary Indian climate.
 Yours sincerely,
 BAPU

 The morning post has already been dispatched. I got your letter after it was sent.
I send with this a copy of the letter which I have written to
 Dr. Sharma. You will know my views from that letter. You will also find in it answers to all your questions. I, therefore, don’t write more about the subject in this letter. Your question regarding Parachure Shastri is good. This is the difference between his and Raojibhai’s case. Parachure Shastri belongs to the Ashram. He had come to live in the Ashram as a regular member. He intended to stay at least for three years, but circumstances obliged him to leave. I, therefore, thought that it was our duty to support him. But any number of outsiders like Raojibhai may wish to live in the Ashram. I am afraid that we cannot take in all such persons.

 April 3/4 /933
 MY DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS,
 I have your two letters. I have been watching the progress of the Harijan Sevak. Of course there is a steady improvement. There has to be a choice made, even of my writings; not all that I write for the English Harijan can be fit for reproduction in the Hindi edition, and I quite agree with you that what is reproduced should have the Hindi flavour about it; and not be a mere mechanical translation. I will bear your remarks in mind and will not send translations from here. Of course I want Viyogi Hari to do that. It was only because he was just now unable to cope with it that I began to translate here instead of sending the articles to Kashinath and Ramdas Goud. I quite agree with you that there should be some stories from Sanskrit or other sources, and poems too, if they are original and have first-class merit. I shall be entirely satisfied if you will look through the Harijan Sevak week to week as you have been doing recently.
 I understand now what to do about the transfer for funds to you. Besides the money lying at the Press, I have received an anonymous donation of Rs. 500 today to be used for the cause at my discretion.libtech_463_footnoteI am having that too transferred to the Board to be used subject to the donor’s condition.
 
 I am glad you have definitely decided to have the operation performed. I would be still gladder when you give me the definite date.
I understand what you say about the controversy in Bengal.
 You ask me to send a copy of the Harijan to the Bengal Secretariat for His Excellency the Governor. I have a great deal of hesitation in doing so, for I do not know him personally. If therefore I send a copy to one, I should send to all the Secretariats, but that is not what you want me to do, and that is not what is necessary either, as it appears to me. I think I told you that Lord Reading and also Lady Reading used specially to subscribe to Young India. These big functionaries do not hesitate to express their wants, and it would look officious to supply them in anticipation. But you know the Governor of Bengal, and after all, the Harijan is being published under the aegis of the Central Board. It would be therefore quite proper for you to send a paper in your capacity as President to any of your big acquaintances.
 Yours sincerely,

MY DEAR PREM NATH,
 I have a copy of your letter of 27th February. My guidance consists in a radical change in outlook.libtech_464_footnotelibtech_465_footnotelibtech_466_footnoteWhat I would like you to do is to satisfy the requirements set forth in my article in the Harijan on the ‘disposal of carcasses’libtech_467_footnotelibtech_468_footnote. If you have not read it, you should procure a copy and read it. That would mean your learning the A B C of treatment. You have to begin by handling the carcass at the spot where it is found and treating it, not in a central depot but in the village near by, knowing what to do with every part of the carcass. When you have succeeded in doing this, the second step will be to take charge of the
 
 hides that have at least gone through the primary cure, but this is a programme for which you are hardly prepared. If you are, you will certainly be my man.

It will be true enough when I make 	a general statement. ‘I’m all right’, but that general 	statement will cover the untruth, namely, the fact of the bad elbow. 	That will only come out of a careful cross-examination of me unless 	I said, ‘I’m all right, but for a bad elbow’. There is a great 	passage in the most ancient and the simplest and I think the 	shortest of the Upanishads.

April 4, 1933
  	I hope you got my letterlibtech_477_footnotesent to you as soon as I learnt that you had reached 	the Ashram. I have now got your own letter. In a few days’ time I 	expect you to write to me in Hindi, for there is not much difference 	between Marathi, Hindi and Gujarati. They are all sister languages; 	a large part of the vocabulary is common to them and it is easy 	enough to detect a similarity in grammar.  	You will resist the temptation to give. I would ask you to be in no 	hurry. You have gone to the Ashram for the purpose of taking, 	therefore quietly and persistently take in all that the Ashram has 	to give and when that has been done, begin giving by all means, and 	you will find that you are able to take much more than you had 	expected. Do not combine giving and taking for the time being, 	rather believe that you cannot fail to be unconsciously giving while 	you are taking properly. I am most anxious that for the time at 	least you should bury yourself in the Ashram, and when you have 	either assimilated enough of the Ashram atmosphere and attitude or 	rejected it as unassimilable or unsuitable, you should proceed to 	the next stage, and in all you do whilst you are in the Ashram, I 	would like you to be guided implicitly by Narandas. That seems to me 	to be the best way of taking the most out of any institution.  	I had seen the rough draft of your reply to Dr. Ambedkar’s 	statement. There was not much in it and in no case could I have 	published it, seeing that Dr. Ambedkar’s statement was not 	published in the Harijan. The draft was so roughly drawn that 	I did not know that you would want it back. I think I destroyed it 	after having read it.  	I am surprised at what you tell me about Sind, because there there 	are very staunch workers. Jamshed Mehta is a host in himself. 	Narayandas Bechar has given himself to the Harijan cause and there 	are several others. The Harijans in Karachi are better housed and 	better looked after than elsewhere. Of course there is room for 	improvement, but that would be so in every case. However if you will 	send me concrete proposals I would gladly forward them to Jamshed 	Mehta. I hope that you have completely thrown off the headache you 	had in the beginning.  Yours 	sincerely,  BAPU  From 	a photostat: G.N. 791; also S.N. 20826

323,"April 	4, 1933",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
  	I enclose herewith a cutting from the Sanatani dated 12th 	March. I wonder whether the cutting represents your views. If it 	does, you are bound fearlessly to express them even though they may 	be contrary to mine. I know full well that mutual regard ought not 	to mean always identity of views. If therefore I discovered that you 	hold different views from mine, my regard for you will not suffer. 	What binds us is a relentless pursuit after Truth at any cost.  	Do you know which Bombay temple is referred to?libtech_478_footnoteI  should like to enquire. I know that several 	temples that were opened during the fast have since been closed to 	the Harijans again, but I have not known of a temple in Bombay or 	elsewhere deserted by Brahmins because it has been opened to 	Harijans. Such threats were uttered no doubt, but they were not 	carried out, except in the case of individuals; at least such is my 	information. But we have simply to know the truth and base our 	action accordingly. I would therefore like to enquire more fully 	when I get the name of the temple. As it is, I have already written 	to the Secretary of the Bombay Board if he knows of any such temples 	referred to by the writer in the Bengali Prabartak.  	There are other statements which are open to question, but they can 	be regarded as matters of opinion. Therefore I have not commented on 	them, but I have underlined the passage, for your attention.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 20829         April 	4, 1933  CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	The packet of letters which I despatched this morning was a large 	one as usual. Compared to it, this will be a much smaller one. I 	despatched the packet in the morning because the letters were 	urgent.    
 I did not find Dhanvant Raka’s letter which you say was  included.
I return Narahari’s letter with this.
 This is my view regarding guests. Even if every guest is given a copy of the rules to be observed by him, he should be given a seat by the side of a responsible inmate of the Ashram. The latter should take away from him his dish for cleaning and also clean the spot where he is asked to sit. These two things should be left to the guest only after he has himself started doing them. About the food also, the neighbour should explain to him that the general menu of the Ashram contains no rice, but that it is included in the special menu and he can ask to be served according to either. If there is only one solitary person who wants rice, he need not be asked. As soon as a guest arrives, somebody should elicit from him his special requirements and as many of them should be provided as possible.
 Potatoes and ratalu should not as a rule be served as vegetables.  I would have them served only in place of bread or rice. They are mostly starch. Vegetable means any green which contains no starch. If people would agree, I would make it a rule to serve rice onl to persons who are ill. The quantity of dal served should be very small. Rice is not necessary at all. Those who get milk need very little quantity of dal . There is no doubt that our diet contains an excess of starch. It is being proved day by day that the body needs very little starch. But we cannot force this reform on unwilling people, and in any case we should watch the result.
 We should not tolerate snacks being bought from the market. But we need the fullest co-operation of the families to put a stop to this practice. If people went and saw for themselves how these things were prepared, they would never eat them again.
 You should insist on the children sleeping for eight hours at night.
 I believe that it is not proper to withhold a meal by way of punishment. I myself, though, have been guilty of ordering such punishment. I am also becoming more and more convinced that there should be no physical punishment either. I have no doubt that the very fact that the need for punishment is felt bespeaks our imperfection. We must learn how to teach without the use of any form of punishment, and we can do that only if we refrain from punishing even in extreme cases.
 The suggestion about the dictionary should be immediately implemented. A copy should be kept not only in the library but also in the office. Everybody in the Ashram should form the habit of consulting it. This will mean some expense, but it is worth incurring.

 even then I generally penned something at the bottom. Sometimes possibly that was also not done. That is the reason why I am confused. You have certainly the right to complain and even be angry if you do not hear from anyone of us. You ought to feel sure that we shall never, for whatever reasons, refrain from writing to you and if we do you should know that it must be through accident.
 We are all well here. Father has resumed his study of Sanskrit. I would not say that he is making rapid progress but he is doing quite well. He makes constant efforts to remember what he has learnt so far. Dahyabhai generally comes every week to see us.
 My hand is as it was but it does not interfere with my work. Mahadev is in good health. Chhaganlal Joshi is also well. If you need good slivers we can send some from here, as we receive plenty of them. We had news of you from Mridula and also from Kamaladevi and Lilavati. You have created a good impression on all of them. Ba and Mirabehn are all right. Mirabehn writes to me every week. At present Kakasaheb is here and helps with the Harijan work.

DEAR BROTHER,
 I am fascinated by the love both of you show for your children. But I think your anxiety for Mridula is unnecessary and harmful. Her sacrifice and her courage should delight you so that she can feel reassured. But your anxiety cannot but affect her mind. I have been impelled to write this because all your actions are guided by reason and you do nothing without proper thought. I know  that  reason cannot control our feelings. But this is not wholly true. Man can succeed to a certain extent if he tries to fight back feelings before they assail him. Leave Mridu under God’s protection. Her strength of character is her real shield. She will surmount all difficulties. It is the earnest wish of us all that you should have this much faith and save yourself from anxiety.
All of you will of course go to Mussoorie.

    THE 	SUPERINTENDENT 	YERAVDA 	CENTRAL PRISON 	POONA  CHI. 	MRIDU,  April 	4, 1933 
  	I dictated a postcard very hurriedly yesterday. Today I  am writing 	this to reply to your question.Love knows what the other person 	wishes and whenever it is proper and possible fulfils that wish. Our 	wishes are not always proper. Pure love will not feel hurt when 	things do not happen as wished. you should not take it as want of 	love but as good intention. This does not mean that we can never 	feel hurt 
 by anything at all. But the hurt is momentary and does not diminish love in the least. Indeed, it strengthens love. Here I have only cited my own experience. But it is not just my experience. In short, as one’s love becomes purer the need for words becomes less. If this did not happen, love would become a burden; it would certainly never be so wide in scope.With regard to music also, learn from Mani. She has no voice of course. But she realized that if she waited till she acquired a voice, the time for reciting Ramanama would slip by. If one can learn to sing in tune with others, one can at least recite Ramanama. The voice is trained by reciting Ramanama a couple of times and singing a few bhajans.

 Prabhudas has written to me that I should talk to Satyawati  before marriage. I do not think it is necessary. Her parents may feel that we are demanding too much.

331,"April 	4, 1933",LETTER TO T. TITUS,"
          MY 	DEAR TITUS,          April 	4, 1933 
  	Your letter is full and very good. I shall read your report with 	avidity. It may be sent to me by registered post and I shall return 	it after reading; that would save time and labour.  	You must have read literature about the qualities of unfired milk 	and how long such milk remains in an eatable condition without 	needing to be boiled. I have simply suggested its being put in an 	air-tight bottle or an air-tight vessel and wrapped in wet cloth 	under the belief that milk so kept remains for 12 hours or so 	without altering its quality, and if your reading confirms my 	belief, you should     
 popularize the use of unfired milk in the Ashram, and begin to preserve it in the manner suggested by me. You begin the milking early. Some of the milk is not used till 10.30 or 11 o’clock. If  therefore it is taken in an unfired condition, it has got to be preserved against atmospheric changes. And I think that the milkmen or milkmaids should be frequently watched and taught to wash  the udders, etc., in a thorough manner.
 My recollection of the Bangalore Dairy is that the animals were taken to a special open place for the purpose of milking. Was that not so? I have a notion that Col. Smith told me that it was better to take the animals to a free open space for milking. If this is a good practice, and I think it is, we ought to adopt it. But you know better. I do not want to give you more work than is absolutely necessary. I do want our dairy to be a first-class model dairy of its kind. We cannot go in for expensive methods, but we must go in for all the methods that would ensure, through methodical labour and meticulous care, cleanliness and purity of milk. What is the lowest yield required from a cow to make her self-supporting? And what is the cost?
 Now about homoeopathy. I must confess that without any specific cause I have never been able to take kindly to it, though some of my friends have often recommended it to me. I have noticed too that these friends themselves at critical moments have given up homoeopathy and gone to allopathy. Though I should like to believe to the contrary I am driven to the conclusion that allopathy, although it has great limitations and much superstition about it, is still the most universal and justifiably the most popular system; Allopathy provides opening medicines, ointments for a variety of boils and eruptions, disinfectants for various situations and includes surgery of a most wonderful type. It is an all-inclusive system. It can well include homoeopathy, biochemistry and the latest nature-cures. If therefore allopathy rids itself of the worship of mammon, which has overtaken most human activities, and could exclude vivisection and other practices which I call black, and liberally took advantage of the new methods discovered by lay people, it would become all-satisfying and quite inexpensive.
 Having said this, if you have an accurate knowledge of homoeopathy and can easily spare the time necessary for treatment, I do not mind your introducing it in the Ashram subject of course to consultation with Narandas and the other responsible people in the
 Ashram. I would love to think that we were independent of outside medical assistance or that it was only rarely that we have to trouble our medical friends. My ideal is to find whatever alleviation we want in the Ashram itself. It pains me when any of us have to go out for medical relief or treatment or to call in medical assistance. We may never reach that perfect state, but the nearer the approach to it the better for us. I would therefore be pleased if you could even minimize the occasions for seeking medical help from outside. Tell me what treatments you would give to Kusum, Jamna, Chimanlal and last but not least Parachure Shastri. These are all typical cases.
 Yours sincerely,

 The Sanatani I have been getting regularly. You need not therefore send it to me. Who is the editor? He wrote to me saying that he had met me before. I cannot recall his features. What was or is his occupation?
 Ramanandababu’s note is indeed interesting; but that is his style whenever he is displeased with anything.libtech_487_footnote

 CHI. SUMANGAL PRAKASH,
I have you letter.
  One 	cannot give 	reasons for 	everything in 	this world. Dharma does 	not lie in giving 	up a 	custom simply because no 	reason can 	be given 	for it. On 	the contrary 	dharma consists in 	respecting the 	customs of 	the society 	of which 	one is 	part, provided these do 	not go 	against morality. 	Therein lies truth and 	non-violence. To 	cause pain to 	anyone without reason is 	untruth and 	violence. A 	person who 	gives up 	a practice 	because he cannot 	see any reason 	for its continuance 	is unwise and wilful.  In 	regard to 	inter-dining and 	inter-marriage there 	is not 	contradiction between my 	earlier writings and present writings. When I wrote 	those articles I had 	Lakshmi with me 	and I was planning to 	have her married outside the Dhed community.libtech_491_footnotelibtech_492_footnoteI still hold that in inter- dining 	and inter-marriage 	some restrictions 	are necessary. 	I do 	not think 	that varnashrama comes 	in here. 	There is no loss 	of dharma 	in marrying a 	suitable partner outside 	one’s varna. I may 	say that my views 	are now much 	clearer than before. But 	I hesitate 	to revise 	the views 	I have 	held for a 	long time. My 	present views 	supplement the 	views I 	have expressed 	earlier. However, 	if it appears 	that there 	is conflict 	between the two you 	should accept what 	I say 	now and reject what 	I have 	said before.  I 	should not 	answer this question. I 	am also not 	competent to 	answer it. 	Everyone should be 	able to 	find the meaning 	of the 	vow he has 	taken. The 	meaning that 	I may 	give to 	your vow 	should be 	considered false, 	while the meaning 	you give it 	should be 	taken as 	valid. When 	one does not have confidence 	in oneself 	one may accept 	a witness’s 	interpretation. Here the 	witness is not in 	a position  to 	givean interpretation. 	Therefore you should 	either interpret the 	vow yourself 	or ask 	other co-workers. That 	is because 	the address 	of the journal 	is changes.

I have left out the question about smallpox. Whether the patient
 is a child or an adult, I know only one treatment: apply a wet pack to the stomach. Dissolve some permanganate of potashlibtech_493_footnotelibtech_494_footnotein cold water, enough to make the water rose-pink. Dip a sheet, large or small, in the water and wring it. Then spread a rug on a cot and cover the rug with this wet sheet. Then wrap the whole round the patient right up to the neck. Keep him in this position for as long as he can bear it. If the patient does not get a motion in the natural course, give  him  an enema. For diet only fruit juice. If the tongue is clear and the patient feels hungry, milk also may be given. Give him a much water as he can drink. Add fews drops of lemon juice to the water if he likes that. The room should be well ventilated. I have heard that red curtains help.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I send with this a letter written by a lady named Malidoshi on behalf of the labourers working in the Ashram. You may not have read it. Inquire about the matter and let me know what the facts are.
 Madhavji’s brother Chatrabhuj writes to tell me that the former’s two children cannot be properly looked after in Calcutta. I have already suggested that the children’s aunt should take them to the Ashram and keep them there. She might leave after the children begin to feel at home there. You also should write to them and get the children under your charge if you can. I have written to Madhavji and Lakshmi about this.
I hope Duncan is better.
 Read my letter to Titus.libtech_495_footnoteYou may send the report of the dairy as it is. I will get a copy taken out here if necessary. Otherwise I will return it after reading it.
 
 To me also Keshu writes only a few lines every time. I have now given up hope about him. He has made up his mind to leave the Ashram. It seems Radha also wishes to live outside.
 I hope you received my letter in which I wrote  about  Dr.  Sharma and Parachure Shastri, and followed what I said. If you did not follow any point, please ask me to explain.

339,"April 	6, 1933",LETTER TO MIRABEHN,"
          CHI. 	MIRA,         April 	6, 1933 
  	Your letter came in only yesterday. I am beginning this before 	prayer 3.45. I overslept myself. Being the fasting day it does not 	much matter perhaps.  	You have done well in writing as you have done. The difficulty about 	the execution is threefold. (1) The Ashram site has to be removed or 	the other activities have to be. (2) There is no one in the Ashram 	who would stay on the condition you name, save perhaps Narandas. (3) 	The Ashram has not been conceived in the manner suggested by you.  	The last is perhaps the fatal difficulty. Mine is a novel 	experiment, dangerous and, it may be, even impossible of achieving. 	The idea is to have a place where people can train themselves to 	lead the celibate life in the midst of ordinary temptations. . . libtech_496_footnoteand . . . libtech_497_footnotefell not because they could not overcome animal 	passion. They have not gone so far. But they suppressed truth. Now 	truth can only be cultivated in the midst of men and women of 	different temperaments and subtle temptations. It is easy enough for 	a few people of similar habits not to deceive one another or be 	found out. That is no truth. It has to be lived in the natural 	surroundings. Exception has been taken even to the Ashram life as 	being not natural.  	I wonder if you have followed me so far. If you have, you must at 	once perceive that the first two difficulties are the natural 	consequence of the deliberate creation of the third. Having 	constituted the Ashram as it is we have the men and women and the 	activities that we have. And out of these men and women and the 	activities we cannot create what you have contemplated. What you 	suggest can only be done by withdrawing two or three men and women 	and sending them to another place to live their own life and draw 	some kindred spirits in due time. But that would be to admit 	failure.  I should not mind it if it became inevitable. I am not at 	all convinced that it is. If out of the present experiment a few of 	us lived of whom it could be said that they fairly satisfied the 	test, I should be quite satisfied that the experiment had succeeded. 	In an experiment such as we are making failures must be the order of 	the day. Each will be a     
 stepping-stone to success. The . . . incident has disturbed me but not baffled me at all. Prompt measures have been  taken after  the discovery and are still being taken.
 You should know also my diagnosis. The fault lay in my over-confidence in both these young people. The earlier fault lay in their parents.       had the notion that his children will better conform
 to the Ashram ideal if they were brought up in isolation.       nursed
 the thought. And so the children grew to be selfish, and exclusive and self-centred. The motive behind       was good. And so I carried  out
 the tradition after      ’s death. I was bound to as his heir to test its
 efficacy. The result we know. I am not sorry.       had every right to do
 what he thought was good for the Ashram. As for . . . the way with . . .
 was reverse. But       did not quite assist her husband. She had no
 policy of her own but she herself could not follow out the Ashram ideal and so       grew anyhow as the pet of the Ashram. The natural
 thing is likely to happen now. The proud family of . . . will cut themselves from the Ashram and live their natural life. That will not be bad. .  .  .  has learnt her lesson. She will for      ’s sake more  and
 more conform to the ideal. . . . was the dupe,       was the villain (used
 not in its quite ugly sense). The whole Ashram knows that truth at any cost will alone save it. Things will tighten themselves along these lines.
 Several other things will be gradually done. No violent changes will be made. There is not the slightest cause for alarm. You are perhaps unnecessarily harsh on Prema. She has her grave blemishes but she has contributed nothing to the incident. Her physical brahmacharya appears to me to be above suspicion and she is truthful to the point of bluntness. She is meticulous in the observance of the outward rules. She has a vile tongue. She is trying to control it. Anyway there is no one who can conduct the Ashram better than Narandas. He must be left to manage it to the best of his ability.
 Now I want you to work at this exhaustive letter and give me your criticism, ideas and suggestions unhesitatingly and without reserve. You have plenty of time for hard thinking. I am unperturbed, I am taking things easy, meeting each situation as it arises. Narandas will faithfully carry out instructions. And if I felt the call I am quite capable of disbanding the whole Ashram in so far as I have the power which legally I have not. But that is nothing. The moral authority is there. You may therefore make any drastic suggestions you like.
 All well here otherwise. You will explain to Ba whatever is said here in so far as it may be necessary.
Love from us all.

 April 6, 1933
 
 MY DEAR N.,
I have your letters of 31st March and 2nd April together.
 You were quite right in accepting Sreenivas Rao’s gifts and asking him to send you whole wheatmeal and dried fruit. It is a great handicap that you can get no fresh leafy vegetables. But you know that leafy vegetables are grown in no time. I had an English friend living with me in South Africa who grew sufficient cresses in a fortnight’s time. You should get some seeds, have just a little plot of land, fence it in, dig it well superficially and beat up the earth well. You can use the manure that the animals around you may give, and sow lettuce seeds, tomatoes and any of the leaves that grow easily there. You should make some explorations also in and about Chital- drug. I cannot imagine all that place being without leafy vegetables known as bhaji. I would ask you not to abstain from milk and butter at least just now. You may take only a little quantity if you like, but I am afraid that you will become weak in due course if you do not take these two things, for you are not having enough fresh fruit nor wheatmeal.
 You need not write anything to Durgadaslibtech_501_footnotelibtech_502_footnoteabout your statement, but write it out yourself from memory and let me have it.libtech_503_footnote
 I understand what you say about pulses for S. As he is very active according to the description you gave me here, perhaps there is no harm if he is given a moderate quantity.
 I shall send you the book on village sanitation. I am writing to the Ashram, but let me give you the substance of Poore’s method. The theory is that 18 inches of the surface of earth is all filled with germs which do the work of scavenging for all the creatures that reside on it. These germs can work on all the filth that the creatures deposit on the surface of the earth from day to day. Poore having known this and having understood the most economical use that the Chinese make of human excreta developed his method and said that
 
 all the excreta, both liquid and solid, should be buried not more than 12 or at the outside 18 inches below the surface of the earth. He therefore does not suggest movable latrines nor the ordinary deeppit latrines. He suggests receiving the excreta in buckets, each person covering the excreta with earth, which is ready in the closet, so that the closet remains clean and sweet-smelling all the time. These buckets are emptied in the squares, dug up and kept ready, not many yards away from the latrine itself, and then the earth, which is heaped up on the edge of the square, is taken up and the excreta covered with it. No more excreta should be heaped upon the deposit just made. Ample earth is thrown on each deposit so that dogs and other animals may not dig out the thing. Inside of a fortnight all that excreta is worked upon by the germs and turned into fine manure and the ground is ready for cultivation.
 We have followed this plan most successfully at the Ashram for 17 years, that is, since its inception. The whole of the performance takes no time and there is no smell emitted out of these squares.
 I hope you will have no difficulty in following what I have said. This is the cheapest method of dealing with human and other excreta. All the kitchen refuse is also dealt with in the same manner, only this cannot be mixed up with the excreta, because the work of the germs done upon vegetable rubbish is different from the work done upon the excreta. But the process is the same in all other respects. We have found in the Ashram, by observation, that wherever we have made use of this excellent manure, our crops have been much richer in quantity and quality.
If you have any difficulty in following this, please ask.
 Of course you are quite right in asking the Municipality to give you all the assistance you need. If they give it, well and good; if they do not, you won’t worry or fidget. For the time being, you have your work cut out for you amongst the Harijans, and what is more, in mending yourself.
 Now about the dress. You need three articles only—a loose vest somewhat after men’s shirt with short sleeves reaching up to the elbow only, skirt reaching 2 or 3 inches above the ankles, and a kuchh like mine but not so long and smaller in size. If you want to go to the trouble of sewing, you can have something after the style of men’s shorts. This makes the simplest dress. The bawis, that is, the female mendicants, wear something like this. Your saris can be turned into
 vests or shirts. The skirts you have should serve the purpose, and very probably you have something answering knickers or shorts.
 Yours sincerely,
[PS.]
As to your addressing me Bapu, you are wrong. You will address
 me as such when you have confidence in yourself that you will inspire me with trust in you and will never deceive me. I am trying to trust you by signing myself Bapu.

 Your objection regarding the name of the Central Board is quite sound, but the name was adopted before the name ‘Harijan’ came into vogue. But all the Boards are known as Harijan Seva Samaj or Mandal in the Indian languages.

You have given me the information I was anxious to have. Kusumbehn is perhaps the most obedient patient you have had, at least in the Ashram, and since you have full confidence in your treatment having done her good, it shall continue without interruption, so long as she retains faith in you and in your treatment. She is disturbed, as I am also, over the frequent attacks of diarrhoea she is having. I suppose I am properly describing the frequent motions she has every few days, but if that also is a part of the treatment, then neither she nor I can have anything to say. Of course I have in mind your idea of a proper sanatorium, but that lies in the womb of the future.

If bajri and jawar don’t suit you, you must stop 	them. I should like to put you on unboiled milk. You may at the same 	time eat a few raisins, chewing them slowly and sucking the juice. 	That will make you feel that you have eaten something. Tomatoes 	should grow in the Ashram all the year round. And when bhaji is 	in season, you may eat    
 that and other greens, boiled. If you can live on these things, I don’t think anything more will be necessary. You will be able to keep up your strength on this diet. Try it.

Then you have to go over to milk 	and curds. If you give up chillies and other spices, you will be 	saved from many troubles. Having shown this much self-control make 	it complete.

 DEAR DR. DESHMUKH,
I badly need your assistance in one or two things.
  Is 	there any 	chemical or 	physiological 	distinction between 	carrion and 	slaughtered meat? If 	there is, 	what is it?  Do 	you know 	of any 	medical reason 	for the 	great repugnance 	that even meat-eaters have against carrion?  If 	you are of 	opinion that there is 	no difference between 	fresh carrion 	and slaughtered 	meat, can 	you say whether flesh 	of dead 	cattle treated two or 	three days after death 	or even 	24 hours 	after death would make any difference?  You 	may know 	that some Chamars 	poison cattle 	for possessing 	the carcasses 	and they 	are said 	to eat their 	flesh. Will not the flesh of poisoned cattle affect the eater in any 
 
 way? Is the flesh not tainted by the poison, or are there any poisons which, while they kill the cattle, do not harm their flesh?libtech_510_footnote
 You know all about the Bombay Corporation and, therefore, you know all about the slaughter-houses. What I would like you, therefore, to give me is the scientific method of skinning dead cattle and of separating all the different parts of the carcass and the way  of  disposing of all the parts in the most economical manner. You should be knowing how, apart from the meat, the skins, bones, entrails, etc., of the slaughtered cattle are disposed of.
 If those in charge of slaughter-houses cannot give all the information, I would like you to go out of your way to secure the most exhaustive information for me.
 I do hope you are getting the English Harijan. In that case you must have read my article about “Disposal of Carcasses”libtech_511_footnote.  If  you have not read it, I would like you please to do so.
 Yours sincerely,

 "
356,,THE LAW AND THE HEART,"
    
 A sanatanist who believes in temple-entry by Harijans but who does not think that legislation to this effect will serve any purpose, in one of his letters writes.libtech_512_footnote
 The extract quoted above is couched in beautiful language but the writer has not attempted to understand facts relating to legislation. There is no doubt that untouchability is a mental attitude. It cannot be abolished by legislation. Law can touch the body, but not the mind. The mind can be touched only by love and persuasion.
 For the spreading of dharma any other means cannot be effective, nor should they be resorted to.
 
 
    dix.      
  desirability 	of legislation enabling Harijans to enter temples, on the ground 	that this might lead to friction. He had advocated educating public 	opinion for the purpose. 
 The correspondent is afraid of strife. This fear too in my opinion is unfounded. No one wants to have the temples opened by force. Temples will be opened only where public opinion has been prepared in favour of opening the temples to the Harijans and nowhere else.
 If that is so, then why the legislation? As conditions are today, even if the Hindu temple-goers, priests and custodians of a temple desire that Harijans should be allowed inside the temple for darshan, the law prevents them from doing so. There is no doubt about this; it is a self-evident fact. Legislation is needed to have this obstructive legislation revoked. It is clear enough that only legislation can remove legislative restriction. Yes, in the new legislation that is being talked about there should be no compulsion. One compulsive legislation should not be replaced by another compulsive legislation. As far as I understand, no question of compulsion arises in either of the two bills. The idea in both is to remove legal interference only.
 But, today, the orthodox are so adamant that they are not prepared to listen to anyone. They write lies, they slander, abuse, and even resort to violence. Under such conditions what are the reformers to do? If the reformers wish to safeguard dharma, their first duty is patiently to put up with the high-handedness of the orthodox, answer hatred with love, and lies with truth. Let them bear abuses and violence. Let them continue to do their duty. Let them continue their efforts to have the obstructive law repealed. Let them make attempts to have private temples opened to Harijans, and themselves keep away from temples which are barred to Harijans. The reformers should also endeavour to remove any other difficulties that the Harijans may be facing.
 I have spoken and written several times that for me abolition of untouchability is a penance. Religious impurity cannot be removed without self-purification. Untouchability is the greatest impurity in Hindu religion. Even if thousands of Hindus were to fast in order to remove it I should not consider it a great thing. Perhaps, even such a great offering may not be sufficient for that great yajna. In order to find Lord Shiva what a great deal of fasting Parvati had to do! Every time man was faced with a spiritual crisis he invoked God through fasting and penance and only then was he able to overcome the crisis. Tulsidas has written:
By the strength of tapasya God created the universe,
 
 
 
 earth.
 By the strength of tapasya Vishnu protects all creation, By the strength of tapasya Shambhu destroys,
By the strength of  tapasya Shesha carries  the   burden  of   the
 
All creation rests on the strength of   tapasya. Understand this,
 "
357,,THREE CONUNDRUMS,"
  	and go forth to do tapasya. [From Hindi]  Harijan 	Sevak, 7-4-1933        A 	teacher asks:   According 		to the 		system of varnashrama, 		in which varna would the 		Bhangis and Chamars be placed? May one following one trade marry among those following another trade?  Since 		untouchability must be eradicated why should we not also inter-dine 		with the untouchables?  Strictly 	speaking all these questions have been answered in  Harijan Sevak in one way or another. I shall nevertheless 	answer them here in the hope further to elucidate the matter.  	In my view the system of varnashrama does not today exist any more. 	All the varnas have given up their respective functions. The 	Shastras say, and reason agrees, that when all the attributes of the 	varnas vanish the varnas themselves vanish. The varnas have today 	given up their dharma and so there has come about a confusion of 	varnas. If there is any varna that still survives it is the Shudra 	varna. It is under this varna that all of us, “touchables” and 	untouchables, ought to be classed. If this is not desired, people 	may choose for themselves what varna they like. The point is that 	varnashrama as an institution does not exist any more. Dharma is not 	a matter of  choosing; it is not a matter of rights, only of duty. 	In dharma there is no one high and no one low.  	The second question concerns intermarriage. I have repeatedly said 	that marriage is not a matter necessarily connected with the varna 	divisions. It is a personal matter. As a rule, however, people like 	to enter into matrimonial alliances with their neighbours or with 	people who are like them. The practice therefore of people marrying 	among people belonging to the same occupations as themselves will 	continue. 
 The third question is one concerning inter-dining. Removal of untouchability as it has today been defined does not include within its scope inter-dining, and rightly so. Eating and drinking are personal matters. One will eat and drink where it pleases one to. Certain norms will nevertheless remain. Everyone will not be eating everywhere indiscriminately. While no hard and fast rules can be laid down it must however be said that no considerations of high and low should apply here. Unfortunately in Hinduism today the only things that remain are these considerations of high and low, touchability and untouchability. Everyone treats others as lower than themselves and refuse to touch food or water offered by them. I see nothing of dharma in this. On the contrary in this way we only make ourselves the laughing-stock of the world.

 "
358,"April 	7, 1933",LETTER TO C. F. ANDREWS,"
         MY 	DEAR CHARLIE,    April 	7, 1933 
  	I have your letters and enclosures, also copy of an article of yours 	in an old number of The Modern Review.libtech_513_footnote  	I understand and even appreciate the moral repulsion against 	‘fasting unto death’. I have perhaps some repulsion, if not the 	same repulsion, against fasting unto death myself, but I remain 	unmoved. There are many other things I have done and am still doing 	against my will, because I count my will as nothing before God’s 	will when I see it clearly before me. I will make myself as certain 	as it is humanly possible to be that the will that appears to me to 	be God’s is really His, and not the Devil’s. But when I am clear 	about it, I rejoice in obeying that will, rather than mine, although 	I may have no human companion to endorse it. That this kind of 	fasting has a definite  place  in Hinduism, and properly so, I have 	not a shadow of a doubt, but it is a privilege that comes only to a 	few, and when it comes in obedience to  a call from above, it has a 	mighty force, only fasting unto death is a corrupt expression. Where 	I used it first, it had its definite meaning.    
 Now it is being used torn from its context and looks certainly barbarous. But it is there, and its real meaning is unmistakable, and you can almost say that it is not so much a ‘fasting unto death’ as it is  a ‘fasting unto a new life’.
 All the same, I value your letter and the information you give me about the English attitude. I do want English sympathy in this big struggle. I do want also to be understood. You cannot therefore be too frank or too communicative with me.libtech_514_footnoteI   shall  never  misunderstand whatever these few English friends might have to say.
 Kirby Page’s article which you have sent I shall see as soon as I get time, and if there is anything worth saying, I shall reduce it to writing.
 I hope that your brother’s septic teeth were extracted and that he had benefited by the extraction.
 You know all about Verrier’s change of mind. He had changed it before your blessings were received, and you know the reason also for the change. Whilst I was prepared to bless the marriage, I cannot help saying that I blessed the change still more. So much depended upon Verrier’s decision. I told him that if it was a human want on his part, he must marry, no matter what misinterpretation might be put upon his action. The change came over both Verrier and Mary without any prompting from anybody at all.libtech_515_footnote

359,"April 	7, 1933",LETTER TO G. D. BIRLA,"
         MY 	DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS, I 	have your letter of 28th March.    April 	7, 1933 
  	I do not mind those who have, under a mistaken notion, gone away 	from the Hindu fold, returning when they like.  But  what  I cannot 	understand is the occasion for any expense whatsoever in connection 	with their return. For, if they have left the Hindu fold under a 	mistaken notion, as soon as they discover their mistake, it is 	itself a sufficient prayashchitta, and no further ceremony is 	necessary. So much on the merits. Assuming that there must be some 	expense which the returning  Domslibtech_516_footnotecannot be expected to pay, why should not the S.U.S.libtech_517_footnotelibtech_518_footnotebear 	the expense or contribute its quota? I should give my answer in the 	negative, because I feel that the S.U.S. has its very defined 	sphere, namely, service of the Hindu Harijans. It has no connection 	with those who are today not Hindus. Its sphere begins after the 	return of the prodigals. The latter is the function  of  a  separate 	organization altogether. Here therefore there is no question of 	fear, but it is a question of confining ourselves to the original 	purpose. However limited it may be, the return of the Doms is a kind 	of shuddhi, and the difference between the extreme shuddhi 	and this modified shuddhi is a difference in degree only. 	 And  once  the Society takes up this modified form, it would be 	most difficult for it [not] to lend its assistance to the various 	other shades. However desirable therefore the return of the Doms to 	Hinduism may be, I am quite clear that its encouragement by the 	Society is outside the scope laid down at its very foundation.  	As to the advertisement of the Titagarh Mills, I am quite clear that 	we may not entertain their advertisement in any shape or form, and 	if it is a matter of getting cheap paper, it can be had from many 	other mills without the slightest difficulty. We are getting the 	paper for the English edition at less than market-price. It was 	possible to have a still more reduced quotation, but I thought it 	would not be proper to ask for further accommodation.     
 As to the Hindi Harijan, I have already told you that it is getting on quite satisfactorily, and if you persist in the effort, I have no doubt that you will make it self-supporting in about a month’s time. You will see the note about it in the ensuing number of the English Harijan.libtech_519_footnote

DEAR DR. DESHMUKH,
 I am very grateful to you for your most exhaustive and learned reply to my query. I liked it so much that although the editing of the ensuing number of the Harijan was finished, I made room for your letter. Of course you may hand the correspondence for publication in the local Press.
 There is a domestic matter on which I want your advice. As you know, Sardar Vallabhbhai has some trouble about his nose. It has worried him all these many months, but just now the irritation has gone almost beyond endurance, as it seems to us onlookers. As you know it is not his habit to complain, but we, his companions, know what it all means to him. The prison medical men have undoubtedly done whatever they were capable of doing. But their remedies have brought no relief. I notice that he has, constantly to clean his nose, and there is always some discharge coming out. He uses a big towel for the purpose and in 24 hours it is fairly dirty all over. By a big towel I mean a bathing towel that is used in middle class Hindu households. It has appeared to me that if he cleaned his nose with warm water 3 or 4 times a day he will not have so much discharge and will not have the trouble he has in cleaning the nose. But he has been told by a doctor here that washing the nose is likely to dry it. All the affected part is therefore likely to cause greater discomfort. Though I did not have the same class of disease as Sardar Vallabhbhai has, the only way I have kept myself clean and free from any trouble has been
 
 to wash out the nose constantly, sometimes taking in the water and bringing it out through the mouth. At one time I used to have a nasal douche with a little permanganate solution added to the water and sometimes a few grains of chinosol. I do not know whether in your opinion washing of the nose with simple warm water or with anything added to it is likely to give relief to the Sardar. If you have any other suggestion to make you will please make it. I would ask you not to publish this information. I have simply written to you for my own satisfaction.
 There are one or two more questions of a public character and regarding public health which I would like to ask presently if I am not unduly encroaching upon your time.

 I liked your letter very much. You may gladly study whatever you want. However, the solution to the problem you see is contained in the idea on which the Ashram is founded. It may not appear so today but you should have no doubt in your mind that is the only solution. There is no other. This is the key to  understanding  a religion. First it should be grasped in all its details. Then we should consider the views of its opponents. Then if we find that it does not triumph in all experience we must not despair. Here, it is faith that works. There will be apparent oppositions and failures. But we should not be frightened by them.
 If Pannalal has not received my letter, give it to him after taking permission if possible. It is at the Ashram.

 “HARIJAN SEVAK”
 The readers know that there is a Hindi edition of the Harijan called the Harijan Sevak, which is published in  Delhi  by  the Hindustan Times Press.
 It has not yet become self-supporting, whereas the English has. If any of the editions has to show a loss, I should personally prefer that it were English, for real propaganda against untouchability has to be carried on amongst the masses and, therefore, the message has to be delivered to them. Hence the necessity for publishing correct infor-
 mation in the various Indian languages, and as Hindi is admittedly the most largely understood and spoken language, one would like to see a large circulation of the Hindi Sevak. It is steadily improving and, being more or less the same in substance as the English edition, it naturally contains most of the things to be found in the English edition, besides things of special interest to the Hindi reader. At the present moment about 1,000 copies are sold. At least 2,500 copies should be sold in order to make it self-supporting. I hope that the various organizations in the Hindi-speaking areas will see to an increased circulation of the Hindi edition. The workers should report their need of the kind of literature wanted in their districts.
 TWO CORRECTIONS
 The newly published Sanatani has a well-deserved laugh at the expense of Harijan by telling its readers that the opening of two temples in Ratnagiri reported in the issue of 25th February  was repeated in that of 4th March. This was an obvious mistake for discovering which I offer the Sanatani my congratulations. Its inference, however, that, if temples continue to open as in Ratnagiri, there should be no need for Temple-entry Bills is hardly justified, inasmuch as these were private temples. And even if the trustees of a stray public temple were to run the risk of a prosecution and open the temple under their charge, the trustees of other public temples cannot be expected to do so.
 The other correction to be made is on behalf of Shrimati Rama Devi of Cuttack, who says that in the general description of her activitylibtech_522_footnoteshe did not mean that she herself did the actual teaching but that the girls who accompanied her did it.
 BHOR STATE AND UNTOUCHABILITY
 One read in the papers that the Chief of Bhor had abolished untouchability in his State, so far as the law was concerned.
 I have now got the text of the proclamation dated 1st November 1932. It is as comprehensive as it can be and advises the subjects of the State for the sake of their own religious advancement to do away with untouchability as it is observed today.
 Those who have supplied me with a copy of the proclamation have also given me a bulky report of the reformers’ activity in the
 
 Sudhagad Taluka of the Bhor State and they mention their hopes and their difficulties about their work. The workers are few, and the tremendous activity that has covered the whole of India in connection with untouchability woke up the orthodox party also in Bhor State, and so the reformers experienced unexpected opposition, so much so that the Harijans were themselves frightened to take advantage of the services that the few reformers were prepared and able to offer.
 I need not take up the space of Harijan and the time of the reader by recounting the difficulties and describing the successes that the reformers had. The reading of their report has left the impression on my mind that reformers need not expect thorough success, unless they are themselves willing to suffer boycott, complete ostracism, and, maybe, even loss of their social position and their belongings. Easy chair and substantial religious reform go ill together. The orthodox party, sincerely believing that their religion is in peril, may  be  expected to fight every inch of the ground and to give no quarter to the reformers. They have been taught to believe that to relegate a large portion of mankind to perpetual untouchability and all it means is a just retribution. They will not hesitate to believe that those who seek to free untouchables from their shackles would deserve the same retribution and, from their own point of view, they may  not be blamed. The reformer, therefore, who has a religious conviction about the necessity of reform is expected to brave all the consequences of his activity, and if a sufficient number is found all over India, the result is a certainty in spite of the opposition of orthodoxy. For I believe that truth and time are on the side of reformers, and where these are ensured, it matters little whether reformers are few or many.
 As Thoreau has said so well, “All reform all the world over always began with one person taking it up.”
 Harijan, 8-4-1933
 "
366,,HARIJANS AND TEMPLE-ENTRY,"
    
The other day a deputation of Harijans led by Rao Bahadur M.
  Rajah 	waited on H. 	E. the Viceroy with reference 	to the Temple-entry 	Bills. The 	following extract from 	their representation 	will be read with interest: 
 The opening of temples to our people along with other Hindu castes is  a matter of the greatest importance for our social emancipation. We quite
 realize that we cannot hope for a permanent emancipation and betterment unless our status in the Hindu religion is improved. We, therefore, hope Your Excellency’s Government will assist the passage into Law of the Temple-entry and Anti-untouchability Bills. . . .
 The courts in India are now assisting the enforcement of the supers- tition of untouchability. British Law has not left the superstition to its own resources, but has placed the machinery of the courts and the State at the disposal of the caste Hindus in the maintenance of those superstitious prac- tices. Even if the Government cannot interfere in the religious practices of the Hindus, it should at least refrain from assisting in the enforcement of such practices, when they are opposed to humanity and public welfare as in the case of the treatment accorded to us. The Bill for the abolition of untouchability, sought to be introduced in the Assembly, puts an end to this anomaly and does not interfere with the religion of any person or community.
 The Temple-entry Bill, for which we seek Your Excellency’s support, is drafted so as to provide a legal machinery for peaceful and gradual evolution of reform with the consent of the people concerned. Each locality will be enabled to work out a suitable compromise for solving the question of our status. We beg Your Excellency to help in the achievement of a peaceful solution of this question that so fundamentally affects the dignity and the daily life of a community of forty-six million souls who cling to the ancient Hindu religion, to which they belong, and who wish to find an honourable place in it without causing turmoil or disturbance.
 In the face of the above, it is a cruel suggestion to make that the Harijans do not want temple-entry. There is undoubtedly a difference of opinion as to the emphasis laid on temple-entry as compared to the economic and political uplift. But not even Dr. Ambedkar opposes temple-entry. He will be the first man to bring it up against the caste Hindus, and rightly, if there was no movement for temple-entry. The fact is temple-entry is not a substitute for any other uplift. It is an indispensable test that religious untouchability has been abolished and that the Harijan is no longer the pariah of Hindu society. It is not impossible to conceive that untouchables may all become econo- mically and politically superior to the caste Hindus and may yet be treated as untouchable by caste Hindus, no matter how poor and even degraded they themselves may be. There are many individual Harijans who are economically well off and are members of legislative and municipal bodies, but to the orthodox caste Hindu, they are just as untouchable as they ever were, so long as they have no right of
 temple-entry, as the caste Hindus have. Temple-entry prohibition and the consequent segregation that it carries with it constitute the distinguishing bar sinister of perpetual degradation. When  that  is lifted, and only then, will religious untouchability be said to have been abolished. The question, therefore, is not how many Harijans want temple-entry or, having got the privilege, will exercise it.
 Caste Hindus have to recognize that right if they will purify Hinduism and render justice to over forty millions of fellow Hindus. The reformers may not, therefore, slacken their effort. The fact that the Bills have been hung up is no cause for despondency or going to sleep. The passage of the Bills, since they are private, will mean a mere register of the Hindu will, if they are passed by a clear Hindu majority and if they have the backing of Hindu opinion outside. They would be of no importance to me if they were forced upon Hindus by  a superior power. I am interested in them because they are necessary to remove a legal hindrance in the way of reform. Whether orthodoxy represents the majority or the minority of one, it is able to stop the onward march of reform. The Bills are required for the sake of religious toleration. They have no further or other use.
 That points to the necessity for legislation and the education of public opinion in the matter of Temple-entry Bills, if the  public temples are ever to be opened. The pace will be accelerated if private temples, of which there are many, are opened and if temples  for general worship are built where public opinion demands it. As a result of the recent brief tour of Shrimati Vijayalakshmi Pandit in Kathiawar, she told me that there was a movement in Rajkot for the building of a general temple for the use of all Hindus—Harijans, reformers and the orthodox, if the last will join.libtech_523_footnotelibtech_524_footnoteThe temple is proposed to be built after the ancient pattern, so as to combine a school dharmashala, a place of congregation and worship. I do hope that those who have the scheme in hand will persevere with it and bring it to fruition. There need not be much money required for it. It can be built in sections as the huge temples of the South could only have been. A beginning can be made at once by securing a good open site and the services of a devout honest pujari. Mere brick and mortar is of no use, if the pujari in charge is corrupt.
But I am digressing; my purpose for the moment is to drive
 
 home the truth that the temple-entry movement must be carried on by
   educating 		public opinion as to 		the necessity 		of legal 		provision for 		removing the legal difficulty, inducing 		private owners to open 		their temples to 		the Harijans  
and
  building 		new temples where 		necessary and 		where public  
 benefaction would provide funds to build combination temples after the ancient manner on sites easily accessible to Harijans.

 A controversy has been going on whether the saints, especially of Maharashtra, have favoured untouchability. Sjt. P. H. Gadre  of Nasik has contended that they have not only not favoured it but written unequivocally against it and have laid it down in emphatic terms that a man is to be judged and known, not according to his birth, but according to his deeds and that devotion to God purifies all men irrespective of their caste.
I reproduce below a selectionlibtech_525_footnotelibtech_526_footnotefrom the verses collected by Sjt.
Gadre from the celebrated saint Tukaram.
 The translation is taken, unless otherwise stated, from the work of Messrs Fraser and Marathe, who have kindly permitted Sjt. Gadre to quote from their work.
 I hope that Sjt. Gadre or some other student will send a similar collection from the writings of the other saints. The reader will remember the quotation reproduced in these columns from Moropant, who describes untouchables as Harijans.

368,,WHAT IT MEANS,"
      
 I gave the other day an extractlibtech_527_footnotelibtech_528_footnotefrom the experiences of a new teacher of Harijans. Here is a free and condensed  translation  of extracts from a recent letter of his:
 Within the few days that I have been teaching these child- ren, I see that I have to give them object-lessons in every- thing. Cleanliness is the most difficult thing. For the past fortnight, therefore, I take the children regularly for bathing. I get them to wash their clothes with a bit of soap. Of the little children I wash the clothes myself. I supply them with brush sticks and get them to use them every day. I pare their nails and attend to every other detail. The result is that cleanliness occupies a larger place in my mind just now than giving them a knowledge of the three R’s. Their parents appreciate this personal attention that is being given to their children. Now they, too, come to my nightly gatherings. I give them stories from the Ramayana, Jatakmala and adaptations from Tolstoy, and I propose to add Nanabhai’s sketches of the heroes of the Mahabharata.
 In the morning I have an attendance of about ten children. There is a double attendance in the evening. Generally I take pleasure in this work, but events happen that confound me. Sometimes drunkards appear on the scene. Sometimes there is a proper fight between husband and wife, and sometimes I have to be an unwilling listener to choice abuse. Boys try my temper at times. Once one of them went beyond limits in his pranks and I had to take him by the hand and put him out. But I have faith in God and I am hoping that this will be my life-work. I know that it is most taxing and if I did not hold on to my faith in God, I should have a recurring fit of disappointments.
 You have drawn my attention to weaning them from the habit of taking leavings of food from their employers. But I shall be patient. When I have gained their confidence, I shall broach the subject to them.
 I would love to learn how to skin carcasses and tan the hides. This is necessary if I am to deal with the habit of
 
 carrion-eating. Many of them add to it the drink habit and it is the commonest thing for both men and women to indulge in tobacco. The more I come in touch with them, the more I am baffled by the insanitation amongst many of them. There is a stench coming from their bodies and their clothes, especially when they have eaten carrion. Add to this the foul smell coming from the dung heaps. In order to minimize the effect of these smells, I generally sit under the open sky.
 This is followed by a heart-rending description of the dirty  habits of two boys. Such experiences need not dishearten any teacher. Let us remember that this is a direct result of the criminal neglect of caste men and of compulsory segregation of the most useful members of society, and all that in the name of religion. If we are to reduce our death-rate and to bring under control the diseases that are rampant among us, we will have to have hundreds like this teacher, who would work amongst Harijans with real love and unquenchable faith. We have to feel towards these children as if they were our very own. What do parents do when they have their children suffering from terrible confluent smallpox or still more dreadful diseases, filling their rooms with stench and dirt? They do not mind staking their everything in order to see their children cured. We shall have to bestow the same love on these Harijan children. We shall have to have  the  same patience with them even as we have for our own. Whatever may be said to the contrary, I shall proclaim from the housetops that, unless we remove the scourge of untouchability from our hearts, Hinduism is doomed. The Shastras do not warrant the neglect of a single human being in the way in which we have neglected over 40 millions, and if we would repent of our sins, I would like to have an army of voluntary workers, drawn from the so-called higher classes, offering to teach and take care of Harijan children.

 I 	have your letter.  	So far as I am concerned, I have no hesitation in saying ‘welcome’.libtech_530_footnotelibtech_531_footnoteThe 	hesitation may well be all on your part. I would love to have all 	nationalities and religions represented in the Ashram, but if it has 	not up to now succeeded in attracting them all, it is due to our 	limitations. We have many shortcomings to overcome.  	You talk of your ‘old age’. If you can disclose it without blus- 	hing, let me have it; but I am quite sure that you are not 64, and I 	should be sorry to think that I am regarded as an  encumbrance 	because of my old age. Totaramji, whom you must know by this time by 	his name, is older I think even than I am. Therefore you need not 	worry about your age. What view Narandas and the other members of 	the Ashram take, I shall presently ascertain. I shall ask him to 	give their opinion quite frankly as they should do without needing 	any warning from me. But even if you decide to throw in your lot 	with the Ashram and the Ashram gladly takes you, as a preliminary, 	let it be definitely for one year, for your convenience. I attach 	very great importance to the spiritual value of a promise, a pledge 	or a vow, by whichever name we may describe the act. Therefore if 	you take the final plunge at once it means that it will leave no 	door open for escape. One who has great regard for the sanctity of 	vows will therefore be cautious. After you have tried yourself in 	the Ashram for one year and found that you like the physical as well 	as the spiritual     
 surroundings, then you may take the final plunge.
I hope you are both enjoying yourselves in beautiful Kashmir.
Do write regularly from there.
Love from us all to you both.

Moreover, the Harijan can only publish the barest summary of 	your activities, whereas the local Press would be expected to give 	ample space to each one of the items you may supply it with.

  	I thank you for your letter.libtech_533_footnoteIs it not a universal experience that things that 	were at one time pure have become impure through the march of time? 	Both the Mahabharata and the Ramayana containample 	evidence that at one time varnadharma was followed in the sense I 	have described.  	I never knew that it was the impression of almost all the Hindus 	that the caste system was the same as the varnashrama. No Hindu to 	my knowledge has claimed that there are innumerable varnas, but 	every child knows that there are numberless castes. Is it not also a 	fact that there are many castes claimed to belong to the same varna? 	So far    
 as I can see, the origin of caste is wholly different from the origin of varna, and except up to a certain point the function also of caste differs from that of varna.
 I do claim that in ideal varna there can be no inequality what- soever. There would be a variety, but not inequality.

Your letters though long give me more and more insight into your 	mind and I like that in connection with all co-workers. You have not 	perceived that you have put the cart before the horse in the 	proposals you have made. In none of your proposals is there any 	effort required on our part. Everything has got to be done through 	the Legislatures, therefore through the Government, and that, 	throughout history, has been the way to perdition. All the reform 	that you adumbrate can only come after we have made adequate effort 	at least to arouse public conscience against the monster of 	untouchability. Untouchability is the extremist form that the 	oppression by the high-caste Hindus over so-called lower castes has 	taken. I would like you therefore to study the genesis of 	untouchability and its far-reaching effects far more fully than you 	seem to have done.  	I hope you have almost regained your lost strength.

  	You ought to go and see Seth Poonamchand Ranka as early as possible. 	Tell him that his fast is against the principle of satyagraha and on 	my part I feel that it cannot be defended on any grounds. Everyone 	is not against the classification of prisoners. Not all of the 	prisoners who get “A” and “B” classes willingly accept “C” 	class. One who is given a higher class is not bound to enjoy all the 	conven- iences of that class. Those who avail themselves of those 	facilities are doing that of their own accord. How can Seth 	Poonamchand compel them to forsake those facilities? How can he 	resort to fast for that? That he may give up a number of facilities 	himself is a different thing altogether. I myself do not like 	classifications but fasting is not the means by which the changes 	can be effected. I hope that Shri Poonamchand Ranka will give up his 	stubbornness. He should know that as long as he considers himself a 	satyagrahi, he is obliged to observe discipline. As an originator of 	satyagraha I should have some right to lay down the code for a 	satyagrahi. From that point of view also he should listen to my 	advice.  	May God grant you success.

 do that, since the word used in the service is “wine”. It is more likely, however, that they might use grape juice which has no intoxicating effect. Some scholars do interpret “wine” in the original as “unfer- mented grape juice”. So in any case there must be grape juice. Such blameless juice is used in some churches, and nowadays hundreds of thousands of bottles of such grape juice are available. In Trivedi’s books also which you have sent, different methods of obtaining such grape juice are described. Hence the suggestions to use it can be immediately implemented.

 CHI. GANGABEHN,
I have your letter.
Read the accompanying letter to Shardalibtech_537_footnotelibtech_538_footnoteand give it to her.
 You may not be able to provide Krishnamaiyadevi a job, but you can certainly give her some work to do. You can give her sewing and embroidery work, as you formerly used to do. My point is that she must produce something and not feel that she is living on charity.
 Dharmakumar’s education should consist in his upbringing at home. That is the ideal of education in the Ashram. If children learn from their parents to be virtuous and to love bodily labour, book-learning they will get afterwards. We know from experience that book-learning does not always make a person virtuous. I am sure that anybody who possesses a good character will never starve, though he may not become rich. Misplaced compassion is not non-violence; it is, on the contrary, a form of subtle violence and one should, therefore,
 
 guard against it all the more carefully. You should help both Krishnamaiya and Mahavir, but in the right manner. They should shake off their lethargy and work, and live contentedly. Pyare Ali says that he can help Mahavir to earn up to Rs. 40 or 50. If he does not get more than Rs. 25 at Sundardas’s place and if he satisfies Sundardas by his work, it would be better, provided of course the latter can release him, to keep him with Pyare Ali. Think over this.       ’slibtech_539_footnotelibtech_540_footnotewhole

 certain pleasures and, therefore, she also was not fit to live in the Ashram. If they leave,      libtech_544_footnotelibtech_545_footnotecertainly cannot live alone in the Ashram.
 Thus the whole family will leave. This is no ordinary event. But it is right that they should leave. We would not like anybody to  stay  against his wishes. This is our reward for having practically exempted the family from observing the Ashram rules.      libtech_546_footnotenow wishes to take
 up an independent job in some factory. It seems he wants to join       libtech_547_footnote.
 There will be no harm if he can do so. Of course his expenses will be high. In Deolali itself  the   family  will  spend  about  Rs.  100.         libtech_548_footnote
 himself will spend rather freely. I, therefore, think that their expenses will come to Rs. 150. God’s will be done. The Ashram, of course, will stop giving them money. But I think we shall have to give them a month’s expenses.
 You seem to be fairly occupied in solving family problems  there. Do try and solve them.
 If Kaku and Lakshmi have developed such relations that they even meet each other alone, I would advise that  they should  be married off. After they are married, they may, if they wish, live separately and may observe brahmacharya as much as they wish. But, before they are married, if they constantly think about each other, feel physical attraction towards each other and even occasionally touch each other with such feelings, that would definitely be against dharma. An engagement may be broken off, but a marriage cannot be  dissolved. If, therefore, there are occasions for them to  go  out  together, it is desirable that they should get married. Discuss this with Kaku and Lakshmi, and also with Nath.
How much would your sister need? Meet Jamnalalji and have a
 
 talk with him and afterwards take your sister to meet him. If she is not eager to earn money, if she wants to live a life dedicated to service and has no responsibility for supporting anybody, and if she is ready to follow the Ashram way of life, I think she can live in the Ashram. But this may not perhaps be possible for her at this age.
 Ask Gomati why she has stopped writing to me. I have not heard from Kishorelal of late.
 If  Manjulibtech_549_footnotelibtech_550_footnotewants  to   be   a   doctor   and   if   you   can   meet   her expenses, encourage her in her ambition. I don’t think it is a great achievement to be a doctor. All the same it is a form of education and one acquires knowledge. If she loves it, by all means let her have it.

379,,SIGNIFICANCE OF THE VARNA SYSTEM,"
      
 A student after reading my articlelibtech_551_footnotelibtech_552_footnoteon the system of the varnas writes.libtech_553_footnote
 Yes, I believe in the hereditary division into varnas. Had it not been so, the varna system would have had no meaning at all and serve no purpose. It would be mere jargon.
 The system of varnas is no man-made scheme. It emanates from the law of Nature or God. It rests with man whether or not to abide by the law. Hence, man’s individuality does not suffer in any way. Fire says you will burn yourself if you touch it. If we do not pay heed to what fire says and hold it in our hand just to assert individual freedom, we are bound to get burnt. The same applies to the law of varnas. The sages, at the end of their penances, realized that a class structure was essential for social progress and so brought about this division. It is left to us whether or not to accept it. No one is going to take us to task if we refuse to do it. But who can then stop Nature’s punishment? Why indeed call it punishment? Who can prevent what may be the
 
 natural consequence of not abiding by the laws of the varna system? So, the division into varnas can do no harm to individuality.
 But why should varnas be by birth? It is not something I have produced out of my pocket. Birth is at the very root of the varna system. The very name Brahmin is suggestive of the qualities expected of a Brahmin and one would prepare his progeny for them. The same is true of a Shudra. He will cultivate in his children the qualities expected of a Shudra. This is not to imply that a Shudra is not entitled to knowledge. The system of the varnas is necessarily related to livelihood. A person shall earn his livelihood only by pursuing the occupation of the varna in which he is born. There is no objection to one varna acquiring the knowledge of all the other varnas. For individual progress and protection of freedom, all people should have the qualities generally found in all the four varnas. But each man must especially develop the qualities of his own varna.
 The varna system emphasizes the curbing of material greed so that it can leave greater scope for spiritual development Material objects and material happiness are transitory. If man gets himself entangled in acquiring that alone, makes it the sole aim of his life, he will not be able to think about his soul. This does not in any way dampen human endeavour. When man does not have to go in search of means of livelihood, when means of livelihood are ready for him, all his efforts would be directed towards the spiritual quest. It is my firm conviction that by hitting upon the varnas the Hindus have made a great spiritual discovery, and have provided means for spiritual development. In course of time we forgot this fact and the varna system became disorganized. It reduced itself to touchability and untouchability and to restrictions on inter-dining and intermarriage. This resulted in its fall, viz., the confusion of the varnas. People lost themselves in encroaching upon the vocations of the other varnas. The Brahmin gave himself to greed and abandoned his duty as a Brahmin.
 If the sea catches fire, who shall put out that fire? If the salt loses its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? That is why Hindu dharma is in decline today.

380,,OBEDIENCE TO PARENTS,"
      
 It is one’s duty to obey one’s parents. They are one’s teachers. They are God. Shravana achieved his salvation by regarding his parents as God. While obeying his father’s orders, Rama gave up his kingdom. Now you say that untouchability is adharma, that Hinduism will perish if that blot is not washed off. To many of us what you say sounds true. But our parents do not accept it. As one of my friends undertook to do service to Harijans, his mother left her home and could be located only after midnight. She has returned home, but a great difficulty faces my friend. What should this friend do now? This must be the case with many young people.
 This is a summary of a letter. This is a real difficulty. I believe in devotion to parents. While my parents were alive, I conducted myself regarding Shravana as an ideal. I believe that whatever I have achieved is due to my devotion to my parents and the fruit of their blessings. Despite that, I think we can imagine circumstances in which disobe- dience to the orders of parents becomes one’s clear duty. Where the parents have been given the place of a teacher and of God, they have been thought of as perfect beings, so that to their offspring they are perfect. The children do not even entertain a doubt that what their parents say may be full of ignorance or error. They certainly are partial to their parents, because they desire their welfare. Where there exists a pure environment and the children have complete faith in their parents, the latter’s well-being consists in carrying out their parents’ orders.
 But when the children have a doubt, what is to be done? The parents say, ‘Drink liquor, eat carrion, offer bribes, secure that job by telling lies, one can speak an untruth in business, marry a nine-year old girl, there is sin in touching an untouchable,’ etc., etc.  What  should children do when such a situation arises? I think  that  the answer is provided in asking the question itself. When parents issue an order which appears to the children to be clearly an adharma, it is their dharma to disobey it. But where there is the slightest room for doubt as to what is right and what is wrong, it is one’s dharma to do one’s parents’ bidding. One cannot compare any other man’s word with that of one’s parents. In such circumstances, one has to follow one’s parents’ word only. Only he may disobey his parents who feels it incompatible with his dharma to obey them.
 But who can claim such religious prompting? An impudent, licentious or selfish son may get such an urge. But  he  does  not thereby acquire the right to disobey his parents. Only a son who has restraint, thoughtfulness, renunciation, forbearance, etc., who has known what it is to obey orders, who has clearly experienced religious awakening, may alone have the obligation to act contrary to his parents’ orders. Moreover, in an age of licentiousness and indepen- dence when many sons belittle their parents, it is difficult to say who disobeys his parents’ command regarding it his dharma to do so. But because of that we cannot observe their dharma. I believe he who observes the conditions which I have pointed out will not commit a mistake.
 Again, those young men and women, who act contrary to their parents’ wishes cannot claim the facilities of their parental homes and their parents’ money. They should be ready to give up home and wealth without hesitation and anger. Very often such conduct pro- duces a good effect. The parents’ opposition calms down. Where the parents are licentious and the son is restrained, one very often sees a change brought about in the parents. One cannot say this in regard to untouchability. Here both can be restrained. Both can regard their own conduct as dharma. Such honest differences may even endure. Here one can only expect that both will conduct themselves by tolera- ting mutual differences. Parents should not expect their grown-up sons or daughters always to obey them. And where the parents remain obdurate or threaten to kill themselves and so on, the youths who clearly know their dharma should thoughtfully observe it.

381,"April 9, 1933","NEW USAGES OF
TERMSlibtech_554_footnote","
      
 [April 9, 1933]
 From the point of view of the correspondentlibtech_555_footnotelibtech_556_footnotethere is some truth in what he says, from my point of view there is none. I have given words a wider meaning, no doubt, but I have not rejected the popular meaning. The correspondent gives up the popular meaning, and tries to accept mine. This attempt itself is misguided. If we give up the popular meaning, what meaning can we expand? I have faith also in stone and other images. The fact is that language can never comp- letely express human thoughts. So, the meanings of words continue to expand. It is impossible, it is unnecessary, to coin new words for every sense. When the same word is used to convey opposite ideas, there is a definite danger of ambiguity and absurdity. There is no such danger here as I have only expanded the popular meaning. In fact, it is not an expansion but a clarification of the meaning. The popular meaning tells us that the stone is God. But the correct idea is not that the stone is God but that God pervades the stone. People might say that if there is God in the stone, why should we not regard the stone as God? The body is not the soul, but the soul dwells in the body. Yet millions say and believe that the body itself is the soul. It is of course true from their point of view, or rather, there is an element of truth even in what they think. It means that the popular meaning does not deserve to be abandoned altogether. As a concept grows wider, the meaning of the term would go on expanding too. What I am doing is nothing new. My ideas themselves may strike one as something new. This is inevitable because that is my sadhanalibtech_557_footnotelibtech_558_footnote. One has to think in the search for Truth. The narrow meaning does not satisfy. With contemplation the same meanings of the same words are found satisfying. It is said that the Vedas are but an expansion of Om. Tulsidas says that Rama himself is Om, Rama himself is the Vedas. Rama includes everything. He alone is, all else is illusion. But the Rama of the people is only a son of Dasharatha. Tulsidas says: “My Rama may be Dasharatha’s
 
 son but He is also much more: He  is  Sachchidananda Purnabrahma.” There is no contradiction in this at all. It is the broadening of an idea, expansion of a meaning. Tulsidas meditated and in his meditation had a vision of the flawless, formless, all-pervading Rama. This has not led to any absurdity. On  the contrary, we have a better understanding of the significance of the avatars. It has brought peace to our mind and heart. And we also realize how Rama has come to be known as more than Dasharatha’s son. Similarly, let us proceed from the stone to the atom and we have endless images. And we see God hidden even in the atom. Hence, the whole world is given to image-worship. The place in which the image of Jagannatha is installed is a Jagannatha temple. And the place where a few persons sit together and pray to God is also a temple. So a tem- ple is an integral part not only of Hindu dharma but of religion as such—one may call it a church or a mosque, a gurudwara or an upa- shrayalibtech_559_footnotelibtech_560_footnote. As long as the body and the soul are related, temple and God will always stay together. The body is a fountain of filth as well as an abode of God. Similarly, a temple can also become a den of vice, and it is already an abode of God. “As is one’s faith, so is one’s gain.”

  	You have acted like a child who, forbidden to touch a centipede, 	tries to catch a snake.

  	I have your letter. I am glad you wrote. Even if only a handful of 	workers show extreme humility on the one hand and firmness even to 	the extent of being ready to lay down their lives and sacrifice 	their all on the other, the demon of untouchability is bound to 	perish.  Vandemataram 	from  MOHANDAS  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 4140           April 	9, 1933    CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	I got today the post despatched by you on the 7th and  despatched 	today’s post from here after reading it.  	Parachure Shastri had joined the Ashram for a three-year course of 	training with a view to doing Ashram work. His aim and mine was that 	he and his co-workers should work according to the ideals of the 	Ashram. Though, unfortunately, he had to leave before completing the 	period, he did Ashram work to the best of his ability and that is 	why I look upon him as an inmate of the Ashram. Here the phrase 	“inmate of the Ashram” is not interpreted literally. The meaning 
 which I have given to it is wider, and not narrower, than the literal meaning. Did you read what I wrote in my letter to Duncan? According to me, he has already become an inmate of the Ashram. If he were to find himself in a difficult plight anywhere while doing public work, I would invite him to the Ashram. Wherever he goes, he will keep up his connection with the Ashram. I believe Parachure Shastri has done so. Some workers at Chinchvad also may. I would not say that about everyone who joins the weaving school. Some of them give up the Ashram way of life altogether after they have learnt weaving and work only for a living. If you are still not convinced, ask me again.
 I accept all your criticism of Narahari’s letter. I had observed the harshness of his language which you have noticed. But I ignored it and paid attention only to his motive and his suggestions. I read it as I would have done if it were written about me. I would ignore harsh language used by anybody about me. I, therefore, paid no attention to Narahari’s harsh language about you.  Moreover, I know his temperament. Your dharma is to disregard the language used about you. If your correspondent’s motive is not malicious and if his suggestions deserve consideration, we should think about them. This is the way of non-violence. It is the swan’s manner. “The creator has made all things, animate and inanimate, full of virtues and defects. The good follow the example of the swan and accept the milk of virtues and leave the water of defects.” Unless one acts thus, one cannot attain goodness and truth or preserve them for long even if attained. We may observe other people’s defects, but it is for the spotless Brahman alone, and not for an imperfect man, to judge them. Man is described by some as an embodiment of imperfections. You must not, therefore, get disheartened. I close this chapter here for today.
I  have already written to you about	libtech_561_footnote.  I  have no hope that
 any of them will continue to live in the Ashram. They cannot endure the strict discipline of the Ashram rules. I, therefore, believe that they have decided to leave the Ashram after considering their capacity. They have also no respect for you and no faith in you, but I would not mind that. I would urge you, too, not to mind it, but when the truth is that they lack the strength or the will (the two things, ultimately mean the same) to observe the Ashram rules, both they and
 
 
 the Ashram would feel suffocated if they continued to live in it. I think both . . .libtech_562_footnotelibtech_563_footnoteand . . .libtech_564_footnotelibtech_565_footnotecan support themselves. If . . .libtech_566_footnotelibtech_567_footnotewere not ill, she, too, is fully capable of supporting herself. Perhaps their capacities will grow outside the Ashram and they will do quite well. They cannot conform to the mould of the Ashram life. If you believe otherwise and can tempt them to continue to live there, I should certainly be happy. I feel that their leaving the Ashram means my doing so. It has  a serious implication for me, but their remaining in  the  Ashram against their will or in an unnatural manner would be unbearable to me and also contrary to dharma.
 We could not do anything here except keep a fast to mark the commencement of the National Week.
I have not received Valji’s article mentioned in your letter.
 Perhaps I will get it tomorrow.
   [PS.]  BAPU   In my 	ignorance, I have committed myself to the Board here to 
  	supply 25 Gandiva spinning-wheels at 12 annas each. After making the 	promise, I asked Lakshmidas the price of the wheel and he informed 	me that it was a rupee and a half. But I must supply 25 	spinning-wheels. I had written to Keshu about this in one of my 	letters. But he has now left. I don’t know if there is anybody now 	in the factory who can attend to such work. If  the  spinning-wheels 	 cannot be manufactured there, request Lakshmidas to manufacture and 	send them. If they cost more than 12 annas each, he should recover 	the balance from the Ashram. Each spinning-wheel must be fitted with 	a spindle-bearer, a spindle and a spring. The spinning- wheel which 	I had made in jail is there. The new ones should be as simple. They 	need not be varnished. There should be a hook at the top, so that 	the spinning-wheel can be hung up on a wall after the work is over. 	The hook can be made of tin sheet. Or a hole may be made and a 	string may be tied into a loop. The wheel need not have a steel 	axle. The one sent to me by Keshu does not have it. In the 	spinning-wheel which we used in the beginning, there were only two 	nails in the wheel. I have done plenty of spinning on such a 	spinning-wheel. It will be enough if they are not carelessly made 	and if they work smoothly. The freight will be paid by the Board.    
 Wherever you get the spinning-wheel manufactured, they should be ready soon. If you have not followed any point, ask me to explain. Show this letter to Lakshmidas.

386,"April 9, 1933",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
      
 April 9, 1933
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 The packet which I despatched yesterday contained a report of discussion arising out of . . .’slibtech_568_footnoteaffair along with two letters relating to it, a letter from Mary with my reply to her and a copy of the same for being preserved there.
 I very much liked Marybehn’s letter. I am sure you will understand my reply to her. If all of you like her nature, respect her wish. But before you do that let all the inmates of the Ashram meet together and think about the suggestion independently. None of you need think that my view has to be accepted. You will see that I have made that clear in my letter to Marybehn also.
 You will find with this a letter from Jekibehnlibtech_569_footnote. Her sons have grown up now. They can be easily looked after there. If you can keep them in the Ashram, write to Manibhailibtech_570_footnoteand  ask  him  to  send  them over. Ask him also to send the estimated expenses on their account. libtech_571_footnote
If we only would, all of us have much to learn from the cases of	libtech_572_footnotelibtech_573_footnote.
 ...libtech_574_footnotehad to leave the Ashram because he  repeatedly  violated  the Ashram rules. ...libtech_575_footnotedid not observe the Ashram rules and has also realized that he will not be able to observe them in future. He has not observed any of the rules till now and will not be able to observe them in future, and so the whole family is leaving the Ashram.    libtech_576_footnotewas the
 
 pillar of the Ashram. Without him, the Ashram would not have come into existence at all. It is a painful and serious thing that his family should leave the Ashram. But I believe all the same that it is necessary for the sake of dharma that they should leave. We will not cease to love them for having left the Ashram. We will continue to take interest in them wherever they are. We should wish that, even though they live away from the Ashram, they will observe its rules to the best of their ability and will never do anything to bring shame on the Ashram.
 I do wish that nobody will feel superior and think that they were not perfect because they left and that those who have not left are so. Those who leave can be morally worthier than those who remain. The imperfections of those who are leaving became known to all, but who knows the imperfections of the others which may have remained unknown? We should not sit in judgment over anybody. God alone knows who is good and who is bad.
 We should learn a lesson from these instances and wake up. No one should conceal his shortcomings. Everybody should  become more vigilant. Let nobody do anything out of false  shame. One should do only what one spontaneously can, and if anyone cannot observe the Ashram rules or does not wish to do so, it would be better for them to leave. All of us are imperfect, but if, knowing imperfec- tions, we constantly strive to follow the Ashram ideals and do not hide our shortcomings, we are fit to live in the Ashram. We should, how- ever, leave if we do not wish to follow those ideals or have no faith in them.
 If you circulate the foregoing among all friends there, it will suffice. If you wish to suggest any changes in what I have written, you may do so.

Yes, I do say that a person who cannot give up eating flesh 	may eat the flesh of a slaughtered animal. Of course it cannot be 	that a person accustomed to eating flesh will eat only carrion.

I   would   not   have   you   to   infer   from    my    defencelibtech_593_footnoteof Hardayalbabu that I would write exactly as he 	did. I hope you saw my articlelibtech_594_footnotein the  Harijan on Brahmins. That explains my 	own personal position. I am wholly averse to a crusade against 	Brahmins or any particular class. I fear that we are all tarred with 	the same brush so far as this monster of untouchability is 	concerned.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a microfilm: 	S.N. 20888

 MY DEAR ANNADABABU,
 I was delighted to hear from you and still more so to learn that Suresdalibtech_595_footnotehad improved wonderfully, so much so as to enable him to go to Kurseong for a change. It would be a matter of great joy for us all if he is completely restored at Kurseong.
 I note what you say about the Free Press correspondent. It was not possible to give the Free Press the messages that I used to give to the A.P.libtech_596_footnoteOtherwise too, I was so dissatisfied with the utterly reckless manner in which they published misstatements that I did not care to give any such facilities to the Free Press.

 DEAR SATISBABU,
 There is no doubt about it that untouchability works nowhere so cruelly as in the South. That in the South all the non-Brahmins are not classed as untouchables has a historical reason. But in its working it is the same, whether you call them untouchables or not; and hence it is that you find in Madras alone non-Brahmin constituencies. Therefore in Madras you have reservation of seats for non-Brahmins and untouchables instead of merely untouchables, and the feeling between Brahmins and non-Brahmins runs much higher and keener than between touchables and untouchables. In Bengal no doubt things are bad enough and need to be mended. The untouchables in Bengal
 
 would feel the irritation just as much as the untouchables in Madras, for they know nothing worse. But when we begin to set up comparisons we have to admit that the Madras pattern is infinitely worse than the Bengal one, and if you went to Madras and studied the question you will immediately say, ‘Bad as things are with us in Bengal, they are infinitely worse in Madras.’ Therefore I want you to work away against untouchability in Bengal as unremittingly as you have begun, but at the same time avoid comparison with the other Provinces and be more than fair in your judgment of the sanatanists.
 Yours sincerely,

          CHI. 	MIRA,           April 	11, 1933 
  	Your long letter came yesterday. Your argument appeals to me. Women 	themselves have resisted the argument that you  have advanced. I 	have believed it always that man is the aggressor. He is more 	sensual than woman. I have therefore no difficulty in following your 	argument. But the corollary you draw defies experience. It has been 	happy where it has worked. But they are rare cases and will always 	be so—nor is it unfortunate. The usual condition is marriage and 	procreation. That means breach of brahmacharya as we know it. 	That does not mean that we should not aim at it. We must aim at it 	even though there may be only one case of perfect brahmacharya 	out of the experiment. Many attempt, only a few will attain 	salvation. Therefore generally we shall have to be satisfied with 	married people growing to brahmacharya and a few only being 	life brahmacharis.  If I am right, the Ashram will have to be 	what it is, always rising higher after every failure. . .libtech_599_footnotelibtech_600_footnoteand 	. . . are infinitely better for having lived in the Ashram nor is 	the Ashram any the worse for their having lived in it. They would 	easily have been much better if I had been  less imperfect and more 	wise and for that matter the other elders. But I was their 	foot-rule, so imperfect and untrue. Yet I do not consider myself an 	unsafe guide because I am not consciously untruthful and always 	attempt to discover and throw away my imperfections. All I say is 	that failures there must be so long as we have not in our midst a 	perfect man or woman. But we need not lose hope nor become unnerved 	on discovering instances like . . .’s; they are attempts of the 	system to throw off impurities. I rejoice at the discovery, while I 	deplore . . .’s error, even as I would rejoice at the discovery of 	a disease in my own body, though I may deplore it. Further than this 	I cannot carry this tremendous problem—‘one step enough for me, 	I do not ask to see the distant scene’. We know the fundamental 	truth we want to reach, we know also the way. The details we do not 	know, we shall never know them all, because we are but very humble 	instruments among millions of such moving consciously or 	unconsciously towards the divine event. We shall reach the Absolute 	Truth, if we will faithfully    
 and steadfastly work out the relative truth as each one of us knows it. Ba wants her letter separately because of the separate delivery.
According to the date of the delivery of my letter to her, the fortnight
 is not yet complete. I do not understand this intricate working of the jail regulations. It differs in every jail evidently. But that ought not to cause any worry. The philosophy of prison life is that the body  belongs to the keeper, i. e., the State. Therefore generally speaking it may be said that a prisoner is foolish who worries about exterior wants the supply of which depends wholly upon the keeper’s will. Thus everything given to a prisoner is a concession which may  be withdrawn at the will of the State. Domestic letters fall under that category. We may thankfully receive and write them so long as they are allowed but we may not foam or fret or curse, if we are not allowed to do so. Regularity of delivery we may prize but irregularity ought not to unhinge us. Those who are prisoners for conscience’ sake should at least grasp this very simple but not generally understood truth. If you can explain it to Ba, you should do so.
 I shall see about the delivery of Hindi Harijan. My weight is steady at 104.

 From the certificates enclosed by you it would appear that you do not belong to the Harijan class, and if you do not, no part of the donation of the Rs. 500 referred to in your letter will be available to you, but there is no reason why the general funds of the Society should not be used for the purpose indicated in your letter.

      THE 	SECRETARY 	TO THE GOVERNMENT 	OF BOMBAY 	HOME 	DEPARTMENT  DEAR 	SIR,  April 	12, 1933 
  	I have just read the Government’s reply to my request contained in 	my letterlibtech_605_footnoteof 	the 1st instant.     
 I am thankful for the correction that it was not in 1922 but in 1923 that I was permitted to see two fellow-convicts in the Yeravda prison who were fasting.
 I am sorry for the decision of the Government on the issue raised by me.
 Technically the Government are right in their reply. Naturally every concession lapses with the end of the prisoner’s incarceration. The limits of the current concessions I have not questioned, though I did not like them in so far as the inquiry about the treatment or conduct of other prisoners was concerned. Happily there was no occasion for definitely raising the point. My endeavour has been to avoid, as far as possible, occasion of conflict with authority. I have been content to live, as becomes a prisoner, a hand-to-mouth existence in the hope that with the march of time my conduct would inspire the Government with confidence in my desire to tender and promote prison discipline to the best of my ability and thus make my way smooth for humanitarian work that was possible for me even as a prisoner to do. And I may be pardoned for referring to a policy once established by the Government and pleading for its continuity.
 But the Government would on the contrary seem to repent of past concessions and to want to curtail them. For the communication under reply says, “Government are unable to extend this concession so as to cover direct communications between him and prisoners in jails other than Yeravda.” Does this mean that I am not now to exchange communications which I have hitherto carried on with prisoners in jails other than Yeravda, and that in cases such as Seth Poonamchand’s I am not to be permitted to offer friendlyintervention? I can only hope that the Government do not mean to curtail or restrict the concession already granted to me. I request an early reply as even the concession granted in the matter of Seth Poonamchand has not, in my opinion, been properly given effect to.
 Yours sincerely,

I should be sorry indeed if it was a fact  	that  the  other agencies working for the service of the Harijans 	had materially weakened because of the existence of the Bombay 	Branch. I would like you to throw more light on it. And you mystify 	me by saying that you will ‘have to be satisfied with such 	opportunities to serve as Dr. Ambedkar allows and gives you’. 	Whatever the difference as to the way of working between Dr. 	Ambedkar and others, surely the goal is the same except for the fact 	that Dr. Ambedkar would not be satisfied with anything less than 	destruction of varnashrama, but there is absolutely common ground so 	far as destruction of untouchability in the sense of out-casteness 	is concerned.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I am grateful to you for your very long and reasoned letter. But that letter does not convince me of the necessity of untouchability, as we observe it today, for any beneficial purpose whatsoever, and you seem to give up your case when you suggest that common temples may be built which would be accessible to all classes of Hindus so that in time to come people may forget the artificial distinctions that are observed today.
 So far as the four divisions are concerned, I am wholly at one with you if you agree that they are designed to regulate the duties of the four divisions and not to set up grades of superiority and inferi- ority nor to erect impassable barriers as to inter-dining and intermar- riage.

420,"April 	12, 1933",LETTER TO N.,"
        MY 	DEAR N.,           April 	12, 1933 
  	After having kept me waiting for four days and holding me in 	suspense, you have given me a long letter.  	I do not like the boil on your left foot and right leg. I hope that 	you know the simple treatment of boils and that by the time this 	reaches you, nothing will have been left of them. It is much better 	to stop all work than to run the risk of dirt getting into them when 	they appear on inconvenient parts of the body. If you do not know 	simple treatment of simple diseases, you have got to learn it 	quickly. Truly, this new life is a new birth for you. May you come 	safely through it. As 	for Slibtech_610_footnotelibtech_611_footnote. I do not know what you mean by giving him another     
 chance. I hope you have written to him strongly about his unwarrantable familiarity. Unless he is truly repentant, nothing whatsoever can be accepted from him, and it would not be proper to accept his mere word in order to enable you to receive a gift from him. It is demoralizing to receive gifts from those whom you want to reform or from those with whom we had questionable relationship. Therefore S. may have all the chances for showing his repentance. Nothing whatsoever should be received from him, or, for that matter from   Rlibtech_612_footnotelibtech_613_footnote.   The   only   person   whom   I   regard   as   quite   reliable   is Ramachandra. Get everything you need from him and no one else. I shall write to Ramachandra to look to your wants. He told me that in reply to your letter asking for soap, he offered to send you  a remittance so as to enable you to buy soap locally. This was meant to save railage for a small parcel. The local purchases you could only do if you knew the bazaar prices or if you had a reliable person who would not cheat you. Somehow or other I do not feel quite safe about Rlibtech_614_footnotelibtech_615_footnote. He is for me an unknown quantity. He may be a very good man, only I do not feel quite safe.
 This brings me to soap. For cleaning the body, as I told you when you were with me, no soap was required. Clean water and a rough towel is all that is necessary for keeping the body quite fit. For washing the hair there is nothing to approach the soap-nut. It is to be had all over India. A few nuts soaked overnight and then well mashed with hand in the water produces soap suds with which you can clean the hair perfectly. But I have an easier method. You have abandoned everything for the Harijan service and for self-purification. Hence, you are, to all intents and purposes, a sannyasin. Therefore you have to remove the hair from your head and have a close crop almost amounting to a shave. Mira has that. Tens of thousands of widows have that crop. If you can easily let your hair go, I need not prescribe elaborate things for keeping your hair in a clean condition. I do not want to press for the crop. I do not know what attraction your hair has for you. Much as I would like every girl in the Ashram to have her hair cropped, I have been able to persuade only a few. If you have the same partiality for your hair as these Ashram girls have, I have nothing to say. But if you would let your hair go as easily as you pare your nails, then I would say: Get hold of the closest barber, get him to
 
 wash his hands and his scissors in hot water and get him to take off your hair. If he has not the clippers, then let him do so with the ordinary scissors. It won’t be as close a crop as I would like, but it would be close enough to save you all the anxiety about your hair and it would save you also a great deal of time. If you do not want your hair to be cropped, I must write to you in my next letter what you should do to keep it clean without having to resort to soap. Remember that millions in this country do not know what soap is. Again, in asking you practically to do without soap, I am asking you to do something I have not succeeded in inducing all the Ashram people to do.
 Now for the washing of the clothes. I wonder  if  you  have enough firewood to heat your water. If you are a bit of an engineer, you can even heat your water by the sun-heat. It requires a metal pot and a bit of piping undoubtedly. An American educational missio- nary, Sam Higginbottom, is heating his water by the sun-heat in Allahabad. But this is not yet for you. I am simply whetting your appetite for doing simple things in the villages. But if you can heat your water all you need to do is to obtain the crude washing soda. Add that to your water and it becomes as soft as soap water. Soak your clothes in that water while it is boiling and let them lie in that water overnight. Wash them well the next morning and they are free from dirt though not white as snow, because they take somewhat the colouring of the crude soda. But that should not matter and is in keeping with the village life. But the clothes will be as clean as if washed in a first-class hotel in America, and all you  want  is cleanliness.
 The change you have made in your apparel seems to me to be quite suitable. You have almost anticipated me if the robe  is  in addition to the skirt I have mentioned in my letter. You are hard on poor Ramachandra. I think that his remark was well meant. Your argument about the women is quite logical, but unfortunately we are not governed by logic. I must not enter into the history of the women whom you see bare-bodied. You will however realize at once that you cannot afford to vie with these sisters. Truth demands that your external appearance should be as near a representation as possible of the internal condition. You cannot afford today to claim unassailable internal innocence. When you have attained it, you won’t need to demonstrate it. Do you know the story of Shukdevji and Vyas? If you don’t, you must ask me to give it to you some other day.
 I am not at all satisfied about your food. The ragi bread should go. You must have got whole wheatmeal flour by this time. If you have, you must bake your own chappati. If you have not got that, you should live on milk and such dried fruit as you might have. It would keep you in good health and give you the needed energy. Milk for yourself you should beg, if the people will willingly supply to you. Buffalo milk is fairly rich and if you get one pound, it will serve the purpose. Of course S.’slibtech_616_footnoteportion is a first charge. Whatever fruit and vegetables you may get now and again will really be enough to give you the necessary vegetable salts and vitamins. So far as health is concerned, a daily supply of fresh vegetables and fruit is not an absolute necessity, especially when you are living out in the open air and are not called upon to undergo extraordinary physical or mental strain.
 You must control your temper, even with reference to S. You should be patient with the people who surround your little cottage and would not let you have even a little bit of privacy when you want to sleep. A little reasoning with them will set them right. Whilst you are still becoming inured to your new life, you should insist on taking an hour’s sleep during the middle of the day and giving it to S. It will be good for your body and good for your temper, and if you and S. have a close crop, you will use a wet rag for the head, as you saw me use. It cools the head and the whole body instantaneously.
 You should have sent me R.’s letter as he wrote it. Let me know him as he is and not as you would have him to appear.
I think I have covered all the points in your letter.
 May God the Truth surround you and S. with His protecting care. I know that if you will have complete faith in Him, it will be all well with you. Here is a note for S.libtech_617_footnote

  	After  reading   Kamalnayan’slibtech_618_footnoteletter,  I   feel   that,  if   you   can become 	free from the work at Wardha, you should immediately go to  a hill 	station. I like Mahabaleshwar the best. You can stay there for a 	full one month and a half. After that you can descend to Panchgani 	or go to any other place if you wish. You should not remain in the 	plains so long as the discharge from the ear continues.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 2913           April 	12, 1933  CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	I got your weekly post. I found Smt. Dhanvanti’slibtech_619_footnoteletter, but did not find Valjibhai’s article. If 	you did send it, it seems to have been lost in the office here. I 	hope he has kept a copy. If it has not been left behind there, write 	to Valji and inform him, so that time may be saved. He should know 	that this is a jail.  	Vaseline will help Amina better than ghee can. She should thoroughly 	mix a little boric acid powder with it.  	I cannot take the final decision about Dhiru, since I do not know 	him well. Only you and others there who have known him for many 	years can do so. He has studied under Panditji. Probably Narahari 	also knows him well. He is working at present under your  direct 	supervision. If what he writes to me can be trusted, it is our duty 	to let him go. But we cannot do that if we have the slightest doubt 	about him. Whether or not Santiniketan is a suitable place for him 	may be doubtful, but we have no choice in the matter. Besides, there 	is no doubt that they teach painting well there. Whether Dhiru will 	use his skill well or not will depend entirely on his character. I 	cannot judge whether he is a boy of good character, whether he is 	hard-working     
 and whether he has any aptitude for painting. After writing a long letter to me, he has kept silent. I don’t feel very happy about that. But it is possible that he has not written again because of shyness or out of respect for me.
 It is desirable that everybody should keep silent for some time after prayer or talk only in whispers. A person may speak about Ashram work, however. In army barracks, soldiers are not permitted to talk after the bell for retiring is sounded. In any case there should be no murmuring immediately after the prayer. This is necessary for the good of the boys as well as of the Ashram. This rule  is  strictly enforced in jails. Were it not so, life in a jail would be intolerable. In jails even lights are generally put out at a fixed hour. And talking in loud voices is never permitted. If, therefore, you can introduce a rule that people should be silent or talk only in whispers, you should do so immediately.
 
   [PS.]  BAPU   I  	suppose you  have  read  Dr.   Sharma’s  letter.   Welcome him 
  	heartily when he comes. His daughter also should be welcomed. Give 	him the necessary facilities for his experiments. His letters carry 	a very good impression of him.  	I have had no comments from you recently regarding the effect of the 	changes in food. Let me know the results. Nobody should be forced to 	accept these changes. If anybody desires some modification, grant 	his request within our limits. Chhotubhai has written to me about 	this. Read my reply to him.  BAPU  From 	a microfilm of the Gujarati: M.M.U./I.

425,"April 	12, 1933",LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK,"
         CHI. 	PREMA,         April 	12, 1933 
  	I have your letter. It is enough that I have cautioned you. Your 	belief that I do not read your letters carefully is not correct. I 	had fully understood what you had said. Such cock-sureness is itself 	a sign of pride. The pride shows in your language. This does not 	mean that I 
 want you to hide your thoughts or express them in carefully chosen words. I like you to write as you feel. According to me it is your virtue that you let me see you as you are both  inwardly  and  outwardly. If you were to write with unnatural self-control, I would be helpless and unable to advise or admonish you.
 I cannot teach you to become humble as a dust particle. If one understands what God is, one naturally feels like that. That understanding will come to you in its own time.
 Nor do I mean that you do not have to endure many things from others. But the fact that you can wipe out all that in a moment makes me unhappy.
 You believe that an atmosphere of prejudice against you has been created around me. You are mistaken in this. Sardar is certainly not against you. Do not take his humour as a sign of his being against you. I do not at all feel that Mahadev is against you either. What Chhaganlal has said against you is nothing new. He knows your worth, but says that till you can control your tongue you should be entrusted with no responsibility. This is his old complaint. You should know that I rarely talk with my three companions. There is, except for a little joking at meal times or during walks, no time for any discussion. We rarely talk about anybody unless there is an occasion to do so. With all my work, I never feel in a mood for talking about other things, nor could I waste my time in idle discussions. I have hardly been able to discuss even the painful episode of . . .libtech_620_footnoteand       libtech_621_footnote. I have
 contented myself with the briefest exchange of views. There is no atmosphere of prejudice against you around me, nor is there any such prejudice in my mind. If I admonish you rather harshly, it is because I regard you as my daughter and want to see you perfect. Why, then, do you feel hurt by my criticism? You may accept such of it as you think worth accepting and forget the rest. For it is perfectly possible that my criticism may be based on ignorance and that I may  not  have  correctly understood what you said.
 It is quite true that different people may see the same thing differently. We daily observe that the same energy or strength is used in different ways.
 I do feel that no woman should be asked by others to do any routine work during her menses. Nobody can know when she may be
 
 having a pain. It would be best not to burden a woman with any work during such a period. She may do of her own free will whatever work she feels inclined to do. Some women feel nothing during menstruation and go on doing their work as usual. Some others feel unbearable pain. Some don’t feel any pain, but can do no physical work. A woman who spends the period in the right manner gains fresh energy every month. Those three or four days are for getting back lost strength, and for that the woman should be left free from all responsibility. She should be free to lie down if she wants to. Some ignorant women do not lay aside their hectic domestic work even during that period, not knowing the harm which they do themselves. They should be properly advised. On the whole, therefore, I like Lakshmidas’s suggestion.
 What you say about Kisan is possible. I was very glad to learn that she had recovered. She seems to have waited for my reply to her letter. But I do not remember having not replied to any of her letters.
I have already written to you about your slivers.
 You will not lose weight by living on unboiled milk. If you eat boiled vegetables once a day, I am sure you will benefit. Probably your throat needs them; I think it does unboiled milk. Why not try?

426,,LETTER TO C. F. ANDREWS,"
           MY 	DEAR CHARLIE,    April 	13, I 933 
  	You will see in this week’s  Harijan  a 	replylibtech_622_footnotelibtech_623_footnoteto your difficulty about the fast. I shall anxiously 	await your criticism. The story of Nineveh came into my hands quite 	accidentally, but it fitted in so well I thought.  	In your letter of 22nd March you have asked a question about Dr. 	Subbaroyan’s Bill. As soon as I got the Bill I felt the difficulty 	about a fair majority myself and I brought it up to 	Rajagopalachari’s notice. I had suggested too an amendment even to 	the extent of three-fourths majority being required, because my idea 	always has    
 been that unless the majority is a very decisive majority,  the  big  reform contemplated could not work satisfactorily, and you must have seen how I have contemplated meeting the objection even of a minority of one, because what might be superstition to me may be a matter of life and death to that minority of one. His particular temple might be all-in-all to him and it might be his absolute faith that the temple will be no good to him if he had to offer worship side by side with a Harijan. But all these things are to be done when the proper time arrives. I have discussed them publicly too, but I do not want to reopen the discussion because nobody thinks of it just now. But you can have the assurance and give it to those who need it that when the Bill reaches the Committee stage an amendment for  a  decisive majority will certainly be carried, and any other  amendment  that might satisfy the sanatanists and that could leave the principle intact will most decidedly be accepted.
 Mahadev has not yet made any guess about the name you have for me. I have no doubt that you have many names and not only one. Thangai naturally would want to say nothing to me about your
capacity for taking in dates because she knows that there at least I
could always beat you and not by a bare majority.
 About under-stamping of the envelope, there was no economy, false or otherwise, possible for us. Not having been ever a prisoner, you evidently fancy that we are free to do as we like even to the extent of putting on stamps. You may then know that stamps are not affixed by us. They are affixed in the prison office.
Love from us all.
 Yours sincerely,

 April 13, 1933
I have your two letters.
 You often ask me to pray for you, pray for your mother. Up to now I have never said anything about this. But today I feel tempted to put my position before you. Though I believe in temples, I do not
 visit them nowadays, and, as you know, the temple at the Ashram has the sky above as the roof and mother earth as the floor. The walls consist of the four directions. And in this temple there are no prayers offered for friends. The morning and the evening prayers consist of set verses in Sanskrit and hymns from a composite hymn book in Gujarati, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Urdu and English, the latter only when there is someone who can sing English hymns. My response therefore to requests from friends for intercessory prayers consists simply in there and then silently commending them to God. I do not know that this would be considered at all an adequate response. But I can truthfully do no otherwise. Prayer to God with me has a different meaning perhaps from the ordinary. He needs no asking. He reads our hearts even as we do not read them. He anticipates our demands and wishes. He knows what is good for us much better than we do. He has no hesitation in summarily rejecting our wishes and desires which in His estimation are unlawful. Having all this belief in me I have not the heart to approach Him with special prayers and hence there is not that definite asking as there is with so many Christian friends, and even Hindu friends. I do not want to imply that what I am doing is better than, say, what you are doing. Each one approaches God after his own manner and each manner is equally acceptable to Him if it proceeds from the heart. I thought that I would just say this much in answer to all the love you are pouring on me.
 Yours,

 DEAR SISTER,
 I must answer your latest letter. Your account of your visit to Geneva is most interesting and I am glad that you made so many acquaintances.
 And now you want me to give you an Indian name. There was a meaning in Mirabehn asking for an Indian name, having physically cast in her lot with Indians, but what is the meaning of your wanting an Indian name? Nobody will address you by that name. I therefore think that you should give up this desire for having an Indian name. It is enough that you have an Indian heart.
 I hope that the quiet you were contemplating to have did you good. Of course the real thing is to find one’s quiet from within. Then and then only are we quite safe.
Please remember me to all those friends whom you mention.

 MY DEAR MARGARETE,
 Your letter of 20th March is disturbing. Everything done in a hurry generally proves unsatisfactory when it is not positively harmful. All haste must be deprecated. From the highest standpoint, and that is the only one I am sure which you want to  apply  to  yourself, your coming will be justified only when you are ready for the Ashram life. That clearly you are not. Your immediate duty is to be by your mother’s side. You cannot risk bringing her to India. If you are thrown out of employment and have to be in search of one, you have to courageously stand by your people and suffer the hardships that they will have to suffer, and if you have imbibed the fundamentals of the Ashram life, you might even render inestimable help to them. All your letters to 24 people in India, therefore, to get you a job should not have been written. You do not want a job in India, but you want to give your free service, the whole of yourself, to India. You cannot do two contrary things at the same time. I wish therefore you would give up the idea of the job, remain there by your mother’s side and live the Ashram life there, so that if God wills it, He will send you some day to the Ashram.

If such a condensation is possible and if you could publish it, I have no doubt that it would be a guide for the workers, and possibly to the other municipalities .

 CHI. JAMNADAS,
 I got your letter. You have described things very vividly. It is of course a hard task, but persist in your efforts. Don’t worry about the result. You should not worry if the temple is situated at some distance. Actually there will be an advantage in having it at some distance. Though very few Harijans may visit it now, large crowds of them will visit it by and by if there is a school, etc., attached to it. One may take the children to the temple for darshan in the evening. And the elders might visit it on holidays. For example, Jagannath and Bhutnath temples were at one time considered to be far way. They are probably considered quite near now. So let this new temple also be thought distant. The temple should stand on a large plot of land. According to me, even ten acres would not be enough.
 I feel worried about your bad health. There is a connection between it and your mind. You alone can cure it. You should do so. I want you to do so.
 I should like you to write to me more frequently, so that I might be kept acquainted with your work and the state of your mind.

 BHAI NANALAL,
 I have your letter. I have been thinking a great deal about this matter. I think Ratilal has consented only to a division of the property. Chhaganlal need not be blamed. He has no control over his mind at all, and so Maganlal is naturally afraid. If the property is divided, something at least may be saved. If it is kept undivided, there is a danger of all of it being lost. If my first suggestion is accepted and implemented, the property may remain undivided, but nobody seems inclined to accept it. It was that all the three brothers should keep away for five years and leave the management of the property to trustees, accepting for themselves fixed allowances. More when we meet.
 Jamnadas seems to be a fine worker. He seems to be managing the branch office there admirably. If he has produced the same impression on you, please relieve his anxiety about money. He has been worrying so much that it has told on his health.

 CHI. SUBHADRA, SARALA AND JAYADEVI,
 How can I say to you, you will reap as you sow? The sanatanists say: ‘The Harijans reap as they sow. How can we commit the sin of helping them to improve their condition in disregard of that law?’ If I were to apply the sanatanists’ logic to you, I would have to demolish
 
 the little nest I have built for the Harijans. Since I can’t do that, you are safe. According to the sanatanists’ idea of justice, since you wrote your letter with a lead pencil, I should reply with a pencil made of stone, shouldn’t I? But our aim is to win over even the sanatanists. But you have shown that you deserve Nandubehn’s description of you.libtech_630_footnoteAs soon as you were out, you showed your nature. You started straight away drinking leaf-water. And dry leaves at that!libtech_631_footnoteI must say Chinese bullocks are better than Kathiawari bullocks. They also drink leaf-water but the leaves are green. If you again run away to the cattle-pen in a huff, Sardar is generous and will forgive your getting angry and so you need not be afraid.
 In one sense the description given by Nandubehn seems to be perfectly apt. Has anybody ever heard of cows, bullocks, horses and other animals worrying? If animals had knowledge, they would be no less than yogis. It is said that yoga is extremely difficult for men to practise, but that it is part of women’s nature. If a woman gives up ignorant attachment, she could easily be a yogini. But all of you are only learned animals!!! Remember that if you squander away  the health cultivated in the yoga school by eating all kinds of sweets, you will deserve to be punished for that.
 In your next letter describe some other doings of yours, namely, what you read, etc.
 I am helpless about Manibehn. I write to her, but she does not get my letters. After all there must be some indications that one is a prisoner.
 Kevalrambhai and my elder brother were of the same age. Both were liberal and extravagant. They both loved luxuries and comforts. In their old age, both of them lost interest in worldly pleasures and pursuits. They wrote to me, independently of each other, that they wished to join me in South Africa and spend the rest of their life there and hand over their children to my care. I gladly welcomed their desire and made preparations to receive them. But fate was unkind to me. They left me. I never got my elder brother’s children under my care, though I tried hard to get them. But I got all of you without trying. Shall we attribute this to fate ruling human relations, or to the ripening of the fruit of our deeds in past lives? Now that you have
 
 come, do not leave me. Everybody who wishes may have a share in what I have to give. Secure as much of it as you can and wish good name for yourself in life. Where has that  Chandrahasa hidden  himself?

         DEAR 	FRIEND,           April 	14, 1933 
  	I thank you for your letter. I do not feel as you do about worship 	of God through idols. You should read what I have written about it 	in the columns of the Harijan. Then if you wish to argue, you 	can do so, I have written also about varnashrama. I believe in it as 	I interpret it. For this also I have to refer you to the columns of 	the Harijan.  	As to intermarriage and inter-dining, I do not regard them as 	essential for the removal of untouchability. I regard no person as 	untouchable, but that does not mean that I should be obliged to 	inter-dine with that particular person or have intermarriage 	relations with him. These stand on a different footing altogether. 	We     
 continually pick and choose so far as these two things are concerned, but there is no choice about touching people.

  	I have your postcard. If you have resumed street-cleaning you will, 	I hope, stick to it quite undemonstratively, but I am going to write 	presently on the plague spots of Allahabad, and I would like you to 	read my  articlelibtech_642_footnotewhen 	 it  appears  in  the  Harijan,  and  devote  your attention to that 	work. I shall be quite patient with you so long as you continue to 	work.  	Perhaps you do not know what has happened to N. I feel that I should 	tell you at this stage what impression she left upon me ultimately. 	During my conversations with her I found that she was not leading a 	straight and moral life even whilst she was working at scavenging in 	Bangalore. But she seemed to me to be truly repentant. She has now 	thrown her lot completely with Harijans, has given up the gay life 	entirely and is living as much as possible like a Harijan in a 	Harijan village near Chitaldrug in obscurity and lives on such food 	as is brought to her. She has her son with her. She is supposed to 	be living under my guidance. I have no reason to suspect her. Her 	letters to me are quite satisfactory. But it is too early yet to say 	how she will ultimately develop. I am saying this to you because it 	was agreed between us that at least those who had come in contact 	with her should know generally about the sins of her immediate past.

  	I have a letter from a correspondent in Bulandshahr who says that in 	common with the reduction in the wages of the general staff by its 	Municipal Board, the scavengers also have come in for  the 	reduction.

PHATAKlibtech_643_footnote","
      
 April 14, 1933
 MY DEAR HARIBHAU PHATAK,
 My claim to be a servant of Harijan, of Daridranarayana, has yet to be established, and I freely admit that my food is undoubtedly one of the obstacles to the successful establishment of my claim. But you should know that I do not spend anything on my food. Here it is the costly Government assisted by spendthrift friends who supply me with my food, but the fact that somebody else spends a lot of money over my food is no defence, nor perhaps is it any defence that the goat’s milk and the fruit that I take are a medical need for the body. I know that there are thousands, if not millions, whose bodies too would be pronounced to be in medical need of the kind of food that I am taking. But they have no doctors who would issue such certificates to them, and if they happen to get such a doctor,  neither this Government nor our millionaires would supply them with the food that I receive.
 I am an out-and-out believer in the doctrine of swadeshi, but I flatter myself with the belief that my swadeshi is not a narrow doctrine. I will take from the whole world what I cannot and do not produce in India profitably in terms of the millions. Therefore I do not hesitate to take from Arabia its health-giving dates or from Afghanistan its equally health-giving raisins. These are only a few examples of the foreign articles that I use. But my claim to be a votary of swadeshi is well established because I would take the coarsest hand-spun manufactured by Harijans in preference to the finest cloth manufactured in Indian mills.
 Yes, poor Pyarelal, knowing my weakness for everything Indian, thought that he had found out dates in his paradise, the Punjab, and he did find them. These were expensive enough for those who sent them, but I had to pay nothing for them. I took them whilst they lasted at the expense of Arabia, but the latter won the day, because the Punjab dates were available only during the season which lasts only two or three months. So, on the whole, Arabia will remain the victor with me
 
 
 because I do not propose to deny myself the dates which my body needs and by taking which I deprive no date-grower in India. I cannot give you the name of the agents because Pyarelal could not get the names, for he interested a friend of his in procuring the Punjab dates.
 I am glad that the Poona Municipality has passed Sjt.  Pashankar’s resolution throwing open all public reservoirs to the Harijans.
 Yours sincerely,

MY DEAR RAMACHANDRA,
 I have your letter. I wish you every success in producing an Indian Tuskegee.libtech_644_footnoteI knew much about Booker T. Washington even when I was in South Africa and I have great regard for him. You have kept before you a worthy model, but you cannot be an Indian Booker
 T. Washington. Only a Harijan can be that. Therefore you have to devote yourself, might and main, to the task of producing  from among Harijans a prototype of Booker T. Washington. May you succeed.
 You have established your right to beg, but have you established beyond doubt your fitness for making donations yield a thousandfold fruit? I want you to be foolish enough, if that is the word you would have, to do that.
 Yes, I used the ghee that was specially prepared by Lady Thackersey to the last drop, and you will be glad to know that I was free of salt during the bulk of that time. Some time after I went back to salt and did not call for more ghee when I found that neither the massage nor the saltless produced the slightest impression on the elbows. I went back to salt because I was developing a queer kind of headache. I imputed it, perhaps quite wrongly, to the omission of salt. Curiously enough, the restoration of salt eased the headaches. Whether this was an accident or a result of the return to salt, not perhaps even
 
 15 grains during the day, I do not know.

 Read my letter to Ramji. In his postcard there are sentences such as, “The stomach kicks at the head”, etc., and he  asked  for permission to put everything before Rajbhoj. I have told him that he could do as he wished. I simply cannot understand what has happened to him. Has he lost his reason? From his behaviour  I  do  feel sometimes that he has. He suspects everybody, even his relations.
 You will find with this letters to Dr. Sharma and  Rajbhoj. Discuss with Dr. Sharma the whole problem of constipation. I hope the cracks in the skin on Amina’s thighs have disappeared.
 You certainly cannot pay Manilal’s bills from the Ashram money. Who has provided Rs. 300 to Devdas? I hope he has not been given the sum from the Ashram. The Ashram funds cannot to be used for private purposes.
 What did the doctor tell Kusum? That her motions do not stop is not a good sign. She will continue to be treated by Dr. Talwalkar, but do get her examined by Dr. Sharma also. We should  know  his opinion.

 I feel that you should accept L.’s conditions without any hesitations. After all he is your husband. There is nothing degrading in pacifying his wounded feelings. By doing that you will rise not in your eyes only but in the eyes of God too. Moreover by not disregarding him you will definitely be able to win back his love. In friendship one does not have any right over the other. Husbands and wives are more than friends. That you follow different paths today should not affect your relations. Be calm and everything will be all right. The welfare of the children should be the highest consideration and it will be most looked after if you do not insist on anything. Even after doing this you have to remain satisfied. You want to see the children not for your happiness but for their well-being. Banish from your mind the thought of resorting to law and courts. I hope you understand what I say. Don’t you? May God help and guide you.

 "
456,,NOT MERELY BY BIRTH,"
      
 The following three verses from Madame Wadia’s instructive address delivered the other day will bear reproduction in these pages, though they have been often quoted and published:
 Listen to these words of Yudhishthira in the “Vanaparva” of the
 Mahabharata:
 “Truth, charity, forgiveness, good conduct, gentleness, austerity and mercy, where these are seen, O King of the Serpents, there is a Brahmin. If these marks exist in a Shudra and are not in a Dvija, the Shudra is not a Shudra, nor the Brahmin a Brahmin.”
 And in the Vishnu-Bhagavata we read:
 “What is said as to the marks of conduct indicative of a man’s caste, if those marks are found in another, designate him by the caste of his marks (i.e., not of his body and birth).”
 But some of you would prefer Manusmriti. Well, here you are. “As a wooden elephant, as a leathern deer, such is an unlearned Brahmin; these three bear only names. The Brahmin, who, not having studied the Vedas, labours elsewhere, becomes a Shudra in that very life together with his descendants.”
 These and numerous other verses from the Shastras unm- istakably show that mere birth counts for nothing. A person must show corresponding works and character to establish his claim by birth. Such verses also enforce the argument that
  a 	person loses 	varna by failing 	to exhibit 	its peculiar 	characteristics,  inter-varna 	marriage or 	inter-dining, whatever 	virtue the restrictions 	on them 	may have, does 	not affect a 	person’s varna, at 	least not so much as the failing to live up to one’s varna,  birth, 	while it gives a start and 	enables the 	parents to 	determine the 	training and 	occupation of their 	children, does 	not perpetuate the varna of one’s birth, if it is not fulfilled by works. 
 Harijan, 15-4-1933
 "
457,,SECOND HARIJAN DAY,"
      
 The first Harijan Day was observed on 18th December last. Sjt. Amritlal Thakkar has been most anxious for the fixing of another Harijan Day, but I have been putting it off because of my want of faith. Thakkar Bapa was satisfied with the work done on 18th December. I was not. The fixing of a special day can only be warranted by extraordinary effort. In a sacred cause like the Harijan cause, a special day should be one of greater dedication, prayer and intensive work. Consultation with Thakkar Bapa has infected me with his hope. The last Sunday of this month has been chosen as the day of observance.
I should divide the day somewhat after this style:
  I 	should begin the 	day from 5 	a.m. with prayer and 	set apart for 	the cause some money or 	cloth or 	grain according 	to my means. 	The poorest 	can do 	this by 	denying themselves a 	meal or 	meals or 	a portion 	thereof without feeling the 	slightest deprivation. 	Preferably donations 	in kind 	should be 	converted into 	cash. Where this 	is not 	possible, they 	should be 	given to the most deserving and 	needy Harijans.  The 	work of 	the family 	Bhangi, if there 	is any, 	should be 	wholly done 	by the 	family or at 	least shared with 	him. This 	will enableone 	to understand 	the nature 	of the 	service that the Bhangi 	performs and 	may also lead to 	an improved method of 	performing such 	services. Not many 	persons have 	any consideration 	for the 
 ‘knight of the broom’ at the time of using the sanitary conveniences. If we had no untouchability in us and if we even occasionally shared the work with the Bhangis, we would have a different method of working the home sanitary system.
  Having 	done these 	two things, 	we are 	ready for 	the corporate effort for 	the day, which should 	open with house-to-house 	collection of 	donations in 	cash or 	kind. This 	work should be 	finished by 	a given 	hour. The donations 	should be handed 	to the 	local committee, which 	will in its 	turn hand the collection 	to the 	superior committee 	till it 	reaches the 	headquarters of 	the Province. 	Collectors should take 	with them 	a judicious 	selection of literature 	including leaflets, pamphlets, 	books and even 	copies of Harijan, 	English or 	vernacular edition 	as may 	be required. 	The literature 	should be 	sold or 	given away as 	the exigency 	of the 	moment may 	require. But 	each committee 	should bear 	the cost 	of the 	literature ordered by 	it. If 	extra copies 	of the 	Harijan are 	required, previous 	advice should 	be  given  to  the 	publishers so 	as to enable them to 	print extra copies.  Harijan 	quarters should 	be visited 	in each 	place and 	they should 	be cleaned 	wherever necessary. Meetings of 	Harijans should be 	held and their 	wants noted. They should be 	advised as 	to the part 	they have 	to play in 	the removal of 	untouchability. Dr. 	Deshmukh’s 	authoritative opinion 	should be used 	in support 	of the 	plea for 	the giving 	up of 	carrion-eating. Children 	can arrange 	meetings and 	excursions for 	Harijan children. 	Possibilities of an 	inauguration of 	improved methods of 	sanitation should 	be explored 	and wherever 	possible, the 	scheme of 	Sjt. Hiralal Shah should 	be given 	effect to. It is 	neither difficult nor 	expensive if 	the people 	will shoulder 	the burden 	willingly. In 	the end it 	means a 	visible addition 	to the health 	and wealth 	of the community.  The 	day should be 	wound up 	by a general 	meeting of both 	savarnas and 	Harijans to 	pass resolutions, 	pledging the meeting 	to the 	removal of 	untouchability and 	emphasizing the 	desirability of permissive 	legislation regarding temple-entry.  Where 	public opinion is 	favourable, public wells 	and private temples 	should be opened 	to Harijans. 
 An accurate report of the work done should be sent to the Central Committee and, if possible, a copy to me to avoid delay in publication. Press messages may be sent to the Editor at press rates.
 Harijan, 15-4-1933"
458,,458. THINKING ALOUD,"
 Both C. F. Andrews and I have the habit of thinking aloud. Here is a sample from one of his letters:
 I have enclosed . . . ’slibtech_648_footnoteletter because I hardly think you realize how very strong here is the moral repulsion against ‘fasting unto death’. I confess, as a Christian I share it and it is only with the greatest difficulty that I find myself able to justify it under any circumstances. I was convinced at the time last year when in desperation the way seemed open for nothing else and only this one door seemed unclosed. But even then it was an agony to me. I know also that I must bow to God’s will even when it comes in very strange forms. Also I know that it has had its place in the past in Hindu religion and I have to try to understand exactly what it means to a Hindu. All this I am trying very hard to think out. But it has not come out all clear yet.
 I felt that it would be good to tell you all this at a time when there is no immediate prospect of such a thing happening. Meanwhile, I am trying to think out the whole matter. I have again and again defended over here your last fast and pointed to its results and to the fact that such a tender conscience as Gurudev’s could see in it only what was great and noble. But in the great effort that you yourself are making (and we are interpreting to the very best of our power) to convert the hearts of Englishmen, whom you love and respect, to side with you and not against you in freeing your country, the following is true:
  It 	is easy 	to get 	their sympathy with 	the removal of 	untouchability. Their 	hearts are truly touched.  It 	is not easy 	to get sympathy 	with the idea 	of committing 	suicide by fasting unto 	death. The horror 	and repulsion 	are too great, 	and the mere 	threat of such a thing benumbs instead of awakening the conscience. 
 I know you would love me to tell you all this just now, if I have not told it to you already, because while it is not an immediate issue, I can write calmly.
I publish this letter because it deserves a public reply. I do want
 every ounce of real sympathy from every part of the world in the very difficult and anxious work of the purification of Hinduism, which, as I have claimed, is in a way purification of the whole human family.
 I know the English repulsion to fasting for religious ends and especially ‘fasting unto death’. I should like to own also that even the
 
 fast which Deenabandhu Andrews reconciled himself to, though very reluctantly, has had untoward results in India, as I have discovered to my sorrow. Hindus had become delirious and done acts which, when they became sober, they undid. They opened temples and wells to Harijans freely during the fast. Some of these were closed soon after the end of the fast. A very large number of educated caste Hindus in Bengal do sincerely feel that, in the midst of the excitement caused by the fast, a grave injustice was done to Bengal in the allotment of seats to Harijans. I know, too, that in some other Provinces the Yeravda Pact was assented to under the pressure of the fast. All this was bad. I certainly had not anticipated it all when I embarked on the fast. But I do not repent of it. In the first place, the fast was not of my doing. Secondly, though the respective acts were done under the pressure of the fast, they were not in themselves evil. Were they evil, I should move heaven and earth to undo the evil.
 But my purpose just now is to examine, not the effects of the fast, but the fast itself as a necessary part of the Divine scheme. If it is a part of it, it ought not to need elaborate explanations each time it is undertaken.
 Although the sanatanists swear at me for the fast, and Hindu co-workers may deplore it, they know that fasting is an integral part of even the present-day Hinduism. They cannot long affect to be  horrified at it. Hindu religious literature is replete with instances of fasting, and thousands of Hindus fast even today on the slightest pretext. It is the one thing that does the least harm. There is no doubt that, like everything that is good, fasts are abused. That is inevitable. One cannot forbear to do good because sometimes evil is done under its cover.
 My real difficulty is with my Christian Protestant friends, of whom I have so many and whose friendship I value beyond measure. Let me confess to them that, though from my very first contact with them I have known their dislike for fasts, I have never been able to understand it.
 Mortification of the flesh has been held all the world over as a condition of spiritual progress. There is no prayer without fasting, taking fasting in its widest sense. A complete fast is a complete and literal denial of self. It is the truest prayer. “Take my life and let it be, always only all for Thee” is not, should be, a mere lip or figurative expression. It has to be a wreckless and joyous giving without the least reservation. Abstention from food and even water is but the mere
 beginning, the least part of the surrender.
 Whilst I was putting together my thoughts for this article, a pamphlet written by Christians came into my hands wherein was a chapter on the necessity of example rather than precept. In this occurs a quotation from the 3rd chapter of Jonah. The Prophet had foretold that Nineveh, the great city, was to be destroyed on the fortieth day of his entering it.
 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, ‘Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything: let them not feed, nor drink water: but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn everyone from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?’ And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that He had said that He would do unto them; and He did it not.
Thus this was a ‘fast unto death’. But every fast unto death is
 not suicide. This fast of the king and the people of Nineveh was a great and humble prayer to God for deliverance. It was to be either deliverance or death. Even so was my fast, if I may compare it to the Biblical fast. This chapter from the book of Jonah reads like  an incident in the Ramayana.
 It is only proper that friends should know my fundamental position. I have a profound belief in the method of the fast, both private and public. It may come again any day without any warning even to me. If it comes, I shall welcome it as a great privilege and a joy.
 Untouchability is a big sin. It may not be washed without the blood of many servants. But they will have to be fit instruments. The occasion will come to me if I am found worthy for the sacrifice. I would like my friends to rejoice in it, if it comes. They should neither be repelled nor unnerved.
 Harijan, 15-4-1933
 "
459,,AN IMPATIENT WORKER,"
    
 An earnest but impatient worker has been trying to have temples and public places thrown open to Harijans. He had some success but nothing to be proud of. In his impatience, therefore, he writes:
 It is no use waiting for these orthodox men to make a beginning. They will never move unless compelled to do so. Drastic steps are required to wipe of untouchability. I therefore beg you to kindly favour me with your opinion if satyagraha at the entrance of the temples by workers and Harijans preventing orthodox persons from entering the temples will be an effective method. Appeals and entreaties have produced no effect, and to lose more time on these will, in my humble opinion, be sheer waste of valuable time.
 Such blocking the way will be sheer compulsion. And there should be no compulsion in religion or in matters of any reform. The movement for the removal of untouchability is one of self- purification. No man can be purified against his will. Therefore, there can be no force directly or indirectly used against the orthodox. It should be remembered that many of us were like the orthodox people before our recognition of the necessity of the removal of untouchability. We would not then have liked anybody to block our way to the temples, because we in those days believed, no doubt wrongly as we now think, that Harijans should not be allowed to enter temples. Even so may we not block the way of the orthodox to the temples.
 I should also remind correspondents that the word ‘satyagraha’ is often most loosely used and is made to cover veiled violence. But as the author of the word I may be allowed to say that it excludes every form of violence, direct or indirect, veiled or unveiled, and whether in though, word or deed. It is breach of satyagraha to wish ill to an opponent or to say a harsh word to him or of him with the intention of harming him. And often the evil thought or the evil word may, in terms of satyagraha, be more dangerous than actual violence used in the heat of the moment and perhaps repented and forgotten the next moment. Satyagraha is gentle, it never wounds. It is never fussy, never impatient, never vociferous. It is the direct opposite of compulsion. It was conceived as a complete substitute for violence.
 Nevertheless, I fully agree with the correspondent that ‘most drastic steps are required to wipe off untouchability’. But these steps have to be taken against ourselves. The orthodox people sincerely believe that untouchability, as they practise it, is enjoined by the
 Shastras and that great evil will befall them and Hinduism if it was removed. How is one to cope with this belief ? It is clear that they will never change their belief by being compelled to admit Harijans to their temples. What is required is not so much the entry of Harijans to the temples as the conversion of the orthodox to the belief that it is wrong to prevent Harijans from entering the temples. This conversion can only be brought about by an appeal to their hearts,  i.e.,  by evoking the best that is in them. Such an appeal can be made by the appellants’ prayers, fasting other suffering in their own persons, in other words, by their ever-increasing purity. It has never yet been known to fail. For it is its own end. The reformer must have consciousness of the truth of his cause. He will not then be impatient with the opponent, he will be impatient with himself. He must be prepared even to fast unto death. Not everyone has the right or the capacity to do so. God is most exacting. He exacts humility from His votaries. Even fasts may take the form of coercion. But there is nothing in the world that in human hands does not lend itself to abuse. The human being is a mixture of good and evil, Jekyll and Hyde. But there is the least likelihood of abuse when it is a matter of self-suffering.

 DEAR FRIEND,"
461,"April 15, 1933",LETTER TO V. S. R. SASTRI,"
    
 
 April 15, 1933
  	I went through your letter very carefully as soon as I got it. You 	should accept my assurance that I want to be convinced. I have no 	axe to grind on this earth except to find Truth. You insist upon 	your own interpretation, or call it the orthodox interpretation, and 	you swear by it. That is quite natural. Others whose learning I do 	not doubt for one moment swear by their own interpretation. You are 	doing them an injustice when you say that they do so to please me. I 	can only tell you what I do know and what I alone can know, and that 	is this: They are independent men. They are scholars known to fame. 	They have a character to keep. And many of them were accepted as 	authority on Shastras before I returned to India from my long exile. 	It is between these two interpretations that I have to make my 	choice, guided by such knowledge as I have of the Shastras, both in 	the original and in translations.  	You suggest a meeting of the Pandits representing different schools 	of thought. Perhaps you do not know that I had such a meeting. I 	listened to their arguments with the greatest patience and with the 	utmost respect. I approached my task without any bias. I resist 	untouchability because I regard it as a great lie. If somebody 	convinced me that it was a great truth, I would repent of my folly 	and swear by untouchability. Beyond this I cannot argue.  	But before closing I must answer one pointed question that you have 	put to me. It is only in God that everything melts into one and 	there is neither virtue nor vice, neither good nor evil, neither sin 	nor merit, neither happiness nor unhappiness, and if you will, 	neither truth nor untruth. That is indefinable. But so long as I am 	in a body I must continue to experience the duality. The 	obliteration of duality can only exist in my imagination as an 	intellectual grasp. And if any person were to put forth an opposite 	claim, I should have no right to question his claim, and I would 	gladly admit the inferiority of my position. The inferiority would 	not worry me because it would be in accordance with the Truth as I 	see it.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 20948

 April 15, 1933
  	I have to answer two letters of yours. I had intended to reply to 	your previous letter, but somehow failed to do so.  	I have heard that Pragji has landed in Bombay. But there is no news 	from him yet.  	You have written to Narandas asking him to pay the bills for the 	press equipment, but how can it be done?libtech_650_footnotelibtech_651_footnoteIt 	is altogether improper to use Trust funds in such a manner. It would 	be another thing if Narandas could make some private arrangement. 	You should have such dealings with the traders directly, or order 	the goods through traders there or remit the money in advance. I 	understand your difficulty, but you ought not to adopt an improper 	course to solve it. Otherwise you will come to grief some day. One 	should stretch one’s legs according to the covering. It is better 	to draw in our knees, rather than borrow a covering from somebody 	else. I 	hope all of you have emerged safe from the epidemic of fever there. Do 	Pathar and others who come there for change of air meet  	their own expenses or does the burden fall on you? If it falls on 	you and if you can shoulder it, of course nothing like it. But if 	you cannot shoulder it, you should humbly tell them that everybody 	will have to meet his own expenses. Please know that it is against 	dharma to do anything beyond one’s means out of a false sense of 	prestige. We should let ourselves be seen as we are.  	I don’t like at  all  your  request  to  be  allowed  to  shift  	the press to a city. That will mean that all my ideals are wrong, or 	that you do not believe in them or cannot live up to them. If any of 	these alternatives is correct, you should not remain a trustee and 	should leave Phoenix. You seem even to have forgotten how quickly 	and with what difficulties I turned my back on city life and  	established  Phoenix. You grew up in Phoenix. It was there you 	atoned for your errors, lived an independent life. Sita was born 	there too. That you should forget all this in a moment and think of 	leaving Phoenix for ever—imagine the weakness and the pitiable 	condition of mind it    
 reveals.
 I supported you in one wrong step that you took and invited West’s criticism. That criticism was deserved to some extent. This error was about the insertion of advertisements. I did not like your action, but I did not have the courage to tell you that you could close down Indian Opinion if you wished. I don’t want you to fall further and drag me down with you. I will not let myself be dragged down. If you cannot settle in Phoenix with single-minded devotion and cannot live up to its ideals you should wind up the work. Or you and Sushila should dedicate yourselves exclusively to Phoenix. Instead of being forced to close down the settlement, I should like you to give your resignation to the Trustees and hand over the place to them and then do what you like. I will welcome your leaving Phoenix with your reputation unsullied. I shall not be pained if you do so. But I shall feel deeply pained if you are forced to leave the place in disgrace. Please remember that only recently you borrowed Rs. 10,000 from a public body here and took the money with you. Forget the past completely. Wake up from your slumber. Don’t think that I say all this merely in reply to one suggestion by you and feel hurt. That suggestion reveals your attitude of mind. It is a dangerous one and that is why I caution you against it.
 There is Miss Schlesin entertaining beautiful dreams about you, and you are thinking of filthy Durban. You must have sufficient pride in you to be determined that, if you cannot bring glory to your father’s legacy, you will at any rate not disgrace it. Do you know the objects of Phoenix, or have you forgotten them as well? Read them again.
 Miss Schlesin’s suggestion is certainly admirable. But I don’t think you will be able to act upon it. Kallenbach will not agree to meet the expenses of a visit to America, and you will not be able to get the money from any other source. And I also think it difficult, if not impossible, that I. O. can be kept up meanwhile. Even if you go to America and return after getting trained, I don’t think patients from all communities will come to Phoenix for nature-cure treatment. All the same, if you have self-confidence and if everything can be arranged, I would certainly like you to act upon the suggestion, for the aim behind it is noble.
 I hope Sita has completely recovered now. Take the utmost care of your health.
Read this letter three or four times and then decide your future
 course. Think over the following questions:
 What 	is the 	aim in life 	of you both?  Do 	you wish 	to live 	up to the 	ideals of 	Phoenix? Do 	you have 	the necessary 	strength for it? Can 	I. O. 	be made self-supporting? 
 You may take one thing as certain: We don’t wish to run Phoenix while abandoning its ideals, and I. O. must not be shifted to any other place.
 Please don’t take this letter as a rebuke to you, I have written to wake up both of you. Indecision is a very bad thing.
 We are quite well. The letter has become too long and I have no time either. So I cannot give any news about things here.

 CHI. SUSHILA,
 Since the letterlibtech_652_footnoteto Manilal is intended for you both, what more can I write in this letter?
 You may teach Sita only as much as you can while playing with her and without scolding or beating her. She will imbibe very little from what both of you tell her, but she will certainly follow the example which you set.
 Ramdas has not been released yet. He will be released in the beginning of May.
 The only change in my diet is that I do not at present take bread and vegetables. Fruit and milk suffice for me. I do not heat the milk. The pain in the elbow persists, but it seems to be only a sign of old age.

April 15, 1933
 You 	seem to have decided to write by turns.  	How can a Gujarati who does not know about Narmadashankarlibtech_653_footnotebe called a Gujarati? It was as early as in my 	childhood that I first came to know about him. I am never tired of 	singing his poem: “The bugles blow: Let us all go to battle and 	victory.” The fascination which began then deepened in South 	Africa. I had by then become a devoted lover of the Gita. 	Narmadashankar’s preface to his translation of the Gita 	deepened my love for it and increased my respect for him. My 	only regret is that my numerous activities did not permit me to 	acquire as much knowledge of a writer and poet like Narmadashankar 	as I should have liked to do.  	I hope you don’t expect from me more than this just now. Even this 	little I have been able to write to you because I got up at 3 	o’clock in the morning.  	To dedicate one’s life to the service of Harijans is indeed 	difficult; it is still more difficult to become fit to die for them. 	How demanding is Satyanarayanalibtech_654_footnote! How finicky He is.  He  would  have spotlessly pure 	sheep, the very best pumpkin, the heads of sinless men, and how are 	we to get them for Him? For, He would reject one for a single impure 	thought that might cross one’s mind ! ! Still it is impossible to 	leave Him. So jealous is that Poet of poets that He simply would not 	let me worship any other poet. To whom may I complain about this?  	I assume that your pain has completely disappeared. I hope Jagadish 	is improving.  	Now  about  the  Kabibai  Trust.libtech_655_footnotelibtech_656_footnoteI 	 have  gone  through  all  the papers relating to it. My reading of 	it is that there can be no objection to taking in Harijans if room 	is left after the so-called “high class” Hindus have been fully 	provided for. The Trust does not exclude Harijans. However, if all 	you lawyers so interpret the terms that Harijans should have no 	place at all even if pupils from “high-class” Hindus do not seek 	admission to the school in sufficient number and      
 some benches or seats are left vacant, I have nothing to say.
 The next issue is a purely educational question. On what type of education is the Trust money to be spent? This is not a subject which can be discussed through letters. I have not been able to convince many people of the correctness of my views on education. On the one hand I want selfless teachers of the type dreamt of by Gokhale and, on the other, a system of education from which the dying villagers can derive benefit. This country cannot afford to imitate any  other country, and so we have got to think independently about our educational problem and devise a plan of our own. However for the present all this is only a fond dream of mine. And you also have no time just now to think about this subject.
 I am progressing in your books only at a snail’s pace. But I have kept up my reading. Have you seen the tiny cart driven by the tiny Ahmedabad bullock? The speed of that bullock would put the Aga Khan’s race horse to shame, and it is at that speed that Sardar has been reading your books. Let me admit that we have a motive behind all this, as we wish to take plenty of services from both of you. Shouldn’t we fully know those from whom we expect so much?
 You can know from this that we often think and talk about you.

 "
466,,TWO SAMPLES,"
    
 Shri Chhotalal Pandit, representative of the Harijan Sevak Sangh of Kadi area, writes:libtech_660_footnote
 There is also another letter of this type. Its writer is a public worker but is not at present connected with Harijan work. I give the following extract from his letter:libtech_661_footnote
 These two are but samples of the letters I receive from British Gujarat. I get accounts of similar experiences from Kathiawar too. After returning from her tour of Kathiawar, Smt. Vijayalakshmibehnlibtech_662_footnotecalled on me and gave me an account of her experiences. These too had the dark side in good measure. She could do some work because of her ability. But there was no end of difficulties. Nobody, therefore, should believe that the foregoing letters are  exceptions. Gujaratis alone will read the Harijanbandhu, hence, apart from a handful of Gujaratis outside Gujarat, the rest of the country will believe that the description given in the two letters is mild compared to the true position.
 Nevertheless, I refuse to believe that these pictures are without a silver-lining. God never created a cloud without a silver-lining. Darkness only means absence of life. In a vast, clear, diamond- studded sky, the clouds are no bigger than an atom as it were. And yet these clouds almost spell death to creatures extremely smaller than themselves living below on the earth. This is the condition of Harijan work at present. It seems that the clouds of their bitter experiences fill Harijan workers with despair. But says Narasinh Mehta:
 When the gods were in trouble,
 They remembered Him who dwells in us all, Shri Krishna came to their rescue,
 The second correspondent had said that despite all the efforts of Gandhiji and the Servants of Untouchables Society, little progress was made in the removal of untouchability.
 Narasinh Mehta’s Lord.
 This also is a statment of experience. All who read this bhajan can see that the poet did not write this simply to make a good song, but that he could not help singing the truth which he wished to  describe. Moreover, such experience was not Narasinh’s alone. It has been the experience of all the world’s saints. That is why one of the descriptions of God is Bhidabhanjanlibtech_663_footnotelibtech_664_footnote. This is a fight for dharma. We have staked our very lives on it. Hence the first thing I want to say is that workers should not lose heart but rest confident that at the critical moment God will definitely help them.
 But this faith should not be weak or ignorant. Out of it must spring tremendous energy. Where a thinking man’s reason is paralysed, he who has faith can see the path through it. Where others’ eyes see nothing, the eyes of faith see as clearly as in daylight. Such a person never admits defeat, and even his resting will be for strength. It will be a sign that he will resume work with much greater energy than before. His fast will not be an expression of despair, but a sacred means of being able to live more fruitfully.
 Hence my request to all men and women workers is this: Do not get angry with sanatanists and do not goad frightened Harijans. Fire-fighters do not direct water at a house which they think cannot be saved but they direct it at neighbouring buildings within the range of the flames so as to prevent the fire from spreading and thus to check its fury. It cannot live on without food from the neighbourhood, and so as soon as the area around is rendered safe, the fire dies out by itself. Similarly where the Harijans have some strength at least and are ready to accept direct help they should be given such help.  One should not work where they are not so ready, but should work in nearby areas where the Harijans are more or less ready. The work done among them cannot but have effect in the other place where the Harijans seem to have no life in them.
 Even in that place, however, one should certainly try to plead with the sanatanists. There will hardly be a single village which will not have even one person who loves Harijans. One can establish contact with that village through him.
 Let us take the case of the school mentioned above. That the Harijan children left it, does not worry me. It was necessary that they
 
 
 should have joined it. If their parents are willing to  entrust  the children to us, we should take charge of them and educate them elsewhere. If the teacher is courageous, he should face boycott, if beaten he should put up with the beating, and bring back the Harijan children at the first opportunity. He should reason with the sanatanists. If the teacher has regard for his dharma, he should lay down his life for the sake of those three children who were under his charge. But supposing the teacher does not have so much spirit, then Shri Chhotalal should keep this village in mind and seek opportunities of once again establishing good relations with its sanatanists or Harijans or both. Those opportunities should be sought through service of both. He should seek out their friends and make use of those who carry weight with the respective parties, to awaken the sense of justice of one and removing the fear of the other. In short, while serving in other places, he should not forget either those three children or that village. He should make it his chief aim to protect the former.
 Two points emerge from these letters. We have very few men and women workers who are sincere, single-minded and ready even to lay down their lives. A person who has dedicated himself to one task may be said to have dedicated himself to all. He  who  addressee himself to all tasks is not dedicated even to one. His condition is like that of a man living with a woman without marrying her. We have not properly understood this great truth. If we understand it, much of our work would become easy. Without dedicated workers who are ready to sacrifice their all for the cause of Harijans the blot of untouchability cannot be removed.
 The second point is this. I must do what I ask others to do. That is in my nature. I started serving the country by serving Gujarat. I make no distinction among Gujarat, India, and the world. I live my life on the principle that by paying single-minded attention to one we pay attention to all. Non-violent work cannot be opposed to public good. That is the point of view from which this yajna of removal of untouchability is being carried on. When I recount the errors of the sanatanists, they are mine too. I do not regard myself as separate from them. I am impatient to do atonement, but impatience will not help. If  I have in me the required purity for such atonement, God  will  certainly command me to undertake it. I daily pray to God to grant me such purity and the strength to obey His command.

467,"April 16, 1933",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
    
 April 16, 1933
 CHI. NARANDAS,
I got your letter.
 Send Ramabehn to Baroda to be examined by Manekrao. If he undertakes to treat her, let him. If Manekrao does not know what to do in her case, she should come to Poona. There is a vaid here who is  a specialist about diseases affecting bones. I will get Ramabehn examined by him and do whatever is necessary. Even  ordinary medical help will be available here. If ultimately an operation is found necessary, I will consider whether it should be performed in Ahmedabad or at some other place. It will be better if the children remain there. If they cannot, they may accompany her. Najuklallibtech_665_footnotelibtech_666_footnoteand others are there in Baroda and I believe that they will look after them.  I don’t know what facilities he has in his house. She will be able to stay even at Abbas Saheb’s house. The place is not full just now. I don’t know whether Deshpande Saheb’s house has sufficient accommodation. Ramabehn should go to Baroda after you  have written to Manekrao and received his reply. If he is not in Baroda or if he is not ready to undertake the case, she may come to Poona. Here in Poona Prof. Trivedi’s house is open to every visitor. Don’t mind if our debt to him goes on mounting. He likes to be troubled. His house does not seem to be full just now.
 My opinion is definitely in favour of giving the machine to Keshu. I haven’t thought about how much he should be charged. You and Keshu alone can know that. I think that breakages and other charges also should be debited.
 Madhavji’s letter is excellent. He, too, has written to Calcutta and asked them to send the children to the Ashram.
 I follow what you say regarding Jeki’s sons. I have got the impression that they are well-behaved.
 And now your problem. Our ideal is Rama. There were people who criticized him too. How, then, can you or I hope to be spared? We should learn from the criticism. Chhaganlal’s criticism and suggestions are enclosed with this. Most of the suggestions are old. If you think Premabehn will be able to read without being upset what he has written about her, let her read it.
 
 
 I think that his suggestion about . . .libtech_667_footnotelibtech_668_footnoteis improper. Nobody can tell a father how he should treat his daughter. I have sent Chhaganlal’s criticism as it is without making any corrections because I thought it would be better for you to know what is in his mind. There are other things which seem to me to need correction but the letter would  become too long if I did so. I did not know Chhaganlal outside jail as closely as I have come to know him here. I am sure that he is a man of transparent sincerity and tries to cultivate the spirit of renunciation, but he is a child. His intellect is not well developed. His power of observation is very imperfect, he does not possess a methodical mind, his memory, too, is weak, and his mind wanders after too many things so that his capacity for concentration is limited. And he is not aware of all these limitations of his. All the same, he is very eager to improve himself and to grow. He has no ill-will against anybody, but because of an imperfectly developed intellect his conclusions are one-sided and erroneous. I don’t think this analysis is mine only, though I have not discussed these impressions with anybody, except a little with Kaka. I have not told Chhaganlal what I think about him. He will know that for the first time from this letter. It became necessary to say it today because I don’t want you to form a wrong opinion about him. You may detect ill will in his remarks. But if you can you may trust that my observation of him is correct. If you do so, you will be able to see something in his criticism and suggestions which is worth accepting. In any case do give me your replies to his criticisms and suggestions. If you wish to show them to other co-workers, I will not object, though I don’t see any need for that.
 You are working as a secretary because I believe that  you possess many of the virtues, and possess them in good measure, which you would like to have. I am not in the least dissatisfied with your work. My opinion about you remains unchanged, and I would be surprised if others have not formed the same impression that I have.
 N. says in his letter that he has not. Chhaganlal thinks that others, too, have not. But nobody has complained to me.
 However, as I write this, I think of Bhagwanji. His complaint had produced no effect on me. I know his nature very well. But we should listen to persons on whom we have produced an unfavourable impression. We may find it easy to secure the co-operation of those who think well of us, but we learn nothing from them. Only our critics
 serve us as sentinels. You may, therefore, learn as much from N. as you wish to.
 If you think it proper, you may show . . . ’slibtech_669_footnotelibtech_670_footnoteand  .  .  .  ’slibtech_671_footnotelibtech_672_footnoteletters to Totaramji, Panditji, Narahari, Lakshmidas and Mathuradas, and hear them if they have anything to say. If Totaramji and Panditji offer to take charge, hand it over to them and, if they wish, work under them and look after the accounts. I look upon Totaramji  as  the  fittest person to be regarded as father of the Ashram. We need somebody as  a father. We regard the Ashram as a family. If I stayed there, I would consider myself as father of the Ashram. Even if Totaramji does not accept that place, I would not think it improper at all to treat him as one and unhesitatingly follow his advice whenever a difficult problem arises. Lakshmidas possesses all the virtues necessary in a secretary of the Ashram, but I do not know whether at present he can live there. Narahari certainly cannot do so, since he is not free, so far as I know. Chimanlal’s health is much too poor for the task. Mathuradas has still to acquire experience. These are my views about all the co-workers whom I can think of. Vinoba cannot be shifted from Wardha. His responsibility is confined to Wardha. In fact he has left even Wardha and lives in a hamlet of Harijans.libtech_673_footnotelibtech_674_footnoteHe had my full consent for doing that. He may ultimately go and live in a hamlet still more exclusively inhabited by Harijans. You must, therefore, carry on as you are.
 I have written all this merely for you to think over. In entrusting the welfare of the Ashram to your care when leaving it, I did not offer you a place of authority but burdened you with responsibility, and the position is still the same. I have observed nothing to persuade me to take away the responsibility from you. Nor can you give it up. You should, therefore, implement only those suggestions of mine which you find acceptable, having due regard to your  responsibility.  I cannot express any definite opinion from here. Whatever happens to the Ashram, good or ill, you will be the means. We should be thankful that I am permitted to write to you. If I was not permitted, wouldn’t you act according to your own judgment? Therefore always do what seems best to you, regarding my letters and views as of no consequence. My duty is over when I have put before you what I hear and think. I want you to remain unaffected in the midst of all this, in
 
 the sense explained in the Gita.
 Let this period not be one of worries for you, though it is certainly a time of test for equanimity. See that you never lose it.

 I would be glad if you would all write to me your opinions on these things . There is no harm if I have already written this before . It is good to have the memory of such things kept fresh.

         April 	16, 1933  CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	I dispatched a letter to you this morning. I have heard from Gaur 	Gopal. As he got my letter late, he has decided to go to Puri. I 	have written to him again and asked him to go to Almora.  	I have had no letter at all from Prabhudas. Hasn’t he written to 	you also? Where is he at present?  	Mahadev tells me that Poore’s book is in Maganlal’s collection. 	I suppose you know that all those books belong to the Ashram. If you 	find Poore’s book among them, send it to me. The book was also 	included in the list sent by Purushottam.  	If Purushottam has not left for Rajkot and if he can stay on, ask 	him to do so. Jamna’s treatment is not over and Amina also may 	need his advice. But you will be better able to decide about this.  	Though I did write to you this morning and sent you Chhaganlal’s 	criticism, I did all that with some hesitation. I felt that your, 	Chhaganlal’s, mine and the Ashram’s good required that. I 	thought it desirable that you should know even Chhaganlal’s views 	in their naked truth, and also that you should know my view of how 	his intellect works. The verse in the Ishopanishad which 	tells us that the face of Truth is hidden by a-golden lid echoes in 	my ears all the time. I feel its truth every moment of my life. We 	must open that lid. Anyone who can bear that being done will be 	affected by little else. What anyone believes about us is absolute 	truth to him. We must  have the strength to understand it and face 	it. This is a form of non-violence.  BAPU  From 	a microfilm of the Gujarati: M.M.U./I. Also C.W. 8357. Courtesy: 	Narandas Gandhi

 like you are borne by the Ashram, whether they come  to  eleven rupees or twenty-one rupees. You are, therefore, not concerned with the figure of eleven. It only reminds us that it is our aim not to exceed it. If you need more ghee or anything else and do not get it, you would certainly be justified in complaining about that. I would, however, request you not to keep back anything but complain frankly to anybody whom you regard as a friend . You will have to deal with Narandas till the end of your life.

The problem you have raised is not new, and 	because we are surrounded by death and destruction on all sides we 	have the positive word “himsa”, and yet every religion 	that is known to mankind insists upon life as the law, but conduct 	prescribed has been designated by a negative word, that is, “ahimsa” 	or non-violence. That can only exist for a bodied life as an ideal 	to be reached, not to be realized in action in  physical  existence. 	 Nevertheless if we recognize the law of ahimsa we would always 	shape our conduct so as to approach it as near as possible and 	therefore we would resort to as little violence as it is humanly 	possible, whereas if himsa was the law of our being, we would 	naturally do as much destruction as we could and rejoice in it. But 	we do not find many people rejoicing in doing violence, whereas we 	do find many people apologizing for what violence they did. To say 	that there is double law    
 working, namely, violence and non-violence, would be to argue that two contrary laws can co-exist. This is hardly the right thing.

MY DEAR C. R.,
 I have your letter after long waiting. Of course I saw what Natarajan had written. Have not seen what Kodanda Rao has written. I do not know that anything can be done beyond writing to these  friends. I often do with more or less success. I commend  the prescription to you. Try it with Natarajan to commence with. He is slow to perceive flaws in his argument, but he is always open to conviction. I therefore never regard him as hopeless.
 Jamnalalji will be going to a hill-station for his own treatment. I do not know whom he will be taking with him. In his latest letter he was thinking of going to Almora.
 I   would   advise   you   to   send   Narasinhamlibtech_680_footnoteand   Papalibtech_681_footnoteby themselves to a quiet place so that they would be sure of perfect rest, that is to say, if Narasinham is able to take care of himself and Papa.

483,"April 	18, 1933",LETTER TO MOTILAL ROY,"
          DEAR 	MOTIBABU,          April 	18, 1933 
  	I have your letter and I am glad you have written to me so 	exhaustively.  	In thinking of temple-entry, we must not think of what the Harijans 	want, but what is due by us to them and what was promised so 	solemnly   at   the   Bombay   meetinglibtech_698_footnotelibtech_699_footnoteunder 	  the   Presidentship   of Malaviyaji. Temple-entry was there 	promised and that promise has to be fulfilled at the sacrifice of 	life itself. Remember the words of the Mahabharata, “Truth 	in one scale and all the other sacrifices in the opposite scale: the 	scale holding Truth will outweigh the other scale.” Breach of 	promise to the Harijans and to God is unthinkable. We may be as 	patient as possible with the sanatanists, but those who have any 	regard for that solemn promise must ceaseless]y pursue temple-entry. 	I do not therefore need to examine the other part of your argument 	about temple-entry. Of course education has to be an active 	programme. Education in the widest sense of the term is wanted, not 	merely for the Harijans but also for the savarna Hindus. What 	we are today suffering from is not so much the want of education as 	too much of mis-education. Irreligion and hypocrisy has been taught 	us in the place of religion and honesty, superstition in the place 	of true knowledge, intolerance in the place of charity, incontinence 	in the place of chastity, distortion of the Shastras in the place of 	a true and simple interpretation thereof woven round the central 	truth.  	I note what you say about the activities of the Sangh, and I hope 	that your efforts will be crowned with full success. If you will 	keep the central fact of hand-spinning intact, you will not yield to 	the temptation of taking the fine yarn from the indigenous mills. I 	do not know whether you have traced the history of Harijans being 	driven from weaving to scavenging simply because the natural cord 	between hand-spun and hand-woven has been broken. If you will have 	fine cloth, you should teach the men and women how to spin fine 	yarn. Out of good slivers I spin 70 counts. Mahadev has gone as much 	as 110 counts. This is finer than the finest spun by any mill in 	India, and    
 you will be surprised to learn that a Harijan weaver at the Ashram has woven Mahadev’s 40 counts. Finer than 40 we began to spin only during this incarceration, but I have no doubt that when our stock of fine yarn can be given for spinning, the same weaver will be able to handle it. We must face the difficulty, cost what it may, in this movement of regeneration.
 Much as I would like to discuss the question of my coming out for the sake of the Harijan cause, prison restrictions would not admit of any such discussion.
 I did not know that Arun had purposely sent the Message and Mission of the Prabartak Sangh for my opinion. I must now look it up if I can lay my hands on it and read it critically.
 I think that your medical adviser is quite right. Your eyes need rest.libtech_700_footnotelibtech_701_footnoteWith all the devoted workers that surround you, why should you use your eyes at all ? I do not know whether you know that there is in vogue a new and strikingly convincing method of treating the eyesight. It is called Bates’s method, and there is a physician in India who knows this method. His name and address are: Dr. Agrawal [Ram Eye Hospital, Bulandshahr].
 I do not know the gentleman at all. He corresponded with me and brought this method first to my notice. Since then American friends have written to me and sent literature also.libtech_702_footnoteIf you at all feel like it, you should correspond with Dr. Agrawal.

MY DEAR SANKARANARAYANA,
 You will please forgive me for not attending to your pamphlet before this. I was helpless. As soon as I had a few moments to spare I took up your pamphlet.
 You have asked me to offer remarks, suggestions, guidance and to give you my blessings. Blessings you have if you deserve them. Whether you do or not I cannot judge, because I have no personal knowledge of your activity. But I can certainly see your earnestness in your report.libtech_708_footnote
 I have gone through all the passages that you have specially marked. It is difficult for me to offer useful criticism.
 Your hit at the turmoil of the temple-entry movement and at the great national leaders betrays somewhere irritation, impatience and ignorance of facts. If you had simply said that the Harijans that have come under your notice do not care for temple-entry, that would have been quite a fair statement to make; but to belittle a great religious movement without even studying it was not right. Just see what it is. In September last, representative Hindus in a public meeting entered into a solemn pledge that among other things temples should be thrown open to Harijans. From that moment it became their duty to strain every nerve to secure the opening of Hindu temples to Harijans. It is irrelevant whether Harijans want to make use of these temples or not, just as it would be irrelevant to the question of opening public schools, public wells and giving them all the other rights hitherto denied to them whether they want or do not want these rights. It is the simple duty of the suppressors to remove the weight of suppression from the heads of the suppressed. The suppressed may have become so stunted that in spite of the lifting of the weight they might not even appreciate the fact that it was lifted. But that would be no excuse for the suppressors to continue the suppression.
 If you admit the justice of the argument you should have no hesitation in owning your mistake. More than this I think I need not say. Every little thing done for the sake of Harijans cannot but be welcome to me, and I think that the field of service is so vast that
 
 
 workers can well afford to do that service without criticizing or belittling the efforts of others except of course where the other effort is mischievous, immoral or selfish.
 In the 6th paragraph of your letter you tell me that you wrote to the local Seva Sangh offering your co-operation and service but that you had received no reply. I have now writtenlibtech_709_footnoteto them.

 THE SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT HOME DEPARTMENT
 BOMBAY
 
 DEAR SIR,
 The enclosed cablelibtech_711_footnotewas sent by me on the 13th instant to the Superintendent for despatch. On the 17th I learnt on inquiry that it was sent to the Inspector-General. On the same day I complained to the Superintendent about the delay in sending the message. I have now at 2.20 p.m. 19th instant learnt that orders have been received that “there is no objection to the despatch of the cable”.
 Happily Sjt. V. J. Patel seems to be in no immediate danger. I have no desire to send the cable now as it is. Nor have I got the patient’s address in Vienna where he has been sent for treatment. I am inquiring about the address.libtech_712_footnote
 But I cannot help protesting against the delay in a matter involving the life of a human being, this time not a prisoner. One matter of delay in the case of a prisoner whose life is in danger is pending before Government.
 Cables such as the one to Sjt. V. J. Patel, the Government will admit, are of use only if they are sent in time. I have known such cables to have given great consolation to their receivers. I cannot allow myself to think that in such a matter the Government have no regard for the feelings of persons in their custody. Was it necessary to detain
 
 
 the cable for seven days? I should like to have my position defined. If  I have the liberty to send such cables, the  Government should empower the authority in immediate custody to handle them.  I  venture to suggest that the present procedure is unfair and  unnecessary. I need hardly point out that the cable was meant to be as well from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the patient’s brother, as from me.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

 DEAR DR. SHARMA,
 I like your letter very much.libtech_713_footnoteIt does you great credit. You have pictured to me the ideal physician. Yes, by all means wash Amtussalaam’s clothes, if necessary. Though in the Ashram, she is solely under your care. Do please insist on taking proper rest and the prescribed diet.
 I would like you critically to examine everything in the Ashram and give me your impressions. Study the health of every inmate who will let you examine him or her. Of course you will frankly tell me of cases that may be beyond your skill. I would like you to examine Kusumbehn. She is today under Dr. Talwalkar’s treatment. But I would like you to tell [me] what you would have her to do, if she puts herself under you. Then there is Jamnabehn. She is a chronic asthmatic. She can be treated by you now if she will put herself under your care. Then there is Ramabehn. She has an enlarged shoulder-bone. I do not yet visualize her trouble. Possibly her case is beyond your province. If it is not, please tell me what you would have her do. Lastly, there is Anandi who has just had an operation for appendicitis. She is having my treatment only, as the others do more or less. These are the special cases I would like you to see as soon as you can and tell me all about them. There are others, too, who require attention.
Now about yourself. While I would like you to throw yourself
 
 into the Ashram routine, you must not go beyond your strength and [you] will take everything easy. Have your special needs supplied. I would feel deeply hurt if, for want of care, your own health was endangered. You will make me feel at ease, if you will treat  the Ashram as your home and express your needs.
 I would like you to accompany Bhagwanji once and see Harijan quarters and examine the ailing ones there and their sanitation.
 I wish your children had both accompanied you. But that now later, if all goes well.
 Yours,
 BAPU

  	I have your letter. One does not have to worry about a person who, 	though her weight be 69 lb., can joke.  	Yes, I remember very well the letters concerning enema, etc. I have 	an impression that I had replied to the questions in a letter to 	Purushottam. But it is also likely that I forgot to do so.  	You can eat tomatoes, . . . libtech_714_footnote, salt and papaw. But according to the system followed 	in the institution where Purushottam learnt  the science, nothing 	but unboiled milk is permitted. Besides, you have to take bed-rest. 	However, Dr. Sharma is there now. Get yourself examined by him, and 	follow his advice if it is fully compatible with what you are doing 	now. I am writing to him. I don’t know him personally. I have 	known him only through correspondence. He does seem to have had 	experience in his field. Now that Purushottam, who was your vaid, 	has left, I will write to you more regularly.

  	I have your letter. I have already written to you and explained what 	to do regarding the arm. The arrival of Dr. Sharma makes no 	difference to my advice. If he can understand the real nature of the 	trouble and is ready to treat it, by all means let him try. 	Otherwise you should adhere to the line I have suggested. You should 	do no work which causes pain to the arm. You may give it only such 	exercise as will cause no pain. But now there will be no need for me 	to give any advice. He, to whose care you must leave the arm, will 	put everything right.  	Amina seems to be in a bad plight. Give her courage and sustain her 	faith. If she is not careful about food, she will again harm her 	health.

  	Why did you beat that girl? A teacher does not lose her self-respect 	by apologizing to her pupil. On the contrary, it  is enhanced. The 	pupils also will love her better. If, therefore, you have not 	already apologized and if you think that it was wrong on your part 	to have beaten her, you should apologize to her. You may be sure 	that will be for your good.  	Your diet is all right. If you continue it your throat is bound to 	improve. Consult Dr. Sharma. If he can think of anything, he will 	suggest it. Why 	do you get impatient in your work? If you are content 
 with what you can do slowly, the work will be faster and the result will be neater. I have had this experience thousands of times.

 April 19, 1933
 CHI. NARANDAS,
I got your big packet. It is really big this time.
 Nobody should copy my bad habits. I can even give reasons to excuse them. All the same everybody should know that they are bad habits and avoid them.
  Nobody 	should read a 	book or 	a newspaper 	while eating. The best 	thing is to have 	in one 	serving as 	much as 	one wants 	and to 	eat the 	meal in 	complete silence. If 	one cannot 	do this, 	one may talk 	to one’s 	neighbour in whispers. 	It is a bad habit 	to do 	two things 	simultaneously.  Nobody 	should do any 	other work while 	spinning, should 	neither dictate letters 	nor teach 	as I do. It 	is a bad habit 	to read 	in the lavatory.  It 	is unbearable to 	clean the 	teeth in 	the lavatory. 	The habit 	is unhygienic and dirty. I have never been guilty of this bad habit. 
 But I do the first three things. However, a person’s bad habits should not be copied. I never defend these habits as good. Moreover, I live in complete privacy. I have a separate room for lavatory and can keep books in that room. I may die any time, and cannot overcome the temptation to do as much work as I can while I live. I am not eager to overcome it either. I have these and many other reasons or excuses. But nobody else should use them to defend his bad habits. Show this to all the inmates. All these habits are also responsible for constipation and other troubles. We attach great importance to bodily labour and work in the Ashram. But there should be no impatience or excessive eagerness in doing even these. Whenever anybody feels that his work is too heavy, he should reduce it. Nobody is required to work beyond his capacity. The inmates of the Ashram do not live in it under compulsion. Nobody, therefore, should feel the burden of work there.
 Read my letter to Dr. Sharma. Talk to him. Do also give him whatever facilities he wants. Let him examine all the patients I have mentioned and others who may be ill. Let me know the results and your views. You will find in my letter to him that I have written at sufficient length, and I, therefore, don’t repeat all that here.
 With all my efforts I could not find Valji’s article. But he came and gave me a copy.
 Did I give you the address to which the Gandiva spinning- wheels should be despatched? There is a slight change in it now: Shri Haribhau Phatak, Pioneer Dyeing Works, Sadashiv Peth, Poona City.
 Lakshmibehn, Narmada, Bhuskute and Amtussalaam—the last if she is permitted by Dr. Sharma and if she is very keen— may come next Saturday. I am sending a wirelibtech_716_footnotetoday, for you may not get this letter in time.
 Ramji has asked for permission to put his grievances before Rajbhoj. If you think it desirable, you yourself may talk to the latter. He is a man of a suspicious nature and may misinterpret even your doing that. In view of this possibility, think independently and do what seems best to you.
   [PS.]  BAPU    	I was forgetting one thing. You have heard about N. She came 
  	and saw me some time ago. She has a son who lives with her. I had 	heard reports against her and so had invited her here. She was doing 	Harijan work in Bangalore. She is a capable lady, and is an American 	married to a Greek. Her father was a theatre designer. She herself 	can act and knows dancing, etc. You must have read about three years 	ago that she had become a Hindu in Kashmir and was thinking of 	coming to the Ashram. The report was true. But she was also  living  	an ignorant life. She has freely led an immoral life and even 	accepted money from people. When she came to me, she confessed to me 	all her errors one after another and gave her solemn word that she 	would devote the rest of her life to Harijan work. She says she is 	24 years old. She left the hotel where she was staying and went to 	live among Harijans. At present she is living in a Harijan hamlet at 	some distance from Bangalore. She writes to me from time to time. I 	think she has changed and is on the right path now. I have wired to 	her and asked her to come here. I intend to send her ultimately to 	the Ashram. I don’t see any risk in taking her in. She will stay 	if she can observe the rules. Let all of you think about this and 	then communicate your view to me. If you wish to ask me anything 	more, you may do so. You    
 need not send Poore’s book to her just now. She has not yet arrived here.

  	Your letter containing your views of the conduct of the Ashram came 	in yesterday, i.e., Wednesday.  	There is a difference in our ideal[s] perhaps. I contemplate a 	composite society at any rate for some long time to come. The ideal 	should be what it is. Some will reach it more and some less. You 	will find that the only ideal that can be fully reached according to 	the definition is that of Truth. For Truth is what everyone for the 	moment feels it to be as such, there being no room left for 	deception. It will always be non-physical, whereas every other vow 	has its  direct physical aspect and therefore necessarily has 	grades. Take ahimsa. One person will be satisfied with its mere 	observance with the non-killing of man and beast. Another will 	extend it to the insect life, yet others to the vegetable and so on. 	We do not consider it an unpardonable crime to kill a snake or a 	scorpion. Take non-posse- ssion. Even you and I have no common line. 	I may possess a fountain pen, you may discard it. I may possess ten 	yards of khadi, you may have twenty. There is no such thing as full 	and equal observance of these other vows which admit of a physical 	expression. They subserve    
 the one and only grand purpose and ideal, Truth. Kusum lying on her deathbed (maybe) and requiring hundreds of things I may not want, as fully lives up to the Ashram ideal as I, if both of us think, speak and act truthfully.
 If you have followed me hitherto, you must at once perceive that we do not need, we must not have bifurcation. Living the composite life, each must grow to his or her full height. If I cannot even at the age of 64 live up to the life of brahmacharya, I must humbly own it and retire from the Ashram without the finger of scorn being pointed at me. I must get credit for having courage to think, speak and act the truth. There is then hope for my brahmacharya but none for say . . .libtech_718_footnoteif he has outwardly quite correctly lived a life of physical brahmacharya but has lusted after a girl or girls. libtech_719_footnotehas disgraced the
 Ashram, not I.
 Therefore if we will practise charity and Truth we can only have one institution wherein you must have the fullest scope for your  growth and Kusum the invalid for hers or libtech_720_footnotelibtech_721_footnotethe butterfly for hers,
 provided that none of you deceives for one single moment and each believes in and strives to reach the Ashram ideal.
 Now comes in, in a different or modified form, your proposal. A separate institution or institutions. There is one at Wardha with Vinoba at its head. He is part of the parent institution and is working out the ideals to the best of his capacity. Did I tell you that with my full consent, he had run away from Wardha and settled in a Harijan village hardly two miles from Wardha? He may leave a landmark there and go fifty miles or more away from any railway line with or without a companion still in fulfilment of the ideal of the parent [institution] and being an integral part of it. He is in no way superior to      libtech_722_footnotelibtech_723_footnote,
assuming always that.	libtech_724_footnotelibtech_725_footnoteis as truthful as Vinoba and is as much
 carrying out the Ashram ideal as Vinoba. Are you able to perceive this fully?
 There is another branch shooting out in Almora far away from the haunts of men and a long way from a railway line. Struggling Prabhudas is today in physical charge of it. But how ultimately it will
 
 shape, I do not know. It may become a sanatorium for the invalids or may become a retreat, permanent or temporary, for those who want isolation for their growth. And if we succeed in continually throwing out untruth from the Ashram and learn to live only truth and for it and nothing else, we may have a million branches, none superior, none inferior, all being an expression of the hardy parent and required for it. I do not know whether I have expressed myself so as to enable you to understand me. Follow it up as much as you like. No letter going to Ba this week.
Love from us all to all.

 DEAR FRIEND,
 I have your letter. Whether you have an idol or whether you are in a temple or a church or a mosque or out in the open air, you pray only to one God who is in everything and who is all-eyes and all-ears.
 The wearing of the yellow robe I do not consider to be at all necessary for a brahmachari. In ancient times it was undoubtedly a symbol that distinguished the brahmachari from the householder, and members of a particular institution may, if they wish to, adopt a parti- cular costume for themselves.
 I think that you did well in not observing any distinction bet- ween your fellow-students or workers, whether Harijans or others, at the time of shraddha ceremonylibtech_733_footnote.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 Some of the points in your letter in the big mail received yesterday require immediate reply, and I am, therefore, writing this letter today without delay.
 I am glad that Lakshmibehn has agreed to golibtech_738_footnotefor  one  year.  I will now get into correspondence with the people concerned. I think whatever is done will be done after Jamnalalji’s release. Probably it will not be necessary for two women to go at the same time.
What shall we do if Chimanlal loses heart?
 After reading Dr. Talwalkar’s letter, I feel that it will be best for Kusum to remain under his treatment.
 Keep the letter for Pannalal with you and give it to him at the appropriate time.
 The changes which you have made seem to be all right. The burden of work on Prema ought to be reduced. If she does not stop speaking for the present, I see a grave risk. Be strict with her in this matter.
 Let Parachure Shastri conduct as many classes as he can. If people can be taught to recite the Gita verses with correct pronuncia- tion, I will regard that as a great thing.
 Do give him all the books which we have. I have explained in my letter how they should be used. Kaka tells me that the other four books which he requires are there in the Vidyapith. If Panditji asks for them or if Narahari Parikh permits, we may have them transferred to the Ashram.
 We have, in any case, to ask for the transfer of some manu- scripts. It is only a question of time. Ask Shastri to be patient.

 April 20, 1933
 BHAISHRI FULCHAND,
 At last I got a letter from you after waiting for one for a long time. All of us were wondering why there was no letter and were, therefore, very much pleased when we got it.
 I cannot understand what happened to my letter. My atitude in the matter is that we should write what we wish to, and not worry whether or not the letter reaches the addressee.
Our life goes on from day to day.
 We often think about your enlarged family there, but feel sure that, since you are quite a few veterans there, things are going on without friction. If an accident occurs to a railway train, a good many people will die. If, on the other hand, anything happens to an old-fashioned cart, at the most the riders feel a jerk. They do a few repairs to the cart and jump on to it again. Before the age of the railway, the pace of things was slow. But we rarely find this from reading history. But we do hear about the increase in accidents and lunatic asylums. However, sanatanist friends argue that I have no right at all to talk about these things, since, though I write against trains, doctors, etc., I am eager enough to travel by train whenever I get an opportunity and a bicycle runs down to Dr. Kanuga’s dispensary the
 
 moment I have an inflammation in one of the eyes. This is quite true. But poor sanatanists, do they know that during the last fifteen months I have not stepped into a train even once nor sent anybody bicycling to Dr. Kanuga?
 Tell Surendra that to get cough and low fever is against the rules of the Ashram. How did he get them? He should write to me in detail or someone else should, whose turn it may be to write. Darbari may not have used many of his turns; if so, let him use one of them for writing to me. I hope Surendra gets regulation food for a  sick  prisoner. I suppose Vithal knows that his father and sisters have returned to the Ashram.
 I have one golden suggestion for safeguarding health. Anybody who finds that a certain item of food does not agree with him should leave it. Nobody dies for remaining hungry, whereas it can be proved that 999 people out of a thousand fall ill through over-eating or  eating wrong things. I can say much else, but it will serve no purpose.
 If you or any other friends wish to discuss with me any  questions in connection with the movement against untouchability, you will be permitted to see me. Of course you should not ask for such permission if you have nothing to discuss with me about that subject.
 And now the replies to the questions asked by Mohanlal, the school-teacher from Bavla:
  By 	 abhyasalibtech_740_footnotelibtech_741_footnotethe  Gita means regular reading of something which 	is worth 	pondering over, though one 	may not feel interested 	in it. 	Such regular 	study enables one to 	maintain the 	current of 	one’s thoughts in the right direction. The Lord has coupled  vairagyalibtech_742_footnotelibtech_743_footnotewith 	abhyasa. 	But the two things 	are practically 	the same. 	Fixing one’s mind 	in abhyasa 	necessarily means 	withdrawing it from 	other things, 	and that 	is vairagya.  Prasad 	may be 	described as 	serene contentment. 	We feel 	contented when 	we get 	the things of 	the world 	which we desire, 	but such 	contentment is 	useless and 	springs from the 	satisfaction of 	the senses. 	Since the goods of 	the world are 	short-lived, the 	contentment which 	they bring 	is also 	short-lived. The 	goods of 	spiritual life 	are eternal possessions, and so the contentment produced by them is also 
 
 
 abiding. It is an experience beyond the grasp of the senses, an experience of the mind and the heart. One can, therefore, feel true contentment only when one becomes indifferent to the happiness of the senses. This is the contentment that the Gita talks about.
Regards from us all to everybody there. I got Raojibhai’s letter.
 I will reply to him by and by.

518,"April 21, 1933",HOW DOES THE STREAM OF BHAKTI FLOW?,"
         [April 21, 1933]libtech_745_footnote A 	lover of the Bhagavata dharma writes:libtech_746_footnote  	The stream of bhakti does not flow from the pen. It is not a 	matter pertaining to the intellect. That stream can only flow from 	the cavern of the heart; and when it does flow, no power will be 	able to stop its current. Who can stop the current of the Ganga?  	I am indeed trying for such bhakti but the effort cannot 	succeed through any verbal grandeur. The only way to it is 	karmayoga. A      
 total indifference towards the result is necessary for that yoga. Karmayoga is but another name for action which is wholly devoid of any desire for results.
 Hence, I do not see the need to write any article specially in order to make the stream of devotion flow. If every word of the Harijan—whether it is in English, Hindi or Gujarati—is an echo of the devotion which is within, it will automatically make an impression.
 I have grasped the intention of the lover of the Bhagavata dharma. If there is devotion within me, and, to the extent that it is there, that devotion will not fail to touch others. This is because I believe that a change of heart can be brought about through the Bhagavata dharma alone. That dharma is contagious. Once it is revealed, it does not leave anyone untouched. When it is truly revealed in any of us, the Harijans and the sanatanists will  automatically become aware of it. This at least I can say for myself that all my actions—writing, speaking, walking—are undertaken with the object of generating devotion within me. It is my confirmed belief that if Hinduism is to be saved, there is no other way to do so.
 Religion has never been, and can never be, saved through hooliganism or hypocrisy, through rhetoric or beautiful articles. Religion can be saved only through the purification and penance professing it. And, the author of the Bhagavata has clearly stated that in this age the path of bhakti alone can be pursued of those without difficulty; perhaps it is the sole path.
 The question may then arise why I write or speak. The answer is contained in what I have stated above regarding my actions. That activity itself shows that even if there has been any flowering of the Bhagavata dharma in me, it can in no way be said to have attained perfection; and my activity in that direction is for that very development. And, if that is really so, others will catch a glimpse of devotion in one or the other of these activities.

  "
519,,FIVE QUESTIONS ON VARNADHARMA,"
    
A gentleman has sent me the following questions:
  What 	work should the Brahmin, the Kshatriya, the Vaishya and the Shudra 	do to earn 	their livelihood? In 	what way should the four varnas serve?  Can 	work for livelihood be 	the same as 	work for service? 	Or are 	the two different?  You 	have written that “in 	order to 	revive varnashrama it 	is necessary that 	all should 	voluntarily become 	Shudras”. If 	the other 	three varnas (the 	Brahmin, the 	Kshatriya, the 	Vaishya) embrace the 	Shudra varna, will they 	not be guilty of the sin of giving up their dharma and adopting another?  You 	have written, 	“A small 	varna aspiring to 	Brahmajnana 	fortunately exists 	today through which sanatana dharma will again shine in 	its purity 	and show the world the path to happiness.” What is that varna? 
I seek to prevent no one from asking questions. But I must say
 that if my writings were read carefully many questions that are asked would be answered of themselves. An article in which questions raised in it are not answered is considered useless. Articles treating of moral questions should not be read only once. If such an article is read over and over again with concentration, then the questions included in  them solve themselves easily. I should therefore request the correspondent to reread my article on varnashrama. He will then find that what I am going to say here is already contained in it. I address this suggestion to the readers in general. Let not the correspondent think that it applies only to him. The habit of reading is increasing in us, but the habit of pondering is diminishing and therefore we have become somewhat helpless. On everything we want to know another’s opinion. We have lost the power of original thinking which comes from constant pondering. It is truly pitiable that things have come to such a pass. Once a principle is understood we should have the capacity to understand its corrolaries. With just a little practice this power can be developed.
I shall now answer the questions:
  The 	Brahmin will impart 	to society knowledge 	of the 	Brahman. The 	Kshatriya will 	protect the country. 	The Vaishya 	will earn wealth through trade and commerce. The Shudra will do service. 
 All these will earn their livelihood each by doing the work of his own varna. That will be enough.
  Varna, 	strictly speaking, is 	a duty 	not a 	right. Hence 	the existence 	of varna 	can only 	be for 	service, not 	for self. For 	this reason 	there is 	no one high and no 	one low. A 	man who considers 	himself above 	others, is 	worse than a 	fool despite 	all his wisdom. 	Because of his 	arrogance or 	superiority he falls 	from varna. 	Here, it is also 	necessary to 	understand that 	there is 	nothing in 	varnashrama to 	 prevent a 	Shudra from acquiring 	learning or defending 	his country; 	yes, the 	Shudra may 	not barter his 	knowledge or 	take to 	defending his 	country for 	purposes of 	livelihood. It 	is also not 	enjoined that 	the Brahmin 	or the 	Kshatriya may 	not do menial 	work. But they must not 	earn their livelihood 	from such 	work. If this simple 	dharma were 	scrupulously followed, 	all the disorders 	that face society today, all 	the jealousies 	and rivalries 	that are rampant, 	all this 	craze to amass 	wealth, all 	the falsehood that 	is prevalent, 	all this 	production of 	weapons of 	war would 	vanish. Whether the 	whole world follows this 	principle or 	not, whether 	all Hindus 	do so or not, 	even if some 	follow this, the 	world will gain by 	so much. My 	faith that the 	salvation of 	the world 	lies in following 	varnadharma grows 	stronger each day. 	The true 	meaning of 	varnadharma is 	service. Whatever is 	done should 	be done 	in the spirit of 	service. Where is bargaining in service? 
 Now comes the question of manual labour. As far as I understand the Gita, it mentions many kinds of yajnas. One of them is manual labour. It is the duty of all the castes to do manual labour as yajna for the preservation of the world. No one can escape this yajna. Without body labour the journey of life itself is impossible. He who does not perform this yajna of labour is truly a thief. To say that manual labour is meant for Shudras only shows ignorance of dharma. Work of service does not necessarily mean manual work. He who washes his own dishes is doing manual work but not work of service. A watchman who earns his livelihood by standing at the gate does no manual work; but he certainly does work of service.
 There 	is no need 	now to answer 	this question.  In 	asking this question, my 	correspondent has 	perhaps forgotten that 	in my opinion 	varnadharma today is 	all but destroyed. 	Brahmins, Kshatriyas and 	Vaishyas have 	long since given up 	their varna 	duties and arrogated 	rights. The sin has been 	committed. Now 	the Brahmins, Kshatriyas 	and Vaishyas, 	who have fallen from 
 varnadharma can by voluntarily embracing Shudradharma absolve themselves of the sin. They never had any right to treat the Shudras as low-born.
  Those 	who follow 	the Bhagavata 	dharma and, for 	love of 	God, barely earning 	their livelihood, always serve their fellow-beings, 	impart divine knowledge 	to the 	world. There is 	no doubt about this. 	There are 	among them men 	of learning 	as well 	as without 	learning. They 	do not 	make a show 	of their 	work. I do 	not know them all by 	their names. 	But I 	know that there are such 	people even 	though their number is 	very small.

520,,HOW CAN THE BIRTHLESS BE BORN?,"
    
 The teacher with whose conundrums relating to temples I dealt in an earlier articlelibtech_747_footnoteagain writes:libtech_748_footnote
 There are many principles in Hinduism which are compre- hensible to reason and many others that transcend reason. The doc- trine of incarnation is a matter of reason as well as of faith. In so far as it is a matter of faith, I do not think that there will be books explaining it as there are books explaining material things. There are some books on this subject in English, but even they do not fully satisfy the mind. Possibly there are works on this subject in Sanskrit but I do not know about them. I owe my faith in incarnation to Tulsidas. I would advise seekers after truth like this teacher to study the works of Tulsidas. If anyone knows any work on this subject, I would request him to in- form me about it, so that I can write to the teacher. But what is needed in matters such as incarnation is not books so much as reflection.
 Now let us consider the matter on the plane of reason. Whatever qualities are attributed to God, are also attributed to the atman. Just as God is unborn, unageing and undying, so is the atman. The atman is an eternal part of God, and that is why it possesses the attributes of God. The atman is birthless and yet is born in body and therefore it
 
 must be considered as a partial incarnation of God. If we take this view, there should be no difficulty in considering one in whom many qualities of God are present, an incarnation of God. Full incarnation cannot be understood through the intellect. This is a matter of imagination as well as of faith. The Hindu, from the circumstances of his past births and his present birth, will consider Rama, Krishna and others as incarnations of God. One who sees God in the  whole universe, should be accepted as an incarnation of God. Just as we see a mass of water as the sea, in the same way why can we not see the world of living things as an incarnation of God? Whether we call this an incarnation or not is a different matter. We are not concerned with name. This world is pervaded by God. Wherever we look there is only God. That which has name and form is an incarnation of God; so much should be clear to the eyes of faith. If we can but have this much of faith in our hearts, it is very possible that we would keep clear of sins. Knowing well that God dwells in every heart, why should we follow the path of falsehood and why should we sin?

  	I have your long letter giving me your views about the proposed 	visit to British Guiana, South Africa, etc. I think that these 	outposts have come to abide with you. I do not need any elaborate 	argument to convince me of it. Now and again you are bound to 	receive a call from them and it is best to respond to such calls. 	You should therefore undoubtedly go to British Guiana, and then to 	South Africa, then to East Africa and return via India. That will 	give you mental satisfaction, keep you up to date with the things 	for which you have qualified yourself and it will give satisfaction 	to the people concerned, and the work that you can do in these 	several parts, you alone can do. It does not matter a bit whether it 	appears today substantial or insubstantial, and whilst you are 	absent on duty from England you will believe, I shall certainly 	believe, that it will not suffer because you will be absent, not for 	your pleasure, but on duty. 
 I hope that the care about your brother has not proved too great for you and that his removal to a hospital has benefited him.

  	I have your letter and also the old articles which will  be  	returned. It appears that with the cessation of intensive propaganda 	activity the work on the eradication of untouchability has 	slackened. But I like it. This work does not require rushing, there 	should be no rush in religious matters. Only what is done in a calm 	manner proves to be true and solid work. I think it is necessary to 	take a consensus of opinion, but I have some doubt about its being 	performed in a true spirit. Discuss this with Thakkar Bapa and 	Ghanshyamdas and then let me know. Only a truly religious person can 	take up the responsibility of this job. Have you any such person in 	mind?  	I would prefer that even others devoted to Harijan service do not 	enter the temples where Harijans are not allowed. This  is  more 	difficult than the former undertaking, it may involve breach of 	peace and some propaganda ought to precede picketing. Talk over this 	matter too and write to me again. Also, who can organize this work? 	We must first have a picture of it before I start writing about it 	in the papers.

537,,REMEMBER 30TH APRILlibtech_775_footnote,"
         	Those who would organize a proper concentrated programme for 30th 	instant, the day fixed as Harijan Day, would do well to take time by 	the forelock and make all preparations in a methodical manner. Every 	Committee is free to add to or subtract from the items  I have 	suggested.  	I hope it is clearly understood that, where no other work is at all 	possible, there will be at least substantial collections made. I 	know that collectors often despise copper collections. Let me remind 	them of the English proverb: “Take care of your pennies, and the 	pounds will take care of themselves.” And let me give a tit-bit 	from my own experience as an expert collector. Among the masses I 	remember having collected not pice, i.e., quarteranna pieces, but 	pies, in Orissa, and when the collections were counted, the total 	was a respectable amount. We are a country of many millions and, 	therefore, in my opinion, the copper pies of the millions have, when 	put together, an infinitely greater value than the rupees of a few 	thousand middle-class men or a few lakhs from half a dozen 	millionaires. If the collectors      
 will have faith in themselves, in their cause and in the masses, they will go from door to door and collect whatever coppers are given. A pie given with a full heart will be to me a token that the giver wants untouchability to go and that he or she has contributed his or her mite towards the movement. If the Committees will make a faithful report of the results of their collections and show not only how much they have collected but also from how many people, it will give one a fair index of the strength of the movement. Needless to say, the work must be done quietly and as gently as possible, and when it is done without fuss by door-to-door visits, there need be no opposition from any quarter. Where householders are unwilling to give anything, there should be no argument with them, no ill will shown towards them. The donations must be free-will offerings.
 One thing I would suggest to the medical fraternity. I have just had a report from the schoolmaster whose doings I am noting in these columns from time to time, showing the need  Harijans  have  of medical assistance. In the case I have in mind, a  physician, immediately a case of pneumonia was reported to him, went free of charge to the Harijan quarters and not only gave relief in  this  particular case, but, much to the delight of the Harijans, examined the other cases and offered to go freely whenever his assistance was needed. It will be a striking demonstration if the medical men in every part of India met together and appointed visitors from among themselves to go to the Harijan quarters, speak to the inmates on the necessity of observing the laws of hygiene and sanitation and offer medical relief wherever it was required. Naturally, this work to be done on an ambitious scale can only be done without expectation of any fees. No organization can undertake the task of rewarding the services that the medical men might render to Harijans; whereas, if the medical men took this burden upon themselves, there are so many now in India that by a judicious distribution of work no pressure will be felt by any single physician.
 The third thing that occurs to me is for the women workers all over the country to combine in order to do away with the inhuman practice of giving to Harijans the leavings of food. I have a letterlibtech_776_footnotefrom a Harijan in Karachi who asks in piteous terms that the women might at least shoulder the burden of having this reform accomplished at once. He says that they think nothing of giving to Harijans food
 
 that is rotten and unfit for human consumption, food that is stinking, that is dirty beyond description, and this too, lest they might be polluted, they throw from their balconies or from their verandahs into the laps of debased Harijans; and he adds in agony, “The pity of it is that the Harijans would feel it a deprivation if these leavings were not given to them.” It would certainly be a grand thing if earnest women all over banded themselves together and made it a point of seeing their sisters and weaning them from the practice. I have every hope that in this mission of mercy and humanity even the sanatanists will co-operate; but whether they do or not, the duty before the women who realize the abomination of the practice is to bestir themselves and quicken the conscience of their sisters who do not even perhaps know that they are offending humanity by making themselves responsible for the degradation of those who are, after all, their own kith and kin. And in this connection, I would invite the attention of workers to the concrete suggestions I made the other day in answer to a Dehra Dun student.libtech_777_footnote

 "
538,,WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HARIJAN,"
    
 Elsewherelibtech_778_footnotethe reader will find how the Harijans fare in the city of Allahabad in the north, known to the millions of Hindus as Prayag, one of the most noted among the places of Hindu pilgrimage and situated at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna.
 Let him turn also to the extreme south. There he will find a cluster of villages inhabited by the land-owning ryots known as  Nattars and their landless ‘semi-slaves’, the Harijans. There was a conflict between these two during May, June and July last year. There was also a resolution in the Madras Council, carried by 44  votes against 22, recommending to the Government the appointment of a committee to inquire into and report on the alleged atrocities committed by the Nattars on the Harijans. Nothing is said as yet to have been done by the Government on the recommendation.
Sjt. Amritlal Thakkar has, however, sent me a fairly full report.
 
 The subject is still topical, inasmuch as the trouble is by no means over and may burst forth any moment. The two sections are living, as it were, in a state of armed neutrality. The inquiry was conducted by Sjt. A. Rangaswami Iyengar, Advocate, and President of the District Harijan Committee, Sjt. Lakshmiratan Bharati, Advocate,  and Secretary of the District Committee, Sjt. V. E. Eapen, Advocate, and Sjt. Ramachandran, the Secretary of the Tamilnad Board, S.U.S. They visited Devakottah, Pavanakottah, Paramakkudi, Eluvankottah and Chittanur. The trouble began during the temple festival at Eluvankottah. The Harijans “till recently had to work for the Nattars on conditions prescribed by the latter”.
 During the trouble the Nattars raided the village (Pavanakottah) and looted the Harijan houses. They tied some of the Harijans, who wanted to resist, to a tree. The little schoolhouse in the Harijan quarter was burnt
 down. The little granaries made of cow-dung and hay in front of most Harijan houses were broken to bits and the grain looted. These granaries look more like huge jars than like rooms. We saw the ruins of a schoolhouse and the grain jars.
The report proceeds:
 The Harijans themselves include two divisions—Pallas and Pariahs. The Pallas ran away at the first sign of trouble to Devakottah, leaving their women and children in the village, who were considerably harassed by the raiders. Quite a number of these Pallas were Christians even before. The Pariahs met with more trouble. The Christian pastor who did the conversion now pays a weekly visit for prayer meetings and general propaganda. He has also consented to give them a new school of their own. The Pallas returned to their homes earlier and the Pariahs a little later.
 Four  families  consisting  of   14   members  embraced  Christianity	3
 months ago. It is expected more families will follow suit. As far as we could ascertain, there is no trouble between the converts and the Harijans. In answer to our questions, one of the converted men said that they had become Christians because the missionaries promised them protection and care.
The Harijans told the Committee:
 The Nattars want us to observe exactly old customs and manners. They do not like our men to wear shirts or upper clothes as we like, or our women to put on frocks and saris. The old custom was that our clothes should not go below the knee and any upper cloth should be tied round the loins only. The women were not allowed to cover their bodies above the waist, except with their hands. In the old times, in religious processions, we had to go doing a
 particular dance. Even today, the Harijans on meeting a Nattar has to say “sevakam” meaning “at your service”. They do not allow us to work where we like or for whom we like. We have to work for them for what wages they give and wherever they order. They do not like us to use brass vessels and are angry when our women put on ornaments. Only two weeks ago, in a near village, Paramakkudi, a woman who went with a frock was spat upon by a Nattar and asked not to be arrogant in the Nattar street.
A Nattar Headman stated as  follows:
 We have no quarrel with the Harijans. Only we do not want him to go against old customs and conventions. He now refuses to work for us. He asks for high wages. We don’t much mind his putting on shirt or his women having ornaments or frocks in his own village. We only object to his parading them in our village and during the temple festival, when there are large crowds of all kinds of people. If their men and women dress as the rest of us, how can we differentiate them among the festival crowds? This results in a general mix-up and consequent pollution. We have no objection to their dress, as they want it, but our difficulty is: how are we to distinguish them in a crowd? We don’t object to their going to schools, but if they come to a common school, they must sit separate. We know very well that they cannot remain exactly where they were in old times. But we are bound to resist arrogance and revolt.
The agony need not be protracted. Instances elsewhere of
 resentment of and assault on Harijans dressing well or Harijan brides and bridegrooms carried in palanquins in their marriage procession have come to light.libtech_779_footnoteIt is up to sanatanists to join hands with reformers and put an end to the arrogation of superiority by one caste over another in the name of religion.
 The reader will be glad to know that the Committee do not propose to be satisfied with the mere investigation they have made, important as it is. They have followed it up by a visit to the sub- collector, who has promised protection, should there be trouble, which is said to be impending in a village called Uruvatti during a coming festival. The members are also seeking the assistance of influential Nattars and other well-known men living in the neighbourhood in bringing about honourable peace between the Nattars  and  the Harijans.
 They feel, too, that “nothing but education will finally solve the difficulty”. They have, therefore, proposed that a string of schools
 
 should be opened throughout the districts, both day and  night  schools. Let us wish success to the laudable efforts of the Committee in both the directions.

 "
539,,IMMEDIATE DUTY,"
    
 The Allahabad branch of the Servants of Untouchables Society (U.P. Provincial Board) had appointed a committee consisting of Sjts.
 P. N. Sapru, Bisheshwar Prasad and Ramnath Dar to report upon the condition of the Harijans of that city and to recommend measures for its amelioration. The Committee has presented an elaborate report covering fifty-eight pages of typed matter, excluding appendices. The Committee is to be congratulated on its production. One misses in the report the number of the Harijan population. The city excluding the cantonment has a population of only 1,73,895.
 I do not propose to deal with the whole of this important document. Those who would study it should procure a copy from the Allahabad Office.
 The Mehtars and the Doms are by far the most ill-treated and uncared for? not only by the savarna Hindus but also by all the citizens represented by the cosmopolitan municipality.
This is what the Committee says about their condition:
 The very approach to depressed-class quarters has a most depressing effect upon one’s mind. Some of the quarters in which they live, particularly those in the heart of the city, are literally unfit for human habitation. The houses are dark, dreary and damp. They do not look like places of human habitation. Their houses generally consist of one room of 5 square yards, in which a whole family of four to six has to live. There is no light and air in these houses, no verandah or open space in front and no arrangement for latrine, kitchen or bath. The lanes in front of these houses are extremely narrow, kutcha, muddy, without any drain or light. The whole atmosphere of these localities is foul; there are hardly any arrangements for sanitation; and the sights one sees there are disgusting and loathsome. Not much can be expected of human beings who have to live not more than seven feet from scandalously dirty public lavatories. We have found taps attached to these lavatories for the domestic and bathing purposes of the sweepers living in the vicinity. One is filled with shame and horror at the discovery that there are places (in the twentieth century) in a city, which claims to be the capital of a
 
 big Province and which has a developed public life, where large groups of men, women and children lead a paralysed existence in the midst of all this filth and dirt. Who can belittle the importance of physical surroundings upon man’s character? Little wonder, then, that the “untouchable” is now lost to all sense of the clean and the beautiful in life. The tyranny of society sits tight upon him; he has little initiative and less independence left. It is hard to write with restraint about the conditions in which the Mehtar is compelled to live, and we would request earnestly all those who are interested in social welfare work to verify for themselves the accuracy of our statements by visits to, say, the Phul Talab, Bhainsa Godown or the Kali Mai-ka-Than in Allahabad.
Of Kali Mai-ka-Than the report says:
 According to Municipal estimates, 1192 men and 1220 women visit these latrines daily. There is no light in these latrines, with the result that men have to ease themselves in the evening in the open space outside. The inmates of the houses facing the latrine use the space between the latrines and their houses as their courtyard and playground for their children. There is no wall round the latrine, with the result that the lower part of the person using them can be seen from the houses of sweepers. There are separate blocks for men and women in this latrine, but the wall dividing the blocks is low and a man who stands on the khuddi can see the women on the other side. There is only one tap and that, too, near the latrine and quite close to a cesspool. The water supply is irregular and wholly inadequate. The tap is used both for cleaning the latrines and bathing and domestic purposes. The cesspools attached to the latrines often overflow with urine and are in a most insanitary condition. Sweepers have to go down into the cesspools barefooted for the purpose of cleaning them thoroughly. Both the land lying about the locality and the main lane are kutcha and get muddy in the rainy season. There is no platform for transferring night-soil from the public and private latrines into the night-soil carts. Sweepers have to mount the cart with heavy loads of dirt in order to place the night-soil into the carts. Most of the receptacles in the latrines are in a damaged condition. Being also small, they get filled up soon and filth overflows them and passes along with urine and water into the cesspools.
 The number of night-soil carts is four only. We have seen sweepers throwing the contents of their tokras containing human excreta on the ground on account of the carts being too full. We claim that the facts stated above cannot be challenged.
In my estimation, everything else  in   the   report  pales   into in
 significance compared to this. That the other cities, if there was the same investigation as at Allahabad, are likely to show the same woeful
 state of things or that the latter has gone on for years would be no excuse for continuing the condition revealed by the report. When a snake is discovered in a house, one does not delay its removal because it is also discovered that it had been there for years. The plague spot of Allahabad is worse than the imagined snake in the imagined house.  I hope that the members of the committee and the Allahabad Branch of the Society will not rest nor give rest to the Municipality of Allahabad, till the disgraceful condition is radically altered and these most useful members of society are decently housed in a decent spot.  I know a case in which fifteen hundred inhabitants of a plague spot were removed within twenty-four hours of the outbreak of plague in their midst and housed in tents till permanent quarters were found elsewhere.libtech_780_footnotelibtech_781_footnotelibtech_782_footnoteThis case demands  no  less  summary  measures.  And  if Allahabad leads the way, I have little doubt that the other cities will follow.
 Harijan, 22-4-1933
 "
540,,A HARIJAN SEVAK’S DIFFICULTY,"
    
A Harijan sevak writes:
 You know that the anti-untouchability worker has to suffer at the hands of the orthodox priests. They refuse to officiate at religious ceremonies at the homes of such workers. You have statedlibtech_783_footnotelibtech_784_footnotein the  Harijan No. 4 that the reformers should learn to dispense with the outward form. Will you not dispense with the priest altogether? The latter works only for money. Many priests to my knowledge do not even pronounce the mantras accurately; still fewer know their meaning. They trade on the gullibility of the public. What merit can such officiating carry with it? Such humbug is more rampant at places of pilgrimage than elsewhere. I am myself a Brahmin. The upanayanam ceremony was performed upon me when I was 13 years old. At the end of the ceremony, the priest said I was a Shudra up to the time that I was without the sacred thread, but that, having put on the sacred thread, I became a Brahmin. I had to repeat this formula before my parents when I went to make obeisance to
 
 
 them. Here the idea given to me was that after having taken the sacred thread I had risen to a higher status. How do you reconcile this with your claim that there is no high-and-low status in Hinduism?
 I want to tell you another thing. When I was at school, our class had a debate on untouchability. An orthodox teacher presided on the occasion. I remember his having said something like this: Our womenfolk become untouchable every month and are treated like any other untouchable. Then, why should we not observe such untouchability regarding those who are called untouchables?
 I have considerably abridged what is a long letter from this correspondent. What he says about the ignorance of many priests and the show that they make of learning is unfortunately only too true. The remedy for it is a general levelling up of the character of the people and the spread of the right stamp of education, including a workable knowledge of Sanskrit. I believe in the great power which Vivekananda used to ascribe to Sanskrit. We are unnecessarily frightened by the difficulty of learning Sanskrit. For a persevering student it is no more difficult than any of the other languages. I do not mean that we can easily gain a knowledge of Sanskrit that would enable us to understand the intricacies of ancient texts, but  I  do suggest that to gain a workable knowledge of Sanskrit, to acquire the correct pronunciation, so as to be able to know whether the priest is performing his task correctly or whether a pandit is misleading us, is not a difficult task, certainly not one-tenth as difficult as it is to  acquire an equivalent knowledge of English. And then it must not be forgotten that such a knowledge of Sanskrit gives one a master-key to the knowledge of the majority of Indian languages, not excluding the Southern group.
 But I must not stray away from my subject. Till this happy day arrives, we have to do the best we can with the tools at our disposal. And if we cannot get a trustworthy Brahmin priest to officiate, the Bhagavata and the later saints have supplied us with an incredibly simple solution. At every ceremony, whether it is in connection with marriage, birth or death or any other religious function, the uttering of the sacred name from the heart is enough to ensure the presence and benediction of God at the ceremony. The fact is that God is there all the time, only we do not realize it. The recitation of the sacred
 name, hallowed by the practice of an unbroken line of saints, wakes us from our ignorance and works as infallibly as an electric spark, and immediately makes the presence of God felt in our midst. I say this only for those who have faith. Those who have none should dismiss it from their minds altogether. For them, even the presence of the orthodox priest is a mere mechanical act, an ignorant obedience to custom. They derive no advantage, no merit from the act. An honest orthodox priest has a place in the Hindu family. He is fast losing it by his own folly. He may be safe if he sheds his laziness, his ignorance, and, what is worse, his dishonesty. The present movement is indirectly intended to effect that reform. Seeing that the movement is one of internal purification, we shall never achieve it, unless there is a general sweeping up of all that is evil. Who can make the real beginning, if not he who calls himself a Brahmin?
 As for the upanayanam ceremony, though I have discarded it myself, it has, there is no doubt, a deep meaning. The sacred thread is  a sign of new birth, a regeneration. Before the adoption of the thread, there is but one birth, that is the physical. The adoption of the thread is a sign of the second birth, that is the spiritual. It is a sign of initiation—of a new life of dedication to God. It is, therefore, a higher life in the sense of greater responsibility in relation to oneself, but it gives one no greater status in relation to his neighbour. Indeed, at the time of initiation, there ought to be a definite realization that from that date one becomes a servant of the poorest and the lowliest. And to my mind, the thought that all are Shudras till the ceremony of initiation and dedication is a beautiful and ennobling thought. Unfortunately, these rites which were intended to emphasize human duties have been abused for the sake of exploitation and usurpation.
 As to the comparison of the untouchability of the womenfolk with the untouchability that we observe today in respect of nearly 40 million human beings, it is a violence done to truth. The temporary untouchability of the womenfolk attaches to a temporary condition of the body. The untouchability of the untouchable millions is  a  hallmark of suppressed humanity and it attaches to birth, irrespective of a change in their condition. The one has in its reasonable form a rational basis for it, the other is wholly irrational and based upon an ignorant and selfish interpretation of the Shastras.

  "
541,,A FRIEND’S WARNINGlibtech_785_footnote,"
    
 When you embarked on the great struggle for the liberation of the suppressed classes, I was exhilarated for the time being, but my difficulty began soon after. All these days I was debating whether to write you or not, but now the thing haunts me during my sleep and disturbs my meals. Hence this letter.
 Years ago my friends and I began work for the untouchables in the hope that they and we and all would forget the very name ‘untouchable’. We dreamt that we would do away with separate schools, separate wells, separate sports and the like. When, therefore, you began your crusade, I was elated with hope that untouchability would be banished from India and that untouchables would be absorbed in the Hindu mass.
 But I am stunned by what you and others are doing now. It is bound to widen the gulf—separate schools, separate scholarships, everything separate for Harijans—and you seem to delight in these things. They pain me. The 5 crores of Harijans will now become 10 crores. Some so-called sadhus or sannyasis will become their high-priests and there will come into being a new sect in a century or two hence. You will be regarded as the founder of that sect. Statues will be erected in your memory and it will be said of you that you had separated the Harijans from the Hindus. From the way things are going, it would look as if you were making them feel that they were a class apart. For they fancy that they gain by being separated from the rest of the Hindus. You have made the path of Dr. Ambedkar and Rao Bahadur Srinivasan easy and you have strengthened their hands. They will not be absorbed in Hinduism, but there will be cries of “Long live untouchables”, “Long live Harijans”.
 I have not said all these things thoughtlessly, but what I see happening around me pains me. You have been trapped and if you do not courageously come out of it, you will harm the very cause for which you were prepared to lay down your life. You
 
 “Warning to Me”, 23-4-1933.
 had intended one thing, quite the contrary has happened, let alone getting them considered as part and parcel of Hinduism. You have, instead of saving them, differentiated them by giving them a tempting name. They are not going to be Hindus by such temptation. Selfish and self-seeking preceptors will establish a new religion, a new sect, and you will be their instrument. Today Hindus, Mussalmans and Sikhs are fighting against one another. You will have added one more unit to the fighting forces. They have separate temples and more will be built, and even now different sects are fighting with one another to take possession of these. But the burden of my sorrow is this: All that in your name, with “Mahatma Gandhiki Jai” on their lips! Oh, the pity of it!!
 Thus writes in effect an esteemed friend and fellow-worker. The original is in Gujarati. He is one among the very best of India’s servants. He is spending himself in her service. There is no mistaking the laceration of his heart, but I believe that his affection for me has led him astray and coloured his judgment. If untouchables are not absorbed in the Hindu mass and do not become one with the rest of the Hindus, the responsibility will not lie on my shoulders. It will lie on those of the so-called high-class Hindus who are resisting the absorption. According to them, the so-called untouchable classes have been untouchable from the beginning of time, and will, if they can help it, remain so to the end of time. Some of them have gone so far as to say that they will sacrifice themselves in the attempt to perpetuate this untouchability. What I have done is not merely to unfurl the banner of revolt against the perpetuation of what I hold to be a monstrous wrong, but I am constantly praying that I may  be considered a fit sacrifice for the cause of liberation. I am inviting others to join in the prayer that they might also be deemed worthy to offer themselves as a sacrifice in this sacred cause. If, therefore, untouchability remains, it will do so, not because of what I have done, but in spite of what I have done and am doing. But that will be no new experience. Do we not know that God often upsets the plans of human beings? And it may be that His purpose demands that the so-called high-caste Hindus should harden their hearts, that they should refuse to listen to dictates of reason and justice and that Hinduism should become an extinct religion. For, refusal on the part of high-caste Hindus to regard the Harijans in every sense as equal members with the other Hindus will not now mean perpetuation of untouchability. I
 am quite clear in my mind that untouchability is gone. The untouchables will not remain slaves for ever. Thank God, they are being surely, if slowly, awakened. The pace is daily increasing. There are limits even to the patience of God Almighty. He gives a long rope to untruth and irreligion. But in the end, only Truth remains and nothing else. Hence Hinduism can only live minus untouchability, which is an untruth.
 Whilst, therefore, I am thankful to this true friend for  his  warning voice and whilst I promise that I shall be more and more on the alert, I feel quite sure that the struggle was not begun a moment too soon and that it must go on against all odds,

 April 22, 1933
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I have had no letter from you for three days, that is, after the big packet and that makes me feel a little worried.
 Kaka has heard that Anandi is having fever. Is that true? How is Kusum? I have sent a wire to you in regard to Lakshmibehn. I had a letter here from Narmada. I can’t tell whether anybody will come today. Probably I shall get a letter today. I am writing this before the prayer.
 I worry about you also. I always send you others’ views about you. I do hope that they do not upset you. Anybody who undertakes an important responsibility should expect to be criticized. He will
 benefit by the criticism if he can hear it without being upset, but it would kill him if he takes it to heart. We have in the Ashram a bhajan about “Nindakababa”libtech_786_footnote. I would not say that it is a very good one. That is, the author has not treated the detractor with generosity. But the lesson which it teaches is right. Anyway, whether you are calm or upset, I shall not feel worried if I regularly hear from you. For some time, therefore, you should drop me a postcard every day.
 I have asked for your opinion regarding N. She will arrive there today. Her self-sacrifice seems just now to be as great as her former self-indulgence. On my suggesting to her to-get her hair cut in order to save expense on soap and hair oil, she did so. I have had many such experiences, but I have no time just now to write about them.
 I am enclosing a letter from Kanumurti Ramamurti. He seems to have written to you about something. He wants to join the Ashram and has expressed his desire to see me. Till now I tried to dissuade him, but I will permit him now to come and see me. Meanwhile, if you have had any experience about him, let me know.
 I have received an angry letter from Sitla Sahay. I have had a letter from Prabhudas too. Nothing is certain about his engagement.

 April 22, 1933
 MY DEAR C. R.,
Your letter of 11th April was received by me only yesterday.
Unfortunate, but there it is.
 There is a delicacy about writing on the  fate  of  the  Bills.libtech_791_footnoteI would be prepared to write to the Viceroy and also to the Secretary of State, if you think it worth while, but I do not feel inclined to write about them publicly. It is hardly a dignified spectacle, a prisoner publicly criticizing a Government holding him under its custody. You will observe that I have scrupulously steered clear of any public criticism of the Government and I think that I should retain that detachment.
 I would love to put Narasimhan under Dinshaw Mehta’s care, but I know that you do not believe, as much as I do, if at all, in nature-cure. Kaka is taking that cure at Sinhagad at present and Sinhagad is a very fine secluded sanatorium. It is only a few miles from Poona. If you will not send him to Sinhagad you should send him to the Mysore sanatorium.
 Papa was bound to improve on your reaching there. I have  made my suggestion about her also.
 I make one more suggestion. It is quite likely that the Bjerrumslibtech_792_footnotehave gone to a hill-station. They are very fine people and they will gladly take Papa. Papa knows sufficient English to be able to make herself at home with the Bjerrums. Of course you know that they are stationed at Pudukottah. If you want me to, I would gladly write to them.
Love from us all.
 Yours sincerely,

 I hope you understand why your marriage is taking place at such a time. All will be well if you and Lakshmilibtech_795_footnotehave understood that not enjoyment but self-sacrifice is the aim of marriage. After the marriage both of you should do public service with redoubled zeal, and be more vigilant in doing your duty.

 MORE ABOUT TEMPLE ENTRYlibtech_801_footnote
 There is no doubt whatever that anyone who has no faith in image-worship is not entitled to participate in the movement  for temple entry. No purpose would be served by allowing Harijans a right to have darshanlibtech_802_footnotelibtech_803_footnotefrom the spots you have indicated in the maps. only those restrictions should be applied to Harijans as are applied to the other Hindus. If the public has any objection to it, it would be better not to permit Harijans to enter the temples just now. If the trustees are keen on  performing  shuddhilibtech_804_footnotelibtech_805_footnoteof  the  images,  they  are entitled to do so. Before Harijans enter a temple they should of course be instructed about the general restrictions. In brief, I am clearly of the view that in the matter of temple entry coercion has no place at all. It is improper to force entry of Harijans into a temple where  a  majority of the worshippers are opposed to it. If the worshippers approve of it, Harijans may certainly visit it. In any case, only those Harijans who abide by the rules applied to the general public are entitled to temple entry.
 TRUE MAJORITYlibtech_806_footnote
 
 I had recognized the difficulty about the majority at the very time the Bill was placed before me. I had told Rajaji that 51 per cent would not be proper. I had even suggested an amendment to it, for, I am clearly of the view that the great reform we are trying to bring about cannot become universal so long as there is no clear majority. And all of you would have noticed that for that very reason I have tried to accommodate the sentiments of even a lone opponent. For,
 
 what looks like a superstition to me may be a matter of life and death to him. His temple may be so dear to him that he regards it his all and  it may be his honest belief that the darshan might have no efficacy if he were to have it standing by the side of a Harijan. Hence my suggestion that he may be given a separate time and the temple may undergo shuddhi for his sake.

Hence my suggestion that he may be given a separate time and the temple may undergo shuddhi for his sake.
 I have made this and many other suggestions, but I do not wish to discuss them any more just now. When the Bill comes before the committee, no reformer would hesitate to accept the amendment regarding the strength of majority and any others that deserve to be introduced. Of course, he would not compromise on principles on any account.
 INTER-DINING AND INTER-CASTE MARRIAGESlibtech_808_footnote
 These two measures are not at all related to untouchability.No one is an untouchable in my eyes. But, for that reason, is there any justice in suggesting that I should either sit down for a meal with one whom I do not regard as untouchable or marry my son or daughter to such a one ? Both these things are a matter of personal preference and individual right.But it is not a matter of right to regard any man as un-
 
 touchable because of his birth.That is a gross injustice and heinous sin.
 HARIJANS DON’T CARElibtech_809_footnote
 The question is not what they demand. The point is what we owe to them and what we have promised them in the open conventionlibtech_810_footnotelibtech_811_footnoteof the Hindu world in Bombay held under the presidentship of Malaviyaji. We have made a promise to admit Harijans into temples and Hindus have pledged to lay down their lives to that end, if necessary. Do you remember the statement in Mahabharata?” “Placetruth in one scale and a thousand yajnas in the other. The scale of truth will always be lower.” It is unbearable that we should break our promises to the Harijans and to God. I shudder at the mere thought. We can be patient with the sanatanists, we can plead with them, implore them, but how can we give up the matter of temple entry?
 You say that things would sort themselves out once we educate the Harijans. But then caste Hindus themselves need to be educated as much. Not that there is no education today. But the great misfortune is that it is wrong education that is being given. The wrong education has given us wrong lessons. It teaches us that adharma is dharma, that sanctimoniousness is religion, that superstition is knowledge, that intolerance is kindness, that indulgence is restraint. And that the interpretation of the Shastras consists not in understanding their simple and straightforward meaning but in arbitrarily forcing on them  a far-fetched and perverse meaning. First of all this wrong education will have to be wiped out.
 THE SAME THING OVER AGAINlibtech_812_footnote
 Have you forgotten that at Bombay we made a promise to the Harijans without their asking for it? And what is the sense in saying that Harijans have not demanded? In many places, the poor, downtrodden, crushed Harijans do not ask for schools, they have no
 
 courage to ask for wells; nor do they demand any other rights. And so, does it behove us to say that we will grant them nothing till they ask for it. We have been riding on their shoulders. It would be enough if we got off. These poor creatures have been so oppressed that even if we got off they would not find the burden gone. But is it any justification to continue to ride on them?

556,,WARNING TO ME,"
    
 I  do   not  wish  to  give  the  name  of  the  author  of  thislibtech_813_footnotelibtech_814_footnote.  But everybody knows him. He is one of the sincere servants of the country and has rendered exceptional service to the cause of Harijans. I, therefore, wish that everybody should read this letter carefully. I read it twice over, and pondered over it. The correspondent’s warning is justified, and timely. The fear he has expressed may even prove true.
 If that happens, I will not repent. It will not be the first time that “Man proposes, God disposes” will have been proved true. God, though He ordains everything, takes responsibility for nothing; otherwise I would throw all responsibility on Him and disclaim any for myself. At the most I would accept responsibility only for approving of a suggestion made by an Antyaja friend to substitute the word ‘Antyaja’ by the sweeter one ‘Harijan’. I will not mind if the slogan ‘Jai to Antyajas’ is replaced by ‘Jai to Harijans’.
 The sanatanists assert that the Antyajas have been a distinct class from time immemorial and say that they will sacrifice their lives to keep them so. I have been praying to God, and persuading others also to pray, to grant me the strength to sacrifice my life to secure their assimilation into the Hindu fold and end their separation. The sanatanist friends have been striving to perpetuate the separation of Antyajas and are prepared to accept responsibility for the conse- quences. The question of responsibility, therefore, does not arise.
 
 It would be far better that Harijans should fight savarna Hindus than that they should for ever remain wretched slaves and dependent on savarna Hindus, living on their goodwill and eating their leftovers. Neither Dr. Ambedkar nor Rao Bahadur Srinivasan needs my help to prepare for such a fight. Time has been doing its work. It has brought forth these two friends and will bring forth many more like them, if, that is, savarna Hindus do not do their duty.
 What had been happening before our eyes would not have ceased to happen by our pretending that it was not happening. A snake in the house will not run away by our pretending that it was not there. A disease does not get cured by our ignoring it. I look upon myself as a wise vaid in this matter. My diagnosis is quite correct, and the remedy I have prescribed is also the most appropriate for this particular disease. I have no doubt at all that if it is applied the disease is bound to be cured. What can the vaid do, however, if the patient does not apply the remedy? At the most he may start an indefinite fast at the patient’s residence. Indeed the vaid is getting ready to do so. Only, he must make himself fit to undertake such a fast. The moment he becomes so he will . not be held back by anybody.
 It is not the Harijans who have got the disease; if they have got any, the cause of it is the savarna Hindus. It is the latter who have got the disease. But they deny that they have and threaten the vaid for his diagnosis. But the vaid will not hold his tongue. He has been shouting at the top of his voice, ‘Take care, the house is on fire.’
 What is ordained, however, cannot be prevented. Nobody has been able to do so. If Hinduism is ordained to perish, what can  anybody do? One’s sense of right and wrong is conditioned by one’s past karmas. And past karmas mean the future. savarna Hindus will he prompted to do what is in keeping with the future that is ordained for them. How can one, therefore, blame them either?
 I would, therefore, suggest to this servant of the country that he should not lose patience, nor his appetite or sleep, but should go on doing his duty with single-minded devotion. He will probably say, and rightly, that he felt it was his duty to warn me and that having discharged it, he felt relieved. In that case there is no need for me to console him. He has done well indeed to warn me I will be and remain more vigilant. As to my path, I see it clear before me and will take care not to stray from it. My aim is the same as that of this servant of the country. Like him, I, too, do not want the Harijans to become a
 separate sect. I do not wish even in my dreams to be the Acharya of such a new sect. I wish to become and die as a true servant of the Hindus and, therefore, of the Harijans, of India and, therefore, of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis, Christians, Jews and all others.
 The warning, however, given by this servant of the country is as much for the sanatanists as it is for me. Will they heed it?

557,,HARIJAN SCHOOLS IN KATHIAWAR,"
    
 Shri Mulchand Parekh, secretary of Kathiawar Harijan Committee, had suggested to me  that  I  should  write  something  about Harijan schools, etc., in the Harijanbandhu.  Thereupon  I  asked for a report of their activities. He has sent the following reportlibtech_815_footnotelibtech_816_footnote:
 I have already expressed my opinion. Not a single one of those schools and ashrams which already exist should close down for want of funds. If there are only a handful of workers, they should sell their property and sell themselves even to keep the institutions going. If there are such financial difficulties, they indicate that the people of Kathiawar have no interest in Harijan welfare or they do not trust the workers. Whatever the truth, the only way to create such interest or trust is the workers self-sacrifice.
 I hear sugestions of collecting funds from outside Kathiawar, from a place as far off as Africa. It is shameful if we have to do that. Those Kathiawaris who reside abroad should keep themselves informed of such philanthropic organizations and they should send contributions without being asked. Organizations like Kathiawar Harijan Samiti can easily subsist if every rich Kathiawari puts aside 10 per cent or whatever portion of his earnings he thinks proper for rendering such help.
The proper thing is that the local Kathiawaris should take
 
 
 interest in such organizations and identify themselves with them. It is really shameful on our part to have to trouble an old man like Abbas Saheb to help us collect funds. I, therefore, hope that after reading Shri Mulchand Parekh’s statement people will send their donations unasked and ensure the survival of the organizations.

 Harijanbandhu, 23-4-1933
 "
558,,COMPLAINT AGAINST WOMEN,"
    
 I give below the gist of what a Harijan from Karachi has written to me, retaining his broken language as far as possible:
 The sense of pollution through touch is much stronger among women. More so against the Dhed Harijans. They throw down to them stale, dirty, rotten left-over food. The women believe that only stale and rotten food should be given to the Bhangis. They are convinced that this is proper. The Bhangi men and women as a matter of course believe that they are getting their morning meal in return for their scavenging work. If they Hindu society stops giving rotten food to the Bhangi and the other communities, I can humbly say that pollution will disappear from the women. Youwill have to plead further with women to shed the superstitious notion of pollution through touch.
 I have given the above as the substance of along letter. Untouchability will not be eradicated merely by women giving good food to the Harijan brethren instead of left-overs, but if they did that, certainly it would be said that they women had some compassion in their hearts. The complaint against women is a genuine one. If they wish, they can forthwith effect this reform. This does not involve a question of money but only a change of heart. The woman in whose heart God dwells can readily accept a harijan as a fellow-being. The students of Dehra Dun had raised the same question and what I wrotelibtech_817_footnotein reply to it applies here also. By controlling their palate, the women can give a clean share of food to the Harijans without adding to the expense by a single pie. I have a childhood memory. Many times my mother ate after feeding a sadhu. She would serve out lovingly what shee herself was to eat and having fed him thus she would take here
 
 meal and feel rewarded. Similarly, how nice it would be if women took out the share for the Harijans first and then served the other! In this case, a Harijans ceases to be a beggar but becomes a family member or a guest. She would feed him lovingly and merely  by doing this she would make that Harijan clean. Instead of proudly throwing food from upstairs, she would hand over the food herself to the Bhangi and, if she found his hands dirty, she would ask him to clean them. If he does not have clean clothes, she would provide them. She would buy utensils for him or would given him only dry and un- cooked food or would increase his wages. When a Bhangi develops self-respect he will, others, accept payment only. Before such a time comes, I have suggested only interim reforms. Many reforms will occur to women themselves when they have had a change of heart, when the ghost of untouchability has been exorcized and when the feeling that Harijans are inferior is removed. Without waiting for anyone to take up this work on a large scale, a woman who feels the need for this reform should make a beginning with herself and then invite her neighbours to join her.

  	Your letter of 18th April. It is utterly unworthy of belief. N.libtech_820_footnotelibtech_821_footnotewas 	with me when I read your letter and I asked her whether in  her  	opinion when she was playing with fire you were untouched by it and 	she said point blank ‘No’.

This is impossible for any person who is not 	utterly impotent or who is not a God, and I suppose that you are 	neither the one nor the other.

What correction would you send me now about your wire?libtech_822_footnoteI think the thing is all forgotten, and for the sake 	of truth what is now necessary is not a correction which is 	unwanted, but mental alertness which will not be satisfied with 	unsifted facts or loose arguments or      
 expressions based upon those facts. It is not possible for me to prove with perfect logic that the extent of untouchability in Madras is much greater than in Bengal. But for our purpose, i.e., for the reformer who wants to get at the root of the evil and to serve only truth, it is a completely proved proposition that untouchability is by far the  greatest in the South, because there it is not the caste Hindus on the one side and untouchables on the other, but Brahmins on the one side and non-Brahmins on the other. Non-Brahmins include all Hindus and all the non-Brahmins are undoubtedly untouchables, not perhaps in accordance with the definition of the Franchise Committee or the Census Commissioner, but most decidedly according to  our definition. There is untouchability as to water, as to food and as to temple-going between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. But there are grades of untouchability, the bottom list containing the unseeable, who not only must not be seen but whose voice even must not be heard by the Brahmins. The temples are not arranged in the South as in the North. There, there are barriers for all the divisions. I do not even know the actual barriers created, but there they are, and what you and I want to remove is those barriers. I am just now to go through the illuminating chapter on untouchability in the Bengal Census Report, but you see now my point. No correction that you may make will answer the purpose, but let us understand the position thoroughly for ourselves and I would just now suggest to you: ‘Dismiss the South from you mind altogether. Don’t go by the  mental  state,  then perhaps the comparatively more sensitive namasudra feels the comparatively lighter untouchability much more than the compara- tively less sensitive unseeable feels the grossest form of untoucha- bility. Therefore irrespective of what the South does or does not do, your own work is cut out for you. you have to get rid of the untouchability of Bengal, whether it affect 50 per cent of the Hindu population or 5 per cent.
 I understand what you say about Dr. P. C. Ray and Gurudev.libtech_823_footnoteI think that the more you study the situation the more you will find, as I have found already, that educated Bengal does want a revision of the
 
 Yeravda Pactlibtech_824_footnotelibtech_825_footnoteand so far as I am concerned it may have that revision if it can conciliate the Bengal Harijans and all  the  other  parties interested, provided of course that there is no tampering with the joint system. that they are going about it the wrong way is true and unfortunate. It is equally unfortunate that non-Bengalis are being blamed for what happened. Bengalis should have come in their numbers to the meeting in Bombay. There is a very fine legal maxim in Latin which says: ‘Equity serves the vigilant, not the dormant.’ But you cannot say anything to a person who is oppressed with grievances and is angry. Therefore I have adopted complete silence. That by itself will produce a reasonable spirit, and I would advise you too to observe absolute silence. You have said enough and you have given your word to the Harijans of Bengal that so far as you are concerned the Pact is a sacred thing, not to be altered without the unanimous consent of all parties. Have I made myself quite clear to you?
 I see that you are now having a proper ebb in the circulation of Harijan. But I do hope that you will not have to run it at a loss, and it comes to the losing point, you will stop publication. If bengal does not want ‘Bengali Harijan’, we may not force it upon it. The circulation of Hindi, Gujarati and English editions is steadily increasing. The English has been self-supporting almost from the beginning, and it is expected that the Gujarati and the Hindi will be, perhaps, inside of a month. Did I tell you that there was also a Tamil edition published by Ganesan? He is a very energetic worker and had given himself entirely to such causes.

 April 23, 1933
 DEAR RUDRAMUNI,
 I thank you for you letter. It is because you belong to the priesthood of the Harijan community that I have flet so sore about you. I cannot help feeling that you have neglected N. You should not have taken here there. You did nothing in the shape of putting her to the work for which you took her to you village and, if N. is right in what she says, you would not condescend to do any physical work. How I wish you would be an ideal priest to the Harijan and labour with them and for them, avoiding all the weaknesses and vices of the caste Hindu priests! How I wish you, by the strength of you character and learning, command respect from the most fastidious caste Hindus!
 So far as I can understand, you never refunded to Ramachandra the money for the ticket that you should have purchased for N. but for which you were too late. And then N. tells me that you resented here cropping her hair. Surely, it was a matter for you to welcome when a sister who had but till yesterday been leading an unclean life suddenly resolves to throw off all uncleanliness and adopt a life of renunciation, apart from the economic and the hygienic necessity of removing the hair. Do you not understand, as a Hindu, that as a sannyasini, which according to our notion she had become, she cannot keep hair or any ornamentation that would tempt base human nature?
 Lastly, you have not told me that the ticket for her to come to Poona was kindly paid for by a Parsi gentleman. Please let me have his full name and address. You will understand that I have not written this letter to rebuke you. I have no right to do so. I have not known you except through N. But because I consider you to be one of my own and because I feel for you I have written this in the hope that it may serve as a warning for the future. If I have unconsciously done an injustice to you, you will please correct me.
 Yours sincerely,

          MY 	DEAR RAMACHANDRA,    April 	23, 1933 
  	I have your letter with N.’s letter. She and your letter came by 	the same mail.  So  you  see  that  I  anticipated  you.libtech_826_footnotewas  anxiously watching her progress at Chitaldrug 	and I saw that having been instrumental in the sudden revolution in 	her life it would have been sinful on my part to have allowed her to 	pine away in Chitaldrug without the Harijans benefiting by her 	presence. I have therefore no alternative but to have her directly 	under my care. I know that the experiment is not free from danger. I 	do not know, I suppose she herself does not know, whether the 	revolution has come to stay in her life. The break with the past is 	too sudden and yet I have known people to undergo such apparently 	sudden transformation. Looking back upon her letters I can trace the 	invisible working of her mind and the unconscious war between the 	forces of evil and forces of good that was going on within her. Let 	us hope that the forces of good have triumphed over those of evil.  	Please tell me if you are out of pocket on her behalf and if so let 	me have your account. Did Rudramuni ever refund the money you paid 	for her ticket to Chitaldrug?

  	You should write to me about your experiences in the villages. Mix 	with the village people as if you are one of them and talk to them 	in their own way. You can ask them what work they do, what food    
 they eat, what crops they grow, what manures they use, where they have their pit-latrines and whether they use them, how many heads of cattle they tend and in what condition the cattle are, whether they have any fruit trees or other trees, what facilities they have for water, and so on. You may speak to the village children and mix with them. In short, we should take interest in their lives as if they were our relations and inquire after their conditions with the same curiosity with which we do about our relations,. This is the way to cultivate and strengthen the feeling of oneness with people.
I hope you enjoy excellent health.

          CHI. 	PREMA,       April 	23, 1933 
  	The right hand is sufficiently tired. I, therefore, wish to preserve 	all my strength for writing articles for Harijan. I don’t 	think it will require complete rest.  	I wrote one letterlibtech_827_footnoteto 	you a few days ago. This letter, therefore, can be brief. I 	will inquire about books for parachure Shastri.  	Maitri will give you trouble. If she is at all likely to improve, 	she will do so only if we tolerate her and treat her with love. She 	should not feel the absence of her mother. Women may be exempted 	during their monthly periods from rules of work as may be thought  	necessary. If some or most of them abuse this freedom, the Ashram 	will not be responsible for that. If somebody misuses the time set 	apart for sleep, we cannot reduce that period on that account.  	Do not lose you patience. You must always remember that a reformer a 	servant of the people can do no useful work unless he or she is 	patient. Let this be written in bold letters on you wall; inscribe 	it in an amulet and wear it on you arm.  	If she receives permission from the Ashram, N. will come there in a 	very few day. She has openly led an immoral life, borrowed money and 	told lies. But now she has become almost a nun. I have not felt any 	insincerity in this. After she had realized her errors, she has done 	whatever I advised her to do. If she is likely to  get  an 	opportunity to adhere to here praise-worthy resolution, it is only 	in the Ashram that she will do. Anywhere else, she will either 	wither away or relapse into here old ways. she has great ability and 	wide knowledge. She has read the Mahabharata. If she come 	there, cultivate here acquaintance and introduce her to other women. 	Don’t ask here anything about her past. She herself will be ready 	to talk about it, but it would be undesirable to talk about it or 	make her talk about it. It is harmful to recall memories of sinful 	pleasures. if she takes interest in talking about her immoral past, 	you mayconclude that she is still not free from such desires. Regard 	her as you your younger    
 sister and point out her faults to her with love. You can ask me whatever you like about her past life. I have written all this today because I may not get time to write much later when she is asked to go there. Her son is a fine boy.

569,"April 23, 1933","INTERVIEW TO ASSOCIATED
PRESS OF INDIAlibtech_833_footnote","
    
 April 23, 1933
 Dr. Ambedkarlibtech_834_footnotehaving received several communications  from Harijan friends as to the desirability of altering the panel system in the Poona   Pactlibtech_835_footnotecame   to   sound   my   views  about   the   proposal.   The substitute suggested is that only those Harijan candidates should be declared elected who succeed in getting a fixed minimum of the votes of Harijans from among the joint electorates. Not having ever applied my mind to this formula, I was unable to give him any answer. I simply told him that he should first see the different Harijan Associations and others interested, and then let me know their views. He asked me, however, to consider the proposal independently, and write to him at London my opinion which I shall try to do.libtech_836_footnote
 Asked why Dr. Ambedkar wanted a change, Mr. Gandhi replied that Dr. Ambedkar stated that so far as he was concerned he was quite satisfied with the panel system, and he would not go back on the Poona Pact. But pressure was being brought to bear upon him for securing the above change.
 
 Asked for his views on the panel system, Mr. Gandhi said:
 Personally, my opinion is that the panel system is perfectly harmless so long as Harijans do not distrust caste Hindus.
 Will you be prepared to accept the alteration if the others also agree?
 I would not easily accept the change. I have not yet considered it. Because everybody agrees, it does not follow that I should accept it.  I would examine every such proposal solely from the Harijan point of view, because it never crossed my mind that there can ever be a con- flict of interest between the Harijans and the caste Hindus. My con- firmed opinion is that whatever is in the real interest of the Harijans must necessarily be in the interest of the caste Hindus. As I believe I have the capacity of examining such questions from the Harijan point of view, I should not mind standing alone, and defending my position if unfortunately things came to such a pass that, for my opinion, I could not secure a single supporter.

 If you have copies of the Ashram rules, send a copy each in whatever languages you have them. If you remember the circums- tances in which Godavari and Pandurang Choudhari had to levave, let me know. Prema is likely to know more about Godavari.
 During a discussion among us about N., Chhaganlallibtech_839_footnoteexpressed a view against her being admitted. I, therefore, asked him to write
 
 
 down his view and also to say what precautions should be taken if she was admitted. I have just read his note after finishing the other letters. If you decide to take her in, we cannot put on her the restrictions which Chhaganlal suggests. They will not be for her good or that of the Ashram. We must utilize her abilities in whatever way we can, conforming to Ashram discipline. We. should not send a new entrant outside the Ashram for work, But I would certainly put  Hrijan  children in her hands. We should admit her, assuming that she has turned a new leaf in her life, otherwise we ought not to take her in at all. But I should like to explain this point at greater length. if you consent is received, I will certainly send all necessary instructions. It will be enough for the present if you understand that she is not to be admitted as a sinner.

CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got your letter. I can see-from your language that you are unhappy. I am sure your replieslibtech_846_footnoteare not addressed to me, for I did not want them. I assume that they are addressed to Chhaganlal.
 My view about your honesty and your efficiency has not changed. When it changes, I shall not be able to protect you. You should not feel concerned till it changes. I have found your reply to Chhaganlal’s complaint convincing; but I feel hidden anger in your language. There is no reason at all for you to be angry. Chhaganlal wrote down what he thought. There was no malice in it, but only his inability to see the truth. You will be able to see this inability in his letter about N. He can have no reason for malice towards her, but he was frightened by her immoral life in the past, could not overcome that fear and so thought as he did. His deficiency, therefore, is of the intellect and not of the heart. However that may be, you should learn to adopt a calm attitude towards such criticism and accept whatever may be worth accepting in it. Such strength cannot be acquired in a day. It will be enough if you keep on trying.
   [PS.]  BAPU   Whether 	or not it is improper for Prema or other girls to walk 
  	with their arms round each other’s neck, I cannot say unless I see 	myself what they do. If their behaviour is immodest, it is of course 	improper, but there can be no harm if it is within limits of 	modesty. I have discussed this point in my letter to Lakshmidas. 	Read that letter if you have not done so. If, after reading it, you 	wish to ask further questions, you may.  	I may have to burden you with one more guest. You know Margarete 	Spiegel who stayed in the Ashram for some time and worked among 	Harijans. She will probably  land in Bombay tomorrow. Will you let 	her stay in the Ashram? I need  not say anything about her. She is a 	very good woman. She has been writing    
 to me here.
 If the sum of Rs. 2,5000 has been received from Soniramji, send it to Ghanshyamdas. Add five . more to  the  25  spinning-wheels [which I have asked you to send]. We shall get Rs. 1_ for each.

She must therefore give herself as much rest as 	she can both to body and mind, and as a quack doctor I suggest to 	her that she must eat sparingly restricting herself as much as it is 	possible to milk and fruit of which there is so much to be had. She 	may take salad vegetables but she does not need them. If she carries 	out these very simple instructions to the letter she will find that 	she will derive the greatest benefit from the change. She must not 	at present think of writing her book. She may write it when she has 	completely recovered her vitality and lost the haggard pensive look 	that she had about her when I met her. I must not omit to add that 	she ought not to take those two poisons, tealibtech_854_footnoteand coffee,  so  bad  for  nerves.  I  suggest  a 	home-made substitute, hot water, Kashmir honey and a few drops of 	lemon. She will find this to be a complete, effective substitute for 	milk or coffee or cocoa.  	I suggest a novel recreation for both of you. In going about for 	your walks, make a search for all the Harijans you can find and add 	to your knowledge of Hindi by trying to make yourselves understood 	by them and in understanding them. And do not forget the 	prescription for avoiding cold. Keep yourselves moving as much as 	possible in the open air. Mahadev 	had your letter. We are all doing well and send love to

  	I very much liked the letter you wrote to me. Whenever we see a 	wrong being done, one may caution and restrain the husband, the 	father and even the king. If the person does not listen to one 	immediately, one may repeat the caution again and again. But this is 	for the future.  	I do not believe that girls who are kept under strict restraint do 	not feel passion. On the contrary they lose all self-control and 	when the parents learn the fact they too cover it up. We should try 	to discover the middle way. We should give freedom to boys and girls 	and also teach them self-restraint. Do uncovered heads arouse 	passion where it is not the custom to cover the head? What do you 	think happens in the Madras Presidency where the girls wear their 	hair loose? The seat of the passions is not outside oneself, but 	inside—in one’s eyes. The impure eye will see impurity 	everywhere.  	Nevertheless, it is the duty of the senior women to sit together and 	think about the problem of the girls and draw up instructions for 	them, which should then be put before the girls and even before the 	men. I have stated above my own point of view so that all of you may 	think about the problem. I should like you to call a meeting of all 	the women and discuss it. Will you take the initiative? I 	have written to Purushottam asking him not to go to Rajkot.  	He should stay on for your sake at least.

590,"April 	26, 1933",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
         April 	26, 1933   CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	You   must   have   received   the   letterlibtech_859_footnotewhich   I   wrote   to   you yesterday. I forgot 	to enclose in it a newspaper cutting to be shown to Dr. Sharma. I 	send it with this letter. These days I have to write with the left 	hand and so could not write yesterday all that I wished to. I hope 	to do so today. I felt that it would be better if Chhaganlal replied 	to your comments on his criticisms of you, and so pressed him to do 	that. Accordingly, he has given me his reply. After careful thinking 	I felt that I ought to send it to you, and am doing so. I don’t 	think it proves the necessity of your reforming your method of work 	in any respect, but I do see in his note his honesty of purpose. I 	have never felt any malice in him. But he is suspicious by nature 	and cannot easily put a straightforward interpretation on things. He 	does not readily see the virtues of the other party, and magnifies 	the defects. This gives an impression to other people that he lacks 	generosity of heart. He does not wish to be ungenerous nor is he 	ungenerous by nature. But people who do not understand him can 	easily see ungenerosity in him. If I have succeeded in convincing 	you of this, the anger and intolerance which are present in your 	reply would not be there. Your charge that some inmates of the 	Ashram realized the necessity of better educational facilities for 	children after they themselves had children, is unworthy of you. And 	it is not true, either. It is utterly wrong to believe that 	Narahari, Chhaganlal and others who subscribe to this criticism are 	as selfish as that. They also are loyal inmates of the Ashram and 	are good men. They a]so care for the good of the Ashram as much as 	we do. They may be—they are—less efficient, but you ought not to 	be conscious in the slightest degree of    
 your greater efficiency or be proud of it. Even a mention of somebody else’s inefficiency is an indirect form of self-praise. I want you to avoid even that, And suppose that children are born to inmates of the Ashram and some new ideas occur to the parents when the children grow up a little, we should not detect in that their selfishness as parents. This thing is part of human nature and criticism of it is not just. All that we should expect from people is this. one should desire for others, children what one desires for one’s own and should make no distinction between one’s children and other’s children  under one’s charge. We may say that in the measure that this attitude is absent in the Ashram we are imperfect. However, no inmate of the Ashram should say that the shortcomings are those of others and not his. It is as difficult to know one’s shortcomings fully as it is to attain self-realization. And I believe that for a person who can see his shortcomings fully and who ceaselessly strives to overcome them to the best of his ability, self-realization is no difficult task. I, therefore, certainly desire that, if you fed that it was improper for you to make such a statement and that it cannot be proved, you should withdraw it and apologize to your co-workers. However, I don’t want you to withdraw it only to please me if you yourself are not convinced of its impropriety. If you sincerely believe that the reason why people make this criticism against you is that they have children now, let your charge remain till in course of time you learn from experience that it is not true. In the Ashram nobody should be asked to apologize merely for the sake of form. Such apology would benefit no one. For us apology can have only one meaning; namely, that it is sincere admission of one’s error. All of us must tolerate the charges which our co-workers-make against us. I don’t ask those who make charges against you to apologize to you, because they sincerely believe what they say. I can advise them to apologize only when I can change their belief. The same rule applies to you.
 Chhaganlal’s second objection is against your criticism of him for occasionally requiring food to be sent to his room. Maybe when he had a guest he found it necessary to ask for a thali for him in his room. I see nothing wrong in that. If a guest turna up unexpectedly, what else can a person who does not cook in his own house do ? And if a guest has turned up just at mealtime, I can understand that one might not like to bring him to the common kitchen, for it might be possible to talk to him only during the meal. I do not know whether or not Chhaganlal had these legitimate reasons, but I do not expect
 criticism for such things from you. Need there be any limit to generosity ? Our ideal examples of generosity are king Bali, Yudhishthira and others like them. The former  lost  his  whole kingdom through his generosity and Yudhishthira stopped the blood from flowing out of his wound in order to save king Virat from Arjuna’s wrath and, before the latter arrived, got it all cleaned by Draupadi and waited as if nothing had happened. our aspiration is that we should be able to do easily in this age all that they could do in ancient times.
 I did not read any complaint on your part in your references to Purushottamlibtech_860_footnoteand Kanulibtech_861_footnotelibtech_862_footnote, but saw in them only an acknowledgment that things could not be otherwise in the Ashram. Mahadev, on the other hand, supports Chhaganlal’s interpretation and says that you nurse a grievance about Purushottam and Kanu having remained without a knowledge of history, geography, etc. Whether it is that or whether it is an acknowledgment on your part of what is inevitable in the Ashram, your own interpretation should be accepted as the only right one. Let me, therefore, know what the truth is. My own view is that we should not regret any boy having not learnt what passes today as history and geography. on the contrary, I believe that the boys could, not have acquired anywhere else what they have in the Ashram. Moreover, they have learnt history and geography, too, of the kind to which we attach value. I do feel unhappy, but not by way of complaint against anybody. I feel unhappy about the interpretation of the Ashram itself. I know that we have not been able to give the children all that we were eager to give them. Isn’t that my own shortcoming? That people do not regard it as such is another matter. But when we try to draw up a balance-sheet and examine the credit and the debit columns, a shortcoming must be recognized as a shortcoming. The Ashram has grown according to the capacities of the persons whom I could attract and the ideas which I could implement. I can enumerate no end of shortcomings to be found in the Ashram. And still I love it, for it is chiefly my handiwork. If I had greater ability and the circumstances had been more favourable, the Ashram would be  a more attractive place and there would have been no ground for the criticism which it deserves in some respects. My purpose, however, in stating all this is to persuade you not to see the shortcomings of others
 
 and not to criticize people who might criticize you, only to point out the error in their criticism and accept whatever is acceptable in it and act upon it. This will save you from many problems.
 And now a few words about Chhaganlal’s note. Like his previous note, I didn’t like this one either. If I wish, Chhaganlal would readily amend it. But in that case you would not be able to know what he really thinks. What is necessary is that you and I should love him despite our knowledge of what he thinks. If we fail to do that, we cannot prove that the Ashram is a large family. And, moreover, if we cut ourselves off from everybody, one after another, for small defects, we would be left alone in the world. Nobody except God can afford that. This is why I have often stated that one should forget oneself completely and become a cypher. Nothing can equal the joy of that state. As for Chhaganlal’s note, I see an error in almost every sentence of it,
 Chhaganlal’s language is offensive and betrays his thoughtlessness and intolerance. Leaving aside your anger and your charges, he has not been able to see at all the effectiveness of your reply. Even in regard to points on which you have given a convincing reply, he has again offered advice.
 In writing about Chhaganlal, I have been completely frank. I know that there was no need to advise you. I have explained this to him. I had also let him read what I wrote to you; even then he has written what he has. If I did not know him, his remarks would have seemed utterly mean to me too. But I should like even you not to see meanness in them but only his lack of intelligence. I am sending such a note to you hoping that you will be able to ignore even  such criticism like that with a generous heart. I believe that since I am forwarding the note to you, you are completely safe and so is Chhaganlal. It is a great good fortune of the Ashram that we are trying to tell, without any fear; even the unpleasant thoughts which we think about one another.
 I will now end this letter. It is I who am loading heavier burdens on you. I don’t hesitate to put before you even criticism in which I do not believe and, by doing so, I waste your, and therefore  the  Ashram’s, time. But I think it was absolutey necessary to do this. But now it is enough. You need not at all reply to the accompanying note. If you understand the few point: which I have tried to explain to you, you may write a line or two accordingly. This letter, too, contains
 some good ideas. Do therefore, show it to others but don’t think that it is necessary for you to discuss any point with anybody. Keep on trying to do the best you can. As desired by you, I am also returning your letter.

      CHI. 	MANI,  April 	26, 1933 
  	I got your letter only two or three days ago. Your letters, no 	matter how long, will never be too long for us. If, however, you 	expect Father or me to write very long letters, we cannot satisfy 	you. But I can understand your desire for such letters. We enjoy 	quite a number of amenities and even luxuries to which you in 	Belgaum are perfect strangers. But we would prove ourselves unworthy 	servants of the nation and unworthy parents if we used them or asked 	them for any but public purposes. Nobody would think well of a 	person who claims to be a father of hundreds of children and lets 	his mind soar in the clouds. So, then, we enjoy all these luxuries 	to the full and you or Mridula may envy our good fortune as much as 	you like. You had already passed a sarcastic remark in regard to 	Mirabehn, and have withdrawn it also. What is a father’s duty? 	Should he give his children 
 what each needs, or should he give the same to all and thus not only do great injustice but, maybe, make himself responsible for the death of one of the children through his attempt to prove himself just in the eyes of the world or to his immature child? If, suppose, you are suffering from a disease and have to be given bajra bread and skimmed buttermilk, does that  mean  that  a  girl  like  Bharatilibtech_863_footnotelibtech_864_footnote,  who would require to be nourished on butter, honey and light chapatis, should be given the same food as you? A father is bound to provide al! that is necessary for a child’s welfare. He is free to indulge the child and give it more in so far as it is consistent with such welfare, but is not bound to do so. It should not be necessary to explain this to you after all these years. But I have to produce a long letter somehow, and so am indulging in all this philosophizing. If you were not at all angry with us, why were you making yourself miserable? Why did you show such lack of faith? Why didn’t you rest assured that one of us must have written to you? I agree that both should write if possible. But no one would be eager to write if he found that L the fate of his letters was so uncertain. One letter [a week] is regularly sent to you, and, you may rest assured, will continue to be sent in the hope that you will somehow get at least one. Father has undertaken to give a detailed reply to your letter. He will, therefore, give you the replies to your messages, and also give the replies to your queries in detail. I should certainly like to reply to some of them myself, but I resist the temptation. Anandi’s operation is an old story now. She left for the Ashram long ago and she is quite well there. She got cold and fever some time ago, but that was only for a few days.      libtech_865_footnotelibtech_866_footnotecame and saw us,
 . . . ’s hands are swollen and looked like pillars.       is taking tender
 care of her. He is a husband, a friend, a teacher and a servant in one. At present at any rate it seems that even her Creator could not have found a better husband for her. Whether       deserves him or not, God
 alone knows. But I  myself had pointed out her weaknesses to  .  .  .

But, trained under . . ., how would . . . go back on his decision? Everyone had showered love on her at the time of her marriage. Everyone gave her some present or the other. They will not have to spend for quite a  long time anything on household requirements  or
 
 clothes. Be contented with this. Our warder is standing before me ready to take me back to my ward. It will soon be eleven and so I am returning to my cage. After I have bathed and lunched’ I shall be brought back to the Harijan ward at twelve.libtech_867_footnote

593,"April 27, 1933",THE YERAVDA PACT,"
    
 [April 27, 1933]libtech_868_footnote
 Though an agitation has been going on in Bengal for some time for securing a revision of the Yeravda Pact, I have not felt called upon to take part in the discussion, if only not to embarrass the Bengal friends. The Pact is safe so long as even one party interested in it opposes any change. At the same time, any opposition for the sake of it would be foolish, if it could be demonstrated that  a  particular change was necessary. I do not pretend to understand the local situation in Bengal. Therefore, I felt that it would be presumptuous on my part to take part in the Bengal controversy, till  it  became absolutely necessary for me to do so and till all the material required for forming a judgment upon it was before me. But I assured the Harijan friends who referred to me for my opinion that I would not do anything without consultation with them and that I had till now seen nothing to alter my view.
 Generally I have a]ways held the opinion that, when the principle of reservation is accepted, not imposed, the party in whose interest the reservation is accepted should determine the quantum. In the case of Harijans, I have felt further that they could not have too many seats reserved for them, especially if the criterion were not mere untouchability but backwardness. Indeed, if I could have my way, I would throw open the list of untouchable voters to all backward
 
 classes under one generic name and permit every Hindu who chose to come under that list. That would at once correct the atmosphere, and untouchability will be banished at least from politics. To this perhaps the sanatanists, too, would have no objection. They have never, so far as I am aware, demurred to the representation of Harijans in the legislatures and they can have no objection to anyone classifying himself as a Harijan. But all this is merely by way of introduction to what I want to say.
 Dr. Ambedkar’s sudden visit to me has rendered it necessary for me to discuss the Pact. At the pressure and invitation of his friends, he suggestedlibtech_869_footnotethat the panel system provided in the Yeravda Pact should be altered to a single election by the joint electorate providing that the Harijan candidate should secure a fixed minimum of Harijan votes. I was not prepared to give any opinion during the Doctor’s visit. I had not applied my mind to the question at all. Moreover, I suggested that he should first secure the opinion of different schools of thought among Harijans and of caste Hindus interested in the question and then ask me for my opinion. He said he would do that, but he made me promise that I should consider his proposal independently and give my opinion on it. The matter being too important for a private discussion, I propose to fulfil my promise by publicly stating my opinion.
 The new proposal seems to me to be in no way to the advantage of Harijans. The only objection to the panel system I have heard is that it is costly. This presupposes that there would be a contest almost in every case for coming into the panel. It would have been so if the panel was confined to only two, instead of four, candidates. Selection of four candidates for contesting each seat would make it unnecessary in most cases to have the primary election. Except where Harijan parties are many and are sharply divided, there cannot be more than four candidates for one seat. Indeed, for some time to come it will be difficult even to have candidates enough to fill all the reserved seats and, in the majority of cases, there will be no contests whatsoever. It would be up to Harijan associations not to have bitter rivalries at the very threshold of their political career and it will be the duty of caste Hindus not to foment divisions in the Harijan ranks. I am hoping that the interests of Harijans and other Hindus will never clash. But should they do so, the panel system amply provides for the selection in the
 
 first instance of the right kind of the Harijan candidate—right, I mean, from the purely Harijan point of view. And yet so long as there is no bitter strife among Harijans themselves, there never need be any primary election, or, for that matter, even a joint final election.
 But the alternative seems to be fraught with grave danger. As the very first choice will be general, unscrupulous political parties will put their own Harijan candidates and create divisions among the Harijan ranks with the greatest ease and demoralize the candidates and the Harijan electorate. So far as I can see and so long as the system of reservation prevails, the panel system is the best adopted for securing the selection only of those candidates who in the Harijan opinion are best fitted to serve their special interests. Whereas I can see nothing but seeds of strife and bitterness in the alternative proposal.
 Though I have written decisively, I am open to reason. The argument of expense makes no appeal to me. I hope I have shown that, if anything, the panel system is calculated to avoid all needless expense. I was amazed, however, to see an interview in the Press in which Dr. Ambedkar is reported to have said his proposal made no alteration whatsoever in the substance of the Pact. I venture to dicer from this view. Whereas the panel system gives an opportunity to the caste Hindus to have some say in the election of Harijan candidates, Dr. Ambedkar’s alternative may well deprive the caste Hindus of any say whatsoever in the election of Harijan candidates and thus create an effectual bar between caste Hindus and Harijan Hindus. It was just to prevent that calamity that I put forth all the force that I could command, and looking back upon the past, I do not regret having done so. I put my difficulty very mildly before Dr. Ambedkar at the Sunday interview. As I think over the difficulty, it appears to me to be insurmountable, and it is this: The candidate who gets the minimum of Harijan votes provided under the alternative need never have a single vote from the caste voters, for any Harijan candidate getting just the number of Harijan votes required under the proposal will defeat his rival even though he may otherwise top the whole of the list of candidates, Harijan and non-Harijan, if he gets just one vote less than the minimum required from the Harijans. This would ,amount to an utter negation of the Yeravda Pact.
 It is open to Dr. Ambedkar, as it is to the Bengal friends and any other person, to say that the Yeravda Pact was arrived at under the coercion of the fast. I have no sense of shame about it. If they  accepted the Pact in order to save my life, surely, they had their
 consideration, and it comes with ill-grace from them now to repudiate a completed bargain. The use they can make of their mistake, if such it was, is never to repeat it and not to swerve from the path of duty for fear of sacrificing the life of a person, however dear that life may be. I had staked my life not to coerce anybody to do what  to  them  appeared to be wrong. I had staked it for achieving a purpose which I thought was altogether noble. The way to approach the question, therefore, is not to bring in the fast in the controversy but in cold blood to show to the public that the Pact is inherently bad, either on moral or public grounds. It will be time enough to seriously examine the question of reopening the Pact when such a case is satisfactorily made out in the first instance.

You will find herewith so Dr. Saunders’slibtech_872_footnoteletter. It is satisfactory on the whole. Letter 	for Ba will also accompany this.     	“Letter 	to D. B. Kalelkar”, 27-4-1933.  
 You may pursue the conduct of the Ashram as much as you like. It won’t tire me. It will assist me. It will enable you to understand my viewpoint better. You must not accuse yourself of want of faith in me or my wisdom because you do not see a point of mine at once or because having seen it you cannot agree with me. I am not a perfect being. Why should you see eye to eye with me in my errors? That would be blind faith. Your faith in me should enable you to detect my true error much quicker than a fault-finder. What I would like your faith to do is that when you cannot convince me of my error you should think that it is likely that I see more clearly than you do in matters where I have thought and experienced more. That would give you peace of mind. Therefore you should not paralyse your thought by suppressing your doubts and torturing yourself that you do not agree with my view in particular things. You should therefore pursue the discussion of the Ashram till you have the clearest possible grasp of all my ideas about it.
 You need not have argued about the man being the worse sinner of the two. I have always held that view against most, if not all, of my male friends who have expressed their opinion on the point. of course  I agree with you also that man’s superiority, if it is that, over the brute creation, consists in his capacity for observing brahmacharya. It must therefore be an Ashram ideal to be attained immediately if that were possible.
 There is therefore complete agreement. between us so far as the fundamental thing is concerned. The difficulty or the difference comes in when we begin to devise ways and means of encompassing the ideal.
 I am becoming more and more confirmed in the view that it must go on as it is now doing, with ample liberty to the manager to regulate fresh admissions. Our life should become daily simpler and not more complex. We should be progressively more self-restrained. But we should remain a composite family that we now are.
 The present composition is not the hindrance. The hindrance is that we have so few real complete brahmacharis. All were broken vessels, all had their own individual passions to conquer. But I hold that most of them were and are sincere strivers. Therefore we are blind leaders of the blind and ever stumbling. When some of us have, by constant striving, become at least matriculates in the effort, we shall certainly do better. Therefore the problem resolves itself into each one
 of us striving to the utmost to approach the ideal. Remember my definition of brahmacharya. It means not suppression of one or more senses but complete mastery over them all. The two states are fundamentally different. I can suppress all my senses today but it may take aeons to conquer them. Conquest means using them as my willing slaves. I can prick the ear-drum and suppress the sense of hearing by a simple, painless operation. This is worthless. I must train the ear so that it refuses to hear gossip, lewd talk, blasphemy, but it. is open to the celestial music, it will hear the most distant cry for succour from thousands of miles. Saint Ramdas is said to have done so. Then how [to] use the organs of generation? By transmuting the most creative energy that we possess from creating counterparts of our flesh into creating constructive work for the whole of life, i.e., for the soul. We have to rein in the animal passion and change it into celestial passion. Read here Chapter II, Verse 64, of the Gita. The burden of the Divine Song is not “fly from the battle but face it without attachment”. Therefore you and I and every one of us have to stand unmoved in the midst of all kinds of men and women. There is no physical seclusion except temporarily for some. The Ashram is all right where it is but we must branch out for larger growth. But that would be a natural evolution coming in its own time.
Love from us all."

    DEAR 	FRIEND, I 	thank you for your long letterlibtech_873_footnotelibtech_874_footnote.  	I had one visit from Miss Mayo when she was in India. I have read 	her book and I wrote also a reviewlibtech_875_footnoteon it which at that time had attracted considerable 	attention. It is my firm conviction that the book

  	I was delighted to have your letter which you consider is long and 	which for us is too short. I see that you are one in your happiness. 	You are one also in your erosion though you tell me that both of you 	had the ‘flu, at the same time. You still remain the strangest 	pair I have ever had the good fortune to meet. one reads of such 	couples in Persian poetry but does not meet them in flesh and blood. 	May you for ever remain inseparables.  	Yes, I know, you in Europe are going through very hard tinues, both 	economically and spiritually. But I believe literally in the 	Biblical saying that “God would not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah so 	long as there is one good man the” I know that you have in Europe 	true men and women in all the odd nooks and corners of the 	Continent. I, therefore, feel that-in the end all will be well.  	I am glad you have got a copy of my little book, Guide to 	Health. It is an indifferent translation and then there  	are  some  chapters I would like to revise, and if at all I get the 	time and permission, I would certainly do so.  	Nature cure has made great strides since Kuhne’s time, and I 	should like to incorporate the results of new experiments. We are 	all keeping well, and all of us send you and Anandlibtech_876_footnoteour love. I do hear from Mira every week and write to 	her in return. To correspond with     
 me every week she forgoes the pleasure of writing to and meeting other friends. I will certainly convey your love to her. A letter is going to her today."

  	Sjt. Sastri, whom the office sent me as shorthand assistant is 	leaving me at the end of this month. Having got from Advocate 	Bhulabhai’s son his typist, I am disengaging Sastri two or three 	days earlier so that he can attend to what little things he has to 	in Bombay, but you will please pay him his pay to the end of the 	month.  	I have-not yet heard from Sjt. Dhirubhai how he has sent his typist 	to me. I shall therefore write to you later about the terms under 	which the new stenographer is to work. Of course in no case will he 	cost the Board more than  Sastri,  but  I  am  expecting  that  he  	will cost less.  	Sastri is leaving me only because he wants to attend to his old 	father and family affairs, not having gone there for some years. 	Latterly, he lost a brother-in-law. But he would gladly like to be 	able to return if he fails to get something better inside of four 	months. His wants are much larger than Rs. 100 but he knows that at 	the present moment even Rs. 100 is. a considerable sum. This is 	merely for your information.  	If at the end of four months or earlier I cannot keep the present 	typist on any account and if Sastri is free to come, I would 	naturally take him back. He has given me full satisfaction.

  	I thank you for an inscribed copy of Jeans’s The Stars 	in Their Courses. I had a glance at it 	before, but of course I shall prize the book you have sent me.

DEAR SISTER,
 I got your letter just now. N. Devi and her son are having their meal with me, and there will be some delay in their reaching your place. Kindly forgive me for that. I am asking Dr. Spiegel also to accompany them. I was very glad to read your letter. If you can be frank like this with me, I would feel no hesitation any time. on the one hand, there would be no limit to my begging as I am admittedly a beggar. But, while making immediate demands, I should also like to respect fully the donor’s own inclination. I, therefore, always try to put the prospective donor at ease whenever I hold out my begging bowl.
 I am first sending Shri Nair to the Servants of India Society and inquiring of them. If they can accommodate him, I will keep him there. In any case a car does have to come daily from there. This will mean only one trip more, and I don’t think there will  be  any difficulty about that. I will not fail to avail myself of your offer if there is any difficulty.
 I did not know about the mangoes. I do not eat them regularly, but generally depend on papaya. I will ask Sardar and let you know how the mangoes were. However, I do not want you to worry about such small matters. None of us has a delicate palate. We eat what we get and offer thanks to God.
 Blessings from

606,"April 27, 1933",LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI,"
    
 April 27, 1933
 
CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got the big post yesterday. You must have received the long letter which I dictated for you yesterday. I very much liked your letter which arrived in the big post. You have exercised good restraint in your language. There are signs of impatience here and there, but not much to speak of. Your reply is pointed and brief. I did not require it at all, but, since I have received it, it will help me to pacify Chhaganlal. It will not be necessary for me now to send his complaints to you. I will struggle with him in my own way, and try to remove his error. I will not waste your time, I have wasted enough of it.
 I suppose you have read Shri Rajbhoj’slibtech_885_footnoteletter. I liked it very much. He says in it that we have used more logic than the heart in dealing with Ramjilibtech_886_footnote. Since you   have  welcomed  his  suggestion,  the problem is over. Rajbhoj may be mistaken in his view. But it is also possible that we have been at fault. We should be able to prove to an inpartial Harijan the correctness of our treatment of Ramji in all respects. I am writing this not to find fault with anybody, but only to suggest how we should behave in future. How can I blame anybody without knowing all the facts? Read the letterlibtech_887_footnoteto Rajbhoj which I am going to write. He has suggested a change in the hour for the prayer.
 That suggestion also deserves careful consideration. His argument is that everybody should get time to answer the call of nature immediately after getting up. He has, therefore, suggested that 45 minutes should be set apart for this purpose instead of 20 as at present. This is what he says:
 Before answering the call of nature one is less likely to be able to concentrate at prayer-time. People also feel very sleepy. If the prayer is kept at 4.45, lassitude, the feeling of uneasiness arising from not having answered the call of nature and restlessness, all these three things will disappear.
This suggestion was made even before. But Rajbhoj has put it in
 
 
 a new way. He seems to be a thoughtful man. He is a fresh worker and is alert, and I also see in him good power of observation. He has discrimination, too. You should, therefore, have a long talk with him first and if you see some point in his suggestion, make the change suggested by him. It was I who insisted on the prayer being kept at 4.20—and I still insist on it—but the lesson of experience should prevail. If so many persons require to answer the call of nature before coming to the prayer, 45 minutes should be allowed for the purpose. Anyone who does not feel the need may use the time in any way he likes. If you decide to make the change, I will make some suggestions about the prayer. The chief thing is that you should have a detailed discussion with Rajbhoj.
His other suggestion is as follows:
 A meeting of all new workers should be held at least twice in a month. In these meetings there should be discussions as to how they should work, how they should serve meals, what the Mangalprabhat discourses are about, the significance of the vow of silence, etc. I have often observed that the volunteers who serve meals do not do their work courteously and patiently, they throw the vegetables down so carelessly that they fall outside the plate and they let the milk spill over, or serve these items in more than, or even less than, the required quantity. Those who are entrusted with washing the floor are so impatient to finish their work that they show no regard for slow-eaters and drops of water splash on the latter. It is the duty of the chief of this section to explain to the-volunteers from time to time how they should work.
 To save time in dictating I have given a Gujarati translation. of the sentences instead of the original Hindi. However, the translation is literal. The complaint which Rajbhoj makes could also be made with equal justification when I was in the Ashram and used to take my meals in the common kitchen. I had thought that there would not be much ground for such a complaint now. But since that has not happened, I can easily guess the reason. The volunteers change frequently, and it is very necessary that they should do so. But if that is necessary, supervision over them is equally necessary. I myself have observed vegetables being served in greater or lesser quantity than required. I have also observed too much hurry when serving. I have
 observed rotlis being thrown into the plate as if at a beggar, and milk being spilled on the floor. And even while a fairly good number of people were still eating, the volunteers used to start washing the floor.
 Inquire about this and do whatever is possible. I had a letter from . . .libtech_888_footnoteand I have replied to him. He is not likely to come round as quickly as I had thought. He also feels troubled about . . .libtech_889_footnoteand I have, therefore, replied to him that all of them have decided to leave the Ashram of their own accord. Even now they can stay on if they are ready to observe the Ashram rules. I have even advised that . . . should come and stay in the Ashram for some time. Have a talk with . . . .
 The key is held by him. If he comes, I will be relieved. But I certainly wish that, if he comes, he should do so with a full sense of his responsibility.
 I am eagerly awaiting your reply regarding N. If she is to come to the Ashram, I don’t wish to detain her here longer. If you have not written to me about this before you get this letter, send me a wire.
 You say in your letter that Narahari has written to me. But the post received from you did not contain any letter from him. Did he post his letter separately? or is it that he intended’ to write but forgot to do so?
 I have found Narahari’s letter in the post received today after I had written this letter.
I am sending a wirelibtech_890_footnoteabout N. and Dr. Margaret Spiel.

607,,APPENDIX,"
 EXTRACTS FROM DR. G. V. DESHMUKH’S LETTER TO GANDHIJIlibtech_891_footnote
 Between carrion of an healthy animal and slaughtered meat there is  no  chemical or physiological difference. . . .
 In the slaughter of animals, the animal bleeds and nearly all the blood being drained away, the slaughtered meat contains less blood. In the case of carrion, all the blood remains in the tissues of the animal and consequently the meat contains more blood.
 Decomposition sets in in every dead animal, whether killed or dead naturally. This decomposition is liable to set in earlier in moist tissues and tissues containing more blood. Carrion, therefore, is  liable  to  decompose  earlier  than  slaughtered  meat . . . .
 You might possibly think that meat, when it starts decomposing, is  universally rejected by human beings as food. It is not only the depressed classes of our country who partake of decomposing meat, but this practice is not uncommon in other parts of the world. Gypsies in Europe have been known to be fond of this practice; they go to the extent of even disinterring the dead carcasses of buried animals for food purposes. Decomposing fish is estimated to be an article of diet of more than three hundred millions of human beings in the world. . . .
 DISEASED MEAT: But all this is in the case of healthy animals. This cannot hold good in the case of diseased animals. Many epidemics of meat poisoning have occurred in the West which have been proved to be due to eating of meat from diseased animals, and the diseases in animals which lead to poisoning are not the prominent diseases in cattle which kill them, such as Anthrax and Glanders, but common, pus-producing diseases which do not attract so much attention in life. Hence the necessity of meat inspection in all civilized countries. In Indian villages where this practice of eating carcasses is more common, it will be seen how dangerous this practice is likely to be, on account of animals dying of diseases to which no importance is attached but which are particularly dangerous to human beings. . . .
 The meat of poisoned cattle is not poisonous to eat.	Poison is used by the
 Red Indians of America, also the Akas Tribe near Brahmaputra, in hunting for food with poisoned arrows, but the meat of this poisoned animal is eaten by them without any detriment to health.
 Probably the poison used in India is strychnine (kuchala) for killing cattle, but the meat of the dead animal is not poisonous to eat. Experiments have been carried on animals, such as dogs, by feeding them on poisoned meat of the animals killed by vegetable poison such as strychnine, escerine, pilocarpine, veratrine and
 
 mineral poisons such as arsenic and antimony; and meat in all these cases has proved to be harmless. The explanation is that, although the poison is strong enough to kill the animal, the poison is further oxidised into a harmless product and the meat, therefore, remains harmless. In the case of mineral poisons and caustics, very little is absorbed into the system of animals and the meat, therefore, contains very little of the mineral poison. Meat of poisoned animals, therefore, is harmless for eating purposes.
