Das raised a point of order on its admissibility. The latter said that “under article 21 only new matter could be considered. Unless new matter had arisen, all the rule-making powers of the Congress could be pressed into service. Under Article 31, this resolution making spinning obligatory could not be valid; for it infringed the fundamental right of electors to choose their own representatives. Further ex-officio members, like ex-presidents, were unfairly hit under this resolution and their constitutional right to be present sought to be deprived.” Gandhiji’s speech was reported by A.P.I. and a Special correspondent of The Hindu.
