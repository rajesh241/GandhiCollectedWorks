Some of his Mohammedan friends told him that they tried non-co-operation but if this would fail they would use the sword. He was against the use of the sword. The students who left the institutions must, in case their guardians refused them pecuniary help, break stones or beg and continue their studies, thus supporting themselves and their guru. Only those who were prepared to suffer must leave schools and colleges unconditionally, but they should not go out simply on account of excitement."

They should boycott the Councils, the polling-booths, and schools and colleges. The 30th of November was come, but they should not use their franchise; at the same time they should not persecute those who thought otherwise and wished to vote. Those who sat in the Councils should be told that they did not represent the people. But the voters also who abstained from voting should not then expect the members of the Councils to do anything for them.”"

If they would save the 60 crores of rupees which were being spent in buying British goods, they would command the services of the 57 members of Parliament from Lancashire. If they determined to use only swadeshi goods they would get swaraj. But that could only be possible when they acquired simple habits. They should no longer put on muslin.
