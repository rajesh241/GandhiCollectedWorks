1,"March 	20, 1947",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
           MASAURHI, 
  March 	20, 1947  	You know I have returned after a two days’ stay at Bir. I could 	see within these two days the damage wrought by us.libtech_339_footnotelibtech_340_footnoteToday 	 also  I saw a villagelibtech_341_footnotelibtech_342_footnotewhich had been deserted, and where a large number of 	women and children had been killed. I cannot narrate the whole 	story,       
 because my heart is so full that I might burst into tears if I tried to tell it. One who wants to see things for himself can still go there. We have not been able to do anything by way of reparations during all these months. The devastated villages continue to wear a deserted look. Even now thieves and dacoits haunt the place and carry away goods since no Muslim stays there. And how can the Muslims stay at a place where their brothers and sisters, parents and children have been slaughtered? The mere memory of the massacre will stun them. I myself, perhaps, could not have stayed there. You might argue that the Government should rebuild or repair the damaged houses. But I ask you, ‘Did you seek permission from the Government, when you resorted to murder, loot and arson?’ You have to atone for the sins, not the Government, because, after all, the Government is your own and not imported from England.
 If you rebuild Muslim houses and clean up their villages, they may think of returning to their homes in the confidence that Hindus had become their brothers, forgetting and forgiving the death of their relatives, who, after all, had to die one day or other. But this can happen only if you rebuild their houses with your own hands, clean their wells, sink new wells to replace the old ones filled with corpses of massacred Muslims. Muslims will trust you only when you do all this; and then they will return to their villages on their own. I appeal to every Hindu brother and sister to participate personally in undoing the damage. Those who are convinced that this is their duty should enter their names in the list with me or with Mridulabehn. Those who cannot come to me here or at Patna, should send their names by post. Much work remains to be done at Masaurhi too. You should render service wherever necessary, preferably in your own neighbourhood. There is no need for outsiders to come over to Masaurhi for the work of resettlement. Put up beautiful houses in place of the debris so that one who looks at them will hardly believe what ruins were there. When you do this it is bound to influence the other provinces too and its fragrance will spread all over India.
 I would request you not to think of celebrating a Punjab Day. Never make the mistake of avenging the Punjab in Bihar. Just as the Muslims here are in panic, so are the Hindus trembling in fear in Noakhali at the talk of a Pakistan Day. I wish to reach the ears of Janab Suhrawardy Saheb, the Chief Minister of Bengal. I wish to remind him that he had called upon me, as a Hindu, to go to Bihar
 where Hindus had perpetrated many atrocities, and that I came to Bihar at his bidding. The Hindus here have indeed committed many sins which need to be atoned for. I am myself undergoing penance. That is why I am here in Bihar although I have many tasks awaiting me at Sevagram, and in Delhi. If Suhrawardy Saheb wishes that I should remain in Bihar, he should prevent the observance of a Pakistan Day in Bengal. I do not want to prevent the Muslims from demanding Pakistan; but they should do so by explaining the advantages of Pakistan. Even if they want to observe a Pakistan Day, they should do so by convincing the Hindus so that they don’t get nervous.
 Hindus have been writing to me and confessing their guilt. I am also receiving letters written by Hindus and Muslims that because of the fraternal feeling there had been perfect peace in their villages and that they will never turn into each other’s enemies. Such sentiments make me happy. I am also happy that people are contributing generously for the relief of afflicted Muslims. But now I would appeal to you to donate not merely money but also your own hard labour ; take up the trowel and get down to reconstructing the homes of Muslims which you have destroyed.

The dictation can only be in 	English because Rangaswamy is not an efficient Hindustani writer.  	The first thing is to give you the sad news that Nirmal Babu 	abruptly left yesterday. He had prepared me for the news two days 	ago. He was wanted by his University. He had some private work too. 	And so he was to leave. But he suddenly took it into his head to 	leave yesterday. I had not the heart to detain him against his will 	and to come between him and what he thought was his dharma at the 	time.   
 Kakasaheblibtech_346_footnotewrote to me three days ago that he would like me to have Bisen by my side. I was thinking what to do and though I know that he could not in any way be a substitute for Nirmal Babu the latter’s absence has made me come to a hurried decision that if Bisen is not wanted by you he should join me. He is a handy man who knows Gujarati as well as his mother tongue. He is a willing worker. So if you can spare him and he wants to come you can send him. Let him go to Patna and report himself at Dr. Mahmud’s place. I sent you a telegram today about sending Bisen here.libtech_347_footnote
 I am here touring in Patna district and looking at the awful scenes of destruction wrought by human beings gone mad. I had hoped that I would be able at the outside, in a fortnight, to go back to Noakhali and its velvety earth and soft grass. I very much fear that I must now do Noakhali work from here as I had flattered myself while in Noakhali that I was also doing Bihar work. Having come here I see how vitally necessary it was for me to come. I do not know that I won’t have to undertake a pilgrimage on foot here also. Probably I shall not be able to do so on foot. But everything is in the lap of God. It is quite clear to me that whatever be my fate you should all,
including the Sevagram party, stick to your posts.
How is Sardar Jivan Singhji shaping himself?"

   FROM THE DIARY  
 MASAURHI,
 March 20, 1947
 It was 1 a.m. when Manudi completed counting the money. She should have gone to bed soon after the collection. She could have written the shlokas some other time. Or, I should relieve her of some of my work. It distresses me very much that she is not getting enough sleep. I wonder what I should do about it. Let her tell me if she can think of something. She can help me a lot in this matter if she wishes to. But she is unwilling to free herself from any work whatever. The collection was a thousand.

    LETTER TO SIR HUGH DOW        PATNA, 
      DEAR 	FRIEND,  March 	21, 1947 
  	I have your three letters for all of which I thank you. As you know 	at present I am touring in the affected parts of Bihar. But I shall 	bear in mind your kind offer about making use of your beautiful 	garden to rest a little from the din and noise that surround me.  	The word “bureaucrat” was usedlibtech_352_footnoteby me in its original sense. You do not represent 	autocracy. Certainly not democracy. But, as I hold, you essentially 	represent bureaucracy. Several English friends, some holding as high 	a place as you do, told me frankly that, representing as they did a 	big corporation of bureaucrats, they were unable to give effect to 	the full man in them. With this thought at the back of my mind I 	could not help admiring your remark that experience had taught you 	that after all the true reformer must begin with himself.   In 	his reply dated March 22, the addressee about this said : “I 	suppose, I am a bureaucrat in the sense used by you : it is not a 	term that I resent. The complexity of modern life ties most rulers 	to their desks more than they like, and this must be true even of 	yourself. But I look forward to the early day when neither half of 	this word will have much application to me.” 
 As to the rest of your letter of March 17 which you were kind enough to send so promptly, I gladly accept your correction and the presentation of your position.libtech_353_footnoteI am hoping that something will come out of this frank interchange of views.
 I got your letter of the 18th instant only this morning. It was delivered some time yesterday. But it came into my hands only today. The notelibtech_354_footnotereferred to in your letter to the Prime Minister of Bihar has not yet come into my hands. I suppose it will be received by me tomorrow when I hope to reach Patna if I do not receive it earlier.
 Yours sincerely,

 DEAR SUHRAWARDY,
 Pardon the somewhat familiar style. I hope you got my wirelibtech_355_footnote[of] yesterday and that there was no justification for the fears  expressed to me. I have a right to expect you to act on the square. The heart is too full to enable me to say more.
I am just now in a little village in the devastated area.

   TALK WITH MUSLIM REFUGEESlibtech_356_footnote  
 HANSDIH,
 March 21, 1947
 I have been constantly trying to make everyone understand that they should give up fear. There is no fear in my heart and I advise you to fear no one but God. But how can people go and stay in houses which have been burnt or destroyed? I shall be glad if the Government builds houses for them or advances money for the purpose. When a man turns into a devil, he is neither a Hindu nor a Muslim.
 I do not know what arrangement has been made regarding rations. I believe it should not cause anyone any inconve- nience. People should remove every trace of fear from their hearts. Who can protect man better than God? We should have full faith in Him and muster up courage. He is not brave who perpetrates atrocities. That man is brave who boldly faces any calamity. I wish to reassure you. I have been unequivocally saying that any Hindu who harms or as much as touches a Muslim, would be causing my death. I am going everywhere. Patna district has been the worst-affected. Hence it may take a little more time. Subsequently I shall tour other districts ; but I shall not go out of Bihar. Badshah Khan had planned to go to the Frontier, but he has postponed his departure and will remain here for some time. He believes that the climate all over India will improve if Bihar improves its ways. Shah Nawaz  Saheblibtech_357_footnotelibtech_358_footnotehas  also  arrived.  His presence will be a great help. Mridulabehn has been accompanying me. She may go to Delhi for a couple of days, but will return immediately. She is working very hard, and she does not discriminate between a Hindu and a Muslim.
 I have thrown in my lot with you here. I do not get time even to read the newspapers. Friends read out some news to me. I have written to Pandit Nehru and sought information about the general conditions.libtech_359_footnoteFrom what we hear, neither the Punjab nor Noakhali is yet entirely peaceful. But I shall stay on in Bihar till you are satisfied and until Hindus and Muslims on their own reassure me and tell me that I can leave without any anxiety.
 Only tents have been erected at Masaurhi ; the camp will start functioning soon. But it would be better if you built your own houses, because the whole atmosphere is reeking with corruption and black- marketing and the contractors are after unlawful gains. You should therefore try to build your own houses. I have been calling upon Hindus to help Muslims in every possible way, by cleaning their  houses, streets, and removing the debris. I am going to make the same appeal to Hindu Congressmen and representatives of villages today.

   TALK WITH VILLAGE REPRESENTATIVESlibtech_360_footnote  
 HANSDIH,
 March 21, 1947
 Q. Is it [not] difficult to stop riots so long as the system of zamindari continues? The landlords are the persons who incite riots and will continue to do so.
 A. I think it is foolish to connect riots with zamindari. The problem of zamindari is very old. How is it rational to kill Muslims to solve that problem? And many of the zamindars are themselves Hindus. The Maharaja of Darbhanga is a very big zamindar. Should he and his wife be killed? I am very friendly with him. He respects me like a father because his late father was a good friend of mine. A Hindu zamindar from North Bihar has promised to provide land to the Muslims. It is not proper to link the problem of Hindu-Muslim riots with the zamindari system. The latter is an altogether different problem and we have to consider ways and means of abolishing the system.
 Then Gandhiji was informed of the talk that the property lost by the Muslims here would be restored to them only when what was lost by the Hindus in Noakhali and the Punjab was restored to them. There would be friendship only when cases in Bihar as well as in Bengal were withdrawn simultaneously.
 Has the time arrived when the Muslims in Bihar must obey the dictates of Hindus? Must they stop going into mosques or reciting the Koran if Hindus prohibit it? No one has yet shown the courage to say this. But the demand that Muslims should live at the mercy of Hindus
 
 boils down to this. Those who are demanding Pakistan also seem to think on these lines. I ask those who see no harm in imitating the Punjab and Bengal whether Hindus should also turn ruffians if Muslims choose to do so. After all, how should a Hindu devoted to ahimsa or brahmacharya carry himself? I do not intend to suggest that nothing untoward happened in Noakhali. But there women, children and old persons were not murdered the way it happened here, nor was it on such a large scale. As it is Satis Babu has again invited me to Noakhali. But I think if I have to die in the attempt to  restore communal harmony, it is better to die here than in Noakhali.
 Nor is it right to demand withdrawal of prosecutions. Our non- violent methods are altogether different, but the Governments functioning today are based on the theory of punishment. Why then should they not arrest and punish the culprits? If the culprits in Noakhali are not being arrested, it is the fault of the Government there, which is not following the tenets of Islam. If the present trends continue there, Bengal will not become free, nor will Muslims there be free. Your proportion in the population is much greater here. In Bengal, the proportion of Muslims to Hindus is 51 to 49. Here, only 12 persons in 100 are Muslims. What sort of bravery is it to kill the 12? The Ramayana says that even a dog should be given a hearing. Rama abandoned Sita in response to the argument of a washer- woman. Devotees of the Ramayana ought to fall at the feet of every guilty person and appeal to him to come forward and confess his crime. When he pleads guilty and repents or atones for it or begs to be given due punishment for his crime, we may then let him go with a mild chastisement in view of his honest penitence.
 I wish to give vent to the fire that is raging within me in the course of my answers to your questions. Why should we behave in this manner? Neither you nor I have a correct picture of what is happening in the Punjab. Anyway, whatever it may be, it is indeed deplorable. But we have to keep our houses clean. We need not make our houses filthy because another person fills his house with filth. If you [do not] act according [to my advice], remember you will be sorry for it. You will regret that you did not listen to this old man’s advice. There are people, I know, who say that Muslims are like serpents and that just as we would kill a snake we should also kill Muslim women and children along with their menfolk. I tell you such
 people are mad. They are not Hindus ; they do not know what is Hinduism. There are similar fanatics among Muslims too; but they are not true Muslims. In the beginning the protagonists of Pakistan used to insist that Hindus in their region would have to live like Muslims. But now they concede that minorities will have to be protected. I remind you again that those who hurt Muslims will be hurting me. I am camping here simply to put an end to this fratricide or die in the effort.
 Q. What should we do if Muslims do not trust us even when we reassure them?
 A. If you speak to them earnestly and reassure them, they will certainly come, because no one likes to leave his home on his own. Give us the names of the villages whose Muslim residents are not ready to return to their homes in spite of assurances from the Hindus so that we may trace those people and persuade them to return to their villages.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       CHORHUAN, 
  March 21, 1947 I wish that 	those who have assembled here would think of the damage done and the 	number of men, women and children brutally done 	to death in this village, and sit in mournful silence in memory of  	the deceased. This will do you good. You will consider for 	yourselves why those who committed these crimes did so. Was it to 	save their religion? I would rather say that they did not thereby 	save any religion but harmed it. No religion teaches anyone to kill 	his neighbours. Righteous wars do take place, but I do not approve 	of them either. In the Bhagavadgita, too, 	oppressors and tyrants were resisted in a righteous war. It is the 	work of ruffians to kill innocent children and blameless men and 	women. A marauder wreaks destruction on others out of selfishness or 	ignorance. Whatever has happened here is, in my opinion, the work of 	oppressors and barbarians. Many houses have been burnt down and many 	others have been reduced to debris. The houses which a few months 	ago were full of life, are now desolate. 
 Why we turned into such barbarians will be revealed only in future. But the immediate problem is what you should do next. It is the duty of all men and women, I think, to clean the ruined houses and make them neat and habitable. We can always render  some service, however poor we may be. Mere bathing in the Ganga does not wash away our sins. We should undertake honest cleansing. We can keep our bodies clean by bathing in clean water. But all men and women should cleanse themselves in every other way also. They  should render all service honorarily and in a spirit of expiation. Did those who committed arson do it for any payment? We must wipe out the stains of their demoniac deeds with the water of human kindness. You should go to the Muslim brethren and tell them to forget the past, that it will never be repeated and persuade them to return and live peacefully as before. Tell them that their misery is your misery, that you are their brothers, that both Hindus and Muslims are sons of the same soil, both eat and drink from the same source and breathe the same air, hence there should be no ill will between them. Tell them that you will not get any peace of mind until they return to their homes. It is possible that the Muslims may turn round and ask how they can go back and live in the houses where their kith and kin have been done to death. They will be justified in saying so. But if the guilty persons go to the Muslims with truly penitent hearts, I am sure, they will be persuaded. Human hearts melt before love. When the murderers themselves go to them in sackcloth and ashes and promise them never to repeat such deeds, even a stony heart will melt.
 You should not depend on the Government to do this work. The Government will of course lend a hand. But it is mainly your task. The Government can give you tools and materials ; but the cleaning has to be done by you.
 Amidst this mad upheaval there were some Hindus, like oases in a desert, who risked the wrath of the violent mobs and saved the lives of many Muslims and gave them shelter. They  deserve congratulations though they do not need any. They have done their duty and acquired punyalibtech_361_footnote. Punya contains all congratulations. Since we have become strangers to human sentiments these days, we are impelled to congratulate any evidence of human love. Those who gave shelter to Muslims did not do so from any selfish motives. If I have not gone to meet them, let them not think that I have no regard or respect for them. I would love to meet them and know how they
 saved the lives of Muslims. I have been unable to go to them in spite of my admiration because I have come here like a physician who goes only to those who are suffering. I have come to lighten the sufferings of Muslims in Bihar.
 I have been told that the Hindus have also suffered in the riots at some places. If there are any such Hindus, they too will be given relief. But I pay more attention to Muslims because there are quite a few of them here who are willing to help the Hindus.
 I have been told that about fifty persons, who were wanted in connection with riot cases, surrendered themselves the day after my arrival at Masaurhi. I welcome this and hope that others who had taken part in the riots will also surrender to the appropriate authorities, making a clean breast of the crimes they had committed and taking whatever punishment might be given to them. If they do not have the courage to surrender to the authorities, let them come to me or to Badshah Khan or to Major-General Shah Nawaz with their confessions.
 A friend from Bengallibtech_362_footnotelibtech_363_footnotehad  recently  come  to  me  and  told  me that the Hindus in Noakhali are apprehensive about the preparations being made by the Muslims to observe the Pakistan Day and wish that I should return to Noakhali. I have asked the friend to return to Bengal without insisting on my going there. I am doing the same work here that I was doing in Bengal. If the Hindus in Bihar become honest and convince the Muslims that no harm will be done to them and if Muslims too do not want to take revenge in view of the Hindus’ promise to look after them well, it will have its effect on the whole of India. As a result of this Muslims in Noakhali may also assure Hindus of their safety. There is no question of abandoning my post of duty till the Hindus and Muslims from both these regions assure me that they do not need my services. The Muslims of Bihar and the Hindus of Bengal should accept me as security for the safety of their lives and property. I shall suffer if they are made to suffer in any way.
 I have repeatedly said that I have come here to do or die. If communal peace is not established, I shall pray to God to hasten my end, because, in that event, I shall not be in a position to serve anyone.

  March 	22, 1947  	I am sad as well as glad to meet you all. There are many sisters 	here whose husbands, sons and relations have been killed. Their 	tragic tales make me sad. I was very glad to hear that the S. D. O. 	acted very promptly and prudently to prevent riots here, and that 	refugees from other places were given shelter here. Hindus from this 	place have written to me saying that they did not participate at all 	in the riots.  	I have seen with my own eyes how much people have suffered because 	of the riots. I have seen houses which were burnt or looted, and I 	was told that the residents had been killed.  The aggrieved people, 	the people whose houses have been destroyed, wish to resettle    military 	has taken 	over control. 	As a 	result, on 	the surface 	things seem to 	have quietened 	down somewhat. But no one can say when there may be a flare-up 	again. If that happens, I 	am afraid, even Delhi 	will not remain 	unaffected. But here 	of course 	we shall 	be able 	to deal 	with it.  
 at some other place. Personally, I do not approve of this. Why should we lose heart? We should keep up courage. The Hindus have committed a sin. What have they gained thereby? You do not trust them. But if their hearts are cleansed, if they clean your houses, if they build new houses for you and if they sincerely atone for their sins, why should you then not return to your homes? True bravery on the part of Hindus consists in confessing their guilt and changing their hearts. I shall be only too glad if they do this.
 People should return to the houses where there had been no killing. If the residents don’t feel like going  to  murder-haunted houses they may shift to another place. It would be good if lands can be exchanged by mutual consent. It may not be possible for the Government to arrange such transfers. In any case whether they return to their own villages or shift to some other place, Muslim brothers and sisters should eschew all anger and bear no ill will towards Hindus. You should not think of taking revenge against those who have oppressed you. That is true bravery.
 How transitory is this life? Everyone has to die one day. It is difficult to comprehend the ways of God. Is there any place where He is not present? Some people hold God responsible for whatever has happened. Who can understand His ways? God cannot be talked about disparagingly. Why should we, then, blame Him for these happenings? I do not wish to hear such talk from the lips of those who recite the kalma. In fact, no one should even speak in this vein.
 I wish to reassure all of you that I am wandering from place to place to prevent a repetition of what has happened so that Hindus and Muslims may live like brothers. I shall stay and strive here as long as hearts are not cleansed and fraternal feelings are not revived. I shall do or die; I shall either succeed in my mission or perish in the effort.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_369_footnote        PATNA, 
  March 	22, 1947  	I have returned to Patna today after a five-day tour. You would have 	learnt from newspapers where I went and what I said. I liked the 	attitude of the villagers. They are genuinely penitent. Liberal 	contributions are being made by them for the relief of their Muslim 	brethren. I was very happy to see this. Many persons have also 	written to me that they will not misbehave again.  In 	a number of places, Gandhiji said, due to the bravery of the local 	Hindus, no incidents had occurred. He was told by the Muslims 	themselves that in Dinapore Sub- division no trouble occurred though 	the Muslims were greatly nervous.  Gandhiji 	said that he had addressed the Muslim women refugees in the morning  	at Pipalwan.libtech_370_footnoteHe did 	not wish at present 	to enter 	into a 	description of 	the feelings 	of these 	women and their 	present condition. His 	heart was 	too heavy and 	he did not wish to 	shed tears. He 	only wanted to 	tell them how 	to repent. 	He tried 	as best 	as he could 	 to console 	them and 	persuade them 	to pick 	up courage 	and return 	to their 	villages, placing reliance on 	God. At 	this meeting 	he was 	told that Muslim women 	and men dreaded 	the approach 	of March 	22, as 	it had been 	reported that Punjab Day 	would be 	observed in 	Bihar on 	that date. 	He had 	told them that the Bihar 	Government had 	banned the 	observance of 	any kind 	of day, 	be it Pakistan 	Day or 	Punjab Day. The 	Minister who was present 	also gave the assurance 	that no 	celebration of 	any kind 	would be 	permitted and 	that the 	ban would be strictly 	enforced throughout 	the province. The Bihar Government, Gandhiji said, had banned the kisan rally also. It 	is a different thing that the rally should not have been tarred  	with the same brush. But the situation is very delicate today. Our 	people’s hearts are not clean. Hence even a kisan rally 	should be abandoned. I shall appeal to the people concerned not to 	celebrate either a Punjab Day or a Pakistan Day. The Ministers have 	issued the order after much deliberation; hence the order must be 	obeyed. If one wishes to disobey a law as a satyagrahi, one can do 	so. When we have the voting right we can remove the Ministers if we 	do not approve of their policies. But so long as they are in 	authority, we must carry out   
 their orders.
 A true satyagrahi should implicitly obey the directions of those he had himself put in power. What Gandhiji said did not refer only to March 22. It applied to the future also and at no time should these celebrations be indulged in, so long as the atmosphere remained as it was that day.
 There is a conflagration in every quarter today. A kisan rally is not advisable in these circumstances. You can write to the Government about the difficulties you are facing. You can agitate through newspapers. Rallies are intended to awaken the kisans and to organize the people. I have been leading such activities for the past sixty years and am quite an expert in these matters. Conditions today are not conducive for such activities. The Gita speaks of action in inaction and inaction in action.libtech_371_footnotelibtech_372_footnoteIf I apply this to the present-day context, it means we can do a lot of good by keeping quiet. We should discriminate between dharma and adharma. There are occasions when keeping away from adharma becomes the dharma. It is no doubt our duty to awaken the kisans. But this is not the time for it. It is the duty of every Hindu to follow the teachings of the Gita, although anyone in the world can derive benefit from the Gita . No one can say that we should repeat the same action in season and out of season. We are subserving our waking hours even when we sleep; but if we go on sleeping all the time we will be as good as dead. This only means that every action has its appropriate time. Desisting from an inopportune action is as good as timely action.
 The 22nd March has passed off peacefully. It is a good thing. We should now forget all about it. We don’t have to celebrate a  Punjab Day or a Pakistan Day. These days are intended only to make us fight. But our Muslim brothers here do not wish to fight. Why should we then celebrate a Punjab Day?
 I concede that a kisan rally stands on a different footing. But the times are not propitious even for a kisan rally. Every action should be undertaken at an appropriate time. This is an occasion for penitence. We should first atone for our sins. It is part of the atonement to realize that the atrocities committed on Muslim brothers and sisters constitute grave sins. If we are convinced that the Hindu heart has been cleansed through such atonement, then we can organize a kisan rally.
 
 Major-General Shah Nawaz Khan has arrived here. Badshah Khan who intended to leave, has postponed his departure. A scheme is being prepared to rehabilitate the Muslims who have suffered at our hands. Every Hindu brother and sister should go to villages and put in hard labour, not for the sake of wages but in a spirit of service. We should clean up Muslim villages and rebuild their houses to convince them that once again we have become their brothers although for a time we had gone berserk.
 Some officials have informed me that about fifty persons have confessed their crimes. They have admitted that they are guilty. They are prepared to undergo any punishment meted out to them. This is a welcome development. But thousands have committed such crimes. All these thousands should confess their crimes. Then the Muslims will not be in a position to say that the criminals have not been  arrested. Whoever has committed a crime should frankly say that earlier he was afraid of prosecution, but having made a confession he is now prepared to undergo any punishment. This would not only enhance their own prestige but also that of Bihar as a whole.

 The reply you gave to Narandas is perfectly correct. I have written to him, too.
 You need not worry about Manu at all. She is still forgetful, of course, and indifferent about herself. I have explained to her that those who are free from all impure feelings or desires are indifferent about nothing, nor do they forget things. She understands this, but is unable to act upon it.

    DISCUSSION WITH WOMEN WORKERS libtech_374_footnote       PATNA, 
  March 	23, 1947  QUESTION: 	Can women take part in 	politics while they are working in the Kasturba Memorial Fund?  GANDHIJI: This question 	can be answered in two ways: they can and cannot take part in 	politics. If they want to serve, they should not take part in 	politics. There is Congress rule in the country at present (it may 	be socialism or communism in future). Now, supposing it is necessary 	to sell spinning-wheels or khadi for the sake of propaganda in the 	villages, women can take part in such activities. But supposing the 	intentions of the Congress go wrong and instead of khadi it wants to 	sell liquor in the villages, the sevikaslibtech_375_footnotewould certainly not take part in such an activity. 	Rather, they would start a satyagraha campaign against it if it 	became necessary. Women can take part in any activity which is in 	the interest of the country irrespective of the ‘ism’ of the 	ruling party.      
 Q. When we raise slogans in the villages the Muslims do not join us. What should be done about it?
 G. You must keep quiet and try to persuade them. If they still do not come forward, you must give up raising slogans. As for me, I do not give importance to slogans any more. People have been stabbed while cries of Bharatmataki jai and Gandhijiki jai were being raised. That is why slogans have become so repugnant. It is easy to understand such feelings.
 Q. Women do not still seem to give up untouchability and purdah. What should
  we 	do?   G. 	If they do not give them up they must be persuaded to do so. 
  	You must carry on your work. You should not worry about  the  	results. Those who want to serve should continue to work more and 	ever more, and firmly hold on the truth.  A. 	HARIJAN WOMAN: Nobody is 	willing to sit by my side. What should I do?  G. (Smiling): There are 	so many women sitting around you. You must forget that you are a 	Harijan. Things would automatically smoothen out if you do that. [ 	From Gujarati ]  Biharni 	Komi Agman, pp. 89-90   
    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_376_footnote       PATNA, 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  March 	23, 1947 
    	I request you and those others whom my voice could reach to 	understand the aim of life. The sole purpose of life is that we 	should serve the creation of the Power which has created us and on 	whose mercy or, say, kindness, depends out very breath. Let us not 	destroy this creation. But today, in our arrogance we have either 	lost sight of this cause or we tend to forget it and are either 	fighting each other or preparing to do so. If we cannot avoid this 	calamity, you may be sure that India’s independence is an 	impossibility. If you think you can  
 achieve independence by the simple fact of the British quitting the land, you are sadly mistaken. If we continue to fight amongst ourselves even after their departure some other power would step in. To think that we can fight the world with its own weapons is like expecting a barren woman to give birth to a child.
 A friend has written that a semblance of peace appears to have been established in the Punjab. But this peace and tranquillity has come through military occupation. Everyone is preparing openly for a fight and is busy collecting arms. If these preparations continue the peace established through the army or the police will ultimately turn out to be the peace of the grave. Real peace will come about only when one party at least silently adopts the course of true bravery. Bihar has realized through its own experience that there can be no bravery in killing women and children, or old and innocent people, that it is sheer cowardice. What a grand thing it would be if Bihar could show the real power of non-violent bravery and thus guide India and the whole world on the path of true life.libtech_377_footnote

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        RAJGHAT, 
  March 24, 1947 It is well 	nigh impossible for me to say anything amid such noise. I can say 	something only when you are quiet. In the first place, I 	 wish to address a  few words to the men and  women volunteers. I     
 have told them before also what they should do during the tours. It is the duty of women volunteers to guide women as to how they should sit and conduct themselves at public meetings. For this they should distribute leaflets beforehand and should read them out for their benefit. The men who are either standing or sitting are keeping quiet, but because the women are not quiet, they cannot also hear anything. In fact, it is not women alone who are to be blamed for this. They are over-worked, poor and illiterate. They behave as they are told by their menfolk. If we have to take work from them, we should make them understand things and educate them. It is the duty of the women volunteers first of all to tell women the rules to be observed at public meetings.
 Today I saw a villagelibtech_400_footnotewhere Hindus too have suffered losses. I had been asked earlier to visit that village. I realize the Hindus have suffered but that in no way mitigates their guilt. I did not visit the place with the thought of the Hindus who have suffered there. But that does not mean that I am hurt only at the loss of Muslims and that Hindus’ sufferings do not move me. I am equally pained at the sufferings of all persons. In the words of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, founder of the Aligarh University, I would say that the Hindus and the Muslims are like the two eyes of Mother India. Just as the trouble in one eye afflicts the other too, similarly the whole of India suffers when either Hindus or Muslims suffer. If you realize this, I would think my purpose has been fulfilled.

    LETTER TO HORACE ALEXANDER       PATNA, 
  March 	25, 1947  MY 	DEAR HORACE,  	Gladys has given me your letter and I had a fairly long discussionlibtech_401_footnotelibtech_402_footnotewith 	her as a result of which she has written to you a letter which I 	enclose herewith. She has gone to see the Friends’ Unitlibtech_403_footnotelibtech_404_footnoteand 	she is expected to return tonight. I think her presentation of my    
 position is fairly correct. But let me put it in my own language.
 What I feel is that however much detached we may want to be from our surroundings and the unseen atmosphere about us,  we cannot but be affected by it. Hence I am not sure whether, whilst the British military forces are in India, we can possibly be in real Indian atmosphere of peace and tranquillity, if these are ever to be her lot during our generation. The present distemper may continue beyond January next and if it does not I am afraid it won’t be because of sanity regained by the communities but because of the fear of the military. What is the use of our meeting under the protection of the bayonet, whether it is British or Indian? May it not be wise therefore for sincere peace-lovers to pray in their own homes, every day if you like, even for five minutes at the same time throughout the world? It will be easy enough for everyone to find out the hour which should correspond with the time, say, in Calcutta or any place in India. We can even make the calculations and publish the different times for the different centres. The value would lie in finding the exact time. If you still think that a meeting should take place here,  I  suggest postponement till after the withdrawal of British arms.
 These are my random thoughts, not for you to act upon unless they fully appeal to you, because in this matter I have yielded to your judgment. If you propose to go on with your idea and want to have the meeting at the time you have conceived, send me the thirty names and I shall send you my suggestions as to whether I want to add to the list.
 With reference to milk distribution in Madras you have another Ministry there now.libtech_405_footnoteI wonder if it will make any difference. I hold on to my suggestion.
 About my own private affair I have done and am doing all I can. I suppose you already know that Manu no longer sleeps in the same bed with me. This departure was made by her with my full approval in order to please Bapa who, though he saw absolutely nothing wrong, would appeal to her not to continue [it] whilst I was in Bihar and whilst I was engaged in this important work. I do not agree with the conclusion. But I did not wish to argue and therefore I promptly agreed.
Whilst I am dictating this letter I see that you could not know
 
 this because the decision was made on the last day of my stay in Haimchar. What, however, is the subject of examination is my mental attitude, whether it is correct or whether, as Kishorelal and some other Indian friends consider, it is a remnant of my sexuality however unconscious it might be. My whole mental outlook will be changed immediately I saw this defect in me. Only then, the weakness was coeval with the time when I took the vow of brahmacharya which was probably in 1902libtech_406_footnote.It may be that their definition of  brahmacharya  is different from mine.
 I return the draft with very slight corrections if it is to go at all. Love.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        PATNA, 
  March 	25, 1947  	My third tour will commence tomorrow. I shall go to Jahanabad and 	return on March 28. The prayer meeting will again be held here on 	the 29th.  	I saw the destruction in the village which I visited and met the 	Hindus and the Muslims there. Today also I have  been meeting people 	throughout the day. One Muslim friend said that it was very good 	indeed that I visited them. Now they were convinced that nothing of 	this sort would recur. But I was pained by what another Muslim 	friend told me. He said that the Hindus were now boycotting the 	Muslims. Sometimes boycott could be a welcome thing but it is bad if 	it is directed against one’s own brother. Suppose we have been 	under the treatment of a Muslim doctor till today, as for instance I 	used to be treated by Dr. Ansari,libtech_413_footnotelibtech_414_footnoteHakim 	Ajmal Khanlibtech_415_footnotelibtech_416_footnoteor Dr. Abdul Rehman. Should we stop being treated by 	him as soon as a Hindu- Muslim riot breaks out? Boycott had an 	important place in our struggle against the British. But if it is 	adopted amongst ourselves it will amount to violence. The Hindus 	have committed a sin in Bihar and today they are the guilty ones ; 	do they now want to persist in doing wrong? The case of the doctor 	was cited only as an example. The gentleman mentioned by me is a 	businessman and landlord. Both Hindus and Muslims had their shops on 	his land and did business there. It was a source of income for him. 	But now the Hindus have stopped going there; this is a pernicious 	boycott. It so happens sometimes that one who is engaged as a tailor 	does not like anyone else to take up that profession. There was a 	time when a tailor’s son took to tailoring only. But now a 	tailor’s son can also become a head clerk. Such ill will and 	feeling of animosity should be given up.   
 Let me give you some good news too. Today some League friends met me and expressed their wish to live with the Hindus amicably and wanted the Government to listen to them. I said to them that though the League represented a large number of Muslims I did not agree that those who were outside the League were not Muslims or that the League was the sole representative of the Muslims. The boycott of the League would not do. I even asked the Noakhali Muslims to obey the orders of the League. So long as they were in the League, it was their duty to carry out its orders. But if the League misguided them and asked them to slit the throats of the Hindus, they should refuse to obey it and quit the League.
 The League friends also said: “Though we belong to  the  League still we are friends of the Hindus. If the Government does not take us into confidence, how can the Muslims trust it? It we plead with the Muslims who had run away, they will come back. But if we do not co-operate how many Muslims can you bring back? Maybe a few of them would return. But all of them will not . The Government should consult us.” I told them it was a good and straightforward suggestion. Each should co-operate with the other and do his duty. When we work unitedly it will have its impact on India as well as on the world. It will purify our hearts. We should act only with a pure heart. What is the use of our being together without unity of hearts?
 I also heard some Muslims say that there were ten crore Muslims and even if one crore perished the remaining nine crores would fight for founding a nation of their own. I told them that if they had such notions they would not serve Islam in any way. On the contrary they would destroy it. I had told the Hindus also in Noakhali that they should get rid of all fear. We should fear God alone. It is cowardice to agree to something or to bow our heads before others out of fear.
 The friend from Noakhali has informed me that after my return from Noakhali the situation there has deteriorated again. I told him that if the Hindus in Bihar co-operated with me, I could work for Noakhali while I was still here. I would appeal to the Muslims of Noakhali, if my voice could reach them, to live in unity with Hindus, wherever they may be. Hindus should do likewise. I do not know what will happen in Noakhali in future—whether the surviving Hindus will be killed, their houses looted or burnt. But if this happens, the Muslims will dig their own graves. Even here I hear voices are being raised that scores will be settled once Gandhi goes away. This is a bad omen. I beseech you not to become cowards, but to be truthful and
 
 have faith in God. It is folly to agree to anything out of fear. Today some Domes came to see me. They told me that it was not only caste Hindus who boycotted them but even the Bhangis among Harijans boycotted them. They said that the Domes were normally engaged in bamboo work, only the poor ones did scavenging. They are not even aware of the exact strength of their community. Only one boy from the community goes to college. The Domes invited me to stay with them. I told them that, though I would like it, I was at the moment engaged in other very important work. I was grieved to know that the Bhangis did not allow them to draw water from their wells. Bhangis and other Harijan friends should not discriminate amongst themselves.  I fail to understand why others regard Harijans as inferior. I have myself become a Bhangi. If I swept your lanes and cleaned your latrines, and you hurled abuses at me and I tolerated them, how would  I then become low? Those who are engaged in scavenging are not inferior but it is those who abuse others that are low. Those who do the cleaning for us and serve us should be treated with love by all of us.

I think Mridulabehn has already told the local League in the same 	strain. You will certainly be informed when the date for the visit 	to Tilhara is fixed.

I. to a report 	in a 	section of 	the Press ( not The 	Indian Nation) about 	a letter 	said to 	have been received 	by him 	from the new Viceroy and his alleged reply thereto, he said that it was packed with half-  
 truths which he always held as more dangerous than full untruths and therefore, characterized half-truths as “a lie and a half”.
 Pressed for clarification Gandhiji said that he had no desire to run into the trap, however unconscious it might be. He added that whoever had concocted the message had done no service to the cause of Indian independence or to honest journalism. He would like Indian journalists not to copy the worst features of journalism of the West with which unfortunately it was reeking. But if there was to be imitation it should be of the best in Western journalism of which he was happy to be able to testify. Gandhiji said:
There are several brilliant examples in journalism and as a
 journalist of long standing, though an amateur, I must conclude by the warning that journalism which is rightly called the Fourth Estate should never degrade itself by becoming a means of making money. This caution is doubly necessary at the present critical time in the history of the country.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_419_footnote        JEHANABAD, 
  March 	26, 1947  Gandhiji 	began his post-prayer 	speech by referring 	to the 	common weakness 	of misunderstanding 	opponents, attributing to 	them motives 	which could not be 	proved. Such 	behaviour often 	led to 	untoward results which 	prudent people 	would avoid. 	Such misunderstanding was 	responsible for 	differences between the 	Congress and 	the League.libtech_420_footnoteBoth the 	organizations had 	a large 	following. The 	responsibility resting 	on them 	was all the greater for 	their popularity. Their 	conduct towards each 	other had 	to be above suspicion.  Gandhiji 	next referred 	to his 	visit to 	Kako Relief Camplibtech_421_footnoteand the village 	of Saistabad. 	Men and women 	burst into tears 	when they saw him. He 	told them that to 	break under one’s 	sorrow did not become 	brave people. All 	religions taught 	that sorrow 	should be bravely borne.  As 	he watched crowds of sturdy men pursuing him, mobbing his car and    
 shouting vociferously Mahatma Gandhiki jai, etc., he could well imagine the havoc they must have wrought when they attacked a handful of Mussalmans. The Hindus should be ashamed of the act. They should take a vow never to succumb to the madness again. Nor should they think of taking revenge for the incidents of the Punjab or the like. Would they themselves become beasts simply because others happened to sink to that level? If ever they became mad again, they should destroy him first. His prayer in that case would be that God may give him the strength to pray to Him to forgive his murderers, that is, to purify their hearts. He prayed that God may enable him to show by example what true bravery was. No one could mistake arson and murder of innocent women and children as a brave act. It was cowardice of the meanest type.
 Gandhiji next referred to a complaint that he had received from the Hindus of Kako enumerating their sufferings at the hands of Muslim zamindars. He interpreted it   as intended to minimize their own offence against the Mussalmans. It was not manliness to attempt to do so.
 Again Gandhiji referred to a report that he had heard of the Hindus threatening the Mussalmans that they would wreak vengeance on them when he (Gandhiji) was gone. It ill became the votaries of the Ramayana to try to suppress the fourteen or fifteen per cent of the Muslims in their midst. Men aspiring to be free could hardly think of enslaving others. If they tried to do so, they would only be binding their own chains of slavery tighter. It became their duty to go and beg forgiveness of the Mussalmans, and by their true repentance they should try to persuade them to go back to their homes. They should rebuild their houses. They should make their sorrow their own.

 CHI. CHIMANLAL,
 You may make whatever arrangement seems best to all of you regarding Kanchan. It is essential that her delivery pass off without any difficulty.
 Kanchan’s own desire in this matter should get the first priority. If she wants to have the delivery at her mother’s, please arrange it that way.
 It is for you all to decide whether you can arrange for the delivery in the old hospital building. I will raise no objection if you decide that. I cannot say more than this from here.
I understand about Hoshiaribehnlibtech_424_footnotelibtech_425_footnote.

 Tell Bhansalibhai that he should stop eating cereals and pulses until the fever disappears completely. He should till then live on milk, butter-milk and fruit. If he does that, the body will recover its normal health quickly. Raw kodra is taboo. We are not strong enough to digest it.libtech_428_footnote
Tell Prabhakar that he must get rid of his weakness.
 If    Shashilibtech_429_footnotetakes   friction-bath   regularly   and   observes   the necessary restrictions on diet, I am sure his fever will disappear. It will of course be good if he goes to Panchgani.
I understand about Kausambi’slibtech_430_footnotelibtech_431_footnoteillness.
 Why does Nayakumji get severe attacks of cold so often? Tell him that he must get rid of the disease once for all with the help of rural remedies, that is, by nature-cure methods. This is also part of basic education.

  Gandhiji 	said that the 	style in 	which the 	memorandum had 	been written, 	it could 	not represent the views of the people who surrounded him there 	because when he himself understood so little of it he was sure the 	illiterate friends around him could not 	understand what it 	conveyed. He asked how could the reader of the memorandum claim to 	represent the 	views of 	those for 	whom he spoke.  Referring 	to the 	complaints against 	the Hindus, 	Gandhiji said it was his 	mission to 	make people brave whether 	they were Hindus or 	Muslims and 	he asked the 	people who 	had submitted the 	memorandum not 	to preach cowardice among 	the Muslims. 	He gave the example of South Africa where he led the Indians, a bare 	handful of 13,000 	in the 	entire sub-continent, 	against great odds 	and those Indians were 	courageous enough today 	to fight 	their oppressors. In 	Bihar the Muslims 	were in 	a much 	greater majority than 	the Indians in 	South Africa and 	therefore they 	should be 	brave.  Gandhiji 	reaffirmed that he was not disloyal or unfaithful to the Muslims and 	that his one aim in life was to help the Muslims as long as he was 	alive and he would try to help them even by dying.  Before 	he left he invited the Muslims to come and see him and place fore 	him all the difficulties in their way.  The 	Indian Nation, 29-3-1947         
   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING libtech_437_footnote  
 
 
OKRI,
  March 	27, 1947  Gandhiji 	uttered the warning that Indians might lose the golden apple of 	independence which was almost within their grasp, out of insanity, 	which had caused scenes of desolation and destruction, and stated 	that the peace that reigned in the land was only on the surface. He 	said this while referring to his visit during the morning and 	afternoon to some riotaffected villages.  Gandhiji 	added that they knew the 	very first pronouncement 	that the Viceroy 	had made when he assumed 	office stated that he was sent as the last Viceroy to wind up the 	British rule 	in India. They must have 	noticed that 	the pronouncement 	was deliberate, 	unconditional and 	unequivocal. He 	said that we 	must trust British 	promises for it 	would be 	cowardice to 	say that all Britons 	were dishonest. 	That, he explained, 	would mean 	that we were 	ourselves dishonest. 	Gandhiji added that the 	jar of British 	sins was 	full and 	they must go 	but it 	was not right 	to abuse 	them while they were 	departing. He 	knew that it 	had become a 	fashion, though not 	without cause, to 	distrust every 	British declaration. He 	for one would advise the 	acceptance of 	every declaration 	at its 	face value without 	qualifying it in the 	light of 	past experience 	to the 	contrary. His 	experience was 	that it 	was the deceiver 	who always 	lost and never 	the dupe 	if he 	was honest and brave. But 	he very much feared on account of what had happened in the country 	that by 	their folly or, 	what was worse than 	that, insanity, they 	might let 	slip out 	of their hands 	their hard-won 	prize before it was strongly 	locked in their 	unbreakable fist.  Gandhiji 	referred to Bihar 	and the Punjab 	and said 	that he had wisdom 	enough to see 	that they themselves 	might tempt the 	Viceroy to 	eat his own words, 	uttered solemnly 	on a 	solemn occasion. 	Heaven forbid that such 	an occasion 	should arise, 	but, if it did, even 	though his might be a voice in the wilderness, he would declare that 	 the Viceroy should 	firmly and truly 	carry out his declaration 	and complete 	the British 	withdrawal.  Gandhiji 	then referred 	to his 	tour today in 	villages Amthua, Belai 	and Ghosi, 	this morning and Abdal 	Chak, Zulfipur and Abdalpurlibtech_438_footnote. He said 	that the same 	stories of atrocities 	were repeated the whole 	day. He advised the Congressmen 	who had approached 	him and said 	that innocent men were 	in jail 	as a result 	of communal 	cases, that 	they should produce those who 	were guilty and 	if they failed they 	should cease to be 	Congressmen. Gandhiji 	also advised the guilty 	to confess 	to him, 	for he 	would not 	give them away to 	Government but 	then they thought to 	atone for 	their sins. Gandhiji 	also requested 	Hindus to return all abducted women and girls, 	if any in their 	 possession, at once.     
 Gandhiji referred to the police strikelibtech_439_footnote, and said that the police, like the scavengers, should never go on strike. Theirs was an essential service and they should render that service irrespective of pay.
 There were many other effective and honourable means of getting grievances redressed. If he were a Cabinet Minister, he would offer the strikers nothing whatever under the threat of a strike, which implied force. He would give them the choice of an impartial arbitration, without any condition. He said:
It will be a bad day for India if the military, including the police,
rule India.
 He hoped the police would call off their strike unconditionally and request the Ministry to appoint an impartial arbitrator to investigate their case.
 Gandhiji also appealed to the policemen not to behave in the manner in which they were behaving then. Every policeman, he said, was a servant of the people and his duty was to behave like the Khudai Khidmatgars. Policemen were the custodians of law.
 Continuing, Gandhiji said that if every man, woman and child tried to understand his or her duty and if there was no theft or dacoity, there would be no need for policemen. Everyone could then become a policeman and help each other.
 Gandhiji expressed regret that the Bihar Government had employed British soldiers to deal with the strikers. No matter what the cause was, and wherever it was, the Indian Governments must never requisition the services of British soldiers to deal with civil disturbances. Otherwise it would mean that the Indian Governments were helpless without British arms.

   LETTER TO MANILAL AND SUSHILA GANDHI  
 JEHANABAD,
 March 28, 1947
 CHI. MANILAL,
 I got your long letter of March 7. You have given sufficient details. You need not hesitate to write to me out of compassion for me because of the pressure of work on me. I have not known a father who would not welcome a letter from his son or daughter. On the contrary, every father looks forward to such letters. It is true, of course, that if my sons were to write silly and sentimental letters, I would be pained to read them. But I have never taught any of you to be sentimental or to write such letters, nor is it in the nature of any of you to be or act so. I, therefore, have no fear on that score.
 I understand what you say regarding me. It is enough for me that you do not worry about me but leave me in God’s hands. It is also true that, if what I am doing is wrong, I alone will have to suffer the consequences. If it is good, its benefit will be shared by millions.
 If refusal to extend a welcome to the Princelibtech_440_footnoteis likely to do us any harm, we should endure it. When we accorded a welcome in our time the circumstances were different, and moreover we extended the
 
 
 welcome jointly with other people.libtech_441_footnoteKeep on sending me newspaper cuttings which you think I should read. I rarely read your journallibtech_442_footnote. And moreover in the midst of all this touring, how can I even get it?
 Dadoo and Naicker called on melibtech_443_footnoteas soon as they arrived. I was in Patna then. I had only a brief talk with them. They said they would come back and call on me again. They didn’t say a word regarding you. Nor did I ask them. I didn’t think it advisable to do so. And, moreover, your letter gives me all the information, and so really speaking I had nothing to inquire about.
 One thing seems certain, namely, that now the struggle will be carried on through selfless and elected representatives. I cannot say how long I shall be detained in Bihar and Noakhali.
I have to leave for Delhi the day after tomorrow to meet the new
 Viceroy. I think I will have to stay there for two or three days and then return here.
Don’t worry at all about Sitalibtech_444_footnotelibtech_445_footnote. I do whatever is necessary.

    TALK WITH MUSLIM REFUGEESlibtech_446_footnote        JEHANABAD, 
  March 	28 libtech_447_footnotelibtech_448_footnote, 1947 One memorandum 	suggested that Gandhiji’s 	reference to the  Noakhali incidents in his speeches instead of suppressing the feeling of Hindus here would  aggravate 	them.         
 Gandhiji answered that the inference was not correct for he had not spared the Hindus. In fact there was a time when he used to be equally plainspoken with the Muslims, too. He had even fasted for twenty-one days for what they had done in 1924.libtech_449_footnoteThe Muslims did not then regard him as their enemy.
 Gandhiji said that as the Muslims today generally considered him as their enemy, he was sometimes obliged to speak with restraint. In the Punjab worse things were happening and at first he did not believe the newspaper stories but his subsequent enquiries made him believe that far more excesses than the newspapers reported were being committed in the Punjab. Because it was the doing of a particular community, should he not speak about it? His mission could not be successful by such suppression, he said.
 As far as possible I have refrained from discussing the affairs in Noakhali in my speeches. But whenever I have had occasion to speak about Noakhali, I claim that I have spoken with great restraint. Do the Muslims want that I should not speak about the sins committed by them in Noakhali and that I should only speak about the sins of the Hindus in Bihar? If I do that, I will be a coward. To me the sins of the Noakhali Muslims and the Bihar Hindus are of the same magnitude and equally condemnable.
 Gandhiji thereafter replying to another memorandum, which stated that the signatories had no confidence in the present Ministry, said:
 I told the Hindus of Noakhali, who also expressed lack of confidence in Mr. Shaheed Suhrawardy, that they could not remove Shaheed Saheb from the Ministry as he was returned by the separate electorate system. So long as Shaheed Saheb enjoys the confidence of the community he represents, no one can remove him. Similarly, how can you remove the Ministers when they have been returned by the Hindu electorate? This unfortunate situation has been created by the communal electorate system which, you know, I have always condemned. Dr. Khan Saheblibtech_450_footnotelibtech_451_footnotealso said the same thing the other day that so long as he enjoyed the confidence of the Pathans there was no question of his resignation. Moreover, what will happen if the Ministry goes out? There will again be the rule of the bureaucratic Government. That apart, I can take good work from these Ministers as my relationship with them is most friendly.
 The Bihar Ministers have told me that if I asked them to resign, they would do so. But it would be wrong on my part to ask them to
 resign. I can ask them to do only what is reasonable.
 Referring to the demand that fifty per cent of the officers and constables put in charge of new thanas libtech_452_footnoteshould be Muslims, Gandhiji replied:
 I disapproved of the very same demand of the Noakhali Hindus. This demand cuts across my peace mission. If conceded, this will mean so many small Pakistans and a division of Bihar. After all, wherever you live, you have to live by creating mutual goodwill and friendly relations with your neighbours. Even the Quaid-e-Azam once said that in the Pakistan areas the majority must so behave as to win the confidence of the minority. In the same manner, I am urging upon the Hindus here to win your confidence. Either Pakistan or Hindustan, whichever is established, it must be based on justice and fair play.
 Referring to another demand that the Muslims may be allowed to resettle in certain exclusive areas, Gandhiji said:
You cannot force the Government to keep you in certain
 exclusive areas. Could I tell that to Shaheed Saheb for the Noakhali Hindus? I never gave any encouragement to the Noakhali Hindus for such a move. I told the Hindus of Noakhali that if they were afraid, they could go anywhere if they got compensation. And why should the Government not pay compensation when they got the properties? Similarly, I will tell you to go anywhere provided you get adequate compensation. But I must tell you that it is not my heart’s desire. Leaving your homestead in such a manner is nothing but cowardice. If the Government is not prepared to pay compensation, I should say it is unworthy of them and the Government cannot refuse it. Moreover, if the Ministers who have been returned by the Hindu votes say that the Hindus here have gone beyond control, it is better for them to consume themselves in the flames of the Hindu rage than to continue in office. The Government has to do justice and cannot afford injustice in any manner.
 Referring thereafter to the Muslim grievances regarding the reported appointment of Mr. Justice Reuben to conduct the Bihar Riots Enquiry, Gandhiji said, the memorandum suggested that the Muslims had no faith in Mr. Reuben. But they never suggested whom they wanted. To hold anyone as a suspect simply because he was a non-Muslim was not right. Personally he would have liked the Judge to be a Muslim provided he was acceptable to all. Unfortunately in the vitiated atmosphere of
 
 the times, Hindus did not trust the Muslims and the Muslims the Hindus.
 We must have faith in some non-Muslim such as Mr. Justice Reuben. There is no harm in the one-man Commission.  If  the Muslims want, they can submit a panel of names from amongst which the commission should be appointed. Then I can inform the authorities. I am not one of those who would refuse to do anything simply because the League wants it. Truth alone should be our criterion, no matter who utters it.
 With regard to the demand of restoration and finding out of abducted women, Gandhiji said:
Since my arrival in Bihar I have been telling all those Muslims
 who told me about the abducted girls to give me the names and the family connections of such girls in order to help find out if they were still alive. But till now not one name has been submitted to me. I again ask you to submit the names of the unfortunate girls.
 In the meeting . . . was also present Mahant Bhagwat Das, M.L.A, against whom Muslims brought forward charges that he infuriated the Hindu mob during the riots. Bhagwat Das then stood up and told Gandhiji that he was innocent and asked the Muslims to bring forward specific instances to prove the charges.
 It was further alleged that he was related to a notorious dacoit. The member of the Assembly denied that he was related to the dacoit in question. As for the allegations against him, he was prepared to face an inquiry by a body of Muslim Leaguers themselves. If they found him guilty, he would submit to any punishment. Even otherwise, he would carry out Gandhiji’s orders.
 Gandhiji remarked that if the dacoit referred to was still at large, every effort should be made to arrest him and all should co-operate with the Government to that end. Gandhiji said:
It is a challenge to the Government. If the Government fails to
arrest the culprits it will stand discredited.
 Turning to the member of the Assembly in question, he told him that a special responsibility rested upon him, he being a member from the locality. If the Muslims suspected him of complicity in the riots, he should resign his seat even though the suspicion against him was unfounded. To the Muslims Gandhiji said that they should seek God’s truth only, prove their charges and if they could not be proved, unreservedly withdraw them.

   TALK WITH MUSLIM REFUGEES AND VILLAGE 		REPRESENTATIVESlibtech_453_footnote  
 March 28, 1947
 Gandhiji agreed with them that where the Muslims had in panic sold their property at ridiculously cheap prices they should be able to get the same back at those very rates. Police outposts should be opened at places where looting and destruction of property was still going on. An inquiry should be held into the conduct of the officers who were guilty of gross neglect of their duty during the disturbances, and those against whom the charges were established should be dismissed. It was further suggested to Gandhiji that attention should be paid to the irresponsible and communal-minded section of the Congress. Gandhiji replied that unlike the Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha the Congress was meant to serve all. If it belied its nationalist character, it would destroy itself.
 QUESTION: Does the experience that you have had and the atmosphere that you find around you lend you any hope of success in your mission of re-establishing lost confidence between the Hindus and Muslims?
GANDHIJI: Man can only try. The result is in the hands of God.
 Addressing the village representatives, Gandhiji exhorted them to cleanse their hearts. If they told him they were innocent, he would not believe them. If a single Hindu had committed the crime, they were all responsible for it. Could he reassure the Muslims on their behalf, he asked, that the realization of their sin had been brought home to them and their hearts had been thoroughly cleansed by genuine repentance? If, on the other hand, they felt that in butchering the Muslims they had done the right thing, they should say so plainly, so that he might know exactly where he stood and decide his future course of action accordingly. For, he had sworn to “do or die” in Bihar.

   TALK WITH CONGRESS WORKERSlibtech_454_footnote  
 March 28, 1947
 
 QUESTION: It is being said that Congressmen have taken quite an active part in the riots and there is an increasing tendency among the workers to take bribes.
GANDHIJI: I do not know whom I shall hold responsible for this.
 My faith in God, however, is not a whit shaken by it, rather it is strengthened. These incidents have shown me the persons I trust in their true colours. I will not be losing anything if they prove to be false, because they will be shunned wherever they go. I am not anyone’s master, I am only an humble servant. When the dawn of independence is on the horizon, our people are indulging in such madness.
 Q. The Muslims who fled their homes are trying to sell their properties at cheap rates and the Hindus naturally want to buy them. Should they do so?
G. Honesty demands that the deal should be fair. The Hindus
 should pay the Muslims a fair price for their properties. As a matter of fact, instead of buying, they should hold them in trust.
 Q. Should we ask the Hindus not to buy their properties?
 G. Yes. But it should not develop into a boycott as in Noakhali. We should not take advantage of the Muslims’ distress.

   TALK WITH POLICEMENlibtech_455_footnote  
 JEHANABAD,
 March 28, 1947
 
 Gandhiji told them that their strike was ill-advised and there was no convincing argument in favour of continuing it. They were not mere wage-earners. They were members of an essential service. Limbs of the law were expected to put duty before self-interest. If they continued their strike until their demand was conceded, it would jeopardize their case. They should, therefore, immediately and unconditionally call off the strike. The Government of the day was their own and there was no loss of dignity in surrendering to it. But they should follow his advice only if their leaders
 accepted it. While they belonged to their organization, loyalty demanded that they should consult their leaders before they acted upon his advice.
 Gandhiji deprecated the growing rift between the Hindu and the Muslim policemen and told them that Hindu policemen should treat their Muslim colleagues as their brothers. Their conduct should be such that both Hindus and Muslims should have equal faith in them and the Muslims should not feel that for their protection they needed Muslim policemen and vice versa.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_456_footnote       ALLAHGANJ, 
  March 	28, 1947    Gandhiji 	began by saying that he had passed a very full and heavy day. The 	day was begun with a long meetinglibtech_457_footnotewith the members of 	the local Muslim League at the bungalow of Mr. Azharul Haq, local 	League leader. He was with them for over an hour and had a hearty 	chat with them answering all kinds of questions. Then he had a 	meetinglibtech_458_footnoteat 	his residential quarters with Hindus and Muslims belonging to 	JEHANABAD 	and the surrounding villages. He had then a meetinglibtech_459_footnotewith the 	Congressmen which included members of the various Congress 	Committees. Later he met the members of the local Hindu Mahasabha. 	Finally he had a heart-to-heart talklibtech_460_footnotewith over 25 	members of the police force on strike. Then at half past three again 	he visited the villages of Malathi, Gangasagar, Bola and Allahganj, 	in which Muslims had suffered badly.  Referring 	to his visit to the villages, Gandhiji said that naturally he was 	full of topics on which he wanted to speak and bespeak their 	attention. He was sorry to say that Hindu repentance was not open 	and sincere enough to inspire confidence among the Muslims. He had 	told the afternoon meeting that it was open to the representative 	Hindus who were present at the meeting to disabuse the Muslims of 	their suspicion. He was sorry to say that not one Hindu got up to 	give the needed assurance. He had not the heart, therefore, to ask 	his Muslim hearers whether they (the Hindus) had cleansed their 	hearts. Muslims were the injured party in Bihar and it was not open 	to anyone to expect a satisfactory answer from them unless the 	guilty Hindu party had led the way        
 by repentance. There were, yet, ring-leaders like Mathura Singh at large and successfully evading arrest. There was, therefore, little cause for wonder if the Muslims were afraid to return to their respective villages. Gandhiji said that he could not help feeling that the culprit could not long remain at large if the Hindu population did not give him shelter. He asked Mathura Singh’s friends and sympathizers to advise him to discover himself and face the consequences of his action. He would also like to tell him that it was no act of bravery for him to evade arrest. He was thus rendering a disservice to himself, his religion and his country. He suggested to the Congressmen, in whose midst the inhumanities were enacted, that they could not absolve themselves from the guilt, unless they made every effort to induce all the culprits to come out into the open and to wash their guilt as publicly as they had committed the crimes.
 Continuing, Gandhiji said that he had visited a mosque in the village Bola which was damaged during the disturbances. He was told that on the day of Holi the mosque was again desecrated by some villagers who played Holi inside the mosque premises. If it was true, Gandhiji said, it was undoubtedly a notice given by them to the Muslims not to enter their homes even when they were rebuilt, not dare to visit the mosque. If this reported desecration on Holi day was a fact, it was a bad omen for the Hindus, for Bihar and for the whole country. He regretted the reported action of the local Hindus and warned them to respect all places of worship alike. He called upon the culprits to confess. But, Gandhiji regretted, new parties and new leaders had risen who believed in all sorts of crimes and perhaps nobody was prepared to listen to him. He recalled the theme of today’s bhajan and prayed to God for help and hoped Bihar would come out of the difficulty now facing the province.
 Gandhiji went on to say that he had heard at the Muslim League meeting in the morning and at the meeting of the Hindus and the Muslims in the afternoon that Mahant Bhagwat Das who was a member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly was himself a participator in the crime and was himself present at both the meetings. The speaker advised him whilst he was under suspicion to give up his membership. He was glad to say that Mahant Bhagwat Das, without a moment’s hesitation, welcomed the advice and promised at once to act up to it. He also added that Bhagwat Das was in no way a participator directly or indirectly in the crime and that he was quite ready to face  an open, impartial enquiry to be made by the Muslim League itself. If it was a sincere declaration, Gandhiji said, it was certainly a refreshing thing at a time when there was no real sign of sincere sorrow and repentance on the part of the Hindus in the affected areas. This he was obliged to say in spite of welcome letters of repentance to which he had made reference at the previous evening’s meeting.
 His attention has been drawn, Gandhiji said, to the fact that the Government lorry which had accompanied him in his tour was forcibly boarded by passers-by as if they had a right to travel in it even as the authorized occupants. He was sorry at the unmanly exhibition of authority and lawlessness. Such licence could not be tolerated even in the freest country in the world. Those who defied the law were digging the
 grave of Indian independence before it was in their hands.
 Gandhiji fervently appealed to all Bihar and through Bihar to the Indian people not to plunge the country into a turmoil in the prelude to the dawn of freedom over this land which he called the arunodaya of the new age. Gandhiji warned the nation to awaken before the day of freedom dawned, just as all good men were up from slumber and prayed before sunrise.
 Gandhiji set at rest all speculation about his visit to Delhi in response to Lord Mountbatten’s invitation by announcing that he was leaving Bihar for three or four days. Gandhiji said he was determined to stay in Bihar and see the work he had taken up through and no man could prevent him from doing it. God alone could keep him away if He so desired.libtech_461_footnote

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_465_footnote  
 
 
PATNA,
  March 	29, 1947  At 	the outset Gandhiji told the audience that he would be leaving for 	Delhi the next day and hoped to return in about four or five days.  Gandhiji 	then feelingly referred to the death on the previous evening of 	Prof. Abdul Bari, President of the Bihar Provincial Congress 	Committee, under tragic circumstances. Prof. Bari was a disciple and 	co-worker of Dr. Rajendra Prasad. Dr. Rajendra Prasad has built for 	himself a unique and undisputed position and influence in the 	province by his service and sacrifice. Prof. Bari had also by his 	service in the cause of the workers in Jamshedpur and other places 	endeared himself to the people and risen to occupy the position of 	the President of the Provincial Congress Committee. A fearless 	fighter, Prof. Bari was with the Congress during the different 	phases of its struggle for freedom.  Gandhiji 	referred to his visit 	earlier in the day to 	Prof. Bari’s house to 	console the members 	of the 	bereaved family and 	ask them not to grieve 	and to 	hearten them 	for the work that had 	specially descended upon 	the weak shoulders of 	his children. 	Gandhiji said 	that as he entered 	the house he 	was struck 	with its simplicity 	and the 	simple life Prof. Bari 	had led. 	The house 	was located 	in an ordinary 	narrow lane and what 	he saw 	inside the 	house fully bore out 	what everyone had 	said about Prof. Bari, 	that he 	was a 	poor man 	and that though 	he had opportunities 	he scrupulously 	maintained his integrity 	as far 	as public 	finances were concerned. At 	a time when the 	administration of the 	country was 	in the 	Congress hands and 	crores of 	rupees had 	to be 	administered, men 	of Prof. 	Bari’s honesty would have been of 	invaluable help. He 	had hoped 	on his return 	from the third 	tour just finished, to be 	more closely associated 	with him and to make 	an effective 	appeal to him 	to modify, 	if not 	altogether get 	rid of, 	his short temper which 	went ill with 	the very 	high office, in 	fact the 	highest in 	the province 	of Bihar, 	especially when there was 	a nationalist 	ministry at the 	head of 	affairs which naturally 	had to 	be influenced by 	the premier 	provincial Congress 	organization. Gandhiji 	said that he had had full 	faith in Prof. 	Bari and had known 	that his 	word carried 	great weight with him. 	But God had willed 	otherwise and 	He had 	deprived Bihar of 	the great 	service of a 	very brave 	man with the heart 	of a 	fakir. But 	men like 	Bari never died, and it 	was for those 	who remained 	to carry 	on the 	noble work 	he had left behind.  Gandhiji 	then referred to the circumstances of Prof. Bari’s death and said 	that    
 in an unfortunate altercation that had ensued between him and one Gurkha member of the anti-smuggling force and a former member of the Indian National Army, the latter shot him. He warned the audience that there was no politics of any kind in the death and that it would be wrong and unjustified to associate the whole I. N. A. organization with the death of Prof. Bari because of what one single individual did.

   INTERVIEW WITH LORD MOUNTBATTENlibtech_473_footnote  
 April 1, 1947
 Gandhiji asked the Viceroy if Manulibtech_474_footnotecould in the meantime roam about the garden so that they could proceed with their talk uninterrupted.
 “Certainly”, replied the Viceroy. Then addressing Manu he added: “All this is yours; we are only trustees. We have come to make it over to you.” Gandhiji put in laughing:
You can search her person for any hidden arms.
 “I am perfectly satisfied there can be no need for that in a disciple of yours,” replied the Viceroy with a smile.
 The Viceroy told Gandhiji that it had always been the British policy not to yield anything to force, but the Mahatma’s non-violence had won. They had decided to quit as a result of India’s non-violent struggle. Towards the close, on being invited to do so, Gandhiji placed before the astonished Viceroy his solution to the Indian deadlock.libtech_475_footnote
 He reiterated what he had said often before, that he did not mind Jinnah or the Muslim League turning the whole of India into Pakistan, provided it was done by appeal to reason and not under threat of violence. But while he had previously held that this could be properly done only after the British had quitted, and while in principle he still adhered to that view, the crux of his present proposal was that he was now prepared under Mountbatten’s umpireship—not as Viceroy but as man—to invite Jinnah to form a government of his choice at the centre and to present his Pakistan plan for acceptance even before the transfer of power. The Congress could
 1947
 give its whole-hearted support to the Jinnah Government. At the same time since the Muslim League would now be the Government, it would have no further excuse for continuing the movements of organized lawlessness, which it had launched in some of the provinces. These must be called off. Further, since the Viceroy had declared that  he was out to do justice only and nothing would be yielded to force, if the League did not accept the offer, the same offer mutatis mutandis should be made to the Congress. The old policy of trying to please both the parties must be given up.
 Gandhiji told the Viceroy that the system of British policy of “divide and rule” had brought about a situation in which the only alternative to a continuation of the British rule, which they had found was no longer feasible, was to accept the logic of the “Quit India” demand and retire unconditionally, leaving India to her fate. The role of peace–maker in the “communal triangle” which they had themselves helped to create was not for them.libtech_476_footnote

   DISCUSSION AT INTER-ASIAN RELATIONS 		CONFERENCE libtech_477_footnote  
 April 1, 1947
 The Azerbaijan delegate, Mr. Yousotoff, who was presiding at the Plenary Session, requested Gandhiji to say a few words.
 Gandhiji replied that he would be attending the closing session of the Conference on April 2 and would speak then. For the present, he would answer any questions that the members might like to put to him.
 In answer to a question whether he believed in the theory of one world and whether it would succeed under the present conditions, Gandhiji declared:
I would not like to live in this world if it is not to be one world.
Certainly I should like to see this dream realized in my lifetime.
 I hope that all the representatives who have come here from the different Asian countries will strive their level best to have only one world. They will have to think out ways and means for achieving this goal.
If you work with fixed determination, there is no doubt that in
 and 10,000 visitors, had been inaugurated on March 23, 1947, at the Red Fort by Jawaharlal Nehru.
 The report in Harijan under the title “Strive for One World”, has been collated
 with the version in The Hindu.
 
 our own generation we will certainly realize this dream.
 Dr. Han Liwu from China asked him his views on the proposal to set up an Asian institute. Gandhiji replying said:
The question is certainly very nice. Let me confess my
 ignorance. I have really to apologize to you. Pandit Nehru had asked me long before this Conference was scheduled to take place whether it would at all be possible for me to attend it. It has proved to be a much more important conference than it was expected to be. I was obliged to say at that time that I was very sorry and would not be able to come.libtech_478_footnotelibtech_479_footnoteWhen Lord Mountbatten, the new Viceroy, invited me to meet him, however, I could not say ‘No’. It would have been foreign to my nature to do so. The Viceroy had already told me that the credit for bringing me to Delhi during the Asian Conference was really his. And I told the Viceroy: “I am your prisoner. But I am also Pandit Nehru’s prisoner, for, after all, he is your Vice-President !”
Through correspondence I know almost all parts of the world
 and naturally, therefore, of Asia, though I know very few of you personally—perhaps none of you. I am doubtful whether I can say anything useful but the question is one after my heart. Some portions of the question put to me now were discussed by Pandit Nehru yesterday. It is a great event that for the first time in our history such a conference takes place on the Indian soil. I am sorry that I have to refer to the conditions that we see today. We do not know how to keep peace between ourselves. We have so many differences which  we cannot settle between ourselves in a humane and friendly manner. We think we must resort to the law of the jungle. It is an experience which   I would not like you to carry to your respective countries. I would instead like you to bury it here.
 India is now on the threshold of complete independence. India wants to be independent of everybody who wants to own this country. We do not want a change of masters. We want to be masters on our own soil, though I am not quite sure how it will come about. All that we know is that we should do our duty and leave the results in the hands of God and not in the hands of man. Man is supposed to be the maker of his destiny. It is only partly true. He can make his destiny, only in so far as he is allowed by the Great Power which overrides all out intentions, all our plans and carries out His own plans.
I call that Great Power not by the name of Allah, not by the
 name of Khuda or God but by the name of Truth. For me, Truth is God and Truth overrides all our plans. The whole truth is only embodied within the heart of that Great Power—Truth. I was taught from my early days to regard Truth as unapproachable—something that you cannot reach. A great Englishman taught me to believe that God is unknowable. He is knowable but knowable only to the extent that our limited intellect allows.
 You, gentlemen, have come here from different parts of Asia, and having come with eagerness and zest you should all have yearly meetings or two-yearly or three-yearly conferences. You should carry away sweet memories of the meetings and make every effort to build the great edifice of Truth.
 All the Asian representatives have come together. Is it in order to wage a war against Europe, against America or against non- Asiatics? I say most emphatically ‘No’. This is not India’s mission. I am free to confess that I will feel extremely sorry if India, having won independence through essentially and predominantly non-violent means, was going to use that independence for the suppression of the other parts of the world. Europeans have hitherto exploited different races inhabiting this vast continent called Asia. It will be a sorry thing if we go away from this Conference without a fixed determination that Asia shall live and live as free as any Western nation. I just wanted to say that conferences like the present one should meet regularly, and if you ask me where, India is the place. You will forgive me for this partiality for India.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 NEW DELHI,
 April 1, 1947
 Today as soon as Manu Gandhi uttered the first word of the Kalma from the Koran a young man stood up, marched right up to the stage where Gandhiji sat and said, “You go away from here. This is a Hindu temple where we will not allow a Muslim prayer. You have been repeatedly telling this thing to us but our mothers and sisters continue to be slaughtered. We cannot tolerate it any longer.” Gandhiji told him:
You are free to go. If you do not want to pray let the others do
 
 it. This place does not belong to you. This is not the right way.libtech_480_footnote
 You did not do the right thing. You forcibly removed the young man from the meeting. You should not have done such a thing. It would give him a sense of triumph. He was very excited. He did not wish to listen to the prayer. But I know that you all wish to listen to it.  I do not wish to hold the prayer in spite of protests. Now I intend to give up the rest of the prayer. You are all familiar with the prayer I offer. You have heard it even before I went to Noakhali. In my sequence of prayers, the Muslim prayer is followed by the  Parsi prayer. After that this girl would have sung to you a bhajan in her melodious voice and then there would have been Ramdhun. But now I am leaving out the Parsi prayer and also the Ramdhun. Auz-o-Billahi is the beginning of one of the verses of the Koran. You think that uttering this expression is an insult to Hinduism. But I am a true sanatani Hindu. My Hinduism tells me that along with the Hindu prayer I should also offer the Muslim prayer and the Parsi and Christian prayers. True Hinduism lies in offering prayers of all religions because only he is a good Hindu who is also a good Muslim and a good Parsi. The young man said that this was a Hindu temple and such prayers could not be held here. But that is wild talk. This temple belongs to the Bhangis. Even a single Bhangi can throw me out of this place if he so desires. But these people love me. They know that I am a Hindu. Jugal Kishore Birla, on the other hand, is my brother. He is a big man in terms of money but he regards me an elder. He has put me up here because he considers me a pious HIndu. He also takes me to the big temple built by him. If in spite of all this the young man insists that I should go away and I cannot pray here, it is merely his arrogance. But you should have won him over with love. You threw him out by force. What is the point in offering prayers by resorting to force? The young man was in a rage and in his anger was talking wild things. It was out of such talk that all those things happened in the Punjab. This rage is what starts all the fanaticism.
 The shlokas just recited by this girl say that when a man broods on objects of the senses—that is, all the five senses—he is caught up in craving. Then he is possessed by wrath which leads to stupefaction,
 
 i.e., insanity.libtech_481_footnote
 Driven by such frenzy the simple folk of Bihar have indulged in such acts as make me hang my head down in shame. In the same mad fury the people of Noakhali indulged in excesses. But the law of the jungle was more in evidence in Bihar than in Noakhali and it was even more so in the Punjab.
 If you are true Hindus, you should not act in such a manner. If in a meeting something is being said which we do not like to hear we must get up and leave the meeting. There is no need to shout and make a row. Moreover, this is a matter of religion. Leave alone religious discussion this man would not even allow people to pray. Prayers should not be disturbed as was done by this young man. Such acts help no one.
 None of those who have died in the Punjab will ever come back. Ultimately all of us have to go the same way. If is true that these people met their death by being slaughtered whereas others die of cholera or in some other way. He who is born is destined to die. In being born there is, to an extent, some human responsibility, but in the matter of dying, none but God has any hand. Death  cannot  be  avoided on any account. Death is our companion, our  friend.  If people have died with courage, they have lost nothing. Rather, they have gained something. But the great problem is how to deal with those who committed these murders. True, to err is human. After all man is but a bundle of errors. But we ought to rectify the errors. God will not overlook our acts. When we go to Him He will look into our hearts. He knows our hearts. If there is a change of heart in us, he will pardon all our lapses.
 I have many friends in the Punjab who call themselves my devoted followers. But who am I that they should describe themselves as such? All these friends insist that since I have already come as far as Delhi I should go over to the Punjab at least for one night, so as to comfort the people there. It would take only a few hours if I fly. But how can I go at somebody’s bidding? I shall go there only at God’s bidding or at the bidding of my own heart. I did not go to Noakhali at someone else’s call. Before leaving this place I had said that I was going there because my heart urged me to do so. People had been for long asking me to go to Bihar but I had not gone there at anyone’s call. I went when Dr. Mahmud Saheb wrote to me that my going there would alone clear the minds of the Biharis.
 
 Bihar is a province where Hindus and Muslims can live together [in peace]. But there too women and children have been subjected to outrages no less violent. Blind with fury, people killed innocent children; they slaughtered the womenfolk and threw the bodies into the wells. I am not talking in the air. All these are facts that can be proved by evidence. After that the Muslims are bound to say that they would not live there. But once they are assured that they would not be treated like that again, they would come back. The Bihari Muslims had nearly come to appreciate this ; so much so that if we could have reassured them, I was confident that the Muslims who had fled to Asansol and Sind would have come back. They were on the point of returning. But now, should the atrocities in the Punjab be avenged in Bihar? Then, will it be repeated in Madras? And where will this end? Will all of us become barbarous in this way? The Congress fought a non-violent battle against the British. Should we now start killing our own brethren? True, Muslims are perpetrating atrocities, but should we also do the same? Was there an act of atrocity that the British did not commit?
 But now the British are going. The Viceroy told me that they had never retreated, but they were leaving India, as a result of her non- violent struggle. You might say that they are doing it for  show, because in any case they had got to go. But, if anyone comes to us with honest intentions, why should we interpret his honesty as wickedness? I have learnt to accept honesty on the face of it till I have experience to the contrary. Just at the moment of the departure of the British should we present the spectacle of pleading for the retention of their army although they are leaving? In the Punjab today we are protected solely by them. But can we call it protection? I wish we could protect ourselves even if only a handful of us survived. Let us not be afraid of dying. If we are to be killed, would we not rather be killed by our Muslim brothers? Would a brother cease to be a brother because he has changed his religion? Moreover, do we not indulge in the same acts as they do? What have we not done to the women in Bihar? The Hindus have done it, which means I have done it. It is a matter of shame. Do you think I should hurl two abuses in return for one? But that is exactly what both the Hindus and the Muslims are secretly doing and they are possessed by a mad frenzy.
 Here is Badshah Khan sitting right beside me. Who can remove him from here? How much prayer did I leave unfinished because of
 that young man? I did so because I wanted to demonstrate, I wanted to proclaim to one and all that I would be a good Hindu only if I am a good Parsi, a good Muslim. Would it be religious to abuse other religions? For me, there is nothing like different religions.
 All these people who have come from all over Asialibtech_482_footnotetalk very lovingly to Jawaharlal. They are all very pleased with him. By the grace of God, we have a gem of a man in our midst who wants to embrace the whole world. Should we not maintain peace if only to honour him?
 Now let me say a few things about the Viceroy. I was with him yesterday for more than two hours, and therefore could not come for the prayers. Fortunately the girl started the prayers as I had instructed her. Today also I talked with the Viceroy for two hours.libtech_483_footnoteHe said that he was making an honest effort. He assured me that he was the last Viceroy. He said he never wanted to come to India. He wanted to be on the seas but he came here because he was prevailed upon.
 He was sent here when the Labour Government of Great Britain decided to quit India, since he belongs to the royal family. The British want to depart from India with grace. He said he was eager to hand over this country even to a single Parsi if he came forward to take it, not to mention a Hindu or a Muslim. Why should I not listen to one who comes to me with such honest intentions? The British have done us enough harm in the past. But Lord Mountbatten has done us no harm. He says that he would like to be a servant right from today if it were possible. But it is not proper that he should run away while we are fighting with each other. He, after all, belongs to a brave race. Why should he run away? He is thinking of the manner in which he should leave the country. He is making good efforts. He is proceeding honourably. If we too proceed accordingly, what has never before happened will happen now. If anyone wants to accommodate a fellow who would not conduct himself honourably but would act barbarously, let him learn from me how to do it. I am a prisoner of the Viceroy till Friday. Jawahar also wants to detain me here. After three days I shall tell you everything. I do not want to hide anything. But what can possibly happen? Whatever the Congress decides will be done; nothing will be according to what I say. Mr writ runs no more. If it did the tragedies in the Punjab, Bihar and Noakhali would not
 
 have happened. No one listens to me any more. I am a small man. True, there was a time when mine was a big voice. Then everyone obeyed what I said; now neither the Congress nor the Hindus nor the Muslims listen to me. Where is the Congress today? It is  disintegrating. I am crying in the wilderness. Today everyone can forsake me but God will not. He has His devotee tested. An English poemlibtech_484_footnotelibtech_485_footnotedescribes God as the “Hound of Heaven”. He is the retriever of dharma, i.e., He seeks out dharma. It would be enough if He hears me. When God rules your hearts you will do only as He bids. We should therefore behave like rational creatures. We ought not to let loose our tongues at the slightest provocation.

   TALK WITH MANU GANDHI  
 April 1, 1947
 It is here that my non-violence will undergo its true test. But you are in charge of conducting the prayer. The purity and sincerity with which you conduct the prayer is sure to have its impact on the general public. The people will learn a new lesson through it. Your responsibility in this regard is indeed great. And if the recitation of Ramanama is from the heart Rama will himself inspire right- mindedness in all. I have no doubt about it.

   A LETTER  
 April 2, 1947
 I have come here but I could see the Sardar only for a few minutes. His field of work has grown so vast that I do not like to engage him in talks. I would rather not encroach upon his time even to know his views about me and about Harijan. When I look at the work-schedule of the Cabinet I feel as if I had more time than they. It looks surprising, yet it is true.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,      DELHI,  April 	2, 1947 
  	If there is anybody who intends today to object to the prayers, as 	was done yesterday, I should like to be informed so that I may not 	begin the prayers at all. I do not wish to hold the prayers in the 	face of opposition by anyone.  Two 	persons stood up and said, “If you wish to have your prayers you 	should hold them in the grounds outside this Hindu temple.” GANDHIJI: 	This temple belongs to Bhangis. I too am a Bhangi. It  	would be a different matter if the Trustees object. I shall hold the 	prayers in this very place if you would let me do so.  A 	YOUNG MAN: This temple 	belongs to the public. We have seen what has    
 happened in the Punjab. We shall certainly not allow you to hold the prayers.
 GANDHIJI: I do not wish to enter into an argument. Let me tell you with due respect that you can’t represent the Bhangis. I am a Bhangi by choice. I have removed night-soil. If I ask you, you will not be able to do so. Even so if you object I shall not hold the  prayers.
 “We wish to hear the prayers. We want to have the prayers”, people shouted.
 GANDHIJI: Among these thousands of people you are the only two persons who are putting an obstruction. If does not behove you. I know you are full of anger. I shall have the prayers, but not unless you calm yourselves and try to understand.
 The young man shouted: “If you want to recite the verses of the Gita in a mosque, will the Muslims allow you to do so? We have witnessed so much in the Punjab.”
GANDHIJI: It is not necessary to shout. You are not protecting
 Hindu dharma by doing so, in fact you are murdering it. I am not postponing the prayer out of fear. If anybody wants to stop me once I have started the prayers I shall not stop even if I am killed. And you will see I shall be reciting  Rama Rahim  and  Krishna Karimlibtech_487_footnotewhen I breathe my last. I have told you that I am a Bhangi, a Christian, a Muslim, besides of course being a Hindu. How can you stop me when Badshah Khan is here with me? But you may stop me, even a child can do so.
 YOUNG MAN: Go to the Punjab.
 GANDHIJI: What shall I do by going there? I am straining every nerve to do what service I can for the Punjab, Bihar and Noakhali even while remaining here.
 Some persons tried to remove the young man. GANDHIJI: Please do not push him. Be patient.
 YOUNG MAN: Give us four minutes, we would like to talk to you.
 GANDHIJI I don’t have the time and I don’t want to enter into an argument. I would only urge upon you respectfully to tell me in the affirmative or negative [whether I should hold the prayer or not].
 YOUNG MAN: We shall not allow you to hold the prayers.
 GANDHIJI: Everyone should remain seated peacefully. I am going. No one should molest these persons. You may consider this to be your triumph but is it so? Is it bravery to stab anybody in the back? I must say that by doing so you are murdering Hinduism. You must try to think and understand. I will put the same question to you tomorrow and if you object to the prayers I shall go away.

   SPEECH AT INTER-ASIAN RELATIONS CONFERENCE libtech_488_footnote  
 April 2, 1947 I do not think that I should apologize to you for having to  speak in a foreign tongue. I wonder if this loud speaker carries my
voice to the farthest end of this vast audience. If some of those who
 are far away are unable to hear what I may say, it will be the fault of the loud speaker.
 I was going to tell you that I do not wish to apologize. I dare not. You cannot understand the provincial language which is my mother ton-gue. I do not want to insult you by speaking in my own language (Guja-rati). Our national speech in Hindustani. I know that it will be a long time before it can be made into an international speech. For international commerce, undoubtedly, English occupies the first place. I used to hear that French was the language of diplomacy. I was told when I was young that if I wanted to go from one end of Europe to the other, I must try to pick up French. I tried to learn French in order that I may be able to make myself understood. There is a rivalry between French and English. Having been taught English I have naturally to resort to that language.
 I was wondering as to what I was to say to you. I wanted to collect my thoughts but, let me confess to you, I had no time. Yet I had promised yesterday that I would try to say a few words. While I was coming with Badshah Khan I asked for a little piece of paper and pencil. I got a pen instead of a pencil. I tried to scribble a few words. You will be sorry to hear from me that that piece of paper is not by my side though I remember what I wanted to say.
 
 You, friends, have not seen the real India and you are  not meeting in conference in the midst of real India. Delhi, Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Lahore—all these are big cities and are, therefore, influenced by the West.
 I then thought of a story. It was in French and was translated for me by an Anglo-French philosopher. He was an unselfish man. He befriended me without having known me because he always sided with the minorities. I was not then in my own country. I was not only in a hopeless minority but in a despised minority, if the Europeans in South Africa will forgive me for saying so. I was a coolie lawyer. At that time we had no coolie doctors, not coolie lawyers. I was the first in the field. You know perhaps what is meant by the word coolie.
 This friend—his mother was a French woman and his father an Englishman—said: “I want to translate for you a French story. There were three scientists who went out from France in search of truth. They went to different parts of Asia. One of them found his way to India. He began to search. He went to the socalled cities of those times—naturally this was before British occupation, before even the Moghul period. He saw the socalled high-caste people, men and women, and he felt at a loss. Finally, he went to a humble cottage in a humble village. That was the cottage of a Bhangi and there he found the truth that he was in search of.”
 If you realy want to see India at its best [sic], you have to find it in the humble Bhangi homes of such villages. There are 7,00,000 of such villages and 38 crores of people inhabit them.
 If some of you see the villages, you will not be fascinated by the sight. You will have to scratch below the dung heap. I do not say that they ever were heavenly places. Today they are really dung-heaps. They were not like that before. What I say is not from history but from what I have seen myself I have travelled from one end of India to the other and have seen the miserable specimen of humanity with lustreless eyes. They are India. In these humble cottages, in the midst of these dung-heaps, are to be found the humble Bhangis in whom you find the concentrated essence of wisdom.
 Again, I have learnt from books—books written by English historians. We read books written in English by English historians but we do not write in our own mother tongue or in the national language—Hindustani. We study our history through English books rather than through the originals. That is the cultural conquest which
 India has undergone.
 Stating that wisdom had come to the West from the East, Gandhiji said:
 The first of these wise men was Zoroaster. He belonged to the East. He was followed by the Buddha who belonged to the East— India. Who followed the Buddha? Jesus, who came from the East. Before Jesus was Moses who belonged to Palestine though he was born in Egypt. After Jesus came Mohammed. I omit any reference to Krishna and Rama and other lights. I do not call them lesser lights but they are less known to the literary world. All the same I do not know of a single person in the world to match these men of Asia. And then what happened? Christianity became disfigured when it went to the West. I am sorry to have to say that. I would not talk any furher.
 I have told you the story in order to make you understand that what you see in the big cities is not the real India. Certainly, the carnage that is going on before our very eyes is a shameful thing. As I said yesterday, do not carry the memory of that carnage beyond the confines of India.
 What I want you to understand is the message of Asia. It is not to be learnt through the Western spectacles or by
 imitating the atom bomb. If you want to give a message to the West, it must be the message of love and the message of truth. I want you to go away with the thought that Asia has to conquer the West through love the truth. I do not want merely to appeal to your heads. I want to capture your hearts.
 Of course, I believe in “one world”. How can I possibly do otherwise, when I became an inheritor of the message of love that these great unconquerable teachers left for us? In this age of democracy, in this age of awakening of the poorest of the poor, you can redeliver this message with the greatest emphasis. You will complete the conquest of the West not through vengeance because you have been exploited, but with real understanding. I am confident that if all of you put your hearts together—not merely heads—to understand the secret of the message these wise men of the East have left to us, and if we really become worthy of that great message, the conquest of the West will be complete. This conquest will be loved by the West itself.
 The West is today pining for wisdom. It is despairing of the multiplication of the atom bomb, because atom bombs mean utter
 
 destruction not merely of the West but of the whole world, as if the prophesy of the Bible was going to be fulfilled and there was to be a perfect deluge. It is up to you to tell world of its wickedness and sin— that is the teaching your teachers and my teachers have taught Asia.

Courtesy: Beladevi Nayyar and Dr. Sushila Nayyar      A TALK libtech_489_footnote    April 	3, 1947  	We must project ourselves in a better light in foreign countries. 	Foreigners observe us with a view to learning something from us. But 	we, in our turn, come under their spell. As a matter of fact we 	should try to impress them with what is our own. For instance, while 	there we should insist on wearing khadi, should ply the charkha 	regularly, abstain from smoking, drinking and taking tea and should 	have vegetarian food if possible. We must live as simply as 	possible, conforming to our way of life. If we do this, we shall be 	able to impress the people there and enhance our country’s glory. 	We should demonstrate to them the advantages of our way of life. 	What is the true meaning of appointing our ambassadors in those 	countries or their ambassadors in our country? It means that these 	ambassadors, through their conduct and manner of dressing and their 	food habits, should reveal their own cultural heritage to the other 	country so that it can benefit from it. Such mutually advantageous 	exchanges would spread friendliness which in turn would promote 	world peace, and this  
 would enable people to live in harmony and peace and make progress. In my opinion this is the basic purpose of appointing ambassadors in every country. No doubt there are distinct  international advantages accruing from this in the commercial and economic spheres, but the most signifi- cant is the former advantage. Hence we must take great care to see that our representatives exhibit no undesirable trait. Then alone would we shine forth and rise from our present backward state. There is a saying in English that if wealth is lost nothing is lost, if health is lost much is lost but if honour is lost everything is lost.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,     NEW DELHI,  April 	3, 1947 
  	Yesterday there were only two or three persons who wanted to stop 	the prayers, but today the matter has gone further.  I  have  	received a letter written by the president of some scavengers’ 	union. It says that I must not stay here. Just look at the ordeal an 	old man like me has to go through. But the president of the 	scavengers’ union here is another person. After all I am a 	scavenger myself and all my scavenger friends here listen to me. I 	have been staying here after consulting them and will continue to 	stay. Moreover, Jugal Kishore Birla is the boss here. He has put me 	up here. When the person who has accommodated me does not ask me to 	leave, why should I go?  	Again today I shall ask you whether I should hold the prayer or not. 	But before that I would like to ask if you have  	understood what I said to you yesterday. If you have, you would have 	realized why I stopped the prayer yesterday. If somebody tells me 	not to hold the prayer or that, if I did, I may not include the 	recitation from the Koran, should I accept defeat and continue the 	prayer? I am not going to give up the prayer even if I have to lose 	my life. Those who stop the prayer in this manner do not advance 	Hinduism but harm it. Yesterday there were only two or three such 	persons ; today there are many. I 	am disturbed by what I heard today. I hope it is not true— 
 namely, that the persons obstructing prayers belong to a big organizationlibtech_490_footnote.
 But those who do physical exercises and drill here  every morning and are members of that organization love me. If they do not want me to stay here there is no point in my staying on. I must not remain here. But I had a talk with their leader. He said that it was not their intention to harm anyone. The Sangh was not formed to oppose anyone. True, they had not accepted my method of non-violence; but they were willing to confine themselves within the Congress discipline. So long as the Congress rules non-violently they would remain peaceful. He thus talked with me very cordially.
 If you still want to stop me, then kindly do not come here from tomorrow. I do not wish to hold prayers in this manner. I am made of different stuff. If I am a Hindu, I am also a Muslim. And the Sikhs are almost Hindus. I have seen the Granth Sahib. In many parts it is Hinduism to the letter—the religion I follow. Hence, with great humility I request you to remain peaceful because I would stop the prayer even at a child’s wish. If you want to recite God’s name by creating a row you would be acting like a devil although you may be uttering the name of God. And I can never do the work of the devil. I am a devotee of God alone.
 Please do not take it as cowardice on my part. Had you been in large numbers and had all of you insisted that I should not hold the prayer, I would certainly have carried on. I would have asked you to cut my throat and continued the prayer. But here in the presence of so many of you, a handful of persons want to stop me. If you suppress them and insist on my continuing the prayer it would be the act of a devil and I cannot follow the devil. He who is God’s enemy is the devil. I cannot co-operate with the devil. My method of resisting is like Rama’s. During the battle between Rama and Ravana Vibhishana asked Rama how he would fight against Ravana without a chariot. Rama then pointed out how one could fight a war with the help of qualities like truthfulness, valour and so on. Rama was a devotee of God and talked like one. I have regarded Rama not as God but as a devotee. Later on from a devotee he came to be regarded as God. Tulsidas too has described Rama as without a body. This One without form pervades all forms. Him we worship. I am a worshipper of this Rama. How can I ever worship Ravana? You may kill me, spit in my
 
 face but I shall go on repeating Rama Rahim and Krishna Karim till my last breath. And even at the moment you shower blows on me I shall not blame you. Nor shall I complain to God whatever may be done to me. I am His devotee. I shall accept His wish.
 But today, even if a child wants me to stop, I shall stop the prayer. I shall leave the place. Please remain seated in silence and do not indulge in arguments. Silence is also a form of prayer, and my prayer is not meant for the world to see. It is for peace of mind, for cleansing the heart. In the present circumstances we cannot cleanse our hearts by praying while they are full of anger. Hence, let us consider silence itself as prayer.
 If people forced me down from all sides, stopped me from praying and under pain of bodily injury I discontinued the prayer it would be irreligion, not religion. It would not cleanse our hearts. What face would I have to go and tell the Hindus of Noakhali not to be afraid and to go on repeating Ramanama? That is why I ask you to understand this peaceful method of mine. How can I carry on the prayer if all of you want to stop me? But I would continue  the Ramdhun and Rama Rahim Krishna Karim, and so on and leave the place if a child wants me to do so.
 Now I ask you to reply ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Do not argue. Shall I conduct the prayer?
 Some thirty persons stood up and said: “Do not hold the prayer, we do not want your prayers.”
 GANDHIJI: Well, so, all of you are against it?
 Two to three hundred persons cried out: “No, all of us are not against it. Do hold the prayer.”
 G. No, there are too many people against it. I am defeated, you have won. Tomorrow more people can raise their hands. Even now your number is considerable. I can hold the prayer, but I have no desire to be killed at your hands. I want to live and work.
 PEOPLE: Not all, only a few are not in favour.
 G. That’s all right, there need not be more ! Even these few can kill me if they want.
 This was followed by shouting from both the sides and there was a great deal of noise. Gandhiji stood at the edge of the dais and said:
Please listen. Do not get so excited. You are all Hindus. A Hindu
 ought to think calmly and speak after great  thought  and consideration. Please go home and think how the wound of the Punjab can be healed. I am also thinking about it as best as I can. But the wound is not going to be healed by getting angry.
 With this Gandhiji finished his speech. But a voice came from the crowd: “Please answer one question before leaving. Why did you stop Ramdhun at Noakhali?libtech_491_footnoteStop it here too and hold your prayers in your room.”
 G. I do not wish to give any answer here. Please leave this place and do not quarrel even after you have left.
 Gandhiji then started to leave. In the meantime the police tried to restore order. This created confusion in the meeting. Then Gandhiji returned to the dais. People asked him to start the prayer. They offered to pacify those  who  were  protesting. They said they would all sit down, and that they were all ready to lay down their lives for him, but he should not abandon the prayer.
 G. If you are going to die let it be on my condition. Allmy life I have been teaching the art of laying down life and learning it myself. If you want to lay down your lives, you should not do it boiling with rage. You should meet death with the strength of coolness. Right now these people are confused. They think that it is only Gandhi who is going about doing all the harm. So, for the present, consider only my silence as my prayer. I know at present everyone’s blood is boiling because of the events in the Punjab. Isn’t my own blood boiling? There is a fire raging even in my heart. I understand the problem of the Punjab fully well. The Punjabis are all my brothers. Right now they are all enraged. They must calm down. The people of Bihar were also angry. I have contained their anger. In the present situation we can make any headway only by containing our anger.
 The police have taken away those few persons. How can I hold the prayer when they have been removed? Let them return to this place and sit here in silence and then we shall all pray together.
 Just now, I am using my energy in thinking how to prevent what is going on. What else? Do you think I visit the Viceroy for dinner parties?libtech_492_footnoteWe are both putting our heads together and trying to find out
 a way. He is more eager to put an end to all this chaos than I am. It is just as well that he should. I request you again to remain quiet. Silence by itself is prayer. I do not like those who protest being stopped by force.
 When Gandhiji turned to go, people stopped him for the third time and said: “Why do you listen to those few persons who are causing obstruction? Actually, they have suffered nothing. It is we who have suffered in the Punjab—who have been wronged. But we are not preventing you. We request you to hold the prayer, if only for some time.”
G. You are right. But you must give them a chance to
understand.
 Some people said: “Will you answer our question?”
 G. You just think. I am an old man. Can I keep standing and talk? I tell even the Viceroy that he should not expect me to talk standing. Do I have all that energy? But God makes me talk. He gives me strength. I am having [high] blood-pressure these days. Still He is pulling me along. Tomorrow I shall talk more provided there is no opposition.
 Let those who are at the root of this opposition at least come to me and talk. If all they want is that I should not stay here I shall go away. There are many people who would have me stay with them. But I am a Bhangi, and am content to put up in the Bhangi Colony. I could even have all this accommodation here. They have only small holes to live in. I cannot stand it. I insist on cleanliness. If God grants me the strength, I shall start living in one of them.
 May God be kind to all and grant independence to India. [From Hindi]

   TALK WITH MANU GANDHI  
 April 4, 1947
 Whatever has been lately happening during the prayer meetings is a measure of my own purity. I shall succeed to the extent that I am pure. The responsibility lies as much on you. The success of my action depends on you. We might have left Noakhali; but the yajna is the same. I am being tested no doubt. But you are being put to a greater test because the person conducting the prayers has his own influence. If there is not the slightest negligence, the frequent bleeding of your nose must stop. You must look after yourself as much as you look after me and my belongings, for you too are one of them. Then alone would you succeed.

   TALK WITH REFUGEESlibtech_498_footnote  
 April 4, 1947
 Q. You tell people to discard arms, but in the Punjab the Muslims kill the Hindus at sight. You have no time even to go to the Punjab. Do you want us to be butchered like sheep?
 GANDHIJI: If all the Punjabis were to die to the last man without killing, the Punjab would become immortal. It is more valiant to get killed than to kill. Of course my condition is that even if we are facing death we must not take up arms against them. But you take up arms and when you are defeated you come to me. Of what help can I be to you in these circumstances? If you cared to listen to me, I could restore calm in the Punjab even from here. One thousand lost their lives of course, but not like brave men. I would have liked the sixteen who escaped by hiding to have come into the open and courted death. More is the pity. What a difference it would have made if they had bravely offered themselves as a non-violent, willing sacrifice! Oppose with ahimsa if you can, but go down fighting by all means if you have

 not the non-violence of the brave. Do not turn cowards.
 There was a time when the most casual remark from me was honoured as a command. Such is not the case today. Man after all is mortal. We are born only to die. Death alone is the true friend of man. [Birth and death] are like the two sides of a coin.
 How did we react in Bihar? Man’s claim to humanity consists in his magnifying his own fault a million times and minimizing others’ faults correspondingly. You ought to know that I have been to villages where death reigned supreme. But in spite of it if I feel like it I would certainly go to the Punjab. But now I am doing the same work from here. I believe I have calmed down Bihar to some extent. Naturally it could be only with God’s grace, without which nothing happens. Why, I had said to none else than Master Tara Singh that I was the true heir of Guru Govind Singh and not be. libtech_499_footnotelibtech_500_footnoteMatters can be mended only if

   TALK WITH EGYPTIAN DELEGATESlibtech_501_footnote  
 April 4, 1947
 One of the delegates asked: “If the British quit, would you still provide them with military facilities in India? And would India adhere to your policy of non- violence after you attain independence? Would you welcome American aid for winning India’s independence?”
 With regard to the first, Gandhiji replied, he could, in certain circum- stances, contemplate the possibility of Britain approaching independent India with that request, as a friendly concession vital to her (Britain’s) existence. He hoped that in that event India would consider the request on its merits, uninfluenced by the memory of past wrongs.
 Of course, today non-violence is no more to be found. But, I hope, when the hurdle of foreign domination is removed everything will be peaceful. I can never think of seeking foreign aid for the attainment of independence. I believe in the dictum a known enemy is better than an unknown one. I do not know what the national policy of India after independence will be. But looking at the present state of

 affairs I do not think I shall live to see it. I would advocate the policy of non-violence as far as we can stretch it. India can contribute substantially towards world peace and progress leading to its reconstruction. All the same, I would say that there are many militant groups in India. India’s history also points in the same direction. Naturally therefore our national policy is sure to tend towards some kind of mild war policy. But I shall certainly die with the hope that my efforts of the last thirty years will not be in vain and that there surely will be a powerful section in the country that would hold steadfastly to the doctrine of true non-violence. You have already met my heir Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and his associates. I hope you have had a discussion with him. But I have faith that a day will come when the world will come to India in search of peace and India and Asia will become the light of the world. I do not know whether I shall survive to witness the day, for I might be consumed in the conflagration that is raging now. But you who are all young men will live to see it. [Laughter.] I tell you all that our ‘Jawahar’, meaning a ‘jewel’, is sure to become one. And he will belong not only to India but will become an ornament of the whole of Asia—of those countries from where you all have come here to cultivate our friendship. However, without your help nothing can be achieved. You have come here from distant lands drawn by your love of him and he deeply appreciates it. I have also had the privilege of meeting you. I sincerely thank you all.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,      NEW DELHI,  April 	4, 1947 
  	Will there be peace today or are you going to repeat what you did 	yesterday and the day before?  Voices 	came from all sides: “It is all quiet today. There will be no 	trouble today. Please hold the prayer.”  Gandhiji 	asked again:  	Are you sure you did not drown a voice or two in your own? Is there 	anyone who wants to oppose? 
 A hand went up. Gandhiji said:
 Very well. In that case, there will be no prayer today also. I shall not hold the prayer so long as there is even one person who refuses to understand or does not voluntarily leave the meeting. It serves no purpose if the police seizes him and takes him away. People should not gang up like this to suppress a smaller group. Even if there are only a few who oppose, they should be persuaded. They should leave the place if they disapprove of anything that happens here. They should not create disturbance. If this one person is convinced of my point and goes away from here I shall hold the prayer. Otherwise he must sit through the prayer in silence.libtech_502_footnote
 Are you all quiet now? Has the gentleman who did not want the prayer to be held, left? I shall appeal to all of you that he should not be threatened or bullied. What will happen to the poor man if the police take him away? Whatever may be his opinion about himself, I shall only pity him. Who will protect him if I do not? If a person calls himself a Hindu or a Muslim and wants to stop me from holding the prayer, why should he be attacked?
 He says that I should not hold the prayer in this temple. But this temple belongs to the scavengers who come to me and complain against outsiders creating trouble in their temple. How can I console my little brothers? I am their elder brother. I am an excellent Bhangi.  I do the external cleaning and clean the latrines, but our hearts too need to be cleansed. A true Bhangi has to do the inner cleaning too, which I am doing. If we do not cleanse our hearts, if we do not get rid of the feeling of high and low, Hinduism is not going to survive. It has survived so far because it is a great religion. It is still alive even though  it is gasping for breath. But if we do not give up the feeling of high and low it would go on weakening even though it is a great religion. Even Dr. Moonjelibtech_503_footnotelibtech_504_footnotehas supported me in this. He has written me a letter saying that even though he does not agree with me on other points— he believes in the training of the sword—he is in complete agreement with me in the matter of removal of untouchability and the feeling of high and low.
 Hence, those who oppose my prayer are destroying Hindu dharma. They should understand that I am as much a Parsi, a
 
 Christian and also a Muslim as I am a Hindu.  What  wonderful meaning is conveyed by Auz-o-Billahi. I have not read the Yajurveda. But a gentleman writes to say that everything is contains is to be found in the Yajurveda. In that case why should you oppose it? Religious sentiment whether expressed in Arabic, Sanskrit or Chinese, is always noble. That is why I would like to ask that gentleman if he has understood my point.
 If he is not a Hindu and belongs to some other religion, let him not attend the prayer. In any case only a few Muslims join my prayer. The Muslims too have been asking me what right I have to recite portions from the Koran. Yet they did not prevent me from doing so in Noakhali. Could they not have stopped me?
 But no one who belongs to Hinduism can have reason to complain. We have 108 upanishads. One of them is the Allopanishad. The wonderful thing about Hinduism is that it assimilates people from outside. But its one great limitation is untouchability or the feeling of high and low. This poison has spread in it. It can survive only if the poison is removed. These people ntalk of saving Hinduism with the help of the sword. They carry swords while doing their drills. Why? For killing [their oppoents]? This is not the way to advance Hinduism.
 A religion grows through truth alone. I have learnt this from Hindu dharma. It has also taught me that “there is no religion greater than Truth”libtech_505_footnoteand that “ahimsa is the greatest religion”libtech_506_footnote. Patanjalilibtech_507_footnoteput the five vows of non-violence, truth, non-possession, non-stealing and brahmacharya on a scientific plane. These are to be found in the other religions too. But Hinduism alone has provided a scientific basis for them.
 After this Gandhiji while narrating the story of the South Indian Harijan saints Nandanar and Avvaiamma, said that Avvaiamma’s feet were stretched towards the temple’s deity. When some Hindus found fault with her, she asked them to place her feet where God was not present. But whichever side they turned her feet God was surely there.
 Idol worship is only one form of worshipping. But if  God resides in one’s heart, it hardly matters where one’s feet may be. Man can worship with his feet, and he can also kick with them. If there is a fire raging like a volcano it cannot be extinguished with water. If I
 control it with stones and standing on it save the lives of millions of people I will certainly have worshipped God with the stones and my feet. One can worship with one’s feet and hands and also with one’s tongue. Worship should be sincere, no matter what method one  adopts.
 That is why, if that gentleman is present here, I would like to request him to allow us to carry on the prayer in peace.
 I would like to emphasize that I am not at all angry with those young men. How could I be angry with them? The Gita does not preach anger. And right from my South Africa days I have been reciting the Gita verses in the course of my prayers. I have learnt this teaching of the Gita right from there and have carried it here with me. Those who oppose it do not know what Hinduism is. Not realizing it they indulge in devilish acts and forget God.
 After this the people were quiet and the prayer was held in peace. Gandhiji said:
 I am extremely grateful to God that today on the fourth day He allowed us to have our prayer in peace. Let me also tell you that nobody should think that no prayers were held during these days. When you came here, I came here and we all sat in silence, it was as good as praying, because there was prayer in our hearts.
 Then, I am also indebted to those who tried to disturb our prayers. I am grateful to them because I had an opportunity to look into my heart. I had no opportunity before to examine my heart  about the question of prayer. I had to search within to find out where I stood. Was there anger in my heart against them? Did my prayer mean something different? God wants to test His devotees in ever so many ways, and ultimately, He frees His devotee from his trouble as you have just heard in the  bhajanlibtech_508_footnotelibtech_509_footnote.  From  this  we  must  learn  that whatever we suffer is ordained by God. It is God’s grace that I have passed this test today.
 I am also grateful to the gentleman who was persuaded by the pundit’s appeal.
 God has saved me from a more difficult test. Once the prayer was started, even if as few as four persons had asked me to stop, I would have said: ‘You may cut my throat if you want, but I shall keep on repeating Rama Rahim, Rama Rahim,’ and even at that moment, instead of allowing myself to be overpowered by anger, I would have
 
 prayed to God to grant them good sense as was said in the Ramdhun.
 Let me narrate to you one thing that happened at Noakhali. It was with great difficulty that Ramdhun could be started there. Every time I started my journey we used to sing Ramdhun and as we approached some village we entered it with Ramdhun. We used to explain to the people that Rama, Rahim, Khuda, Ishwar were all names of God. In fact, God is known by millions of names.
 If I explain to you the meaning of Auz-o-Billahi you would not even know that it has been taken from Arabic. Would it then be a crime if I pray in Arabic? Please do not reduce Hinduism to a worthless faith by such acts. Hinduism is a great religions. It is an ancient religion. Lokamanya Tilaklibtech_510_footnotelibtech_511_footnotehas proved it to be ten thousand years old. But in my view it is older than a hundred thousand years. It is eternal. What is contained in the Vedas is the essence of dharma and dharma has come into being with the functioning of human beings. That is why the Vedas are said to be without a beginning. When men realized those things they inscribed them in their hearts. They were reduced to writing much later, because man learnt the art of writing afterwards. Many of the writings too are lost. Thus a large part of the Bible too is lost from memory. The same is the case with the Koran. Many scholars of the Bible are of the opinion that it has a number of interpolations. Thus, the Shastras are endless. The essence of the Shastras, i. e., the Vedas, is that God is, and He is One. The essence of the Koran and the Bible is the same. No one may say that the Bible mentions three Gods. It mentions only one God.
 I frequently visit the Viceroy. I am spending quite some time there. But that time is not wasted. I do there what I would do in Bihar, the Punjab, Noakhali and all the other places. For me the smallest work is as important as the biggest. For me whatever is in the atoms and molecules is in the universe. I believe in the saying that what is in the microcosm of one’s self is reflected in the macrocosmlibtech_512_footnote. If I leave out the Punjab, Bihar or Noakhali, I can do no work for India. For me India lives only in such places.
Today I have explained so many things to you. I feel happy

           world?    TALK WITH EUROPEAN VISITORS libtech_513_footnote    April 	5, 1947  Q. What can be India’s contribution to the elimination of violence in the   GANDHIJI: If the Congress succeeds in its non-violent effort the 
  	rest will settle down automatically. There are reports of quite a 	few Congressmen being involved in the Bihar riots. At this stage I 	cannot sift the truth in these reports. But how could such a rumour, 	even if false, spread?  One 	of them asked Gandhiji a question about his conception of free 	India’s economic policy. Gandhiji replied: I 	hope we shall never want to get rich by exploitation of others,  	having passed through that experience ourselves. For instance, we 	might export our textile manufactures to help a neighbouring country 	that was suffering from a cloth shortage, as a friendly act, but not 	to exploit indus-trially backward people. At present India exports 	raw materials to the U. S. A. How much do we have to suffer on that 	account? All our indus-tries have been ruined. How I wish Western 	powers learnt to look upon India not as a country to be exploited 	but as a country whose independence they should respect because it 	has been won without the power of armaments. Good relations should 	be maintained by both the parties. If you expect courtesy from me. I 	ought to treat you accordingly. If we lacked the technical know-how, 	they could provide it to us in a spirit of mutual help, not at a 	fabulous price. At present you have brought us to such a pass that 	we cannot do without your motor-cars and other luxury goods. You 	have crippled us. Christianity that came to India from the West was 	a mixed affair. If only Christian missions had come to render 	humanitarian service to the poor village folk, without the 	proselytizing motive, they would have earned their undying gratitude 	and proved themselves true heirs and representatives of Jesus 	Christ. But I regret to say that this does   The 	visitors were accompanied by Dr. Sjahrir of Indonesia and Jawaharlal  Nehru. 
 not benefit you. As for us we never stood to gain by it.
 I would say to whoever assaults me that he may destroy my home and hearth, why, even my person, but he would not be able to destroy my soul. I would not defend my country with foreign arms. If I could have my say I would place in the hands of the police hoe and spade instead of bayonets so that they could take to farming. Besides, a country wedded to non-violence is not bothered about foreign aggression because every citizen will be prepared to lay down his life. It is my belief that non-violence is not an entirely personal quality. It is an easy way of spiritual as well as political action for all—individual, society and country.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,     NEW DELHI,  April 	5, 1947 
  	It is a painful thing but for the remaining few days I shall have to 	ask you if there would be any protest from any quarter against the 	recitation from the Koran. If there are it will benefit neither you 	nor your religion. Just as God, in spite of the many names that 	describe Him, is but one, dharma although known by several names is 	but one; because all religions have come from God. They would be 	worthless if they had not come from God. Any religion which is not 	the religion of God is the religion of the Devil, and cannot but be 	worthless. You must, therefore, realize that if what has been 	happening for the last three days continues, it would mean the end 	of Hindu dharma.  	If I am a Hindu, why can I not recite from the Koran, or from the 	Zend-Avesta? Besides, the Hindu mode of worship also is no less 	diverse. Some would have recitations from the upanishads and not 	from the Vedas; some would want the Gita and not the 	upanishads, a third one would demand the Atharvaveda in 	preference to the Yajurveda. In other words, each one is 	entitled to pray in his own way. If you want to stop me, even today 	I am willing to accept defeat and let you win. If anyone from among 	you so desires, he can give me this cup of poison. If somebody does 	give it to me I would be glad to drink it and you too should bear 	with it. You do not have to drink the 
 poison but you will please witness it. Do not be angry but please understand that if this old man is forbearing he is doing the right thing.
 It is a good thing that you have come here in such large numbers. But if even one of you is opposed to the recitation of Auz-o- Billahi, I will abandon the prayer and you will have to go back peacefully.libtech_514_footnote
 I must thank you for maintaining the peace. Such peace was not usual before. If indicates that we have not lost our dharma by what happened during the past three days. If man does not live in peace, if he never inwardly examines his thoughts, is caught in the mad rush of life and remains excited all the time, he cannot produce what Shaukat Ali Saheb used to call “cold strength”. Mohammed Ali Saheb also used to say that we had to achieve independence by fighting the British and the taklis would be our cannon and the cones our cannon- balls. He had as much poetic imagination as erudition.
 And all this happened in your Delhi. In those days I had been staying with Rudra Saheblibtech_515_footnoteat his St. Stephen’s College residence. The College has now been shifted to some vast premises, but I first met Maulana Abul Kalam Azad in the same old building. There I met Prof. Abdul Bari as also many other great Maulanas. After long discussions it was decided that the Congress could join the Khilafat movementlibtech_516_footnoteonly if the whole movement was conducted peacefully. If was decided with God as witness that every activity of the Khilafat movement would be peaceful. It was a matter of swearing by Ishwar or Khuda. There was no distinction between Ishwar and Khuda. We are going to be rewarded with the fruit of what we did then.
 I mention this incident because tomorrow the National Week begins. It  was  on  this  daylibtech_517_footnotethat  India  realized  herself.  India  then realized that she lived not in Delhi or Bombay or Lahore but in her seven lakh villages. If there were a terrible earthquake destroying the entire urban population, even then India would not die. Even if the entire population of two crores in the cities perished, the 38 crores in the seven lakh villages would continue to live. The terrible earthquake that had rocked  Patnalibtech_518_footnotetoo  caused  damage  only  to  the  big  cities,
 leaving the tiny villages untouched. Of course, if the Cosmic Being described in the eleventh chapter of the Gita decides to swallow all, none would escape. It is however clear that India is alive because of her villages.
 These seven lakh villages were suddenly aroused on the 6th April, 1919. When I had issued an appeal on the 5th Aprillibtech_519_footnoteI had not imagined even in my dreams that India would be aroused to that extent. On that day I was at Salem in the house of Rajagopalachari who is your Minister now. I was thinking the whole day how to start the satyagraha. Shri Vijayaraghavachari—who is no more—and others too met me there. When the thought occurred to me I asked Mahadev—alas, he too is no more—to send for Rajaji. Rajaji agreed with me and we issued the appeal. Just by the appeal India was so aroused that I was wonder-struck. In those days the Congress had neither volunteers nor any means to carry messages, still it was like the passing of an electric current.
 We had appealed to the people to observe a fast and pray on the 6th of April. The Hindus observe fast for 36 hours where- as the Muslims may observe a  rozalibtech_520_footnotelibtech_521_footnotefor  only  24  hours.  The  Hin-  dus  too observe pradoshalibtech_522_footnotefor 24 hours. We also decided upon a fast for 24 hours so that both Hindus and Muslims could observe it. During this fast no food, milk, vegetables, etc., could be taken. One could take any amount of water. I had instructed that the aged and the weak like me could take fruit. But when you undertake the fast tomorrow you should not take fruits like bananas which satisfy hunger. This would be something like what my mother did, she used to put me on a fast- diet and feed me with purislibtech_523_footnotelibtech_524_footnoteof  kutulibtech_525_footnotelibtech_526_footnoteand  gulabjamunlibtech_527_footnotelibtech_528_footnotethe whole day long. I do not intend to pamper you as my mother pampered me. Those who cannot observe a complete fast may take fruit juice.
 The special message for the 6th April is Hindu-Muslim unity, khadi and village work; but who would do it today? Today if there is Hindu-Muslim unity anywhere, it is only in my heart. Even  the charkha is lying only by my side. You can also take up these things
 
 
 tomorrow if you wish. For doing this you must forget the past happenings. No matter what atrocities had been committed by the Muslims in the Punjab and by the Hindus in Bihar, both the communities should forget these things and think in terms of establishing brotherly relations. If you do not think along these lines, are you going to pray to God that He should make you as fanatical as the people in the Punjab and Bihar? Would you thus save yourselves and your religions? That is why you should undertake the fast only if your hearts are imbued with the spirit of 1919 and you would be able to imbibe that spirit only if you remain peaceful and calm.
 How would you attain peace? Spin for an hour daily and then tell me if you do not find peace. Pattani Saheblibtech_529_footnote,  Chairman  of  the Bhavnagar Council, member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India, could sleep after spinning for an hour at night when all other remedies failed.
 Hindu-Muslim unity can be established only through peace. I know it is a difficult task. Out non-violence is tested when we can remain calm even though a volcano may be raging in our hearts.
 And what is the harm if all of us die by remaining peaceful? Even if some Muslim kills me, he will be after all my brother. If we fail to preserve peace and forcibly retain the country’s unity our hearts will remain divided. And, if [the spirit of] Pakistan persists in our hearts and we are not willing on any account to live with our brothers peacefully, I warn you India will not be able to retain her freedom.
 Yes, in a way, Pakistan can be full of the nectar of nectar. But why do you need pistols, spears and swords for it? A Pakistan forced on others will be full of poison. Why should we force people to swallow this poison? If I do not poison others’ hearts, have no poison in mine and do not mind it if I have to die fighting all others, the Pakistan [thus achieved] would be a thing of love and so would be India. India will be full of the nectar of love when she belongs not only to the Hindus but also to the Muslims, Parsis, Christians and Sikhs in equal measure. And that Pakistan alone would be full of love where there would be place for all the communities and no malice against anyone. Because I am a believer in such an India and such a Pakistan, I would recite  Auz-o-Billahi even while I recite theGayatrilibtech_530_footnote

 and the Gita.
 Today is the seventh death anniversary of Andrews Saheblibtech_531_footnotelibtech_532_footnote. We should remember his qualities. He lived a very simple life. We were very close friends. He was a white man, but he was so simple and mixed so well with the villagers that it was difficult to believe that he was an Englishman. He did not even know how to dress properly. He used to wrap a dhoti loosely round his large body. He was not bothered about appearances. He had a heart of gold.libtech_533_footnote
 In conclusion, Gandhiji said that he had received a letter, which he would release to the Press, from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh that they had had nothing to do with the raising of objections to the prayer on the three previous days. He was glad to hear that and believed it. No organization could protect life or religion if it did not work absolutely in the open.

            DEAR 	LORD ISMAY,    LETTER TO LORD ISMAY    BHANGI 	COLONY, 	NEW DELHI,  April 	5, 1947 
  	Pandit Nehru gave me what you have described as an outline of a 	scheme. What I read is merely a copy of the points I hurriedly 	dictated,libtech_534_footnotelibtech_535_footnotewhereas, as I understood from H. E. the Viceroy, you 	were to prepare a draft agreement after the line of the points I had 	dictated. Of course you were at liberty to amend them, add to them 	and omit what you wished to omit.  	I had a chat with Pandit Nehru twice during the day, the second time 	when he handed a copy of the outline at 5 p.m.  	The seventh point should read thus: “Within the framework hereof 	Mr. Jinnah will be perfectly free to present for acceptance a scheme 	of Pakistan even before the transfer of power, provided, however, 	that he is successful in his appeal to reason and not to the force 	of arms which he abjures for all time for this purpose. Thus, there 	will be no compulsion in this matter over a province or a part    
 thereof.”
What I could not recall yesterday I now recall.
 The eighth will read as follows: “In the Assembly the Congress has a decisive majority. But the Congress shall never use that majority against the League policy simply because of its identification with the League but will give its hearty support to every measure brought forward by the League Government, provided that it is in the interest of the whole of India. Whether it is in such interest or not shall be decided by Lord Mountbatten as man and not in his representative capacity.”
 I have finished dictating this at 8·45 p.m. I am anxious that it reaches you tonight. Therefore, I have only made manifest correction and addition. The outline is by no means complete. When a draft agreement is prepared, many other points which should occur to any draftsman will have to be covered.
 I must add that Pandit Nehru has at least one vital objection to the outline. But I will not tax you with its mention here. If the outline appears workable to H. E. I would like to wait on him once more and discuss Pandit Nehru’s objections. Before putting it before Q. A. Jinnah I would like to show it to a few friends.
 Yours sincerely,

 Many 	thanks for your letter of even date.libtech_536_footnote  	The very thought that at the threshold of my friendship with Lord 	Mountbatten and you, there can be any misunder- standing at all 	fills me with grave doubts about my ability to shoulder the burden I 	have taken upon my weak self. It is impossible, at every stage, to 	reduce to writing conversations, and that would be, in my opinion, a 	bar to friendship. I can only say that there must be some defect in 	my understanding or my attentiveness if I misunderstand very simple 	things. I do not feel inclined to reproduce the talk about this 	topic    
 except to mention one thing, viz., that H. E. mentioned [V. P.] Menon to you and said you should prepare something in conjunction with him and I was to give you the points which were to become the basis of the draft you were to prepare.
 So far as you are concerned you correctly took down what you heard from me. But as it did not answer what I wanted to say I have given you my considered view about point 7.libtech_537_footnote
 Now that I have seen Nos. 3 and 4 I must differ from you in your view that with the new version of No. 7 and filling in of No. 8, Nos. 3 and 4 become redundant. But of this later, if we ever reach the consideration stage of the “outline”.
 Since writing this Badshah Khan came into my room and I find that he confirms the gist of the conversation with Lord Mountbatten as described by me and adds that when we went to your office I told you that I had only to give the points as I hastily thought of them in order to enable you and your draftsman to prepare a draft agreement.libtech_538_footnote

   A TALK  
 BHANGI  NIVAS, NEW DELHI,
 April 6, 1947
 Both of you should go to the Bhangi Colony and take up the task of teaching the children and of sanitation and so on. No one can afford to sit idle here. I would rather like Manu also to go there daily but she is not keeping well and as it is I am making her work beyond her capacity. Why worry about your husband’s loss of hearing? He can very well look after the sanitation work and you can teach the children. You will be learning something thereby. Then alone your and my stay here will serve any purpose. Along with this you should take interest in the prayer and study the opposition that is being voiced during the prayer meetings. There are women too in the opposition, and you should try to persuade them. I am surprised why none of these things occurred to you or [Anand]. If you work only
 when I point it out to you, it has no meaning. One has to look for work wherever one happens to be. There is no dearth of work here. If there is any dearth, it is that of workers, not of work.

You won’t let the Hindus murder me,” he added playfully. Gandhiji, overhearing the remark, interjected:

 misfortune is that I have not many like you who would die bravely and without anger.libtech_541_footnoteIf I had even half a dozen [men] like you, the flames that threaten to devour us would be put out and peace would reign in India in no time.

 BHANGI NIVAS, NEW DELHI,

 What a great misfortune it is for us that two brothers should talk to each other in English ! One of them claims that it is only in English that thoughts occur to him ! We have become such slaves to the English language. This slavery is of our own choice. I have openly told the British that it was wrong on their part to educate Indians through the English medium and in doing so they had caused immense harm to  our country. But I   cannot  blame  them  when  in
 
 normal course two Indians talk in English. For this we are ourselves to blame. We consider it to be our good fortune to be able to speak English. To fulfil that ambition we sacrifice endless time. If we speak faultless English and an Englishman happens to compliment us, we feel elated. If we were to count the hours we spend in learning English we would realize that we thereby deprive the country of the precious time that would have been otherwise devoted to its service, thus resulting in the wastage of countless hours. Still we cannot ever fully master English. I receive letters from persons holding high degrees, whose English is simply awful. One feels disgusted by them.  No  doubt, one should learn English as a hobby. It has a vast treasure of literature. But one should not make indiscriminate use of it. Quite a few dignitaries from among the delegates to the Asian Conference came to see me. But they conversed in their languages, viz., Japanese, Turkish, etc. There used to be an interpreter conversant with English and their languages. It occurred to me that that was the occasion when Hindustani could have become the language of the whole of Asia. Under such circumstances the interpreter would have learnt the language of the particular country as well as our national language. If it happens, Asia, which at present is divided into different parts, will witness one country developing cordial relations with the other as members of one family. It would indeed be a magnificent achievement. But to whom can I address my advice? You two brothers, fully conversant with Hindi and Punjabi, continue to talk in English !

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 NEW DELHI,
 April 6, 1947
 While I was listening to this bhajanlibtech_543_footnote, as also to the Ramdhun, the scene of my Noakhali days came vividly before my eyes. The partylibtech_544_footnotecomprising these very men and women used to accompany me for about half a mile while I proceeded on my tour in the morning.
 I only wish to tell you that you should not give up your goodness. If all the Muslims say that they wish to sever all connection with the Hindus and wish to live separately, should we out of anger start killing them? If we do that we shall be engulfed in such a holocaust that we shall all be reduced to ashes and none will survive Indiscriminate looting and arson will only spell disaster for the whole country. Regular warfare also, I must say, causes only destruction and nothing is gained thereby.
 What has been said in the Mahabharata is of universal application. It does not apply to Hindus alone. It depicts the story of the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Though they were blood-brothers the Pandavas worshipped Rama, that is, goodness, and the Kauravas followed Ravana, that is, evil. Renouncing ahimsa they took to violence and fought among themselves with the result that not only were the Kauravas killed, but the Pandavas also were losers in spite of their victory. Very few among them survived to see the end of the war and those who did found their lives so unbearable that they had to retire to the Himalayas. This is exactly what is happening in our country today.
 Today is the first day of the National Week. I trust you are observing it as a day of fasting and prayer. There was mass spinning also from 3 to 4 p.m. in which the Congress President, his wife, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Acharya Jugal Kishore and many others took part. The spinning yajna having been completed so beautifully and enthusiastically you will soon be breaking the fast but how good it
 
 would be if as a result of today’s rededication the names of Rama and Rahim and the message of the bhajan are permanently engraved in our hearts. But today all this remains but a dream in India.
 I am being inundated with abusive letters and telegrams. This shows how grossly some people misunderstand my ideas. Some think I consider myself too big even to reply to their letters while others think I am enjoying myself in Delhi while the Punjab is in flames. How can they understand that I am working day and night for them wherever I am? True, I cannot wipe their tears. God alone can do that.
 Khwaja Abdul Majid, who is a trustee of the Aligarh University, came to see me today.libtech_545_footnoteHe has a lot of landed property but at heart he is a fakir. He used to be my host whenever I went to Aligarh. Swami Satyadev Parivrajak, who had been on a pilgrimage to the Himalayas, used to accompany me. He was a very active worker but now God has taken him away. He told me he would accompany me but he would not join me if I dined with a Muslim. On hearing this Khwaja Saheb said, “If that is what his religion enjoins, I shall make separate arrangements for him.” Though the Swami was accompanying me Khwaja Saheb did not mind when the Swami did not dine with him. Would that those good old days were here again when there used to be heart-unity among Hindus and Muslims. Khwaja Saheb continues to be the president of the nationalist Muslims. Other nationalist Muslims who had graduated from the Aligarh University in those days are today ideal students of the Jamia Millia and are excellent workers. They are like on oasis in the Sahara. Even if somebody killed Khwaja Saheb he would not wish him ill. Such people may be few but we must retain our innate qualities. When faced with bad characters we should not stoop to their level. But we committed this mistake in Bihar. Nationalist Muslims had been killed by Hindus there and Hindus friends of Islam had been done to death by Muslims.
 We should dispassionately think where we are drifting. Hindus should not harbour anger in their hearts against Muslims even if the latter wanted to destroy them. Even if the Muslims want to kill us all we should face death bravely. If they established  their  rule  after killing Hindus we would be ushering in a new world by sacrificing our lives. None should fear death. Birth and death are inevitable for every
 human being. Why should we then rejoice or grieve? If we die with a smile we shall enter into a new life, we shall be ushering in a new India.  The  Concluding  verseslibtech_546_footnotelibtech_547_footnoteof  the  second  chapter  of  the   Gita describe how a godfearing man should live. I would exhort you to read and understand those verses and ponder over their meaning. You will then realize what our ideal is and how far short of it we are today. Our independence is at our threshold and it is our duty  to  ask ourselves whether we are fit to have it and sustain it. This week, while I am here, I propose to administer you the dose which would make you worthy of freedom. If we keep on quarrelling amongst ourselves we shall lose our freedom even after attaining it.

   TALK WITH DELEGATES FROM VIET NAM  
 April 6, 1947
 If the Congress firmly implements the constructive programme given by me, including khadi, village industries, prohibition, removal of untouchability, communal harmony, uplift of women, adult education, etc., it would become a truly non-violent body  and freedom would automatically come.
 India’s contribution to the welfare of the allied nations and world peace would be without compromising her adherence to non- violence and truth and her goal of complete independence.
 I believe that there is unnecessary delay in granting us independence and irrelevant issues are being raised. The presentday communal riots are also an unfortunate outcome of that policy. I, therefore, say with certainty that thereby the British are harming themselves. This is the moment of my greatest trial. The moment has now arrived to demonstrate successfully my weapon of nonviolence. And, in this quest I am not taking a moment’s rest. Day and night I pray to God that He may give me light. There is considerable violence in the hearts of Congressmen and they are no less selfish. I have sufficient evidence of this. Even if Congressmen alone had imbibed
 nonviolence and truth, freedom would have come sixteen years ago, that is, in 1931, and our history would have been different. But I do not wish to complain about that. I must manage with whatever knife I may be having to cut this mosambi. If I do not have a knife I should learn to cut it even with the blunt edge of a dish. How long can one carry on with a borrowed knife? And, if I borrow a knife from someone, I cannot refuse if in turn he asks for a precious thing from me. That is why I flatly decline to seek help from any other country to attain the independence of my own country.

 April 7, 1947
 
 
 
 
 
NEW DELHI,
  Monday, 	April 7, 1947   BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	I am constantly receiving letters accusing me of being subservient   	to   M.   A.   Jinnahlibtech_561_footnotelibtech_562_footnoteand 	  being   a   fifth-columnist.   One correspondent has accused me of 	becoming a communist. But I an unaffected by such attacks. The 	verses of the Gita to which you listen every day are always 	in my mind and give me the strength to put up with such things. If 	my critics understood the meaning of these verses they would not say 	such things. I am a sanatani Hindu and therefore claim to be a 	Christian, a Buddhist and a Muslim. Even some Muslims feel I have no 	right to recite from the Koran. They think by doing so  I am trying 	to beguile the muslims. They do not realize that religion cannot be 	confined within the boundaries of language or script. I do not see 	why I can’t read from the Koran or consider Mohamad as my prophet. 	I have faith in the saints and prophets of every religion. I pray to 	God that I may not lose my head over those who accuse me; in fact I 	am ready to die at their hands. I firmly believe that if I am 	steadfast in my faith I shall be serving not only Hinduism but also 	Islam.  	Today a Hindu from Rawalpindi narrated the tragic events that had 	taken place there. Fiftyeight of his companions were killed just      
 because they were Hindus. He and his son alone could survive. The villages around Rawalpindi have been reduced to ashes. What a pity that Rawalpindi where Sikhs and Muslims once vied with one another in welcoming me and the Ali Brothers has become a danger spot for non-Muslims. The Hindus of the Punjab are seething with anger. The Sikhs say that they are the followers of Guru Govind Singh who has taught them how to wield the sword. But I would exhort the Hindus and Sikhs again and again not to retaliate. I make bold to say that if Hindus and Sikhs sacrifice their lives at the hands of Muslims without rancour or retaliation they will become the saviours not only of their own religions but also of Islam and the whole world.
 I have been preaching truth and non-violence for the last thirty years I had done the same thing in South Africa for twenty years and I believe that the Indians there have been the gainers for following my advice. Even here those who have trodden the path of truth and non- violence have not been losers at all. True, the satyagrahis have sacrificed their all. But what does it matter? They have gained a gem and thrown away what was worthless. I am hesitating to go to the Punjab as I am not sure what I would do there. Should I go there to take revenge? The thought of taking revenge appears quite pleasing but God tells me that it is not for me to take revenge. A number of persons have advised me that I must go to the Punjab. But I have told them that I am not going to speak in favour or retaliation because that would be doing a disservice to Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims.
 Let me tell the Muslims also that it is sheer madness to talk of wresting Pakistan by fighting with the Hindus and Sikhs. Pakistan is supposed to be the land of peace. M. A. Jinnah asserts that justice will prevail there. Today why don’t we find justice there? What happened in Bihar, he may ask. But the Bihar Chief Minister is miserable today. ‘Where had the Congress gone? What has it done?”, one may ask. It is a big question. The Congress should exercise equal authority over both Hindus and Muslims. But this is not the case today. I cannot even think of Pakistan where there would be no peace and security for a non-Muslim nor can I think of an India where Muslims may be in danger. I went to Bihar and tried to pacify angry Hindus and to create a sense of confidence among the Muslims in respect of the Hindus. Happily a large number of Hindus expressed regret and promised that such a thing would not be allowed to be repeated in future. Similarly,  I would appeal to Muslim leaders to ask their fellow-Muslims in
 Muslim majority provinces to refrain from trying to wipe out non- Muslims in those areas. No matter how provocative had been the language of Hindus and Sikhs in the Punjab, that was no excuse for the barbarity and cruelty perpetrated on non-Muslims by Muslims in the areas where they were in a majority.
 During the last two days distressing news has again been received from Noakhali. But in spite of everything it is wrong and cowardly to seek police or military protection. Those who cry when the disturbances break out are slaves and those who seek military protection will remain slaves for ever. People do not like civil war nor do they like to remain in slavery. In their letters Satis Babu and Pyarelal have inquired what is to be done when thatched huts with scores of people locked inside are set ablaze.
 Haran Babu has also written in the same strain from Chaumuhani and sent the information that some people  in  their  charge who were intending to leave have been persuaded to stay on. I have telegraphed to the Chief Minister of Bengal that this is a dangerous development.libtech_563_footnotelibtech_564_footnoteI have sent a message   to  the  people  that those who have the fortitude and courage should sacrifice their lives and let themselves be burnt. If they don’t find in themselves the strength to do so they may migrate to other places.libtech_565_footnotelibtech_566_footnoteMany a great men has resorted in the past to migration. Mohamed did it once. Whatever people do, they should in no case call the army belonging to the British, whom we wish to drive away. So many sons of England and Japan died in the last War but their people didn’t grieve for them. Theirs are brave races. To have a preference for British rule would be a shame for us.
 Will the land protected by the immortal Himalayas and irrigated by the waters of the healthgiving Ganga ruin itself through violence? I hope in my heart of hearts that we shall give up the very thought of maintaining large armies. The armies are not going to do us any good and so long as they remain our independence will be meaningless.

   A TALK libtech_567_footnote  
 BHANGI NIVAS, NEW DELHI,
 April 7, 1947
 First of all, let us take up communal unity because that is the crying need of the day. Had the 18-point constructive programmelibtech_568_footnotebeen acted upon earnestly since the time I had put it forward, the tragic events all over the country would not have overtaken us. I hold that without communal unity we are simply crippled. If any one of the functions in our body stops we are considered ill. The same thing applies to our country. How can such a country  achieve independence? And even if it is achieved, how can it be preserved? There are innumerable communities like Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Sikhs, and others in India and unless all the communities are united we shall continue to be weak and sickly. That is to say we shall remain slaves and even if we achieve independence there will be no happiness in it. In fact that freedom will be worse than slavery. This is my reading of the present situation.
 My faith is being strengthened every day that no one need buy an inch of cloth if everyone plies the charkha daily—just for half an hour. Not only that, this is the key to the preservation of swaraj. If crores of people devoted half an hour to spinning, its result would amaze the whole world. There is no alternative to khadi for bettering the lot of the famishing millions. A number of industries have developed in the wake of khadi which provide livelihood to artisans like carpenters, blacksmiths, peasants, weavers and so on. I compare
 the charkha to the sun and say that so long as its wheel goes on rotating, it spreads light throughout the whole country. The uplift of India depends solely on the uplift of the villages. India lies in its seven lakh villages, not in Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Lahore or Karachi.
 Third on the list is removal of untouchability. So long as untou- chability remains we shall not be able to touch one another’s hearts. How can people so estranged gain swaraj through non-violent means? The gross indifference with which we treat our brethren who carry night-soil is a blot on our country. If we believe in non-violence and truth we should make no discrimination between high and low and should have no false sense of superiority. We should regard the whole world as a family and live like members of one family.
 Intoxicants have impoverished us physically as well as economically. Ours is not a cold climate where drinking of alcohol may be necessary. Moreover an addict to intoxicants has no moral sense and therefore the habit would put an end to spirituality in our land. Then as the Gita says, “loss of memory ruins the reason”libtech_569_footnote. And those who have lost their reason are as good as dead.
 Woman in our scriptures is called ardhangini libtech_570_footnote. But instead of treating her as an ardhangini we treat her as a plaything. Or in our country she is still being treated like a slave. The birth of a girl  spreads gloom, whereas the birth of a boy is considered to be a festive occasion. So long as this evil custom is not done away with root and branch, women can make no progress whatsoever. Man and woman will attain equality only when the birth of a girl is celebrated with as much joy as in the case of a boy. Every worker, therefore, should respect woman as his mother sister or daughter. The way we are misbehaving with women and dishonouring them, about which one hears daily, shows the extent of our shamelessness, meanness and bestiality. I think there is no redemption from this sin.
 So long as enough attention is not paid towards sanitation of villages, the inhabitants will never have purity of heart and their condition will be symbolized by the garbage dumps one finds in the villages. Therefore, sanitation in villages is an equally important item in village reconstruction.
 I have seen that if we want to impart education with good foundation, basic education is necessary. And it can only be given through Nayee Talim. Unless we adopt Nayee Talim crores of India’s children cannot be educated. Adult education will also come within its scope automatically. Similarly we will have to adopt the national
 
 language. We are too much enamoured of English. Only yesterday I have vent to my thoughts regarding English.libtech_571_footnotelibtech_572_footnotelibtech_573_footnoteIt   is  because  of  out infatuation with English that we have neglected our national language, which is inexcusable. A worker, who knows the national language, will not bother himself about the controversy of Persianized Urdu or Sanskritized Hindi but will speak a language which is easily  understood by local people. He will learn the local language of the village selected by him and try to inculcate respect for the national language among the people there. Thus one who learns a new  language loses nothing, on the contrary his knowledge increases thereby.
 In the end I would only say that under swarajya efforts should be made for providing everyone at least with a square meal, enough clothing to cover himself and a house to live in. At present while some have utensils of gold and silver, others have not even post of clay— some have garments of silk and brocade whereas others have not even enough clothing to cover their nakedness. The constructive programme, as presented by me, is the only solution for the removal of such gross inequalities. Instead we are showing a leaning towards Russian communism which draws its strength from the pistol. That is the way of violence. Even there it has not proved successful as yet. If we adopt that method here the handful of capitalists that we have will become paupers, while a vast majority is already living in a state of poverty. Instead, if we propagate economic equality through non- violent means as suggested by me, these capitalists will out of shame realize that they ought not to eat sweets and don brocades while their brethren were without food and clothing. This will naturally foster a feeling of fraternity and serve the larger interests of the nation.

   INTERVIEW WITH SIR M. DERLING libtech_577_footnote  
 BHANGI COLONY, NEW DELHI,
 April 8, 1947
 Q. It appears now the British are preparing to quit. Will they partition the country? What type of government will be formed and which parties will be invited to participate in it?
 BAPU: My objective opinion is that the British should leave without worrying about us. And this is in their interest as  well.  America and England are, no doubt, big nations—advanced and ambitious, but in comparison with the mute millions of Asia and Africa, their eminence is just like dust. Until they wash clean the blot on their faces they have no right to talk big. And equally true is the fact that people are no longer going to be fooled by their tall talk. It will be in their interest to earn the blessings of the millions of Africa and Asia by giving them the human right of freedom.
 I admit there will be chaos once the British leave India. Even at present, strife is very much in evidence everywhere. But I believe if they grant the country its independence in all sincerity and in an orderly manner, all the quarrels will come to an end and the leaders of all the parties will be able to come together and form a stable government. But I do not know whether it is going to happen or not, because I am aware of the fact that there is a large section in favour of the vivisection of India. Who cares for the nation today? Everyone wants to realize his ambition and grab power by creating dissensions. This is the situation obtaining today.
 However, I am an optimist. I therefore think that the sincerity with which the British relinquish power will determine how well organized the new Government will be. And the Congress, the Muslim League and the States will be well represented in it.
 It hurts me to talk about the partition of the country. What will be the plight of a body if it is dismembered? Similarly, dismemberment of a prosperous country like India will utterly ruin the people. Today it is the country which is being divided, tomorrow it may be Kashmir and the day after it may be the State of Junagadh in the remote corner of Kathiawar. How is it all possible? Let the whole of India be handed over to the League. I would not mind it. That is why I believe that if, after the exit of the British power, the people of
 
 India are not awakened, India will become the battle-ground for the Princes to fight among themselves and the big ones among them will try to gain sovereignty by swallowing up the smaller ones.
 My non-violence will not destroy anyone, it will only purify. I therefore tell the Princes that they need not have any fears because the Congress has always been in favour of coming to terms with them. The Congress has adopted the policy of non-violence. The Princes have to delegate power to the people’s representatives of their own accord. Then the Congress will treat them with respect. We do not want to do away with the Princes After all, they are also citizens of India, aren’t they? The Princes have only to reform themselves and become servants of their subjects. The Congress will be on their side to help them. Unless they mend their ways they will be inviting their own doom.

   TALK WITH AMERICAN JOURNALISTSlibtech_578_footnote  
 BHANGI   COLONY, NEW DELHI,
 April 8, 1947
 If you are proud of your country and wish to convey that impression during your  visit to another country, you  should exemplify in your conduct, the innate good qualities and special features of your nation. If, therefore, you, who have come here to make a study, want to leave a good impression about your country, you will have to bear yourself accordingly. Otherwise you are liable to be misunderstood and might unknowingly be done injustice. I give the same advice to Indians living abroad. There are many good features in our country. Take for example non-violence and khadi among industries. Therefore I cry myself hoarse telling the Indians settled abroad that even if they did not ply the charkha here, it is their duty to ply it regularly there. Even if they did not wear khadi here, there they should wear it habitually. Instead, innumerable  Indians have become enamoured of silks and other things available in foreign countries. The result is that the country does not gain in moral strength. They should demonstrate to the women there that we can do
 
 
 without brandy or cigarettes; they should tell them what an Aryan woman stands for.
 Addressing the woman journalist Gandhiji said:
 Similarly you should show here that woman occupies an important place in the world and she is not merely a plaything for men, that she is courageous too. Try to leave upon the women here an impress of your culture.
 I would like to make a suggestion to you which I feel would appeal to you. If you like it, you may keep it in mind and try to act accordingly, otherwise forget it. I am obliged to you even for listening to me. My suggestion is that women can play a very important role in establishing peace. Instead of being carried away by science they should follow the path of non-violence because women by nature are endowed with the quality of forgiveness. Women will never succeed in aping men in everything, nor can they develop the gift nature has bestowed on them by doing so. They should neither allow their family members to have, nor should they themselves have any connection with anything relating to war. God has endowed women with hearts overflowing with love. They should utilize this gift properly. That power is all the more effective because it is mute. I hold that God has sent women as messengers of the gospel of non-violence.
 Gandhiji’s fair visitor was deeply moved: “If there is anyone in the world who can point the way of deliverance to womankind, it is you We realize that what
 you have told us today is also the answer to the challenge of the atom bomb.	Why
 do you not visit our country?”
 BAPU: Yes, I would indeed like very much to visit your country. But at present I see no such prospect. If you want me to go there I would request you to help me by devoting yourself to the service of my coutnry. Try to quell the riots that are raging amongst us and help in stopping the killing of women and children. I shall certainly be free to visit your country provided you are successful in your attempt, provided a democratic government is proclaimed here and the millions of people here are as happy as you are in your country. But this is like attempting to pluck a flower from the sky.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,     NEW DELHI,  April 	8, 1947 
  	I find that you are nowadays so quiet that there is no need to thank 	you every day. Today I wish to speak about my own sad plight and I 	hope every word of mine will enter your ears and my message will 	touch your hearts, that is, it will move you to the depths of your 	hearts.  	You must have seen the telegrams from Satis Babu and Haran Babu in 	the newspapers yesterday. Today Satis Babu has sent a telegram in 	reply in which he states that Jiwansingh, Pyarelal and other 	co-workers of mine who have been working there have decided to stick 	on till the last moment and everybody agrees that what I say is 	right. Hindus will abide by my advice. The danger is very grave and 	the risk to one’s life is constantly increasing. They are 	miserable but are still preparing  	themselves in a determined and peaceful manner. Now they do not like 	the idea of running away in fear. They think that if they have got 	to face death it is better to accept it as a gift from God. It means 	laying down one’s life cheerfully, not dying after killing. All 	this is the result of the work done so far.  	I had asked them whether they desired me to leave my work here and 	go to them. I have other important things to do. I have to go to 	Bihar. Then there is the Punjab, too. They have written to me that I 	should not think of going there at all.  	All these people are working in different places. Satis Babu is 	working in one place while Haran Babu is doing a difficult job at 	Chaumuhani. Amtussalaam, Pyarelal, Kanu and Abhalibtech_579_footnotehave selected a village each. I am confident that 	they will all conduct themselves in the manner I expect them to do. 	And, what is my expectation? I expect that, as this girl sings in 	the Ramdhun, “May God grant good sense 	to everyone”. I shall go on hoping that the people would realize 	that nothing is to be gained by force and violence. If anyone does 	gain something or gets something done by others through violence, 	his gain would not last long. This is the way of robbers and 	bandits. If  
 others resort to robbery, should we also do the same? No, we shall certainly not go their way. If they want to kill us, we shall willingly die.
 I am happy to see that we have in our midst brave people who are willing to meet death in this manner. Such people as well as the country will benefit from their bravery. Even while dying they will bear no ill will against those who kill them, nor will they wish to get them punished. Those who kill are not going to escape punishment. God will punich them. Who are we to mete out punishment? We would not appeal even to God to punish them, because God is all merciful. We would pray to Him for mercy for ourselves and also for our enemies, and would meet death trying to bear goodwill towards all, including those who might kill us. No matter what happens, in  whatever He does, God will only be merciful.
 But if anyone from among these people dies, do you think I would say: ‘Oh, what a tragedy !’ No I would not. I would rather say that he had done well to have rendered such a great service. I would say that he had served the Muslims too while carrying out God’s work.
 But death retreats from those who show courage and are ready to die. We should hope that they do not have to die. There is Suhrawardy Saheb and also other officer, big and small. God will grant good sense even to those who have taken to robbery and they will also take the warning and give up oppressing people. I even hope that all the Muslims there would come together and take upon themselves the responsibility of protecting their Hindu brethren and I would receive telegrams from the Muslims everywhere that I should have no worry and that there was nothing to fear from their side. When this happens, I would dance with joy.
 A friend asks why I, though a Hindu, say that I am a Muslim [also]. This is an obvious thing. I have learnt this from the Gita. The Gita says.
  1
 That is, “he who sees Me everywhere never vanishes from Me nor I from him.” For instance there is Rama in the Koran, the Zend Avesta and the Bible as well and god as worshipped by the Christains,
 
 
 Ormuzd as worshipped by the Parsis and Khuda as invoked by the Muslims are but different names of Ishwara. And, because I am a true Hindu, believing in Hindu dharma, I am also a Christian  and  a Muslim. This is no mere fancy or empty talk. This is the truth. The Ishopanishad also says: “I am in everything and everything is in me.”libtech_580_footnotelibtech_581_footnoteIt further says: “He moves and He moves not.”libtech_582_footnotelibtech_583_footnoteThus God has been described in various ways in the Gita and the upanishads.
 In another letter I have been asked to explain why I call myself a servant [of God] and if Rama and Rahim mean the same to me, why do I not choose either one of them. I give this explanation because I claim to be a servant of God. Lord Vishnu is known by a thousand names. But God is known not by just a thousand but a hundred thousand names. In fact I would say God has 400 million names. Hence, why must call Him just Rama or Rahim? And then someone asks whether I talk like this merely to appease the Muslims.
 My answer is No. I have not formulated this prayer after any deliberation. Abbas Tyabji’s daughter Raihana, who is a staunch Muslim and also a Hindu, had asked me if she could teach me Auz-o- Billahi. I consented and said she might as well convert me to Islam. She declined and said that I was as good as her father and she was my daughter. She called me a good Hindu and saw no need to convert me to Islam. But she taught me Auz-o-Billahi and since then it has formed a part of the prayer. In the same way, after [one of] my fasts Dr. Gilder taught me a Zoroastrian hymn which too has been a part of the prayer ever since. I always hunger for Ramanama. I will recite it in a thousand ways and if someone comes and forces me to recite or not to recite any particular name I will recite no names at all.libtech_584_footnote
 Q. You said that those who have neither the courage nor the wish to die should migrate. But where should they go?
A. These few men can be accommodated anywhere in this vast
 country. In the first place they can create a settlement for themselves in the Punjab itself, but if that is not possible this country is big enough for them to find some place in it. I need not tell them where they should go. Let it be remembered, however, that they should not go about begging, stretching out their hands before others but should rely on their own strength.
 
 Holding up to ridicule some letters in English, Gandhiji said that he himself did not know English well and he was like the castor-oil plant being treated as a tree  in a desert. But if even he could find so many mistakes in their English how many more mistakes would be found by an English expert? In any case, what was the need of writing in English and typing the letters?
 Q. Are you not ashamed of calling the police during your prayers?
 A. I am really very much ashamed and every time the police have attempted to restore peace during the prayer I have stopped the prayer. Moreover, I did not beg of Sardar Patel to send the police for my protection. But if the police do come in spite of this, they also might learn a few good things form the prayer and Ramanama. Why should we resent it?
 Q. From where did you bring non-violence into Hinduism? With non-violence you are turning the Hindus into cowards.
A. I cannot think even in my dream that anyone has become a
 coward because of me. Even the young girl Abha who used to be a little afraid before has become brave after staying with me. I told her that her husband would not be accompanying her. And now she visits the sensitive spots all by herself. Would you call her a coward? She goes there unarmed. She does not insist even on having a dagger before proceeding to such places. She hardly keeps even a kitchen knife. I have never said that the moment you hear a danger signal you should run for your lives. We have to die and die without killing others. Non-violence is the quintessence of Hinduism. Your Gita teaches non-violence. I say the essence of Islam too is non-violence and Christianity too teaches non-violence.

They should set up civil 	defence squads. They should realize how ill-informed we are with 	regard to shortages of food and clothing. They must find out how, if 	we so desire, we can get over these shortages and then convince 	others      
 about it. They should teach the villagers, as best as they can, all the processes of cloth-making starting with the sowing of cotton to the weaving of cloth. They should give particular attention to sanitation of the villages. They must get latrines put up at convenient places so that people do not ease themselves just anywhere. People should be instructed to cover night-soil properly with earth. The villagers should be taught how night-soil can be turned into good manure. They  should be persuaded to take to adult education and to give education to their children.
 It is my belief that communalism is one of the many evils of city-life. It is necessarily an outcome of urbanization. Such an atmosphere is not to be found in the villages. The villages cannot even afford to be communal. Our villagers are so poor that they constantly need one another. Their mutual relations are such that they live in a kind of family atmosphere. Hence the problem does not arise there.

  	Have you boycotted me? There is not a single letter from you. Think 	over what happened on the last day. Forget that I was angry; try to 	understand the reason behind it. Write to me about the conditions 	there. How is your health? 
      From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G. N. 581        A TALK         Gandhiji 	remarked to Manu:  Blessings 	from  BAPU          BHANGI 	COLONY, 	NEW DELHI  April 	9, 1947 
  	You should understand the whole episode as such incidents are quite 	common.  Addressing 	the womanlibtech_590_footnoteGandhiji 	said:  	Your husband has got the degrees of B. A. and LL. B. I would still 	call him ignorant. He has behaved in a manner that does not befit 	his education. The right course would have been to educate you and 	remove your ignorance. But your husband played a trick on you and 	you were gullible enough to believe him. I see nothing strange in 	it. Women in our society take pride in being led by the nose by 	their husbands. So long as people are not ashamed of resorting to 	such mean conduct we shall not reach our goal. This I have said in 	your defence. Now the main question is, what should you do in the 	present circumstances? You should devote yourself to any work of 	service. If you are not prepared for that you can go and join the 	classes that are run under the Kasturba Trust. You should therefore 	prepare yourself for service and forget that you were ever married.  	Another alternative is, if you are not able to restrain yourself, 	you should find an eligible partner and marry him. Such companions 	are not easily found. Therefore be content in making the effort and 	if   papers 
 your efforts are good they are bound to be crowned with success. [From Gujarati]

   TALK WITH FRIENDS libtech_591_footnote  
 BHANGI COLONY, NEW DELHI
 April 9, 1947
 The nearer we are approaching independence, the more dependent on others, I believe, we are becoming. According to me independence means that one should not seek anyone’s help for fulfilling one’s own needs. Independence does not mean mere physical indepen- dence.
 A businessman desires his customers’ needs to go on increasing. On the one hand our needs are on the increase and on the other there is a class clamouring for ending capitalism. I fail to understand this. For instance, you know that readymade food is available in England and America. The trend has come here also. When people invite someone for dinner they place an order with a hotel like Taj Mahal of Bombay. The result will be that the class of women that used to take up cooking as an art will gradually disappear. And I can even imagine a time when perhaps cooking will be a forgotten art for women. Let me give you a small example. If you ask my daughter her to make bajra chapatis she won’t be able to prepare them. If the girls of today are forgetting such small things, what would they not forget in future?
 All laughed looking at Manu.
 That is why I hold that if one wants to enjoy independence one should oneself learn to produce the things one needs daily.
 One should be able to do without the things one could not produce oneself. This increases self-reliance and one’s progress. If we are not able to make good use of political freedom, what purpose would it serve? Self-reliance is the foundation of independence and dependence on others is a sign of slavery. Such self-reliant persons need never go to court or have any disputes. They settle their disputes among themselves. They will impose a small tax upon themselves and with its revenue a number of schools will be opened for children,
 
 where teachers will earn their livelihood and also get the necessary training. Such education will not be a burden on anyone. Where is the need for army or police if we are able to protect ourselves? There are progressive and enthusiastic workers in Kathiawar. They have to be alert to shoulder heavy responsibilities in future. I have full faith that a small State like Kathiawar will set an ideal for the whole country. And the Kathiawaris have the capability to guide the whole nation. They are not very knowledgeable but are courageous and wise.
 At the same time Kathiawar has many defects. The Kathiawaris as you know wear pugrees. According to a saying they have as many twists in their hearts as they have in their pugrees. If that is so, that very Kathiawar can prove to be a blot on the country.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,     NEW DELHI  April 	9, 1947 
  	Last time when I was here you heard the same  bhajanlibtech_592_footnotelibtech_593_footnotewhich 	Sucheta Devi sang just now. Its beautiful words were sung in a voice 	as sweet as the words. Even today while listening to it I felt as 	though it were new and I had not heard it before. How wonderful if 	our country were as described in the bhajan and we could say 	that there was no sorrow or suffering. But we know the country is in 	no such condition. If one after another everyone becomes good as 	suggested in the bhajan, the country would also become good. 	What is the strength of an ocean? After all, it is made up of 	individual drops. Similarly, a country too is constituted of its 	citizens. Today we are not in a position to sing the bhajan with 	a clear conscience. Suppose we start looking for such a country, 	where would we find one? Our body is such a country and the atman 	residing within is the inhabitant of that country. They bhajan 	describes the qualities that should belong to the atman. We 	ought to imbibe these qualities in us. If we are able to do so our 	country would surely be beautiful—whether it is known by the name 	of Hindustan or Pakistan, whether it has 11 provinces or 21, or  
 any other number. We must all live in such a way that everyone lives in comfort, none remains poor and none oppresses his fellow-beings.
 To build such a country you have to live, all of us have to live, in-cluding myself. But what is happening now is just the opposite. The piles of letters I receive contain abuse as well all praise. We should surrender all abuse as well as praise to God and have nothing to do with either.
 I think some of those who write these letters must be present in this meeting. I am glad that they are hearing my words, because listening to me they will understand me and work for the benefit of the country.
 We are going to attain independence. We have not yet attained it. If we work unitedly, the Viceroy would leave this very day, or he would entrust all responsibilities to us and silently watch us or would stay on to do what we might ask of him, for his own satisfaction. He is not the kind of man who would sit idle. He belongs to the royal family and is extremely intelligent. His wife also is a talented lady. We can utilize their talents to advantage. But this cannot be done under the prevailing circumstances. He would continue to be  here  for another fourteen months and testify whether India behaves well or otherwise. It was with a view to seeing India that the delegates from the Asian countries had come to attend the Inter-Asian Relations Conference. But they went back with the impression that the Hindus and Muslims were fighting with each other. Nobody knows why they are fighting. I at any rate do not know what they are quarrelling about.
 Are the Muslims fighting for Pakistan? They  say  that  they would have Pakistan at any cost. Would they have it by compelling us to give it? Would they take it by force? By force they cannot have even an inch of land. By persuasion they may have the whole of India. I would welcome it if Jinnah Saheb became the first President of free India and formed his own Cabinet. But there would be one condition, namely, that with God as witness, he should regard Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and all others as equals.
 One of the correspondents asks why I should not be called “Muhammed Gandhi”? And then he hurls the choicest abuses, which need not be repeated here. If we ignore the person who abuses us, he will repeat his performance once, twice, thrice, several times—only to tire of it. Being tired he would either keep quiet or, driven by anger,
 kill us. But what would happen after he kills us? We would lose nothing. One might ask: ‘Who would protect our wives and children?’ But he should realize that there is God to protect them. Why, then, should we worry?
 The best way to stop the agitation for the partition of Bengallibtech_594_footnotelibtech_595_footnoteis to persuade the Hindus through reasoning and assure them right now that they would not be forced to act one way or the other. By their wholly impartial conduct the Muslims must prove that the Hindus need have no misgivings about justice and fairplay in Pakistan, that no favours would be shown to the Muslims just because they are Muslims, and while selecting men for Government jobs merit alone would be the consideration. If Suhrawardy Saheb acts in this manner, the whole of Bengal would become an independent province. Then there would be no question of dividing the province into three or four.  By placating the minorities he should thus win them over. He should treat the Hindus in such a way that they insist on having Suhrawardy as their Chief Minister. He should enjoy theirfull confidence.
 But that is not the position now. Today I have received a letter from   Sushilalibtech_596_footnotewho   was   formerly   running   a   school   at   Rajkot. Describing the situation where she is now working, she says that there was so much terror in the air that no Hindu woman ventured to go there even if escorted, not to speak of going alone. When she herself went there, the other women could go with her.
 I cannot help saying that if Indians evince true courage the coercive method now adopted to achieve Pakistan cannot but fail in its purpose. I dare say the talk of achieving Pakistan by force and threats is but an idle dream.

   DRAFT FORMULAlibtech_597_footnote  
 [April 10, 1947]libtech_598_footnote
  So 	far as 	pakistan is 	concerned and 	so far 	as the 	Congress is 	concerned nothing will 	be yielded 	to force. 	But everything 	just will be conceded 	readily if 	it appeals to 	reason. Since 	nothing is 	to  be  forcibly taken, 	it should 	be open 	to any 	province or 	part thereof 	to abstain 	from joining 	Pakistan and 	remain with 	the remaining provinces. 	Thus, so 	far as 	the Congress 	is aware 	today, the Frontier 	Province is 	with it 	(Congress) and 	the Eastern part of 	the Punjab where 	the Hindus 	and the 	Sikhs combined have 	a decisive majority will 	remain out 	of the pakistan zone. 	Similarly in the East, 	Assam is clearly 	outside the zone 	of Pakistan 	and the Western 	part of Bengal 	including Darjeeling, 	Dinajpur, Calcutta, Burdwan, Midnapore, 	Khulna, 24- 	Paraganas, etc., where 	the Hindus are in a decisive majority will remain 	outside the Pakistan 	zone. And since 	the Congress is  willing  to concede 	to reason 	every- thing just, it is 	open to 	the muslim 	League to appeal 	to the 	Hindus, by 	present just 	treatment, to 	reconsider their 	expressed view and to divide Bengal.  It 	is well to 	mention in 	this connection 	that if 	the suggested 	agreementlibtech_599_footnotelibtech_600_footnotegoes through, the Muslim League will participate fully in the 	Constituent Assembly in 	a spirit 	of co-operation. 	It might 	also be mentioned 	that it is the settled policy with the Congress that the system 	of separate 	electorates has done 	the greatest 	harm to the national 	cause and 	therefore the 	Congress will insist on 	joint electo- rates 	throughout with 	reservation of seats wherever it is considered necessary.  The present raid of Assamlibtech_601_footnotelibtech_602_footnoteand the contemplated so-called civil disobediencelibtech_603_footnotelibtech_604_footnotewithin should stop altogether. 
 
  Muslim 	League intrigues, 	said to be going on, 	with the Frontier tribes 	for creating 	disturbances in the 	Frontier Province and 	onward should also stop.  Frankly 	anti-Hindu legislation 	hurried through 	the sind Legislature 	in utter 	disregard of 	Hindu feeling 	and opposition 	should be abandoned.  The 	attempt that 	is being 	nakedly pursued in the 	Muslim majority 	provinces to pack 	civil and 	police services 	with Muslims irrespective 	of merit 	and to the deliberate 	exclusion of Hindus 	must be given 	up forthwith.  Speeches 	inciting to hatred, 	including murder, 	arson and loot, 	should cease.  Newspapers 	like the Dawn, 	Morning News, 	Star of India, 	Azad and 	others, whether in 	English or in 	any of 	the Indian 	vernaculars, should 	change their policy 	of inculcating 	hatred against the Hindus.  Private 	armies under the guise 	of National 	Guards, secretly or 	openly armed, should cease.  Forcible 	conversion, rape, abduction, arson and 	loot culmi- nating 	in murders 	of men, 	women and 	children by 	Muslims should 	stop.  What 	the Congress expects the 	Muslim League to 	do will readily 	be done 	in the 	fullest measure by 	the Congress.  What 	is stated 	here applies 	equally to 	the inhabitants of 	Princes’ India, 	Portuguese India and 	French India.

 praise for this scorched-earth policy and give it great importance. I am surprised that learned people there praise this policy.  But  somehow I do not as yet feel like saying anything in its favour. It is possible that my knowledge is limited in comparison to theirs. This trend is evident in our country as well. I see neither sacrifice nor bravery in eliminating the capitalists. If I were to know that the enemy were approaching I would leave my property intact instead of destroying it. I believe that would be true sacrifice and this is how love for humanity could be preserved in its noblest form. I claim that if we behave in this manner the enemy cannot but become our friend. A society as such cannot be treated separately from the individuals who constitute it. Truly speaking, we are all like brothers. At present the Government is trying to do its work as best as it can but it can refrain from doing so at will. Then the responsibility will fall on those men and women who constitute society. And if at that time we fail to realize that we are like brothers and to act as such, there may be chaos and anarchy and no one will benefit by it.

 If we are able to judge when to use a machine and when to avoid it and if while using it we do so with understanding, quite a few of our difficulties will be solved. For instance, if we are hurt tincture iodine (poisonous medicine) is applied to the affected part. But if we are down with fever we do not take tincture iodine orally. We should be as careful in using machines as a doctor is in prescribing poisonous medicines. Machine-power can make a valuable contribution towards economic progress. But a few capitalists have employed machine- power regardless of the interests of the common man and that is why our condition has deteriorated today.
 While talking with some friends today we discussed the idea of fitting rubber tyres in bullock-carts in our villages. I told them that to me it was clear that rubber tyres will not make things easy for the villagers; on the contrary they will increase their requirements and
 make them dependent on others. And this will become another means of their exploitation.

   TALK WITH WOMEN WORKERS libtech_606_footnote  
 BHANGI NIVAS, NEW DELHI
 April 10, 1947
 I would prefer women and men to work in separate fields. The work to be done among women is so much that sometimes owing to paucity of women workers men have to work in organizations meant exclusively for women. Our society has shown gross negli- gence towards women. We desperately need intelligent and service- minded women workers to work among them. However, I would advise you to keep it in mind that there should be no rivalry between men and women workers. Both and equally important and equally essential. There should be no secrecy between them. Their con- duct towards each other should also be natural and without inhibition.
 A number of workers who in the past were staunch believers in non-violence are, so to say, taking it lightly today. Even if people were to renounce and condemn non-violence, truth,  constructive programme and khadi, etc., I shall continue to proclaim my faith in them till my last breath, for I see no other way for India’s progress. No progress will be possible unless we make the requisite effort for implementing the constructive programme and learn to cultivate goodwill towards wrong-doers. Eminent persons have made experiments and invented armament but they fail to tempt me. With the increase in armament my conviction is becoming deeper that the power generated by non-violence is immense and incomparable. I have been a votary of this power for the last 30 years. I am not going to take this power lightly at a critical juncture as at present. Even if no one is with me I am my own companion.
 India has been disarmed against her will. But if everyone in India cultivates the courage to face death bravely, India can proclaim that she can defend herself and make progress not through the atom
 bomb but through non-violence along. Women alone can take the lead in this, for God has endowed them with great power.libtech_607_footnote
 Every village has to become self-reliant. Things required in a village should be produced in the village itself. Only under special circumstances should these be brought from outside. Every village should build schools, community halls and dharmashalas from money raised by the people from among themselves. If possible, even the artisans should be from the village itself. You should ensure that everyone in the village is provided with clean grain, clean water and a clean house. Under the Nayee Talim scheme education should be imparted to every child from beginning to end. Every activity should be conducted on a co-operative basis. Disputes should be settled amongst the villagers themselves. There should be no distinction of high or low castes in villages. A committee or panchayat consisting of five or seven elected adult men and women should be formed in each village. The panchayat should look after the public activities and act as the executive and legislature for the village.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       NEW 	DELHI 
  April 	10, 1947   BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	The bhajanlibtech_608_footnoteis 	as sweet as its meaning is sublime. If is of great significance to 	you as to all of us today. The essence of the bhajan is that 	even in the darkest hour we may not lose hope and faith. The lamp 	that is alight might go out and darkness spread around, but we must 	live through it. The flame that has ceased to burn, the life that is 	lost, these do not come back. Hindus and Muslims might take to the 	law of the jungle, but they ought to remember that they are not 	invertebrate animals but men standing erect. Hence even in the worst 	calamity they should not lose their faith and forget their dharma.     
 I have again received a number of letters today. A gentle- man writes to say that both Hindus and Muslims have turned into beasts. They are fighting each other. Is there no way out? There certainly is. The one simple way out of the situation is for either of the two communities to stop descending to the level of beasts. The correspondent, however, mentions one more thing. He says the important question is as to how the third party acts. He believes that the Viceroy has come here definitely to transfer power to Indian hands. If may be granted that he has come with sincere intentions; that the British have deputed this illustrious soldier of the royal family only to wind up their power spread far and wide in India and that the British Ministers responsible for deputing him are also honest in their purpose. But he still doubts the bona fides of the representatives of British commercial interests here. They had done everything to  exploit this land. Till this day they had monopolized all our trade. What would they do now? It is a pertinent question. If the Hindus and Muslims together wish to keep them, would they stay on as our friends or would the British businessmen force themselves on us even if we did not want them? There is also the hold of the Civil Service. They have come to have such a stranglehold over us that we are not sure whether we would get freedom at all. It was by the grace of God that we adopted certain methods and the circumstances too so changed that the British are not talking of leaving. But the Civil Service is still here and also the British soldiers. If they can earn their livelihood here, why should they leave?
 Another doubt is that the Viceroy’s offer might quietly be withdrawn. To this doubt I can only say that under the present circumstances we can say precious little. It is as yet only the dawn of freedom; the sun has not yet come up. We have no idea how warm the sun will be. At the moment we are shivering. Out hearts are full of fear. Only when the sun shines forth will we be able to feel its warmth. In this connection I want to say nothing to you. But I would appeal to the British in India, whether civilians, soldiers or businessmen, to leave India if they wish to preserve their good name. Till now they have been riding on our backs, which was not fair on their part. They had better climb down willingly. Lord Mountbatten has come here precisely to help them do it and he is not alone. He represents the full strength of the British people. Surely they will have to suffer some losses in doing it. But they are prepared for it. In fact they have already given some proof of their willingness. We said that the civil
 servants should go and they are leaving, they are going to inflict themselves on their own countrymen, that is, now it will be for Great Britain to pay them their pensions, etc. On the one hand Lord Mountbatten has summoned the Governors along with their secretaries to  be  briefed  about  the  true  state  of  affairs.libtech_609_footnotelibtech_610_footnoteOn  the  other   hand Churchill and his party will not give in without putting up resistance. Even then the Viceroy maintains that he represents the British people and as per their wish they should now withdraw. The Governors, the British commercial interests and members of the Civil Services should all help the Viceroy in this task and they should leave. Those who wish may stay on with pleasure. But they should act very differently from what they had hitherto been doing. In other words, instead of exploiting us they should help us prosper. They will leave behind a good name if they act in this manner.
 But news is pouring in from all quarters that their mischief was at the root of all these riots. Lord Mountbatten too has an inkling of it. He is afraid lest this popular suspicion should prove true. The British in India will now have to see to it that the suspicion of both Hindus and Muslims that the British has a hand in the riots is not substantiated. If this suspicion proves correct history will not spare them. It will be recorded in history that they were plunderers.
 But they can say let bygones be bygones and now they have turned over a new leaf. Lord Mountbatten is honest in his intention but his success is in the hands of the British commercial interests, the British army and the British civilians. If they are not sincere, whatever the Viceroy has done will be undone. Let us therefore pray to God to grant them good sense. Whatever the trouble in quitting India, even if they face a dark future ahead, still I would tell them that their good lies in deciding to leave India.
 Afterwards they can help us resolve our disputes, and they might even succeed in doing so. Then it will bring them good name. I pray to God that they quit India not as enemies but as true friends, and leave us to cherish friendship for them in our hearts.

  	I had several short talks with Pandit Nehru, and an hour’s talk 	with him alone, and then with several members of the Working 	Committee last night about the formulalibtech_613_footnoteI had sketched before you, and which I had filled in 	for them with all the implications.libtech_614_footnoteI  am sorry to say that I failed to carry any of 	them with me except Badshah Khan.  	I do not know that having failed to carry both the head and heart of 	Pandit Nehru with me I would have wanted to carry the matter 	further. But Panditji was so good that he would not be satisfied 	until the whole plan was discussed with the few members of the 	Congress Working Committee who were present.  	I felt sorry that I could not convince them of the correctness of my 	plan from every point of view. Nor could they dislodge me from my 	position although I had not closed my mind against every argument. 	Thus I have to ask you to omit me from your       
 consideration.
 Congressmen who are in the Interim Governmentlibtech_615_footnoteare stalwarts, seasoned servants of the nation and, therefore, so far as the Congress point of view is concerned, they will be complete advisers.
 I would still love to take the place that the late C. F. Andrews took. He represented no one but himself. And if you ever need my service on its merit, it will be always at your disposal.
 In the circumstances above mentioned, subject to your consent, I propose, if possible, to leave tomorrow for PATNA.
 I have not forgotten the book about tribal expeditions. I have not yet been able to lay my hands on it for I cannot recall the name of the author nor the year in which I read the book. As I told you it was years ago in S. Africa that I came across it. My search will continue wherever I am and as soon as I trace it, it shall be sent to you.
 I must also confess a slip of memory I am answerable for in the course of our talks. I was wrong in connecting Sir Francis Mudielibtech_616_footnotewith the late Pandit Nehrulibtech_617_footnote. The incident I referred to was in connection with Muddimanlibtech_618_footnote, not Mudie. The charge, almost universally believed by Congressmen against the present Governor of Sind, remains unaltered—in spite of my slip of memory.
 I hope these constant interviews are not proving an unbearable strain.libtech_619_footnote

 April 11, 1947
 Truly speaking, it was after I went to South Africa that I became what I am now. My love for South Africa and my concern for her problems are no less than for India, because it was in South Africa that  I discovered the weapon of satyagraha, and it was there that I offered a successful non-violent satyagraha. It encouraged me in my line of thought and strengthened my faith.
 India is now on the threshold of independence. But this is not the independence I want. To my mind it will be no independence if India is partitioned and the minorities do not  enjoy  security, protection and equal treatment. Because the independence of my dreams is altogether different. The country is not yet completely independent. If what is happening today is an earnest of things to come after independence, it bodes no good for the future. We have a proverb saying that the cradle bespeaks the child’s future. I, therefore, feel ill at ease. But I am content to leave the future in God’s good hands.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       NEW 	DELHI 
  April 	11, 1947   BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	I am sorry to have to inform you that today I have suddenly decided 	to leave for Bihar. You are aware that my field of work is Noakhali 	and Bihar. It is not that I have chosen these places. I went to 
 Noakhali just by chance or, say, at the call of God. I had to go to Bihar also in the same connection. I could accomplish something during the days I spent in Noakhali. The Hindus there smarting under the reign of terror had some respite. But just as I worked for the Hindus, I also worked for the Muslims there. Today it may not appear significant; but in future when the climate changes the country will realize the value of the work done there. In a way, some benefits of the work can be noticed even now. Even today good Muslims have come to accept their Hindu neighbour as their brothers. But the number of such people has not grown as much as it should. Even so, there is no doubt that the work that is being done there today will bring many benefits in the future.
 For the present I am needed not so much in Noakhali as in Bihar. I have a telegram from a Muslim friend from Bihar saying that I had stayed away from Bihar for a long time and should now return there. He says that they would feel reassured only when I go there. It is true that my decision to go to Bihar has not been prompted by this telegram. But now my mind has turned to Bihar because I had told them that I would do or die there.
 By “doing” I mean that the Hindus and Muslims of Bihar should live in amity like brothers. Even if there is frenzy raging like a fire elsewhere, the Hindus and Muslims of Bihar should live in amity. There are quite a few village in Bihar still untouched by the outside fire. Not only in Bihar but in Noakhali and the Punjab, where there has been so much trouble, there are some villages where people continue to live together in peace and with mutual trust. You will come across such village all over the country.
 You can turn round and tell me that just a couple of days ago I had talked of going to the Punjab. You can ask me why I now intend going to Bihar. You can also ask me if my talks with the Viceroy are over, as I had come here for that specific purpose. You can insist that if my talks with the Viceroy are over, I should wait at least to see the result. But why should I wait to see the result? It is not in my hands to produce any results. There are other people to take decisions in the matter. I wanted to discuss a few things with the Viceroy which I have already done. I had said earlier that in Delhi I was a prisoner of two persons, namely, the Viceroy and Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. Rajendra Babu had come to me. I have discussed the matter with him and also sent a message for Nehru. I have decided to go to Bihar with their
 permission.
 It is my svadharmalibtech_621_footnoteto go to Bihar. I worship the Gita. The  Gita ordains that one should perform one’s own duty and stick to one’s own field of action. The Gita clearly states that better is death in the discharge of one’s own duty and in one’s own field. Running after another’s function is fraught with danger. Hence, staying in a place like Delhi which is another’s domain is for me fraught with danger.
 If I had had a call from God directing me to go to the Punjab I would have certainly gone there. You may well ask me if it is God who prompts me. That way, God does not come to me in person. But I do hear an inner voice. One who becomes a devotee of God hears His voice from within. I did not hear such a voice with regard to the Punjab.
 But let me tell you that I have thought enough about going to the Punjab, and have come to the conclusion that my going there now would not serve any particular purpose, because we do not rule the Province. Even if the Muslim League had been ruling there, it would have meant our rule, because if the Muslim League members come to power there it would be on the strength of the votes of the people; and then it would be our rule. A rule established by the votes of the people would be the rule of the people. It is up to us to see whether such a rule brings happiness or unhappiness.
 Supposing it were our misfortune to have Hindu rule in one part of the country and a Muslim-ruled Pakistan in the other, if both the states take the attitude that the people of the other community may not live in peace inn their land, the Hindu state would become a hell and likewise Pakistan would be a  Na-Pakistanlibtech_622_footnote.  True  Pakistan  is  a place where there is proper justice, where there is no rule of force and where everything is done and achieved by effecting a change of heart in the opponents. But today we have forgotten our ideals.
 But whether I go to the Punjab or not, I shall certainly work for it. Whatever I want to tell the people after going there can as well be conveyed to them from outside the Punjab. I want to teach only one thing which I shall never tire of repeating. And it is that every Hindu and every Sikh should resolve that he would die, but would never kill. Master Tara Singh says the Sikhs shall kill. In my view what he says is not proper. He should say that if they do not get what they want they
 
 would die for it, even if they may be only a handful, and rest only when they had achieved their goal. He should not talk in terms of killing. I need not go all the way to the Punjab to say this.
 I could have conveyed my feelings to Bihar also from outside, but I feel that it is necessary to go there and persuade the people. For the same reason I went round in Noakhali. I was warned that I would be killed. But I tell you that even if all of you try to protect me you will not be able to save me from death. Even doctors and hakims would be of no avail. Even Hakim Lukman, quoted in today’s bhajanlibtech_623_footnote, says in despair that the grandeur of life is only transitory. Why then should we try to run away from death? We ought to face death with courage. We must conduct ourselves in such a way that the world would condemn those who would attack us. Let the whole world ask them how they would get Pakistan by adopting tyrannical means.
 The essence of satyagraha is that the satyagrahi converts the whole world to his view. I have said right from the beginning that we need not send our workers to the United States or to Britain to carry on propaganda for our cause. Truth will shine through our work right here and the whole world will come to witness it. In the same way I had won world sympathy while I was in South Africa and the British as well as Americans had upheld my stand.

 Once prejudice comes to dominate reason, it is difficult to get rid of it. I hold Guru Govind Singh in high esteem. Excuse me, but Imake bold to say that I am perhaps a truer follower of his than you all. Many of his bhajans are sung during prayers at the Ashram. But one cannot bring about any change in a person by law, it can be done only through persuasion. Therefore, no one can ever become non- violent through law. Violence is not obligatory under any religion, it is non-violence that is enjoined by all religions. But why don’t you understand that before asking others to respect one’s religion one must give due respect to every other religion? It is a pity I am unable to convince you about it today.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        NEW 	DELHI 
  April 	12, 1947    BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	Tomorrow is the last day of the national Week. April 6libtech_630_footnotewas the day of awakening. On that day we witnessed 	how the whole country was united. The towns in any case have a kind 	of unity without which they cannot function, but on that day we 	realized that India’s villages too were united.  	It is really remarkable that the villages should have been so 	united. I had appealed to the people to fast on April 6 and the 	whole nation followed my call. Who was I? But it was the voice of 	God. That        
 was why all the villages from Madras to the Punjab and from the Punjab to Dibrugarh in Assam were astir. India was awakened that day. April 13libtech_631_footnotewas the day of massacre in India. That was the day when Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs were all massacred indiscriminately in the Jallianwala Bagh. It was not really a baghlibtech_632_footnotelibtech_633_footnotebut an enclosure with walls on all four sides. It was not possible to escape from  the  enclosure, as there was only one small exit. Here unarmed people were slaughtered, bringing the death toll to two, or may be five, thousand. The blood of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs mingled at the place. No one could tell how much blood of which community way spilt there. If a blood sample were to be sent to the most experienced doctor even he could not have determined whether it belonged to a Hindu or a Sikh or a Muslim. In other words, all the Indians became fellow- martyrs in Jallianwala Bagh.
 Do not turn round and ask me how they could be called martyrs since they had not gone there with the intention of getting killed. It is true that they had not gone there prepared to meet death but they were all innocent people. Massacre of innocent people is a serious matter. It is not a thing to be easily forgotten. It is our duty to cherish their memory. So horrifying was the tragedy that the whole nation was moved. It provoked Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore to write a letterlibtech_634_footnoteto the Government and he joined our ranks. You have, therefore, to observe April 13 [as Martyrs’ Day]. I shall not be able to join you here tomorrow. I am not happy about it, but I have now decided to go to Bihar.
 It may be asked why I could not postpone my departure by a day. But, again, I am not going to Bihar for pleasure. There too I shall be serving India to the best of my capacity. As for fasting, it can be done even on the train. So, I shall be leaving today. You must fast tomorrow and observe April 13 in the same manner as you had observed April 6 on Sunday last.
 If you have properly understood everything that was said during these seven days, then those of you who have been coming here regularly should resolve tomorrow that you would die but never kill. Why should we say that we would die after killing? Why should we also say that we would have the courage to die only if we have a sword
 
 
 or a gun in our hands? Do you think it brings us any credit to say that we would have no fear if we had a gun with us, but would feel afraid without one? Let us discard lathis, swords and guns and go ahead with God as our companion. Free from fear let us then go everywhere and proclaim that we Hindus and Muslims would never indulge in mutual strife.
 But today we are fighting bitterly. I feel ashamed before the foreigners when they come to see me. Still I tell them that those who turn fanatics are only a few, that the entire population of 400 millions has not gone crazy and that I have full faith that a day would come when all the Indians would resolve to achieve their end not with the might of arms but with the strength of reason. If India desires true freedom, everybody should learn this lesson.
 Another thing I want to tell you is that however loud  our protests might be, our Press refuses to mend its ways. Today one of the newspapers has gone to the extent of stating that Gandhi is going away because of his differences with the Congress Working Committee, and now he is not able to get along with the Working Committee. This comment has appeared not in some small, insignificant paper but in a leading paper with a large circulation. I feel ashamed to see how low our newspapers have sunk.
 I have explained to you yesterday why I am going and that is the real truth. What the newspaper says, despite my explanation, is sheer nonsense. I am going, no doubt; but there is no quarrel among us. Our relations are no less cordial. Maulana Saheb was here a little while ago. Rajaji, the Sardar, Nehru and Kripalani were also here. We were all talking amicably. Only Rajendra Babulibtech_635_footnotelibtech_636_footnotehad  not  come;  but does his absence mean that he had quarrelled with me? Isn’t all this gossip mischievous? It can certainly be said that we have our differences. But was there any time when we had no differences? Such differences have always been there. Even father and son have their own differences. But this paper is not merely hinting at  our differences ; it clearly says that we have fallen out.
 If I were going because of any quarrel, why should I have gone to seek permission from the Viceroy? Why did I take permission from Nehru and Kripalani? I would have just gone away without consulting anyone.
Not only that, the Sardar asked me a little while ago about my
 return. I replied that I would be back the moment I heard his  summons. Would I talk that way if we had quarrelled? If I choose to be a rebel I can be a pretty tough one. If I would not listen to anyone neither would I do violence to anyone nor persecute anyone.
 But it is a trick of their trade to create panic among the people and thus increase their sales. It is a very wicked thing to indulge in order to fill this wretched tummy. I have also been a journalist and in those African jungles where there was none to bother about  the Indians I had done a lot of journalistic work. If for earning their livelihood these people fill the pages of their newspapers and thereby harm the interests of India, then, they must give up journalism and find some other occupation for their livelihood. In the English language the Press is called the Fourth Estate. The Press can help or harm the country in so many ways. If the newspapers do not maintain a healthy attitude, what purpose would be served by India becoming free?
 We too have developed such a habit that we can do without the Koran, without the Gita or the Ramayana, but we cannot do without the newspapers in the morning. Even great men have become slaves to the newspaper [habit]. If we do not get our morning paper we are upset. The newspapermen have also created this dependence on the papers by indulging in unfounded gossip. But all this gossip hardly serves any purpose.
 I would suggest that you throw away such useless newspapers. If you want to get news you can enquire from people. You are not going to lose anything by not reading the newspapers. If you must read a newspaper take care to choose those which are published to serve the interest of the country and call upon Hindus and Muslims to live in amity. Then the journalists too would not be in such a mad rush to work overnight and also forgo their rest during daytime. Then there would be no rush for giving publicity to baseless rumours.
 If good journalists happen to hear about any quarrel between Gandhi and Nehru or Kripalani and Maulana Azad, they must first verify it with Gandhi or Nehru before rushing to print it. Had they come to us to verify it, we would have rebuked them sternly for talking nonsense.
 Today a Muslim friend has sent me a nice letter. A Hindu friend has also written me a nice thing. The Muslim friend writes to say that Satavlekarji’s interpretation of the verse from the Ishopanishad is
 indeed sublime. Similar is the meaning of the verse Auz-o-Billahi, etc. There is no difference between the two, only, one is in Sanskrit and the other in Arabic.
 My Hindu friend has asked me why, while I regard the Koran as a scripture, the Muslims do not similarly regard the Gita and the Upanishads. Why don’t they recite from these in the mosques?
 The answer is clear. As a true Hindu I regard the Koran as a book of religion because it contains words that praise Khuda. But what is the logic in forcing Muslims to regard our scriptures also as their books of religion? This would not be an act of goodness.
 I hope to meet you again. I shall come back when Jawaharlal or Kripalani or the Viceroy sends for me. I shall continue to work for you and for the people of the Punjab, Bihar and Noakhali also. You should always continue your prayers with the same devotion as you have been doing all these days.

   NOTE ON GRAMSUDHAR TRUST, URULI-KANCHANlibtech_639_footnote  
 ON  THE TRAIN  TO PATNA,
 April 13, 1947
 The local Trust for Uruli may be kept separate from the original Trust.libtech_640_footnotelibtech_641_footnoteOnly then will you be able to carry on rural reconstruction activities under it. Among these you may include farming, cow- rearing, weaving, running indigenous oil-mills, etc. The Trust will be called Gramsudharlibtech_642_footnotelibtech_643_footnoteTrust. Nature cure will be a part of its activities. All the activities should be mentioned in the Trust deed. You may ask Mangaldas Pakvasa to prepare the draft. Get it done soon. Even Balkrishnalibtech_644_footnotelibtech_645_footnotemay prepare it. I leave to the local workers the decision whether the Trust should be an independent one or a sub-trust of the original Trust. If you wish to have an independent trust, you will have to be ready to stand on your  own feet and shoulder all the responsibility. If you make a sub-trust, you will have to work within the framework of the original Trust’s constitution. You will not, then, be able to take up rural reconstruction programme.
 The trustees will be, beside myself, Dr. Dinshaw and Jehangirji (if they are willing to be included among the Trustees of an independent   Trust),   Maganbhai,   Gulabilibtech_646_footnotelibtech_647_footnote,   Balkrishna   and   a   local worker, provided he is capable, Balkrishna will have to agree to be one of the Trustees. Maganbhai is not one of the Trustees of the original Trust. He has been included only on the Uruli Trust.
 If farming, cow-rearing, running  indigenous oil-mills and similar activities are to be carried on through the Trust, they will have to be self-supporting. You will have to be ready to run them all [in that manner]. I should be happy if you can do without bullocks. For goseva work, you should utilize the services of resi- dents of the village. Our methods of work ought not to be like those of capitalists. You may employ local workers who have the spirit of service in them for farming, cow-rearing and indi- genous oil-mills, etc. The other family members of these workers should also give their services. Oil-
 engines must not be used.
 For all these activities, you may get the money from Sevagram. I will give a note to Chimanlallibtech_648_footnotelibtech_649_footnote.  You  cannot  use  the  money  of  the original Trust. And the expenditure should not exceed one lakh rupees. If patients from the village do not seek admission to the hospital, you may admit outsiders. Local patients should get priority and the expenses on their treatment also should be borne by the institution. You may fix a fee for patients from outside. The standard of treatment for everybody will be simple. This should be laid down among the objects of the Trust. If any men or women workers from outside wish to join, they may come and stay in a spirit of service. They cannot be paid any remuneration. Menial staff should be employed from amongst the villagers and should be paid. You may engage ten or twelve-year old children from the village and pay them, and also arrange to teach them according to the Wardha Scheme. Get a few service-minded workers from outside. Train some servants and children from the village and admit only as many patients as you can easily look after. The workers will be subject to the Ashram rules. For the servants, you may frame lighter rules. There will be bye-rules relating to such matters. If, after his marriage, Paramanand starts an establishment of his own, we will pay him just enough to meet his expenses. We may pay something to Gokhale, too, if he needs it. Fix the amount in consultation with Balkrishna. The equipment for the hospital should also be very simple. It would, of course, be best if you got it made in the village itself. For tubs, you can even use large containers made of baked earth. Or you can get them made of tin. For beds, you may arrange bricks to form the four legs and place a plank over them. This is merely by way of a suggestion. I am of the view that non-vegetarian food has no place in the treatment. I am not here looking at the matter from a religious point of view. Instead of tea, you may serve Indian-style decoction. In any case, wheat coffee will do. We cannot supply bidis. Don’t mind if persons addicted to these things do not come for treatment. Try to explain the reasons to the people. Patients suffering from tuberculosis, leprosy and other contagious diseases may be admitted if there is provision for separate accommodation for them. Non-violent honey should be extracted in the village itself. Teach the local Vagharanlibtech_650_footnotelibtech_651_footnotethe improved method of extracting honey. You may even start bee-keeping. Make arrange-
 ments to supply cow’s milk and ghee. But in the absence of cow’s milk, you can supply buffalo’s or goat’s milk.
 You may send for Hoshiraribehn after she completes her education. For preserving good health, more expenditure may be incurred if necessary. Every inmate of the Ashram must put in at least seven years of total work. I would not like anybody to be permitted to cook his or her own meals. Decide about the Ashram rules after discussion with Balkrishna. I will write about the subject when I get time. It would be better if Bhagwatlibtech_652_footnotegives up the idea of visiting other centres for the present.
 The additional expenditure on account of the current construction work should also be obtained from Sevagram.  The money may be kept in the custody of Dr. Mehta, if he agrees. It would, however be better to keep it with a respectable banker in Uruli. There is no need just now to call any meeting of the Trustees which I must attend. This should be enough.

 are frequent difference between your approach and mine. Such being the case, would it be advisable for me to meet the Viceroy even as an individual?
 Please think over this objectively, keeping only the good of the country in view. If you like, you may discuss the matter with others. Please do not see the slightest suggestion of a complaint from me in this. I am thinking of my duty in terms of the country’s good. It is quite possible that what you can see while administering the affairs of millions may not be realized by me. If I were in the place of you all, I would perhaps say and do exactly what you are saying and doing.

 CHI. BALKRISHNA,
I had a long talk with Manibhai.libtech_656_footnote
 I understand about Manu. The consideration of possible effect of an act on others is not important in itself. It has only relative validity. And if we pay exclusive attention to it, we can make no progress. It is, of course, necessary to be sure that there is no trace of hypocrisy or untruth or pride in the reformer. More than this I need not say just now.
 The burden of Uruli will be entirely on Manibhai and you. Of course, Dr. Bhagwat, Dhirubhailibtech_657_footnotelibtech_658_footnoteand Gokhale are there. But they have to begin from the beginning Even if they join, only the two of you will be there to serve till your last breath. If there is temperamental incompatibility among the workers or if they lack the qualities required for running institution, it is bound to fail. About you, too, I have one condition, namely, regarding your health. Manibhai will tell you all about that.
 He will also tell you about my limitations at present. I see no possibility of being able to free myself from them in the immediate future.

I  have an  impression  that   I   have already  	written      
 something to you. Or have I omitted to write? If your insistence on certain policies had raised you high and if it is now pulling you down, you should take it that basically your insistence was obstinacy and that you had not at all risen high. There are some big men who hold this view. They think that the teaching of non-violence has proved disastrous. They believe that the way of the spinning-wheel would only take us back to the medieval ages. They think the same of village industries and Nayee Talim. Could it not be that there was something basically wrong with me which led me to have a misguided view of things all through? However, my views are the same as they have, always been.

 It is futile to argue in terms of ifs and buts. It is wrong to say that it would have been better if such and such a thing had been done in such and such a way.

Hence I bring God into the picture.

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_671_footnote 
 
 
PATNA,
  April 	14, 1947   BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	You maintained good silence during the prayer. Kindly remain as 	peaceful till I finish speaking. In the first place I must tell you 	about my journey. Things went on smoothly right from Delhi so that  	I could sleep comfortably throughout the night. Even though a big 	crowd had gathered at Kanpur the people were peaceful. I was fast 	asleep and did not know about the gathering. It was all very 	peaceful till I reached the Bihar border, but with my entry into 	Bihar the disturbances began. This was so at least in my view. I can 	sleep even during the day if only people would let me. I had work to 	do and I went on doing it. I would ask the Biharis not to behave in 	the manner they did. There is a limit even to love. It serves no 	purpose going beyond a limit. Love should not be expressed in such a 	way as to upset the other person.  	I had gone to Delhi to meet the Viceroy. I discussed with him many 	things. He seems to be a man of honest intentions. He kept repeating 	that he was the last Viceroy and that he would be in office only 	till 30th June next year. But this does not mean that he has nothing 	to do till then. He is preparing for his departure. It is my 	impression that he is keen on going, whether or not we continue to 	fight among ourselves. The British have ruled us for more than a 	century. They have given us education, but have we learnt only to 	quarrel? On the one hand our independence is approching and on the 	other we continue to fight among ourselves. A good deal of 	discussions were held in Delhi. Panditji, Rajaji, Vallabhbhai and 	all others are trying to think of ways and means to consolidate our 	independence which we are about to attain. They are making efforts 	so that there may be peace and calm in the country and the defects 	of foreign rule may be removed.  	People ask me why I did not go to the Punjab. All I can say in reply 	is that I can neither go nor refrain from going anywhere at 	somebody’s bidding. For this I need a call from within, in other 	words, the inner voice. There were quite a few people who said that 	I should go and as many advised to the contrary. I listened to both 	the views. But then my inner voice told me that my work lay in Bihar 	and Noakhali. “Better is death”, it is said, “in the discharge 	of one’s  
 duty, another’s duty is fraught with danger.” The Gita says that one’s duty, however small, is better than another’s, however great. I felt that I should come here, and so I consulted the Viceroy, Panditji and other leaders. This does not mean that I shall never go to the Punjab. I shall go there when I feel I should.
 I had said at Noakhali that I would either do or die. Maybe I will die, not in Noakhali but in Bihar, or, I might die not even in Bihar but in the Punjab. It would be just as well if I succeed in Noakhali, for it would have its good effect all round. If the Hindus and the Muslims of Bihar tell me that my work here is over and that I should leave, then  I shall go to Noakhali. Those Muslims who are writing abusive letters to me should be able to say that although the Hindus have misbehaved they would not do so any more. If these Muslims feel reassured, they would certainly be able to say so. Let the Hindus of Noakhali also say the same thing. When I was in Delhi, the Muslims of Bihar were asking me why I did not go to Bihar. It pained me that they did not say that they had restored brotherly relations with the Hindus and I need not go to Bihar. And now, what about Noakhali? Suhrawardy Saheb says that because Gandhi released to the Press so many telegrams  it probably led to the communal explosion in Calcutta. What Satis Babu has written makes everything clear. It is another matter if the charges are false and cannot be proved. But if they are true, it will be known to everyone. What is the point in hiding the guilt? It would be better if the newspapers publish the outrages committed by both Hindus and Muslims. People should know who has committed what crime. This will show what is the truth and what is the untruth and the poison will come to the surface. Just now people only make guesses while the poison works within. Suhrawardy Saheb says that his officers give him such reports. This is not a good practice. This is what the British too used to say. They also used to believe their officers’ reports that all was well. The officers in Bihar and Bengal have given similar reports, but they are not reliable. Satis Babu and Suhrawardy Saheb are old friends. Satis Babu used to go round with him during the disturbances in Calcutta. Whatever he says is only after proper investigation. It is not right to say that he gives wrong information. He gives full details of arson and looting. It is futile to say that these are lies. Because Noakhali and came here to serve the Muslims I have a right to go on a fast. When I was in Bengal I had said that I would undertake a fast unto death if the riots in Bihar did not stop.libtech_672_footnotelibtech_673_footnoteI have a similar right [to
 fast] on behalf of the Hindus of Noakhali. But it is not easy to undertake a genuine fast. I do not mean that I am going to undertake a fast right from today. It will please me very much if the reports sent to me about Noakhali are proved exaggerated and Suhrawardy Saheb in right in saying that the Hindus have not suffered any loss. But what would happen to me if the fear proves will-founded and something happens to the Hindus who have stayed on on the assurance from Satis Babu and Haran Babu? I have told everyone that I would go to Noakhali, so I shall have to do something. Surely I cannot take poison nor hang or shoot myself. I can end my life only by fasting. Suhrawardy Saheb says the Hindus are in a minority in Bengal but the difference in the numbers of the Hindus and the Muslims is very small. The proportion may be 55 to 45 per cent. The Hindus of West Bengal have decided that Bengal should be divided. If I were in Suhrawardy Saheb’s place I would have gone to the Hindus and asked them not to have any fears. I would have asked them what  their trouble was. Why do the Hindus want separation? Let him satisfy them. You may have Pakistan or Hindustan, but it is wrong if the Hindus say that they would force the Muslims to stay on. And if the Muslims say that they would achieve their goal by resorting to force I would say that they would not get an inch of land from us. I would tell them they could turn the whole of India into Pakistan by persuading us and converting us to their view. I had said the same thing in Delhi. But what can we do in a situation as at present? Shall we also resort to violence? No, we shall lay down our lives, but we shall not let them have their way by force.
 Bengal entered its New Year yesterday. India has a number of New Year days. I expect a day will come when the whole of India will observe the same New Year Day. By the grace of God  may  the Bengali New Year bring peace and comfort to the whole of Bengal. In the coming New Year the Hindus should learn new things. They should learn to die. They should learn to die not while engaged in plunder and arson but while pursuing dharma and serving others, for service of man is service unto God. Let all Bengalis learn this. The Muslims do not follows the Bengali year now. At one time they used to follow it. But even if only the Hindus of Bengal learn to follow the new path from the New Year, I would say it would be for the benefit of all and they to would stand to gain by it.

  TALK WITH MUSLIM LEAGUE MEMBERS 
 April 14, 1947
 I firmly believe that if only the British quit India, we would almost be united. Why cannot the Muslim League see that the first thing for all is to end India’s slavery? We may talk about partition after that. Either the Muslims regard India as their home or they do not. If they do, then this senseless massacre of innocent people should stop, the British should be made to quit and our own Government set up. We can then settle the question of partition by mutual persuasion or fight it out amongst ourselves, if necessary. But I do not understand why thousands of innocent people are being killed treacherously. And if the Muslims do not regard India as their home, the question of Pakistan does not arise.
 The Muslim League friends replied that they also condemned such killings.
 Bapu said:
 Then you should issue a statement to that effect on behalf of the local Muslim League and write to Jinnah Saheb. That would be true service rendered to the Muslim League, and thus you will not subjected to unwarranted suspicion.libtech_674_footnote

  LETTER TO A TEACHERlibtech_675_footnote 
 April 15, 1947
 Students must not be given corporal punishment. But there should be such a rapport between the teacher and the taught that if the teacher punishes himself in some way the children, because of their affection for him, should feel sorry, their hearts should melt and they should change for the better. I am not talking in the air. This has been my personal experience. Mothers also can reform their children in the same way. In South Africa I had looked after Hindu, Muslim and Parsi boys and girls. During those days I remember having only once beaten a pupil.libtech_676_footnotelibtech_677_footnoteBut it was my experience that my non-violent method was more successful. If the children have affection for their teacher
 
 they are bound to feel sorry when they find the teacher suffering on their account. That would soften them. But if in spite of that there is a difficult pupil, we should non-co-operate with him. But that is another method. The former is the better method.

 Socialism is a term of the modern age but the concept of socialism is not a new discovery. Lord Krishna preaches the same doctrine in the Gita. One need have in one’s possession only what one requires. It means that all men are created by God and therefore entitled to an equal share of food, clothing and housing. If does not require huge organizations for the realization of this ideal. Any individual can set about to realize it. First of all in order to translate this ideal into our lives we should minimize our needs, keeping in mind the poorest of the poor in India. One should earn just enough to support oneself and one’s family. To have a bank balance would thus be incompatible with this ideal. And whatever is earned should be earned with the utmost honesty. Strict restraint has to be kept over small matters in our lives. Even if a single individual enforces this ideal in his life, he is bound to influence others. Wealthy people should act as trustees of their wealth. But if they are robbed of this wealth through violent means, it would not be in the interest of the country. This is known as communism. Moreover, by adopting violent means we would be depriving society of capable individuals.

  A TALK 
 GANDHI CAMP PATNA ,
 April 15, 1947
 There is a highly sensitive balance in science for weighing minute particles of dust and even a hair can be weighed by it. We should have a similar balance that would indicate even a hair-like minute slip in the observance of truth and non-violence. We have to put ourselves to this test and pass it. It does not therefore behove a man of non-violence to imagine anything about  another  person. There is no reason to believe that anyone who criticises us must be against us. For example, if misunderstanding crops up between two friends or brothers, they do not cease to be brothers or friends. There are many instances like this. For example, water is two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. Still we should experiment both ways by separating the elements and integrating them again, and if as a result we get water only then our inference about water will be regarded as correct. Similarly, in our everyday life on many occasions  what appears clear as daylight may turn out to be an illusion. We decidedly violate truth and non-violence if we draw an inference without making proper enquiries. Having taken the vow of truth and non-violence we have to be extremely cautious and alert at every moment. I meet Rajas and Maharajas with due respect and welcome them, in spite of my knowledge of their numerous shortcomings. They are themselves not responsible for them, it has become their nature owing to the circumstances. We can change them only through love and then alone will they accept us as their friends; thus on several occasions they were ready on their own for atonement.
 You know that Deenabandhu Andrews used to be treated with discourtesy by Government officials. But in spite of that he continued to visit them off and on with the result that some of them came to
 
 regret their conduct. Only if I succeed in my experiment in truth and non-violence here amongst you can I go to the Punjab and Sind and then I am bound to achieve success everywhere. Therefore one who has embraced non-violence should always be vigilant and constantly examine himself.
 Pointing to the figurine of three monkeys Gandhiji said:
 This guru of mine always teaches me never to see evil in others. That is why it has its eyes closed. The other one has closed its ears because one should hear no evil of others. [The third one] has closed its mouth because one should neither speak evil of others nor utter a single word which might hurt anyone.

  TALK WITH SYED JAFAR IMAMlibtech_679_footnote 
 April 15, 1947
 Gandhiji told him that if there was an order that the League volunteers should leave the camp, they should do so, otherwise it would be very difficult for him to plead for them with the Government.
 JAFAR IMAM: We bow before your affection. The Government wants to remove the League from the camp in order to destroy its influence amongst the refugees. That would render the refugees helpless and force them to go back under pressure of Government threat. We feel that to attempt to weaken our organization in this fashion is not proper.
 Gandhiji assured him that no one could destroy the influence of the League that way. He had even declared that he would gladly have Jinnah as the first President of free India. He had no quarrel with the League though it regarded him as its enemy. Such things only amused him. He related how in Delhi a Muslim League leader had openly declared him to be an enemy of the Muslims, but the wife of this gentleman with her sister came and had a friendly and cordial talk with him the next day. If he was sincere, he added, others were bound to understand him one day. They had fallen on evil days but he had full faith in God.
GANDHIJI: Then let us meet again and discuss the whole affair.
 JAFAR IMAM: We are all going to Delhi and will not be back till the 20th
 April.
 
GANDHIJI: Then depute somebody who can act on your behalf.
 JAFAR IMAM: There will be nobody here. You kindly get the order stayed till
  the 	20th. When we are back we shall discuss the matter with you and 	arrive at a decision.  GANDHIJI: I shall talk 	the matter over with the Ministers, and understand their point of 	view. If after talking to them I feel that your volunteers should 	leave, will they do so?  JAFAR 	IMAM: We pray that you 	don’t go there. If somebody misbehaves, if would be very painful 	to us. We would not like you to be disobeyed.  One 	of Gandhiji’s secretaries intervened at this stage and explained 	that the Government order only for the time being was that the 	volunteers would not get Government rations or be allowed to sleep 	there. The order applied equally to all volunteers and was not 	directed against any particular community or organization.  JAFAR 	IMAM: Night is the only 	time when women and children require protection.  GANDHIJI: Suppose I or 	any of my representatives  goes  and sleeps there, would it not 	serve the purpose?  JAFAR 	IMAM: We do not want you 	to take this trouble upon yourself at this  age. 	We would only request you to get this order stayed till the 20th. 	That would prevent many unnecessary complications.   Mahatma 	Gandhi—The Last Phase, Vol. 	I, Bk. II, pp. 323-4   
   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING      PATNA, 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  April 	15, 1947 
  	While I was in Delhi I had received many letters from Bihar, some 	containing abuses, some in praise and few expressing doubt whether I 	would at all return to finish the work in Bihar or whether I had 	forgotten all about Bihar. The doubt expressed  has  no foundation. 	He who follows his own dharma commits no mistake. Praise is wholly 	unnecessary for him; dharma for him is a duty. One must return a 	hundredfold what one receives.  	We must put up with the abuses hurled at us. They do not affect me. 	Do or Die is my motto and I must lay down my life doing my work 	wherever it might be. Some persons have accused me of leaving 	Noakhali and coming to Bihar not at the request of a Hindu but at 	the 
 behest of a Muslim so that the Muslims may do what they like in Noakhali. But you know I have come here at the invitation of Dr. Mahmud. He is the son-in-law of the late Mazhar-ul-haq and is an able person. He has rendered great service to the Congress and has been a member of the Congress Working Committee. I knew his father-in-law Mr. Mazhar-ul-Haq even before I had heard of Rajendra Babu or Brijkishore Babu. He was my fellow-student in England. I had come to Bihar at the instance of Rajkumar Shukla and my prior acquaintance with Mazhar-ul-Haq proved to be a great advantage. I have known Dr. Mahmud since the days when there was no Hindu- Muslim tension of the sort which has now developed. I have come here at his invitation for he is an old friend of mine. According to me, by summoning me here Dr. Mahmud has done good both to the Hindus and Muslims. Bihar after all is my land, it has made me. My coming here is not a new thing. I have worked here and have become attached to it. My attachment to it is as pure as to a mother. It is true I have come here at the instance of Muslims but it is sheer folly to say that Muslims are devils and have drawn me away from Noakhali to do what they please there. How is it possible for Dr. Mahmud, who has done so much work and whose father-in-law has served the country so well, to do any such thing? Are all the Muslims in the world bad? Muslims also may say that all the Hindus are bad. So long as there is even one good man in the world the world belongs to the good. If everyone turns evil, the world will go to Satan. But Satan has no real existence. In fact Satan is a name or evil. On reflection we will realize that even if there is one good man the world will go on as a result of his noble endeavour.
 I stay in Dr. Mahmud’s house and all the persons in my party are treated as members of his family. Mr Muztuwa, Dr. Mahmud’s secretary, takes great care to make us feel at home. Both Dr. Mahmud and Qaiyum are your ministers. Are they good for nothing? If you recognize that they are not true servants of the Congress you may remove them but they have been chosen by Hindu ministers. Ministries can be formed without Muslims being included if no honest Muslim is available: but it would be dishonesty not to have them when honest Muslims are available. Our good lies in taking all good men along with us. The Muslim League people who met me also say that non-League Muslims are not their enemies. The Bihar Muslim League President, Jafar Imam, is in fact a good friend of Dr.  Mahmud. Badshah Khan is also a Muslim but he is a fakir. Khudai Khidmatgars
 are also Muslims but they have given complete protection to  the Hindus though the Hindus there are fewer even than the Muslims here.
 People may write to me what they like but this you must understand, that whatever may be the deterioration in the situation in the Punjab, Bengal and Sind, Hinduism will be saved if Bihar at any rate follows the right path. Even if the Muslims in the Punjab, Bengal and Sind harm the Hindus there, and if Bihar shows true courage in protecting and comforting Muslims and their children, Bihar will have raised India in the estimation of the world.
 To protect the minorities is not to appease them. This I expect from Bihar by right of service and because of its people’s deep devotion to Rama. I have been constantly on the move but the doctors have advised me not to tour in this heat; they want me to go to a cooler place during summer, but I shall tour as long as my health permits. The tours will have to be curtailed. A lot of work remains to be done in Patna. I do not want to leave in a hurry.
 I have many more things to tell you. But since these things must be properly explained I shall try to tell them tomorrow or some other day.libtech_680_footnote

Courtesy: 	Lilavati Asar     A TALKlibtech_681_footnote   PATNA,  April 	16, 1947  	The way to true repentance lies in making a firm resolve not to soil 	one’s hand with evil in future. If ever again you happen  to 	commit a wrong you should not sleep over your confession. If is 	human to err. Therefore one is bound to commit an error, but that in 	itself is not a very grave matter. The danger lies in hiding that 	error. When a person resorts to untruth to hide his error he commits 	another folly. If one continues to make mistakes one after another, 	it can be very harmful. If there is an abscess in the body, one can 	press it and remove the pus. But if the poison is not removed and it 	spreads in the body it may result in death. The same in true of a  	person  who  commits a sin but does not confess it. A sinner may 	commit many sins but if at the last moment there is sincere 	repentance, God forgives him. One should pray for the well-being not 	only of human beings but of all creatures, which also are the 	creation of God. And the only way to attain this strength is to 	meditate upon God morning and evening. The prayer for the welfare of 	all includes our welfare as well. [From 	Gujarati]  Biharni 	Komi Agman, pp. 	209-10     SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING   April 	16, 1947   BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	I can only tell you this today. While I was in Delhi I met the 	Viceroy a number of times. I also met him just before coming here. 	He showed me an appeallibtech_682_footnotewhich he wanted me to sign. I told him I     
 could do so with the consent of Pandit Nehru and the Congress President. Quaid-e-Azam Jinnah was also to sign it. The purport of the appeal was that we are both in agreement that the recent acts of lawlessness and violence have brought the utmost disgrace to the fair name of India and the greatest misery to innocent people and unleashed a reign of terror everywhere. We are not to consider who were the aggressors and who the victims. We denounce for all time the use of force to achieve political ends and we call upon all the communities of India, to whatever persuasion they may belong, not only to refrain from all acts of violence and disorder but also to avoid both in speech and writing any word which might be construed as an incitement to such acts.
 To obtain my signature on such an appeal is not of very great significance, for I have all along been saying the same thing and will go on repeating it. But it is significant that the Quaid-e-Azam has also signed it. Everyone should now take care that riots do not take place. Though they break out even now we have now a right to expect that the riots will not occur in future. The Muslim League people are also here. They can assure me that my work has been completed and that I could now return and resume my work. My signature was not necessary at all, for I represent nobody. I am your servant because I have served Bihar. It is for you to tell me that having committed a sin once your will not repeat it. You may ask me why Pandit Nehru and Kripalani did not sign the appeal. I do not want to go into this matter but you must realize the significance of my signature. It will be very bad if you now kill any Muslim. It should not be that you applaud me and kill innocent people. Such applause would be my undoing. How long would you applaud me?
 I had said the other daylibtech_683_footnotelibtech_684_footnotethat I had a right to undertake a fast on behalf of Bihar but after coming here I have earned a similar right in case of Noakhali also. It is a different matter if I do  not  go  to Noakhali or don’t exercise my right. But the Hindus and Muslims of Noakhali must know that I have got that right and I may sacrifice my life for them. I have also received an anonymous telegram which says that if I have to go on a fast I should do so immediately. But I do not act at other people’s bidding. I shall undertake a fast when my inner voice prompts me to do so, for the inner voice is the voice of God. I have signed the Viceroy’s appeal. The implication of my signature is that I shall be responsible if Hindu-Muslim riots break out anywhere in India. I have no power, no army, I have only my life which I can sacrifice. I do not represent the Hindus. I claim that all religions are equal. You just heard in the prayer about equality of religions, which
 means all religions are equal and I shall have to atone for the crimes committed by the people irrespective of their religions. I have taken a tremendous responsibility on my shoulders. You should realize my responsibility; Hindus and Muslims should live like brothers for ever.  I can make a similar claim on behalf of Shri Jinnah also. Today he speaks for the Muslims alone but there was a time when he was regarded as a representative of the whole country. He was a Congressman and had a high position in the Congress. He had put up a brave fight against the Governor of Bombay single handed and the latter had to yield.libtech_685_footnotelibtech_686_footnoteThe Jinnah Hall in Bombay stands as a memorial to his good name. He can speak for everyone even today because the appeal is addressed to all the communities irrespective of their faiths.
 I would also appeal to the Press to refrain from publishing reports which would incite one against another. A great burden has fallen both upon Shri Jinnah’s shoulders and mine, since the appeal has been signed only by the two of us. Had the appeal been signed by 25 persons the burden would have been less. It is now the duty of every Hindu and Muslim to realize this and explain it to others.
 The Viceroy has taken a very good step; we must thank him for it. But it would have been much better had Shri Jinnah and I drafted the appeal jointly and signed it. It would then have been a great thing. But the Viceroy who is an outsider had to initiate it. How good it would be if we agreed to act upon it ! How great would India’s reputation be ! Let us bear no more ill-will against each other nor hurt others by any thought, word or deed of ours. Lest the world should look down upon us we should not profess one thing and practise another. We should admit our mistake and decide not to lose our heads again.
 My understanding of the situation is that the Congress and the League should together open a new chapter. It would have been excellent if they could have arrived at an agreement without the intervention of a third party. However, I hope there would be no enmity or misunderstanding between the Congress and the League even if they were brought together through the good offices of the Viceroy.

  TALK WITH WOMEN WORKERS 
 GANDHI CAMP PATNA ,
 April 17, 1947
 You should have faith in yourselves and in God and thus build up your self-confidence and courage. Everyone frightens the timid. Therefore if you continue to be timid you will not be able to make any use of the strength with which God has blessed you, the strength t cultivate courage in oneself. In order to utilize your strength you have to realize the power inherent in you.
 God only knows who invented the word  abalalibtech_687_footnotefor the women of India. To call them abala is to condemn the inherent strength of women; in my view it is an insult to them. If we peruse the history of the Rajput, Mughal or Mahabharata period of our country we shall come across marvellous instances of bravery shown by women. They not only exhibited their bravery through arms, but by building up their moral courage they developed immense strength. If women resolve to bring glory to the nation, within a few months they can totally change the face of the country because  the  spiritual background of an Aryan woman is totally different from that of the women of other countries.
 We hear reports, not only from Bihar or Noakhali, but from everywhere about goondas having molested or abducted women. I feel terribly upset hearing such sorry tales. I wonder why our women have become so timid. Their glory has been diminishing and for this you women are yourselves responsible. You should have such boundless faith in God, as Draupadi and Sita had. You should get rid of the distinctions of Hindu, Mussalman, Parsi or Jew. Follow the religion which appeals to you. Who are the persons who violate the honour of women? Are they not your brother, father or son? After all they are all our countrymen, aren’t they? You should restrain your menfolk from committing such atrocities and warn them that if they violated any Muslim woman it would be tantamount to violating your honour, because she is after all your sister. But today even women have stopped thinking on these lines. Instead, some women take pride in their son, brother, father or husband killing or molesting other women. I have seen a number of such cases. But remember that those
 
 who are dishonouring other women today will treat you in the same way tomorrow. As a result even a brother and sister might be forced to follow immoral ways. As I see it, this will be the outcome of the massacre that is going on. I do not wish to live to witness thing. I would plead with you not to become an instrument in  dragging India’s ancient culture into the mire. You are only twelve or fifteen but you are all workers. If you can carry my voice, I would like to convey my anguish to every woman in the country.

  TALK WITH CONGRESS WORKERSlibtech_688_footnote 
 GANDHI CAMP PATNA ,
 April 17, 1947
 Only this morning I poured out my anguish before some sisters. I did not expect that you also would be the cause of similar pain. It is  a bad habit with us that whenever we call a meeting to discuss some work, we start indulging in personal recrimination, lose our tempers and thus waste our time. It seems there is a growing inconsistency between the public and private life of a Congress worker. The result is that goondaism, lack of discipline and carelessness are increasing day by day. As preparations are afoot for transferring the Government into our hands, our responsibility is also increasing. We must get rid of anger, intolerance, etc., otherwise we will not be able to stand on our own. Not only this, we might be caught up in a bigger bondage. I want a swaraj in which the millions of illiterates in our country will realize its benefits. You have to cultivate the strength to achieve that. The government [under swaraj] should be such that people  may clearly see the distinction between the arbitrary and autocratic British rule and the democratic government run on non-violent lines. I am an optimist. I maintain that once the reins of Government are transferred to us we will realize our responsibilities and all the artificial barriers existing at present will vanish.
 My faith in non-violence and truth is being strengthened all the more in spite of the increasing number of atom bombs. I have not a
 shadow of doubt that there is no power superior to the power of truth and non-violence in the world. See what a great difference there is between the two: one is moral and spiritual force, and is motivated by infinite soul-force; the other is a product of physical and artificial power, which is perishable. The soul is imperishable. This doctrine is not my invention; it is a doctrine enunciated in our  Vedas  and Shastras. When soul-force awakens, it becomes irresistible and conquers the world. This power is inherent in every human being. But one can succeed only if one tries to realize this ideal in each and every act in one’s life without being affected in the least by praise  or  censure.

 BAPU: Instead of being anxious to find out how many Muslims were killed by the Hindus, your primary duty is to find out how many Hindus the Muslims had killed and where and persuaded them not to commit such atrocities. Similarly you should go among the Hindus and serve them. You should assure them that all Muslims are not bad and thus remove their fear. If the nationalist Muslims of India did just this at the risk of their lives they would raise Muslims and Islam to greater heights and Khuda would shower His choicest blessings on them. But today who listens to me? If out of the four crore Muslims I could have only a hundred such brothers and sisters, they would be
 
 able to render great service to the forty crore Hindus and Muslims of India. Now, tell me, is any one of you prepared to take up  this mission?
 What our brethren are doing is, of course, wrong but we never support them.

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 
 April 17, 1947
 Explaining why he was late by 15 minutes Gandhiji said that he wanted the prayers to start 15 minutes later than scheduled because it was the time for namaz for the Muslims. He also said that even if the Muslims came in small numbers we must keep their namaz in mind.
We should respect all religions. In our prayer we also recite
 some portions from the Koran. I have heard that some boys ridicule the recitations from the Koran. We should not ridicule anybody’s religion. If we do so, other people will ridicule our religion, too, and that would lead to strife. I cannot give up reciting from the Koran in the course of my prayer. The whole prayer consists of recitations from several scriptures. Not a single item can be omitted from it even if it comes to discontinuing the whole prayer. Even if you do not participate in the prayer, you must listen to it carefully, and even if you do not understand it you should not ridicule it.
 After the prayer Gandhiji said:
 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 Some Muslims came to see me today and they gave me some painful new. They said that in PATNA city the Hindus have done considerable harm to the Muslims, and are still not repenting what they have done, and that they continue to threaten the Muslims. I had  a similar report about Bihar-Sharif. There too the Hindus bully and threaten the Muslims in the same way and the Muslims are afraid to return. It is our duty to rebuild the houses that have been destroyed. How can this be done when the Hindus harass even those who go there
 as labourers? What would the Muslims do? This is a very complicated question. I was surprised to hear this and felt ashamed. At one time the Hindus and the Muslims of Bihar used to live as brothers. But now they treat each other as enemies. I have received complaints from other places too. I could not go to Monghyr and Bihar-Sharif, but I hope to go to other places. I have grown weak and it would be more difficult on account of the heat. There was time when I did not bother about these things. But I have now grown old. You can spare me that trouble if you wish. If you can carry my voice up to Bihar-Sharif, tell the Hindus there that they should not go on troubling an old man like me. My work can become easier if you wish. Some Muslims have demanded rifle licences. Personally, I would not like anyone to have a rifle. A rifle may be used for hunting. But we have no danger of tigers here Today rifles are used by the Hindus and the Muslims to kill or intimidate each other. If proper arrangements are made, rifles and guns would not be needed at all. It is said in the Bible that we should look forward to an age when no swords would be needed and the material used for making them could be diverted to make other useful things. It is said in the Ramayana That when Rama was asked how he would fight against Ravana, Rama said that he would have the armour of purity and his noble endeavour would stand by him. In my view the Muslims should not even think that they can have protection against the assaults from the Hindus if they possessed rifles. The Hindus should tell them that so long as they are alive no harm will come to the Muslims. They must tell the Muslims that their sisters and daughters are as much their own sisters and daughters and they will protect them.
 Some big Hindu landlords came to see me today. Then some Muslim landlords also met me. I do not wish to convey to you everything they said to me. I shall speak about these things to the Ministers who can do something about them. Even so, I do wish to tell you a few things. I have come to know that the peasants and the workers have started thinking that they have become the rulers, and therefore they are free to abuse the landlords. They think that they can withhold the revenue and deprive the landlords of their due. This would do them no good. The peasants are harming their own interests. Even if they kill a few landlords, how is it going to help? The peasants and workers are too many and the landlords too few. What is the point of riding roughshod over the landlords and wanting to finish them off? It is said that the peasants are doing everything in the name of
 disobedience to law. But disobedience to law as taught by me does not involve ruining and annihilating others. I am leaving aside  the Muslims just now. We cannot win freedom in this way. We must be friendly to all. Granting that the landlords had been plundering the peasants till now, it does not mean that now that we have achieved power we should plunder the landlords. Will the peasants remove the landlords and occupy their positions? We should do everything in a proper manner. If we follow violent methods we shall only spread violence. And, when that happens you yourself would turn round and ask if that was what Ramarajya meant. You would say that you were comfortable during the British rule and have no peace now. I should like to tell all the peasants and workers that they should not create chaotic conditions. Let them not think that they are the sole masters of the country. They should not think that just because the railways belong to us they can pull the chain and bring the trains to a halt wherever they want, or that they can travel without tickets and rob others. This is not a proper thing to do; it is rowdyism by which we can achieve nothing. We therefore must do everything possible to stop such things. Let us go to those who indulge in such activities and persuade them to desist from such actions and explain to them that no one stands to gain by acting in this manner.

      DEAR 	FRIEND, Many 	thanks for your letter of the 9th instant.  April 	18, 1947 
  	I cannot endorse your insinuations. I have never subscribed to 	hush-hush policy. Publication of false news I hold to be a crime 	against humanity. If true news gives rise to conflagration there is 	something wrong with society and its leaders.libtech_692_footnote  	I began publishing the wires received from Noakhali when I despaired 	of getting a hearing from you and when living outside Noakhali I 	felt helpless. Probably my presence in Noakhali would have made no 	difference in the situation. Only I would have derived the 	satisfaction from the fact that I was in Noakhali sharing the trials 	of its people and my co-workers.  	It surprises me that you should discount the statements of facts 	supplied by Shri Satis Chandra Das Gupta. The culprits may never be 	traced but the facts of arson and loot could not be disputed, nor 	could the community from which the culprits are derived by disputed. 	The rulers whether democrats or autocrats—whether foreign or 	indigenous—forfeit the right to rule when they fail to deal 	properly with crimes even when the culprits are able to defy 	detection.

  TALK WITH MANU GANDHI libtech_703_footnote 
 
GANDHI CAMP PATNA ,
 April 18, 1947 I will have no regrets if the money invested in these machines is reduced to dust. True India lies in its seven lakh villages.  Do  you
 know that big cities like London have exploited India and the big cities of India in turn have exploited its villages? That is how palatial mansions have come up in big cities and villages have become impoverished. I want to infuse new life into these villages. I do not say that all the mills in cities should be demolished. But we should be vigilant and start afresh wherever we happen to make a mistake. We should stop exploiting the villages and should closely examine the injustice done to the villages and strengthen their economic structure.
 I have no doubt that we have gained much strength through truth and non-violence. The country would never have risen high had it not adopted the weapon of non-violence. But truth has not been followed by the people to the extent it ought to have been. I am often surprised to see so much untruth prevailing in the country. No doubt our practice of non-violence is far from perfect, but if we had not adopted it, we would not have progressed so much. Our goal is truth and truth can be reached only through the observance of non- violence. Non-violence is only a means. Speaking truth is a habit I have formed right from my childhood, but I had to make efforts to practise non-violence. If we adopt non-violence, truth can be followed along with it. Sometimes good comes out of evil, but that is divine dispensation. Human experience is that as good comes out of good, only evil comes out of evil. Retaliation cannot end violence. If humanity is to rise above violence there is no alternative but to adopt non-violence. Love alone can conquer hatred. The principles of truth and non-violence are nothing new; they have been in existence from the beginning of creation. After 60 years’ experience my faith in these ideals is growing stronger day by day.

 Zamindars or capitalists will not be able to survive if they continue to suppress peasants and labourers. Now you should behave towards them not as their masters but as partners and friends, and act as their trustees; then alone can you survive. For a long time during the British regime you have been exploiting the labourers and peasants. Therefore I advise you in your own interest that if you do not see the writing on the wall, it will be difficult for you to adjust.

 If labourers aim at asserting their rights, they can do so only by co-operating with zamindars, not by harassing or killing them. Abolition of zamindari is not a very difficult task. We have only a handful of zamindars here. But if you take the law into your own hands you will be striking at the root of your own interest. You can place your complaints before the Government but you cannot take the law into your hands and resort to violence. One who seeks to destroy others invites one’s own doom. There are numerous such instances. The best known is that of the Yadavaslibtech_704_footnotelibtech_705_footnote. If you work whole-heartedly during your working hours, your employers will have to pay you your proper wages. But if you harass them in any manner you will not earn anybody’s sympathy. I told the zamindars who were here a little while ago what I thought right and I tell you the same. It is my nature.  I cannot act otherwise. I must tell you what I think proper.

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 
 
 
 PATNA,
 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  April 	18, 1947 
  	Some landlords came to me yesterday and brought several complaints, 	one of which was that the peasants and labourers were out to ruin 	them. In this connection I said yesterday that this was a dangerous 	thing to do. By indulging in such acts they are only harming 	themselves. Abolition of zamindari is but a small matter. When the 	zamindars and the peasants develop cordial relations the former need 	not be eliminated. The landlords are like a drop in the ocean. It is 	no great problem to dispense with them. But this should not be done 	by force. The Mahabharata tells us that the Yadavas were 	themselves annihilated when they were out to destroy others. They 	took to drinking, and fighting among themselves  destroyed each 	other. Similarly, if the peasants and labourers will think of 	destroying others, they will themselves be ruined.  	A gentleman told me today that I was not fully aware of the 	situation. He said that the peasants and labourers did not try to 	force their way, still the landlords oppressed them. I told him that 	if the landlords and the capitalists still exploited the peasants 	and labourers, they were harming their own interests. They would 	never survive if they behaved like masters. They could if they 	agreed to act as trustees.  	If I am a millionaire, I should spend my wealth on those who help me 	in my accumulation of the millions. It is only when I do this that I 	can be called a trustee. But I cannot be called a trustee if I 	appropriate Rs. 1,000 and indulge in luxuries when I actually need 	only Rs. 5 or Rs. 50. I can also take money for the upkeep of my 	children as for my own. But I cannot give my children shares worth 5 	or 10 lakhs so that they own four or five cars and live in grand 	style. You should not find fault with me if I say that I cannot 	manage on Rs. 5, that I cannot take sattu libtech_706_footnoteand need fruit and milk in order to be able to work. 	You should let me have the money to meet my needs. But I should not 	take even a pice more than I need. I had demonstrated in Champaran 	how labourers could assert their rights. The  indigo planters 	virtually ruled the place. They had their separate colonies and  
 the poor were not supposed to cross their way. But I saw that their rule came to an end. People did not set fire to the houses of the planters to end their rule. Nor did they kill the planters. They only refused to work. Today also the proprietors must march with the times.
 Some visitors told me today that a punitive tax had  been  imposed on them. A punitive tax is one imposed by the Government on the people of an entire village or neighbourhood. Suppose we harbour three goondas in our village and they misbehave with and kill the Muslim women and children of the village, the Government cannot arrest us because we are respectable people. Even if we are arrested the courts will acquit us for want of evidence. The rowdies also cannot be arrested because we harbour them. And so, the Government imposes a collective fine on the whole village by way of punishment. If some of us confess the crime and undertake to pay the tax, then the Government would not impose the tax on the innocent. But we do not reveal the names of those guilty of arson and assaults.
 The visitors also complained that the persons responsible for the riots, who had attacked the Muslims and ruined them, were still at large and moving about freely. They said they could not return to their villages. I had said at Jahanabad that those who had caused the ruin and destruction should themselves help rebuild the houses they had destroyed. We should go to the Muslims and confess our guilt and ask for their forgiveness. We must reassure them that we would now protect them and act as their guards. We should ask them to return to their homes and should offer to meet their expenses. The people of the villages where the punitive tax has not been imposed should also inform the Government of their willingness to pay the tax. They should tell the Government that they would rebuild the houses of the Muslims and ask the Government to provide wood and bricks at the villagers’ cost. But the Government should not sell it at a profit. This will be Bihar’s atonement for the grave crime committed by it and it will thereby rise to great heights.
 The villages harbouring such culprits should confess  their crimes and seek forgiveness. For the Government can arrest a few criminals, but how can it apprehend a mob of thousands mounting an attack? If this is done the Muslims also would not clamour for retaliation against the Hindus. And if some miscreants create trouble, the other Muslims would stop them. Even the Muslim League supporters would stop them because Jinnah Saheb has expressed his
 view against the use of force in politics. Newspapermen should also refrain from inciting one community against the other. They can render great help in maintaining peace if they so desire.
 If we honestly admit our crimes we would be reducing the  burden on the Government. Just now the Government is overburdened. The present Government is a people’s government. If the Ministers are not leaders but servants, they must inspire such confidence among the Muslims that they would testify that they would never leave Bihar, that they had nothing to fear here and that they would continue to live here of their own will.
 There is a third point which, God willing, I shall talk about tomorrow.

  TALK WITH MUSLIM STUDENTS

 April 18, 1947
 I greatly value the magnificent role played by students in the fight for freedom. But today this enthusiasm has taken a different direction. If you make a firm resolve you can be of great help in my effort for Hindu-Muslim unity. Befriend the Hindu students. Treat their sisters as your own sisters. If they are in difficulty, go and share their misfortune and build your character. You are the architects of the future India. It was from amongst people like you that prophets like Mohammed Saheb came. Why need I go further? There are living examples right in front of your eyes, aren’t there? The non-violent and truthabiding workers like the Maulanalibtech_707_footnotelibtech_708_footnoteand Khan Saheblibtech_709_footnotelibtech_710_footnoteare from amongst you. Now they have grown old. You have therefore to develop the strength to shoulder the responsibility of running the government when it is transferred to you. And to acquire this strength you should have strength of character.

    DEAR 	DR. JONES,  April 	19, 1947 
  	I got your letter this morning and am so glad to learn that you were 	able to visit Sabarmati and renew your recollections. I remember 	well how you missed a looking glass in the room that was alloted to 	you, and how philosophically you took the absence of the article 	considered so useful in the West.  	When the British troops, that powerful emblem of British rule, is 	removed from India that very fact will be a triumph, besides which 	every other pageant that can be conceived, must fade into 	insignificance.  	I have no notion when I shall be able to leave my present haunt. I 	fully appreciate your prayerful sympathy in the task before me.  	Please pass on my love to Mrs. Stanley Jones whenever you write to 	her. I don’t know whether she is in India at present or whether 	she is in U.S.A. Please tell her that I remember the promise I 	hastily and lightly made to her that I will, when I got the 	necessary leisure, write out a dialogue for the use of children in 	the many schools she was conducting. I never got the leisure. But 	what is more true is that the task was much more difficult than I 	had imagined and to this day I do not know how I could deal with the 	delicate subject of the evil    
 habits of children.

Desai     TALK WITH WORKERSlibtech_713_footnote   GANDHI 	CAMP PATNA ,  April 	19, 1947  	We cannot fully enjoy the freedom of our country unless we bring 	about a fundamental change in our  education  system. Education 	should be imparted through the means of crafts. Today we pass  our  	examinations  studying  the   text-books  prescribed   for  us.   
 Instead of wasting time over those worthless books we should carry out experiments. For example, we should study how to grow cotton and make experiments in all the processes, right from cotton-growing to weaving of cloth. And then we can find out the names of the different varieties of cotton grown in various countries and also show their samples to children. Knowledge of history,  geography, arithmetic and language can easily be imparted through this craft. And thus we can get rid of the lethargy that has overtaken us and can become industrious. If this craft is made compulsory in a large number of schools, we can easily achieve our object. University education does not serve much purpose. On the contrary it is harmful because an educated young man then can think of nothing except taking up a job. There are quite a few such young men who, to my knowledge, are totally ignorant in spite of their education and are unable to earn a single pice. On the other hand an illiterate artisan is quite capable of earning at least Rs. 6070 a month. These college- educated young men without jobs are driven from pillar to post. They do require, nonetheless, a minimum standard of clothing, shoes, etc., to suit their education. Thus parents first spend money on their education and then spend as much again to keep up their ‘position’ even during their unemployment. Our students today are in such a state of bankruptcy—and as a result the plight of the people is equally miserable. In order to improve the lot of our people, therefore, it is essential to launch a campaign for education through crafts. But such changes cannot be brought about merely by making speeches or issuing official circulars. No doubt they will help to some extent. But if the leaders, i.e., those in power, were to devote regularly an hour or so daily to some craft, it would have a tremendous impact. How was it that a handful of Englishmen could keep us in bondage for so many years? One of the reasons was that they introduced a system of education that could produce only clerks.

 The foreign power will be withdrawn before long, but for me real freedom will come only when we free ourselves of the domination

  TALK WITH BIHAR MINISTERS 
 April 19, 1947
  Ministers 	and Governors 	should, as far 	as possible, use  	articles manufactured in 	India, have khadi alone 	to wear for 	themselves and 	their family members and 	keep the wheel of 	non- violence 	going and help the 	crores of poor earn their 	bread.  They 	should learn both 	the Nagari 	and Persian 	 scripts,  abjure use 	of English 	among themselves and 	use Hindustani for 	all public 	occasions. They 	should also encourage 	the use of 	provincial languages. 	Hindustani should 	be their 	medium for 	 all  official 	purposes and all their 	office orders and 	circulars should be 	issued in 	it so 	that the enthusiasm to 	learn Hindustani 	grows and 	it may 	automatically become the 	lingua franca of India.  They 	should be completely 	free from the 	taint of untouchability, 	casteism, and nepotism. 	Those holding high 	positions should 	be impartial 	towards all, whether the 	person be 	his own brother, son or an ordinary citizen, be he an artisan or a labourer.  Their 	personal lives 	should be models 	of simplicity. 	They should perform 	body-labour for 	at least 	an hour 	daily either in 	the form 	of spinning 	or growing 	food or 	vegetables to 	help the country 	to make 	good the food shortage.  They 	should not live 	in bungalows or 	have cars. They should 	live in simple 	houses. They might make use 	of a motor-car 	but sparingly, 	only for special 	reasons, such as 	going long 	distances. Although 	the need 	for a 	motor-car will 	always be there 	it should 	be used 	as sparingly 	as possible.  By 	living in 	one place 	or close 	to one 	another, Ministers, 	their families 	and their 	staff would come into closer touch with one 	another. This would 	ensure better co-ordination among them.  They 	and their 	family members should, as 	far as 	possible, avoid the use of servants and do their own domestic chores.  The 	use of 	costly foreign 	furniture, sofa 	 sets,  almirahs, glossy 	chairs, etc., should 	be avoided, particularly 	in view 	of the 	prevailing conditions 	when, let alone 	carpets, crores of 	people do 	not have 	enough to cover themselves. The 	Ministers should be 	free from all 	vices and addictions. 
 If they set an example in plain living and high thinking, they would need no bodyguards. I am sure people themselves  would provide all the security they might require instead of their having to take security measures in the form of half a dozen policemen. Ministers wedded to non-violence ought to feel embarrassed by such arrangements. This would mean a lot of saving.
 But who will heed my advice? Nevertheless I cannot remain silent as I do not want to be an unprotesting witness to what is taking place around me in the country today. It is up to the Bihar of Dr. Rajendra Prasad to set an example in this regard.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        PATNA, 
  April 	19, 1947  	I intended to talk to you about two letters that I have received. 	One of the letters is written by a Bihari gentleman. He has 	mentioned his name but not his address. He writes: “There is no 	doubt about your being a great man. Everyone calls you Mahatma. And 	you are a god because people worship you. Who would challenge you in 	politics?” Poor Chanakya’slibtech_715_footnotespirit must be  running  from  place  to place in 	fear ! Then he suggests that I should retire to the Himalayas. He 	asks me, “What is the crime of the Biharis?” Again, if the 	Hindus of Bihar have oppressed the Muslims, why don’t I look at 	the Punjab where the Muslims are perpetrating so much tyranny? He 	says I am turning the Hindus into cowards. The other letter is from 	a woman from the Punjab, well known to me from her very young days. 	She tells me that she had till now believed in my creed of 	non-violence but  
 believes in it no longer. Her letter expresses her anguish. Then she goes on to say that we need brave men today. Both these persons have written with great consideration. Of course they are both angry. The second chapter of the Gita says: “Wrath breeds stupefaction, stupefaction leads to loss of memory, loss of memory ruins reason and ruin of reason spells utter destruction.”libtech_716_footnote
 Those who are possessed by anger would find even my plain words harsh. It is said that women’s honour can be protected if their menfolk are brave and always keep their swords drawn. But let me tell you this is not true. Even if there are millions of brave men around, strife persists in the world. Even if India’s 400 million men turn brave nothing can be expected to happen, unless the women themselves become brave. When the women become brave no one will dare raise his eyes to them. You have seen how the people of  Champaran suffered hardships for a century because of the custom of tinkathia. The indigo planters who ruled the province were not concerned about them at all. But when the peasants and labourers fought non-violently against their rule of terror, in six months their rule came to an end. The people of Bihar do not have to go far. They can learn a lot from Champaran.
 Now, I too have signed the peace appeal along with Jinnah Saheb. God alone knows what the result will be. What I am doing in Bihar today is something which cannot be postponed or dismissed. I am serving Bihar more this time than I did during the Champaran days. I appeal to you to give up this madness and make genuine atonement which will help Bihar raise the reputation of the whole country and set an example to the world.
 The meetings of the Charkha Sangh and the Talimi Sangh will be held from today and will continue for the next four or five days. Today was the first meeting of the Charkha Sangh. I want to tell you something about khadi. The late Jamnalal Bajaj had started the khadi work while I was still in prison. He had also set up the Khadi Board. In the early days khadi was given primary importance in the Congress. But later the parliamentary programme was given priority and the constructive programme secondary importance. Khadi was made the centre of the constructive programme. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru called
 
 
 khadi “the livery of freedom”libtech_717_footnotelibtech_718_footnote. Our flag also carries the emblem of the charkha. From the time the Congress evolved its flag I had been saying that we would win swaraj with the help of the charkha. Today it appears that the British rule over India would end more or less within the next twelve months. The British soldiers will also leave  the  country. The British could stay on in free India but as our friends, as servants of India. Whether people accept it or not, khadi has contributed greatly towards our free-dom. Had all the people truly believed in khadi, every Indian would have been wearing khadi today, and there would not have been a single textile mill in the country. Khadi found a place in the Congress, but we did not give it the place in our hearts we ought to have. Today the khadi work is progressing very well and because of khadi several crores of rupees have gone to poor men and women.
 You must understand the place of khadi very well. Khadi is widely used in Bihar. But if everyone had known the real significance of khadi we would not have witnessed the madness that prevailed here. People in the Punjab, Bengal, Bombay and Ahmedabad had fallen victims to a similar madness. They are in the grip of such madness even today. The hearts of those who wear khadi should be as spotless as the khadi they wear. Had people sincerely adopted khadi they would not have let themselves be swept away by such frenzy. Khadi shows to what extent we are non-violent at heart, although God alone knows what we are truly at heart. But we ourselves cannot know our own hearts. He who does is the wise one. There is a saying in English that he who knows himself knows all. This means that we do not know ourselves.
 Khadi is a symbol of non-violence. Hence, right from the time khadi came into vogue I have been saying that khadi ought to spread to the seven lakhs of villages of India. Once I was asked if khadi, being a sacred thing, could be used by prostitutes. I said it could be. Khadi is for wearing as food is for eating, whether by the pure or the impure.
 Those who wear khadi should never commit an impure act. You might say that there would be barely half a dozen such individuals in the country. That is why I say that everyone should wear  khadi.  Today people wearing khadi caps are respected. They make their way
 into the assemblies and the Congress. Some people  even  deceive others by wearing khadi. I have heard that in Bihar people wearing khadi have even committed murders. Today we do not give khadi the respect due to it. That is why such things have been happening.
 Khadi is a symbol of non-violence. Man makes God in his own image. Good makes man, no doubt; but man also makes God. They God of the murderers prompts them to commit murders. We have made great efforts to make khadi the symbol of non-violence. In spite of my being a member of the Charkha Sangh, I must admit that even though much work has been done to propagate khadi, much more remains to be done.

Please look up what is known as Macdonald Awardlibtech_720_footnotelibtech_721_footnoteat 	the Round Table Conference which was born of a wicked conspiracy 	against Indian nationalism.

It was against this vivisection of 	Hindu society that I had prophesied revolt.libtech_722_footnotelibtech_723_footnoteAs 	a result reservation of seats was very considerably increased and 	primary elections were separated but the total separation was 	undone. In my opinion this was the utmost that could be conceded to 	the separatist tendency and the attempt to break up Hinduism. The 	opposition and the influence of caste Hindus in joint electorates is 	in my opinion nonsensical. Joint electorate means the influence of 	the party with which the electorate becomes joined. Such evil as 	there is in joint electorate can be obviated only by right type of 	education and    
 enlightenment. If Dr. Ambedkar’s objections were upheld for any length of time, be it ever so little, it would undermine Hinduism. The fear of boycott, therefore, should produce no consternation.

   TALK WITH WORKERSlibtech_725_footnote  
 GANDHI CAMP PATNA ,
 April 20, 1947
 I give more importance to cultural education than to knowledge of the three R’s. Good cultural background should be evident from the minutest detail of children’s daily behaviour—from the way they sit, talk and dress, and so on.
 I go a step further. In a poor country not a single pie should be spent unnecessarily, otherwise no distinction would be felt between our Government and the British  Government.libtech_726_footnotelibtech_727_footnoteEven  a  foreign  pin should not be used in our offices. If we need pins we should use Indian pins, or else do without them, i.e., we should stitch papers together with needle and thread. This is only by way of an illustration. I go even to the extent of saying that Ministers and Governors should take a vow along with their oath of allegiance that they will insist on only swadeshi goods being used for their personal and office requirements.
 But who listens to me today? Maybe I am growing old and perhaps even senile. (Bapu laughed heartily.)
 If I were the Chief Minister of Bihar, my first act would be to make the wearing of khadi compulsory for all Government servants and the people at large, not by purchasing it from the khadi shops but by making it a rule that no ration-card holder would be entitled to
 A.I.V.I.A. products by the various Ministries.
 draw his ration unless he span for half an hour daily.
 It was clear to him, he said, that if they all learnt to spin and to weave, India could not only become self-sufficient in the matter of cloth without dependence upon mills but could even clothe the world. It was simple arithmetic. And if knowing all that, they could not get even that much done, what were the Ministers good for and what was their statecraft worth? He was afraid, they had developed the habit of making simple things which admitted of very simple solutions unnecessarily difficult and complicated. What they needed was not costly and elaborate machinery or highly paid technicians and experts, but plain common sense, combined with the will to go down to the masses, share their lives, think in their terms and win their confidence. They should teach them by personal example how they could in the immediate present provide themselves with what they so sorely needed but had hitherto lacked. The masses would instinctively feel that the era of the common man had arrived.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        PATNA, 
  April 	20, 1947   BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	Today again I shall talk to you about khadi. The second meeting of 	the Charkha Sangh was held today. Had I been your Chief Minister 	like Shri Babu and had I been in a position to have ministers of my 	choice I would have told you plainly that you would get no 	mill-cloth. I would have given you all facilities for the purpose. I 	would have provided you cotton, spinning-wheels and all the other 	things. I would have also arranged for the repair of the spinning- 	wheels when they went wrong. And I would have told you that you had 	to make your own clothing as also your own slivers and weave the 	cloth as the Assamese women do. Assamese girls cannot find grooms 	unless they learn weaving. But the weaving in Assam is very poor. 	Assam grows a lot of cotton but it is not of good quality. However, 	things are improving now. The Trustees of the Charkha Sangh are very 	efficient and they are now introducing changes to improve the 	weaving. If our country can make good progress in  weaving,  we 	would be able to clothe the whole world because ours is a vast 
 country. In the past we used to import Japanese textiles in large quantities. But now Japan is almost out of picture. Even Great Britain does not produce enough cloth to meet the requirement of the whole world. Just as we arrange to cook our own food at home we should also do the same to meet our requirement of clothes. At one time it used to be so in our country. It was so during the medieval period. We often call it the dark age, but I do not agree. No doubt there were some disgraceful practices prevalent then. But we cannot describe the present age, either, as the age of truth. Today the black market thrives throughout the world. We should not close our eyes to the remarkable features of that age by calling it a dark age. Let us forget its bad points and follow the good ones. Even today, if we start substituting homemade roti by the biscuits manufactured in Britain or in India, we are going to ruin our health. As in the case of food, we should stop getting our clothing too from outside. Had I been in Shri Babu’s place, I would put a stop to black markets. No accounts are kept for the roti cooked in the house. The flour is made in the house and so also the roti. In the same manner, we would provide a charkha to everybody and there would be cloth for everybody. But no one is going to make me a minister! I have tto address my words to those who are already occupying the ministerial chairs. I would tell them that no new textile mill should be set up in Bihar. The existing mills should not be burnt down, but all the cloth produced by them should be exported. In this way people all over the world would be happy and would praise us for sending to them finished textile goods while opting for handwoven material for ourselves. Thus we should earn as much foreign exchange as possible. But if we let black-marketing flourish even in this trade the result would be bad. Even now if the people resolve to manage with a few clothes only and cut down their requirement, something can be achieved. Today Bihar has been left completely free. It means now the work has been decentralized. The work of the Charkha Sangh in Bihar is now being looked after by Lakshmi Babu and his colleagues who have been entrusted with the entire Charkha Sangh work in the province. They may produce as much cloth as they like. They may work with the help of Shri Babu and his colleagues so that khadi is produced in the villages and consumed locally.
You might ask what the people of Patna would have for
 themselves. But the villagers can provide khadi for the citizens of Patna too. But even if they do not you can produce your own khadi if you wish. There are many schools and colleges here where boys and girls go to study. The boys go to study the English language but hardly achieve anything worth while. They may obtain the M.A. or
 B.A. degrees, but most of them cannot write English. They just  manage to speak a little English, and consider themselves great. If all the students learn spinning and weaving for an hour or two daily they would be doing all the work themselves in a few days. If even those who are not studying give an hour or two to khadi work while sitting idle at home they can produce more khadi than they would need. Khadi does not need coercion. If you do this work voluntarily, you can produce khadi of every kind. The village people have been exploited enough. The townspeople consume the cloth produced by them. But I wish villagers to consume the cloth they produce.  It  should be so even for the townspeople.
 Everything that goes with the mills comes from outside;  so  much so that even the spindle of the mill’s spinning-wheel is not produced here. The textile engineers also come from outside. But all the components of the charkha can be produced here. If khadi is woven in the villages, every village can become selfsufficient and meet its own requirements of food and clothing.
 Bihar is now free from [the supervision of] the Charkha Sangh. Lakshmi Babu will demonstrate how decentralization works. If he fails I shall ask him if the people of Bihar are capable only of plunder and massacre and can do nothin5g good.

  LETTER TO SARALADEVI A. SARABHAI 
 April 21, 1947
 The day before yesterday the Board of Trustees discussed your name. They were nearly unanimous that at a time when khadi was under a cloud and when the khadi policy was obviously operating against the mills, the inclusion of the wife of a textile king on the Board was sure to cause an uproar. In spite of it the Board of Trustees might have agreed to your appointment if I had insisted on it. I refused to ask for a favour in this manner. The Trustees were happy. I therefore withdrew your name. But my calculation in this case went slightly awry. I have often of late noticed that my word does not carry weight with my co-workers and colleagues as it once used to do. In a way it pleases me. Maybe, I was stifling their reason before and it has now found its freedom! Or, is my thinking out of tune with the times? Be that as it may, I have fully opened my mind to you. Such is my regard for your purity. What I expect of you is that you will continue to take interest in developing the science of khadi as if you were actually a  trustee of the Spinners’ Association and belie the  doubts
 
 and fears of the sceptics by showing to them that the wife of a mill- owner can be as much a lover of khadi as the most ardent of khadi workers.

Its secret lies in 	hand-spun yarn. Spinning used to be the occupation of women who were 	regarded as slaves. Who would pay the poor souls the wage that was 	their due? In the middle ages women were compelled to spin for a 	mere pittance. Except in Assam, weaving everywhere was considered to 	be man’s occupation. Weaving has survived even today, but if 	hand-spinning is not revived weaving too is certain to die  out  in 	course of time.  	If every man and woman does not regard spinning as his or her 	dharma, that is, does not do carding , or make slivers and spin 	himself or herself, khadi is bound to die. I shall not call it khadi 	if a few wear it by way of fashion. My definition of khadi is that 	it should replace mill-cloth throughout India. I do not have the 	words to describe the strength it is bound to generate.  	This will remain but a dream if men do not spin by way of atonement 	and the injustice done to women does not cease. The wages payable to 	women for an hour’s spinning should be the same as are paid to 	men. There should be no inequality in the wages paid to men and 	women. The times have changed when man was regarded as   
 woman’s master. That we do not admit this is a different matter. God has made man and woman one complete whole. One must not lord over the other. An endeavour is being made to establish this truth through khadi.
 Time will come when a mill-owner’s wife will herself become a worker and a carding woman. Then there will be no need for mill- cloth. Women should prepare themselves to hasten the advent of such a day.

Courtesy: Seth Govind Das     DISCUSSION AT HINDUSTANI TALIMI SANGH 		MEETING   PATNA,  April 	22, 1947  ZAKIR 	HUSAINlibtech_747_footnote: 	In the morning session we heard the reports from the provinces. The 	budget was sanctioned and the question of how much aid we should 	seek from the Government was discussed.  GANDHIJI: The Government 	would be prepared to give us  as much as we ask for. But the very 	move to seek Government aid would mean the end of Nayee Talim.  ZAKIR 	HUSAIN: No, the question 	was only regarding the students’ fees. The point under discussion 	was how many students should we admit. If we take more students it 	will naturally help us in meeting the expenses but then we would be 	ruining our cause.  GANDHIJI: Of course, that 	is obvious. We should take only as many students as we want—not 	more. I have quite a few things to say about the budget. I would 	like Ashadevi and Aryanayakum to sit and discuss it with me and make 	whatever alterations they possibly can in it. After three years 	nothing should be expected either from me or  
 from anyone else. If we fail to achieve this, Nayee Talim will not work. If you want to make it self-supporting you should prepare you budget accordingly. And if at the end of three years we do  not  succeed we will have to declare our bankruptcy before the country. We should not keep silent lest we lose the credit we have earned. True credit lies in success.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: We have received a request from Madraslibtech_748_footnotethat the Talimi Sangh should run a school there. The Government is prepared to bear its expenses. They have asked for Ramachandran to take up the responsibility of conducting Nayee Talim under the Ministry.
 GANDHIJI: Ramachandran hasn’t come, has he? I shall have to talk with him about this. As regards the school we should take up the task only if we are capable of fulfilling it, other- wise we shall be putting the Government in a fix. Today we have our ministries and crores of rupees have come into our hands. We can spend the amount any way we like. If our own conscience does not question it, perhaps no one else would. This can work for a year or two. But in the absence of any concrete achievement it is not going to last long. I would, therefore, advise you to accept this responsibility only if you feel you are competent enough to shoulder, it. If we are not, we ought to admit that we can teach [ Nayee Talim] only at our centre and that the provinces are beyond our reach. Instructors from Madras are welcome to come and have a look at the work going on at Sevagram.
 Our system of education has three aspects. It leads to the development of the mind, the body and the soul. The ordinary system cares only for the development of the mind. Our system, I claim, purifies the mind and is conducive to its harmonious development. Moreover, it provides nourishment to the soul as well. What does it matter if we do not impart religious instruction? Religious teaching— that again from books—is not indispensable for the soul. Through practice we shall teach the boys the noble principles from all the religions.
 Nayee Talim is not confined to teaching spinning and sweeping. Though indispensable, these in themselves are not sufficient for our purpose. We shall have to give them up unless they promote the development of the soul. Here I am engaged in other tasks. But Nayee Talim has never been out of my mind.
 The charkha occupied an important place much before Nayee Talim was even conceived of. I knew almost nothing  about  the charkha when I first referred to it in South Africa in 1908. It was only later on that I learnt more about it. Afterwards came the days of civil disobedience and the Ali Brothers, and the charkha continued to hold an important place. Yesterday in my prayer meetinglibtech_749_footnotelibtech_750_footnoteI  had  drawn before you the picture of khadi as I visualize it. Khadi of my conception is that which can take the place of all mill-cloth. I would not insist on including khadi in Nayee Talim, if you could suggest some other means for the eradication of poverty. In that case I would gladly admit my mistake. I had discussed this point with Vinoba, Krishnadaslibtech_751_footnotelibtech_752_footnoteand Narandas. To me it is a simple calculation. I feel that if everyone spins for an hour daily all would be able to have the cloth required. If, however, it would require six hours a  day  from everybody to achieve this, khadi was bound to perish. For people have to do other work also. They have to produce food and do some intellectual work as well. Moreover, Nayee Talim would lose its meaning if one was ever to toil like a bullock under it. An hour spent in spinning is an hour of self-development for the spinner. When Saiyidain   Saheblibtech_753_footnotelibtech_754_footnotesaid   that   at   least   in   the   post-basic   stage   the mechanical processes in the mills would have to be taught, I could not accept it. I hold that if khadi is sound as a foundation for basic education, it ought to be further developed during  the  post-basic stage. Yesterday Dev Prakash showed me an article which he had written on the takli and the broom. He has done some work under Nayee Talim. If all that he writes is true, a lot of knowledge— including the knowledge of higher engineering—can be gained through Nayee Talim. But only when we have assimilated all this knowledge can we impart it to others. We have not evolved the science of these essential crafts. The British cloth mills evolved out of our takli and loom. They planned the mills because they wanted to exploit us. We do not want to exploit anyone. We do not, therefore, need mills, but we must build up the science of the takli and the loom. If India were to copy Europe in this matter, it would mean destruction for India and the world. Of course, if you are in favour of mills then let us talk about them.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: [The difficulty is that] the boys who graduate from our
 
 schools look to the mills for employment.
 GANDHIJI: The boys that will come out of the school of my conception will not look to the mills for employment. As a matter of fact mill-cloth should not sell side by side with khadi. Our mills may export their manufactures. In Lancashire you do not get the cloth manufactured there. The whole of it is exported. But perhaps our mills may not be able to sell their product for long even in foreign markets.
 You are right when you say that you cannot help it if the whole atmosphere around is surcharged with the idea of mill-cloth, and even our own ministers are interested in opening mills. The way for us is to die in living up to our faith. If we believe in the truth of khadi we must spread it and convince the ministers that we are doing the right thing and will continue to do so. We are not going to accept defeat. The Congress created the Talimi Sangh but never took any interest in it. Similarly the Congress was instrumental in setting up the Charkha Sangh but it never adopted its programme. Who cares for these institutions today? When Congressmen had a little money and some experience they paid some attention to the constructive work. No doubt, they did some constructive work too. Today,  however,  the entire Government has come into their hands. They have not yet digested the power it has brought. They will take time to do so.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: We are faced with a great difficulty. To run a school under Nayee Talim means bringing about a new order. Moreover, all the power is in the hands of the ministers who do not fully share our views.
GANDHIJI: No doubt about it. After all schools in the cities
cannot be created out of nothing.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: Either you help to co-ordinate the activities  of  the Government and the Sangh or let us be on our own.
GANDHIJI: I confess I no longer command the same influence as
 I used to . I do not blame the Government for this. They have  inherited a set machinery which they have to work. If I had been a minister, perhaps, I too would have acted similarly. Still, I am talking things over with Jawaharlalji and others. I have to talk and convince them about the work of the Talimi Sangh, have’nt I? I pray to God either to call me to Himself or endow my words with such power that they are able to carry conviction to the people  and  their representatives.
 You should give up Nayee Talim if you do not believe that it is full of potentialities. Some people come to tell me that now my work is over. So far ahimsa was followed but now the time has come for me to leave. They are not going to listen to me any more.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: But Bapuji, the Congress ought to have explained its policy regarding the Talimi Sangh to the ministers. It never did. I met Maulana Saheb before coming here. He had expressed sympathy and said that he would like to meet the Sangh. The Sangh has now decided to see him.
GANDHIJI: They should have invited you before this. Let Mr.
 Sargeantlibtech_755_footnotework but he should work under your guidance. In fact I have advised them to invite Zakir Husain Saheb and suggested that only after discussing things with him should they plan their work.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: We feel that with a little effort it could have been done but we never did make that effort.
GANDHIJI: Today the whole machinery of the Congress is
crumbling into pieces. Everyone does not realize it but I do.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: In my view facilities should be provided and time apportioned for religious education in our schools, so as to enable those well versed in religion to come and teach there. If the Government decides to undertake more than this it would only increase misunderstanding and friction. Supposing Maulana Saheb prepares the curriculum, not everyone will be prepared to accept it.
GANDHIJI: You should talk it over with Maulana Saheb. I do not
 subscribe to the view that the Government should provide religious education. If there are some Mussalmans who want to give religious education of the wrong type, you cannot prevent it. If you try to do so, the result can only be bad. Those who want to give religious education, without expecting any remuneration for it, may do so on their own. We will only teach ethics based on the fundamental principles of all religions.
 ARYANAYAKUM: One more question remains to be discussed. We have to grant certificates to the boys who have just completed their seven years’ course. What should we state in the certificate and what name should we give it?
GANDHIJI:   Please prepare a  draft in Hindustani and have  it  in
 both the scripts so that it is understood by all. Clearly state the boy’s qualifications  in   it.  Supposing  we  mention  that   our   boy   is more
 
 qualified than a matriculate, we have to be specific about it. The name should correspond with the qualification certified therein. Giving a thing a high-sounding name when its worth does not correspond to it reflects no credit on the giver.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: We may certify that the boy has completed a full course of basic education.
GANDHIJI: I would rather have a precise word for it just as the
 Hindi [Sahitya] Sammelan has precise names for its  different diplomas.
 AVINASHILINGAM: Though the Talimi Sangh follows the policy of co- education, we in the South do not want to introduce it there.
GANDHIJI: In that case you have the option to say that as it will
 not be convenient for you to adopt Nayee Talim fully in Madras you will be implementing it only partially. If you have co-education in your schools, but not in your training schools, the children will think there is something wrong somewhere.
 AVINASHILINGAM: I think there is no harm if we have co-education among the grown-ups, when they know their own minds. But, in my view, it is not proper for girls of 15 or 16 when they join our training camps.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: The Sangh has not made co-education obligatory for the training schools.
GANDHIJI: Your (Avinashilingam’s) arguments, I am afraid, fail
 to convince me. Even if my children have a tendency to go astray, I would let them run the risk. We shall have to rid ourselves one day of this sex mentality. We should not seek examples from the West. Even in the training schools if the teachers are competent, pure and filled with the spirit of Nayee Talim there is no danger. If, unfortunately, some accidents do take place, we should not be frightened. They are bound to be.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: We are not familiar with the conditions prevailing in Madras. If you feel that the atmosphere there is not favourable for co-education you should wait till it changes in its favour. For the time being you can send your girls to Sevagram.
 AVINASHILINGAM: Another difficulty facing us is that we do not have the requisite literature for Nayee Talim. If we can have it ready at one place, it can be adjusted according to the needs of the different provinces. The Talimi Sangh should
 take up this task. It can get the blocks made at cheaper rates, have the pictures printed and do such other jobs.
 ARYANAYAKUM: There were ten such persons, among those who attended our last training camp, who were competent to produce the literature. Two of them are in Madras. Let us have them for this job.
 AVINASHILINGAM: With your permission I would suggest that these books should have beautiful get up.
GANDHIJI: Basic education does not imply work of inferior
quality.
 AVINASHILINGAM: The books should have such a get up that they attract the children by their very appearance.

  TALK WITH BIHAR MINISTERS 
 GANDHI CAMP, PATNA,
 April 22, 1947
 I am seriously considering what is my dharma in the present circumstances. Nevertheless, it is my firm belief that God will show me the way through it all. What I say regarding non-violence has no impact today. I do appreciate the love people shower on me. But the only way for me to return that love is that I should place before the world the truth as revealed to me by God. We adopted the weapon of non-violence to drive away the powerful British Government from India. Now if we resort to violence against our own brethren we will be regarded as cowards and will be condemned by the world. You are wearing crowns of thorns on your heads, not of diamonds and pearls.

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 
 April 22, 1947
 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 Till yesterday I talked to you about khadi because the meetings of the Charkha Sangh were being held all this time. Today there was a
 
 meeting of the body formed for Nayee Talim, viz., the Hindustani Talimi Sangh. I wish to tell you about Nayee Talim today. Through you it would be known to the people of Bihar and  then  the information would spread throughout India. Nayee Talim is  now seven years old. There is Congress rule in many provinces. In some provinceslibtech_756_footnotethe   Muslim   League   is  in   power.   But   actually,   in   all provinces, it is the people who rule.
 The Congress introduced the Nayee Talim. Actually the Nayee Talim scheme was prepared some time earlier, but the Congress put its own stamp on it. Let us assume that where the Congress is in power the scheme of Nayee Talim would be carried out by its own workers. We shall carry it out since we have decided to do so. Even if the Congress does not adopt it, those who have accepted Nayee Talim would carry it out. Others would follow if they are convinced.
 Now if everyone in Bihar understands how Nayee Talim works, no other scheme can be implemented. If we teach khadi work to all the boys and girls according to the Nayee Talim scheme we shall be able to produce khadi without difficulty. And then Nayee Talim includes many other things as well. People say that the Congress does not carry out all those things. The Charkha Sangh and the Hindustani Talimi Sangh are the Congress organizations; then, why does the Congress not carry out those things? For the present I do not wish to go into this controversy. During the day today the Nayee Talim workers held a meeting. Dr. Zakir Husain was also present. Zakir Saheb is all in all at the Jamia Millia.libtech_757_footnotelibtech_758_footnoteHe has also received training abroad. Without his whole-hearted devotion the Jamia Millia could not be run as it is run now. The Jamia Millia came into being during the Non-co-operation days, when we had called upon boys and girls to come out of their schools and colleges. During those days the trustees of the Aligarh Muslim University said that the students were free to leave the University if they wished. A large number of Muslim students then gave up studies. Then came the problem of their future. It was then that the Jamia Millia was born. I also played some part in it. The Ali Brothers were then with us. Zakir Saheb was not there. But people had their eyes on him. When he came he took upon himself the responsibility and developed Jamia Millia into a great institution.
 Aryanayakum and Asha Devi of the Hindustani Talimi Sangh have also come here. Nayee Talim includes a great many things. I
 shall not talk about all of them. Nayee Talim means training our boys and girls through the medium of such handicrafts as are to be found in India and thus contributing to their growth and development. There should be harmonious development of the body, mind and soul. If everyone is given this type of training, there would be no fighting among ourselves such as is going on in the country today. Countries like England, Germany, Japan, Italy, etc., rely on the sword. Hence training of their children also follows the same pattern. You would be convinced if I explained all the points to you. These countries train their people in the light of the course they want them to follow. Under such training there is almost no scope for spiritual development. It emphasizes only physical development and the people with such training are appointed to high posts in the army and the government departments.
 We have followed the opposite course here. We followed the path of non-co-operation and achieved our aim through non-violence and truth. This in itself was Nayee Talim. When I called upon students to come out of their educational institutions I hardly had an idea about what was to be done with them. When we attained power, which was hardly of any use, I thought about our course of action and then we hit upon Nayee Talim and it came into being.libtech_759_footnoteThe most wonderful thing about Nayee Talim is that under this scheme the students have to spend nothing on their training. Another remarkable thing is that it is self-supporting, i.e., it does not need funds from outside to run it. I shall elaborate on this point tomorrow. Only if everyone understands the importance of Nayee Talim, it can become true training. It does not need investment of crores of rupees. It is said that we would require crores of rupees if we try to train everyone in the country. But, in my view, it is futile to talk in terms of millions and billions of rupees. That is not the way to go about training 400 million people. From where are we going to get so much money? Nayee Talim has so many possibilities that it costs nothing [to carry it on]. These days education costs a lot, but true Nayee Talim is one which would be self- supporting.

            DEAR 	DAUGHTER,   LETTER TO AMTUSSALAAM       PATNA,  April 	23, 1947 
  	I have your two letters. What you say is not right. I can say what I 	had said in Delhi laying stress on what was reported from Kanti and 	Devdas. I never bestow undeserved praise still. I will say nothing 	about you, if you cannot stand what I say.libtech_760_footnote  	Your stomach must return to normal. It is imperative to boil the 	water. Utensils should be cleaned with boiling water.  	Abha should consider it a sin to remain in ignorance. How long will 	she stay with you?  	As desired by you, I tore up your letter of yesterday. Your second 	letter is good.  	If the Muslims have cleansed their hearts and the Hindus have 	regained confidence as you say, there can be no cause for worry. But 	then what about the reports from Satis Babu? Did you have a talk 	with Satis Babu? Sita 	and Sumilibtech_761_footnotelibtech_762_footnoteare here. Today Sita is going to Akola.  Blessings 	from  BAPU   From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.

 unison. If you are true representatives of the League you should frankly tell Jinnah Saheb or Liaquat Ali Saheb that they are going in the wrong direction; only then you would be serving the League faithfully. Noakhali, Bengal and the Punjab are still witnessing massacres by Muslims. I do not deny that Hindus too are perpetrating such crimes, but both Jawaharlal and I have been strongly  condemning their misdeeds and publicly appealing to them to desist. Has any representative of the League made any such appeal to Muslims? Let the leaders fight if they want Pakistan. But how is it possible to carry on if everyone takes the law into his hands? Quaid-e- Azam Jinnah Saheb has given the assurance that full protection would be given to the minority community. But I must tell you that so far this assurance has not been fulfilled. I claim to be a faithful friend of all and I have to prove that friendship. It is my sincere appeal to you to treat Hindus as your own brethren. It will lead to your progress.

  DISCUSSION AT HINDUSTANI TALIMI SANGH 	MEETING 
 PATNA,
 April 23, 1947
 
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: The report from the U.P. was read out to us. Everyone felt that we should take over the basic schools from the local boards and run them ourselves. In a way it is desirable that the local boards alone should run such schools. But you are aware how they work. Even now it is the Government that plans out the programmes whereas the local boards are expected to implement them. The local boards embezzle funds and do not make regular payments to the teachers. It would therefore be better if the Government ran these schools.
GANDHIJI: At present I know nothing about them. Only after
 examining the working of the local boards will I be in a position to say something on this point. Just now I won’t commit myself to anything. I would only suggest that if the Government feels that it can shoulder this responsibility and the local boards are willing to hand over the schools, it should take them over.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: Then the report about the post-basic education was read out. After one month’s [training] the trainees are equipped to earn 8 as daily by working
 for 5 hours. Moreover, we have just commenced our work. Only after some time would  it be possible to make a correct estimate about it. The third point is regarding being self-supporting on which Jajuji will speak to you.
 JAJUJI: Seven years have passed since we introduced Nayee Talim. Even now it  is doubtful whether the students passing out of the basic schools can be self- supporting. The wages they can earn very from craft to craft. A student can earn two to three rupees if engaged in carpentry whereas spinning is a much less paying occupation. These days one earns much less if one does with the hands the work otherwise done in mills. They can, of course, earn 6 or 8 as, a day at the Charkha Sangh rates. But if we succeed in opening basic schools all over the country, the Charkha Sangh will not be in a position to buy all the yarn produced in these schools. Even today there is a large quantity of yarn which the Sangh is unable to buy And we shall get very little if we sell the yarn at the market rate. The Government may buy all the yarn spun in these schools. Under such circumstances which craft, do you think, should we adopt?
GANDHIJI: We should not think in terms of money as we do now.
 Khadi is the centre of our activities because we all need cloth and we have before us the question of clothing the seven lakhs of villages. Today, we get our yarn woven by offering higher wages to lure the weavers. It was wrong of me not to have insisted on  everybody weaving as I did in the case of spinning. It must, however, be seen that it does not require more time than can be spared for it. If it takes up all the time one can spare we shall have to think anew. The teacher under Nayee Talim will be a craftsman, not merely a wage-earner. His wife and children too must join him in his work. Only then will true co-operation be born. It would be a great achievement if we could take Nayee Talim to every village in India.
 Some people ask me why agriculture could not be the centre of Nayee Talim. The answer is that through agriculture no handicraft can be taught. The function of Nayee Talim is not merely to teach an occupation, but to develop the whole man through the teaching of handicrafts. It aims at helping the students to understand the essence of life. Nayee Talim endeavours to remove the imperfections of man.
 But though I do not begin with agriculture, it is bound to come in ultimately. We cannot do without it. One, of course, gets enough mental training in learning to grow fruits and vege- tables. Moreover, we also have to grow wheat for the students and provide them milk. All this cannot be accomplished under the old system. The field of Nayee Talim is more comprehensive. It has to determine the pattern
 of a whole life. A teacher of Nayee Talim should be a first-class craftsman. All the boys of the village will naturally live in the village and in co-operation with the teacher produce all they need in the village itself. In this way, the education would automatically become free and universal.
 Today the condition of India is such that the vegetables and fruit grown in a village are not consumed by the villagers themselves. The villagers of Travancore cannot use the coconuts that are grown there. They are collected at one place and sent to the towns. In the places where basic schools are opened the fruit grown will be first available to the villagers and then to others. Again, today we cultivate cash crops such as tobacco, cotton, indigo, etc. Those trained in Nayee Talim will cultivate crops which are essential for life.
 ZAKIR HUSAIN: The All-India Congress has appointed the Constructive Programme Committee with Nayakum, Jaju, Kumarappa, Shankarrao Deo, Jugal Kishore, Prafulla Babulibtech_764_footnote, Jairamdas Doulatram and Sucheta Kripalani as its memberslibtech_765_footnote.  In a meeting of the Committee held at Allahabad it was decided that the Talimi Sangh should run a training school and a basic school for a specified area in every province.
 JAJU: In accordance with the programme chalked out it was agreed that the work should be carried on by the Provincial Congress Committee, which would be allowed to raise funds for it. In this way we plan to train one lakh students in the country who will be self-supporting as regards cloth.
GANDHIJI: Today the Congress organization is not functioning
 smoothly. Wherever the Congress is in power, the Provincial Congress Committee and the Government should work in perfect co-operation and be a source of strength to each other. Today, each wishes to have his own way without having any regard for the other. They should work as one organic whole.
 SAMPURNANANDlibtech_766_footnote: This is not feasible. The Congress Ministries are keen to take up such tasks; you should get the work done by them. But you cannot accomplish this work through the Congress Committees. Today, the Congress Committees want to boss over the Government and this cannot be.
GANDHIJI:  It  might  be   suggested  that   the   Government should
 define their area of jurisdiction. Today, we cannot raise funds from the people. They would refuse to pay as they would have already made  their  contributions   to   the   Government.   We  should   tell the
 Ministers that so much funds are required for such and such constructive activity. If they refuse, we should protest to them and put before the people the correct position. But we cannot ask the public to donate for the work which the Government is capable of undertaking.
 AVINASHILINGAM: We do collect funds for the Harijans, don’t we? GANDHIJI: That is a different matter. It is our atonement.
 AVINASHILINGAM: The Government do not have enough funds to execute all the plans.
GANDHIJI: Of course, people should take up such work as the
Government cannot, and also raise funds for it.libtech_767_footnote
If we want to serve, our service should be in one direction alone.
 We have to cross an ocean. This is the time of our trial. We have to disperse the thunder-clouds gathering from all sides. There is no better guide than the Supreme Helmsman who can help maintain the balance and steer our ship in the right direction. Therefore everyone of us should gird up his loins and be prepared to perform his duty without finding fault with others.

  TALK WITH PEACE COMMITTEE MEMBERS 
 GANDHI CAMP, PATNA,
 April 23, 1947 We all want freedom. The Congress has ceaselessly striven to  attain it and made tremendous sacrifices for it. I feel we have become
indifferent in our loyalty to such a noble organization. If it is true, we
 had better disband the Congress or sever our connection with it. Do we want to let the splendid achievements of the Congress slip out of our hands? If you do not have the courage to follow the path of non- violence but whip the person who has flogged you, I can understand. But how can an Indian, being afraid of those who flog him, commit the crime of flogging the innocent by way of revenge? Even the use of violence is subject to certain rules ad regulations and failure to respect them leads to one’s own destruction. If I am unable to make you see this point which is clear as daylight, the fault is mine. If a man
 
 can meet death in the right manner, I would regard it as the fulfilment of his life. But the ill omens I am seeing before the advent of freedom, will lead to a greater slavery than the one you have been subjected to for the last 150 years and you will never get peace.
 The peace prevailing in Bihar at present is due to the force of the military, and I do not call it peace at all. When your peace brigade is able to influence people and they realize of their own accord that every Hindu or Muslim is their brother, sister or daughter, then alone will this peace endure. But you will be able to exercise your influence only if your dedication is one hundred per cent true, otherwise it would serve no purpose. Please do nothing just to please me. You are welcome to leave me alone if my words fail to carry conviction with you. But if after joining the peace brigade its soldier continues to think of revenge of any kind whatsoever, it would deeply hurt me. If either in retaliation or to avenge some evil done, you stoop to kill people professing religions other than your own, it would be regarded as an unmanly act and you will be endangering the freedom of India.
 If you want to cultivate the non-violence of the brave, you have to purify your hearts and discard cowardly thoughts  from  your minds. Why should one who has adopted non-violence be afraid of anyone? He will clearly explain his viewpoint to others without losing his temper at all. Therefore if you have any doubts, you can certainly ask me or Shribabu. I am happy to see Muslim brothers here in the Peace Committee. I will advise them also to frankly state whatever they consider proper and right. They should have the  courage  to  tell Jinnah Saheb publicly that by following the way of fighting and violence he will not be able to make Pakistan a holy land. If we continue to fight among ourselves we will have to forget freedom and some third power will come to subjugate us. Have you ever paused and thought what a golden land our India is? Instead of fighting over petty matters we should broaden our outlook. We have rich minerals, valuable metals and untold wealth of material in our country. We should make India prosperous by utilizing our time in discovering all this wealth. Instead, whither are we drifting, have you ever thought? Others will take advantage of our folly. If you have grasped what I have said, think over it and follow it in your  lives This will automatically help the people come into their own. A great moral responsibility lies on the shoulders of the workers. If you lack the
 
 requisite strength, admit it humbly otherwise carry  on  the responsibility you have undertaken, faithfully utilizing all your resources, physical, mental and material.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING      PATNA, 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  April 	23, 1947 
  	I keep my eyes closed during the prayer. Hence, I do not know if 	people take part in the Ramdhun. But Manubehn tells me that 	the women do not join the Ramdhun, nor do they beat time 	correctly. Those who come for the prayer meeting must abide by the 	rules of the gathering. Ramdhun is a collective prayer. When 	all men and women present at the prayer collectively utter Rama’s 	name and meditate on it, they feel the love of God kindled in their 	hearts. If all the people do not join the Ramdhun its purpose 	is not fulfilled. One must practise the Ramdhun even at home.  Ramdhun occupies an important place even in Nayee Talim. 	Nayee Talim begins at the age of seven and till the fourteenth year 	basic training is imparted. But what should a child do till he is 	seven years old? Actually, the mother should start training the 	child from the time she is carrying him inside her. This is not my 	experience but of the whole world, that while the child is still in 	the womb the  mother’s work and discipline have a great influence 	on the child’s life. This means that the mother can train the 	child from the time of conception till he is seven years old. This 	is followed by basic training till the child is fourteen years old. 	But Nayee Talim is necessary even for the old, in fact, for every 	man and woman as also for a labourer.  	But from where to get crores of rupees for educating the entire 	population? India is a very poor country. And we must spread 	literacy among the whole population of 400 million and the education 	of the child is to start from the time he is born One’s head 	starts reeling when one thinks about making all the necessary 	arrangements, finding so many teachers and the resources to pay 	them. You might ask me if my head too starts reeling. I should say, 	no. You might then think that either I am a stupid fellow who 	understands nothing, or I am very wise and know everything about it. 	This, in fact, is true. My head does not 
 reel. Nor am I given to talking in the air. Congress Ministers are  ruling in seven Provinces. In some Provinces the Muslim League is in power. Let them be considered separate for the time being, though I do not regard them as separate. One day they are bound to be united with us. True, they might not agree to give this type of training and the Congress wants to implement the programme of basic education. But how can I tell Suhrawardy Saheb that I want to impart basic education in Bengal? He would ask me what right I had to make any such suggestion. I can also work a lot in Sind. If we can give basic education to the people there the whole face of the province would change. The Hindus want to run away from there. They come to me and ask me what they should do. What they should do is another thing.
 All this time we had been having foreign education which also imposed a foreign language on us. This was because the  British  needed men to carry on their work and wanted their empire  to  expand. They needed clerks. I would have done the same thing if I were in their place. If I had needed doctors, engineers, etc., from where could I have found Englishmen for all these professions? How could Englishmen have communicated with the people of Bihar or those of Madras who speak Tamil? And so, they established big colleges and universities for the spread of English education. They started producing doctors and engineers, but in fact, they were turning out only loyal slaves. Even today we are living in the same age. Times cannot change merely by wishing. We are still enamoured of the English language. Work even in the Congress offices is being done in English. The notices I receive are also in English. Things have taken such a course that we cannot free ourselves from English easily. For that very reason the scheme of basic education has been prepared. It is a living education and a true education. English has not been given a place in it. A boy who has had basic education comes to his parents and proudly tells them what he has learnt. But if I study in an English school and my father from the village asks me what I learnt I would tell him only about England and the English people. If he asks me anything about my own place, about Bihar, I would not be able to tell him anything. But it does not imply that I should go on abusing the English people. As it is, I do not abuse anyone. The English say that this is our country and that they are going. When recently the Viceroy asked me to sign the peace appeal I said that I would sign in Hindi, Urdu, and I put my signature in Hindi, Urdu  and  English.  This pleased the Viceroy.
 Our average income today is Rs. 60-62 a year. Some people have an income of Rs. 60,000. This means that out of 400 million
 
 there must be so many without an income and they must starve. How can we educate all of them? Today we are almost paupers. How can we go on if our children do not get ghee, milk and clothing? We have to increase our income with the help of the right kind of training. Today our men and women have nothing to cover themselves with. I saw the same thing in Noakhali too. And let me tell you, in the old days—when I was in Champaran—the women had nothing  but a single sari. The women told me that they did not have more than one sari. How then could they bathe and what could they have to wear? And things were then far better compared to the present. Today cloth is so scarce. Food is also scarce. You must all get food to eat and clothes to wear. But the Government will not provide all these things for you. You must produce the grain yourselves. You must produce ghee and milk. You must make your own clothes. Your  children would help you.
 You have to make education self-supporting. Otherwise you cannot yourself become self-reliant. This virtue is to be found in Nayee Talim. The aim of Nayee Talim is not to make our children slaves. Nor does it aim at making them leaders. Its aim is to make all of them Indians.
 There should be food for everyone; but food does not mean only a handful of grain, a pinch of salt. As a matter of fact everyone ought to have pure ghee and milk and enough clothing. Today all this appears to be a mere dream. But it would not remain a dream. Nayee Talim will not make all students barristers, engineers or doctors. It aims at developing the students into good human beings. And we have to make them nothing less than good human beings.

 We should have only one colony set up for the refugees. You need not build pucca houses. You can have the houses built with mud and mortar as is the usual practice in villages. I would rather wish that people built such houses themselves and the Government paid them their proper wages. I consider it a sin to distribute food free.

  ADDRESS TO WORKERS 
 SADAQUAT ASHRAM, PATNA,
 April 24, 1947
 Lakshmi Babu’s complaints against the workers are a shame for Biharis. The subject of decentralizationlibtech_772_footnotelibtech_773_footnoteis being discussed for the past three years. I had mentioned it after my release from jail.libtech_774_footnotelibtech_775_footnoteThere was some mental reservation about it in the beginning. But now it is all clear to me. Lakshmi Babu had welcomed my suggestion right at the beginning. Only if you explain to me your difficulties in the plan for decentralization will I know where the trouble lies. It is not that the sales can be pushed up only under the patronage of the Charkha Sangh. It would only mean the ruin of khadi. Let khadi be for those who spin, so that there could be only genuine khadi-wearers. And I need only such genuine workers. This would mean the saving of the crores of rupees invested in the Charkha Sangh. Bihar has greatly increased the importance of spinning in India. The age of machines started only 200 or 300 years ago. Before that we used to do all the work with our hands and cheerfully too. With the advent of the machine age our hands have been cut off. Handicrafts and body labour are disappearing with the result that we have become lazy. Khadi will lose all its value if we turn the Charkha Sangh into a commercial body. People, whether in towns or in villages, should spin
 and wear khadi. It should be as natural as cooking one’s own food which is done in every home. This is not a very big thing. We shall all perish if we do not practise this. We are facing starvation because we do the things we ought not to do. India is a country poorer than even China. We appear to be human beings, but actually we live like animals. What would happen to the cow if human beings turn into animals? If every village in India became self-sufficient in the matter of food and clothing, we would easily save a billion rupees. I have no doubt about this. We would require no help from anyone, and the whole of India would become a co-operative enterprise. There are co- operative organizations in Japan and Germany. We too have among us ideal men like Lakshmi Babu and we must strengthen his hands. Decentralization is a teaching in itself. It has a wonderful significance like the daily lighting of the stove in every home for the day’s meals. If we are all ready for it and become self-sufficient in our khadi production, the experiment which Lakshmi Babu wants to carry on may well be the first of its kind in independent India. Vichitra Babulibtech_776_footnotein the U. P. has also made some efforts. But it would all be in vain unless we make all our villages self-sufficient.
 It is possible to develop yet another industry here. It is possible to produce beautiful cloth out of the stems of linseed. I have not the time, otherwise I would have proved that mill-cloth is like poison in effect, while khadi is like nectar. Khadi is meant for everyone. Even a depraved man, a sinner, a drunkard, a gambler, anybody, can wear it. But the sacred quality of khadi is that it is a symbol of freedom. Those who wish to live in free India ought to wear khadi. And those who wear khadi will be satyagrahis. They must be sattvika in the true sense of the term as described in the Gita.libtech_777_footnoteKhadi carries that quality.

  TALK WITH HARIJAN WORKERS 
 
 SADAQUAT ASHRAM, PATNA,
 [April 24, 1947]libtech_778_footnote
 In the meeting with the workers of the Harijan Sevak Sangh. . . a challenging poser was presented. The Harijans were asking why, if the caste Hindus were sincere in their professions of equality between the “touchables” and [the] “untouchables”, no inter-marriages were being celebrated. What should be the caste Hindus’ answer to that? Gandhiji replied that the Harijans had a right to ask that question. He had already conceded their point. Marriage was a strictly personal affair. While nobody could be compelled to contract a marriage against his or her will, on the ground of caste there should be no bar to such inter-marriages. He reminded them how he had long ago made  it a rule not to be present at, or give his blessings for any wedding unless one of the parties was a Harijan. Untouchability in the sense of pollution by touch had already become a thing of the past. What was needed now was the cultural and economic uplift of the Harijans, so that the very distinction between “touchables” and “untouchables” would be obliterated.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       PATNA, 
  April 	24, 1947    BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	Today I kept my eyes open during the Ramdhun to find out who 	among the women beat correct time and joined the Ramdhun. I 	found some women moving and clapping their hands, but they were not 	keeping the time! This wouldn’t do. I had told you yesterday that 	if all of you want to recite the name of God in unison and with 	single- minded concentration, you must learn the rules of collective 	prayer. When everyone recites the name of God with genuine feeling 	and with one voice, the blissful notes would give rise to a very 	pleasant,  
 delightful feeling. I can see the women because they sit right before me. But the men stand at a distance and I am not able to see them well. The dais on which I sit has been made like the stage in a theatre. There is special lighting arrangement so that people can have a good view of me, as of an actor on the stage. But the men stand in the dark. The light should be directed at the people. After all we are all in a way actors on the stage of life. I cannot see their hands but I can make out from the sound that they do not all join the Ramdhun. This is not good and it should not be.
 Some Harijan workers came to me this afternoon. I talked to them for an hour. We had a long discussion. Then I went to the Sadaquat Ashram where a meeting of the Harijan Sevak Sangh was held. The Harijan workers told me that there was very little feeling of untoucha-bility in Bihar. But I have heard that it is not true. Yesterday a shameful thing happened here. I came to know later that a few Harijan women had come to the prayer meeting, but some women did not allow them to sit down. They let their contempt by known and the Harijan women left the place. Had I known it yesterday, I would have talked about it. Today Hari-jan workers, both men and women, came to me. After hearing their tales I felt sad realizing that if those who considered themselves high caste, did not give up their fancied superiority and did not discard their unfounded pride, we would not be able to preserve our freedom even if it came.
 I say this not only for Patna or Bihar, but for the whole of India. Your Ministers are your elected representatives and they ought to guide you. Some people asked me if it was enough to touch the untouchable. I said no. The feeling of untouchability cannot be wiped out just by touching the untouchable.
 There was a time when the Hindus who considered themselves high-born never even touched the untouchables. But the people are now fairly enlightened. It is because of this awakening that we are now at the threshold of freedom. People no more mind inter-dining. But inter-marrying is still unmentionable. There are a number of high- placed men in Bankipur. If the untouchables come to their houses they are received with respect. They consider these men worthy of honour. But the untouchables cannot go to the houses of orthodox Brahmins or sanatani Hindus. These distinctions of touchable and untouchable are man made. Otherwise there is no such label of untouchability tagged on to anyone. I ceaselessly go on telling
 everyone that unless the blot of untouchability is removed Hinduism would be completely wiped out. I hope that the activities of the Charkha Sangh and Nayee Talim would be very useful in this field too.
 Actually we have committed a great crime, for which we ought to atone. I am sticking to this place in the hope that Bihar will do as much good as it has indulged in wrongs. The Hindus  should  so placate the Muslims by their conduct that they should be convinced that the Hindus committed a mistake once but that they are really not such senseless people.
 Another thing is that we must completely eradicate untouchability. I have already told you that Bihar is now independent of the Charkha Sangh. The headquarters of the Charkha Sangh are at Sevagram. Now Bihar has withdrawn itself from the central body and is free to produce as much khadi as it wants. Now you must think how Bihar should work. Bihar should take a concrete step in the right direction. I told you yesterday that Nayee Talim was a lofty tree and under its cool shade we could live in great comfort.
 Let the women remember that they should not repeat their mistakes. And those who committed the mistake should make amends by each one bringing with her one untouchable woman a day.

After all, how have you people reached such a high position? By whose efforts have you done it? Have you not been trained by me? If there can be such confusion in Bihar which belongs to Rajendra Babu, it seems I shall be able to say nothing to anyone. I do not like it. It pains me that even . . .libtech_781_footnoteBabu is not able to clarify the matter. He is efficient and  noble hearted. If he is seeking only my guidance, why are these strange things happening?

There is no reason to believe that all that I say is correct, but saying yes to whatever I say would make both of us guilty. Your
 consent should spring from your heart. If you are not convinced by my words you must try to persuade me. But we should not agree with anyone just in order to please him. The things that are happening in Bihar are extremely shameful. Please note it down in your diary that if things go on like this, once again India will have to be under the domination of the big three, viz., Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union.

 It is impossible not to admire your courage in surviving your cruel disability and retaining your mind unimpaired. Mine was no mere social call. It was a pleasure to meet you and listen to you. I never expected you to return that call. You have but to tell me that you would like me to see you again and I would gladly do so.
 I must confess that I had never realized until I came to Bihar the extent of damage to life and property by man become fiend for the time being. Let us hope that the awful scene will never be repeated in Bihar. My opposition to the formation of colonies is restricted to the Government co-operation even to the extent of land acquisition. I would have no objection to affected Muslims congregating in Muslim areas. There should be no check on free movement or congregation.
 Your legal acumen should have prevented you from making the sweeping remark that I had ever denied the right of self-defence. That right does not and ought not to carry with it the licence to bear arms. A moment’s reflection would show you its futility. What you want probably to convey is that it is the right of the  citizen,  however  humble he or she may be, to demand protection by the State against the thieves, robbers and miscreants. A Government that fails  to perform that duty forfeits all claim to govern. Let me add, too, that neither during my stay in England nor for 20 years in S[outh] Africa did I ever know a Westerner feeling incompetence to defend himself without arms when and if the occasion arose. Like several superstitions, this one you name seems to be confined only to this unhappy land of ours. Your gibe at the ministers and incidentally at me, though wholly irrelevant to your argument, is well deserved.
 I am wholly at one with you in your desire that the Congress and the League should live at peace with each other.

  TALK WITH ENGLISHMENlibtech_790_footnote 
 GANDHI CAMP, PATNA,
 April 25, 1947
 Sooner or later India is bound to get its freedom. Having made such tremendous sacrifices our earnest endeavour is not going to end in failure. But if the League co-operated with us we could  win  freedom tomorrow. The League representatives who have joined the Interim Government at present have not done so willingly. It would be  a happy union if only it is a sincere union. The world today needs action, not speeches. Our beliefs will have any value only if we put them into practice. Otherwise it is difficult to achieve anything. We have no doubt fought our battle with the weapons of truth and non- violence. Though, I must confess, I have not reached the ideal of my conception—as far as preparing the people on those lines is concerned, but so far as I know my own conscience I have myself striven through thought, word and deed to reach the ideal and am still striving to do so. If unconsciously I have been guilty of a lapse, I am not aware of it. But no society of men can ever be happy at all without following the path of non-violence. This doctrine is not of my invention, it is something that has been followed from time immemorial. A country like Russia which stood by the rights of its people has been caught up in establish- ing an imperialistic State. How tragic it is! I hold that he who invented the atom bomb has committed the gravest sin in the world of science. The only weapon that can save the world is non-violence. Considering the trend of the world, I might appear a fool to everyone; but I do not feel sorry for it. I rather consider it a great blessing that God did not make me capable of inventing the atom bomb.
 It is wrong to say that the people in the West have gone crazy about the atom bomb. There are also people among them who are having second thoughts about it. I can make this assertion in full faith and with conviction that people will be happy and content only where truth and non-violence are followed. Though at present both appear to have disappeared they have not disappeared entirely. You inquired about foreigners. I may say that ultimately they can stay here only if they are willing to stay as Indians. Otherwise there is no place for them here. After India achieves freedom, we have to cultivate
 
 friendship with the people of other countries and avoid all discord. We are aware that we might commit many mistakes and face innumerable difficulties in safeguarding our freedom. It is quite possible we may fall short of the expectations of our people. But I see no danger in that. We will learn only through our mistakes and trials. But if the Congress renounces truth and non-violence, its moral strength and its prestige are bound to suffer. But truth and non-violence have to be followed willingly. Then alone can they endure. Nothing done under compulsion will endure. Such rules are not written in a constitution. I can go to the extent of saying that just as it is essential to wear clothes—irrespective of whether they are good or bad—and we have accepted the principle of covering our body, similarly it is imperative that every human being should adopt truth and non-violence.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING      PATNA, 
  April 	25, 1947    BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	I am going to speak to you today about something which has just come 	to my notice. It is a subject close to the hearts of the Hindus, 	viz., cow-protection. I wrote a book called Hind Swarajlibtech_791_footnotewhen I was in South Africa. That was in 1909libtech_792_footnote,that is, 40 years ago. In those days too I held the 	same views as I do now. There was a statement in the book saying 	that I considered the cow as our mother and I have an honoured place 	for her in my heart because she gives me milk. If I want to protect 	myself, I must also protect the cow. The cow is worshipped even in 	Bihar. But, as I wrote in 1909, even though we claim to protect the 	cow, in fact we are killing her. Many Hindus were angry with me for 	making such a statement. But I was firm in my view.  	Nowhere else in the world is the condition of the cow as poor as in 	India. If we look at the way we treat our cows, it would be clear to 	us that even though we claim to worship the cow, in our hearts we 	have no true respect for her. We treat the cow very harshly. Look at 	it from     
 my point of view and think of the hard work we extract from the bullocks. It is a mute animal and cannot complain. But we yoke the bullocks to the cart and load it so heavily that we do not even bother to think that the cart might give way. And, when the bullocks cannot move we beat them mercilessly. We give no thought to the health of the bullocks. When I see their bones sticking out, I wonder how they manage to walk at all. The bullocks’ condition is similar to the poor people’s. Just as a poor man does not get ghee, milk, and so on, the cattle too do not get proper fodder. Experts say that either the animal world will destroy us, or it will be our duty to kill them in order to survive. If that happens people will ridicule us that we, the cow- worshippers, have taken to cow-slaughter.
 However, for protecting the cow, instead of laying down our own lives we kill others. And whom do we go and kill? The British? Of course not. How can we kill them? They are powerful, and even though they are few in number, they are the rulers. They possess arms. They consume as many cows as they wish. They trade in beef. They take away from India any number of cows of healthy and good breed to slaughter them. These cows are not sold by the Muslims, for they do not keep cows in such large numbers. It is you who sell the cows to them. Then they sell beef tea to us which we consume. Our children consume it too because the doctors recommend it. I have a Vaishnava friend who had beef tea saying he had to take it because his doctor said that he would not survive without it.
 I have heard some Bihari Hindus complain that the Muslims slaughter our cows. Why then should the Muslims not be killed, they ask. Even in 1908 when I was in South Africa I used to be amused at the Hindus’ claim that there were several societies for cow-protection. Here too people go about collecting funds for cow-protection. But how can we protect the cow when we kill our own brethren? You cannot kill the British because they are strong. Today if they are going it does not mean that you have grown stronger or that they have grown weaker. They have decided to leave because the force of our satyagraha has compelled them to go. It will have to be accepted that they are honest, because in the matter of leaving the country they have shown much honesty. When they came, you could have told them that they should not eat beef. You could have told them that if they ate beef, cow’s ghee or milk would not be available and that they could manage to live without beef. But in America and England where people freely eat beef the cow is very well protected. They raise the cows very well and milk them properly, and they sell pure milk. But as for you, you sell ghee by adulterating it with fat. You also sell vegetable ghee. You consume beef tea and beef extract too; but if the
 Muslims eat beef you kill them. I once stayed with Maulana Abdul Bari Saheb of Firangi Mahal at Lucknow. He left us long ago. He said that if the cow was so useful to us, it was our duty also to protect her. In those days the Hindus and the Muslims used to be united and they had no quarrels. Had we maintained the same friendly relations, the Muslims would have given up beef-eating. You also said that a large number of cows were saved in one year. Nowhere in the Koran is it said that it is one’s duty to eat beef. But if we forcibly stop the Muslims it would become obligatory for them to eat it. I wish to tell you about it because complaints have been made not by one but many Hindus. If we wish to create an atmosphere of harmony, we ought to give up such methods of coercion.
 Some work of cow-protection is being done in the U.P., Bihar, Gujarat, the C.P. and other places. For that matter there are also some Hindus who insist on eating beef. They also quote a Sanskrit shloka which shows that in the ancient times even Brahmins used to eat beef. That is not incorrect either. It is another matter if the passage is interpreted differently. No one ever mentions cow-protection in  Andhra and Madras. If we want to protect the cow we must know our dharma, know what true compassion is, learn how to look after cattle. In our country this is not done properly even in the dairies. I have had a hand in the setting up of the Goseva Sangh.libtech_793_footnotelibtech_794_footnoteIt is our duty to protect the cow. In fact, I would say it is the duty of every human being, because taking cow’s milk and ghee is beneficial to everyone. Even the non-vegetarians have to take ghee, milk, and so on. Buffalo’s milk is not as good as cow’s milk. But that does not mean that I do not wish the buffalo to exist. If the cow is saved, the buffalo would be saved too. But the cow cannot be saved in the way we are trying to do  it at present. We are blinded by selfishness and a feeling of animosity. We ought to learn from England and America how to rear cattle. Our knowledge of the subject at present is very poor. There is need for us to learn from other countries how to rear cattle, what fodder we should give them and the proper way to milk them. First of all we must try to cultivate humility in order to protect the cow. Let us not be angry with anyone. On the contrary, let us try to protect the cow by persuading others. That alone would render our efforts successful.

  TALK WITH SITA AND SUMITRA GANDHIlibtech_795_footnote 
 GANDHI CAMP, PATNA,
 April 26, 1947
 One may give up everything but not prayer. Prayer is the broom that sweeps clean our minds. If we stop praying, all the rubbish and cobwebs will accumulate in our minds and make our inner being impure. I expect all of you who are in the college to get up early and create an atmosphere for prayer. It has been my wish—and will always be wherever I am till I breathe my last—that every member of the Ashram, boy or girl, man or woman, wherever he or she may be, should create the atmosphere of the Ashram. If nothing else, at least spinning, simple food, simplicity, khadi and prayer ought to become the permanent features in one’s life after one has stayed in  the Ashram. But what can you do in this respect? Not all the desires of man are ever fulfilled. It seems the fault is only mine and this is only a reflection of my imperfection.

   LETTER TO SUSHILA GANDHI       PATNA, 
     CHI. 	SUSHILA,  April 	26, 1947 
  	I have been working under such heavy pressure that I could not find 	time even to write a letter to you and send it with Sita. I meant to 	write yesterday but could not. I read just now Manilal’s letter 	which you had sent to Kishorelal and which the latter had for- 	warded to me. Such is my condition. God, however, has preserved my 	health so far and will preserve it as long as He wants to take work 	from me.  	Since Sita had come and met me, she herself told me that there was 	no need for me to write a letter, but that an oral message would 	suffice. I agreed with her. I have discussed the matter with her as 	fully as possible. There is no need whatever for you to worry about 	her. You must have seen the letter she wrote to Krishnakumar and the 	one I wrote to him. You will learn everything from them. Please 	therefore do not worry about her at all. And as Kishorelal suggests, 	it is now desirable that you should go and join Manilal. If you 	wish, you may come and see me. I shall have to go to Delhi on May 2. 	You may come and see me there if you like. But it is very hot now. 	If you wish to escape the heat and don’t wish to come, you may 	not. We may discuss the more important problems through 	correspondence and should be satisfied with that.  	I am returning Manilal’s letter. My heart endorses the different 	view which you two have taken. Since I am the property of the 	masses, they have a perfect right to search me inside out. But, even 	so, if the masses seek to press their point of view on me,  I  would 	 feel suffocated.  	About Kishorelal and others it is a different matter. They are, 	after all, co-workers who seek guidance from me. If they disapprove 	of any action or views of mine today, they should have the right to 	discuss them fully. The painful thing in this matter is that their 	approach and mine to the question seem different. Conduct based on 	such [different] approach is bound to be at variance [with their 	views] and cannot but give pain. My ideas and conduct are not new. I 	can say that they go back to fifty five years ago. It is possible 	that I might not have been able to express my ideas clearly in my 	writings or talks. 
 I don’t say positively that I have written on the subject, only because if I could spare the time to go over all my writings I might be able to quote the statements I have made from time to time. But what is to be gained by doing so? The action has already been abandoned for the present. As for my views, Kishorelal and I have been discussing them [through letters]. That discussion need not be stopped, nor need it upset anybody. If there is any error in my reasoning, the discussion may help to remove it. Or, if there is no possibility of either of us changing his view, we will put up with the difference in our views and also in our conduct. I am hopeful that that will not be the outcome. One or the other will correct his error and both will come to the same view. I am hoping, however, that Kishorelal and others who are non- co-operating with me partially will withdraw their non-co-operation.
I hope you are all unperturbed.

  A LETTER 
 April 26, 1947
 I have gone through your reportlibtech_798_footnotelibtech_799_footnote. If it had been a statement expressing your personal views I would have complimented you and would have made some important suggestions too. You are a great economist and a learned man and you are running a flourishing business. But I know more about village industries. Hence we have proceeded on the understanding that I am qualified to instruct you. Even if there were no such understanding, I, at any rate, have proceeded on that assumption. In doing so I have not been prompted by my ego. But such is the situation today. What I have read concerns the Committee appointed by the Government of Bombay, and you are presiding over it. From that point of view I have much to say about the statement. Fortunately we had here meetings of the Trustees of the Charkha Sangh and members of the Nayee Talim in which Kumarappalibtech_800_footnotelibtech_801_footnoteand Dhotrelibtech_802_footnotelibtech_803_footnotewere present. Hence I could exchange views with both of them. . . . libtech_804_footnoteI am not able to look up Harijan at present. I do not send for the matter before it is printed. Pyarelal too has not been writing for it.
 I do not approve of the very resolution which has led to the appointment of the Committee. In my view Lakshmidaslibtech_805_footnotelibtech_806_footnoteand Dhotre cannot function under that resolution. Before passing the resolution the Government of Bombay should have consulted the Charkha Sangh, the Gramodyog Sangh and the Hindustani Talimi Sangh. You are probably not aware that all these three organizations have the backing of the Congress and are known as Congress organizations. No other organization in India has or is likely to  have  more experience in the field of village industries. But I still cannot say how such a mistake could happen. Considering your intelligence I feel that you ought to have stopped Lakshmidas and Dhotre from signing the report. I would also say that even you could not have prepared such a report by yourself, because, if you prepare a report  disregarding certain basic facts, it would be like raising a structure on sand. This is what has happened with regard to this report. At the moment I am not in a position to suggest anything more. If you have the courage I
 
 what has happened with regard to this report. At the moment I am not in a position to suggest anything more. If you have the courage I would suggest that you write to the Government of Bombay that the report is incomplete and should not be implemented straightaway. Dhotre has withdrawn his endorsement.

 . . . must have written you a detailed letter. You have given your name for the Gramodyog Samiti of the Government of Bombay. But in my view you could not have done so as the Samiti would be functioning under the instructions of the Government. Moreover, you should have consulted the Charkha Sangh, the Gramodyog Sangh and the Talimi Sangh and sought their opinion. There is much to be said about its merits and demerits, but I leave it out. It your views have undergone a fundamental change, it would be an altogether different matter. But I do not think this is the case. In my view, you must put your signature to the letter Dhotre has written to Balasaheblibtech_808_footnote. Before the Government starts acting on the report, it must clearly understand our policy.

     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  April 	26, 1947 
  	Since I have to visit the Muslim brethren I do not wish to give you 	the whole of my time today. You must have heard of Maulana Shafi 	Daudi. I came to know about him when I had come to Bihar for the 	first time. Later I went to his house also. On his invitation I have 	promised to attend a meeting of the Jamiat-e-Islam. I therefore wish 	to leave early.  	Please remember what I told you about the cow yesterday. I told the 	goshala people who came to see me today that they should all 	come to me together. Then I would tell them what could be done to 	improve the breed of the cow. They too agree that the condition of 	the cow anywhere in India is not as bad as in Bihar. This is an 	exaggeration, for the condition of cattle in some other parts of 	India is found to be worse than in Bihar. All the same, according to 	me, it would suffice to say that the condition of cattle in India is 	the worst in the whole world. This is a matter of great shame and a 	blot on us since we call the cow our mother and worship her. If we 	had been following our dharma India’s name would not have been 	tarnished. We must remove this blot.  	I hope you will think over what I have told you, for I shall say no 	more today. [From 	Urdu]  Gandhijike 	Dukhe Dilki Pukar—III, 	p. 44

 It is my view that we must make the whole village a health resort. The hospital has no place in it. We must be satisfied with what little we may be able to do in the prevention of disease. Present-day doctors have no place in the scheme of my conception. We must be content with medical herbs available in our villages and fields. Ramanama is the unfailing remedy.

   TALK WITH MUSLIM WOMEN  
 GANDHI CAMP, PATNA,
 April 27, 1947 Now we can hope that India is shortly going to become free. If women    were   to    make   a    resolve,   they   could   demonstrate  the
remarkable strength bestowed on them by God. And it is essential for
 it that you should pray daily. But today prayer has come to  be regarded either as a pastime of old women or of those who have retired from life. And I can quote such instances where young men and women regard prayer, bhajans or discourses as something ridiculous and worthless. This has led to our present degeneration. But if we can understand the secret of prayer, we would realize its wonderful power. Our indepen-dence will be stable if we attain it through prayer. But spiritually in-clined men and women should also
 understand the secret of non-violence. We should realize that if our non-violence is the non-violence of the weak, our independence will not be stable. And it will further prove that we cannot  protect ourselves even with weapons, for we have neither arms nor training in their use. We have the wonderful and unrivalled weapon of truth and non-violence. Not only for winning freedom but also for preserving it there is no alternative to ahimsa. Those who regard us as their  enemies, can be won over by love and non-violence alone. Women can easily accomplish this. Let me give a simple example. You marry your daughter aged fourteen, fifteen or sixteen into a strange new family and hand her over to a stranger; the girl becomes one with the new family or after a short while even becomes the mistress of that household. How does this happen? God has blessed her with a loving heart. She can win over everyone with her love, affection and non- violence. This is our every-day experience. Similarly in the larger context of society, if you learn to treat your Hindu sisters as your friends and try to emulate their good qualities they will certainly reciprocate. Women have the remarkable capacity for sacrifice.
 Under varying situations in life and in order to advance or strengthen your country you should learn to efface the self and meet death bravely with prayer in your heart, whenever the occasion demands it. In order to cultivate the courage to meet death, prayer is the first and the last mantra of the art of dying. Implicit faith is essential for it. Without faith, no satyagrahi can ever succeed. Rama, Rahim, God or Allah—call Him by any name you like, His Law is universal.
 Think over what I have said. You have come in purdah but the real meaning of observing purdah is that you should guard against lust, anger and attachment. That is, one has to exercise restraint over oneself. This outward purdah is mere hypocrisy. Its observance is meaningless if one’s heart is impure.

   TALK WITH I. N. A. MEN  
 April 27, 1947
 Should we not refer to the I.N.A. as non-violent I.N.A.? this is because you cannot expect to hear anything else from me. Subhas
 Babu was like my own son. Even though there were differences in our views, I admire his capacity for work and his patriotism. We shall be able to win freedom only through the principles the Congress has adopted for the past thirty years. We should not look upon anyone as our enemy. We must give up the feeling of animosity and vindictiveness and we shall have to become  sthitaprajnalibtech_817_footnote.  As  I  am saying this you may be thinking that you are not mahatmas after all. But this principle is not meant for mahatmas alone. Anyone who wishes to be happy has no alternative but to adopt this principle in his life.
 It is all very well that you fought with arms in foreign countries. But you saw the result. You have gained nothing thereby. Of course, you faced many hardships with courage. But Netaji himself has said that while in India you have got to work within the Congress. Just as you had tried to defend your army with force of arms in Burma and prepared for the attainment of freedom, you must now work to wipe out communal differences with the force of love and non-violence. You must eschew all differences of caste and creed and considering every woman your mother, sister or daughter you should accomplish the task which Netaji began. A remarkable spirit which Netaji has inculcated in the I.N.A. is that there are no distinctions among the soldiers. You must carry that spirit to every home.
 You must thoroughly convince yourselves that developing spiritual strength is a thousand times more difficult than developing the strength of the sword.
 As far as food, sleep and so on, are concerned, there is no difference between human beings and animals. Even so, today we have a choice only between human life and animal existence. We in India have wonderful religious treatises. But let me tell you that all that spiritual preaching has been of no avail. We are not able to translate anything from those scriptures into practice. I venture to state with all humility that the path of non-violence is the path leading to God and only the brave can follow it as the poetlibtech_818_footnotesays: “The path of God is for the brave.” Who is this God? He is not a corporeal human being. You should develop this strength of the brave. You will then be able to perpetuate Netaji’s name in every village and every corner of India and keep it alive for ages to come. That means that Netaji lives
 
 even though he may not exist in the body. It is wrong to think that only an embodied person exists and that a dead person does not. A person whose name has become immortal,  who  rendered incomparable service and who used to rush to help the poor, lives for ever even after death.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 April 27, 1947
 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 The bhajanlibtech_819_footnotelibtech_820_footnoteyou heard just now was sung before also. I want to give you something of the background of this bhajan. It first echoed in my ears when I went on a fast while in jail. But while fasting one’s memory becomes weak. None of my co-workers remembered the bhajan fully either. And so I sent a telegram and the bhajan was sent to me telegraphically in the Roman script. The bhajan delighted me so much that I forgot my fast. My grandson Kanu was with me at the time. At my request he sang it for me. There is nothing special about this bhajan  by Tulsidas. He only says that he lives by two syllableslibtech_821_footnotelibtech_822_footnote. Everything, he says, is accomplished only with the help of Rama. All other gods are amenable to offerings. For, when people go to worship the deities they offer a couple of pice before offering their prayers. The mother of a sick child offers a little money before praying for the recovery of her child. Another woman offers money to Lord Mahadeva pleading to be spared the nightmares she goes through. Some other woman who has too many daughters prays for a son. But all this is futile. Tulsidas says that God needs no flattery.
 I told you yesterday that I was going to a meeting of Muslims. It was a function of Jamiat-e-Islam. In a way it is an association of fakirs. But they are not the fakirs who live by begging. They do not beg for money but they are fakirs at heart. If they eat at somebody’s cost,

 they first do some work for him. They say that all human beings are servants of the One God and all should abide by His command. One cannot meet God merely by visiting a mosque or a temple; the real thing is to do His work.
 I felt that someone might now think that since Bihar has just 13 or 14 per cent Muslim population and the rest are Hindus, why placate the Muslims? But I say that if the Muslims invite me with love I shall go to them even barefoot. But, born though I am in a Hindu family and brought up in the Hindu tradition, I will not go to visit a big Hindu if he orders me to do so. But here the Muslims are few in number, and so I would walk barefoot to their houses. Yesterday I went in a car because I had to go very far and I would not have otherwise reached there in time. If the Hindus think that I am trying to give undue importance to the Muslims, they are mistaken. I  have come here only to see that they get what is their due. The Congress is in power here and it was not strictly necessary for me to come and see to it myself; but I came just the same.
 It is also wrong to quarrel with anyone over the names—Rama or Rahim. For, whether we say Rama or Rahim, Krishna or Karim, God or Allah, we mean the One God.
 There was a mention of the child Rama in the bhajan which was sung yesterday. Tulsidas has sung to the glory of Ramanama so much that you would find his Ramayana recited wherever you go in the country. Although there are many other epics in India they are not so steeped in devotion. On seeing an image of Krishna, Tulsidas is believed to have said: “Tulsi’s head would bow down to you only if you take up the bow and arrowlibtech_823_footnote.” He was a devotee of Rama. Hence he insisted that he would bow to Krishna only if he appeared before him in the form of Rama. Even you, if you are worshippers of Rama, should love everyone. There was a time when it used to be said that if one wanted to know what true religion was, one
 should visit India. That was because the Hindus did not kill anyone. But now there are robbers, dacoits and also murderers among the Hindus. Let me warn you, however, that if you let the fact of the Hindu majority turn your head and attempt to eliminate other people, Hinduism is not going to benefit in any way. On the contrary, it would perish.
Let me wind up by referring to the point about two syllables. If
 
 you are worshippers of Rama, you must also accept that Rama belongs to all. He is the Saviour of all, whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Parsi. And whoever wishes to worship Rama should do so sincerely.

   A NOTE  
 PATNA,
 April 28, 1947
 I have read the note left with me by Mr. Houltonlibtech_824_footnotelibtech_825_footnote. I am quite clear in my mind that those Muslims in the affected areas who by reason of fear or the distressing memory of their dead kinsmen do not wish to return to their homes should have the option of settling where they like even outside Bihar against compensation being  given  to them for loss of land and tenements, which will revert to the State. Compensation will consist of the sum fixed by valuators at the present rates of land and habitable tenements in place of those destroyed by the rioters. The valuation of the tenements must not exceed Rs. 1,000 at the outside. The above having been conceived purely  in  the  interests of the sufferers, it presumes every previous effort being made by the State to dispel all fear of repetition of tragedy by adequate police protection and ridding the place of known marauders, etc.

    LETTER TO SYED ABDUL AZIZ        PATNA, 
    DEAR 	FRIEND,  April 	28, 1947 
  Of 	course there could be no question of annoyance caused by your 	letters. You are too courteous to cause any. Where frankness is the 	common article of exchange nothing but good can be the result in the 	end. If 	any of my actions were based on the attitude of the ministers,    
 I should be of little use here.libtech_826_footnotelibtech_827_footnoteI have come, if   I  can,  to  serve  the Muslim minority in Bihar as I was in Noakhali to serve the Hindu minority. In so doing my fond belief was and is that I should serve the majority too. Thus I was and am against pockets promoted by  authority in either case and so against firearms. That way lies strife, not friendship whose roots are firmly fixed in love, not fear. Man can but perish in the attempt. Success is from God.
 If the Hindus are to be considered as a hostile community for all time, I confess that the segregation is the safest policy. That is the logic of Pakistan which I have opposed, knowing full well that I might find myself in the minority of one.
 When ministers and I cannot live without armed guards, you undoubtedly prove our cowardly impotence but do not sustain your argument for possession of firearms by  impotent  men.libtech_828_footnoteFancy  me carrying a pistol for self-defence ! ! !

   LETTER TO SECRETARY, MUSLIM LEAGUE  
 April 28, 1947
 . . .libtech_829_footnotelibtech_830_footnoteSuch Muslims as regard India as their home will always be welcome to stay here and it will be the duty of the Government to give them full protection. At the same time the Muslims too should be conscious of their own duty and must realize that if they continue to harbour hatred in their hearts against the Hindus, it will jeopardize the future of the crores of Indian Muslims. I have received complaints that the harassment of the minority community  in  the  Muslim majority areas of Bihar has the passive support and sympathy of other Muslims. I see no good coming out of it, if it is true.

  	I read your letter again. I do not wish to lose any of you. Whoever 	goes, will go of his own accord. You do have the capacity to work. I 	like that, but the lack of harmony among you all pains me. You ought 	to be keen to have it removed.  	I see no need to do anything [ in this matter ] till I return from 	Delhi. Nor do I wish to show your letter. This is a matter which you 	should discuss with them. You should listen to what they have to 	say. If you do not have the courage nor the desire to do so you 	should forget the thing. If you wish to come to a decision before I 	leave for Delhi, you should yourself discuss the matter with them 	immediately today, or take whatever other action you wish to.

  	I have your postcard. You are studying, but you have not learnt to 	use your common sense. You wrote to me and asked me to write to you 	at the Hospital address. I did so, and now you complain of not 	having received any letter from me. Sushila is ill, and so I try to 	write daily. If you are going to value my love from the number of 	letters I write or your being able to meet me, I must acknowledge 	defeat right from the beginning. I write to Manilal at long 	intervals and only when necessary. To my own sister I never write, 	and to Devdas I write once in four to six months. Tell me now, with 	what are you going to measure my love? Do learn to use some common 	sense.  	I still do not know whether or not you have gone  to  the  Hospital.

   LETTER TO SATIS CHANDRA DAS GUPTA  
 
        CHI. 	SATIS BABU,  PATNA,  April 	28, 1947 
  	I have your letter. Now I can go there only after my return from 	Delhi. We shall know more after Nirmal Babu’s arrival.  	There is a report in the Hindustan Standard about  	some incidents in Comilla. Do you know anything about it? I have 	passed it on to Sailen. Dr. Mahmud has not yet returned. He is 	coming on Wednesday. Perhaps he will travel with me.  Blessings 	from  BAPU    From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G. N. 9078      ADVICE TO STUDENTS    PATNA,  April 	28, 1947  	If we could shake off our lethargy we would be true socialists. But 	we haven’t yet done that. If I were to ask you I am sure to get 	the reply that all fifteen of you have servants in your homes.libtech_831_footnote  	Well, then I fail to understand your desire to serve others — 	which you call socialism—when you do not do your own personal work 	in your homes. If you want my advice, I may  	tell you that students while they are studying should not involve 	themselves in any ism. They may by all means read about every school 	of thought, think over it, put as much of it into practice as 	possible, but they should not endeavour to become leaders. If we 	want to banish exploitation and violence from our society, we ought 	to do body-labour and manual work. And naturally it ought to be 	undertaken by all. Unemployment is rampant in our villages which 	were [once] regarded as happy and self-sufficient units; this is 	because of our subjugation and feelings of high and low as also 	caste distinctions.    
 Our political slavery is now nearly coming to an end. Hence we now need to become all the more vigilant and in this process the students can prove very helpful. For example, (1) when you get up in the morning you can roll up your own bedding; (2) help in preparing your breakfast and milk, etc., whatever you take, without waiting for your mother or anyone else to prepare it and serve you; (3) give a helping hand in sweeping and scrubbing; (4) do  your  own laundering; (5) help your mother with the cooking and cleaning the dishes; (6) make your own cloth by spinning regularly every day; (7) keep your books clean and neatly arranged, economize on exercise- books as much as possible; (8) learn to do with a pen-holder and ink costing two annas, instead of a fountain-pen costing Rs. 50.
 If you adopt a number of such rules in your life you will not need to bother with any ism. And if every student in the country does it, I am sure the guardians’ burden will be lightened a thousand times and without making any other effort we will be called socialists. But I doubt if you will follow what I say. All the same, when you return home please reflect if there is any sense in the few lines that this experienced old fellow wrote out for you on his day of silence.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING libtech_832_footnote        PATNA, 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  April 	28, 1947 
  	I am sorry to let you know that I shall have to go to Delhi by the 	morning train the day after tomorrow. There is a call from Pandit 	Nehru. Congress President Shri Kripalani has also sent a telegram 	from Rajputana that I should be in Delhi by the first of May. The 	Congress Working Committee is to meet there the next day. It pains 	me to have to leave you at this stage. I do not relish the idea of 	leaving Bihar unless the Mussalmans have completely shed their fear 	and both the communities allow me to leave cheerfully. I felt the 	same thing when I left Noakhali. For both these places I have the 	same motto before me “Do or Die”. The cause in both the places 	is the same. My  
 non-violence bids me dedicate myself to the service of the minorities. It would be a new birth for me and would give me new strength if the Hindus and the Mussalmans of both these places become friends and shed their animosity. God alone knows what will happen ultimately. Man can only try and perish in the attempt to do God’s work. God is all in all. We are only zeroes. The same mission takes me to Delhi, that is, to work for Hindus and Muslims. I hope to return within a short time and be among you.
 You may be astonished to learn that I continue to receive letters charging me with having compromised the interests of the Hindus by acting as a friend of the Muslims. How can I carry conviction with the people by mere words if the sixty years of my public life have failed to convince them that by trying to befriend Muslims I have only proved myself a true Hindu and have rightly served the Hindus and Hinduism? The essence of true religious teaching is that one should serve and befriend all and should be enemy of none. I learnt this in my mother’s lap. You may refuse to call me a Hindu. I would only quote a line from Iqbal’s famous song which means “Religion does not teach us to bear ill will towards one another”.libtech_833_footnoteIt is easy enough to be friendly to one’s friends, but to befriend the one who regards himself as your enemy is true religion. All else is mere business.

   REMARK TO MANU GANDHI libtech_834_footnote  
 
GANDHI CAMP, PATNA,
 April 28, 1947
 How can we afford to forget the charkha? The spirit behind spinning implies equality of all. The charkha teaches us the unique lesson of identifying ourselves with the forty crores and be in perfect harmony with them. It will not admit of any distinction of high and low, master and servant, which is the cause of conflict in the world today, isn’t it? The charkha warns us against it. How can we, therefore, fail to worship God in the form of the charkha?

  	In acknowledging your kind letterlibtech_835_footnotelibtech_836_footnoteof 	even date, I must say that my impression was that our correspondence 	was meant for knowing each other better. But I have no objection 	whatsoever to  your releasing the correspondence to the Press.

You are less than right when you say that “the policy of the Govt. 	 .  .  for  good”libtech_837_footnote. 	My policy is no firearms to civilians in the ordinary course and 	perfect protection to every citizen be he poor or

 I am surrounded by exaggeration and untruth. In spite of my search, I do not know where truth lies. But I do feel that I have come nearer to God and Truth. It has cost me quite a few of my old friends but I do not regret it. To me it is a sign of my having come nearer to God. That is why I can write and speak frankly to everyone. I have successfully practised the eleven vows undertaken by me. This is the culmination of my striving for the last sixty years. You have become an instrument in this. In this yajna I got a glimpse of the ideal of truth and purity for which I had been aspiring. And you have fully contributed towards it. Still, being so young, you cannot at present realize the implications of this yajna. I daily go through your diary which reminds me of Mahadev. Seeing what you write and study these days and the ability you have to understand the yajna I feel that had Mahadev been alive this girl would have developed differently. I can’t give you enough time much as I would like to. Mahadev surpassed me in certain qualities. Since no one is accompanying me during the walk today, I had the time to tell you all this.

   DISCUSSION AT PEACE COMMITTEE MEETING libtech_842_footnote  
 PATNA,
 April 29, 1947
 
 Q. What should be the attitude of the Peace Committee towards the culprits who have not been arrested and those who are under suspicion? Should the workers of the Committee co-operate in getting such persons arrested and prosecuted and in carrying on the investigations ?
 GANDHIJI: The duty of the Peace Committee is to supply all the information to the authorities. If the officers are corrupt the Ministers should be informed. The matter should be brought to the notice of the Press. Let those who have seen with their own eyes murders or other criminal acts being committed give the culprits’ names to the police. The members of the Peace Committee could  even  try  to reform the offender and persuade him to go to the police and confess his crime. The Government should take public opinion into consideration. Suhrawardy Saheb says that the police who are the eyes and ears of the Government do not report any untoward incident, whatever Satis Babu might say. I say that the police are the deaf ears and blind eyes of the Government. It is our task to awaken the police. If in the face of arson, murder and abduction of women an officer maintains that for want of evidence culprits cannot be arrested he deserves to be dismissed. How can a helpless victim produce any evidence? And if anybody says that he himself set his house on fire, it is sheer nonsense. Would the poor man burn his own house? He is too terror-stricken to do so.
 If the Government were not to trust public opinion it would mean heavy expenditure and inconvenience. It would then need
 C.I.D. men in large numbers. That is the way of the  alien  Government. Under a swadeshi government the people are the C.I.D. for the government. If there is popular rule there would be fewer rogues. Otherwise, the Government would be in the hands of rogues. A government full of rogues can also function, but where I cannot say. Even the Congress Government can turn out to be such a government.
 
 You have mentioned lack of workers for the Peace Committee. It only means that we have no influence over the masses. And if we haven’t, what is the reason behind it? It implies that something is lacking in us. And we ought to get over our limitations.
 Q. Occasionally we receive news about trouble in various places. Even where there have been no riots people are in panic because of the vitiated atmosphere, and are running away. Some mischief-mongers have gone into hiding in other places and are misleading the people. How should the workers of the Peace Committee proceed under these circumstances ?
 A. Whatever news we receive is not all correct. But no doubt there is trouble in some places. The Peace Committee should help the Government in every way. Most of the people present here would, of course, be Congressmen. If so, it is their duty to help the Government. And if they do not do so it means that the Government does not have popular support. If would be shameful to say that our public opinion reflects a mob mentality. It is our duty, not the Government’s, to mould public opinion. The Government’s responsibility is to quell the riots and punish the offenders. But a government obliged constantly to mete out punishment for every little thing cannot be called a good government.
 If some work could be done in the riot-affected areas, things would settle down even in places where the situation is tense and people are fleeing in panic. Vitiated atmosphere implies that we have not done our duty well.
 It is a function of the Peace Committee to trace the offenders and inform the police. If some mischief-mongers have gone into hiding in some other places and are misleading the people  the members of the Peace Committee should also go and work there. I had heard that the [Hindu] Mahasabha President had been giving protection to Mathura Singh. The former is the Secretary to the Maharaja of Darbhanga and is a big shot in his own right. When he had come to me I had asked him if my information was correct. He told me it was not. Being President of the Mahasabha how could he do such a thing, he protested.
 Q. People come to us saying that a particular person under arrest is innocent and that we should have him released. What should we do in such matters ?
 A. If innocent persons happen to be arrested, you can arrange legal help for them.
 Q. How far can the Government help the Peace Committee in its work ?
 A. The Government can give financial help to the Peace Committee. But such help would be given not for everything but for what the Government considers proper. The Government’s resources are limited. If the Government is not discreet in disbursing help we have to bring it to their notice. But necessities have got to be provided by the Government and whatever they cannot provide, should be arranged for by the Peace Committee. This is a function of private charity. The Friends’ missionlibtech_843_footnotelibtech_844_footnoteis functioning along these lines. They are working in the places where the Government cannot reach. The work of the Friends’ mission can serve as a model for us. They have done a good deal of work in Midnapore and Noakhali. They had only  a few workers but they did a lot of work. Some Hindus and Muslims too had joined them. The Muslims were very few but they were remarkable workers. It is enough if you are sincere, and so many of you are honest workers ready to help the helpless.
 The Government will help as far as it can. It will certainly do so if you win its confidence. But it is not enough just to be Congressmen to deserve that confidence. Whatever the Government cannot provide will have to be met by collecting funds from private sources.
 Q. What should we say to those who seek our help for procuring rifles ?
 A. I am absolutely opposed to any demand for rifles. Even in Noakhali I was opposed to it. Wanting a rifle implies the desire to fight. Actually the police and the Government should function efficiently. I would even suggest that all nice and  decent  people should surrender their licences. People say that the Muslims are bringing in arms clandestinely. Quite possible; but they will not be able to keep them. Anyway, the Government should not supply arms.  I am absolutely firm about it. If the Government wants to do it, it should arm the whole nation and that cannot be done in a day. Our freedom would be meaningless if it cannot be preserved with non- violence.
 Maulana Minnat Allah Saheb asked whether or not Government should provide alternative accommodation to the people where there had been a heavy loss of life and property or where the Muslims were in a very small minority and still afraid to return to their homes on any account.
GANDHIJI: By all means, the Government should get houses built
 for them.
 The Maulana then asked if the people should be given rations till they found employment and if the Government should help them in finding employment.
 GANDHIJI: The Government should certainly help them. Those who have lost their means of livelihood like the loom, etc., should be provided these things so that they can stand on their own feet once again.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 April 29, 1947
 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 This is my last evening here. Tomorrow I shall have to go to Delhi. I beseech you not to come to the station to see me off. I do not like people shouting and making noise. My ears cannot stand noise. If there is no noise around I can even sit down to work as there is always a lot of work pending with me. But if a lot of people gather round and raise a din I cannot work. Nor can I rest when I want to. Two or three persons who would be escorting me would be enough. I grant that people come out of love. But forming such big crowds is no sign of true love. What is that love which makes a nuisance of itself ?
 Major General Shah Nawaz came to me today. He is working in Masaurhi. The Muslims who are going to settle down there are being looked after by him. The Government is no doubt doing all this work but help from those who can give it is also welcome. Shah Nawaz Saheb is doing this work very well. He talked to me about his work. I asked him to put down his points in writing. I shall give you the gist of what he has written down for me:
 A meeting was held at Atarpur at which a panchayat of the local Hindus and Muslims was formed. The head of the Panchayat came to Patna and exhorted the Muslim refugees to go back to their homes. He told them that they should regard him as their friend as before and trust him. He assured them that he would protect them at the cost of his life. His words had some effect and some fifty Muslim families returned to their villages. They are now living there is peace and they
 no longer require police protection. The Government also provides them food through General Shah Nawaz. When he distributed the foodstuffs to the Muslims, the Hindus protested. They said the  Muslims had suffered at their hands and so they would arrange for their food. And they have been doing it. The local Hindus are also helping the Muslims in harvesting their crops.
 Shah Nawaz Saheb also went to Bir. A Muslim from that place went up to him and said that he wanted to return to his village. But he saw danger in going three. The General permitted him to go and, providing him a police escort, asked him to proceed without fear. But as he was going a few Hindus of the village Panchayat stopped him and asked why he had the police escort with him. The Muslim villager was scared. He said he was frightened to go alone. The Hindus said it was a shame on them that he should go under police protection. They urged him to trust them and said that they would look after his safety and he should not have the police to escort him. The Muslim villager was persuaded at last. He realized that the Hindus were after all his friends and he sent back the escort.
 The third thing is that there are also some Sikhs working with Shah Nawaz Saheb who are discharging their responsibilities  very well. One among them is Lt. Kartar Singh. He carried the beddings of the returning Muslims to their respective houses. The Muslims appreciated this gesture. They thought they need not be afraid of men who had been offering such services to them. When somebody died in one of the Muslim families, Kartar Singh dug the grave all by himself. This has been very largely removing the fear from the hearts of the Muslims. And the work is proceeding well. But that does not mean that things are going on equally well in all places. If, in all the places where the Hindus have committed grave crimes, work is done along the lines followed in these three places, the Muslims would certainly return to their homes. There is no doubt about it. The Government would of course rebuild the houses that have been destroyed or damaged. But you too should help in putting up the houses again.
 All the houses should be ready by June. This is what Shah Nawaz Saheb also desires. Hence you must give your full help.
 If all the Hindus here start treating the Muslims in a friendly manner, the fire that is raging today would be extinguished. This fire should be put out at once. If no attempts are made to extinguish the fire at its source it would reduce everything to ashes. Bihar is a big
 province. If all is well here Calcutta and the other places which are going through fire will return to normal.
 I wish that when I return from Delhi your hearts would have changed so much that all the Hindus and Muslims of this place would be able to tell me that I need not stay here and that I could go back.

 APPENDICES
 APPENDIX I
 
  CLEMENT 	ATTLEE’S STATEMENTlibtech_845_footnote     February 	20, 1947 
  It 	has long 	been the policy 	of successive 	British Governments 	to work  towards 	the realization 	of self-government 	in India. 	In pursuance 	of this 	policy, an 	increasing measure 	of responsibility 	has been 	devolved on 	Indians, and 	today the 	civil administration and 	the Indian armed forces 	rely, to a very 	large extent, on Indian 	civilians and 	officers. In 	the constitutional 	field, the Acts of 	1919 and 1935 passed 	 by the 	British Parliament, each 	represented a 	substantial transfer of 	political power. 	In 1940, 	the Coalition 	Government recognized the 	principle that 	Indians should 	themselves frame a 	new constitution 	for a 	fully autonomous India 	and, in the 	offer of 	1942, they invited them 	to set 	up a Constituent 	Assembly for this 	purpose as soon 	as the 	war was over.  The 	declaration of the Prime Minister of 15th March last, which met with 	general approval in Parliament and the country, made it clear that 	it was for the Indian people themselves to choose their future 	status and constitution and that, in the opinion of His Majesty’s 	Government, the time had come for responsibility for the Government 	of India to pass into Indian hands. . . .  The Cabinet Mission	proposals, 	made public 	in May 	last, envisaged that  the 	future Constitution of 	India should be settled 	by a Constituent 	 Assembly composed 	in the 	manner suggested therein, 	of representatives 	of all 	communities and 	interests in 	British India and 	of the Indian States.  Since 	the return 	of the 	Mission, an 	Interim Government has 	been set 	up at the 	Centre.	In all 	the Provinces, Indian 	Governments, responsible to 	legislatures, are  in 	office. . . .  His 	Majesty’s Government 	are anxious 	to  hand 	over their 	responsibilities to  a 	government which, resting 	on the 	sure foundation of 	the support 	of the 	people, is 	capable of 	 maintaining peace 	and administering India 	with justice and 	efficiency.  It 	is therefore essential 	that all parties 	should sink their differences, in 	order that they 	may be 	ready to 	shoulder the 	great responsibilities 	which will come upon them 	next year. 	. . .  Cabinet 	Mission .  .  .  obtained 	.  .  .  the 	method by 	which  a 	 Constitution     here. 
 should be worked  out.  .  .  .  His  Majesty’s Government  there  agreed  to  re- commend to Parliament  a  constitution  worked  out  in  accordance  with  the proposals made therein by a  fully representative   Constituent   Assembly.   But  if it should appear that  such  a  constitution  will  not  have  been  worked  out  by  a fully representative Assembly, before the time mentioned in paragraph 7, His Majesty’s Government will have to consider to whom the powers of the Central Government in British India should be handed over, on the due date, whether as a whole to some form of Central Government for British India or, in some areas, to the existing Provincial Governments, or in such other way as may seem most reasonable and in the best interests of the Indian people.
 Although the final transfer of authority may not take place until June 1948, preparatory measures must be put in hand in advance. It is important that the efficiency of the civil administration should be maintained and that the defence of India should be fully provided for. But, inevitably, as the process of transfer proceeds, it will become progressively more difficult to carry out, to the letter, all the provisions of the Government of India Act of 1935. Legislation will be introduced in due course to give effect to the final transfer of power.
 In regard to the Indian States, as was explicitly stated by the Cabinet Mission, His Majesty’s Government do not intend to hand over their powers and obligations under Paramountcy to any government of British India. It is not intended to bring Paramountcy, as a system, to a conclusion earlier than the date of the final transfer of power, but it is contemplated that for the intervening period, the relations of the Crown with individual States may be adusted by agreement.
 His Majesty’s Government will negotiate agreements in regard to matters arising out of the transfer of power with representatives of those to whom they propose to transfer power.
 His Majesty’s Government believe that British commercial and industrial interests in India can look forward to a fair for field their enterprise under the new conditions. The commercial connection between India and the United Kingdom has been long and friendly and will continue to be to their mutual advantage.
 His Majesty’s Government cannot conclude this  statement without expressing, on behalf of the people of this country, their goodwill and good wishes towards the people of India as they go forward to this final stage in their achievement of self-government. It will be the wish of everyone in these islands that, notwithstanding constitutional changes, the association of the British and Indian peoples should not be brought to an end; and they will wish to continue to do all that  is in their power to further the well-being of India.

 . . .  These matters are, I find, beyond my depth.  Moreover I have enough to do  to keep myself morally straight to sit in judgement on others and specially those who are morally and spiritually miles ahead of me. I can only say that I have the fullest faith in you.  No sinful man can go about his business the way you are doing. Even if   I had a lurking suspicion, I would rather distrust my eyes and ears than distrust you. . .
 .
 Sometimes I thought that . . . you may be employing human beings as means rather than as ends in themselves. But then I take consolation in the thought that that consideration cannot be absent from your mind and that if you are sure of yourself, no harm can come to them. Then knowing you to be a great student of the Gita I have wondered if you are not doing violence to the principle of lokasangraha (conservation of social good), wisely propounded therein. But this consideration, too, I am sure, must not be absent from your calculations, in this experiment of yours. I know your attitude to woman is the only right attitude as you are one of
 those who consider her an end in herself and not merely as a means. You have never exploited her.

                     DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX III  LETTER FROM SIR 	HUGH DOWlibtech_847_footnote        GOVERNOR’S 	 CAMP,  BIHAR,  March 	17, 1947 
  Thank 	you for your letter of 	today’s date. 	I have 	always held 	that no public 	man can hope to reform 	other people and make them better unless he searches his own 	heart and devotes 	his first attention 	to trying 	to become 	a better 	man himself. 	I do 	not know 	why you should 	have been so surprised 	at this 	view being held by what 	you call 	a bureaucrat: 	it is probably 	not rarer 	among them than among other loosely 	labelled classes.   
   here.     
 I do not wonder that my Ministers reacted strongly to your summary of our conversation. May I put your points a little more fully:
  From 	the beginning 	of the 	riots I 	thought my 	Ministers should 	have at once 	declared their intention 	to compensate 	those who 	had suffered damage in them. Had it been done immediately, I think a 	good deal of the 	organized hostility 	against the 	Ministry’s measures 	would not  have 	arisen. At 	it was, it was only after 	considerable delay 	 that  an 	announcement was made. 
 The Prime Minister is well aware of my views about this. On my part, I quite realized the difficulties he felt about making a commitment of unknown financial liability.
  I 	think it 	is true that some 	officials drew 	from this the inference 	that the 	Ministry did 	not regard the 	matter as 	urgent. When I 	visited Chapra in 	the middle 	of January, 	no money 	or materials 	had actually 	been distributed, 	although the riots had 	taken place at the 	end of October, 	and the debris 	was just 	as the rioters 	had left it. 
 I told the Prime Minister my impressions on my return, and I am glad to say that he took the necessary steps at once by impressing on district officers that rehabilitation was the most urgent work before them.  I believe the Prime Minister has always realized this, and I certainly did not intend to convey to you, that the Ministry themselves were in any way half-hearted about it. But for some months, in my opinion, this view was held by many subordinate officials, because of the original delay in getting off the mark.
  I 	have no 	recollection of 	having touched at 	all on 	the topic 	of punishment 	of the 	guilty. Perhaps, as 	you have been seeing 	so many 	people in 	rapid succession, 	you have 	attributed to 	me views given 	by some of your 	visitors. 
 Actually, my views on this are rather the reverse of those suggested.  I do not think it is going to be possible to punish, judicially, any but a tiny fraction of the culprits, and that a lot of time of police and magistrates, that might be better spent, is likely to be entirely wasted in the attempt. In my opinion, the only effective way in which this matter could have been effectively dealt with was by the imposition of collective fines.
  I 	do not 	think the 	Ministry has 	turned down 	League demands merely 	because they were League 	demands. But I think the Hindu public of Bihar was, and perhaps 	is, averse 	from treating Muslim 	refugees more 	generously than they think Hindu refugees are treated in Bengal, and in 
 the beginning there was a tendency to wait and see.
 I think we have been unwise in taking a hostile attitude to “pockets”. What we should have done was to have been prepared to consider such proposals on their merits, and to place on the Muslims themselves the responsibility for suggesting definite schemes and carrying them out if they were sanctioned. I have discussed this with the Prime Minister who is aware of my views and I think not hostile to them. When we have paid compensation to a sufferer, it should be left to him to decide where and how he will spend it, just as it would be if he had drawn his compensation from an insurance company.
 As regards the question of minorities in general, differences between me and my Ministers have never, I think, gone to a stage when they were not resolved by friendly discussions. In this particular matter of the recent disturbances, I have never had occasion to think of exercising any special powers in opposition to ministerial advice. The question of restoring confidence between the two great communities is one of extraordinary difficulty, and I should not like you to get the impression that there has been any lack of co-operation between me and the Ministers on this subject.
 As regards the mica industry, I will send you a note as soon as I can prepare it. But my personal concern in this is not about the condition of the working men in the industry, about which I know little, but about the way in which child labour is exploited.

  APPENDIX IV  K. 		BOSE’S LETTER TO 		KEDAR NATH AND OTHERS         PATNA 
   MY 	DEAR . . .,  March 	16, 1947 
  . 	. . Swami Anand asked me 	this morning 	if he could 	say to 	his friends 	that I 	disapproved of 	Gandhiji’s action. It 	is with reference to 	this question that I 	should try 	to make 	my position 	clear. Hence this letter.  . 	. . From a 	serious study of 	Gandhiji’s writings I 	had formed 	the opinion, 	which was 	perhaps not 	unjustified, that he 	represented a 	hard, puritanic form of 	self- discipline, 	something which we 	usually associate with 	mediaeval Christian 	ascetics of 	Jain recluses. 
 So, when I first learnt in detail about Gandhiji’s prayog or experiment, I felt genuinely surprised. I was informed that he sometimes asked women to share his bed and even the cover which he used, and then tried to ascertain if even the least trace of sensual feeling had been evoked in himself or his companion. . . .
 But when I learnt about this technique of self-examination employed by Gandhiji, I felt that I had discovered the reason why some regarded Gandhiji as their private possession; this feeling often leading them to a kind of emotional unbalance. The behaviour of A, B or C, for instance, is no proof of healthy psychological relationship. Whatever may be the value of the prayog in Gandhiji’s own case it does leave a mark of injury on the personality of others who are not of the same moral stature as he himself is, and for whom sharing in Gandhiji’s experiment is no spiritual necessity.
 This has been the reason why I have sometimes spoken or written strongly to Gandhiji on the subject of repression and its effects upon those who come under his influence either in private or in public life. But, you will see, this charge is quite different from the one to which you or your friends subscribe. This is also the reason why I have drawn a distinction in the case of Manu, whose relation to Gandhiji is of a completely different order.
 I hope my position is quite clear. But if it is not, please do not hesitate to
  write.       Post-script    Yours 	sincerely,  NIRMAL 	KUMAR 	BOSE 
  Even 	with regard to the ‘experiment’, I would stand by Gandhiji, if—   the 		other party were 		a willing agent, 		voluntarily entering into 		the experiment 		with a knowledge 		of the 		possible consequences 		upon her own 		personality;  and 		the public knew about 		the experiment 		and expressed 		their mind over it.   The 	second is 	otherwise unnecessary, 	but has only 	been called for because 	Gandhiji himself invited 	public opinion on this 	subject twice in 	his prayer 	speeches in 	Noakhali. He 	expected the 	public to 	express an 	opinion even 	when they did not know 	the entire details of 	the situation. 	But, even if 	after knowing 	everything, the public 	thought that Gandhiji was 	in the 	wrong, while he 	considered himself 	to be 	right, I 	would stand by him.

 MASAURHI,
 March 18, 1947
  After 	receiving your letter written yesterday in the train, I had about an 	hour’s talk 	with you in 	which I 	tried to 	refute the 	charge against me 	that I 	had formed 	judgement hastily 	without giving A or 	others any 	chance of 	presenting their 	case fully. 	. . .  Personally, 	I have practised the Freudian technique of dream analysis on myself 	and have derived immense benefit, as it has helped to bring to the 	surface submerged desires which had been causing trouble, and thus 	helped me to deal with them satisfactorily. . . .  Bapuji, 	you originally 	called me 	to service under 	you while you were in Bengal. 	The University 	gladly granted me 	indefinite leave so 	long as 	you needed 	my services. 	But the interest 	of my students 	has also 	been suffering. When 	I have 	to choose 	between the amount of service I can render to you here in Bihar and 	for science  in the 	University, I 	would place the 	latter first. But 	if it had 	been in 	Bengal, I 	would have 	sacrificed the 	latter interest, 	because I would 	then have known that so 	far as 	translating your speeches 	into Bengali was 	concerned, I 	would have been more 	useful than 	most of your 	other assistants. 	But now that 	you are in Bihar, 	men like 	 Pyarelalji or 	others would be 	in their elements with 	their mastery over Hindustani and 	their undoubtedly great 	ability for secretarial 	work. So I would 	love to make 	room for anyone 	whom you may choose.  When 	once more you are in Bengal and feel the need of my services, the 	University will gladly grant me leave for service under you without 	hesitation.  Hence 	my plan is to leave for Calcutta even tonight if you do not object.  Yours 	affectionately,  N. K. B.   My 	Days with Gandhi, pp. 	178-81             here.

 CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE’S RESOLUTION ON THE PUNJABlibtech_849_footnote
 During the past seven months India has witnessed many horrors and tragedies which have been enacted in the attempt to gain political ends by brutal violence, murder and coercion. These attempts have failed, as all such attempts must fail, and have only led to greater violence and carnage.
 The Punjab, which had thus far escaped this contagion, became six weeks ago the scene of an agitation, supported by some people in high authority, to coerce and break a popular ministry which could not be attacked by constitutional methods. A measure of success attended this, and an attempt was made to form a ministry dominated by the group that had led the agitation. This was bitterly resented and has resulted in increased and wide-spread violence. There has been an orgy of murder and arson and Amritsar and Multan have been scenes of horror and devastation.
 These tragic events have demonstrated that there can be no settlement of the problem in the Punjab by violence and coercion, and that no arrangement based on coercion can last. Therefore, it is necessary to find a way out which involves the least amount of compulsion. This would necessitate a division of the Punjab into two provinces, so that the predominantly Muslim part may be separated from the predominantly non-Muslim part.
 The Working Committee commend this solution, which should work to the advantage of all the communities concerned, and lessen friction  and  fear  and suspicion of each other. The Committee earnestly appeal to the people of the Punjab  to put an end to the killing and brutality that are going on, and to face the tragic situation, determined to find a solution which does not involve compulsion of any major group and which will effectively remove the causes of friction.

 APPENDIX VII
 INTERVIEW WITH LORD MOUNTBATTENlibtech_850_footnote
 Top Secret	April 1, 1947
 Mr. Gandhi . . . gave me his views on the origin of Hindu-Muslim animosity, and though he did not hold the British responsible for its origin, he said their policy of “Divide and Rule” had kept the tension very much alive, and that I should now reap what my predecessors had deliberately sown.
 He urged me whatever happened to have the courage to see the truth and act by  it, even though the correct solution might mean grievous loss of life on our departure on an unprecedented scale.
 Finally, he gave me the first brief summary of the solution which he wishes me to adopt:
 Mr. Jinnah should forthwith be invited to form the Central Interim Government with members of the Muslim League. This Government to operate under the Viceroy in the way the present Interim Government is operating.
 Any difficulty experienced through Congress having a majority in the Assembly to be overcome by their able advocacy of the measures they wished to introduce.
 I need not say that this solution coming at this time staggered me. I asked “What would Mr. Jinnah say to such a proposal?” The reply was, “If you tell him I am the author he will reply ‘Wily Gandhi’.” I then remarked, “And I presume Mr. Jinnah will be right?” To which he replied with great fervour, “No, I am entirely sincere in my suggestion.”
 At this moment the A. D. C. reported that the Tibetan Mission had arrived, and our conversation therefore had to be terminated until the following day.
 I  did  however  obtain  Mr.  Gandhi’s  permission  to  discuss   the   matter   with Pandit Nehru and Maulana Azad, in strict confidence, the next time they came to see me.
 ADDENDUM:
 During  the  course  of  the  discussion  Mr.  Gandhi  gave  it  as  his  consi- dered  opinion  as  a  student  of  history  and   of   world   politics   that   never   before,  in  any  case  of  history  he   had   read   about   in   recent   or   past   times, had so difficult  or  responsible  a  task  been  imposed  on  any  one  man  as  that which now faced me.   I  thanked him sincerely for realising the position in  which I was placed.

 APPENDIX VIII
 INTERVIEW WITH LORD MOUNTBATTENlibtech_851_footnote
 Top Secret	April 2, 1947
 The meeting lasted from 2.30 p. m. to 4.30 p. m.
 To begin with we discussed the question of holding enquiries in Bihar and Bengal. I told him the views of the Governor of Bihar, of Sardar Patel and of myself, that enquiries were a waste of time and money, as well as a potential source of further communal strife.
 He flatly disagreed, and said that it was, in his opinion, essential that the Congress Government in Bihar should in all events show good faith by holding an enquiry which would reveal the appalling excesses committed by the Hindus in Bihar. We both agreed, however, that this was really a matter for the Provincial Government to settle, and I suggested that he should discuss the matter in the
 meanwhile with the Home Member, Sardar Patel.
 After this Mr. Gandhi came down firmly for his great plan, which he had revealed to me originally on Tuesday. I will repeat it here in greater detail.
 He wants me to invite Mr. Jinnah to form a new Central Government for India, which will be the Government to which I am to turn over power. He suggests I should leave it to Mr. Jinnah to select the Ministers, if necessary entirely from the Muslim League, but if he feels so inclined he can of course then make it a coalition  Government by including Nehru and other Congress Ministers as well as representatives of Minorities. In fact he suggests that Jinnah would be well advised to try and get the highest class team together and one likely to enjoy the greatest confidence of the Assembly.
 He assured me that the Muslim League had many men of greater calibre than, for example, Nishtar and Ghazanafar Ali Khan.
 The  essence  of  the  scheme  was  that   it   should   be   put   through   quickly in order that I  might  have  as  many  months  as  possible  as  Viceroy  and  Pre- sident of the Cabinet, and, by retaining the right of veto, continue to exercise complete control in  the interests of  fair play. The  fact  that   I  should   be   there to see  fair  play  for  the  first  few  months  would  ensure  Mr.  Jinnah’s  Govern-  ment not doing anything foolish which would prejudice its reputation in  the Assembly or in the country; and he felt that I could guide them along in a manner which would ensure their continuing along the straight and narrow path after I left in
 
 June 1948.
 If Mr. Jinnah refused this offer, then, Mr. Gandhi pointed out, the offer would have to be made to the only other great party in India—Congress. He hoped that Congress would invite Ministers from all shades of opinion including the Muslim League to participate in a Coalition Government.
 I twitted him that he really desired me to form a Central Government run by Congress, to whom I would turn over power, and that the preliminary offer to Jinnah was merely a manoeuvre.
 He assured me with burning sincerity that this was so far from being the case that he then and there volunteered to place his whole services at my disposal in trying to get the Jinnah Government through, first by exercising his influence with the Congress to accept it, and secondly by touring the length and breadth of the country getting all the peoples of India to accept the decision. He convinced me of his sincerity, and I told him so.
 He agreed that I should discuss this plan with Maulana Azad and Nehru.   Finally, he said that he proposed also to discuss it with those two and  with
 Mr.  Kripalani.	He  agreed  as   to   the   supreme   importance  of   complete secrecy,
 particularly as far as the Press were concerned.
 He asked if he might quote me as being in favour of this plan, to which I replied that the most he could say was that I was very interested by it, but that I would require an assurance from some of the other leaders that they considered it capable of being implemented before I would commit myself to its support.
 We discussed alternatives, and I told him I favoured the Cabinet Mission plan most of all, and he replied that he too would be in favour of it if it could be revised.
 Finally I discussed the possibility of turning over power to the areas of India in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the residents in those areas. Broadly speaking this would make a Hindu India with a Congress Government in Delhi, a truncated Pakistan, and the large states like Mysore, Travancore, Hyderabad, Kashmir, and groups of States, each having separate power turned over to them, owing allegiance to a Central authority for Defence, External Affairs, Communications, and possibly food.
 He agreed that whatever the decision, it should be taken soon and implemented as early as possible, and that meanwhile it would be an excellent thing if I remained in charge of the Central Government with the power of veto until June 1948.

 APPENDIX IX
 
 INTERVIEW WITH LORD MOUNTBATTENlibtech_852_footnote
 Top Secret	April 3, 1947
 The meeting lasted from 2.30 p. m. to 4.30 p. m.
 We continued our talks on Mr. Gandhi’s great scheme for the All-India Jinnah Government. He informed me that those of the leaders of the Congress he had spoken to had all agreed that it was feasible and would support him, but that he had not yet had time to talk to Pandit Nehru, which he intended to do that evening.
 He was more than ever intense about his scheme as being the best solution. But he agreed that if I was unable to decide on that solution, he would support me in any other solution which I could put before him as being in the best interests of the Indian people.
 He agreed that if the Muslim League were completely intransigent, partition might have to come, though he was most anxious to retain as strong a Centre as possible in this case.
 He agreed that an early decision was vital to end communal conflict and to give time to implement the decision. And finally he reiterated his desire that whatever happened I should retain firm charge at the Centre till June 1948 at the very earliest, in order to act as an umpire and exercise a guiding hand during the early stages of self- government.
 He said that his great friend Badshah Khan was staying with him. I had never heard the name and asked him to elucidate. He referred to him as the Frontier Gandhi, and I then recognized him to be the same person as I knew under the name of abdul Ghaffar Khan, brother of Dr. Khan Sahib the Premier of the Congress-Muslim Government in the N. W. F. P.
 Mr. Gandhi said that Abdul Ghaffar Khan had informed him that the Governor, Sir Olaf Caroe, had demanded the resignation of his brother, Dr. Khan Sahib and had shown himself to be very partial towards the Muslim League and to influence the British officials in that Province accordingly.
 In view of the fact that Lord Ismay had just returned from a visit to the N. W. F.
 P. I sent for him, and Mr. Gandhi repeated his allegation.
 Lord Ismay explained the position as he saw it, and pointed out that there must have been misunderstanding.
 I invited Mr. Gandhi to bring Abdul Ghaffar Khan at 2.30 the following day to meet Lord Ismay and myself.

 INTERVIEW WITH LORD MOUNTBATTENlibtech_853_footnote
 Top Secret	April 4, 1947
 The meeting lasted from 2.30 p. m. to 4.30 p. m.
 Mr. Gandhi brought with him as promised Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Lord Ismay attended the meeting.
 Abdul Ghaffar Khan gave a very forthright denunciation of the Governor of the
 N. W. F. P. and all his officials, particularly the political officers dealing with the tribes. . . .
 I asked Mr. Gandhi for his views. He said he feared that there were many British members of the I. C. S., particularly among the highly placed ones, who cold not bear to see the British leave India, and  who had clung all along to the theory that if they could only support the Muslim League actively, to the point at which it could be held that the British could not leave India to civil war, then the British would be compelled to stay.
 He pointed out that the views held by Mr. Winston Churchill were so well known that had he been in power or had there been any chance of his returning to power, the line taken by all those I. C. S. officials would have achieved its object. . .
 .
 I asked Mr. Gandhi for some more examples of biassed officials. He said that although he did not know Sir Francis Mudie personally, all his friends in Sind told him that he was extremely pro-Muslim League and much too friendly with his Government.
 I pointed out that he had previously agreed with Abdul Ghaffar Khan that Sir Olaf Caroe was insufficiently friendly with his Congress Government in the N. W. F. P., and now he accused Sir Francis Mudie of being too friendly with the Muslim League Government in Sind.
 Mr. Gandhi replied that he did not wish Governors to be biassed one way    or the other; their friendliness with their Government should be the impartial friendliness which a constitutional monarch should bestow upon any government which came to power.
 He advised me most strongly to get rid of any officials who could not be brought to see that they must remain impartial and helpful during the final stages.
 After  this  Mr.  Gandhi  spoke  about  the   Princes.   He   said   that   the Princes were really the creation of the British; that many of them had
 
 
 been gradually created up from small chieftains to the position they now held, because the British realized that they would become strong allies of the British under the system of paramountcy
 In fact he maintained that the British had, from the imperialistic point of view, acted very correctly in backing the Princes and the Muslim League, since between these two, had we played our cards really well, we could have claimed it was impossible for us even to leave India. He appreciated that my task was rendered all  the more difficult by the line taken by my predecessors.
 He considered it wicked of Sir Stafford Cripps not to have recommended the turning over of paramountcy to the Central Government representing the sovereignty of the Indian nation.
 I replied that although I could see the argument for turning over paramountcy to a really strong Central Government representing the whole of the Indian nation, I had not yet seen any workable scheme for producing a really strong Central Government, and in fact the chances of there being anybody to whom paramountcy could be turned over seemed to me to be remote.
 Only one scheme would achieve this, and that was the famous Gandhi scheme. I therefore asked him to explain this once more for Lord Ismay’s benefit. On conclusion I asked Abdul Ghaffar Khan if he really thought that Congress would accept this scheme, and that it would be workable. To this he gave a very definitely affirmative reply.
 I then invited Lord Ismay to take Mr. Gandhi to his room and put his scheme in writing.

LETTER FROM LORD ISMAYlibtech_854_footnote
 
Personal	THE  VICEROY’S HOUSE,
 NEW  DELHI,
 April 6, 1947
 DEAR MR. GANDHI,
 Thank you for your letter of 5th April. It was very kind of you to dictate it at such a late hour in order that it might reach me last night.
 I  think  that  there  has  been  some  misunderstanding   about   the   form   of  the short note which I prepared last Friday. As I understood it, Lord Mountbatten, on the conclusion of his talk with you, asked if you would be so
 
 good  as  to  spare  a  little  more  time  for  a  talk with  me  about  your   plan,   in order that I might prepare a short note summarizing its salient features in general terms. He had no intention, so far as I know, that I should attempt anything formal or elaborate. I have now shown him your letter and he confirms that my interpretation  of his wishes was correct.
 I have prepared a revised copy of my note substituting your version of point 7 for the original and including your point 8. This covers much the same ground as my original points 3 and 4, which therefore now become redundant.
 Lord Mountbatten has asked me to say that he much looks forward to having another talk with you about your plan before you leave.
 May I conclude with an expression of my personal thanks for having spared me so much of your time last Friday.

          DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  THE 	 VICEROY’S HOUSE,  NEW 	 DELHI,  April 	7, 1947 
  Ismay 	has shown me your letter to him of 6th April, and we both are most 	upset to think that any act, or omission, on our part should in any 	way increase the great burden you are bearing. I therefore think it 	right to send you the following personal explanation.  As 	we were parting 	last Friday 	afternoon, I 	said that your plan had 	many attractions 	for me 	and I 	asked you 	if you 	would be 	so good as 	to explain it 	to Ismay, who 	had not been present when 	you first 	propounded it. On 	your agreeing to 	do so, I 	asked Ismay to 	make a 	note of 	its salient 	features, and I 	authorized him 	to talk 	it over in 	confidence with 	the Reforms Commissioner. 	I am 	extremely sorry 	if by these 	observations I gave you 	the impression that I wished your plan reduced to the terms of 	formal agreement.    
 As  I  explained  to  you   during   the   many   talks   that   we  have   enjoyed, my  aim  has  been  and  is   to   keep   a   perfectly   open   mind   until   I   have   had the advantages of discussions with important Indian political leaders with the object of seeking an agreement between all parties, so that peace can be restored in the country and an acceptable basis for the transfer of power be worked out. When these preliminary conversations have been completed, I shall then have to make up my mind as to what I am going to recommend to His Majesty’s Government and, before I do so, I shall most certainly take advantage of your kind offer of further discussion with you.

GANDHI,  Many 	thanks for your 	letter of today. 	I find 	it difficult 	to advise 	you. Though the root 	causes of the 	disturbances in the Punjab still 	exist there 	has  been  a considerable 	measure of success 	in dealing 	with immediate disturbances, and 	I doubt 	whether you ought 	to exhaust 	yourself by undertaking 	any tour in 	the Punjab 	at this 	time of 	the year.  I 	quite agree that 	those outbreaks of 	violence are 	not a mere 	detail. What 	we have 	to secure 	is a 	settlement between 	the parties 	at the 	centre and, if 	possible, a 	combined front against 	violence. It is the 	effort to 	find a 	solution which will 	occupy all 	my efforts in 	the near future, and 	I know I 	can rely on 	help from you 	wherever you 	may be.  I 	enjoyed meeting you 	so much 	and found 	all you had to 	say of 	the greatest 	interest.

INTERVIEW WITH LORD MOUNTBATTENlibtech_857_footnote
 Top Secret	April 12, 1947
 The meeting lasted from 11.45 a. m. to 1.45 p. m.
 I thanked him for the letter he had sent me the previous day saying that he had been unable to get his great plan for a Jinnah government through responsible members of Congress, and had therefore had to withdraw it. He regretted his failure very much, but said he thought I could still go ahead on the plan myself if I ardently believed in it.
 I told  him  that  however  much  I  believed  in  it  I  couldn’t  possibly  go ahead with success in a matter in which he had already failed himself with the Congress.
 I then told him I wanted to report to him in strict confidence all my conversations with Mr. Jinnah, to put him in the picture.
 I then said that although my mind was still open I was now particularly studying two alternative solutions:
 (a) the Cabinet Mission plan; (b) a truncated Pakistan. I asked him how much he personally favoured a united India, and of course he said he was extremely anxious for  it. I asked him how far he thought Congress would go towards accepting the Cabinet Mission plan and warned him that Mr. Jinnah was bitterly opposed to the Cabinet Mission plan and therefore Congress would have to go at least as far as Mr. Jinnah wanted before he would even consider it.
 Mr. Gandhi said that the whole bone of contention was the interpretation   of the meaning of  the  Cabinet Mission plan, and  he  suggested that I  should call in the High Court to interpret it. I told him that the differences of opinion had already been resolved by the statement of the Cabinet of the 6th December;  but    he held that the people who drafted the statement were not the people who had to interpret it, and gave as an analogy Acts of Parliament. He said that if a difference of opinion arose as to the meaning of a particular clause in law, it was the judge who settled the meaning and who interpreted the law and not the people who  framed  the law. He seemed convinced that the Congress would accept any interpretation the High Court gave.
 I told him I did not see how we could possibly have  a  different  inter-  pretation put on the meaning of the  Cabinet  Mission  plan  to  that  which  the Cabinet Mission themselves had announced on December the 6th after
 taking legal advice.
 I then discussed the joint statement calling for a truce and a denunciation of the use of force to obtain political ends. He said he would gladly sign the statement shown to him or any similar statement if Mr. Jinnah and I wished him to do so; though he must point out that the statement, to have any value, should be signed by Mr. Kripalani on behalf of the Congress as a whole.
 He said he had told Pandit Nehru that if indeed I could get Mr. Jinnah to sign and abide by this statement, I should have taken the greatest step politically in the recent history of India, and one which he hoped he had been instrumental in putting into my head.
 Although I have absolutely no recollection of Mr. Gandhi making any such suggestion, I felt it would be politic not to point this out.  For although I believed it  to have been my own idea, I am only too delighted that he should take the credit.
 In the meanwhile Lord Ismay came down at my request with the Cabinet Mission plan and the Statement of December the 6th. Mr. Gandhi appeared never to have read this statement although he knew of its existence. He thought he was at Noakhali at the time and did not have time to read it. After reading it very carefully he came back to his original point of view that the Cabinet Mission statement should be submitted to the High Court for interpretation, and he felt sure the Congress would abide by their decision.
 Lord Ismay pointed out that it was less a matter of finding out what the actual legal interpretation was than of ascertaining what common interpretation would be acceptable both to the Muslim League and the Congress; and to this Mr. Gandhi unreservedly agreed.
 Meanwhile he called upon me to renounce the use of the British Army, and said that he included the British officers of the Indian Army in that term; in other words any of the armed forces under my orders.
 I pointed out that except for the Punjab, which is under a Section 93 Government, in all other provinces it was the local Government that called out the troops, and that if he wanted that practice to stop why didn’t he make a start by talking to the Congress Government in Bihar where he was off to that evening. He said sadly he had already spoken to them, and that if they had had a strong conviction of non-violence they would offer themselves as sacrifices rather than allow these massacres to continue of trying to stop them by the use of troops
 I did not altogether follow his argument here, and may have misquoted him.
 But since it appeared to be purely academic, and a matter he was going to put before the local Congress Government in Bihar, I did not pursue it.
 He then said that he advised me to go on strengthening the Interim Government, and  making  them  function  correctly   for   the   next   14   months; after which he considered I should hand over power to the Interim Government. This
 staggered Lord Ismay and myself, and we both pointed out that that meant handing over power to one party, namely Congress, to the grave disadvantage of the other party, the Muslim League, which would not fail to produce strife, possibly leading to civil war.
 Mr. Gandhi, with a wily smile, pointed out that if Mr. Jinnah indeed signed the paper we were sending round to him he could not again use force for political purposes.
 I must say I was speechless to find that he proposed, if Mr. Jinnah indeed meant to sign and stick to the statement, to take advantage of this to impose a Congress Government over the Muslims. Here again I find it hard to believe that I correctly understood Mr. Gandhi.
 Finally, after substituting the word “communities” instead of “peoples” and having the declaration of truce retyped, Mr. Gandhi appended his signature in all three scripts: English, Urdu and Gujarati; and Lord Ismay took the paper for Sir Eric Mieville to take round to Mr. Jinnah.
