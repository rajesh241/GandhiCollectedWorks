         MY 	DEAR IDIOT,   LETTER TO AMRIT KAUR     August 	28, 1941 
  	I see that I can keep you going even there. I passed on to you 	yesterday N[arendra] Dev’s case. Read the enclosed cuttinglibtech_37_footnote. See if you can do anything about it. Perhaps you are 	the best medium. Saruplibtech_38_footnoteis doing something. The Press reports are so hopelessly 	one-sided that it becomes difficult to know the truth.  	I wonder if my statement on the wretched Indo-Burman Agreementlibtech_39_footnoteis published in the papers you get. If you see Bajpai 	tell him I was deeply grieved to see him involved in the national 	dishonour.  I would like to know his defence if he has any. I have 	said the least about his part in the affair. Love. 
   [PS.]  BAPU   This was 	before the arrival of the post. There is no hurry about the 
  	apples. I have given the permission, acquired no right. Here is 	Shah’s letter.       
 You will do what you like. Perhaps it is better to let them fight out their own battle.
 Prabhakar had fever yesterday. Annapurna has been having slow
fever.
 Of course you are better in spelling as in many other things. You

 August 28, 1941
 BHAI NATVARLAL,
 I was surprised by your letter of the 25th. From an auditor you have become a plaintiff. Even if I have received complaints against you, surely I am not going to entertain them. So far as I am concerned, you are free, having submitted your report. Actually you have done us a favour by auditing the accounts. Why should you feel unhappy? You can make any marks you like on the papers with you. If you think fit you may hand them over to Bachhraj Co. Or if you wish they will deposit them with some lawyer. The Navajivan office will need the account books every now and then. I will certainly inquire into the charge you have levelled against them, but I must say that I have not agreed to inquire into their affairs, nor do I entertain any suspicion against them. I cannot readily believe that they have all conspired with Chandrashankar. Some of your remarks have appeared strange to me. But I do not blame you for them. You have stated what you honestly felt. I have now to sift the truth.

 CHI. HARSHADA,
 I have your letter and the ten-rupee note. The manner in which you are observing the rules is excellent. There is not only no need to send the yarn to me, but you need not send it to Kakubhai either. You can certainly buy it. It will, therefore, suffice if you send the amount which you think the yarn is worth.

  	I have your letter. I think the letter you wrote was not proper. 	And, moreover, where was the need to send it to the Trustees? You 	also were certainly at fault. Students should have nothing to do 	with the servants. What does it matter if they do not supply 	aniseed? And if you do, not get tea you should put up with that. Is 	this [habit of] quarrelling over trifles also what you learnt here? 	Anyway Mahadev has had to apologize on your behalf.  	And it is not proper, either, that you should lose heart about your 	studies. There is no slavery there. You are a slave only of your 	habit and your  anger.   You    should    get    over    these    	shortcomings.    If  you cannot do that, I can see that it will be 	difficult for you tocontinue there. You should regard yourself 	forbidden to have tea in Irani restaurants, for is it not the rule 	that you will get tea only once a day? Go to Mahadevbhai himself, 	understand from him what your dharma is and follow it.  From 	a photostat 	of the Gujarati: G.N. 	9382. Also 	C.W. 6657.  Courtesy: 	 Lilavati Asar

She will not go to 	Bombay. She will remain here somehow. You alone should give her the 	injections. If you insist, I shall arrange that she takes them now. 	You are coming here on the 13th, are you not ? There is information 	that Pyarelal will be released on Saturday. Kanu will be going to 	receive him. A.

 I 	am late replying to your letter. Sardar 	is free from the danger that was suspected. Of course he is 
 considerably reduced and has to be under observation.
 Kishorelal is living at the Ashram. He is as well as can  be  expected.

 Rajen Babu is still far from well. He is expected here in September.
 Yes, I did hear of the death of Dr. A. Das. I sent a note of condolencelibtech_42_footnote. He   was  truly  a  great  and  good  national  servant.  Such tragedies will occur, we have to bear them. There is little malariain the Ashram. But an indefinite and unclassified fever attacks the inmates now and then. Careful nursing brings it down.

But Gurudev lives on in a special sense. His activities were universal, mostly altruistic and through these he will be immortal. Santiniketan, Sriniketan and Visvabharati—all these are manifestations of one movement. They were his soul and for them Deenabandhu left this world followed by Gurudev. Our true homage should be to maintain these institutions which he is watching wherever he may be.

Annapurna’s fever is not going. Manu is giving her the medicine 	that was given to Rajkumari. Prabhakar is well. I had thought your 	suggestion about the diet was to be continued only up to the 13th, 	when you would be arriving. I shall carry on with what I am taking 	now and after your arrival on the 13th, shall make whatever changes 	you suggest. So far, 2 oz. of butter is having good effect. I am 	gradually increasing the milk quota. The bowel movement has 	considerably improved. The enclosed cartoons have been brought by 	Pyarelal. You will like them.

  FOREWORD TO “PRACTICAL NON-VIOLENCE” 
 It is simply a coincidence that these essays on “Practical Non-violence” are being published in pamphlet form almost simultaneously with Richard Gregg’s  A Discipline  for  Non-violencelibtech_44_footnote. The votary of non-violence should read the two together. Kishorelal Mashruwala is like R. Gregg a deep student of non-violence. Though he has been brought up in that faith, he never takes anything for granted. He believes only what he has tested. Thus he has come to accept non-violence by hard thinking. He has in his own life and practice proved its efficacy in a variety of conditions—political, economic, social and domestic. His essays have, therefore, a value all their own. They should help the believer in non-violence in sustaining his faith and the honest unbeliever in resolving his doubts.

 SEVAGRAM, August 31, 1941
 Practical Non-violence
 
  A DIFFICULT PROBLEM 
 A person who is scientifically inclined does not take the truth of anything for granted; he tries to prove it himself. In this way he develops his own intellect and also obtains knowledge of  the potentialities of things. Why does an apple fall off the tree, why does it not fly up? It is said that this question arose in Newton’s mind and he discovered the law of gravitation. Is the earth flat like a plate? Is it stationary? Such questions arose in Galileo’s mind and he discovered that the earth is spherical like an orange and revolves on its axis. Such discoveries have produced great results.
 A khadi worker should adopt a similar scientific attitude. Newton or Galileo did not ponder over the problem of Daridran-arayana and of serving Daridranarayana. They followed an intellectual quest. The khadi worker has however to find a solutionto the problem of feeding the hungry masses. That is why their attitude should be all the more scientific.
 Why khadi? Why not mill cloth? Also, why not foreign cloth? Why cotton cloth? Why not silk? Why not jute or woollen textiles? Why the charkha? Why not the takli? I can go on filling pages with questions
 
 like these but I do not propose to exhaust all the possible questions.
 I want to touch upon only one question here. Suppose for a moment that for one reason or the other India does not have or cannot run textile mills, also suppose that no cloth can be imported from  abroad, can we then provide sufficient khadi to all the Indians? We should not be satisfied with meeting the demand somehow. The East India Company did this and to some extent this was done even earlier. In those days people were forced to spin and to weave on minimum wages. This custom was called begar. We have to confess with regret that begar is an ancient custom. It was not introduced by the British. We may perhaps be able to produce enough khadi through begar. But khadi workers cannot be trained to undertake such inhuman work. Our intention is to help the spinners earn such wages as would ensure, after eight hours’ hard labour, wholesome and nutritious food, necessary clothing, comfortable houses and other amenities necessary for a happy home. If it is proved that khadi cannot succeed under these terms and conditions, we should modestly accept the limitations of khadi and also restrict our activity.
 Let me state my view here. I have adopted khadi in the belief that khadi has all the above-mentioned capacity. I cannot adduce irrefutable evidence in support of my view. Many of my activities are undertaken in good faith or intuitively. But they are not conducted on the basis of inspiration alone; I have tried to place my convictions on a sound scientific foundation while propagating them. I have made and am still making all possible experiments based on reason and I encourage my co-workers to do so. We have not found a solution to the problem posed above; we may perhaps never get it and I know it is a difficult problem, a complex problem. It does involve a lot of statistics as also knowledge of economics, psychology, particularly of the Indian mind, and also of ethics. A mere statistical solution will not do, nor will a mere economic solution, because we cannot ignore our most fundamental and vital principles. We do not want to spread khadi through coercion. We want to do our work by changing people’s sense of values and habits. Hence our researches should proceed from all angles.
 Khadi workers should intensify their efforts to solve this difficult problem.
 This is enough for the day. [From Hindi]

I am hopeful that I shall be able to convince Sardar on your 	behalf. Bring him out of bed first. With so many of you doctors 	there, why should he have to spend one hour in the lavatory? That is 	as good as inviting death.  	I suppose you know that Durga has not fully recovered. She gets 	belching and has pain in her leg. She is still in Ahmedabad. This is 	for your information if you do not know it. Mahadev 	will of course get well.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From a photostat of the Gujarati: C.W. 1057. Courtesy: Dr. Nathubhai Patel

  	I have your postcard and letter. Is it Mahadev who is blessed in 	having you as secretary or is it you who are blessed in being 	Mahadev’s 
 secretary ? Who can answer ? Since you have not come I keep  postponing revising your writing and attend to other things. You should not fall ill now. Why should I worry about Mahadevbhai ? Good doctors and you, too, are there. Now do not let him work so much.

  	There is no letter from you today. Pyarelal is not going today. Some 	work remains to be done. And he has promised to be present when 	Kolaya comes to consult Dr. Das. He is his jail companion. He will 	definitely start tomorrow (Tuesday). The telegram has been sent 	today.  	You must be knowing about Mahadev’s illness. If you do not you 	would do well to pay a visit there. Mary Barrlibtech_59_footnotehas arrived. She is also there.  	1 My 	weight was up by two lb. yesterday. It is now 1022 1bs. 	This  	is mainly the result of taking more butter. I am eating two oz.

  LETTER TO AMRIT KAUR

 MY DEAR IDIOT,
 I write this during the silent hour, i.e., before dinner and before the post.
 I have not heard from Agatha nor from Henrylibtech_77_footnote. But I saw H.’s article in a magazine which contained the attack. I thought I should correct him. If you want to see the article I can send it to you. And as I did not know H.’s address I wrote to Agatha.
 Of course you were right in refusing the Hyd. invitation as you would be in refusing every other. I sent it to you so that you may know it and send a reply. You were bound to refuse. Before you take up anything you must be thoroughly restored. Even as it is, you are giving  a good account of yourself.
 You remember the pamphlet containing the Lahore resolutionlibtech_78_footnoteon Pakistan! Two copies have been traced in the library.
 I never anticipate evil. So the answer to your question stands deferred till the .evil overtakes us but which shall not. Is that satisfactory answer, if it is any? Do you remember your question?
 For the time being you need do nothing about Narendra Dev. I shall inquire. I do not know anything about the Dehra Dun offer.
 Prabhavati wrote for the transfer of Jayaprakash on the ground of ill health, which is patent. Her application is summarily rejected. They can’t do anything because it is right. They yield only to pressure bordering on violence. We are on that portion of Ramayana which relates Narad’s confusion because he had to be corrected. Truly does God confound the wisdom of those whom He seeks to destroy. Here is a telegram about Ratlam. I have already written to you about the case.libtech_79_footnote

   INTERVIEW TO H. V. KAMATHlibtech_80_footnote      SEVAGRAM, 
  September 	5, 1941  Q. 	Has the entry of Russia into the war altered its complexion and 	India’s attitude thereto? A. 	The entry of Russia into the war has not materially altered the  	complexion of the war. Expression of oral sympathy with Russia as a 	victim of aggression is not wrong but no purpose will be served by 	so doing so long as we cannot translate it into action. Russia is 	not wholly free from blame inasmuch as she has allied herself with 	imperialist power though it may be for the purpose of self-existence 	only. Had Jawaharlalji, who is a close student of international 	politics, not been behind the bars and thus free to express his 	views, his opinion in the matter would have weighed with me.  Q. 	Can you, Mahatmaji, envisage the emergence of a non-violent new 	world order in the Atlantic Charter? A. 	No. I am not able to envisage in the Atlantic Charter the emergence 	of a non-violent new world order of my conception.  Q. 	What is your attitude towards the acceptance of office in the 	Viceroy’s Executive Council by Congressmen such as Sjt. Aneylibtech_81_footnoteand Mr. Nalini 	Ranjan Sircarlibtech_82_footnote? A. 	I do not approve of the acceptance of office by Congressmen  	such as Sri Aney and Nalini Babu. Such action on their part has 	undoubtedly given a handle to the British Government for carrying on 	propaganda in America to the effect that India should now be 	satisfied in that even well-known ex-Congressmen have joined the 	Viceroy’s Council.  Q. Is the satyagraha movement proceeding to your satisfaction? In what way is it          
 different from the 1930 movementlibtech_83_footnote? Has the policy of non-embarrassment any political value or significance? What will be your attitude in case the Government conceded the right of freedom of speech? Is there any likelihood of intensification of the struggle in the near future?
A.    The   satyagraha   movement   is   proceeding   to   my	entire
 satisfaction. Pressure on a scale comparable to that of the  1930 movement is not being put on the Government, it is true, but that movement was different in character from the present one. But the main fact that the struggle is going on constitutes sufficient moral pressure, so much so that the British Government’s position in America does not appear to be quite comfortable. The policy of non-embarrassment is a logical consequence of non-violence and in that way a political necessity, but I do not expect the British Government to reciprocate my chivalrous stand. There is no possibility of the Government conceding the right of freedom of speech, but if they did so honestly, I am bound to call off the movement. Bona-fide recognition of free non-violent speech would mean a large step towards independence. Intensification of the struggle is not likely during the pendency of the war. Intensification will come at the close of the war if it became necessary.
 Q What is your attitude to the local kisan and mazdoor struggles?
 A. I extend my sympathy to all local kisan and mazdoor struggles for their legitimate demands and such struggles cannot amount to embarrassment of the Government. My attitude cannot be otherwise, considering that I myself have been the author of such struggles in the past.
 Q. In view of the fact that the word ‘non-violence’ does not appear in the Congress Constitution, what is the duty of Congressmen as regards non-violent  conduct?
A. Though the word ‘non-violence’ does not appear in the
 Congress Constitution, it does in resolutions. Though there be no resolution of a plenary session of the Congress on the subject of non-violence, I expect Congressmen to abide by the A.I.C.C. resolution so long as it is not modified or altered by a plenary session.
 Q. Acharya Kripalani recently, in reply to Sardar Sardul Singh Caveeshar, said that the Forward Bloc is not a part of the Congress organization. The statementon Kripalaniji’s part has created not a little confusion and misunderstanding among several Congressmen. I personally hold that the position of the Forward Bloc in the Congress is quite similar to that of the Congress Socialist Party. Could you kindly
 
 enlighten me with your opinion on the subject?
 A. Though the Congress Constitution does not recognize separate groups within the Congress organization, Congressmen who owe allegiance to such groups have every right to remain in the Congress in their individual capacity if the groups are not inconsistent with the Congress resolution and policy. I never insisted that Congressmen who do not subscribe to my interpretation of non-violence should leave the Congress. The Congress Socialist Party is just as much not a part of the Congress organization as the Forward Bloc. The Congress Constitution makes no mention of either as being component parts of the Congress organization. The Forward Bloc and the Congress Socialist Party are on a par with each other so far as their being part of the Congress organization is concerned.
 Q. Have you, Mahatmaji, full faith in a Divine Power moulding our destiny?
 A. Yes, I have full faith in a Divine Power guiding the destinies of India and of the world. It is this living faith that sustains me in the present crisis.
 The Hindu, 5-11-1941
 
  LETTER TO SARANGADHAR DAS 
 SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,
 September 6, 1941
 DEAR SARANGADHAR DAS,
 Rajkumari is resting in Simla. She won’t be back before October.
Your letter to her gives a piteous tale.
 This is my advice. The men whose statements you have translated had no notion of the working of ahimsa. If they had the courage of non-violence they could not have come away alive except by converting their assailants miscalled Police without retaliation. That would mean ahimsa of the highest order. This does not come except by long previo- us training. It is rarely seen. But if one cannot exhibit such courage, one must not be a coward. One has not only the right but it is a duty to retaliate in a vigorous manner. This again requires great courage. I have, seen it exhibited successfully. It should not matter how heavy the odds are. Resistance may mean death. It must be faced in preference to a cowardly resignatio to brutal and indecent treatment.Iti this self-defence which is not taboo to a Congressman. It is the inherent right and the bounden duty of a man to defend honour non-violently if he knows how, otherwise violently. There is no other way. Such a man will soon
 be able to learn the virtue of non-violence. But that is only by the way. My advice is clear and emphatic. There is too much of this assaulting in Orissa, assuming the truth of statements that have been sent to me from time to time. If you have assimilated my advice you will act in a methodical and deliberate manner. You will be at liberty to publish this letter with a carefully thought out programme as to how to go about it. You may send me the draft manifesto for approval or you may come when you like for a discussion before acting. The matter is  too  important to be ignored.

  	I have your letter and the cheque through Prithvi Singh. Why is the 	cheque of the Travancore bank ? Does it give [a higher] interest or 	provide more facilities ? Where can that cheque be encashed ? It 	must be charging a handsome commission. I shall of course make 	inquiries.  	Can you accommodate both the sisters ? How is it your studies get 	constantly interrupted ? I shall not let you sit for the examination 	if you are not fully prepared. There should be no question which you 	cannot answer. If you cannot be so well prepared by April, then you 	may sit for the examination later. I am not in a hurry. The 	knowledge you have gained is not going to be wasted, and so, if it 	takes some more time, so be it. Because, I also do not wish that you 	should spoil your eyes and health by continuously reading night and 	day in order to pass. Passing in this way is no better than failing. 	You have to appear for the examination not for name but for service. How 	much khadi did you sell and where did you sell it ?  	The Ashram is now becoming very crowded. Vijaya and Vasumati have 	come. Pannalal has come. Some others will be arriving. More people 	are eager to come. How can I accommodate them ? Just think of the 	size of the kitchen and of the verandah, which is the dining place. 	Construction work is of course going on. There is nosaying when it 	will end. Nor can I fix a time for it. Let God do as He wills.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original : Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy : Dr. Sushila Nayyar

  LETTER TO BHAGWANJI P. PANDYA 
 September 8, 1941
 CHI. BHAGWANJI,
 I have your letter. I got Puratan’s also. He is displeased that you sent his five-year-old note without his consent. It is his opinion now, i.e., after five years’ experience, that Dada is a spotless and simple-hearted man. Bhai Puratan believes that the allegation against Dada is the result of a conspiracy by some Harijans. I share his belief. These people have suffered so much that they have lost their humanity. This is of course not true of all of them. We must bear with all this. But while doing so we should not be misled into entertaining suspicions against anybody.
 I understand Narahari’s criticism. It is a fact that  you  are collecting evidence. In doing so you cannot but start  whisperings among the people. This would foul the atmosphere. And, moreover, you are forgetting your sphere of work. This is bound to interfere with your work. Why do you make yourself a watchman of anyone in  the  Ashram? It will be enough if others, you and I, all become our own watchmen. Supervision is Narahari’s job. If anybody wants to complain let him do so to him. You should plug your ears. I have a beautiful figure of three monkeys, which I always keep in front of me. They are three representations of the same monkey. His ears, mouth and eyes are closed. The lesson the figure teaches is that one should not listen to criticism of or see or speak of anybody’s defects. The original of this figure is found on a tall pillar in Japan, and was carved thousands of years ago. We should engrave this lesson in our hearts.
 I will hear what you have to say when you come here. I am not inclined at present to send for anybody else. I would send for others
 
 
 only if I myself am shaken even a little in my mind. But if Narahari is positive in his view, I would not disregard him and make any inquiry. You may, with Narahari’s consent, stay for 15 days or more. But you need not come or stay specially for the sake of Nimu. She will get somebody to accompany her.

  LETTER TO SUSHILA NAYYAR 
 September 8, 1941
  	Again there is no letter from you today. But, considering your 	circumstances, I should not expect a letter from you daily.  	I have left it entirely to you to decide where Pyarelal has to be 	operated upon for his gland. You alone can say where it would be 	best to have it. Your convenience will no doubt be a factor to 	consider. You will get this on Tuesday. You must free yourself from 	there on Friday. I should not worry if you are required there for 	two or three days. But it is possible that the operation may not be 	over by that time and you may not be able to free yourself from 	there in time. The earliest it can be done in Delhi would be on the 	16th. Pyarelal can reach there on the 11th at the earliest. He will 	have to spend five days there. If it is necessary, he may as well 	spend those days with Mother. Now think about it yourself.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original : Pyarelal Papers.

   LETTER TO PYARELAL     SEVAGRAM, 
     CHI. 	PYARELAL,  September 	8, 1941 
  	I have  received  your  letter. I  do not think it advisable for you 	to have the operation in Wardha. If facilities are easily available 	in Bombay or Delhi, I see no need to have it done in Wardha. I would 	go by Sushila’s decision in this matter. If she  decides  in  	favour  of Bombay, it does not matter if she has to waste two or 	three days. But  she would probably prefer Delhi. She can give more 	personal  	attention there. In my opinion Sushila should reach Delhi by the 	15th.  I would consider unavoidable the time spent in undergoing the 	operation. One may take into consideration the effect it may have on 	others. But I would treat it as of very little importance. The main 	thing is the effect it may have on me and on you. I do not think it 	will make any difference in this regard. I would not like to detain 	you with me. I would also not like it if you stayed on there or in 	Delhi without any 
 valid reason. But so far, not a single day has passed like that. Hence, I am not anxious.

  LETTER TO KRISHNACHANDRA 
 September 8, 1941
 CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,
 If evil thoughts come to mind it means that the mind is empty and Nature abhors a vacuum. So when the mind is not reciting Ramanama or doing His work, then the Devil takes possession of it. So when evil thoughts invade the mind, the only way to check their attack is to recite Ramanama and to do Rama’s work. It can never fail. Go on increasing the recitation of Ramanama till you succeed. There is no other remedy.

  	I have read your long letter. I can understand your agony. But it 	will take you forward. If at first you had my support, you are not 	without it now. Is this not what many people believe?  	I want to drive out from your mind the idea that we absolutely 	cannot do without foreign help.libtech_119_footnoteThe examples of China, Russia and England cannot 	apply to us. China, after attaining freedom, seeks  outside help in 	order to fight Japan. Russia and England are already free. We may 	also seek help from a thousand quarters after we have become free, 	but only if we have gained our freedom with force of    
 arms. Freedom won through non-violent means will need no help, or it will need the entire world’s. All this is so clear that you should have no difficulty in understanding it. But if you do have any, please find some time to come over here at least to get your doubt resolved. This is a very important issue. In the context in which you made your statementlibtech_120_footnotelibtech_121_footnote, it does not at all seem proper. The fight about Pakistan is a fight between two brothers. One can get reconciled to one brother being- defeated at the hands of the other; but the one who wins with the help of a third party will himself become a slave and also make the other a slave. Whom are the British helping today? Where does Pakistan exist in the present situation? Akhanda Hindustanlibtech_122_footnotelibtech_123_footnote, on the other hand, does exist as a dream at any rate. He who seeks to realize that dream may be no more than a dust particle floating in the sky but after all it is floating. Its dream lifts it above; it does not cast it down. Its exercise of individual freedom makes it shine brightly in the sky. Whose help can it require? And if all the particles get together, that is, recognize their individuality, then they themselves will be the sky. Can you conceive a sky without particles? You, therefore, who are out to fight for  an  Akhanda Hindustan can never entertain the idea of seeking external help. It does you no credit. It ill becomes the maturity of your thinking. If I go on further I would be only wasting time. But what need to argue at length with the wise?

   INTERVIEW TO “THE HINDU”       WARDHAGANJ, 
  September 11, 1941 I interviewed Gandhiji today and asked him a few questions on Mr. Churchill’s  reference to India in his latest speechlibtech_126_footnotelibtech_127_footnotein the Commons. Gandhiji declined to answer any  question. 	Then I asked him; “I see you are disinclined to answer the most 	important and relevant 	questions that I put to 	you. Do 	you think that this 	silence of yours 	is helpful 	for the cause of Indian independence for which the Congress is fighting?” Gandhiji replied:  	If I did not believe so I would have come out with a statement 	without any prompting from you. But I sincerely believe that my 	silence is much more eloquent than any words that I may utter.  	After      
 all it is not words that matter. Action is all in all. My action is before all India and, if you like, the whole world.

  	Your left-handed letter! What a tragedy that you cannot use your 	right hand! I repeat my suggestion of yesterday. Go to Delhi or even 	come here for the cure. If you are not cured here you can be sent to 	Bombay. I am quite clear that Simla is not the place for you just 	now.  	In whatever you do, Shummy’s willing co-operation  must  be there. 	The cottage has become usable. The walls are being filled in. But it 	is quite habitable.  	M[ahadev] will be still away for some time. You will wire what you 	are doing. Love.

  	I had omitted to reply to one of your questions. Suddenly this 	morning I remembered it. 
 The movementlibtech_128_footnotestarted on 18th October. Jawaharlal was arrested on 31st October. I have no interest in celebrating days. Only a very significant day should be celebrated, so that it will have its impact. It has become cheap nowadays to celebrate various days. People’s response is also lukewarm. In this condition I don’t venture to call for celebrations. If you suggest a programme which may touch the hearts of crores of people, I will surely consent to it. Satyagraha day is different from the day of Jawaharlal’s arrest. Think for yourself and guide me. Discuss it with Mahadev and, if possible, with Sardar.

  LETTER TO G. D. BIRLA 
 September 12, 1941
 BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
 I got Hanumanprasadji’s letter through ‘M’ day  before yesterday.
 The incident is sad. I am clear in my mind that Raghavadas could be free of his weakness only by admitting fully the mistakes committed. Without such purification he is likely to do only harm. He is a good man; so without such admission the harm would be greater. One sign of goodness is owning a mistake openly. For a satyagrahi there is no other course. So the first thing to do is to find out some nice reliable person who would talk to him. I got the cutting you sent.

    BHAI 	SUBEDARlibtech_132_footnote,  September 	14, 1941 
  	I have your letter. I think you have again fallen into a trap. The 	Quaid-e-Azam has made no definite proposal. He only wants to prove 	the two-nation theory and partition the country. We need not pay 	attention to him, as we would not to anybody who wanted to separate 	two brothers.  	The charges against the Congress have been disproved, but if they 	have not they can be referred to an impartial tribunal.  	As long as the policy of keeping at a distance from both the 	Government and the Congress and using concessions by either side for 	extracting more from the other remains, no understanding seems 	possible. A party following such a policy will never be satisfied 	with what it gets.  	I am convinced that the riots in Sind, Dacca and Ahmedabad were 	intended to intimidate the Congress. But I am ready to ignore this. 	That is, all the points may be referred to an impartial tribunal. I 	don’t think anything else is possible.  	And please also remember that ultimately the people themselves will 	decide these questions and bypass us all. I would, therefore, advise 	you to extricate yourself from this business, or to proceed on the 	basis of certain fundamental principles. It will be enough if you 	cling to even one. As long as he does not decide about coming to an 	agreement among ourselves, no discussion is possible.

 I got your letter. You have not been forbidden [to use] khadi. They have only expressed their opinion. You have not been ordered to use drill cloth, but are given freedom to use it. I would, therefore, advise you to buy khadi costing the same as drill cloth and get uniforms made out of it. See that you get strong khadi. If you can win over the peons, there will be no difficulty. Do not force them. Do not inflict khadi on them as a compulsory duty, but create  love  of  khadi in them.  If  they spin, khadi may even be  cheaper.  Even  if  you are  put to  some expense, bear it and induce the peons to wear khadi uniforms
 
 willingly.
 As long as the Bank values your service, you are likely to come to no harm.

  WORK FOR EVERYONE 
 I have sent a message for  women  and  children  to  this  effect:libtech_150_footnoteEnough khadi can be produced if children up to the age of twelve and women gave a few hours of their spare time to spinning and other processes of khadi production. I had asked Krishnadas Gandhi to work out some figures to prove the above contention. I give below an abstract of the findings.
 India’s population was estimated at about 35 crores in the 1931 census. Children in the age-group of eight to twelve numbered about 4_ crores and women and girls above the age of 12 numbered about 11 crores. If the children devoted four hours to cleaning, carding and spinning and if the women devoted four hours to cleaning, carding, spinning and weaving daily, enough khadi can be produced. It can be shown by calculation that the children can produce every day yarn of ten to twelve counts that can be woven into 90 lac square yards of khadi, whereas the women can produce every day two crore square yards of twenty counts in addition to weaving the ninety lac square yards of khadi out of the yarn spun by the children.  It has been calculated  that  the  entire  process  from  the cleaning of cotton to weaving a 20 counts square yard of cloth involves 18 hours of labour on the part of one person.  Out of this half an hour will go to the cleaning of cotton, two hours for carding, 12 hours for spinning, one hour for
 
 unwinding the yarn, one hour for making and fixing the warp and sizing and one and a half hours for actual weaving. This is the breakdown of the total of 18 hours. It is based on  the average skill of an average person. An efficient worker may complete this process in just 15 hours. On a rough estimate the women and children can, with such skill as they have, produce about 30 square yards of khadi for every person in this country by working four hours a day for 300 days in a year.
 My object in publishing this abstract is to encourage an institution to undertake an experiment to corroborate it. Any family can easily produce all the cloth that it requires by introducing a charkha and a loom in their home. Suppose there are 35 individuals in an institution including four children in the age-group of 8 to 12 and 11 women above the age of 13. All men, of course, will be busy with other activities. Ten out of the eleven women and all the four children can devote three to four hours every day to cleaning, carding, spinning and weaving according to their convenience. One of the ten women will help the four children and will also weave the yarn produced by the children. The remaining nine women will undertake all the work from cleaning to weaving. According to the calculations given above, the four children together with one woman will produce at least three fourths of a square yard of 10 to 12 counts khadi every day and the 9 women will easily produce two square yards of 20 counts khadi every day. If we calculate for 300 days in a year, all of them will together produce 225 square yards of coarse khadi and 600 square yards of fine khadi. Thus a total of 825 square yards of cloth will be available for the 35 persons or, in other words, everyone will get 23_ square yards of cloth. As the efficiency grows every individual will be able to get 27_ square yards of cloth.
 It should be remembered that so much cloth can be produced even in less time by using the now improved charkhas and carding- bows. If every home has a charkha and a loom we can produce the cloth we need with very little effort. It will create a great contentment in the home. We can only imagine what an impact this can have on our lives and how it can inspire all the people. But for oneself one can instantly discover this bliss.

  BLANKETS FOR SOLDIERS 
 It is a good augury that votaries of non-violence often raise fine questions of principle. Man advances through such spirit of inquiry, but there is a prerequisite condition to it. The inquiry should not be like that of a person who strains at a gnat and swallows a camel. Raising such questions profit only him who is ever vigilant in major matters and whose practice keeps pace with the progress of the principle.
 Let me illustrate what I mean. A certain khadi bhandar received an order for woollen blankets from the military. The bhandar authorities asked me whether they could accept it replied that they could. The question of principle raised was whether it did not amount to helping the war.
 As a matter of abstract principle, it will have to be conceded that the acceptance was a breach. But in that case, we must leave India and every country engaged in the war. Because we help war in purchasing the very food we eat. We do the same when we travel by train or buy postage stamps. Our use of the currency itself is an aid to war. In fact we are hardly able to do any act which is free from the taint.
 The truth is that no one is able to act upon a great principle, like that of non-violence, in its entirety. Like the geometrical line, it can only be imagined, but never drawn. In practice, we have to be content with drawing only such fine lines as we can with our instruments. There is no wall which can be called ‘straight’ according to Euclid. And yet, walls have stood the test of time for thousands of years. It is the same with ahimsa. We must put it into practice as best as we can.
 It would have been easy for me to forbid the sale of the blankets. It was a question of only a few thousand rupees, a small amount for an establishment whose turnover is in lakhs. But the prohibition would have been a matter of shame for me. I could have done so only by  concealing my real view of the matter. Where should I draw the line from which such prohibition should commence? If I were a grain merchant, should I decline to sell it to soldiers? Or, if I were a chemist, should I refuse to sell quinine and other drugs to them? If  I  should, what c ould be the reason for my doing so? Does my ahimsa prevent me from  entertaining  such  customers?  In other  words,  does  it require of me to look into the occupations of my customers? The
 clear reply is that provided I deal in goods which conduce to the welfare of society, I may not look into the occupations of my customers. This means that I may sell my innocuous articles even to soldiers.

 Khadi Jagat, September 1941
 
  UNCERTIFIED KHADI 
 One who purchases uncertified khadi is ignorant of the purpose of khadi, which was conceived as a simple means to remove the poverty of Daridranarayana, which alone can improve India’s economic condition and ultimately win freedom. Therein lies the importance of khadi and if khadi has to play its role in removing the poverty of the millions it must be under the control of some organization or State authority. Crores of spinners would be willing to spin for eight hours for a paltry pice for they must fill their bellies. Khadi made from yarn spun by them may be called hand-spun but by its use we certainly will not be serving Daridranarayana. The Charkha Sangh has therefore at once increased the spinners’ wages and attempts are being made to improve the economic condition of other artisans.
 Those who sell uncertified khadi are guilty of theft from khadi-artisans. To purchase such khadi is to acquire stolen property. This is atrocious. The Charkha Sangh therefore appeals to business people to take up some other trade instead  of  selling  [uncertified] khadi. The public should purchase khadi from khadi bhandars of the Charkha Sangh or its certified depots only.
 I hope all khadi-lovers will agree that khadi, be it dear or cheap, should be purchased only through the Charkha Sangh and such khadi alone should be recognized as khadi.

  	I had long and frank talks with Khan Bahadur (Alla Bux). He is now 	going to Karachi. From there he will go to see Maulana. I am firmly 	of the view that the Congress should leave the Assembly. Khan 	Bahadur also, if he is on the Congress side, should do the same. The 	Congress in Sind helping the war effort while not doing so elsewhere 	would produce—is producing—a bad impression. Keeping up this 	arrangement will not benefit the country in any way, neither Sind 	nor    
 the Hindus nor the Muslims. Can a wrong step benefit anybody? Even if there were no war, I would be in favour of the Congress leaving the Assembly in Sind. But that is a side issue just now. I will discuss it with you if you wish. Here, I have explained how my mind is working, so that you may be able to understand Khan Bahadur correctly. He says he is convinced by my reasoning.

  LETTER TO PRITHVI SINGH 
 September 20, 1941
 BHAI PRITHVI SINGH,
 Your letter is good and so is your question. For the dearth of khadi I do not blame anyone. Everyone works according to  his  capacity. The problem of khadi is difficult. Even those who were not habitual khadi-wearers buy some. The highest consumption of khadi is in Bombay. Is not khadi our dharma? Dharma as such is difficult to follow. Having said so much, I who am its pioneer cannot be credited with perfect tapascharya. I am not sorry for it. I have done my best. But the non-stop plying of the wheel that you suggest is no small matter. There are such devotees, aren’t there? Some day khadi is bound to become universal.
 Now about Russia. We can do nothing. I do not find much difference between the three. It is true that much has been done in Russia for the people. The slaughter that is going on does not raise my hair. The civil war mentioned in the Bhagawata may be imaginary, but in real life it is true. When violence increases in the world internecine wars are bound to take place. Out of this will non-violence be born if there are some truly non-violent people. I believe we are such people. I cannot say how ahimsa will be born. This power is beyond description. It can be seen only in its impact. God alone regulates it. My peace and my firmness are based on this faith: See what Russia has done. Once it took help from Germany and now from England. Who can say what Russia will do if she loses? From the point of view of ahimsa today we can be no more but [mute] witnesses of this slaughter. Yes, but when an occasion arises we should be ready for sacrifice.
Kishorelalbhai will write something on non-violent exercise.

  	What you write is certainly worth thinking over. I thought over it 	but finally came to the conclusion that Jamnalalji’s ability could 	fully develop only in  gosevalibtech_168_footnotework. Though we have a Goseva Sangh, the work remains 	neglected. We have been able to get neither experts nor money. We 	have only been able to prepare the ground. The work can be done, 	however, only if an experienced man dedicates himself to it.  	Harijan work has got going and is getting on the rails. What is 	being done is necessary. Ultimately it is the awakening among 	Harijans themselves that will solve the problem.  	Work is being done among sanatanists also, though it is true that no 	publicity is being given to it. Being a dedicated Harijan worker,    
 J[amnalalji] will be able to win over many sanatanists while engaged in goseva. Finally, when you read the accompanying letterlibtech_169_footnote, the position will be clearer to you. Return the letter. There is one special reason also. J[amnalalji] wants to cultivate greater purity. He craves for purity of mind. Service of the cow might satisfy his craving, for the cow is more mute than even the Harijans. If we do not look after her, she will not rebel, but die. Harijans, on the other hand, are being taught by us to rebel. If we don’t teach them, others are eager to do so. In the Bharatiya Parishadlibtech_170_footnote, I think Abdul Haq Saheb had proposed a resolution to the effect that Hindi-Urdu should be adopted in place of Hindi-Hindustani. What was the resolution, if not this?

  LETTER TO VITHALDAS JERAJANI 
 September 23, 1941
 BHAI VITHALDAS,
 I had meant to write to you when I saw your English letter to Jajuji, but I could not manage it. I have now your Gujarati letter.
 Why did you write in English? We can never pour out our hearts in English. A man like Jawaharlal may be able to do that for he has studied English since his childhood, and he learnt it in England. But let that be.
 There is some error in your reasoning. If we wish to open small stores everywhere, we shall necessarily have to entrust each store to one man only. We cannot employ another man to help him. You do not seem to have any experience of village stores. Poor village store-keepers, how can they afford assistants? If the man leaves his store, he will shut the door and lock it up, and then go out. If he has a son, he might perhaps leave it in his charge. In South Africa thousands of stores are run by our people and by Jews, and they are, each of them, in charge of one person only. It would not be paying to  have more  than one person.  And  in most cases the person  lives  just  behind  the store itself. If he has to leave the  store  for any reason, he will  shut  the  door  and    go   out.  The store has stocks hardly worth  Rs.
 500. How can the man, then,  afford  an  assistant?  Moreover,  we  are
 
 dreaming of ushering in a new age, the age of ahimsa. We should keep our stores open only for reasonable periods, not from six  in  the  morning till twelve at night. In England the stores are closed at fixed hours by law. We should follow that practice voluntarily. The English in India do so. But irrespective of their practice, we should arrange our affairs on the basis of the law of ahimsa. We should, therefore, plan the whole thing from that point of view.
 I believe that we should give thought to the question of location,
too.
I agree with your view that the science of sales is different from
 that of production. And as the science of khadi production is different from the science of production of other goods, so also is the science of khadi sales different from the science of selling of other goods. We have always postponed thinking about this matter. The little thought we have occasionally given to the matter is not enough. Morning is when we wake up. I have now been making the khadi world think about this matter.
 Our work is not being controlled by one man, but we have still not been fully organized as an institution either. The reason is that we have not trained the requisite number of workers. We started no school for them. Now we have started onelibtech_171_footnote. Let us see how it fares.
 The implication of your English letter was that the  question  should be considered by the Council. I think that the time for that has not yet come. First, Jajuji, you and I should think about it. Finally, of course, the Council will have to consider the matter. The objection you took in your English letter to Jajuji expressing his views seemed altogether improper to me. If a secretary does his duty cons- cientiously, he must guide the others. That you did not approve of his suggestions was a different matter. But so long as we accept a man as secretary, he is bound to guide us.

 You did write to me about your Conference taking a village. It might be possible to find someone. We shall discuss when you return.

 CHI. ANNAPURNA,
 Do not lose heart. What does it matter if the fever has not left you completely? It is bound to leave you some day. The real cause has not been diagnosed, and hence this delay. You will certainly improve in the climate there. And also resolve in your mind that you will not allow yourself to become a burden on others.

I wish to 	call Chandravadan, but only if you two are agreeable. Sarala and I t 	alked about many

  	Nanibehn Jhaveri has passed away. This seems incredible, but it is 	one of those acts of God which nobody can comprehend.  	I understand about Allah Bux. I have of course told him that we will 	accept Maulana’s decision. But I have also told him at the same 	time that, if he is convinced of the necessity of leaving, he should 	convince Maulana also and, resigning his office, go into the 	wilderness with the Congress. There is no breach of promise or 	anything like that in this. But let us leave it alone. When you 	come, we shall have a brief discussion about the pros and cons of 	the suggestion. My view regarding Sind is not new. But the old view 	has grown stronger and I hold it to be applicable to all provinces. 	I am in no hurry.  The suggestion can be acted upon only if most of 	us accept it. “Most” includes Maulana also.  	Do give, within reasonable limits, the time required by homoeopathy 	to cure you. I have heard much about the water at Hajira, but do not 	know about Deolali. Hajira may possibly agree with you. Everything 	else failing, you can try nature cure. But we should first meet and 	have a brief discussion.  	The little girl’s illness is getting prolonged. It seems from 	Manibehn’s letter that she may even survive.  	Rajendra Babu is all right. Jamnalalji’s problem cannot still be 	said to have been solved. I 	hope Bhulabhai will get well. I 	am not writing separately to Mani.

  LETTER TO MAGANLAL P. MEHTA 
 September 28, 1941
 CHI. MAGANLAL,
 I learnt, by chance, only the day before yesterday about your having failed. You have not failed only in one subject. This indicates that you lack aptitude for law. This is true of many people. There have been great men who were deficient in certain capacities. Everybody cannot be a mathematician. One should follow the path indicated by one’s gifts. I would, therefore, urge you to give up your ambition of passing the examination and to devote yourself exclusively to your business. Whatever little knowledge of law you have acquired will remain with you. I do wish, of course, that you should improve your English. But if you are disinclined to that labour, I will not insist on that either. I should also like you to be tested thoroughly by an  able professor and you should then agree to learn whatever subject he finds you have an aptitude for. I wish, too, that you should come here as early as possible and take the children to Rangoon. Urmi is pining for Rangoon all the time. She has now got tired of Sevagram. Appa has not been happy here from the very beginning. In these circumstances, the children will not progress. From every point of view, therefore, I suggest that you come over here, have a discussion and then go to Rangoon.

  	I have your letter. I am not going to worry at all about Annapurna.  	Ultimately, it is I who will have to think about Mother. Pyarelal is 	vacillating. If there is a difference of view, he is more in favour 	of having her here.  	If Mother does come, I would like to shift to the old hut and the 	portion of the hospital which I am using. I would return to the 	hospital where Mother can stay. Sankaran will no doubt  serve  her  	well. Mother can separately cook for herself whatever she wants. 	Pyarelal 
 thinks that Mother can help in the hospital. What do you think about all this ? Consult Mother also.
 The ghee turned out to be expensive. How can I bear the thought that it was made at home from 64 1bs. of milk ?

 MY DEAR RATHI,
I had your letter of 14th instant.
 I am glad Dr. Abanindra Babu has been electedlibtech_189_footnote. Please give him my congratulations. I would only have accepted the responsibility if I could not have escaped it. At my time of life the natural desire is to lessen the burdens, not to add to them.
 I can give myself no rest till the five lacs are collected. I shall avoid travelling so far as I can but I dare not, if the full amount is not forthcoming. It is a debt I owe both to Gurudev’s and Deenabandhu’s memory.
I shall be glad when you are free to come here.

Courtesy : Dr. Sushila Nayyar     GUARD AGAINST CREDIT   	In this business of khadi, as in any other, I know that we sell on 	credit to increase the sales but ultimately suffer losses. While I 	was practising law in South Africa I used to examine the accounts  	of hundreds of businessmen who were my clients. They used to provide 	25 per cent for bad debts. As a result they would charge a very high 	rate  of profit. Some of them would go bankrupt. My experience of 	conducting Indian Opinion, Navajivan, Young India and Harijan 	has shown me that we escaped losses because we never sold on 	credit. Nor 
 did this policy adversely affect the number of our subscribers. One direct benefit of this policy was that only those subscribed to these periodicals who cared for them. There can however be no comparison between khadi and other kinds of business. Khadi is an altruistic affair. It is conceived as service to the starving millions. Then why should we sell khadi on credit?
 My personal conviction therefore is that under no circumstances and to no person should we sell khadi on credit. If we firmly followed this policy we shall spare ourselves much unnecessary expenditure and can even bring down the price of khadi. And simultaneously we shall be able to give our customers satisfaction.
 It is a general rule of the Charkha Sangh that no bhandar under its jurisdiction shall release goods on credit. I am afraid everyone has not been able to observe this rule hundred per cent. I submit that mere enunciation of a rule whose importance we cannot appreciate is not much good. I hope, therefore, that all khadi workers will clearly understand the policy of not giving credit and then follow it unfailingly.

   SPEECH AT GOSEVA SANGH MEETING       NALWADI, 
  September 30, 1941 You should adopt a simple and brief 	constitution  without provision for so many categories of members. 	All the members should  	be of one category and there should be no patrons at all. Those who 	contribute will do  so  not  for the sake of  name.  Some  of  them 	may contribute anonymously and may not even like to  disclose  their 	names. 
 You don’t stand to gain by having various categories of membership. The members are not going to have any privileges. Our purpose is to render service, not to enjoy privileges. Even ten or twenty members capable of rendering concrete service would suffice. Every member must be bound by the condition to use only cow’s milk, ghee, etc., and leather made from dead cattle. In this no laxity should be permitted. A small committee to carry on the work of the society may be formed.
 I formed the opinion, even while in South Africa, that we would have to give up the lure of buffalo’s milk and ghee. Cow-protection helps protection of the buffalo also. It cannot be that everybody would give up buffalo’s milk but there is real danger of people giving up cow’s milk. If, therefore, we do not protect the cow, both the buffalo and the cow are sure to be doomed.
 Our fault is—this is a fault found in all men, but more particularly among Indians—that we grab what is easily available and we let go what is difficult to obtain. People find khadi, village industries organization and the like inexpensive and convenient. They prefer buffalo milk because it is sweet and cheap.
 Since the times of the Vedas we have been glorifying the cow— not the buffalo. Had the cow not been so glorified, it would have  perished and along with it the buffalo. I have studied the comparative figures of the cows and buffaloes in India. Both are in plenty  but neither of them is making any progress. So long as it pays him, the milkman keeps the cow or the buffalo after which he sells them to the butcher. The butcher utilizes the proceeds for purchasing more cattle. The cow-protectionwallahs purchase these cows or buffaloes in order to save them from the butcher’s knife. A couple of cows are saved in this manner but it spells disaster for the cow in general. The correct remedy, therefore, lies in forgetting the cow already sold and in investing funds for improving the breed, raising its value and in teaching cattle-keepers their dharma.
 Let no one fear that the buffalo will become extinct if all give up its milk and ghee. As I have already told you this will hardly happen and even if it did there would be no harm. The buffalo will return to the jungle. What we must protect is the cow and, because the milk of both is useful, the buffalo will also be saved along with the cow. But if instead of following the scientific method everybody, in the name of cow-protection, sets about acting according to his  own fancy, both  the cow and the buffalo are sure to he doomed. It was mainly  owing to our ignorance that so many other things in our country similarly met their doom. We can realize our duty towards the
 animal world and discharge it by wisely pursuing our dharma of service to the cow. At the root of cow-protection is the realization of  our dharma towards the sub-human species. But our service to the cow is service only in name and all of us are therefore tending to forget our dharma.
 Statistically speaking, India has one-fourth of the world’s cattle population. But the plight of our cattle is worse than that of the human population, bad as it is.
 One who serves the cow must take cow’s milk only and not goat’s milk. I take goat’s milk out of my helplessness. But the members of the Cow-protection Society must take only cow’s milk and ghee and use only leather made from dead cows and buffaloes. Where even cows and buffaloes are being slaughtered, how can one get leather made from dead goats? Mankind has till this day taken it for granted that the goat is born only to be butchered. Today being Dussehra,  in  Calcutta thousands of goats must have been sacrificed to Goddess Kali.
 Ghee should not present any problem for the rich. Just as they carry with them some lavender, Eau de Cologne and a toothbrush, similarly they should also have cow’s ghee or else they should not think of cow-protection. The problem of milk is not as simple as that of ghee. In Almora cow’s milk is not available at any cost. The same condition prevails in Orissa. We can make milk by dissolving  mavalibtech_192_footnotelibtech_193_footnotein water. We use Horlicks powder because it is a good thing and easily digestible. But why should we not make a similar powder here? We should acquire the scientific knowledge and make it locally so that powder milk could be available even at the top of the Himalayas.
 Jamnalal’s health is not so good that he can be allowed to go to jail again. If he falls ill after going there I shall not be able to bear it. This struggle is going to be a prolonged one. When the time comes I shall myself ask him to leave everything and go to jail. But today it is my duty not to send him to jail. What should be his field of activity then? He placed before me a few suggestions such as Harijan [work], khadi, cow-protection, etc. Of them I liked cow-protection. He was associated with this work from its inception and whatever work has so far been done has not been wasted. It was by and large being conducted according to my own understanding and advice. Now it will be run under Jamnalalji’s guidance.
 Cow-protection is service to the dumb creation. Today Harijans are weak but tomorrow they can become strong and make progress on
 
 
 their own, for they possess all the human faculties. If tomorrow Harijans rise and take possession of temples, I shall dance [for joy]. But the cow has no such strength. She can be strong and healthy only if we feed her. She will always be a docile animal. You may hit or even kill her, but she cannot revolt against you. Who is then going to protect her? Jamnalal’s spiritual craving will be satisfied by serving the cow. I have, therefore, entrusted this work entirely to him and he will run it with his business instinct as well as his altruistic disposition.
 Cow-protection is a stupendous task. We will have to study this science in a dispassionate manner. We must bring together all those who have studied this subject from the modern scientific angle. We should have a band of efficient gosevaks who can go where demanded. If Swami Ananda wishes to come he may, though he can carry on the work in Thana itself. He should decide about the area of his activity and concentrate his energy there. In this way, let us take the map of India and divide it into ten or hundred divisions. The person in charge of each division will send in his report. There are a number of goshalas in India which should be inspected and run on proper lines. If an expert is required anywhere we should be in a position to send one.
 It requires a man of purity to become a servant of the cow. A person of ability alone will not do. I see no need of touring at present for this work. It should be possible to do a lot of work while stationed at one place. To begin with, from now on we can supply cow’s milk in Wardha itself to those who are prepared to use it.

  Library. 	Courtesy : Dr. Sushila Nayyar     MESSAGE TO STATES’ PEOPLE   October 1, 1941 I hold 	strong and decided views on the relationship between the Princes and 	the people. I am convinced that, in the new world order,  	which is bound to follow the insensate butchery, dignified by the 	name of war, the Princes will have place only if they become true 	servants of 
 the people, deriving their power not from the sword but from the love and consent of the people.
 Such being my fixed view, I advise the people of the States to cultivate patience and prepare themselves for the responsibilities that will devolve on them, willy-nilly, by assiduously doing mute constructive work.
 This does not mean submission to active and acute tyranny, of which I have so many accounts coming to me. This the victims must resist in the best manner they can. The only best manner I know is the way of non-violence, otherwise called conscious and deliberate self-suffering. But cases of individual torture and degradation  have  come under my notice. If they are true and if the tortured persons do not know the way of non-violence, they will resist the tortures with all the violence they can summon from within and die in the attempt to resist the torture and the degradation. That violent resistance will almost count as non-violence, even as the resistance of a mouse to a ferocious cat will count. I have in mind an unarmed man under torture by an armed company of torturers. No man, however weak in body, if he has the will to resist and the capacity to die bravely, need feel helpless against odds, however heavy.
 I would like the Princes to accept my claims to be  their  true friend. As such, I would like to tell them that the way to read the signs of the times is to realize the utter helplessness of the sword. The Biblical saying is going to prove true sooner than we had expected: “For all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword.”

 Ramdas has become our neighbour now. At present he appears to be calm. His health also has improved a little.

  	I have your letter. Today the Ashram is teeming with people. They 	just keep coming. The spinning-wheels are plying. I too gave an hour 	to it.  	I have understood about Mother. Now it is for you and me to decide. 	Even if this building is handed over for the hospital, Mother can 	still stay in your room. What does she herself desire ? Is she 	willing to come ? Is she enthusiastic ? Discuss it with her and 	write to me. In whatever is done, we have to think of what will be 	convenient to you and Mother. What inconvenience can it cause me ? 	If I think of all these people at the Ashram as an inconvenience, 	then Mother too would be an inconvenience. Ultimately, she has to 	come here. Hence, while taking a decision do not assume that she may 	be a burden to me.   BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original : Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library.

  	Your letter. Ahimsa was born along with man. Hitler too does not 	kill his own people. This is ahimsa though in a very limited 	measure. As ahimsa is the very nature  of  the  atman,  either man comes to it out of weariness or accepts it willingly, 	as we are trying to  do. Know that our endeavour in comparison with 	the achievement of a 
 siddhalibtech_209_footnoteis like a drop in the ocean. But the drop also has the essence of the ocean, so it is no small thing. The rest when you come here.

  SPEECH AT GANDHI JAYANTI MEETING 
 October 2, 1941 However mean or insignificant the work may be, God values it more, provided it is done for service and without any hope of return.
 Thus sweepers’ work is more valuable if it is done selflessly and with the motive of serving.
 Gandhiji appealed to the audience to help in cow-protection work, in preserving the cow which was now perishing due to neglect. The evil, if not checked, would, he said, result in serious deterioration of the agricultural wealth of the country.
 In conclusion, he appealed to them to develop charkha and spinning.
I do not value my Jayanti Day, but I call it ‘Charkha Jayanti’.
 Gandhiji told the villagers that he would come every night amongst them for prayer, provided they liked it, as this would establish increased contact with them, but they must be punctual and regular.libtech_212_footnote

  STATEMENT IN COURT libtech_215_footnote 
 SEVAGRAM,
 October 3, 1941
 It is no pleasure for me to appear before this court for the third time except the natural pleasure one derives from the performance of one’s duty. But for the peremptory call of duty I should not have reappeared before this court.
 Deep meditation for which jail life provides an ample opportunity has convinced me more than ever of the correctness of the Congress resolution to offer civil disobedience in vindication of the right of free speech to the extent of inviting those who listen to oppose the war in every shape or form.
 The rivers of blood that are daily flowing in this war which is without parallel in barbarity and ferocity should convince even the confirmed sceptic of the utter immorality of the war. Except for hypnotism which hardens even the sense of perception, there should not be any difficulty in preceiving the crime against humanity which the present war means.
 It is difficult to strike the balance between the right  and  the wrong. The right can only belong to the party that washes its hands clean of blood-guiltiness and dares the aggressor by accepting the law of self–suffering through non-violent action to do his worst.
 Though seemingly the Congress fight is in defence of the right to preach against association with all wars or at least this war, it is none the less an effort to convince the world of the immeasurable superiority of non-violent action over the violent resistance even in a cause considered just.
 Let no one attribute ineffectiveness to the studied mildness of the Congress action. Actions appearing insignificant have led before now to astounding results. Those of us who are privileged to take part in the struggle have a living faith that our civil disobedience will lead to a result fraught with the greatest benefit to mankind.

  LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL

 BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
 We shall meet soon now. However, I wish to write about one thing. Manibehn writes and tells me that . . .libtech_223_footnotelibtech_224_footnotewill appear for mill-owners in a case against workers. I cannot believe this. But how can Mani make such a  mistake? At first, therefore, I  thought of writing to.      libtech_225_footnotelibtech_226_footnoteOn second
 thoughts, however, I feel that there was no need for me to write while you were there. You yourself can solve the problem. If Mani is right, send for      libtech_227_footnotelibtech_228_footnoteand tell him that, if at all, he should appear on behalf of
 the workers. He cannot appear on behalf of the mill-owners under any circumstances. The other point is that, so far as I understand,        libtech_229_footnotelibtech_230_footnotewas
 not to resume practice. He has dedicated himself to national service. He may accept a brief in special circumstances. But if he starts practice like any other lawyer, his conduct would deserve the severest condemnation. I am quite clear in my mind that he was not to resume practice. He has left the Congress in order to clarify his position from a moral point of view. But in all other respects he is a Congressman. I had thought that by leaving the Congress he had, like me, become more of  a Congressman. He seemed frank and straightforward to me, is capable of responding to an appeal to the heart and of self-sacrifice, and is a man ready to correct his error. If you share this impression, send for him and explain this to him. We should treat him as a Congressman for all practical purposes.
 I suppose you know that Maulana wants . . . to leave the  Assembly. I see no such need. Rajendra Babu does not see any, nor does the Professor. I think you also do not see any. Am I right? Or do I stand corrected?

  	I have your letter of 28th ultimo. I had your previous letter too. I 	thank you for both.  	The copy of Polak’s letter is important. He has developed of late 	a strange attitude on Indian affairs. It is not less unfortunate 	because it is sincerely held. What he considers unreal is altogether 	real for us. Pakistan may be unreal. I hold it to be dangerous. But 	it is too real to be dismissed with contempt. C[ivil] D[isobedience] 	may be unreal. But I should resent anybody calling it unreal. Sir 	Tej Bahadur’s wrath is not unreal. It is symptomatic of the Indian 	temper. I know nobody who considers this war to be India’s war. 	The utter disregard of the sentiment of politically-minded India is 	a dangerous reality. I 	can heartily share Polak’s hope that you may be used by God 
 for bringing peace between the two communities. Polak has forgotten what he knew before as well as I do, that the Princes are not free agents. They have no will but the British will, they have no status but what the British may give them from moment to moment. To say that we must produce an agreement to which the Princes are party is as much as to say that the British should be party.
 You may send this to Polak, if you think it will serve any useful purpose. I have simply given you my reaction to Polak’s, if only in appreciation of your considerateness in sending me the copy.
 I hope you have no difficulty in deciphering my writing. With regards to you and the family.
 Yours sincerely,

         CHI. 	CHAKRAYYA,   LETTER TO CHAKRAYYA     October 	6, 1941 
  	It is sad that you had an attack of giddiness. I think it was due to 	the weight on your mind. So it is good that you wrote everything. 	But there is no reason to be sorry about it.  	The complaint about partiality is correct. None else is at fault 	except Ba and myself. Ba has not been able to give up [the feeling 	of] ‘mine’ and ‘thine’, and I cannot leave Ba. Hence the 	progress of the Ashram has stopped. But there are many good 	qualities in Ba, which I cannot forget. It is difficult to free 	oneself from ‘mine’ and ‘thine’. But the change that has 	taken place in Ba’s life is no small thing. From where did Ba 	attain such purity? Her simplicity, patience, etc., are qualities of 	a high order. Hencc Ba’s partiality deserves to be tolerated. 	There is no venom in her partiality.  	You have been unfair to Krishnachandra and Shakaribehn. 	Krishnachandra does nothing for his own sake. He gave up his home, 	his studies, and he labours in the Ashram. If he tried to save five 	annas, it was not for himself. He will not be partial to anyone. lt 	is a different matter if he is frightened and is exploited by 	someone. So it is with Shakaribehn. If I relieve her from work, she 	would stay away, and also like it. She is like that. You should 	understand that all of us in the Ashram are imperfect; even then we 	try to be good. Your duty is to look at your own faults and be 	tolerant of others’. This rule is for us all. You 
 have seen the figure of three monkeys on my desk, haven’t you? One monkey has closed his ears, another his eyes and the third one his mouth. The suggestion is, hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. I hope you would be satisfied with this. Read this letter again and again. Get well soon.

  	I have your letter and the cheque through Prithvi Singh. Why is the 	cheque of the Travancore bank ? Does it give [a higher] interest or 	provide more facilities ? Where can that cheque be encashed ? It 	must be charging a handsome commission. I shall of course make 	inquiries.  	Can you accommodate both the sisters ? How is it your studies get 	constantly interrupted ? I shall not let you sit for the examination 	if you are not fully prepared. There should be no question which you 	cannot answer.

The 	knowledge you have gained is not going to be wasted, and so, if it 	takes some more time, so be it. Because, I also do not wish that you 	should spoil your eyes and health by continuously reading night and 	day in order to pass. Passing in this way is no better than failing. 	You have to appear for the examination not for name but for service. How 	much khadi did you sell and where did you sell it ?  	The Ashram is now becoming very crowded. Vijaya and Vasumati have 	come. Pannalal has come. Some others will be arriving. More people 	are eager to come. How can I accommodate them ?

 CHI. MATHURADAS,
 In my opinion you have been saved from the jaws of death. I had been haunted by the fear. So now you have definitely been saved, have you not ? Do not worry at all. Let Bombay be sunk in the back bay. When Mithila was burning, King Janaka was not perturbed in the least. Why should we lag behind Janaka ? Why should we not outdo him ? How that can be done, God alone knows. But he has shown us that we should be like him.
 Taramati must be happy. There is a telegram from Harkisan. But I am not writing to him separately. He has done creditable work as your nephew. Because you gave me detailed information at once,  I  also caused a stir.

   SPEECH AT A. I. S. A. MEETING       WARDHA, 
  October 	7, 1941  	Today I must speak on one or two fundamental questions. You must all 	have read Pandit Jawaharlal’s letter in Khadi Jagat. 	 Jawaharlal’s language generally tends to be strong. But I 	feel that this is a good letter. We must pay attention to its 	purport. He is discontented. He asks why we have not been able to do 	more work. He feels we have not given enough consideration to the 	matter. I would not  entirely agree. We have been giving 	consideration to the matter from time to time and even today we are 	seized of it. But I must admit our sadhana, our tapasya, 	has not been adequate. This is the point made by Jawaharlal. His 	very name evokes thoughts of awakening  and inspiration. Jawaharlal 	has always recognized the importance of khadi but after he went to 	jail he has come to feel more acutely on the subject. We must give 	due thought to his letter.  	The news coming in from all sides shows that the demand for khadi 	has sharply increased. It has risen so much that we are not in a 	position to meet it. The demand for charkhas too is so great that we 	can never cope with it! What can we do? In many places, the money 	value of the work, which was a few hundred rupees, is now a few 	thousand rupees. You may have heard that in Ranchi, Bihar, while the 	sale of khadi at the last Jayanti was of the order of Rs. 600, it 	has now risen to Rs. 10,000. What I say is that we must go on 	producing as much khadi as we can. We should not let ourselves be 	deterred by the fear that it might not be sold. We must never allow 	ourselves to think for a moment that khadi cannot be sold. Yes, we 	may not have enough capital to substantially increase the production 	of khadi. In that case we should try to find the capital.  	We must carefully consider what should be our technique of work. 	Someone has written saying that a lot of yarn has piled up with him 	and asked how he is to get it woven. We must have the resources to 	have such yarn woven or exchanged for khadi. We must be able to 	accept all the yarn that comes and supply in exchange such khadi in  	such  quantities as we can.  	We must also so improve the quality of our yarn that even the least 	efficient weavers may be able to weave it. It is said that we cannot 	spin any yarn of the strength of mill yarn. This is to some extent 	true. But this does not satisfy me. May be  we  cannot  compete  	with mills in  the quality of the yarn. Even so the difference 	should not be too great 
 and it should gradually diminish. Today our yarn leaves much room for improvement. We have not made the progress that is desired in this field. There is much work that we have to do. We must discover and show to the people ways of producing good and strong yarn. A lot of research into the subject is needed. We have not paid sufficient attention to the matter. We have been slack.
 We must decentralize our work. Yarn should be woven where it is spun. We have been able to do so much since middle-class people took to spinning Now if they will also take up weaving we can rally the weavers round us and take them forward. We should make efforts in this direction also.
 The demand for charkhas is on the increase everywhere. This too shows that more and more people are taking to spinning. For myself I have decided that we cannot send charkhas to every place from outside. They should be manufactured locally. I am beginning to think that dhanush takli alone can solve the problem. It can be made everywhere. The Yeravda charkha has its place and it will remain. But it cannot be made everywhere. It would be well if we could provide taklis to the millions. But the plying of the takli calls for devoting special time, labour and attention. It is also possible we may not be able to produce yarn in sufficient quantities on the takli. It is not that with the dhanush takli as much yarn can be produced as with any other charkha. It is easy to ply and easy to make. It can be made even without the aid of a carpenter. The making of the spindle for it may present some difficulty but not much. For even if a spindle is a little crooked, it can serve in a dhanush takli. We can make millions of dhanush taklis in a day. I admit  I will have a little difficulty in the beginning in making  people interested in it even as I had in making them interested in khadi but it will soon be overcome. We have to put a spur to the work of attaining self-reliance in khadi. This can be done only through the dhanush takli.
 I cannot agree with the suggestion that charkhas should be manufactured in a few factories and then sent out to every place from there. If we thus centralize the charkha it will be finished. Everything connected with the charkha should be made where the spinning is done. That is why I have suggested that every home should have a dhanush takli in it. Till we have fully gone into the thing we should not indulge in a mere intellectual discussion of the problem. Only he has a right to participate in any discussion on the matter who has plied a dhanush takli for  nine  hours  every  day  for a  month.  He will  have  a  right to express a view. I therefore  suggest  that you  should  give thought to the dhanush takli. But not merely because I am advocating  it. If  your experience refutes my  point you should not go  merely by
 
 what I say. I had spoken of giving spinners a daily wage of eight annas but so far we have not been able to go beyond three annas. Supposing we were to have the same experience here? This is a matter for research and experiment.
 In the same way we have to think about the yarn. We should think of developing the capacity to weave whatever yarn may come to us. We must in any case accept the self-sufficient yarn. The people who bring the yarn should accept the price we can give for it. Whether it is in the form of money or khadi we must not refuse to pay. If we cannot  arrange for yarn thus received to be woven, then we may say in Jawaharlal’s words that our creative faculties have become atrophied— we have lost our ability to think. This would be a defeatist attitude. We do not want to accept defeat.
 If we cannot take the weavers in our fold nothing will get done. But we cannot go by mere faith. Today they are using mill yarn. We have to change this situation. We have to give them handspun yarn. My feeling is that the War is not going to end soon. No import of cloth will he possible. Prices of textiles will also rise. Only Indian mills will be manufacturing cloth for use in India. A time may come when they will not be able to supply all our requirement. Cloth in India will then become scarce. In China too such a situation had arisen. But the Chinese are a hard-working people. They started the charkha in every home and in their own way quickly solved the problem. Our method will be a little different but the effort required will be as much or more. A day may come when people will ask us for cloth. It would be a disgrace to tell them that we could not supply it.
 We shall also have to think about cotton. It is my firm conviction that if we produce cotton in the manner it should be from the point of view of khadi we shall soon be free of the need for imports. If we produce cotton to feed the mills this will not be possible. I feel that the principle of producing cotton for mills is opposed to the principle of producing it for khadi. The convenience of the  mills  requires that cotton should be intensively grown in a few areas. Their aim will be to see that if cotton-growing is too scattered it should be brought together and concentrated in one place. But khadi requires that cotton should be grown in every village. No village should have to depend on another village for its cotton requirement. Khadi cannot afford transport of cotton from one village to another. We must immediately pay attention to the question how we can make cotton row in every village.
 Another matter has been placed before me for  my  consi- deration. Many of our khadi bhandars are very small. The question is
 whether in the interest of economy it will not be better that each such bhandar should be looked after by no more than one person. What we will have to consider in this connection is whether these bhandars are to remain open for a fixed time or as long as possible.
 If we want to make our lives khadi-based we shall have to devise certain rules as regards khadi bhandars. The rules will be different for towns and villages. For the towns I think we should follow the practice of English shopkeepers. They open shops according to their convenience. They keep them closed on Sundays. They don’t care about the customers. Gradually the customers become used to it. We also want to establish new habits. We should also make certain rules and fix a time for the opening of shops. The same consideration should apply to shops in rural areas. In South Africa there is one shop for an area of thousands of bighas. People come in mule-carts to make their purchases. Sometimes the shopkeeper is not there, since there only one person to look after the shop. But people are used to it. Similarly, it is not necessary for us to keep our bhandars open all the time. But the matter needs to be considered.
 Thus we shall have to give systematic thought to all these matters. We want to make of khadi an integrated way of life. We have to deal with artisans, spinners and weavers. In the sphere of production our aim is to pay equal wages to all. So far we have extorted forced labour from the spinners. This doctrine of paying the lowest wage and taking maximum work for it has been taken from the Arthashastra of Kautilya. We must change this doctrine for a new one. We shall give the same wage to spinners as we give to weavers. Those who produce cotton should also prosper. And yet we want that the burden on the buyer should be light. Thus we wish to create a socialist society. The socialism that India can digest will be of this kind. It will be the socialism of the poor, but of the well-to-do poor. The ideal of khadi is thus the promotion of a wholly socialistic way of life.
 In brief, we have to give thought to all the processes of khadi— from the growing of cotton to the selling of cloth. When we have thus succeeded in bringing about a self-sufficient socialist polity we shall no more be at the mercy of foreign markets. Our society will be like a self-sufficient agriculturist. To an agriculturist his land is his capital. He eats what the land yields. If some year there is a failure of crops he starves. He does not beg and he does not plunder.
That  is  all	I had to say. We must pay special attention to
 
 weaving. I have always said that just as we insisted that we should be good carders we should also insist that we should become good weavers.

 Again 	I follow the new rule of writing during the silence hour.  	So your cough is persistent. Poor Shummy. I am almost sure that the 	cough is due to some error in diet. Some grease, more starch, sour 	fruit, sloppy food, too much protein, both animal and vegetable, 	dal, spices ever so little, general indigestion. These are the 	causes according to my belief. Menkel’s manipulations are local. 	They can never bring permanent cure unless your digestive apparatus 	is in order.  	There is no moving out for me during this month. Almost all dates 	are booked. If Rajaji comes about 20th, it means four or five days’ 	conversations. Additions 	to the cottage are substantial and expensive.

  	I have your letter. You are filled with anxiety about your studies. 	Content yourself with as much as you can do. Your aim is not to pass 	an examination but to enhance your knowledge. Of course you have to 	appear for the examination but that should be when you feel fully 	confident. Do not worry about the delay. Let it take as long as it 	may.  	Pyarelal had spoken to me about the idea of your staying in Lahore. 	I had told him that I would keep myself ready to make the 	arrangements later. I forgot to write to you about the matter. I can 	make arrangements quickly if you will allow me to do so.  	Kanu having left, A.S. is doing the massage. Dhiren has his class at 	8, so A. S. has to do it. You should take it that all talk about my 	taking service from you has now ceased. Of course, I want you to    
 rise above all such talk. Why should it affect us whether somebody praises us or blames us ?
 My teaching was only with regard to the duty of a satyagrahi. A satyagrahi will not court imprisonment to forget his pain or to escape from it. He will do so in the faith that to offer satyagraha is his duty.
 As for A. S., I would only say that one should forget about her. One should accept whatever services she offers, but not expect anything from her.
 It seems Pyarelal’s statement has been well received. It is brief but to the point.
 Do not worry about my weight. Increasing it only gradually may be the best thing. I have again increased the quota of butter."

 MY DEAR IDIOT,
 Ramsarandas is an old devotee of Ludhiana. He has been regularly sending money and khadi. He has a doctor son in England, another in India but married to [a] Scotch girl. She wrote asking for permission for herself and Father-in-law to come and pass a few days at Sevagram. He became ill and was nursed back to health. His teeth were all extracted. They were the seat of disease. Bessie is a fine steady girl, extremely devoted to her father-in-law, nearly as old as I am. He insisted on doing C[ivil] D[isobedience]. He proposes to go again. He says he does not mind dying there.
 My tourlibtech_259_footnoteis off for the time being. For G.libtech_260_footnotesays he must try. If he fails, I might be allowed. Of course he won’t fail. I have told you about my anxiety.libtech_261_footnoteIt won’t be any more for you than for any other patient. But the point is not your anxiety or mine. It is that you should not become ill. You should find out the art of keeping well. You live on the border line. That is bad.
Love.

  	Who can approach a person dwelling in a dreamland? I do not remember 	the circumstances you have mentioned in your letter. Possibly I was 	engrossed in work and I was unable to talk to you at length. The 	fact is I try to be true to myself and give equal respect to all. 	But when misunderstandings crop up in a person’s mind, he imagines 	that I have changed.  	Received your poem. I have glanced through it. You know I have no 	knowledge of poetry or of prosody.

 BHAI MAITHILISHARAN,
 Your letter. You have done quite well. I have written to Dhirendralibtech_265_footnotelibtech_266_footnote. You must not incur expenditure in sending the yarn to me. It may as well be kept there. It will certainly be woven if it comes. I will of course use the khadi made out of the yarn sent by you. A shawl is being made out of it. After using it for a while I shall give it to Kakasaheblibtech_267_footnotelibtech_268_footnotefor sending it to   Kashi.  I  have  gone  through  your poem. Please convey my blessings to all and say that the more heart they put into spinning the nearer swaraj is bound to be. Never without it.

  SPEECH AT SEVAGRAM 
 October 12, 1941
 I did not know that such a big crowd would collect here. It is good that it has. It is an auspicious augury that two crore eighty thousand yards of yarn and Rs. 12,000 have been collected from the
 
 three divisionslibtech_269_footnoteof Central Provinces.
 I have received two letters from Agra Jail also. The prisoners there have spun a good deal of yarn. They did not have all the facilities for spinning. But after Dhirendra Majumdar had reached the Jail, how could he rest content without making everyone spin? He is one of the pillars of the Charkha Sangh. He was not expected to go to jail. But the Government sometimes becomes over-generous. It picks up some people without any ostensible reason.
 Shri Maithilisharanji is also there. He too was arrested without any good reason. He is a famous poet and he has sent me a poem also. But today poetry does not flow from his pen; it flows from the yarn that he spins. I have sent him today a short replylibtech_270_footnote. In that letter, too, I have said that with every round of yarn he and his co-prisoners have spun, they have brought swaraj so much the nearer.
 What I wrote to the poet is not mere rhetoric. I mean what I say. According to my definition, there cannot be true swaraj as long as there is exploitation. Mere change from British to Indian rule does not mean swaraj. As long as one class dominates over another, as long as the poor remain poor or become poorer, there will be no swaraj. In my swaraj the millions will live happily. They will get good food, decent house and enough clothing. By good food I do not mean that they will eat sweets. But everyone must get pure milk, pure ghee and sufficient fruit and vegetables. I know I am talking tall because the poor today do not even know what fruit is. During the mango season, they get a few mangoes and during the guava season they have a few guavas. They do not get any other fruit except these and a few other. They do not get even clean and nutritious foodgrain. They have to live on rotten rice, coarse grain and dirty salt. I wish everyone gets what they call a balanced diet as also a clean and comfortable house. This according to me is real freedom. I have written those words to Maithilisharanji with this kind of freedom in view.
 We have never produced as much yarn as we have produced this year. The reports that I get from the prisons make me dance for joy. Maithilisharanji writes to me that in the Agra Jail his Communist companions also join in spinning although they have no respect for my views. No one compelled them. They started spinning on their own. This is the way of ahimsa.
 
 I have also received reports from the Gujrat (Punjab) jail. I am not suggesting that everyone spins. I have the names of those too who are not spinning. But those who spin are in a majority. I become more hopeful when I see these facts. I am an irrepressible optimist. But even  I did not entertain such high hopes. The Congress Constitution does include the rule about khadi but till now the Congress Committee insisted on khadi only to conform to the rule. On this occasion, I believe, the work has been done with an element of faith.
 While I say all this, I am not so foolish as to believe that khadi is now on its feet. Whatever has been achieved is sufficient to strengthen my hope and my faith. But that is not enough for the growth of khadi. These are good omens. But they are not sufficient for the removal of poverty and unemployment. These problems cannot be solved as long as crores of people do not wear khadi. I have a dream that people will wear home-spun khadi just as they eat home-made food.
 I am talking of these things because people continue to ask me one question. Even today I have received a letter. They all ask, ‘What will be the outcome of this struggle? It is very slow and has no effect on the Government. The Government does not seem to care. A large number of satyagrahis are wandering in the streets. They are not even arrested. How can such a struggle be effective?’
 They may say what they like, but my feeling is that my fight is going on according to my plan. I am satisfied with its momentum. At present I do not want to increase it further. This does not mean that it will never gain momentum. When the occasion demands it will be accelerated. But this is not the occasion for it. Everything is good or bad in a particular context. There are occasions when mere bread is very useful. But when it is inopportune even jalebi libtech_271_footnoteis harmful. So when an opportune time comes, our fight will be intensified.
 Some people expect a miracle this very day. In ahimsa there is no scope for such sudden miracles. Ahimsa does not admit of sudden spurts. But those who will can always see the miracles of ahimsa. We watch the sky every day but we see no miracles there. But those who have an eye for it are spellbound by the spectacle. They see new miracles every moment. And the sky is only a small fragment of Divine Power. That Divine Power is also the source of ahimsa which
 
 works according to the Divine Law. That Law is so mysterious that even its miraculous effects do not appear to be such. They look like a natural course of events. Our non-violent struggle will also evolve according to the same Law. When independence comes through non- violence it will blossom forth so naturally that we may never notice the miracle having taken place.
 Some people say that this is the opportunity to pressurize the Government. From this point of view, they say, my present struggle of ahimsa is entirely lifeless. I want to point out to them that the contents of   the   Bombay   Resolutionlibtech_272_footnoteare   not   mere   prattle   nor   were   they intended to bluff the world. The Congress is a responsible trustworthy organization. Its resolutions are serious, sincere and without exaggeration. The Bombay Resolution pins its faith on the policy of non-violence.  It  has   a   passagelibtech_273_footnotewhich   should   keep   Congressmen always alert and watchful.
 When the policy of non-violence has been so clearly stated in the Bombay Resolution, how can we say that England’s difficulty is our greatest opportunity? How can the Congress say that we should give her one more blow when England is herself collapsing? And who knows whether England is actually collapsing? Outwardly of course it looks like that. But I do not believe it. Appearances are not always real. During the Boer War also there was an occasion when it appeared that England was almost defeated but the situation took a sudden turn and she came out victorious.
 Today also we do not know who is going to win. We do not want any one party to be defeated. We wish that all the warring parties should come to terms and live like brothers. How can you expect me to say that either Germany or Russia or Britain and America should be defeated? I would pray that no one is defeated and they all live like brothers.
 Ahimsa dictates : ‘Consider no one your enemy. Love even him who considers you his enemy.’ How can we then think of taking advantage of England’s predicament?
 You may say, ‘Then we are sure to be destroyed. We will suffer defeat at the hands of the British.’ This betrays lack of faith. A
 
 follower of non-violence suffers defeat at no one’s hands. I may repeat once again that ‘defeat’ has no place in the dictionary of ahimsa. Victory and defeat are the results of violent war. In ahimsa there is only victory and nothing else. At the moment I cannot tell you how our ahimsa is ultimately going to succeed.
 Not to embarrass Britain does not mean that we should help them. They are resorting to violent methods. We have to stand firm on our principle of ahimsa. This will no doubt create some difficulty for them. But we cannot help it. How can we give up a principle which is bound to lead to the welfare of the world including that of Britain? But if we violate our principle, we shall be guilty of violence. I wish you to keep this in mind.
 People ask me, ‘What will be the outcome of this satyagraha? All types of people, good, bad and indifferent, have joined it. Even cheats and rogues are courting arrest in the name of satyagraha.’ I know there is not a single province where undesirable men have not courted arrest. But I also know that there is not a single province where people who measure up to my standards have not gone to jail. That is why I have not launched a mass movement. If I launch a mass movement, people may perhaps jump into it. What will the British do in that case? They will enact another Jallianwala Bagh. I am not afraid of it, but I do not want to give them an opportunity to do so. If we remain strictly non-violent and then they force a Jallianwala upon us, I could not care less.
 But I say once again that it will be a good omen for India if even a handful of men whom we know to be true remain steadfast to their pledge. That will pave the way for an all-out  non-violent struggle.
 All this needs an element of honesty. It is a primary condition. Those Congressmen who have to faith in khadi, who decry untouchability in public but observe it in their homes, who, being Hindus, hate the Muslims, or who, being Muslims, hate the non- Muslims, do not deserve to be satyagrahis. Such persons cannot help our cause even by going to jail. They are like thieves and dacoits who also go to jail. They are not satyagrahis but only law-breakers. They cannot produce any wholesome results. Why should they go to jail disrupting their homes and forgoing their income? We wish that only a handful of satyagrahis should go to jail; but their conduct should be such as to produce a moral effect.
 
 Civil disobedience is a powerful weapon. But for employing it, we must  fulfil  the  thirteen-point  constructive  programmelibtech_274_footnotewhich  I have outlined. Till then this weapon cannot be effective. I know that the crores of people in India cannot court arrest. Nor is that necessary. But it is essential that crores of people should have faith in the constructive programme. Khadi is the pivot of the constructive programme. It is essential that crores of people should wear khadi; they should not wear foreign or mill-made cloth and they should not observe any untouchability. If they are not prepared to do even this, how can freedom be won through ahimsa? What right do they have to desire freedom, who are not prepared to take even a little trouble?
 If we wish to win swaraj through ahimsa, this is the only way. If, however, we wish to use force, then Hitler would point the way. There are only two courses open—either Hitler’s, that is, the way of violence, or mine, that is, the way of non-violence. Hitlerism and Churchillism are in fact the same thing. The difference of only one of degree.
 By presenting this yarn and this money to me, you are telling me that you do not want to tread the path of violence. It is my belief that a time will come when everyone in India will realize that the only correct course is to follow ahimsa. The day is soon arriving for khadi when the entire country will be convinced that any cloth other than khadi must be discarded. I shall utilize all the money I have received on the occasion of Khadi Jayanti for encouraging khadi. People ask me, ‘Why do you not ulitize this money for Congress work?’ In a way khadi work is also Congress work. But it is only the parliamentary programme or the movement against the Government that people regard as Congress work. This is a wrong notion. This amount will be utilized only for khadi work.
 It is to be considered how this money received from the three divisions of the Central Provinces is to be utilized for the purposes of khadi. These three divisions may jointly or separately send schemes for their areas. Jajujilibtech_275_footnotewill welcome and give them due consideration. If we do not accept these schemes, we shall give reasons for rejecting them.
 Many people send yarn to me by post. I do not understand why they do so. The amount spent on postage is more than the value of the
 
 yarn. I wish people would send me ready-made khadi. Even from the jail they should send khadi woven out of yarn spun by them. Today people ply the charkha. But I wish that they learn operating the handloom. They should send me woven khadi. I do not need khadi for myself. I have enough khadi for my personl use. Hence it would be all right if people weave khadi and send it to the Charkha Sangh of their own Province, though, from one point of view, it is better to sent it to me so that I may know how the work is progressing from year to year both in quantity as well as in quality. As years pass the quality of our yarn should improve. But they should not pay railway freight in sending the yarn to me. Only khadi should reach me. It would be enough if just a specimen is sent to me.
All of us should devote greater energy and talent to khadi work.
This can be done even in jail.
 Those who have been to prison once have to go there again and again. There is no question of going back. It does not mean that we shall do so indiscriminately. We shall have to use our discretion. How can we send to prison again a person whose health has been shattered during imprisonment in spite of the best efforts? It will be a kind of violence.
 Some people ask me : ‘Why should the same persons go to jail again and again? Why not select new men so that the satyagraha continues without causing much strain?’ I have already said that a non-violent war has its own strategy. We cannot follow Hitlerian tactics. A barbaric war is being fought in Europe with large-scale massacres. Young, old, even invalids, are being annihilated. Even barbaric war demands sacrifices. In a non-violent war there is  no scope for sacrifices on such a gigantic scale. Here we seek to employ moral pressure. This will entail sacrifices on the part of a select few. We have not been called upon to make any great sacrifices till now. What are our sacrifices worth if we are not prepared to face even the hardship of prison life time and again?
 There is one other question. Should we carry on the struggle within the four walls of the prison? Many problems arise there also. The matter of A, B and C classes creates much bitterness. What should we do there? These classes are a creation of Congressmen themselves. I am convinced that these classes will ultimately be abolished. In the mean time, there is much scope for improvement in the diet of C class prisoners. I have already said that doctors can bring about the much-
 
 needed improvement in this matter if they so desire. But granting that the doctors cannot do anything, even then this struggle will have to continue. The satyagrahis will repeatedly go to prison. Prison life will be full of hardships. It will mean starvation and even if it causes death in some cases I shall be prepared to face that eventuality. We should all be ready for it.
 We have simply on other course open to us. Our war demands sacrifices, hardships and suffering. That is how the war of ahimsa is waged.

     DEAR 	DR. MOOKERJI, I 	thank you for your letter.  October 	13, 1941 
  	Supposing Christians as such wanted to get rid of some social abuse 	and established an association for dealing with it, I should think 	they would restrict admission to fellow-Christians only. If you 	admit this, you will appreciate the restriction in Harijan Sevak 	Sangh. Hindus have sinned and they must purge themselves. The others 	can extend their sympathy but cannot do repentance. Of course, there 	is untouchability among Christians and Muslims, thanks to the highly 	infectious disease in the Hindu body. Hindus can only help the 	latter by completely curing themselves of the disease, but the rest 	has to be dealt with by the respective communities.  	The obvious is being missed because of the political results. But 	the root of the evil is in the corruption of religion. If this is 	not clear, you should pursue the subject, till at least we agree as 	to the results. I 	hope your wife is well. Of course, you will come when you 
 can.         From 	a copy : C.W. 7865. Courtesy : G. D. Birla       Yours 	sincerely,  K. GANDHI

I would like it if all get khadi 	made out of their own yarn. Like spinning-wheels, looms too should 	be introduced in jails on which to weave the hand-spun yarn. This 	can be done easily.  Blessings 	from  BAPU [PS.] All 	should learn Urdu and Hindi scripts and also learn to employ 	both these forms in their speech.  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 2483

 [October 14, 1941]libtech_286_footnote
 In view of your very delicate condition and the uncertainty of the period of treatment, I am quite clear that your re-offering civil disobedience should be indefinitely postponed and that you should give yourself complete rest and follow your medical adviser’s instructions.

  	Your letter. Of course you should not worry Shummylibtech_287_footnoteuntil you are uniformly well for at least a 	fortnight. There need be no hurry to leave the place so long as the 	weather there agrees with you.  	We have here a homoeopath. He is a crank like me. I have entrusted 	Prabhakar to his care. He took charge yesterday and P. is distinctly 	better today. As you know I have little faith in h’pathy, though I 	would like to for its comparative simplicity.  	Love.

     DEAR 	NARAYANASWAMY,  October 	14, 1941 
  	I was glad to have your letter and to note that in the end you began 	to like the Ashram and its people. You 	will come with your wife whenever you like.     
 There is very little difference between your socialism and mine as you subscribe so whole-heartedly to non-violence and the constructive programme.
 I am organizing village along the constructive line but I don’t mix with it the political programme so called. The two will not blend, though those working both are Congressmen. The constructive progrmme is complete in itself.

 BHAI MAGANLAL,
 Only now I could get time to read your letter of the 20th. I cannot reach and deal with all letters in time. What can be the value of my opinion now? I will state it, however. Let the friends take the pledge if they wish. I have discovered from bitter experience that they do not know the meaning of a pledge. Perhaps the best course would be to remain in contact with them and be content with whatever they do.

         CHI. 	SUSHILA,   LETTER TO SUSHILA NAYYAR   October 	14, 1941 
  	Yesterday I wrote the letter to you in the midst of a big crowd. 	Today I am observing silence for an hour before mailing time and 	taking the opportunity to write this letter. Yesterday 	with great difficulty Prithvi Chand, Girdhari and 
 Mahmud met Pyarelal. They had given no intimation beforehand. Pyarelal was very happy. Prithvi Chand will give you a full account when he comes. He has said that Sushila must not come to Sevagram before her examination. Mother should not come to visit him if she is not going to stay at Sevagram. He wants to meet Mahadev. The rest through Prithvi Chand. I have come to the conclusion that Pyarelal wishes that Mother should come here to stay. I have not yet met Prithvi Chand. Girdhari mentioned the matter to me. Prithvi Chand has gone to Wardha.
 Prabhakar is very seriously ill. He is coughing very much. His morning temperature is 99° and it goes up to 103° every day. Today a homoeopath has come here and I have allowed him to take his medicine.

  	As you are constantly in my thoughts, I dreamt about you  though I 	rarely dream. This letter is prompted by that dream. It occurred 	three days ago, but it is only today that I got the time to write.  	Rearing a baby requires as much care as carrying it. The quality of 	your milk will depend on your diet and your way of living. As the 	food you eat will affect the quality of your milk, so also will your       
 temper and your thoughts. Please take my word for this, for I am writing it from personal observation. You should, therefore, make it a point to eat food only as medicine, and not to please your palate. The relish which one gets from this ‘medicine’ is true relish and is nourishing. Do not understand the word ‘medicine’ in its strict dictionary sense and be repelled by it. Milk can be taken both as medicine and for the pleasure of the palate. The first way of taking it will nourish the body and the second will harm it. The baby should get proper exercise, fresh air, massage, etc. Do not listen to anybody else in this matter. Many people will want to pamper the baby. But whatever they might say, remain firm in your resolution.
 This was the idea behind my dream. I hope you are in good health and that the baby is growing well. I hope Mother and you do not quarrel and that you do not cry. After you have left childbed you should, I think, stay here for a month of so.
 Blessings from

From your previous letter I read a different 	meaning from what I read in your letter. I have now asked Kanulibtech_313_footnotelibtech_314_footnoteto 	go to you. His love for Abhalibtech_315_footnoteis still there. But he realizes that he erred and has 	therefore resigned himself to forfeiture of Abha’s hand. If you 	and your wife wish and Abha is eager to marry Kanu, then and then 	only should she come to me. If she comes you have to forget her for 	the time being as you have Sailenlibtech_316_footnotelibtech_317_footnoteand 	Dhirenlibtech_318_footnotetill 	they  have finished their course and are on their way to earning 	their bread. Abha will be trained here and will be sent to Rajkot 	too, if I pass her. If both restrain themselves and Abha still likes 	Kanu and likes his parents and surroundings and keeps her health, 	she will be married to Kanu. So far as I can see both will have to 	wait for two years before              
 marriage. If all this does not commend itself to you, your wife or Abha, she should not come and you should train her there and do what you think best. I would not take it ill, if she does not come. All I want is her welfare and [to] fit her for marriage. [If] you all and she are desirous that she should marry Kanu, you should talk frankly to Kanu. If she decides to come and if you are agreeable, you may send her with Kanu.
I am glad you are all well now.
 Don’t expect anything from Sailen now. I hope to prepare them both as early as possible and so I have disengaged them from Ashram work.

 I see no harm in their selecting Nanabhailibtech_326_footnoteas President instead of you. Accept whatever office they give and acquit yourself well. You should learn the art of working in an organization. When you feel that the work itself is suffering and conflicts are increasing, you may  resign in a spirit of humility.

However, after duly thinking over all this, do only what you think proper. I have faith in your judgment.

  	Received the letter signed by you and the other teachers. The 	restrictions are imposed on teachers of Government schools mainly 	with the object of preserving the authority of the Government. This 	I think is sufficient reason for quitting Government service. But if 	you want to continue in it, truthfulness lies in following 	Government rules as long as the fetters are not removed as a result 	of the freedom movement.  	There must be regulations in non-governmental national institutions 	also. Teachers should have a say in formulating them. It is up to 	the teachers to continue or not to continue in the service of such 	institutions. The propriety or impropriety of their regulations can 	be judged only after scrutinizing them.

  	I have read both the books carefully. I think they would rank high 	among the existing text-books. But I have not been able to convince 	others of my view. You may remember the preface to my efforts in 	this field. I had said that my attempt was not to add one more book 	to the number of many good books. I wanted one book to replace all 	the others for that standard. I stick to my view even  now. But I 	see that it will not hold at the moment. If anyone from among our 	teachers succeeds in such an enterprise, he may lead the way. I want 	to prize open the minds of millions. I do believe they must open up. 	Knowledge of the alphabet develops the intelligence but little. 	Rather, it thwarts the development. And it costs a great deal, as I 	do. From that angle these two books do not make the grade. The 	illustrations are comparatively good but need much improvement.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a copy of the Gujarati : Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy : Pyarelal

  STATEMENT TO THE PRESS 
 
 WARDHAGANJ,
 
  October 	21, 1941  	The publication of the statement attributed to Shri Jayaprakash 	Narayan, which he is stated to have attempted to smuggle from his 	place of detention, does not, so far as I can see, lead us 	anywhere.libtech_335_footnoteIf 	the motive was to discredit the organization of which Jayaprakash 	Narayan is a distinguished member, it must fail.  	Assuming the correctness of the charge against Jayaprakash Narayan, 	the method advocated by him is against the policy of truth and 	non-violence adopted by the Congress, and he deserves  the severest 	condemnation. But it ill becomes the  Government to condemn or 	discredit it. Frankly, all nationalist forces, no matter by what 	name they are described, are at war with the Government. And, 	according to the accepted canons of war, the method adopted by 	Jayaprakash Narayan is perfectly legitimate. He has had his training 	in America for seven long years and is a student of the methods 	adopted by Western nations in their fight for freedom. To practise 	deception, to resort to secret methods and even to plot murder, are 	all honourable and turn the perpetrators into national heroes. Are 	not Clive and Warren Hastings British heroes? If Jayaprakash Narayan 	was in the British Diplomatic Service and by secret diplomacy  	achieved something of importance, he would be covered with 	distinction.  	The sensation with which the event has been disclosed to the Indian 	world is ill-conceived. The annotations in the communique are 	probably wholly unwarranted. When it is borne in mind that 	Jayaprakash Narayan is an untried detenu, the annotations look very 	like hitting below the belt. The Government should have shown 	Jayaprakash the document or documents seized, and published his 	answer if he had any to give.  	The way in which his poor wife has been dragged in is unfortunate. 	She knew nothing of the attempt, for it was frustrated    
 before anything could reach her. I may inform the public that Prabhavati does not share Jayaprakash Narayan’s views. She was put under my charge by her parents when she was not yet fifteen and while her husband Jayaprakash was still in America. She has wholly accepted my view of Indian politics and is one of my most faithful co- workers. As husband and wife, Jayaprakash Narayan and Prabhavati Devi are an ideal couple. Jayaprakash has never sought to impose his views on Prabhavati. He has never prevented her from freely coming to me. Indeed, he has encouraged her to come to me whenever she has been ill. She has never been taken into the secrets of the Socialist Party. The alleged communication has completely upset her, for she never thought that her husband would advocate the method attributed to him.
 The suggestion made in some newspapers that the restrictions on prisoners should be tightened is wholly irrelevant to Jayaprakash Narayan’s attempt. That it was frustrated is enough proof of the efficiency of the C. I. D. Even if there is laxity, it can be no warrant for giving them bad or insufficient food, or keeping them in places far away from their homes, making it difficult or expensive for relatives to visit detenus. I have read Shri N. M. Joshi’s very careful and over-moderate recommendationslibtech_336_footnoteabout the Deoli Camp. I have learnt enough about it to enable me to say, in the name of humanity, that the Camp should be disbanded and the prisoners should be sent nearer their homes. It is wrong, from every point of view, to bring prisoners from their provinces and concentrate them in a place where there is no facility either of provisions or medical assistance or other amenities of life. Prisoners of war are treated like princes compared to political prisoners, whose status would be any day superior to that of prisoners of war.
 One word to Congressmen. While Jayaprakash Narayan remains the patriot we have known him, they must realize that his method is harmful in the extreme while a non-violent struggle is going on. I have said, repeatedly, that secrecy has no place in a non-violent organization. No underhand or underground movement can ever become a mass movement or stir millions to mass action. I am glad, therefore, that Shri Purshottam Tricumdas, Secretary of the Socialist
 
 Party, has repudiated the method said to be advocated by Jayaprakash Narayan. Indeed, I would appeal to Jayaprakash  Narayan  to reconsider his philosophy and, if his reason can approve, to repudiate the method as a lapse from sound reason and the loyalty he owes to the Congress. What he has stigmatized as a farce of satyagraha is not a farce. It is the fine fruit of mature experience of thirty-three years’ experimenting in truth and non-violence; and, if God wills it, I hope to demonstrate that from this farce will rise a reality which will compel admission even by Jayaprakash Narayan and those who think with him. Jayaprakash did not indeed go to prison as a satyagrahi,libtech_337_footnotelibtech_338_footnotebut he has not ceased to be a member of the Congress, and so it is not proper for him and others who think with him to retard the movement by their action, which is admittedly disloyal to the Congress.

  LETTER TO AGATHA HARRISON 
 October 22, 1941
 MY DEAR AGATHA,
 I have kept by me your letter of 15th July. I did not know what to say nor do I know now. I understand your earnestness and grief. But I do not know how to console you. However detached you may try to be, you cannot but be influenced by your surroundings. It is equally true of me, not to talk of others. Add to this the difficulty of answering in the middle of October a letter written in the middle of July. And this when every day means new history. I have therefore the greatest reluctance even to write to you in spite of the pleasure it gives me to write to you. But I must try.
 Distrust of the Rulers is growing and spreading. The distance is increasing. We here perceive no difference between Hitlerism and British Imperialism. Hitlerism is a superfine copy of Imperialism and Imperialism is trying to overtake Hitlerism as fast as  it  can. Democracy is nowhere. In this unholy duel, so far as I can see, non- violence is working its way in a silent but sure manner. My fatih in it is daily growing stronger. Whether as Polak says, and as you almost hint,libtech_341_footnoteI think, in your most gentle manner, it can stand the strain if bombs were dropping near my feet and I was witnessing dear ones being crushed to death, I cannot say. I rehearse such situations, I pray that the faith might not break under such strain. I flatter myself with the belief that I can feel these things from afar. I did shed a silent tear when I read about the damage done to the Houses of Parliament, the Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s. Nevertheless this is all speculation. If I fail in the examination, if it ever came to me, I shall have the courage to admit my weakness but I will not deny my faith in non- violence.
 Of communal unity there is no immediate hope, though  I believe that it will come sooner than we expect. But that will bring no settlement with the British Government. In their declarations there are many impossible conditions. One is that we must get the Princes also to agree. Now the Princes mean the British  Government,  for  the former are the latter’s creation and they cannot even talk openly with
 
 
 anybody but by the latter’s consent.
 The Rulers feel a sense of security in the existing situation. The Princes obedient, the Muslim League showing its harmless teeth, and the Congress led by me following its equally harmless Civil Disobedience. They find no difficulty in squeezing the last pice and getting as many recruits as they want.
 Can you now have a glimpse of why you find endless difficulties in the pursuit of your thankless task? But you must . . .libtech_342_footnoteIt is never wasted if it is sown in cultivable soil.
 My own and hence the Congress method is incredibly simple. Its token Civil Disobedience must continue. It will blaze forth when the question of embarrassment disappears. The Congress is ready for any honourable compromise with any party including the Rulers, consistently with its fundamentals. Nothing short of Complete Independence can be acceptable to the Congress.  The Congress cannot be party to the war efforts and therefore cannot take office. But Civil Disobedience can be stopped if free speech consistently with non-violence is recognized and all political prisoners are unconditionally discharged. This excludes those who have been tried and found guilty of actual violence unless they repent. It includes all untried men. So far as I can see, the Congress will not change its policy so long as I am alive and well enough to think clearly and advise. There is no one who has any sympathy with Nazism  or Fascism but there is no one who has any sympathy for Imperialism [either], not even the recruits who hire themselves out for the sake of bread. Some join because they want military training at any cost.
Now you have a picture as true as I can draw of India to date.
 My advice is don’t worry, don’t fret. You need not write, need not speak, unless you feel an irresistible impulse. Let prayer of the heart be our sole and sure refuge. It is enough to realize that not a blade moves but by His will. He allows this slaughter. We do not know why. But if we keep our hands, head and heart stainless let us believe that in His own good time, He will use us to stop this apparently senseless mutual slaughter.
 Amrit is not with me for the moment. She is in Simla resting. Indira is resting in Mussoorie and keeping fairly well. Padmajalibtech_343_footnoteis in
 
 Hyderabad. She is chronically ill.
 I have in mind Andrews constantly. I will not rest till I have finished the Memorial work. Please send my love to his sisters.

  LETTER TO SHARDA G. CHOKHAWALA 
 [October 22, 1941]libtech_345_footnote
 CHI. BABUDI,
 Why do you fall ill? If your diet is correct and you have enough fresh air nothing should happen. Do you drink water after boiling it? Do you know how to recite Ramanama?
        From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : S. G. 128     SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_346_footnote   Blessings 	from  BAPU         SEVAGRAM, 
  October 	22, 1941  	As regards diet, I am quite convinced that the food cooked in the 	Ashram kitchen would, with slight adjustments, be suitable for the 	people in Sevagram also. The food served at the Khadi Vidyalaya or 	to C class prisoners would not do. The standard of food prepared in 	our kitchen here would be found suitable. In this regard we have 	taken into consideration the opinions of doctors all over India and 	we consult them even now. At the Ashram we can protect ourselves 	from a number of diseases. Whatever illness persists is due to the 	fact that all of us are not frugal eaters.     
 Everyone must get two 1b. of milk, two tolas of ghee and two- and-a-half tolas of butter daily. Vegetables such as we have here are also essential for everybody. Perhaps in the case of those who do physical labour it may be necessary to increase the quantity of grain; they may need dal too, though we do not use it in our kitchen. But the quantity of milk and butter we take can be reduced to some extent. Skimmed milk can and ought to be used in our kitchen. It is wrong in  a way not to use it. It has everything except ghee and it is cheaper too. We certainly want to reduce the cost of our diet.  Skimmed  milk should suffice for our villagers. They must have some fruit too. At present they get no fruit at all, though they may have some sort of mangoes during the season. They should have fruit in the same proportion as we have for the Ashram inmates. Tamarind, lemons and tomatoes are essential for them. They can manage with them. They may also require some spices, though we do not have them in the Ashram and according to me they are not at all necessary. But I do not believe that spices have no place in our villagers’ diet. They can have some vitamins from the spices also. But spices cannot take the place of milk as some people mistakenly believe. I have found that the body grows weak and health deteriorates by the excessive use  of spices. This will provide you some basis for calculating  the expenditure on food.
 The second necessity is clothing. The loin-cloth such as I wear is not meant for everybody and it is not necessary for all to adopt it. Kurta, short dhoti and cap should suffice for men.
 The women’s dress in the Ashram has been rather strange. I am of the opinion, however, that the dress of the women of the Punjab is the most suitable. What Amtul Salaam sometimes wears would be, with some modifications, very good. There is art in the kurta, dupatta and shalwar of the Punjab and in these every part of a woman’s body can be properly covered. Mirabehn has nicely adapted it for herself. The dupatta is artistic and at the same time very useful and comfortable during winter. The kurta covers the woman’s body fully, the shalwar also is a complete dress in itself and lends the wearer grace. The ghaghra is an absolutely inadequate dress and should never be worn without an under-wear. If we could not adopt a uniform dress even for the women in the Ashram, it is a very difficult proposition to do so for the whole of India. There is great scope for improvement in the present dress of [our] women. But I am not particularly bothered
 about this. For the present it would suffice if we made our dresses entirely out of khadi.
 These days people huddle together and sleep in the same room which is sometimes also shared by their cattle. It keeps them warm but it is bad for their health, with the result that the mortality rate in India is the highest. People will enjoy better health if they sleep in the open. This will be possible only when they have sufficient clothing to cover themselves as we have in the Ashram. Everyone must have at least a blanket and a heavy sheet of khadi. People in the Ashram try to use quilt-covers by stuffing them with paper but they become useless during the rains. One does not, however, have to spend a lot on it. Greater expenditure is needed on diet.
 Thirdly, we have the housing problem. Here we must first decide how much shelter is required per head. Houses can be built with grass, mud and stalks. At present it is not so in the Ashram. I have allowed houses to be built with bricks but pucca houses are not essential in the villages. They are costly. Thatched mud houses would do in the villages. Even as it is, rain water floods even our houses and we are faced with the problem of saving people from it. Everybody should protect his own house. I see no difficulty in it. Perhaps for years to come the country cannot reach my ideal of housing. I agree that houses in the Ashram are ideal houses. In order to determine the ideal we will have to decide upon the covered area required per head. It is however essential to provide separate shelter for the cattle. At present people in Sevagram keep their cattle also in the house itself. Their houses have poor sanitation. They don’t have enough room for the children. Their houses should be so constructed as to admit plenty of fresh air and light. Though the houses in the Ashram are poor dwellings even the rich can live comfortably in them. The villages also should have such houses. Today this is not the case but if the villagers co-operate with us the situation can be improved to a great extent.
 What I have said to you today is a matter of great importance. I agree we cannot achieve complete success in the countryside unless we have the reins of government in our hands. But if our dedication and service attain a high degree of perfection we shall not have to depend on the Government and a great many things can be done even without it.
 The villagers should co-operate with one another in regard to their cattle. We should first find out the number of cattle in the village,
 and decide whether all of them are needed or we can do with less by managing them on a co-operative basis. For instance, I do  not  consider it proper for every villager to own a bullock-cart. Can’t we manage with much fewer bullock-carts if we follow the co-operative method? The same thing applies to oxen and a number of other things. The villagers can make much more profit if they have a co- operative society for selling their grain. The cattle of the entire village can likewise be accommodated on a contributory basis. The villagers can make great progress if they work like this in co-operation with one another. Ours is a small village. We should inquire and find out in which spheres of activity and to what extent we can work on a co- operative basis. Even if all villagers are not inclined to follow the co- operative method we must find out those who are prepared to give it a trial.
 Similarly, we should adopt the co-operative method in farming too. The entire produce of the village should be distributed only among those who have laboured for it. This does not mean that the labour put in will not be taken into account. A proper account of the labour put in by each individual will have to be maintained.
 We should also decide about the crops we want to raise. Those things which are essential for Sevagram should be given priority. Cultivation for purposes of sale should be kept to the minimum. We have been carrying on trade to some extent since the olden times and shall continue to do so within India as well as with foreign countries. I shall not speak about other countries. Let us consider what we can do here.
 We should produce all the other necessities in the village itself. Then we should also find out what other industries we can set up here. We ought to press oil and make shoes locally. Similarly we can think of other industries also.
 You should decide what it is that you want to give priority to. It is for you to examine all the aspects of farming. I myself have not gone deep into this aspect and therefore am not at  present  in  a position to guide you in this regard.
 We have to think about education in Sevagram. Though you have not asked me any question on this, I may at least tell you that in my opinion there should not be a single illiterate person in Sevagram. I put forward the concept of basic education very late in my life but all the same I attach great importance to it. I had put the following
 question before the Gujarati Sahitya Parishadlibtech_347_footnote: What kind of literature are the writers bringing out for the crores of illiterate villagers? This task is as huge as it is difficult.
 Let me also tell you that our own life, if it is simple and pure, is bound to have its impact on the villagers without our having to tell them in so many words. It is not our way to argue. All our personal conduct should be well regulated and must conform to our ideal. We have enough land in the Ashram and we can cultivate it as a model farm. If I want, I can have the entire land in the village bought up but  I have forbidden further purchase of land for the time being and, until  I am able to distribute the entire proceeds among the tillers of the soil, I do not want to purchase more land. I must ask you for the present to set through the Ashram an example of ideal farming. They will then try to follow it of their own accord. At present farming in the Ashram is not as it should be and we are far behind the ideal. Our expenditure too is excessive and we must remedy this situation. We shall make steady progress only when we persistently direct all our experiments towards our ideal. I want you to associate the Ashram women also with your experiments. They will be of great help to you. You won’t be able to do without them; besides, they have to be trained for this work.
 Thus Sevagram will become a sort of republic. You may appoint some person as your leader for a few years but later you will be able to do without him, for a republic has no place for a leader. People know one another closely, unlike what we find in the elections where millions of voters don’t even know who the candidate is. A popular leader cannot suppress the people. We had some such institution in the olden days. But the British destroyed everything. They are trying to suppress the villagers through their military strength. Once this force loses its grip, there will be no place for the police, the village headman, the patwari and the like. Only the toughs will remain. But the people can take care of them.
 Unless we do this we shall not attain the ideal social order based on truth and ahimsa. I am convinced that a non-violent society can be built only on the foundation of harmony and co-operation, without which society is bound to remain violent. If we argue that this cannot be done it will mean that a non-violent society can never come into being. In that case our entire culture would be meaningless. How can
 
 
 we call this ideal an impossibility while professing faith in human nature? Of course it presupposes ahimsa of a high order.
 The ahmisa required for driving the British out of India need not be of so high a quality; but the steps we shall have to take to cleanse our own hearts cannot be taken without ahimsa of a very high order. For instance, the Hindu-Muslim tension cannot be removed without true ahimsa. We followed the path of ahimsa to face  the British because we had no violent force. This was not true ahimsa. Ahimsa dwells not in the hearts of the cowards but in the hearts of the brave. The Negroes are physically robust, their chests are worth admiration but the British have filled them with fear, so much so that a sturdy Negro trembles at the sight of a white child. The same is the plight of the Indians. Although in physical strength, we are nothing compared to the Negroes, our experiments, imperfect as they are, in ahimsa have had a profound impact.
 My faith in human nature is progressively growing. I have concluded, on the basis of my experiments, that human nature can be easily moulded. We have come to assume, because of our inertia, that human nature is always the same and seldom amenable to progress. Churchill and Hitler are striving to change the nature of  their respective countrymen by forcing and hammering violent methods on them. Man may be suppressed in this manner but he cannot be changed. Ahimsa, on the other hand, can change human nature and sooner than men like Churchill and Hitler can.
 If you can digest what I have said to you today and if you acquire the strength to act accordingly, I shall be saying many more things. Discuss fully all this amongst yourselves and put up before me a definite scheme of what you can do. I shall answer all your doubts from time to time. Today I have talked to you at great length and some of the things I have said to you are not only new but also very vital. You should try to digest them before asking me any questions, for otherwise your questions will lack the force of careful thinking.

  AN ERROR 
 The khadi movement, I find, has gone on for more than 21 years. But while on the one hand we do not have a sufficient number of weavers, on the other the millions of idle weavers in India do not use our yarn for weaving. Is it any error on our part which leads to this double failure? I shall try to answer this question today.
 I am of the opinion that this is but the result of our own folly. If  I were to find fault with anyone in this effort it could be only myself. When I placed khadi on such a high pedestal I should have considered all aspects of the problem. However, many vital things were first revealed to me in their generality and the finer details were only gradually worked out. The fact that spinning involves carding was discovered only through experience. The process of ginning cotton came to light only later. I knew that the yarn would have to be woven but I had not imagined then that it would be a difficult process. Even when I knew it I did not clearly see the solution as I see it now. The solution is that khadi workers must learn the process of weaving even as a matter of atonement. The best of our spinners have come from the same class. That is how we could make good progress in spinning. In the same manner we should have made weaving compulsory for the khadi workers. When we learn this art we shall fully understand the weavers’ difficulties in using hand-spun yarn. Only then can we find a remedy for the difficulties and the professional weavers will follow us in using hand-spun yarn. Not that I had never thought of this. The work of weaving hand-spun yarn was first started long ago by the late Maganlal Gandhi and by Manilal Gandhi. But I did not insist that everyone or certain people must weave, as I used to insist that they must spin. As a result of this error the process of weaving has not been as widely taken up by khadi workers as it should have been. I am of the opinion that one among every five, seven or ten spinners must become a good weaver. Weaving cannot be done by one man. One needs a companion for fixing the warp and for sizing. One also needs the help of a boy or a girl to load the shuttle. Any-one can handle these processes as also the actual weaving on the loom. But what I propose is that a certain proportion should become experts. This will lead to great progress. It is not necessary to tell me that this is already the practice at some centres. My complaint is that I have not systematically insisted that one loom must operate where there are, say, five, seven or ten spinners. Had I so insisted I would have got
 
 today not yarn but woven goods. The large number of satyagrahis in the prisons would not have been content with merely plying the charkha but would have had a loom and woven their yarn.
 Weaving includes tapes, webbing, towels and coarse khadi as well as the fine dhotis or saris from Andhra with elaborately woven  patterns. When the processes of weaving all these items are present in our minds we shall not waste a single stretch of yarn. We shall classify the different varieties of yarn, and weave them into appropriate cloth. This error has also led to a lot of waste. We used to throw away broken yarn as so much waste. I know that many of the basic schools have begun taking care to avoid such waste. We have to spread this knowledge. This is just the beginning of basic education. In fact it is the primary function of basic education to give thought to these problems, to investigate them scientifically and to suggest reform accordingly.
 The most unfortunate result of this error has been our failure to enlist every weaver for our movement. Why can we not approach the weaver with hand-spun yarn instead of mill-made yarn? If we acknowledge our error and atone for it, there would be such a great improvement in hand-spun yarn that it could compete with mill-made yarn. Perhaps it may not be possible to spin by hand as fine yarn as the mills can produce. However, there need not be this vast difference between the two and the weaver need not have scorn on his face, as he now has, at the sight of hand-spun yarn.

 I have your letter. Your present visit cannot be said to be successful. But who knows what would have happened if you had remained here? Never think about the future. When I see that your life is a burden [on others] I will not have the slightest hesitation in saying so, but as long as your intellect is clear I will not say that. For a person whose intellect is clear and whose aspirations are pure can never be a burden. The thoughts of such a man have a power not to be found in his actions. Just as speech limits thought, so also action limits aspirations. But now we shall meet soon. Let me know the exact date.

   STATEMENT TO THE PRESS       SEVAGRAM, 
  October 28, 1941 I have 	been chary of issuing statements for the guidance of satyagrahis. 	The deciding reason has been to have them to be self- guided 	where they are not guided by local leaders. But this chariness  	can easily be overdone. Time seems to have arrived for a brief 	review especially as several leaders who have been discharged have 	met me and there has been much speculation about the trend or the 	result of these talks. The public should know that those who were 	not whole- heartedly  with  the  Bombay  Resolutionlibtech_371_footnotelibtech_372_footnotehave 	 come  out   with  their doubts confirmed. Similarly those who never 	had any doubts have become firmer than ever before in their opinion. 	As for me I never had any doubt as to the correctness of the Bombay 	Resolution and have none about the correctness of the steps hitherto 	taken in pursuance thereof. If I had, I could not, would not, have 	led a fight involving not only the fate of the Congress but even of 	the nation as a whole. There is one saving grace in non-violent 	action. Unlike violent action, it being good in itself can never do 	real harm.     
 Complaints reach me (1) that there is marked deterioration in enthusiasm; (2) that fewer people are coming forward now  than before; (3) that those who are discharged are not seeking impriso- nment again; (4) that there is no discipline among many satyagrahi prisoners some of whom have no notion of non-violence or truth; (5) that the treatment of C class prisoners is inhuman in that the food given is bad in quality and deficient in balance. The result is that the majority of prisoners have suffered in health, making it impossible for many on discharge to seek imprisonment again without adequate rest and repair. There are too complaints about want of newspapers, books and proper sanitation; (6) that the policy of non-embarrassment is unintelligible, as the Rulers themselves do not appreciate it, and the fight therefore should be intensified without regard to embarrassment;
  that 	there is no life 	left in the 	Congress—there are 	no meetings, 	there are 	no demonstrations, no 	other activity, and 	that there should be 	 a change 	of policy 	and programme 	even resulting 	in the 	resumption of 	full parliamentary 	programme, including ministries, i.e., 	reversion to the Poona offerlibtech_373_footnotelibtech_374_footnotewith suitable modification. 
 (1 & 2) I shall consider the first two together. Enthusiasm that is froth is of no use in non-violent action. Showy demonstrations and the like have a value in the initial stages. Continuous feverish activity can only promote violence and therefore retard the steady march of non-violent action, call it battle, if that word is preferred. That fewer are coming forward is but natural. For it must be recalled that civil disobedience is individual and restricted to representatives, be they even  elected  members  of  village  or  firkalibtech_375_footnotelibtech_376_footnotecommittee.   The   list  of representatives being limited it must one day be exhausted. I have no doubt that if I made a general call and relaxed the conditions of enrollment I should be overwhelmed by applications. I have no machinery to examine such applications. In reality it will be mass action which does not admit of individual examination and choice. That call will not come before the close of the war. There is neither warrant nor atmosphere for mass action. That would be naked embarrassment and a betrayal of non-violence. What is more it can
 
 vide “Statement to the Press”, 15-6-1941.
 never lead to independence. Mass action at this stage without communal unity is an invitation to civil war. If civil war is to be our lot, it will come, but if I know the Congress mind, it will never come at the wish or invitation of the Congress.
   This 		complaint is partially 		valid. It is true 		that some of those 		who have been 		discharged are 		reluctant to 		go back. This 		is a 		novel experience 		for India. I 		had to 		do it in South Africa. 		The struggle 		demanded it 		there as 		it now does here. 		Self-suffering has 		no limit. 		In the 		former civil 		disobedience the 		occasion had 		not come to 		send the 		same resisters to jail 		again and 		again. In the 		present one 		it is inevitable. Any 		other course would 		reduce the struggle 		to a farce. 		The alternative 		suggested is that 		substitutes should be 		found for 		those who 		would not 		go in again. 		Surely that is 		not the way of 		suffering. And 		how can we 		think of 		gaining independence 		without a full 		measure of 		suffering? The 		greater the 		cause the 		richer the 		suffering. Therefore in 		this struggle they 		only will count who 		will seek imprisonment 		again and 		again, come what will. 		They may be 		very few. That will 		not matter. Of 		course those who 		are ill will naturally 		not be 		required to 		go till they are restored. Some have interpreted literally my statementlibtech_377_footnotethat the 		discharged satyagrahis 		may take 		about a week 		before they go. Each 		case has to 		be judged on 		merits. Shri Vinoba 		went in twice within 		72 hours 		of his 		discharge. He 		had to 		come to 		me before reoffering 		civil disobedience. 		Hence even 		that little delay.  		Shri Pyarelal 		took nearly 		a month 		before going in for 		the third time. There 		were unavoidable causes 		which need not occupy 		the reader’s 		time and attention. 		I have mentioned 		two cases which I was 		personally regulating. 		They exemplify 		the elasticity 		I refer 		to. There 		is no shame 		or harm in 		unavoidable delay. 		Hypocrisy and 		camouflage must 		be avoided 		at all 		cost. In satyagraha 		there is 		no waste of 		men or 		time or labour, provided 		that Satya 		is adhered 		to in its entirety. 		 I  can otherwise 		utilize the services, 		as true 		soldiers of 		truth, of 		men and 		women who 		will whole-heartedly 		carry out 		instructions. Thus 		those who 		cannot for 		some just reason court 		imprisonment should 		engage themselves 		in corporate 		constructive activity. Difficulty arises because 		many Congressmen, though they profess or believe in C. D., have no  
 
 faith in the constructive programme. I must proclaim from the housetop for the thousandth time that constructive programme is an integral part of the national movement and therefore also of C. D. C.
 D. without the backing of the constructive programme is criminal and a waste of effort. All cannot go to jail. But all must work the constructive programme. Even in armed conflict armies are power- fully helped by the civil population. Imagine the fate of the British forces, if their effort was not co-ordinated with that of the civilians. I was therefore delighted that there was a wide response from the prisoners and the other Congressmen this time in the matter of spinning  during  the   spinning   carnivallibtech_378_footnotelibtech_379_footnote.   I   dare   to   believe   that   if Congressmen were enthusiastic believers in communal unity and removal of untouchability and the like, there would be no communal discord and there would be no antagonism such as it is from Harijans. We are the makers of our own destiny. It has been somewhat justly said that if I am a good General, I must not grumble about my men. For I must choose them from the material at my disposal. I plead guilty. But I have qualified my admission by the adverb ‘somewhat’, for I laid down the conditions from the very inception of the programme of non-violence. My terms were accepted. If from experience it is found that the terms cannot be worked, I must either be dismissed or I must retire. I retiredlibtech_380_footnotebut to no purpose. The bond between Congressmen and me seems to be unbreakable. They may quarrel with my conditions but they will not leave me or let me go. They know that however unskilled a servant I may be, I will neither desert them nor fail them in the hour of need. And so they try, though often grumblingly, to fulfil my conditions. I must then on the one hand adhere to my conditions so long as I have a living faith in them and, on the other, take what I can get from Congressmen, expecting that if I am true, they will some day fulfil all my conditions and find themselves in the enjoyment of full independence such as has never before been seen on earth.
   There 		are two sides 		to the 		complaint about 		indiscipline. I 		must here confine 		myself to 		satyagrahi prisoners 		only. I 		would naturally like the other political prisoners to attend to what I say. It is  
 wrong to say that there is universal indiscipline among Congressmen or that all are unfit to be called satyagrahis. Cases of grave indiscipline have been brought to my notice. I know that violent men have crept into the organization under the guise of non-violence. But I know also cases of exemplary discipline. Everybody knows that there are in the movement and among the prisoners faithful Congressmen. I am conducting the struggle in their name and for their sake. It is through them that we may expect to win. This should mean no reflection on those who are weak but true. Even a child of seven who performs its allotted task faithfully will be entitled to the same credit as those who may cheerfully mount the gallows, if thereto called.
 What is happening now is a process of automatic selection.  Those who cannot stand the test will stay out without dishonour. Hypocrites and smugglers will be cast out because they will not stand the real heat or they will be rejected when found out.
   C 		class prisoners’ 		is almost 		a baffling 		question. I have 		said more 		than once that classification is 		bad in itself. But 		the Congress has 		come to 		no decision on 		the question. 		Meanwhile we must 		do the 		best we 		can. There 		is no manner 		of doubt 		in my mind 		that the treatment of 		C class prisoners 		is unhuman. 		I do 		not wish 		to blame either 		the Government 		or the 		prison officials. 		I admit 		that theirs is a 		thankless task. 		For ages almost 		they have been used to 		only one tradition. 		Their mind 		refuses to 		grasp the distinction 		between criminals and 		political prisoners. 		They would make no 		distinction between 		prisoners guilty of 		crimes and 		those who 		rebel against 		constituted authority. For 		them the 		political are 		worse than 		the others. But 		pressure of 		public opinion 		has compelled 		distinction. The result 		is highly 		unsatisfactory. The 		will on 		the part 		of the officials is 		lacking. Satyagrahis 		who seek imprisonment 		cannot with any dignity 		quarrel with the 		treatment they 		get, except 		when their 		honour is attacked. 		An irresponsible 		government, which the 		British Government in 		India is 		may, as 		it often does, 		defy public opinion. 		Satyagrahis have 		still to  court 		imprisonment. It 		is one of 		the gateways to 		liberty. They 		cannot stipulate 		as to the conditions 		of jail life.  
 But weak as public opinion is, it can express itself with effect on a matter of pure humanity. I have suggested that medical men should
 give the lead in this matter. I understand that a movement on their part is quite likely. It is cruel to distinguish between the food of the different classes. The needs in the majority of cases of the political prisoners are identical. I suggest that the rations of all political prisoners should approach what is known as balanced diet with the permission to replenish it at the prisoner’s expense. As to sanitation and other matters, a non-official medical committee should make recommendations which should be given effect to at once. There should be identity of treatment in all the provinces.
 Having said this, I must warn satyagrahis against hunger-strikes or the like. It is their duty to conform to the jail regulations in so far as they do not come in conflict with known rules of honour, not self- made ones by hyper-sensitive temperaments. These ought not to court imprisonment. I suggest that it is a satyagrahi’s first code of honour that he will conscientiously carry out jail  discipline  with  the reservation just mentioned. Satyagraha is a process of  silent conversion. Indiscipline and nagging are wholly inconsistent with the ambition of conversion. I am repeating these views of mine not without fear and trembling. For I know that jail officials have often quoted them on wrong occasions against satyagrahi prisoners. Of course in all I have said there is nothing against carrying out constitutional agitation for jail reforms even as to the so-called criminals. A satyagrahi is a universal reformer. For him there is no distinction between criminals and non-criminals. He is out to render service to the whole of humanity to the extent of his ability and opportunity.
 There is the question of newspapers and books. These are as important as food. Some would do without food but not without newspapers and literature. I hold that deprivation of this amenity is additional punishment for a political prisoner.
   Although 		I have 		dealt with 		the question of 		non-embarra- ssment 		in my previous 		statements, I see that 		it still 		continues to agitate 		many Congressmen. 		For one 		thing, it is part 		of the Bombay 		 Resolution and 		effect should be 		given to 		it. It 		is inherent 		in non- 		violence. But 		it is also 		expedient. By 		causing embarrassment 		at this 		stage, the 		authorities must resent 		it bitterly 		and are likely 		to act madly. 		Of course it would be different if we had resorted to armed rebellion.  
 Then the saying ‘their difficulty becomes our opportunity’ would apply. It is obvious that exactly the opposite rule should apply when an opposite method is adopted. It is worse than suicide to resort to violence, i.e., embarrassment under cover of non-violence. We may not be “temperate and furious” at the same time.
 ‘But then to be logical you must give up C. D. altogether’, says the critic. To give up C. D. would be folly. C. D. is itself completely non-violent action. It is a duty in the face of violence without parallel.
 C. D. in the present case means assertion of the right to speak against participation in this war or all war. If we cannot do even this much when the occasion demands it, we might as well give up non-violence.
  D. 	is the assertion 	of a right 	which law should 	give but it 	denies. If 	performance of 	a duty causes 	embarrassment, it cannot 	be helped. 	It is 	my duty 	to give 	up drink. 	It would 	cause some loss to the 	tavern- keeper. 	I am 	helpless. The 	authority can 	easily avoid 	embarrassment by 	recognizing the 	elementary right of 	non-violent free speech. Consideration 	whether the policy 	of self-imposed 	restraint creates an 	immediate impression on 	the authority 	is irrelevant. 	Belief that it must 	ultimately is 	inherent in 	belief is 	non-violence itself. We 	may not bear 	ill will against the 	bitterest opponent. 
   I 		do not 		share the 		belief that 		there is 		no life 		left in the Congress. 		“Still waters 		run deep.” 		Congressmen are 		too much 		attached to 		the Congress 		to let 		the institution die 		of inanity. 		There seems 		to be no life 		because we 		have no 		spectacular show 		in the 		shape of 		parliamentary programme or mass 		C. D. Things are 		going according to 		plan. C. 		D. is restricted to 		select individuals. 		It will 		be further 		restricted to 		those who 		reoffer C.D. as 		often as 		necessary. It 		does not 		matter if 		the number 		is reduced 		to ten 		or two. 		The two will 		represent the 		whole Congress. Does 		not one ambassador 		represent his people? 		One can be 		multiplied infinitely. 		Parliamentary activity has 		been almost 		stopped also according 		to plan. 		It may 		be, in my opinion 		should be, 		stopped completely. 		But I do 		not wish 		to rush things. Members 		of local boards 		have in many 		cases been 		 withdrawn according 		to plan.  
 Then what are the Congressmen to do if they cannot or will not be allowed to offer C. D. and there is no parliamentary programme? The answer is simple. There are only two things for Congressmen to
 
 do. All to carry on the thirteenfold constructive programme and some select few to offer C.D. in addition. C.D. is a mighty weapon to be wielded effectively by only a few in the first instance. Constructive programme is to be worked by all Congressmen and even non- Congressmen if they will. How can people shut their eyes to its paramount importance? Even parliamentary programme without it is a mere farce. We have had it till 1920. I do not deny its usefulness even as a farce is useful. But there is no such thing as a farce without the backing of a play. In 1920 the nation came into its own. Constructive programme was described in so many words to be a preparation for C.
  Parliamentary 	programme was given 	up in 	toto. 	The nation 	lost nothing 	by it. 	Parliamentary programme 	will have its 	definite place 	when we 	have a 	parliament of 	our own. Let 	it not be forgotten that 	this is 	expected to 	be a fight 	to the 	finish. It 	is true that C. 	D. will be 	suspended if 	genuine free 	speech is 	granted. If 	we do not 	find ourselves 	free at the end of the 	war, resumption will be 	a certainty. But 	that is idle 	speculation. If 	we do our present 	duty, whatever the 	circumstances that 	face us at the 	end of the 	war we shall 	be found 	ready. 
 Let me glance at the constructive programme. There is  communal unity. It is worth much more than the whole parliamentary programme. Without it, the latter is useless. It becomes a field for interminable wrangling. Complete heart-unity takes us almost straightway to independence. Let me not be told that there will be no unity at all or not in our lifetime. I must refuse to believe the negation so long as there are some Congressmen working for unity. If the Congress cannot, I know that no other institution can. For every Congressman whatever his faith must equally represent in his own person every Indian, no matter what his faith is. In that sense he belongs to all religions.
 Then take untouchability. I repeat that if untouchability lives, Hinduism and with it India dies. Is that not a programme worth living for, dying for? And the spinning-wheel whose every turn brings India nearer her destiny? Surely it can fully occupy every day of every Congressman. And the wheel being the centre of our solar system it includes all the planets in the shape of village industries.
The wheel brings us at once to the emancipation of India’s
 manhood, kisans, labourers and all those who are weary and heavy- laden. If this all-inclusive and mighty programme is not understood and appreciated by Congressmen they do not know the A B C of non- violence nor do they know the elements of C.D.
 This programme gives ample scope for public meetings, demonstrations, exhibitions and the like. No official Congress Committees need function for co-ordinating these activities. Wherever five earnest Congressmen are found, they can group together and organize them.
 Congress will now see why I contemplate no change in the programme as it is going and why I am full of hope for the future of the country.

It is cruel for the Government to say that they will not 	consider grievances unless the strike is given up. It is tantamount 	to saying that the sufferers should not suffer for the redress of 	wrongs done to them.  	I should have thought a responsive Government would all the more 	readily listen to appeals of the wronged when they are accompanied 	by self-inflicted suffering.

Courtesy : Pyarelal     WHAT JESUS MEANS TO MElibtech_392_footnote   	Although I have devoted a large part of my life to the study of 	religion and to discussion with religious leaders of all faiths, I 	know very well that I cannot but seem presumptuous in writing about 	Jesus Christ and trying to explain what He means to me. I do so only 	because my Christian friends have told me on more than a few 	occasions that for the very reason that I am not a Christian and 	that (I    
 shall quote their words exactly) “I do not accept Christ in the bottom of my heart as the only Son of God”, it is impossible for me to understand the profound significance of His teachings, or to know and interpret the greatest source of spiritual strength that man has ever known.
 Although this may or may not be true in my case, I have reasons to believe that it is an erroneous point of view. I believe that such an estimate is incompatible with the message that Jesus Christ gave to the world. For he was, certainly, the highest example of one who wished to give everything asking nothing in return, and not caring what creed might happen to be professed by the recipient. I am sure that if He were living here now among men, He would bless the lives of many who perhaps have never even heard His name, if only their lives embodied the virtues of which He was a living example on earth; the virtues of loving one’s neighbour as oneself and of doing good and charitable works among one’s fellow-men.
 What, then, does Jesus mean to me? To me He was one of the greatest teachers humanity has ever had. To His believers He was God’s only begotten Son. Could the fact that I do or do not accept this belief make Jesus have any more or less influence in my life? Is all the grandeur of His teaching and of His doctrine to be forbidden to me? I cannot believe so.
 To me it implies a spiritual birth. My interpretation, in other words, is that in Jesus’ own life is the key of His nearness to God; that He expressed, as no other could, the spirit and will of God. It is in this sense that I see Him and recognize Him as the Son of God.
 But I do believe that something of this spirit, that Jesus exemplified in the highest measure in its most profound human sense, does exist. I must believe this; if I do not believe it I should be a scep- tic; and to be a sceptic is to live a life that is empty and lacks moral content. Or, what is the same thing, to condemn the entire human race to a negative end.
 It is true that there certainly is reason for scepticism when one observes the bloody butchery that European aggressors have un- loosed, and when one thinks about the misery and suffering prevalent in every corner of the world, as well as the pestilence and famine that always follow, terribly and inevitably, upon war.
 In the face of this, how can one speak seriously of the divine spirit incarnate in man? Because these acts of terror and  murder  offend the conscience of man; because man knows that they represent evil; because in the inner depths of his heart and of his mind, he deplores them. And because, moreover, when he does not go astray,
 misled by false teachings or corrupted by false leaders, man has within his breast an impulse for good and a compassion that is the spark of divinity, and which some day, I believe, will burst forth into the full flower that is the hope of all mankind.
 An example of this flowering may be found in the figure and in the life of Jesus. I refuse to believe that there now exists or has ever existed a person that has not made use of His example to lessen his sins, even though he may have done so without realizing it. The lives of all have, in some greater or lesser degree, been changed by His presence, His actions, and the words spoken by His divine voice.
 I believe that it is impossible to estimate the merits of the various religions of the world, and moreover I believe that it is unnecessary and harmful even to attempt it. But each one of them, in my judg- ment, embodies a common motivating force : the desire to uplift  man’s life and give it purpose.
 And because the life of Jesus has the significance and the transcendency to which I have alluded, I believe that He belongs not solely to Christianity, but to the entire world; to all races and people, it matters little under what flag, name or doctrine they may work, profess a faith, or worship a god inherited from their ancestors.

     LETTER TO DUNCAN GREENLEES   November 1, 1941 I have 	your letter. It makes strange reading. I have no narrow patriotism 	about me. I would do anything to promote goodwill among men. 	Nothing can be done without men of the same opinion joining  	and co-operating. You may call them a party and condemn them. But 	they are not a party if they are against no one. Did Jesus and his 	twelve chosen disciples form a party or not?  	And is there any difference between Imperialism and Nazism? I see 	none. The latter is the logical outcome of the first. I cannot take 	up arms for Imperialism in the vain hope of destroying Nazism. I 	would rather be ground down between the two in resisting them 	unavoidably.

        CHI. 	SUSHILA,   LETTER TO SUSHILA NAYYAR   November 	2, 1941 
 I 	have your letter. I understand about Ba. Ba’s case is difficult.  	What you write about me is unnecessary. I am trying my very best to 	abide by everything you say. I am not allowing my sleep to be 	disturbed. I am also talking very little [during my walks]. I keep 	my eyes closed and observe silence in the evening as far as 	possible. With just three drops of sarpagandha the 	blood–pressure too has come down. I continue the efforts to 	further control it. I am sure if you were present here, you would 	have brought  it under control more effectively. So, pass your 	examination and come down. I like your self-confidence. But it must 	be backed by an equal measure  of reading.  	Suggest something for Sardar if you think it necessary. I give him a 	diet of soup of leafy vegetables and honey. He feels full of spirit.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original : Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy : Dr. Sushila Nayyar     LETTER TO DHARMAPRAKASH   November 	2, 1941  BHAI 	DHARMAPRAKASH,  	I have your letter. The depressed classes question is very 	complicated. It transcends politics. If enough money cannot be 	raised for our conference it should be postponed. How much can you 	get with my help? It will be more befitting if you make do with 	whatever you can collect on your own. You must also have a clear aim 	in view. 
 Remember that Dr. Ambedkar has placed a definite aim before himself. Study it. Digest it. And also understand fully what your own is.

        MY 	DEAR IDIOT,   LETTER TO AMRIT KAUR   November 	3, 1941 
  	It will be nice to make the help to Harijans dependent upon their 	conforming to your conditions. You should raise a whole-time worker 	there.  	Your dream was strange. Sometimes these do come. I attach no 	importance to them.  	When you come you will miss Raihana. She has become a member of the 	family and sings every evening. She has taught some a few verses 	from the Koran. She sings the shlokas libtech_400_footnotecorrectly.

  	There is nothing from you today. I forgot to write yesterday that my 	weight had increased by 1 1b. It was 103 1bs. The blood- pressure is 	fully under control. Ba does not heed the adivce that she should 	take rest. She is a difficult person. Balkrishna arrived yester- 	day. His room looks quite good with the extension of the verandah.

 November 5, 1941
 BROTHER PURSHOTTAM,
 I was dissatisfied with your speech in Biharlibtech_415_footnotelibtech_416_footnoteto the same extent as I was satisfied with your comments on the statement regarding Jayaprakash. It amounts to this that the teeth for show  and  for  chewing are different. And what a poisonous criticism of the Congress of which you are a member? If the Congress is as you believe it to be, what is the good of your continuing to be a member of the same? Your justification of the Congress policy at present appears to be a favour on it from a high position. I am writing this much as a friend of yours. This is not for discussion in the Press. No institution can
 
 advance by adverse criticism of any other institution. It progresses by its own strength.

SEVAGRAM,
    DEAR 	DR. JAYAKAR,  November 	6, 1941 
  	I was glad to hear from you. As you know I never told our friends 	that I would try to raise funds on any account. They never raised 	enough money themselves to enable me to make an appeal for funds. 	Now of course it is too late for me to do anything. But you are 	there to guide them.  	Now that I am writing to you, I feel tempted to tell you that I have 	read the appeals you have made to me from time to time with 	respectful attention. But I felt sorry that I could not make the 	response you expected, without denying the faith of a lifetime. I 	hope you are keeping fit.

  	I have your letter. In my estimate Sardar’s health is on the mend. 	You may ask Kishorelal why he thinks it is causing anxiety. I cannot 	ask him now as we are in the middle of a meeting.  	Ba, one may say, has recovered. That is why I have not written to 	you. She has been taking only medicines prescribed by you. She does 	not listen at all about taking rest. Once she got angry with me and 	said she was determined to keep on working. I laughed it away.  	Mahadev has received a communication from the Government about Bhai. 	It says that no permission can be given except on very special 	grounds. Only relatives can get such permission. I am afraid 	Pyarelal is going to refuse to meet anyone at all. Vinoba has 	stopped receiving visitors. Now the correspondence will be 	prolonged.  	For now it will be better for you to stay only at Puri’s. If you 	see any particular advantage in staying at the doctor’s, you may 	certainly go and stay there and say no to Puri. Think about it and 	write to me.  	I feel quite fit. I get a backache from fatigue. It is in the region 	of the shoulders. Prabhavati suggests it might be something else. 	That is why I am writing to you. Can there be any other reason for 	it except fatigue?  	About Chakrayya, Lakshmipati writes that he has quite recov- ered. 	He has no fever. He walks two miles.  	Annapurna’s weight can be said to be very good.Mahadev has gone to 	Gwalior. He will return on the 11th or earlier. He may visit you 	there for a day.

 discussion will take us into deeper waters. No time for it.

  	The pain in the shoulder does not seem to be wholly due to fatigue. 	Massage does give some relief. But it may well be rheuma-    
 tism. I am observing.
 The blood-pressure is quite satisfactory. It is 150/88. I am able to eat a lot. Still, it may be necessary to remain on a diet of fruit for a couple of days.
 Sometimes I do feel it would be good if you were by my side. But I quicky drive the thought from my mind. I consider it is a thought best avoided till after your examination.

  From 	the Gujarati original : Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy : Dr. Sushila Nayyar     STATEMENT ON INDO-CEYLONESE PACT   WARDHA,  November 11, 1941 The 	proposed  Indo-Ceylonese  Pactlibtech_447_footnotelibtech_448_footnoteis 	 not  open  to  the  fatal objections that have been universally 	raised against the Indo-Burman  	thing,libtech_449_footnotewhich 	was sprung upon an unsuspecting public as an almost settled fact. 	What has come from Ceylon is a proposal for examination by the 	Government and the public. I have studied the relevant papers as 	much as possible.  	On merits, the Ceylon proposal is open to objection in the same 	manner as the Burman. I suggest to Ceylon Ministers that there is no 	reason whatsoever for hurry. Adjustment can easily be made about the 	supply of labour, but wholesale legislation may be left over till 	after the war. The war is a terrible tragedy, the like of which is 	unknown to history. But the tragedy will be deeper still, if at the 	end we find      Press”, 	24-8-1941. 
 ourselves living the old way without radical changes in every walk of life.
 Let me recall here the goodwill mission that was sent by the Congress in July 1939 in the person of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. It had created a deep impression upon the Singhalese and their Minis- ters. It was hoped that the good seed sown by our ambassador would fructify. When the Ceylon deputation came to India in November last, it was arranged that they would meet him in Allahabad. But he was arrested before they could meet. Jawaharlal had prepared a note for them. It will be published, if I find it necessary to do so.
 My object in recalling the mission and the attempt made thereafter is to point out the way to lasting peace and brotherliness between Ceylon and India. It is unthinkable that Burma, Ceylon and India should distrust one another or regard the presence of their nationals among their neighbours as antagonistic to one another.
 Any harmful migration from one country to the other may surely be regulated by voluntary adjustment without much legal inter- ference. I feel somehow that no harm has accrued to Ceylon by the settlement of Indians there. As elsewhere, Indian merchants and pro- fessionals had followed in the wake of labour imported wholly for the benefit of Ceylon.
 Sir Edward Jackson’s report, I understand, clearly shows that Indian emigration to Ceylon has done no harm to the indigenous population.
 But, if my plea for patient waiting falls on deaf ears, I suggest much the same thing that I have suggested for Burma. I should have no difficulty in persuading experienced legislators that in legislation affecting men in the street and addressed to the masses the simplest and shortest method is best. I, therefore, suggest that the whole of the Indian population found in Ceylon on a given date (kept  secret) should be registered and clothed with full rights of citizenship. Those who may be outside Ceylon but who can unquestionably be proved to be bona fide residents of Ceylon should also be registered on application. This procedure obviates the intricacies which permeate the proposal under examination.
 The term ‘domicile’ should find no place in such legislation. The English law of domicile is the worst possible. Judges have been known to have been confused over the interpretation of the term. Human liberty is a precious thing, which must not be trifled with by legal subtleties and interminable wranglings in courts of law. The wrangling attains no dignity, because it takes place in a law-court. Men should know definitely where they stand in given circumstances.
 So far as labour is concerned, I have no doubt that Ceylon should have the sole right to import as much as it likes under contracts easily to be understood and mutually agreed to between the two Governments.
 The suggested quota system should have no place in an honourable understanding.

   STATEMENT TO THE PRESS     WARDHAGANJ, 
  November 	12, 1941  	I observe that there is a move to press the Government to release 	satyagrahi prisoners.  	It is, perhaps, appropriate to mention that so far as I know there 	will be on the part of the Congress neither appreciation of nor 	response to any such gesture by the Government.  	Those who may be discharged will have to be invited to re-offer 	civil disobedience if they are physically fit. Moreover, there will 	be great resentment if distinction is made between satyagrahis and 	those who are detained without trial. The Government should not be 	judges of what is reasonable. What 	the public demand is this :  	Let the Government keep the prisoners, but give decent treatment to 	the prisoners whether they hunger-strike or not. They need not take 	notice of such strikes when there is no reasonable cause for that.  	The Deoli prisoners’ demands as far as they are known are just. 	Let them end the terrible suspense by granting the demands  and 	ending the hunger-strike.  	Let them also examine the recently published weighty manifesto by 	representative and prominent medical men from all India on the    
 dietary of C class prisoners and make the necessary changes and redress such other disabilities which have no just basis.
 I, therefore, suggest to those who are urging the Government to discharge satyagrahi prisoners that they will do well if they will concentrate on the relief herein suggested.libtech_453_footnoteIt can be granted quickly without any political or other embarrassment.

   STATEMENT TO THE PRESS     WARDHAGANJ, 
  November 	14, 1941  	I sent the following telegramlibtech_458_footnoteto Shri Jayaprakash Narayan on the 12th instant. To 	this, I have just received the following reply :  Thanks 	for the telegram. 	Have explained the whole 	position to Sardar 	Mangal Singh. 	Our demands 	are reasonable. 	Please excuse inability to 	discontinue the 	hunger-strike. May do what you can outside. Do not send Prabhavati.  	I have heard nothing as yet from Sardar Mangal Singh. shall, no 	doubt, do so in due course. But the matter is too urgent to brook 	delay. I have heard that Shri Jayaprakash has lost heavily in 	weight. Forcible feeding can only be a temporary makeshift. Shri 	Jayaprakash is one of the most determined of workers. I flatter 	myself with the belief that if anything could have melted him our 	joint  telegram should have. His preventing his wife from going to 	him is ominous. He wants no interference, emotional or other, with 	his decision.  
 So far as I can see, there is no political motive behind this hunger-strike. The refusal to consider the case until the hunger-strike is given up is a cruel joke. It would be an act of inhumanity if Shri Jayaprakash and his fellow-detenus are detained till their lives are in danger. I appeal to the Government, in the name or humanity,  forthwith to grant the request of the detenus. The plea of ascertaining and carrying out the wishes of the Provincial Governments is irrele- vant and untenable. The Central Government is in no way bound to oblige the Provincial Governments in matters where the  life  and liberty of the citizen is involved. There must be something radically wrong if the Provincial Governments are afraid to keep their own detenus within their borders.
 This continuing hunger-strike shows the futility of discharging civil resistance prisoners who have themselves sought imprisonment. With what face can they come out when those who have not sought imprisonment are  detained  without  trial  and  are   hunger-striking for the minimum of conveniences to which every human being is entitled?

I have letters of you both.
 I understand about you. Khersaheb and I were so busy, each with his own affairs, that we could meet only for a few minutes. I therefore forgot to talk to him about you. I will now write to him and inquire.
 The plan for the building was sent by Chimanlalbhai at the Mani Bhuvan address. If you have received it, let him know your decision about it.
 About Ratubhai I believe that you should go and fetch him and keep him with you. Let him have the taste of brotherly love. When you come here, you will of course bring him along with you. If Champa arrives in December we shall see what can be done. I agree with Manju’s analysis.
 I am glad that Munno often mentions Sevagram. Only if the other children too feel the same way, will they enjoy staying here. If
 they cannot forget their attachment to city life, they will never be happy in Sevagram.

I was a little surprised that you 	permitted him to take ten rupees. That is the way of the rich. The 	children must know and learn that we are poor. Both of them sit with 	me at the meals. The Sardar and Kanam have warmly taken to each 	other. Do not worry in the least.

  From 	the Gujarati original : Mrs. Sumitra Kulkarni Papers. Courtesy : 	Nehru Memorial Museum and Library     HOW TO PAY THE EIGHT-ANNA WAGE?   	The satyagrahis as well as the others who have courted arrest are 	spinning a lot during the present movement. I am receiving news from 	all the prisons that spinning is going on with great enthusiasm and 	interest. For me this is heartening news. It may be said that Shri 	Dhirendra Majumdar is a paragon among the prisoners. He spins 	himself, makes others spin and has been deeply pondering over the 	methods of improving the charkha. I have received a letter from him 
 which deserves serious consideration. I am, therefore, reproducing it below for the benefit of khadi-lovers.libtech_474_footnote
 This scheme seeks to realine the dream of paying the spinners and ultimately all labourers, i.e., craftsmen, eight annas for an eight- hour day. It does not attempt to give everyone everything here and now. But the attempt is to show that all this can be achieved within ten years.
 Bhai Dhirendra does not express a definite opinion on the scheme but seeks the opinion and comments of other experts. Maybe he does not have in the prison all the necessary literature on the subject. About the scheme at the moment I can only say that all khadi workers should examine it and experiment in this direction. Small experiments need almost no capital. For exapmle, training ten  or twenty spinners and a few teachers and keeping a record of the results should not involve much expenditure.
 The chief merit of the scheme lies in its being almost self- supporting. It consists of two parts. It does lay a little burden on the institution in the form of enhanced wages. But the other half deals with payment to the spinners after training them for higher produc- tion. Another merit of the scheme is the attempt at all-round reform in the spinners’ lives. I attach importance to the scheme from this point of view. This scheme is not the handiwork of an ignorant khadi-lover but has been thought out by a responsible and practical worker. Dhirendra Babu is not merely the author of this scheme. He is himself going to implement it.
 Every experimenter in the field should remember that the  scheme takes into consideration all the processes from cotton growing to weaving.

  	There is so much pressure of work at present that I find writing to 	you a severe test. Sardar can be said to be quite well. He still 	does not accept this. I felt relief in my constipation because I 	gave up milk and butter for two days. I felt good and the 	blood-pressure came down to 136/88 in the afternoon. I have taken 	milk today. I have also taken butter. I am all right. The 	blood-pressure is 156/96.  	Ba is coughing a little at night. She is eating well. She is strain- 	ing herself a lot.  	The crowd here defies description.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original : Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy : Dr. Sushila Nayyar     LETTER TO AMARNATH JHA   SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,  November 	20, 1941  BHAI 	AMARNATHJI, I 	venture to write to you without earlier acquaintance.  	Your election as President of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan made me 	glad as well as sad. Who would not be glad at the election of a 	scholar like you? But I must confess that I was sad, too; because I 	had, in the interest of work, wanted Rajendra Babu to be the 	President this year. That is why Seth Jamnalal Bajaj proposed the 	name of Rajendra Babu.  	You are of course aware that I have been closely associated with the 	Sammelan for many years. I had a hand in framing the policy of the 	Sammelan towards propagation of Hindi. It has developed some 
 political overones too. I shall not be able to attend the Sammelan. Hence myself and a few friends thought that the election of Rajendra Babu would safeguard the interests of the Sammelan.
 But this did not happen. Now all my hopes rest on you. I hope to secure your help in what I had expected from Rajendra Babu.
 It will be common ground between you and me that all of us should endeavour to do our best, keeping in view the accommodating attitude of Tandonjilibtech_486_footnotewho is the soul of the Sammelan, and all the other things we know he stands for.
 I do not know whether or no you approve of the policy adopted at Indorelibtech_487_footnoteand Nagpurlibtech_488_footnote. Some attempts were made at Poona to change that policy. The attempts did succeed to some extent. I do not how- ever regard these changes as intolerable. But further steps in that direction will become unbearable for persons like me. My efforts would be to move a step further than at Nagpur. I am convinced this would secure the progress of Hindi and the welfare of the nation. Hindi-Urdu controversy should not have been started nor should it be continued.
 There have been sharp differences about the Wardha  office. That office must be subordinate to the Sammelan but I think it should have as much autonomy as the Madras office. If it is agreed that the Wardha office has well served the cause of Hindi, it should, I think, enjoy greater autonomy than it has today.
 Rajendra Babu’s presence at the Sammelan is uncertain. He cannot stand the December weather of the Punjab. Nor can Seth Jamnalalji go. Kakasaheb Kalelkar and Acharya Shriman Narayan may go. Please lend your ear to them. I wish there should be no conflicts at the Sammelan nor any meaningless controversy. If there are differences on principles, let them be expressed in a friendly spirit. Therefore I would request you, if you can spare the time, to come here for a day so that all of us can meet and talk things over. Rajendra Babu and Jamnalalji are here for the time being. If you cannot come for want of time or for other reasons, I can send Kakasaheb and
 
 Shrimanji to you. Please let me know your convenience.
Kindly excuse me for the trouble.

You 	pleaded inability to get on with the Bengal workers. You wanted to 	come to Sevagram. I took pity and let you come. Inch by inch I came 	to know of your difficulties and I began to accommodate you. When I 	thought you to be unworthy of support, I declined to con- tinue, 	after notice. Was that a wrong done to you? You yourself admit that 	you acted hastily and thoughtlessly. I acted in the only honou- 	rable way I could. I was disbursing public funds. You should know 
 that I brought you here almost against the wish of trusted co-workers. Your wants were and are beyond your market value. I doubt whether I should have given you the support I did. I still continue to do what I can for you because I believe you to be a person willing to serve but with reasoning faculty gone astray. Your present letter is proof of what I say.
 I suggest your showing all the correspondence between us to your friends or rather the other workers. Let Dhirenda say what he thinks of it. It is a serious thing for you to harbour the wrong against me and be satisfied that all is well.
 Of course if you harbour any wrong against me, your wife cannot help it. And it is but natural that she cannot send Abha to such a man as me. I hope this letter will clear all your doubts. If it does not, you should pursue the inquiry till you convince me of my error or are yourself convinced of doing wrong to me in thinking as you do.
 You are wrong about Sailen. He is not going to help Rishabhdas but the latter is willing for my sake to take him up. Had you not been in need of money, I might not have sent Sailen. S[ailen] too likes the job.

You may well pass in the examination, but 	your studies being disturbed without cause can only result in harm.

You cannot also change the decision to get away for three months. It 	does have its advantages. Why worry about the loss of pay? Surely 	you are not going to stick to the salary. No, you must not change 	the three-month decision. I 	had a dream only yesterday that you are sure to get your   D.; 		that you 		are extremely talented 		and have 		been offered a salary 		of three or 		four hundred rupees for 		a couple 		of years 		merely to ena- 		ble you to 		enhance your 		knowledge; I 		had to 		take a 		decision and 		I could 		not arrive 		at any 		and then I 		woke up 		to find that there 		was neither any offer nor did I have to take any decision.

  From 	the Gujarati original : Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy : Dr. Sushila Nayyar     STATEMENT TO THE PRESS   WARDHAGANJ,  November 27, 1941 The 	discontinuance of the hunger-strike by the Deoli detenus relieves 	the terrible tension under which the public was labouring. It  	was not possible to contemplate with unconcern the starvation, even 	self-inflicted, of patriots, whether one agreed with their method or 	not. 
 Let us hope that repatriation will be hastened and their treatment will not be worsened for their removal to their respective provinces.
 I have read the Government communique describing the bewitching life in Deoli. I recall a similar description of life in the Andamans. It read like a fairy tale and yet most of the inmates preferred to return home. These descriptions, however truthful they may be in the estimation of the writers not themsleves detenus, do not answer the reality as the detenus see it. The object of the communique, on the face of it, is to show that the condition in Deoli was superior to what it was in the respective provinces. If such was the case, it shows how correct and proper was the demand of the hunger-strikers that their condition on repatriation should be no worse than in Deoli. I should translate the demand thus :
  Repatriation 	should not 	be to a 	remote godforsaken 	place in 	the detenu’s 	province. The object 	of repatriation 	would be 	wholly frustrated 	if the 	detenus are 	transferred to 	a place 	far away from their 	homes.  The 	conveniences and 	food should 	be as near 	to Deoli’s 	latest standard as possible. 
 That is so far as the prisoners’ demands are concerned. But something more is needed. Seeing that the detenus have not been tried, the burden is on the Government to give them as decent a treatment as possible. War economy has no place in this connection, for detention is itself a war measure and could not be justified on any other ground. Therefore, they are entitled to family allowance and travelling expenses for their families when necessary. It should be remembered that most of the detenus are poor people. So much as to Deoli.
 But I feel that the question of food, sanitation and classification is and should be treated as an all-India question. I confine myself just now only to political prisoners, whether detenus detained on suspicion or satyagrahis who have courted imprisonment. If I had the authority, I would treat all prisoners alike, making a distinction only on the ground of health and habit. But I must not complicate the main issue by raising others [that] do not demand immediate solution. I think that classifications should be scrapped. At best they are arbitrary.
 The scale prescribed in the very weighty and reasoned manifesto recently issued by eminent medical men representing the whole of India should be accepted forthwith as the minimum scale for all India, with such variations as staples grown in various provinces  may demand. All political prisoners should have the right to supplement their food and other requirements from their own pockets.
 All should be supplied with a selection of newspapers and magazines of known standing without any censoring. There should be no restrictions as to choice of books. What is not generally prohibited in India should be allowed to prisoners. They should be allowed to write letters and receive visitors on the same scale as in B class.
 It should be common cause that no recognition should be given to hunger-strikes for wringing illegitimate concessions nor need they be penalized by refusal to consider legitimate demands on merits. For a prisoner under stress, hunger-strike is the last non-violent remedy. He seeks to end imposed suffering by self-imposed suffering. He thereby hopes to melt the heart of authority or at least enlist the sympathy of the public. Experience shows that the method is not to be despised. It has succeeded in several cases. But it is not easy to know always whether the cause for which a strike is undertaken is valid. We know, too, that Governments do not always come to a right decision in such cases. I have before me the case of a prisoner, who has given up his strike at my instance. The cause, as transpires in the record of the case before me, seems to have been more than valid. The vegetables served contained a dead scorpion. The men who had resorted to hunger-strike are now being tried for breach of jail regulations in that they refused the food served. There is the Chunar hunger-strike now going on for a fortnight. It is in respect of the treatment of C class prisoners. I have wired pleading for its suspension.libtech_499_footnote
 I think that hunger-strikes should not be regarded as a crime, but whenever such a strike takes place it should be referred to a judicial tribunal with the right to the prisoner to be represented by a lawyer of his choice. If the cause is found to be valid, the grievance should be removed. If the hunger-strike is persisted in, although the finding is against the prisoner, the fast should be ignored. If the procedure recommended by me is adopted the probability is that strikes will automatically decrease. Where the cause is valid, the authorities will grant redress on a mere notice of hunger-strike and where the strike is found to be unjustified there will be no public sympathy. It follows that there would be no forcible feeding if the procedure I am recommending is adopted. In rare and obstinate cases a life may have to be lost. It is impossible always to prevent suicide, even by fasting.
 Fasting has come to stay as a remedy for redress of grievances. It has its uses. An honest fast draws attention to a felt grievance and
 
 compels redress. What I have suggested is regularization of the huma- nitarian instinct and the rescuing of a useful institution from ridicule or contempt.

KRISHNACHANDRA,  	It is not necessary to give jaggery to everyone. Some of the guests 	sitting by my side sometimes take jaggery and sometimes do not. Two 	children invariably take it. It could be offered to other children 	also. It is not common practice to offer jaggery. Outsiders have 	complained that a lot of sweets are served here and the criticism is 	correct. This may lead to some dissatisfaction; but you should face 	it and give your explanation. Starch and jaggery have the same food 	value; but the processes of their digestion are different. Starch 	has yet to be converted into jaggery. 
 Twig brushes can be cut only from babul or neem trees. It is undoubtedly theft to cut them from trees not belonging to us. We must get them from trees earmarked for us. Tell this to B[alvantsinha] and select a tree or two. Thorns may be used as fuel or put to some [other] use.
 Govindrao does not have the strength. He is not idle, he is weak. If a man dare not touch a scorpion, even though each of us can lift it with our hands, how can he be compelled to do so? Govindrao is afraid of contracting leprosy. This fear is not peculiar to him; many people have it. This work, it is quite obvious, can be allotted only to a willing worker.
 Cleaning of latrines should be completed before meals. If that is not possible, let it be done at 2 in the afternoon. This should be deci- ded by common consent and from the point of view of hygiene.
 Efforts are made to give advance intimation about guests. Lanterns may be bought if necessary. I do try to reduce to the minimum the number of people staying here.
 The contact with cities is inevitable. We have to watch whether we earn in the cities or merely help in enabling the cities to exploit the villages. Yes, we should try to reduce to the minimum contact with cities.
 We have to create love for physical labour. The difficulty is that guests outnumber regular inmates in the Ashram. How can the guests be expected to labour? Make a list of the regular inmates and you will be surprised to see how few we are.

 When will you be able to attend to your studies properly? Right now, Raihana is here. I think of you. She can teach music very well. She can teach other things also. But all such things only after your examination is over. When will you be going to Lahore? Sardar, who was having a harrowing time with six or seven doctors, is now almost free from trouble since he came. The spasms have not ceased completely, but he is not suffering in any way. He used to pass five motions a day; now it is only once, and that too, with the help of enema. He used to sepnd an hour on the toilet seat, but now he spends fifteen minutes at the most. Only my treatment is being given—mud- packs, hip-bath and lying in warm water. He is allowed to take as much honey and lime as he can. He is feeling quite energetic.

It is certainly sad about Sitalibtech_515_footnotelibtech_516_footnote,  but  you  need not get frightened. Such a thing 	could have happened  here,  too, though of course there would be 	less danger here.  	It is clear that you cannot leave. I think it is the duty of you 	both to spend your lives there. You may bring up Sita there as best 	as you can. If I brought her up, I would do so under my close 	personal supervision, as I did the four [brothers] and other 	[children]. I do not repent having done that. According to me, they 	have lost nothing. If Harilal went to school, etc., you see the 	result. We cannot see the weaknesses of barristers and 	degree-holders, for we are overawed by them. In fact, there are many 	even among barristers and doctors who, like Harilal, lead immoral 	lives and are given to drinking. But they are big men, holding 	degrees, and so their weaknesses are not noticed. And, moreover, I 	myself condemned Harilal, and that also is one reason why he is on 	the streets. It was my duty to denounce him, though I think 	“denounce” is not the right word in this context. If, however, 	you are not convinced of the correctness of my advice, and if you 	can overcome your desire to keep Sita with you and she herself is 	willing, you may send her over and she will be educated in the    
 manner you desire. Devdas and Ramdas bring up their children as they think best. You both have the same right. I can only advise you as a friend. The right belongs to the parents alone, and it is their moral duty, too, to bring up their children in the way they think best.
 Do ask Virji’s son, too. You need not feel awkward about it. You did well, of course, to explain to Sita a woman’s function. Instruction in regard to sex organs will do her nothing but good. If the instruction is pure, the children will understand the right function of the organs and will learn self-control. Everything will depend on how the instruction is imparted. You yourself should think over this matter. Naraharibhai has written something Kishorelalbhai also will write to you and send you some useful literature. Please do not get frightened.

 December 4, 1941
 BHAI SAMPURNANAND,
 I just got your letter. Even before your letter arrived I had, in the course of a letter to a friend, stated that you were fully entitled to offer criticism. It has had no adverse effect on me, although I main- tain that there is absolutely no ground whatsoever for your criticism. At the back of [the struggle for] freedom of speech there is [the claim for] independence as it was at the back of the Salt [Satyagraha]. But then this is a controversial subject. Time will reveal everything.
 That leaves the question of Hindi. This controversy is meaning- less and stems from ignorance. No one in the Congress is antagonistic towards Hindi. And no one will suspect me of such antagonism. But I may differ in my policy [regarding Hindi]. And if this happens to be the case, what would be my position in the Sammelanlibtech_532_footnote? I  have  been dragged into the Sammelan and I can quit this moment. I regard Urdu and the Persian script as included in Hindi. I have been maintaining this view since the Indore [session]. The man responsible for giving to the national language the name Hindustani [and getting it] accepted by the Congress is Tandonji. Now what can be done? I think the resolution was all right. And if it was so we should regard Hindustani as a synonym for Hindi. Now tell me if there is anything wrong in it. Rajendra Babu is not in a condition to go to Kashi. And he is certainly not going to Abohar. Kakasaheb and Shrimanji are on their way to meet Dr. Amarnathji.libtech_533_footnoteMaybe, now Tandonji himself will come out. Whatever he says will be done.

  INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS 
 WARDHAGANJ,
 December 4, 1941
 In the course of an interview, this afternoon, on the Government of India’s communiquelibtech_534_footnoteregarding the release of political prisoners, Mahatma Gandhi said :
 As I have said before the event,libtech_535_footnoteI must repeat after the event, that, so far as I am concerned, it cannot evoke a single responsive or appreciative chord in me.
 From my student days onward, I have been, and still claim to be, a friend of the British people. But my friendship cannot blind me to the fact that British representatives hold India as a bondslave. All the freedom that India enjoys is the freedom of a slave and not the freedom of an equal, which is otherwise known as Complete Indepen- dence. Mr. Amery’s pronouncements do not soothe the festering sore, but are like sprinkling chillies on it. It is in that setting that I am called upon to examine this release.
 If the Government of India are confident of the determination of all responsible opinion in India to support the war effort, the logi- cal conclusion would be to keep the civil disobedience prisoners in their custody, because they produce a jarring note. The only meaning  I can attach to the release, therefore, is that they expect that the  prisoners will have changed their opinions in  their  self-invited solitude. I am hoping that the Government will be soon disillusioned.
 Civil disobedience was not taken up without the most careful consideration. It was certainly not taken up out of any vindictiveness. It was taken up, and I hope will be continued, in order to make good the claim of the Congress to let the British people and the world know that there is, at the very least, a large body of public opinion represented by the Congress which is utterly opposed to participation in the war, not because it wishes any disaster to the British arms or
 
 victory to the Nazi or Fascist arms, but because it sees no deliverance from blood-guiltiness either for the victor or for the vanquished, and certainly no deliverance for India out of this war.
 The Congress, which seeks and claims to represent the dumb millions, has, for the past twenty years, accepted non-violence as its unbroken policy to achieve India’s independence. To stop civil disobedience, symbolic though it may be for the time being, will be to deny its policy at a crucial moment. The Government claim that, in spite of the Congress efforts, they are able to get all the men and money from India. Therefore the Congress opposition, in their estimate, can only be a moral effort and a moral demonstration. I, for one, am entirely satisfied with it, because I am convinced that from that moral demonstration will arise, when the moment comes, a demonstration which will result in the attainment of India’s independence, not the ascendance of this party or that. The Congress struggle covers every single unit in India.
 Now that the Congress Presidentlibtech_536_footnotelibtech_537_footnoteis expected to be out, it will be for him to consider whether and when to call the Congress Working Committee or the A. I. C. C. These two bodies will determine the future policy of the Congress. I am but a humble  instrument  of service in conducting the civil disobedience.
 I would, however, say one word about the detenus and other prisoners. It sounds strange that those who have sought imprisonment are to be discharged and not those who are either detained without trial or imprisoned because they hold the freedom of their country dearer than their personal liberty. There is surely something utterly wrong somewhere. Therefore I cannot rejoice over the Government of India’s decision.

  LETTER TO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU 
 December 5, 1941
 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 It is nice to be able to write to you outside the jail. But the pleasure is only momentary for I cannot reconcile myself to these discharges. However, we meet this new menace.
 This is merely to tell you that I delayed answering your question as the rumour about your discharge was in the air.
 
 I have read your letters most carefully. I agree with your conclusions and I like the very generous manner in which you have treated the whole thing. I had one and only one chat with Flibtech_538_footnotelibtech_539_footnote. and he accepted my proposition that he would not think of marrying Indu without your consent and blessing. Indu wrote to J. that she  was coming and seeing me too. Now that you are out and probably will be for a few days if not longer, you will shape this thing as you wish.
 I hope you have liked the recent statements issued by me. You will tell me when you are coming. Maulanalibtech_540_footnotelibtech_541_footnotetelephoned today saying he proposed to come after two or three days. I propose to leave here on 9th for Bardoli for one month. Sardar wants me to give one month to Gujarat. He is under treatment, mostly dietetic. I have prescribed the diet. I think his pain is most bearable under that regime. So far as it is possible our talks and meetings should take place in Bardoli. The discharges are a challenge. I feel that we should hold the W[orking] C[ommittee], A. I. C. C. meetings as early as we can. But of this you and Maulana are the best judges.
 I am writing this against time. Love.

 CHI. PREMA,
I have your letter.
 Now that you have been released, your responsibility and mine have increased. There is no question of your returning [to jail] immediately. I am thinking [about it].
 I am leaving for Bardoli on the 9th. Go to Rajkot meanwhile and come to Bardoli after finishing your work there. I will not be in a hurry to send you away from there.
 I am fully satisfied with Lakshmibai. She is a very good and thoughtful lady.
 
 I hope you keep fine health. I have no time to write more. All those released from Nagpur have come to see me. I am writing this surrounded by a large crowd.

I am unshaken in my faith that your present diet is sufficient and that you must improve with it. Nevertheless, we must respect the doctor’s findings. Do not be negligent about taking rest. You must take walks both morning and evening. Listen to the doctor’s advice and walk as much as possible or lie down but do not sit for too long. We had already decided about a belt when you were here. But if there is any speciality in the Powell belts, let one be procured there.

   STATEMENT TO THE PRESS     WARDHAGANJ, 
  December 7, 1941 The jail 	delivery that is going on apace of satyagrahis must be  taken as a 	challenge to convene a meeting of the A. I. C. C. which, the  	Government of India have been evidently induced to expect, will 	reverse the Bombay decision, whose working is reflected in  my 	conduct of the satyagraha campaign. I have, therefore, advised the 	Maulana Saheb to convene a meeting of the Working Committee and the 	A.I.C.C. at an early date, but until that decision is reversed civil 	disobedience has to go on.  	I must admit, however, that the conduct of the campaign has been 	rendered difficult by the Government action in discharging civil 	disobedience prisoners, but if we are to reach our goal, we have to 	cut our way through every difficulty. This one is nothing compared 	to what we are likely to have to face before we come into our own.  	If the A. I. C. C. meeting is to come, as it must, pending the 	meeting members of the Working Committee and the A. I. C. C. must 
 not offer civil disobedience, nor should those who are interested in reversing the Bombay decision.
 Apart from these, civil disobedience should continue without interruption. Of course it will stand suspended on Xmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day.
 The question naturally arises whether civil disobedience is to be offered in the usual manner by reciting the prescribed formulalibtech_544_footnoteor in some other manner.
 I like the formula method. It gives directness and symmetry to the movement. There is great power in the reciting of  the  same formula in the same manner. It rivets the attention of the masses and men on identical theme. The formula is not a mean thing. It is a protest of the nation against war as an arbitrator. It is a message of peace on earth and goodwill towards mankind. What is individual formula today will become, in due time, that of the masses, but the authorities having discharged symbolical satyagrahis may refuse to rearrest them for reciting slogans.
 There are then two ways open to us: If they do not rearrest, there need be no dismay and demoralization, the jail is not our objective. Freedom of speech is the immediate objective. If recitation is not objected to, we have advanced somewhat towards our objective and it will be foolish to court imprisonment for the sake of it.
 Dismay and demoralization arise because Congressmen in general have not realized the inevitable connection between construc- tive programme and civil disobedience. Civil disobedience without the backing of constructive programme can never lead us to indepen- dence. Shorn of it, civil disobedience becomes method of violence bound to prove ineffective in the end.
 Moreover, civil disobedience, even when it is mass, will only be offered by those who are bodily fit, whereas constructive programme is for all and will never be suspended. If the whole nation took it up in earnest it is enough to give us complete independence. The prosecu- tion of the constructive programme means constructing the structure of swaraj.
 The whole theme of corporate non-violence, as I have conceived it, falls to pieces if there is no living faith in the constructive programme.
To my mind, swaraj based on non-violence is a fulfilment of the
 
 
 constructive programme; hence, whether the authorities jail us or not, we must pursue the constructive programme.
 I have been asked whether discharged satyagrahis should hold or attend meetings and deliver speeches. They should do so. I do not want or expect them to re-offer civil disobedience immediately. That would be indecent haste, but ordinary civil disobedience may go on. For the discharged ones let there be breathing time. Let them address meetings in their constituencies and study things. At the meetings they will expound their views on the general situation and not hesitate to interpret anti-war Congress policy.
 Symbolic satyagraha has a definite meaning but it is open to the authorities to arrest Congressmen for their speeches even if they do not intend thereby to offer C. D. That was how they had arrested the Maulana Sahib and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, not to mention lesser lights.
 Let it be known that I have no authority to suspend C. D. on extraneous grounds. That is for the Congress to do. For me personally there is no choice.
 As a man sworn to peace, at this critical moment to suspend my anti-war activity would be to deny myself.
 Therefore, for those who think like me, whether we are misunderstood or worse befalls, we must express our faith through our action hoping thereby that ultimately our way will be accepted by all warring powers as the only escape from a blood-bath which  is  reducing man to his lowest depth.

  ASHRAM NOTE 
 December 8, 1941
 The rules deducible from the eleven observanceslibtech_546_footnoteand essential for a well-regulated Ashram life are as follows :
 All members—whether permanent or otherwise—will turn every minute of their time to good account. They will take part in every corporate activity of the Ashram. When free from Ashram work they will spin or carry out some other process connected with cotton. They will prosecute their private studies from 8 to 9 p.m. or during daytime, when they have no Ashram work to do and have done at least one hour’s spinning.
 They may not spin when they are ill or otherwise unable to spin owing to circumstances beyond their control.
 
 
 No one should talk idly or in a loud voice. The Ashram must bear the impress of perfect peace as well as of truth. Our relations with one another must be marked by affection and restraint, and  with guests and visitors by courtesy. Whether a visitor is dressed in rags or in gorgeous robes, we should treat him with the same respect. We must not make any distinction between the rich and the poor, the high and the lowly. This does not mean that we may expect a  delicately nurtured guest to live as simply as ourselves. That is to say, in waiting upon guests, we must always take into consideration their habitual mode of life. This is true courtesy. If an unknown visitor arrives at the Ashram, we must ask him the purpose of his visit, and if necessary take him to the manager. This is the duty of every inmate of the Ashram, because we cannot know whom such a visitor is likely to meet first.
 Our every word and every act should be well considered. What- ever we do we should do with a will and in complete identification with the work of the moment.
 Food must be taken like medicine, under proper restraint, only for sustaining the body and keeping it a fit instrument for service. We must therefore take food in moderation or even abstemiously. We must be content with what food we get. If the food is insufficiently or badly cooked, we must not talk about it at meals, but courteously speak about it later to the manager of the kitchen. Bad or imperfectly cooked food should not be eaten. We must not champ while eating. We must eat our food slowly, decorously and tidily in a spirit of thankfulness to God.
 Everyone must wash his own dish thoroughly and keep it in its place.
 Guests and visitors are requested to bring their own plate, drink- ing pot, bowls and spoon, as well as lantern, bedding and mos-quito- net. They must not have more clothes than necessary. Their clothes should be made of khadi. Other things must be as far as possible village-made or at least swadeshi.
 Everything must be kept in its proper place. All refuse must be put into the dust-bin.
 Water must not be wasted. Boiled water is used for drinking pur- poses. Pots and pans are finally washed with boiled water. Unboiled water of the Ashram wells is not safe to drink. It is necessary to learn the distinction between boiling water and hot water. Boiling water is that in which pulses are cooked; and which gives out lots of steam. No one can drink boiling water.
 We should not spit or clean the nose on the road, but only in an out-of-the-way place where no one is likely to walk.
 The call of nature must be attended to only at the appointed place. It is necessary to clean oneself after answering either call of nature. The water-jug used in the toilet is, as it should always be, set apart. After a visit to the latrine, we must wash our hands with pure earth and pure water, and wipe them with a clean napkin. The night- soil must be fully covered with dry earth so as not to attract flies and in such a way that nothing but dry earth is visible.
 One must sit carefully on the latrine seat, so that the seat does not get dirty and the stool drops into the receptacle. A lantern must be carried if it is dark.
Everything which can attract flies should be properly covered.
 Teeth must be cleaned with care at the proper place. The end of the twig must be well chewed into a soft brush, and the teeth and the gums must be brushed with it inside and out. The saliva discharged during brushing must be spat out. It must not be swallowed. After the teeth are well brushed the twig must be split into two to clean the tongue with. Then the mouth should be carefully washed. The nose also should be cleaned by drawing in water. The split twigs should be washed well, and collected in a pot. When they dry up they should be used for starting a fire, the idea being that nothing which can be used should be thrown away.
 Waste paper, which cannot be used for writing on the other side, should be burned. Nothing else should be mixed with it.
 The refuse from leafy vegetables must be kept separate and converted into manure.
 Broken glass should be thrown into a pit at a safe distance from houses.
 If anyone visits the Ashram or comes as a guest he should be received with love. He should not feel an outsider.
 In the Ashram everything should be in its proper place and every nook and corner should be clean. No dust should be allowed to collect on the doors, nor should they be sticky.
Everyone should do with great care the work allotted to him.
 No one should absent himself from a collective task. There should be the most scrupulous care in cleaning the utensils.
 The latrines should always be kept dry. The night-soil must always be covered with dry earth.
 Much water stagnates near the water-room; this is not good.
Food should always be kept covered, so that it does not attract flies.
 In the matter of food everyone should remember our vow about control of the palate, and eat all the things as medicine. We should not be perturbed if occasionally we miss an item. Whatever we get should be accepted as God’s grace.
 We should learn to understand correctly the meaning of our prayer. Take care of the Ashram property while you are using it, as if it were your own.

  BHAI 	KAKUBAI,  	I for one like your recommendation regarding the women. I have not 	spoken to Jajuji, I have not been able to see him.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : C.W. 10852. Courtesy : Purushottam K. 	Jerajani     INTERVIEW TO EVELYN WRENCHlibtech_552_footnote   [Before 	December 9, 1941]  Sir 	E. I 	recently had 	an hour-and-a-half 	talk with Mr. 	Jinnah and 	heard his 	point of view. I do not know what following he has, but he reiterated again and again  : 	“Never will Muslims be subservient to Hindu authority. You English 	and Germans are much closer to each other than Hindus and Muslims.” 	I would like to know what you have to say in regard to this.       
 GANDHIJI. I deny absolutely what Jinnah sahib says. The Muslim is as much an Indian as I am and of the same blood. There is no fundamental cleavage between Hindus and Musalmans. We have lived in the same land as brothers for generations and what has been  possible all these years will certainly be possible in the future. With due respect to Jinnasahib, he resorts unconsciously to an untruth when he says what you have just quoted, and speaks as a disappointed man does in order to maintain his view at any cost. In any case, the fear of subservience is quite imaginary. No one can dominate a population of 80,000,000. Can such a number be termed a minority? I personally would resist the subservience even of the Parsis, who are a mere handful, i.e., 1,00,000 , because I believe in equality for all and has throughout been the Congress creed. But I admit that Jinnah sahib’s fear though in fact imaginary is a real thing in his estimation, and therefore he has my sympathy.
 Sir E. What about the possibility of a free and equal India becoming a partner in the British Commonwealth in the sense that Canada and Australia are partners?
 G. Bitter experience has shown that India cannot be that in the sense that Canada and Australia are. At the moment the British Common-wealth is a Commonwealth of White nations. But I go a step further than you. Why only a British Commonwealth? Whoever is victor, there should be, after the war, a commonwealth of all nations. The British Commonwealth must give a place to this and no one must be excluded. Germany, Italy, Russia, all must come in, not only those who are today Allies of Britain. India will gladly be a member of such a common-wealth.
 Sir E. You are indulging in undue optimism. I worked seven years for the All Peoples Association in Europe and my experiences there during the last two decades do not lead to hope that the real internationalism is round the corner. Anyhow, your and my goal of universal brotherhood is common. Is it thus wise to destroy or abolish what has stood for a Commonwealth of at least some nations when the world is not ready for the ultimate ideal?
 G. It is not a question of abolition. It is a question of extending the scope of the British Commonwealth. If Britain wins wholly, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and perhaps even Bolshevik Russia will dis- appear. If Britain were honest, which I dispute, she would  then  embrace all nations on terms of equality.
 Sir E. According to the sentiments expressed in the Atlantic Charter?libtech_553_footnote
 
 G. What is the Atlantic Charter? It went down the ocean as soon as it was born ! I do not understand it. And Mr. Amery denies that India is fit for democracy, while Mr. Churchill says the Charter could not apply to India. Force of circumstances will falsify their declara- tions. Personally I like to believe that all become honest, the millen- nium is round the corner!
 Sir E. I know your views on pacifism. But all the same you won’t impede the British war effort?
 G. I said I would not embarrass Britain. And so far as civil disobedience is concerned, I have demonstrated that this is so. A non- violent man cannot desire embarrassment. And Government, in using the term “symbolic”libtech_554_footnotein their recent release of satyagrahis unsought by the satyagrahis have tacitly admitted non-embarrassment. Had Congress wished, it would have been possible to ignite a spark that would have swept right over India and which would certainly have deflected British energy from the war.
 Sir E. You want Britain to win, don’t you? Cannot you under any circumstances give active support to our war effort?
 G. I do not wish disaster to British arms. In saying this I may be said to have modified my original words. But I cannot give active support in the war effort without denying a life-time of practice.
 Sir E. Compared with fifteen years ago, has not British opinion moved favourably towards India? There are two powerful sections of public opinion in Great Britain today-one which holds that she should move closer to the U.S.A. and the Dominion with a view to forming a federation between these English-speaking democracies and definitely cut loose from India, which with its alien civilization they say has little in common with the Anglo-Saxons; the other consists of those who believe that the chief glory of the British Commonwealth is that it can admit nations  of any race, creed or colour to become partners within its orbit. Do you not trust us?  Do you not think that we are genuine when we see the difficulties inherent in the diffferent viewpoints of yourself and Mr. Jinnah? Would there not be civil war if we were to withdraw?
 
 Kingdom, stating certain common principles and policies on which the two leaders based their hopes for a better future for humankind after World War II. It condemned the use of force and territorial aggrandizement and defined the right of all peoples to self-determination and self-government. Though it was incorporated by reference in the declaration by the United Nations of January 1, 1942, the Atlantic Charter, like many war-time declarations, it was characterized more by vague generosity that by any precise commitment. Also vide footnot of “Interview to United Press of India”, 17-8-1941 and “Interview to H. V. Kamath”, 5-9-1941.
 
 G. I believe that a party wishing equality for India does exist in Britain. But it is an insignificant minority, and while I honour and like their opinion I cannot be enthused over it, for I know that those who shape policy and dominate are otherwise inclined. For me, therefore, it is only the Secretary of State who counts. I see no genuine ring in his statement. If he were honest he would not ask for an agreed solution among us as the first step. It is obvious that if Jinnasaheb asks me for things which I cannot give him, he will naturally go to the third party where he can get what he wants, as he did in London during the Round Table Conferencelibtech_555_footnote. The minority pact was there flung on us one fine morning unknown to any one of us. It is one of the most disgraceful chapters in British history. The Secretary of State should realize that the last word is in his hands. Hence it is that I have said you should retire and we shall have a pact in fifteen days. There may be civil war, it is highly probable there will be, but at the end of it there will be peace.
 Sir. E. At the end of all wars there is peace.
 G. You proposition was wrong. You can only have lasting peace based on justice. We are an unarmed people. Your armies are meant to suppress an armed rebellion and are not for use by us. The Indian troops are mercenaries and would be of no use in the civil war. It is the politically conscious Muslims and Hindus who will fight. They will fight with sticks, staves and soda-water bottles, but they will soon tire, and there will be wise men enough among us to bring about an honourable peace.
 Sir E. Are you not assuming too much?
 G. I assume nothing. These are daily happenings. There is breaking of each other’s heads for a couple of days and then there is peace.
 Sir E. But a Hindu cannot dine with a Muslim. Mr. Jinnah says these social barriers matter a good deal.
 G. They do not. You inter-dine and inter-marry with Germans and yet are both saturated with hate for each other.
 Sir E. May I take it that you would oppose Pakistan even if it were agreed upon by the Muslims and Britain?
G. No agreement between the British and Muslims can affect me.
An agreement between Hindus and Muslims alone will affect me.
 Sir E. Do you not think that Britain has stood for freedom and democracy–take Canada, Australia, South Africa?
 
 G. You have stood for these things simply for the spoilation of the weakers races. I have lived for twenty years in South Africa and I know the quarrel between you and the Dutch was over the sharing of the spoils and the same is happening elsewhere in Africa, too.
 Sir E. But very few are ready for a world Commonwealth. At what moment would you be willing to join a Commonwealth?
 G. When Africa, China, Japan are all included. I cannot be subservient anywhere.
 Sir E. Are you opposed to defence behind an international group?
G. I would agree to a minimum international police force.
 Sir E. What about an air-force?
 G. On no account. I look upon air-power for destruction as a terrible crime against humanity.
 Sir E. But if you do not agree to an armed force to stop aggression other Hitlers may arise.
 G. They will not arise if justice prevails. Hitler is a scourge sent by God to punish men for their iniquities.
 Sir E. Take the case of Abyssinia. If there had been an armed international force we could have stopped Mussolini from that conquest.
 G. You cannot cure a lesser evil by a greater evil. You might have succeeded in wiping out Italy, but how would that have helped? Britain’s success in the exploitaion of non-European races raised the ambition of Bismarck and later Mussolini and others.
 Sir E. But is not the mentality now passing? I assure you it is in England. Take the case of Iraq, to whom we have given independence.
G. I wish I could think that. I do not agree that there is freedom
 in Iraq today. I do not read current history as you do. Nothing is of a permanent nature. One can only talk of good intentions when the war is over. I would love to see that Iraq at least had real complete
independence after the war.
 Sir E. You may call me prejudiced, but Churchill has definitely announced that there will be no a acquisition of territory, etc.
 G. You are not prejudiced. You have perforce to believe what is told you. I have grave doubts. I mean no ill. Having given up arms, I can mean none. I never think of imaginary evils, however. There is no distrust of men and mankind in me. They will answer before God, so why should I worry? But where my own mission is concerned, my thought is active, and I try to wish everyone well in spite of doubts and mistrust. I will suffer the agony if that is to be my lot. But I may not
 
 unnerve myself while I can struggle against evil.
 Sir E. Try to believe there are more people in great Britain than you imagine in favour of India’s inclusion as a free partner in the British Commonwealth of Nations.   I can give you proof. There is the Labour Party.
G. I believe you are a growing party. All the same, I feel you are
 still insignificant. But you mention Labour Party, which is a dismal failure today. It takes its seat in the House of Lords!
 Sir E. After the war would you consider every problem if you felt India was to be free?

 Great Britain. I always have been. I have no axe to grind. Whatever I do is out of love.

  LETTER TO MRIDULA SARABHAI 
 SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,
    CHI. 	MRIDU,  December 	8, 1941 
  	I have your letter. I cannot bear to see you fall ill. One who wants 	to serve must acquire control over the body.  	There is nothing wrong in your involving yourself with  women’s 	organizations. You have to come in close contact with  women.  	We ourselves create obstacles for ourselves. Had you got rid of your 	fear, you would have come to stay at Sevagram earlier. People may 	not like to be here permanently. But I notice that many people have 	liked it at least for a few days.  	Miss Moore’s situation is as you have described. Having lived in 	the same social milieu, her ideas are unsympathetic. She appeared to 	me to be a good woman. She lived here very nicely. Now you may not 	have to go.

Courtesy : Sarabhai Foundation     STATEMENT TO THE PRESS   WARDHAGANJ,  December 9, 1941 In the 	midst of the human conflagration which envelops the world powers who 	believe in the strength of their arms, little knowing 
 what in reality they are fighting for, it is healthy and uplifting to contemplate what a man like Badshah Khan, the first among the Khidmatgars, is doing for the cause of peace and for  qualifying himself for taking an effective part by non-violent means in the freedom movement. He has undying faith in non-violence though he has not worked out all its implications. For the last few months, he has been holding little camps for non-violent training of Khudai Khid- matgars. But during the third week of November he held a biggish onelibtech_556_footnotelibtech_557_footnote, to which he had invited neighbouring workers from the Punjab, Kashmir and Baluchistan. Charkha was the important activity. Over three hundred wheels plied daily. Dhanush takli was also introduced in the camp. Its cheapness and the ease with which it could be manu- factured in every village appealed to everyone. Sanitation work was done in the surrounding villages and there were speeches explaining non-violence. A resolution was passed appealing to tribesmen to be peaceful and non-violent. Copies of it were printed for distribution among those tribesmen who came into British territory. Here is the daily routine :
 6 a.m.  azanlibtech_558_footnotelibtech_559_footnotefor prayers; from 6 to 7.30 prayers; from 7.30 to
 7.45 morning exercise; from 7.45 to 8 tea; from 8 to 10.55 village cleaning; from 11 to 12 noon, school; from 12 to 2 p.m. morning meal and rest; from 2 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. spinning; from 3.30 p.m. to
4.30 p.m. public meeting; 4.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. flag salutation; from 5
p.m. to 7 p.m. informal discussion; 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. evening meal; 8
p.m. to 9 p.m. roll call.
 Village cleaning was done in perfectly orderly manner. Workers were divided into several parties, carrying their own brooms. Villagers supplemented these from their own stock and joined Khidmatgars in this loving service. They did not leave out even police stations. Men in charge of these gratefully accepted the service.
 The camp worked like this for seven days from November 16 to
 22. There were about 20 Hindus and two women in  the  party. Badshah Khan, though ill himself, took part in every activity. The camp was of the simplest character. There were no servants. One medical man had volunteered his services which were most useful as many men were suffering from malaria. The Government had also sent a doctor with some medicines.
 
 
 The following was the daily menu: 7.45 a.m. tea and bread; 12 noon, bread made from wheat and maize with dal or vegetables; 7
p.m. ditto.
 The camp consisted of about five hundred representatives and guests from all over the N. W. F. Province. They were accommodated in little tents without side flaps. The total cost of running the camp was about Rs. 1,500. Congressmen and others could profitably copy the simplicity, economy and orderliness of this camp.

Effort for construction of independence so called through violent 	and, therefore, necessarily untruthful means we know only too 	painfully. Look at the daily destruction of property, life and truth 	in the present war.  	Complete independence through truth and non-violence means the 	independence of every unit, be it the humblest of the nation, with-     The 	version reproduced here was “thoroughly revised” and date-lined 	“Poona, 13-11-1945”.

 out distinction of race, colour or creed. This independence is never exclusive. It is, therefore, wholly compatible with interdepen-dence within or without. Practice will always fall short of the theory, even as the drawn line falls short of the theoretical line of Euclid. Therefore, complete independence will be complete only to the extent of our approach in practice to truth and non-violence.
 Let the reader mentally plan out the whole of the constructive programme, and he will agree with me that, if it could be successfully worked out, the end of it would be the independence we want. Has not Mr. Amery said that an agreement between the major parties, trans- lated in my language, any agreement after communal unity which is only one item in the constructive programme, will be respected? We need not question his sincerity, for if such unity is honestly, i.e., non- violently, attained, it will in itself contain the power to compel acceptance of the agreed demand.
 On the other hand there is no such thing as an imaginary or even perfect definition of independence through violence. For it pre- supposes only ascendancy of that party of the nation which makes the most effective use of violence. In it perfect equality, economic or otherwise, is inconceivable.
 But for my purpose, which is to convince the reader of the necessity of following out the constructive programme in the non- violent effort, the acceptance of my argument about the ineffective- ness of violence for the attainment of independence is not required. The reader is welcome to the belief that independence of this hum- blest unit is possible under a scheme of violence, if this effort enables him also to admit that it is a certainty through the complete execution of the programme by the nation.
Let us now examine the items :
 COMMUNAL UNITY 
 Everybody is agreed about the necessity of this unity. But everybody does not know that unity does not mean political unity, which may be imposed. It means an unbreakable heart unity. The first thing essential for achieving such unity is for every Congressman, whatever his religion may be, to represent in his own person Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Zoroastrian, Jew, etc., shortly, every Hindu and non-Hindu. He has to feel his identity with every one of the millions of the inhabitants of Hindustan. In order to realize this, every Con- gressman will cultivate personal friendship with persons represent-ing faiths other than his own. He should have the same regard for the other faiths as he has for his own.
 In such a happy state of things there would be no disgraceful cry at  the stations such as  “Hindu water” and “Muslim water” or “ Hindu tea” and “ Muslim tea”. There would be no separate rooms or pots for Hindus and non-Hindus in schools and colleges, no communal schools, colleges and hospitals. The beginning of such a revolution has to be made by Congressmen without any  political motive behind the correct conduct. Political unity will be its natural fruit.libtech_562_footnote
 We have long been accustomed to think that power comes only through Legislative Assemblies. I have regarded this belief as a grave error brought about by inertia or hypnotism. A superficial study of British history has made us think that all power percolates to the people from parliaments. The truth is that power resides in the people and it is entrusted for the time being to those whom they may choose as their representatives. Parliaments have no power or even existence independently of the people. It has been my effort for the last twenty- one years to convince the people of this simple truth. Civil disobe- dience is the storehouse of power. Imagine a whole people unwilling to conform to the laws of the legislature, and prepared to suffer the consequences of non-compliance. They will bring the whole legis- lative and executive machinery to a standstill. The police and the military are of use to coerce minorities however powerful they may be. But no police or military coercion can bend the resolute will of a people who are out for suffering to the uttermost.
 And parliamentary procedure is good only when its members are willing to conform to the will of the majority. In other words, it is fairly effective only among compatibles.
 Here in India we have been pretending to work the parlimentary system under separate electorates which have created artificial incom- patibles. Living unity can never come out of these artificial entities being brought together on a common platform. Such legislatures may function. But they can only be a platform for wrangling and sharing the crumbs of power that may fall from rulers whoever they may be. These rule with rod of iron, and prevent the opposing elements from flying at one another’s throats. I hold the emergence of complete independence to be an impossibility out of such a disgrace.
 
 Though I hold such strong views, I have come to the conclusion that so long as there are undersirable candidates for elective bodies, Congress should put up candidates in order to prevent reactionaries from entering such bodies.
 REMOVAL 	OF UNTOUCHABILITY 
 At this time of the day it is unnecessary to dilate upon the necessity of the removal of this blot and curse upon  Hinduism. Congressmen have certainly done much in this matter. But I am sorry to have to say that many Congressmen have looked upon this item as a mere political necessity and not something indispensable, so far as Hindus are concerned, for the very existence of Hinduism. If Hindu Congressmen take up the cause for its own sake, they will influence the so-called sanatanis far more extensively than they have hitherto done. They should approach them not in a militant spirit but, as befits their non-violence, in a spirit of friendliness. And so far as Harijans are concerned, every Hindu should make common cause with them and befriend them in their awful isolation—such isolation as perhaps the world has never seen in the monstrous immensity one witnesses in India. I know from experience how difficult the task is. But it is part of the task of building the edifice of swaraj. And the road to swaraj is steep and narrow. There are many slippery ascents and many deep chasms. They have all to be negotiated with unfaltering step before we can reach the summit and breathe the fresh air of freedom.
 PROHIBITION 
 Although like communal unity and removal of untouchability prohibition has been on the Congress programme  since 1920, Congressmen have not taken the interest they might have taken in this very vital social and moral reform. If we are to reach our goal through non-violent effort, we may not leave to the future government the fate of lakhs of men and women who are labouring under the curse of intoxicants and narcotics.
 Medical men can make a most effective contribution towards the removal of this evil. They have to discover ways of weaning the drunkard and the opium addict from the curse.
 Women and students have a special opportunity in advancing this reform. By many acts of loving service they can acquire on  addicts a hold which will compel them to listen to the appeal to give up the evil habit.
 Congress committees can open recreation booths where the tired labourer will rest his limbs, get healthy and cheap refreshments, and find suitable games. All this work is fascinating and uplifting. The
 non-violent approach to swaraj is a novel approach. In it old values give place to new. In the violent way such reforms may find no place. Believers in that way, in their impatience and, shall I say, ignorance, put off such things to the day of deliverance. They forget that lasting and healthy deliverance comes from within, i.e., from  self- purification. Constructive workers make legal prohibition easy and successful even if they do not pave the way for it.
 KHADI 
 Khadi is a controversial subject. Many people think that in advocating khadi I am sailing against a headwind and am sure to sink the ship of swaraj and that I am taking the country to the dark ages. I do not propose to argue the case for khadi in this brief survey. I have argued it sufficiently elsewhere. Here I want to show what every Congressman, and for that matter every Indian, can do to advance the cause of khadi. It connotes the beginning of economic freedom and equality of all in the country. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Let everyone try, and he or she will find out for himself or herself the truth of what I am saying. Khadi must be taken with all its implications. It means a wholesale swadeshi mentality, a determination to find all the necessaries of life in India and that too through the labour and intellect of the villagers. That means a reversal of the existing process. That is to say that, instead of half a dozen cities of India and Great Britain living on the exploitation and the ruin of the 7,00,000 villages of India, the latter will be largely self-contained, and will voluntarily serve the cities of India and even the outside world in so far as it benefits both the parties.
 This needs a revolutionary change in the mentality and tastes of many. Easy though the non-violent way is in many respects, it is very difficult in many others. It vitally touches the life of every single Indian, makes him feel aglow with the possession of a power that has lain hidden within himself, and makes him proud of his identity with every drop of the ocean of Indian humanity. This non-violence is not the inanity for which we have mistaken it through all these long ages; it is the most potent force as yet known to mankind and on which its very existence is dependent. It is that force which I have tried to present to the Congress and through it to the world. Khadi to me is the symbol of unity of Indian humanity, of its economic freedom and equality and, therefore, ultimately, in the poetic expression of Jawa- harlal Nehru, “the livery of India’s freedom”
 Moreover, khadi mentality means decentralization of the pro- duction and distribution of the necessaries of life. Therefore, the for-
 mula so far evolved is, every village to produce all its necessaries and a certain percentage in addition for the requirements of the cities.
 Heavy industries will needs be centralized and nationalized. But they will occupy the least part of the vast national activity which will mainly be in the villages.
 Having explained the implications of khadi, I must indicate what Congressmen can and should do towards its promotion. Production of khadi includes cotton-growing, picking, ginning, cleaning, carding, slivering, spinning, sizing, dyeing, preparing the warp and the woof, weaving, and washing. These, with the exception of dyeing, are essen- tial processes. Every one of them can be effectively handled in the villages and is being so handled in many villages throughout India, which the A.I.S.A. is covering. According to the latest report the following are the interesting figures :
 2,75,146 villagers, including 19,654 Harijans and 57,378 Mus- lims, scattered in at least 13,451 villages, received, as spinners, weavers, etc., Rs. 34,85,609 in 1940. The spinners were largely women.
 Yet the work done is only one-hundredth part of what could be done if Congressmen honestly took up the khadi programme. Since the wanton destruction of this central village industry and the allied handicrafts, intelligence and brightness have fled from the villages, leaving them inane, lustreless, and reduced almost to the state of their ill-kept cattle.
 If Congressmen will be true to the Congress call in respect of khadi, they will carry out the instructions of the A. I. S. A. issued from time to time as to the part they can play in khadi planning. Only  a few broad rules can be laid down here :
  Every 	family with 	a plot 	of ground 	can grow cotton 	at least 	for family 	use. Cotton-growing 	is an easy process. 	In Bihar 	the cultivators were 	by law 	compelled to 	grow indigo 	on 3/20 	of their 	cultivable land. 	This was in the 	interest of 	the foreign 	indigo planter. Why 	cannot we 	grow cotton 	voluntarily for 	the nation on 	a certain 	portion of 	our land? 	The reader will 	note that 	decentralization 	commences from 	the beginning of 	khadi processes. 	Today cotton crop 	is centralized 	and has to 	be sent to 	distant parts 	of India. 	Before the war it 	used to 	be sent principally 	to Britain 	and Japan. 	It was 	and still is 	a money 	crop and, therefore, 	subject to the 	fluctuations of 	the market. Under the 	khadi scheme 	cotton-growing becomes 	free from this 	uncertainty and 	gamble. The 	grower grows what he 	needs. The 	farmer needs to 	know that his first 	business is to grow 	for his own needs. 	When he 	does that, he 	will reduce 	the chance 	of a 	low market ruining him.  Every 	spinner would buy—if he 	has not his own—enough 	cotton for 	ginning, which 	he can 	easily do 	without the 	hand-ginning roller 	frame.  He 	 can  gin his  own  portion 	 with  a  board 	 and  an 	iron rolling-pin. 	Where this is 	considered 	impracticable, hand-ginned 	cotton should be 	bought and 	carded. Carding for 	self can 	be done 	well on 	a tiny 	bow without 	much effort. 	The greater 	the decentra- 	lization of 	labour, the 	simpler and 	cheaper the 	tools. The 	slivers made, 	the process 	of spinning 	commences. I 	strongly recommend 	the dhanush 	takli. I 	have used it 	frequently. My 	speed on 	it is almost the same as 	on the wheel. 	I draw 	a finer 	thread and the strength 	and the 	evenness of 	the yarn 	are greater 	on the 	dhanush takli than 	on the 	wheel. This 	may not, however, hold 	good for all. My 	emphasis on 	the dhanush 	takli is based 	on the 	fact that it is more 	easily made, is cheaper 	than and 	does not 	require frequent repairs 	like the 	wheel. Unless one knows how to make the two malslibtech_563_footnotelibtech_564_footnoteand to adjust them when they 	slip or to put 	the wheel right when it 	refuses to 	work, the wheel has often 	to lie idle. 	Moreover, if the 	millions take to 	spinning at 	once, as they well may have to,libtech_565_footnotelibtech_566_footnotethe  dhanush takli, being the  instrument 	most easily 	made and handled, 	is the 	only that can meet the demand. 	It is more 	easily made even than the 	simple takli. 	The best, 	easiest and cheapest way 	is to make 	it oneself. 	Indeed one ought to 	learn how to handle and 	make simple 	tools. Imagine the 	unifying and 	educative effect 	of the 	whole nation 	simultaneously taking part 	in the 	processes up 	to spinning ! 	Consider the 	levelling effect of 	the bond of 	common labour 	between the rich 	and the poor ! 
 Yarn thus produced may be used in three ways : by presenting it to the A.I.S.A. for the sake of the poor, by having it woven for personal use, or by getting as much khadi for it as it can buy. It is clear enough that the finer and better the yarn the greater will be its value. If Congressmen will put their hearts into the work, they will make improvements in the tools and make many discoveries. In our country there has been a divorce between labour and intelligence. The result has been stagnation. If there is an indissoluble marriage between the two, and that in the manner here suggested, the resultant good will be inestimable.
 In this scheme of nationwide spinning as a sacrifice, I do not expect the average man or woman to give more than one hour daily to this work.
 
 
   OTHER 		VILLAGE INDUSTRIES  
 These stand on a different footing from khadi. There is not much scope for voluntary labour in them. Each industry will take the labour of only a certain number of hands. These industries come in as a handmaid to khadi. They cannot exist without khadi, and khadi will be robbed of its dignity without them. Village economy cannot be complete without the essential village industries such as hand-grind- ing, hand-pounding, soap-making, paper-making, match-making, tanning, oil-pressing, etc. Congressmen can  interest  themselves  in these and, if they are villagers or will settle down in villages, they will give these industries a new life and a new dress. All should make it a point of honour to use only village articles whenever and wher-ever available. Given the demand there is no doubt that most of our wants can be supplied from our villages. When we have become village- minded , we will not want imitations of the West or machine-made products, but we will develop a true national taste in keeping with the vision of a new India in which pauperism, starvation and idleness will be unknown.
  VILLAGE SANITATION  
 Divorce between intelligence and labour has resulted in criminal negligence of the villages. And so, instead of having graceful hamlets dotting the land, we have dung-heaps. The approach to many villages is not a refreshing experience. Often one would like to shut one’s eyes and stuff one’s nose; such is the surrounding dirt and offending smell. If the majority of Congressmen were derived from our villages, as they should be, they should be able to make our villages models of cleanliness in every sense of the word. But they have never considered it their duty to identify themselves with the villagers in their daily lives. A sense of national or social sanitation is not a virtue among us. We may take a kind of a bath, but we do not mind dirtying the well or the tank or river by whose side or in which we perform ablutions. I regard this defect as a great vice which is responsible for the disgraceful state of our villages and the sacred banks of the sacred rivers and for diseases that spring from insanitation.
  NEW OR BASIC EDUCATION  
 This is a new subject. But the members of the Working Committee felt so much interested in it that gave a charter to the organizers of the Hindustani Talimi Sangh which has been function- ing since the Haripura sessionlibtech_567_footnotelibtech_568_footnote. This is a big field of work for many
 
 Congressmen. This education is meant to transform village children into model villagers. It is principally designed for them. The inspiration for it has come from the villages. Congressmen who want to build up the structure of swaraj from its very foundation dare not neglect the children. Foreign rule has unconsciously, though none the less surely, begun with the children in the field of education. Primary education is a farce designed without regard to the wants of the India of the villages and for that matter even of the cities. Basic education links the children, whether of the cities or the villages, to all that is best and lasting in India. It develops both the body and the mind, and keeps the child rooted to the soil with a glorious vision of the future, in the realization of which he or she begins to take his or her share from the very commencement of his or her career in school. Congressmen would find it of absorbing interest benefiting themselves equally with the children with whom they come in contact. Let those who wish put themselves in touch with the Secretary of the Sangh at Sevagram.
  ADULT EDUCATION  
 This has been woefully neglected by Congressmen. Where they have not neglected it, they have been satisfied with teaching illiterates to read and write. If I had charge of adult education, I should begin with opening the minds of the adult pupils to the greatness and  vastness of their country. The villager’s India is contained in his village. If he goes to another village, he talks of his own village as his home. Hindustan is for him a geographical term. We have no notion of the ignorance prevailing in the villages. The villagers know nothing of foreign rule and its evils. What little knowledge they have picked up fills them with the awe the foreigner inspires. The result is the dread and hatred of the foreigner and his rule. They do not know how to get rid of it. They do not know that the foreigner’s presence is due to their own weaknesses and their ignorance of the power they possess to rid themselves of the foreign rule. My adult education means, therefore, first, true political education of the adult by word of mouth. Seeing that this will be mapped out, it can be given without fear. I imagine that it is too late in the day for authority to interfere with this type of education; but if there is interference, there must be a fight for this elementary right without which there can be no swaraj. Of course, in all I have written, openness has been assumed. Non-violence abhors fear and, therefore, secrecy. Side by side with the education by the mouth will be the literary education. This is itself a speciality. Many methods are being tried in order to shorten the period of education. A temporary or permanent board of experts may be appointed by the
 
 Working Committee to give shape to the idea here adumbrated and guide the workers. I admit that what I have said in this paragraph only points the way but does not tell the average Congressman how to go about it. Nor is every Congressman fitted for this highly special work. But Congressmen who are teachers should find no difficulty in laying down a course in keeping with the suggestions made herein.
  WOMEN  
 I have included service of women in the constructive pro- gramme, for though satyagraha has automatically brought India’s women out from their darkness as nothing else could have in such an incredibly short space of time, Congressmen have not felt the call to see that women become equal partners in the fight for swaraj. They have not realized that woman must be the true helpmate of man in the mission of service. Woman has been suppressed under custom and law for which man was responsible and in the shaping of which she had no hand. In a plan of life based on non-violence, woman has as much right to shape her own destiny as man has to shape his. But as every right in a non-violent society proceeds from the previous performance of a duty, it follows that rules of social conduct must be framed by mutual co-operation and consultation. They can never be imposed from outside. Men have not realized this truth in its fulness in their behaviour towards women. They have considered themselves to be lords and masters of women instead of considering them as their friends and co-workers. It is the privilege of Congressmen to give the women of India a lifting hand. Women are in the position somewhat of the slave of old who did not know that he could or ever had to be free. And when freedom came, for the moment he felt  helpless. Women have been taught to regard themselves as slaves of men. It is up to Congressmen to see that they enable them to realize their full status and play their part as equals of men.
 This revolution is easy, if the mind is made up. Let Congress- men begin with their own homes. Wives should not be dolls and objects of indulgence, but should be treated as honoured comrades in common service. To this end those who have not received a liberal education should receive such instruction as is possible from their husbands. The same observation applies, with the necessary changes, to mothers and daughters.
 It is hardly necessary to point out that I have given a onesided picture of the helpless state of India’s women. I am quite conscious of the fact that in the villages generally they hold their own with their menfolk and in some respects even rule them. But to the impartial
 outsider the legal and customary status of woman is bad enough throughout and demands radical alteration.
  EDUCATION IN HEALTH AND HYGIENE  
 Having given a place to village sanitation, the question may be asked why give a separate place to education in health and hygiene? It might have been bracketed with sanitation, but I did not wish to interfere with the items. Mention of mere sanitation is not enough to include health and hygiene. The art of keeping one’s health and the knowledge of hygiene is by itself a separate subject of study and corresponding practice. In a well-ordered society the citizens know and observe the laws of health and hygiene. It is established beyond doubt that ignorance and neglect of the laws of health and hygiene are responsible for the majority of diseases to which mankind is heir. The very high death-rate among us is no doubt due largely to our gnawing poverty, but it could be mitigated if the people were properly educated about health and hygiene.
 Mens sana in corpore sano is perhaps the first law for humanity. A healthy mind in a healthy body is a self-evident truth. There is an inevitable connection between mind and body.  If we were in possession of healthy minds, we would shed all violence and, naturally obeying the laws of health, we would have healthy bodies without an effort. I hope, therefore, that no Congressman will disregard this item of the constructive programme. The fundamental laws of health and hygiene are simple and easily learnt. The difficulty is about their observance. Here are some :
 Think the purest thoughts and banish all idle and impure thoughts.
Breathe the freshest air day and night.
Establish a balance between bodily and mental work.
 Stand erect, sit erect, and be neat and clean in every one of your acts, and let these be an expression of your inner condition.
 Eat to live for service of fellow-men. Do not live for indulging yourselves. Hence your food must be just enough to keep your mind and body in good order. Man becomes what he eats.
 Your water, food and air must be clean, and you will not be satisfied with mere personal cleanliness, but you will infect your surroundings with the same threefold cleanliness that you will desire for yourselves.
   PROVINCIAL LANGUAGESlibtech_569_footnote  
 Our love of the English language in preference to our own mother tongue has caused a deep chasm between the educated and politically-minded classes and the masses. The languages of India have suffered impoverishment. We flounder when we make the vain attempt to express abstruse thought in the mother tongue. There are no equivalents for scientific terms. The result has been disastrous. The masses remain cut off from the modern mind. We are too near our own times correctly to measure the disservice caused to India by this neglect of its great languages. It is easy enough to understand that unless we undo the mischief the mass mind must remain imprisoned. The masses can make no solid contribution to the construction of swaraj. It is inherent in swaraj based on non-violence that every individual makes his own direct contribution to the Independence movement. The masses cannot do this fully unless they understand every step with all its implications. This is impossible unless every step is explained in their own languages.
  NATIONAL LANGUAGE  
 And then for all-India intercourse we need, from among the Indian stock, a language which the largest number of people already know and understand and which the others can easily pick up. This language is indisputably Hindi. It is spoken and understood by both Hindus and Muslims of the North. It is called Urdu when it is written in the Urdu character. The Congress, in its famous resolution passed at the Cawnpore session in 1925, called this all-India speech Hindustani. And since that time, in theory at least, Hindustani has been the Rashtra-bhasha. I say “in theory” because even Congressmen have not practised it as they should have.libtech_570_footnotelibtech_571_footnoteIn 1920 a deliberate attempt was begun to recognize the importance of Indian languages for the political education of the masses, as also of an all-India common speech which politically-minded India could easily speak and which Congressmen from the different provinces could understand at all- India gatherings of the Congress. Such national language should enable one to understand and speak both forms of speech and write in both the scripts.
 I am sorry to have to say that many Congressmen have failed to carry out that resolution. And so we have, in my opinion, the shameful
 
 spectacle of Congressmen insisting on speaking in English and compelling others to do likewise for their sakes. The spell that English has cast on us is not yet broken. Being under it, we are impeding the progress of India towards her goal. Our love of the masses must be skin-deep, if we will not take the trouble of spending over learning Hindustani as many months as the years we spend over learning English.libtech_572_footnote
  ECONOMIC EQUALITY  
 This last is the master-key to non-violent independence. Work- ing for economic equality means abolishing the eternal conflict between capital and labour. It means the levelling down of the few rich in whose hands is concentrated the bulk of the nation’s wealth on the one hand, and the levelling up of the semi-starved naked millions on the other. A non-violent system of government is clearly an impossibility so long as the wide gulf between the rich and the hungry millions persists. The contrast between the palaces of New Delhi and the miserable hovels of the poor labouring class nearby cannot last one day in a free India in which the poor will enjoy the same power as the richest in the land. A violent and bloody revolution is a certainty one day unless there is a voluntary abdication of riches and the power that riches give and sharing them for the common good.
 I adhere to my doctrine of trusteeship in spite of the ridicule that has been poured upon it. It is true that it is difficult to reach. So is non-violence. But we made up our minds in 1920 to negotiate that steep ascent. We have found it worth the effort. It involves a daily growing appreciation of the working of non-violence. It is expected that Congrssmen will make a diligent search and reason out for themselves the why and the wherefore of libtech_573_footnotenon-violence. They should ask themselves how the existing inequalities can be abolished violently or non-violently. I think we know the violent way. It has not succeeded anywhere.libtech_574_footnote
 
 country.”
 with the instructions issued from time to time.”
 This non-violent experiment is still in the making. We have nothing much yet to show by way of demonstration. It is certain, however, that the method has begun to work though ever so slowly in the direction of equality. And since non-violence is a process of conversion, the conversion, if achieved, must be permanent. A society or a nation constructed non-violently must be able to withstand attack upon its structure from without or within. We have moneyed Congressmen in the organization. They have to lead the way. This fightlibtech_575_footnotelibtech_576_footnoteprovides an opportunity for the closest heart-searching on the part of every individual Congressman. If ever we are to achieve equality, the foundation has to be laid now. Those who think that major reforms will come after the advent of swaraj are deceiving themselves as to the elementary working of non-violent swaraj. It will not drop from heaven all of a sudden one fine morning. But it has to be built up brick by brick by corporate self-effort. We have travelled a fair way in that direction. But a much longer and weary distance has to be covered before we can behold swaraj in its glorious majesty. Every Congressman has to ask himself what he has done towards the attainment of economic equality.
  KISANSlibtech_577_footnote  
 The programme is not exhaustive. Swaraj is a mighty structure. Eighty crores of hands have to work at building it.libtech_578_footnoteOf these  kisans, i.e., the peasantry, are the largest part. In fact, being the bulk of them (probably over 80%) the kisans should be the Congress. But they are not. When they become conscious of their non-violent strength, no power on earth can resist them.
 
 “The reader will notice, as some of my co-workers have noticed, the absence  of any reference of kisans, factory hands or labour and students. I have deliberately avoided reference to their work as parts of the constructive programme. They have to work the thirteen items same as any other worker in the cause. My avoidance is not intended to belittle the part they can play in the movement. I am quite conscious of the great importance they have in the movement for  freedom.  The  question  underlying the inquiry is who is to organize them and how.”
 They must not be used for power politics.libtech_579_footnotelibtech_580_footnoteI  consider  it  to  be contrary to the non-violent method. Those who would know my method of organizing kisans may profitably study the movement in Champaran when satyagraha was tried for the first time in India with the result all India knows. It became a mass movement which remained wholly non-violent from start to finish. It affected over twenty lakhs of kisans. The struggle centred round one specific grievance which was a century old. There had been several violent revolts to get rid of the grievance. The kisans were suppressed. The non-violent remedy succeeded in full in six months. The kisans of Champaran became politically conscious without any direct effort. The tangible proof they had of the working of non-violence to remove their grievances drew them to the Congress and led by Babu Brijkishore Prasad and Babu Rajendra Prasad they gave a good  account of themselves during the past civil disobedience campaigns.
 The reader may also profitably study the kisan movements in Kheda , Bardoli and Borsad . The secret of success lies in a refusal to exploit the kisans for political purposes outside their own personal and felt grievances. Organization round a specific wrong they understand. They need no sermons on non-violence. Let them learn to apply non-violence as an effective remedy which they can under- stand, and later when they are told that the method they were applying was non-violent, they readily recognize it as such.
 Form these illustrations Congressmen who care could study how work can be done for and among kisans. I hold that the method that some Congressmen have followed to organize kisans has done them no good and has probably harmed them. Anyway they have not used the non-violent method. Be it said to the credit of some of these workers that they frankly admit that they do not believe in the non- violent method. My advice to such workers would be that they should neither use the Congress name nor work as Congressmen.
 The reader will now understand why I have refrained from the competition to organize kisans and labour on an all-India basis. How I wish that all hands pulled in the same direction ! But perhaps in a huge country like ours it is impossible. Anyway, in non-violence there is no coercion. Cold reason and demonstration of the working of non- violence must be trusted to do the work.
 In my opinion, like labour, they should have under the Congress a department working for their specific questions.
 
   LABOUR  
 Ahmedabad Labour Union is a model for all India to copy.libtech_581_footnoteIts basis is non-violence, pure and simple. It has never had a set-back in its career. It has gone on from strength to strength without fuss and without show. It has its hospital, its school for the children of the mill- hands, its classes for adults, its own printing press and khadi depot, and its own residential quarters. Almost all the hands are voters and decide the fate of elections. They came on the voters’ list at the instance of the Provincial Congress Committee. The organization has never taken part in party politics of the Congress. It influences the municipal policy of the city. It has to its credit very successful strikes
 which were wholly non-violent. Mill-owners and  labour  have governed their relations largely through voluntary arbitration. If I had my way, I would regulate all the labour organizations of India after the Ahmedabad model. It has never sought to intrude itself upon the All-India Trade Union Congress and has been uninfluenced by that Congress. A time, I hope, will come when it will be possible for the Trade Union Congress to accept the Ahmedabad method and have the Ahmedabad organization as part of the All-India Union. But I am in no hurry. It will come in its own time.
  ADIVASISlibtech_582_footnote  
 The term  adivasi, like raniparajlibtech_583_footnote, is a coined word.  Raniparaj stands for kaliparaj (meaning black people, though their skin is no more black than that of any other). It was conined, I think, by Shri Jugatram. The term adivasi (for Bhils, Gonds, or others variously described as Hill Tribes or aboriginals) means literally original inhabitants and was coined, I believe, by Thakkar Bapa.
 Service of adivasis is also a part of the constructive programme. Though they are the sixteenth number in this programme, they are not the least in point of importance. Our country is so vast and the races so varied that the best of us cannot know all there is to know of men and their condition. As one discovers this for oneself,  one  realizes how difficult it is to make good our claim to be one nation,
 
 unless every unit has a living consciousness of being one with every other.
 The adivasis are over two crores in all India. Bapa began work among the Bhils years ago in Gujarat. In about 1940 Shri Balasaheb Kher threw himself with his usual zeal into this much-needed service in the Thana District. He is now President of the Adivasi Seva Mandal.
 There are several such other workers in other parts of India and yet are too few. Truly, “the harvest is rich but the labourers are few”. Who can deny that all such service is not merely humanitarian but solidly national, and brings us nearer to true independence?
  LEPERS  
 Leper is a word of bad odour. India is perhaps a home of lepers next only to Central Africa. Yet they are as much a part of society as the tallest among us. But the tall absorb our attention though they are least in need of it. The lot of the lepers who are much in need of attention is studied neglect. I am tempted to call it heartless, which it certainly is in terms of non-violence. It is largely the missionary who, be it said to his credit, bestows care on him. The only institution run by an Indian, as a pure labour of love, is by Shri Manohar Diwan near Wardha. It is working under the inspiration and guidance of Shri Vinoba Bhave. If India was pulsating with new life, if we were all in earnest about winning independence in the quickest manner possible by truthful and non-violent means, there would not be a leper or beggar in India uncared for and unaccounted for. In this revised edition I am deliberately introducing the leper as a link in the chain of constructive effort. For what the leper is in India, that we are, if we put look about us, for the modern civilized world. Examine the condition of our brethren across the ocean and the truth of my remark will be borne home to us.
  STUDENTS  
 I have reserved students to the last. I have always cultivated close contact with them. They know me and I know them. They have given me service. Many ex-collegians are my esteemed co-workers. I know that they are the hope of the future. In the heyday of non-co- operation they were invited to leave their schools and colleges. Some professors and students who responded to the Congress call have remained steadfast and gained much for the country and themselves. The call has not been repeated for there is not the atmosphere for it. But experience has shown that the lure of the current  education,  though it  is  false and unnatural, is  too much for the youth  of  the
 
 country. College education provides a career. It is a passport for entrance to the charmed circle. Pardonable hunger for knowledge cannot be satisfied otherwise than by going through the usual rut. They do not mind the waste of precious years in acquiring knowledge of an utterly foreign language which takes the place of the mother tongue. The sin of it is never felt. They and their teachers have made up their minds that the indigenous languages are useless for gaining access to modern thought and the modern sciences. I wonder how the Japanese are faring. For their education, I understand, is all given in Japanese. The Chinese Generalissimo knows very little, if anything, of English.
 But such as the students are, it is from these young men and women that the future leaders of the nation are to rise. Unfortunately they are acted upon by every variety of influences. Non-violence offers them little attraction. A blow for a blow or two for one is an easily understandable proposition. It seems to yield immediate result though momentary. It is a never-ending trial of brute strength as we see in time of war among brutes or among human beings. Appre- ciation of non-violence means patient research and still more patient and difficult practice. I have not entered the list of competitors for the students’ hand, for the reasons that have dictated my course about kisans and labour. But I am myself a fellow-student, using the word in its broader sense. My university is different from theirs. They have a standing invitation from me to come to my university and join me in my search. Here are the terms :
  Students 	must not 	take part 	in party 	politics. They 	are students, searchers, 	not politicians.  They 	may not resort 	to political 	strikes. They 	must have their 	heroes, but their 	devotion to them 	is to be shown 	by copying 	the best 	in their heroes, 	not by 	going on 	strikes, if the heroes 	are imprisoned 	or die 	or are 	even sent to 	the gallows. 	If their 	grief is 	unbearable and 	if all the students feel 	equally, schools or 	colleges may 	be closed 	on such 	occasions, with the 	consent of 	their principals. If 	the principals 	will not 	listen, it is open 	to the students to leave 	their institutions in 	a becoming 	manner till the managers 	repent and recall 	them. On 	no account may 	they use coercion 	against dissentients of 	against the 	authorities. They 	must have the confidence 	that if 	they are 	united and 	dignified in 	their conduct, they are 	sure to win.  They 	must all do sacrificial 	spinning in a 	scientific manner. 	Their tools 	shall be always neat, clean, and 	in good 	order and 	condition. If 	possible, they 	will learn to 	make them themselves. 	Their yarn will 	naturally be 	of the 	highest quality. 	They will 	study the 
 literature about spinning with all its economic, social, moral and political implications.
  They 	will be khadi-users 	all through 	and use village 	pro- ducts 	to the 	exclusion of 	all analogous 	things, foreign or 	machine made.  They 	may not impose 	Vandemataram or 	the national 	flag on 	others. They 	may wear national flag 	buttons on 	their own persons 	but not force 	others to do the same.  They 	can enforce 	the message 	of the 	tricolour flag 	in their own persons 	and harbour 	neither communalism nor 	untouchability in 	their hearts. They 	will cultivate real 	friendship with 	students of 	other faiths and with Harijans as if they were their own kith and kin.  They 	will make it a 	point to 	give first 	aid to 	their injured neighbours 	and do scavenging 	and cleaning 	in the neighbouring 	villages and 	instruct village 	children and adults.  They 	will learn 	the national 	language, Hindustani, 	in its present double 	dress, two forms 	of speech 	and two scripts, 	so that 	they may 	feel at 	home whether 	Hindi or 	Urdu is 	spoken and 	Nagari or 	Urdu script is written.  They 	will translate into 	their own 	mother tongue everything 	new they 	may learn, 	and transmit 	it in their 	weekly rounds 	to the surrounding villages.  They 	will do nothing 	in secret, 	they will be 	above board in 	all their 	dealings, they 	will lead a pure 	life of self-restraint, 	shed all 	fear and 	be always 	ready to protect 	their weak fellow-students, and 	be ready 	to quell 	riots by non-violent 	conduct at 	the risk 	of their 	lives. And 	when the 	final heat of 	the struggle 	comes, they will leave 	their institutions 	and, if 	need be, 	sacrifice themselves for 	the freedom of 	their country.  They 	will be scrupulously 	correct and 	chivalrous in 	their behaviour towards 	their girl fellow-students. 
 For working out the programme I have sketched for them, the students must find time. I know that they waste a great deal of time in idleness. By strict economy, they can save many hours. But I do not want to put an undue strain upon any student. I would, therefore, advise patriotic students to lose one year, not at a stretch but spread it over their whole study. They will find that one year so given will not be a waste of time. The effort will add to their equipment, mental, moral and physical, and they will have made even during their studies a substantial contribution to the freedom movement.
 
 PLACE OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
 I have said in these pages that civil disobedience is not absolutely necessary to win freedom through purely non-violent  effort, if the co-operation of the whole nation is secured in the constructive programme. But such good luck rarely favours nations or individuals. Therefore, it is necessary to know the place of civil disobedience in a nationwide non-violent effort.
It has three definite functions :
 It can be effectively offered for the redress of a local wrong.  It 	can be 	offered without regard 	to effect, 	though aimed at a 	particular wrong 	or evil, 	by way 	of self-immolation 	in order 	to rouse 	local consciousness 	or conscience. 	Such was 	the case in 	Champaran when 	I offered 	civil disobedience without any 	regard to 	the effect 	and well 	knowing that 	even the people might 	remain apathetic. That 	it proved 	otherwise may be taken, 	according to taste, 	as God’s 	grace or a stroke 	of good luck.  In 	the place 	of full 	response to 	constructive effort, it 	can be 	offered as it was in 1941libtech_584_footnotelibtech_585_footnote. Though it was a contribution to and part of the battle 	for freedom, 	it was 	purposely centred round 	a particular 	issue, i.e., free 	speech. Civil 	disobedience can never 	be directed 	for a 	general cause such 	as for 	independence. The 	issue must 	be definite 	and capable 	of being 	clearly understood and 	within the 	power of 	the opponent 	to yield. 	This method 	properly applied must 	lead to the final goal. 
 I have not examined here the full scope and possibilities of civil disobedience. I have touched enough of it to enable the reader to understand the connection between the constructive programme and civil disobedience. In the first two cases, no elaborate constructive programme was or could be necessary. But when civil disobedience is itself devised for the attainment of independence, previous preparation is necessary, and it has to be backed by the visible and conscious effort of those who are engaged in the battle. Civil disobedience is thus a stimulation for the fighters and a challenge to the opponent. It should be clear to the reader that civil disobedience in terms of independence without the co-operation of the millions by way of constructive effort is mere bravado and worse than useless.
 CONCLUSION
 This is not a thesis written on behalf of the Congress or at the instance of the Central Office. It is the outcome of conversations I had
 
 with some co-workers in Sevagram. They had felt the want of some- thing from my pen showing the connection between the constructive programme and civil disobedience and how the former might be worked. I have endeavoured to supply the want in this pamphlet. It does not purport to be exhaustive, but it is sufficiently indicative of the way the programme should be worked.
 Let not the reader make the mistake of laughing at any of the items as being part of the movement for independence. Many people do many things, big and small, without connecting them with non- violence or independence. They have then their limited value as expected. The same man appearing as a civilian may be of no consequence, but appearing in his capacity as General he is a big personage, holding the lives of millions at his mercy. Similarly, the charkha in the hands of a poor widow brings a paltry pice to her, in the hands of a Jawaharlal it is an instrument of India’s freedom. It is the office which gives the charkha its dignity. It is the office assigned to the constructive programme which gives it an irresistible prestige and power.
 Such at least is my view. It may be that of a mad man. If it makes no appeal to the Congressman, I must be rejected. For my handling of civil disobedience without the constructive programme will be like a paralysed hand attempting to lift a spoon.
 Constructive Programme : Its Meaning and Place
 
   THE PLACE OF SILK  
Shri Jajuji writes :libtech_586_footnote
 All these are good points. They have also been pretty well discussed. But some questions are raised again and again and need to be discussed again and again.
 I shall answer the questions in the order in which they have been asked.
  The 	question of 	violence and 	non-violence does 	arise, for 	there is 	violent silk 	and non-violent 	silk. The 	best thing of 	course is 	for people who like to consider everything from the point of view of 
 
 non-violence to give up silk altogether.
 But from the point of view of khadi we should not raise this question. We should stock both kinds of silk in our bhandars, though we should give encouragement only to non-violent silk.
  We 	should never allow silk 	to reach 	a point 	where it can compete 	with khadi. 	The idea behind 	giving a place 	to silk 	was that it should 	supplement khadi. It has 	also been the 	view that hand-spun silk 	is always 	to be preferred 	to foreign 	silk and 	silk manufactured 	in Indian 	mills. But silk 	must never be given 	the place 	of cotton 	cloth. That 	is why 	a limit 	has been 	put upon 	the quantity 	of silk to be stocked 	in khadi bhandars.  This 	is not 	an important 	point. In a 	way even Andhra 	khadi, coloured 	khadi and khadi 	with woven 	designs make us 	luxury-loving. Khadi 	is as much 	for the fastidious 	as it is for 	the poor. From the 	very beginning 	it has 	been our endeavour to 	introduce into 	khadi as much 	beauty and 	decoration as 	we can. We 	display this 	at every khadi 	exhibition. We 	have been 	showing progress 	in  the  appearance 	 of khadi 	every year. This was and 	still is 	the correct 	[attitude]. Khadi- 	mindedness does not 	mean that art 	and design should have 	no place 	in khadi, 	and that 	it is to be only 	the attire 	of the 	poor. Therefore the 	restraint we 	should place on 	ourselves here is 	that we 	should put 	what art and design 	we can 	into khadi and 	be satisfied. 	From this point of 	view silk is 	to be and should 	be discarded. 	From this point of view 	too we 	compare the 	fine Andhra khadi with 	silk. Then 	the silk-lovers say 	they find silk cheaper 	than the Andhra 	khadi. I answer 	that we 	cannot advance 	the work 	of khadi 	in this 	way. Khadi, though it 	may be costly, comes 	out cheap 	in the end.  If 	silk-making calls 	for twice 	as large 	a capital 	outlay, we have 	a very 	strong reason 	for giving 	it up. 	But having 	regard to 	 human nature we 	do not or cannot 	wholly renounce 	silk. In 	our definition 	of khadi 	we have 	given a 	place to 	hand-spun silk 	and hand- spun 	wool. But we 	cannot encourage 	woollens and silk 	with a view 	to increasing 	profits. There will have 	to be some 	restraint in 	regard to 	these. Service of the millions is possible only through cotton khadi.

    LETTER TO AMRITA LAL CHATTERJEE        BARDOLI, 
     MY 	DEAR AMRITLAL,  December 	15, 1941 
  	Of course I will try to show you how utterly wrong you are. But when 	a man believes in a different philosophy from the one another 	subscribes to, it is difficult for that other to carry conviction. 	Such is my plight.  	You quote from the Bible but your application is quite new and 	utterly selfish. You turn a donation into a debt. What is to be 	done? I brought you out of Bengal because you were disgusted and now 	you think that you did me a favour in coming out.  	Of course a labourer is worthy of his hire. You want money without 	work. And when you do work, you want more  than  the highest you and 	I have agreed upon, viz., 8 as. for 8 hours’ work. But you think 	you have a claim upon me, i.e., society, for Rs. 2-12 per day for 	practically very little work. Let me not be misunderstood. I know 	Abha is doing something, so also perhaps you. But your letter shows 	that even if all of you were doing nothing, you will claim the above 	amount as if it was a right. I suggest to you that you are wholly 	wrong in making the claim and defending it on high morality. My 	notion is different. I must not carry the argument any further.  	God will give you light if you are humble and will seek it in the 	right spirit. 
 If my letter does not convince, you should wait till we can meet some day, if ever we do. Meanwhile we must agree to differ.
Love.

      LETTER TO CHANDAN S. KALELKAR    December 	15, 1941  CHI. 	CHANDAN,  	I am glad that you wrote to me, though only from a selfish motive.libtech_590_footnotelibtech_591_footnoteYou 	would certainly have money in Baroda, but your Prince may have to 	sell his soul there. Occasions may arise in Indian States when, if 	you refuse to obey the State’s order, you would in no time find 	yourself disgraced. That is why, when an opportunity arose earlier, 	it was decided that a hundred rupees else-where would be preferable 	to a lakh in an Indian State. You will not get elsewhere the 	opportunity for service which you two have in Kashi. Did you not 	know, when you decided to marry Shankar, that he was a poor man’s 	son and had grown up in simplicity, that he was a man of 	self-respect and that he would be prepared to sacrifice his all for 	the sake of his honour? Yes, he might welcome comfort if he can have 	it by straightforward means. Perhaps there is this difference 	between Kaka and him.  	See that you do not tempt Shankar. If he is patient, he will rise 	where he is at present. What he earns is enough to meet your needs. 	Have patience. Remember the line “Be equiminded in happiness and 	suffering, for they are born with the body”, and let Shankar 	follow his straight path.  	You and Baby will be well.

    From 	a photostat : G.N. 10860      SPEECH AT A. I. S. A. MEETING    BAPU        BARDOLI, 
  December 17, 1941 I had   	received  Jajuji’s  letterlibtech_597_footnotelibtech_598_footnotemany 	 days  ago.  I  liked  many things in the letter. But I feel that we 	should have some discussion on  	the letter today. If I were to put down the things that Jajuji has 	said in his letter, my language would have been a little different 	though the substance would have been the same. The principles he has 	enunciated are sound. It is another matter to what extent they can 	be put into practice. But it is better that we clearly understand 	the principles. When the principles have been clearly formulated we 	are able to look at things in a uniform way. There is then no room 	left for disagree- ments. If there is some slackness in practice we 	must  put  in  more     
 effort. What else could we do but make the effort?
 As Jajuji has pointed out, no matter how much khadi  we produce, if we have not understood the principles behind khadi, khadi work is bound to languish. India wore khadi even before. Indeed, we exported khadi to the biggest countries of the world. But we cannot pride ourselves upon it today. Khadi then was not associated with politics. Kings and officials, out of avarice, forced the poor to part with khadi and sold it to make themselves rich. This makes it difficult for us even today to explain khadi activity to the masses.
 But today we agree that khadi is the means to our freedom. This first occurred to me in 1908. The very thing that was a cause of our slavery will open the door to our freedom. We have to understand this.
 We have therefore based khadi on truth and non-violence. If we forget it and think of producing khadi anyhow, a time will come when we shall be burning khadi. No other constructive activity is so much ridiculed and denounced as khadi. The coming of the mills has given people all the more occasion to do so. In their own way they are justified. Since khadi was there in the past, they ask, why did we become slaves. How can we treat the same khadi as a means to our freedom? It is the duty of the Sangh to answer them. This is the question Jajuji has placed before us.
 We have to produce khadi on a large scale. We also have to think how. But if we forget truth and non-violence, no matter how much khadi we may produce, we shall lose it in the end. If we do not hold on to the basic thing, impurities will creep in. Khadi workers should therefore see that the whole khadi business is kept pure. Today when we contemplate producing khadi on a mass scale we ought not to forget the basic thing. Today I shall not say that all our spinners too should understand truth and non-violence. But I must say this about our 3,000 workers. If they do not abide by truth and non- violence we shall sink. Shri Bharatanandaji has  formulated  a graduated plan to provide for meeting the demand of khadi for the whole of India at the end of ten years. Today the plan is a mere set of figures on paper. But it can be turned into reality. How is it possible, however, if we do not find good workers? If we but make up our minds we can become really good workers. Jajuji is right in giving this matter the first place. The question before us is: ‘How can we produce such workers?’ If we are always awake we shall develop the spirit of non-violence and self-sacrifice. Even a votary of violence is capable of self-sacrifice. Hitler too is said to be self-sacrificing. He is violence incarnate. It is said he is a vegetarian. I find it difficult to imagine
 how, if he is one, he is able to countenance so much slaughter. Anyway, his is said to be a life of self-sacrifice. He has no vices. He has not married. His character is said to be clean. He is always alert. What we require is both self-sacrifice and non-violence. Non-violence means love. First the chief workers should manifest it. We may begin with myself, then Jajuji and then the members of the Council. Let us be vigilant and alert. Our example is bound to influence the workers, even if unconsciously. Then we shall be able to make ourselves free of doubts and fears about khadi. It does not matter if our speed is slow. We must never renounce the principles we have evolved. If we do not forsake them, we are bound to be successful.libtech_599_footnote
 The question of a living wage is a difficult one.libtech_600_footnotelibtech_601_footnoteI myself have not been able to form any opinion on it. If I come across a man who is good and qualified I should be tempted. I shouldn’t want to lose him. If we frame a certain rule then we must follow that rule. I have been trying to frame some rule. But we must confess that at the moment we are helpless. We cannot frame a rule which will make it difficult for us to find workers. To make such a rule would mean that we do not move with the times. We shall thereby even lose the ability to pay a wage of three annas to each spinner. It is true and just that if we pay spinners three annas we should ourselves learn to live on three annas. Today we are taking many times more than what the spinners get. Even the lowest paid worker amongst us receives many times more. But I must confess with shame that this disparity has put us in difficulties. However, I have no satisfactory solution.

  December 19, 1941 As the 	war approaches the Indian border, people begin to get scared. I  	have a  typical letter from Assam and others from  various parts. 	They expect guidance from me as a war-resister and director of satyagraha.  	So far as satyagraha is concerned, in areas such as Assam 	responsible Congressmen should not offer satyagraha but should 	devote themselves to steadying those who are under Congress 	influence.  	As to the guidance of those who would listen to the Congress or me, 	the people will presently have directions from the Working 	Committee.  	But so far as I am concerned, I am quite clear that the people 	should refuse to be scared even though bombs may be dropped in their 	midst. For the time being at any rate the danger is to be expected 	only in the big cities. Those who do not wish to run any risk would 	do well quietly to leave their cities.  	It is wrong to make a rush on every scare and crowd the railway 	stations. The railway staff cannot possibly cope with sudden rushes. 	It is unmanly to rush for saving oneself. A wise and brave man will 	wait till the last man is safely out. What I have said applies to 	all Con- gressmen and others. I would not like it to be said of us 	as a nation that we run about like mad men on the approach of the 	slightest danger. We must face bravely any situation that may befall 	us.  	Congressmen who are war-resisters will remain at their posts and 	offer such assistance to the people as is within their power. They 	will run, at any risk, to the help of those who may be injured.  	Whilst I have been and am still against Congressmen joining A.R.P., 	I have never thought or suggested that Congressmen should leave 	points of danger or fields of service. 
 It is not necessary to belong to any Government organization to be able to render effective service without expectation of reward or praise.
 The chief thing is to preserve complete equanimity, no matter what danger faces us. This is especially so for those who are warresisters and fear no enemy.

 BARDOLI,
  December 	20, 1941  	I have been asked for a brief statement on the entry of America in 	the war. It is not possible for me to join the chorus of current 	opinion. I cannot welcome this entry of America. American tradition 	singles her out as an arbitrator and mediator between the warring 	nations. By her territorial vastness, amazing energy, unrivalled 	finan- cial status and owing to the composite character of her 	people she is the one country which could have saved the world from  	the unthinkable butchery that is going on.  	I do not know whether America could have avoided the entry. I have 	no data for giving a decisive opinion on the question. I have only 	expressed my fervent wish that it might have been possible for her 	to play her natural part. It is tragic to contemplate that with 	America as party to the war there is no great Power left which can 	mediate and bring about peace for which I have no doubt the peoples 	of all lands are thirsting. It is a strange phenomenon that the 	human wish is paralysed by the creeping effect of the war fever.  The 	Bombay Chronicle, 	21-12-1941

    STATEMENT TO THE PRESS      BARDOLI, 
  December 	27, 1941  	The action of the Bihar Government in banning the meeting of the 	Hindu Mahasabha has always appeared to me to be inexplicable.libtech_610_footnoteThose who had proclaimed their desire to hold the 	meeting were responsible men and, what is more, so far as I am 	aware, trusted by the Central Government and known to be 	pro-Government. They had and have identified themselves with the war 	effort. Why such people could not be trusted by the Bihar Provincial 	Government to behave decently passes my comprehension. I see that 	Vir Savarkarlibtech_611_footnotehad 	accommodated the Bihar authorities to the extent of postponing the 	session with a view to coming to an understanding.  	When all attempts at a settlement failed, civil resistance was the 	only remedy open to the suppressed Hindu Mahasabha. And I must 	confess it fills me with delight to find Vir Savarkar, Dr. Moonje 	and other leaders being arrestedlibtech_612_footnotein their attempt to assert the very primary and very 	fundamental right of holding an orderly meeting subject to all 	reasonable restrictions about the preservation of the public peace. 	I observe that even Dr. Shyama  	Prasad, the new Finance Minister of the Bengal Government, has 	successfully courted arrest by committing the same  honourable 	offence that his colleagues have committed. I congratulate the 	leaders of the Sabha on their dignified and peaceful protest against 	the utterly arbitrary action of the Bihar Government. There is 	surely something     A.I.C.C. 	meeting at Wardha.    
 terribly wrong in it. But out of evil somehow or other good often results. Let me hope that this action of the Bihar Government has brought the Hindus and Muslims of Bihar, and even all India, together on the common platform of human liberty. For I am quite sure that the Muslim League could not possibly wish the denial to their sister organization of a liberty which they could claim for themselves. I hope that there will be only one end to this Bihar episode, viz., lifting of the ban on the Hindu Mahasabha and the men who are imprisoned today holding their session without let or hindrance.

   DISCUSSION AT WORKING COMMITTEE MEETINGlibtech_621_footnote  
 [On or before December 30, 1940]libtech_622_footnoteSo far as I am concerned, even if I was given the utmost power conceivable, even if I was made the Viceroy of India today, would I
ask the people of India to take up the sword to keep the Empire alive?
 I for one should feel that I was committing moral suicide in that I would be abandoning the faith of a lifetime, the faith which I had persuaded the Congress to accept for twenty years as a policy. The steady unflinching pursuit of that policy has brought us quite close to the achievement of the objective. Am I to abandon the very boat which has brought me quite close to the shore? Yudhishthiralibtech_623_footnotelibtech_624_footnotewould not forsake his faithful dog and enter the gates of Heaven without him. For he knew that the Kingdom of Heaven would be as naught to him without the dog, i.e., his faith. Would the Arab (i.e., the Congress) give up towards the end of the journey the faithful steed (i.e., non- violence) that had made it possible for [him]libtech_625_footnotelibtech_626_footnoteto make that journey? It would be an act of betrayal or faithlessness on my part. Could I, when the war is at my door and when I am in the same predicament as they, forget the sovereign remedy I suggested to themlibtech_627_footnotelibtech_628_footnoteand clutch at the
 
 method I have denounced and discarded? No matter what the country would say, what should be the attitude of individual Congressmen who had sworn by the method of non-violence?
 He was clear that, if it was felt that we had committed a mistake, that it was worth while bargaining a principle for what seemed to be a richer gain, they should declare their conviction, and if and when the objective was gained, they should convert the whole of India into a recruiting ground, ask every man and woman to contribute his or her share in the war effort, and even extinguish themselves in so doing. What was needed was downright honesty. He at any rate had never conceived this possibility. If he knew that some day India would have to engage in a violent war in order to win independence, he would long ago have addressed every youth to go in for military discipline, and he would not have placed tireless emphasis, day in and day out, on the various items of the constructive programme.

    LETTER TO ABUL KALAM AZAD        BARDOLI, 
    DEAR 	MAULANA SAHIB,  December 	30, 1941 
  	In the course of discussion in the Working Committee, I discov- ered 	that I had committed a grave error in the interpretation of the 	Bombay Resolution. I had interpreted it to mean that the Congress 	was to refuse participation in the present or all wars on the ground 	principally of non-violence. I found to my astonishment that most 	members differed from my interpretation and held that the opposition 	need not be on the ground of  non-violence.  On  rereading  the 	Bombay Resolution I found that the differing members were right and 	that I had read into it a meaning which its letter could not bear. 	The discovery of the error makes it impossible for me to lead the 	Congress in the struggle for resistance to war effort on grounds in 	which non- violence was not indispensable. I could not, for 	instance, identify myself with opposition to war effort on the 	ground of ill will against Great Britain. The resolution 	contemplated material association with Britain in the war effort as 	a price for guaranteed independence of India. If such was my view, 	and I believed in the use of violence for gaining independence and 	yet refused participation in the effort as the price of that 	independence, I would consider myself guilty of unpatriotic conduct. 	It is my certain belief that only non-violence can save India and 	the world from self-extinction. Such being the case, I must continue 	my mission whether I am alone or assisted by an organization or 	individuals. You will, therefore, please relieve me of the 	responsibility laid upon me by the Bombay Resolution. I must 
 continue civil disobedience for free speech against all war with such Congressmen and others whom I select and who believe in the non- violence I have contemplated and are willing to conform to prescribed conditions.
 I will not, at this critical period, select for civil disobedience those whose services are required to steady and help the people in their respective localities.libtech_629_footnote

    STATEMENT TO THE PRESS       BARDOLI, 
  December 30, 1941 If 	anyone had thought, as I had thought, that the door to Congress 	participation in the present war on the ground of Congress non-violence 	was closed for ever by the Bombay Resolution, then they  	may now know that the Bombay Resolution had not quite closed the 	door. Undoubtedly, as the resolution said, the Poona resolution had 	lapsed, therefore, the Poona offer had lapsed. But the Congress has 	now, through the Working Committee, made it clear that the door is 	not barred altogether against Congress participation, certainly not 	on the ground of non-violence.  	The key for unlocking the door remains  principally in  the hands of 	the British Government. The Working Committtee has very properly 	declined to state the terms on which that  door  can  be opened. It 	will depend upon varying circumstances, but, in my  opinion, the 	chief circumstance is the Government. Having been insulted often 	enough, the Working Committee would not court any further insult by 	making any offer. After all, its position is absolutely clear. 	Everbody knows what the Congress stands for and what it wants. 	Everyone should, therefore, know that nothing will be accepted by 	the Congress short of what it stands for. Therefore, the burden of 	the next step is cast on the Government. This is the chief thing 	that is relevant at the present time.  	I have a pressing cable from those English friends who are 	interested in India’s freedom and who are lovers of their own 	people.     Appendix 	“Congres Working Committee’s Resolution”, 30-12-1941. 
 I have not replied to that cable. They have reminded me of Mr. Andrews’ legacy. Whatever the meaning of their reminder, my mean- ing could only be one. The one indissoluble bond between Charlie Andrews and myself was that we would never compromise our cons- cience on any account whatsoever. And, in all that I have done, I can fearlessly claim that I have been guided by my conscience.
 I have made it clear in my letterlibtech_630_footnoteto the Maulana Sahib that I could not possibly identify myself with the door to participation being kept open in any shape or form, because that would mean, in my opinion, a recantation of all that the Congress has stood for the last twenty years or more. I would not be guilty of selling that heritage even for the independence of India because it would not be real independence.
 I feel that if any country has a message for the world, which is groaning under violence unknown perhaps to history, it is  India.  When India, through the Indian National Congress, accepted  the  policy of non-violence, so far as I know, no Congressman had thought that another war—and such a bloody war—was to come so soon as it has. The testing time, however, has come for India and I, who have an unchangeable belief in the efficacy of non-violence for the present distemper from which mankind is suffering, could not possibly in any manner, directly or indirectly, associate myself with participation in the war; and so I have stood out.
 But the Congress contains men and women holding varying shades of opinion and, therefore, it should be no wonder that the Working Committee represents those varying shades of opinion. It has at least three bodies or, rather, it has at least three bodies representing three schools of thought: a minority party, believing in non-partici- pation on the ground of non-violence, pure and simple; the other believing that the Congress should not carry non-violence to the point of refusing association in the war under any circumstances and there is the third, which has many reasons almost as strong as the decisive reason of non-violence guiding the minority. The resolutionlibtech_631_footnotewhich has been just handed by the Secretary of the Working Committee to the Press is a resultant of the efforts of these bodies. I would like the public and Congressmen to read that resolution in that light. I hope everybody will appreciate the fact that the Working Committee has not come to any hasty decision. It did not mind what time it took in order
 
 to produce a resolution worthy of the great national organization that it represents.
 I would say one thing to Congressmen that those who are believers in non-violence in the same sense that I am, have nothing to fear, as I interpret the resolution of the Working Committee. It not only leaves them absolutely free to hold that opinion but to propagate it for the acceptance of anybody who chooses. Only they remain in the Congress so long as the Congress is not called upon to participate in the war effort. It is open to them to convert all Congressmen to their view. I am quite sure that the Working Committee will welcome such a conversion but I would warn Congressmen against indecision at this critical period in the national life and I would warn them also against weakly following this party or that for the sake of gaining power in the Congress. Those who do so will miserably fail to gain power for the nation. Personally, I would like the Congress, as I would like the whole world, to accept non-violence as the law of life in every department, social, political and domestic. But there is no room for cowardliness. I would far rather that we all became violent than cowards. Let me hope, therefore, that every Congressman will have his own convictions and the courage to enforce them.

   SPEECH AT GUJARAT PROVINCIAL CONGRESS COMMITTEE 		MEETING libtech_647_footnote  
 BARDOLI,
 January 4, 1942
 [Gandhiji] first asked everyone if he had understood all the implications of the Bardoli Resolution.libtech_648_footnote
 Then let me put it to you in a nutshell. The resolution means that, if the Government gave a guarantee that full freedom would be given after the war, the Congress would help in keeping this Empire alive. It was not that the bargain had been actually made, but the terms had been agreed upon, whereas, if I did not want to enter into any bargain at all, I should plainly say so. If you feel that on  your  agreeing to offer full co-operation in the war effort, India will have complete independence after the war, that the British will thereafter remain in India at your mercy and sufferance, that even during the war you will run your own affairs provided of course that your Defence Minister will carry on the war to victory, you must confirm the Bardoli Resolution. The temptation is very great indeed. If for that sake you are ready to reverse the Congress policy and purchase swaraj and pay as price thereof ahimsa, you must confirm the resolution. Remember that the very greatest of our leaders are party to the resolution and they have not chosen to do so lightly. As against this there are those who think that ahimsa is a pearl of great price and that it cannot be given up, that it can never be the price of swaraj, then their position is different. But if you are in doubt, if you feel that in sticking to ahimsa you lose both ahimsa, because you are incapable of it, and swaraj, that Gandhi is a good man but it would be prudent not to go the whole length with him, then you must accept the resolution. Only those will express their disapproval of it who are sure in their heart of hearts that prudence, political insight, policy, every conside- ration demands that ahimsa may not be sacrificed for swaraj. Now let those  who  will  vote  for  the  Bardoli  Resolution  raise  their  hands.libtech_649_footnote
 
 
 Appendix “Congress Woring Committee Resolution”, 30-12-1941.
 Good. Now let the acharyas (masters) of ahimsa raise their hands.libtech_650_footnote
 There were about ten neutrals who wanted to put questions, but Gandhiji said as the vote was quite informal the neutrals need not trouble themselves.libtech_651_footnote
 Mahatma Gandhi stated that he had not left the Congress, and his position was the same even at Bombay. He said :
I am a servant of the Congress and I want to serve the Congress
 in consonance with the principles of truth and non-violence. The Working Committee has decided to co-operate with the Government in war if Britain grants swaraj to India.
 Whatever be my opinion, you must exercise our free judgement in this matter.
 It is not a fact that the Congress has violated the principle of non-violence but it has only made a small opening for violence just with a view to shaking hands with Britain.
 Rajaji thinks that all of us should go to war fully armed, but it may not be the opinion of all.
 We should continue the constructive programme. Of course it will be now very much restricted. I do not want to send workers to jail nowadays when their services can be better availed of in alleviating panic.

   STATEMENT TO THE PRESSlibtech_653_footnote  
 BARDOLI,
 January 7, 1942
 As far as may be, I have been endeavouring to study the internal and  external  reaction  to  the   Working   Committee   resolution.libtech_654_footnoteMy being relieved of the direction of Congress civil disobedience does not reduce my responsibility but increases it manifold. For one thing, my official disconnection with the Congress itself increases my detach- ment; but since detachment never means indifference, my attachment to every Congressman increases and I must speak to him more than before. The voice of silence was enough to direct the campaign of civil disobedience, but it is not enough to explain and interpret in terms of non-violence the day-to-day puzzles that arise in the minds of Congressmen and others by reason of the overwhelming events happening near us.
 Rangoon was naturally and culturally part of us before Burma years ago became part of British India and, therefore, it remains part of us though now sundered. What has happened there,libtech_655_footnotehas had its repercussions all over India.
 So far as I can see, civil disobedience in the sense in which it was launched is not likely to be revived on behalf of the Congress till the war has ended. In a purely symbolic manner it may have to be kept up not in the name of the Congress but on behalf of resisters of all war on the pure ground of non-violence, no matter how few they are. It will be kept up for the sake of asserting the right of resisters to carry on propaganda against all war. They dare not keep still in the midst of
 
 the unhuman slaughter that is going on. They must not only speak and write against it, they must, if need be, sacrifice themselves in the attempt to stop the torrent of blood. Whether they are a few or many they have to live their mission.
 Before taking any step in the direction of civil disobedience I propose to restart the three weeklieslibtech_656_footnoteand understand the reaction of Government to the new orientation. I hope that they will have no objection to propaganda, naturally non-violent, against all war.  It would be non-embarrassing in the sense that there cannot be, as there never was, any idea of surrounding or picketing munition factories or recruiting offices.
 If the right is not conceded, there must be token civil disobe- dience by the fewest possible, even one or two known believers in resistance to all war. I must not select many, because every worker is wanted to educate the people in the art of non-violent behaviour in the face of impending danger.
 Strange as it may appear, I suggest that ceaseless occupation in constructive programme is the best preparation to face danger. For it means concentration in villages of the city people and their being occupied and occupying the villagers in productive and educative work.
 This removes unemployment and with it fear. Such movement on a large scale at once inaugurates a new social order. It will cons- titute the greatest contribution to internal peace, and should render nugatory formidable panicky ordinances just issued.

    SPEECH AT KHADI VIDYALAYAlibtech_658_footnote      BARDOLI, 
  January 8, 1942 Needless to say that it gives me 	pleasure to declare this Khadi Vidyalaya open. There should be many 	such vidyalayas in Gujarat. As 	a matter of fact Khadi Vidyalaya may be said to have been opened  	when in 1921 we decided to prepare for launching satyagraha. I had 	not then discovered  the  word  vidyalayalibtech_659_footnotelibtech_660_footnoteand 	 had  at  any  rate  not associated it with khadi, though I knew 	that khadi was a vidya (science), and most important of 	sciences. But I had then not the courage to say it. But the 	beginning was made here, anything that was invented in the line took 	the name of Bardoli—as for instance, the ‘Bardoli pinjan’ 	(carding-bow.) Then we had a big depot here for the manufacture of 	all our implements. This depot has,  for  several reasons, been 	moved to Sabarmati. Whilst, therefore, it is a pleasure to me to 	open the Vidyalaya, it is a matter of sorrow that we should be 	opening it at this late day.  	It needs no argument today to prove that the charkha is linked with 	ahimsa and therefore with swaraj. What is going to be the part that 	crores of our people will play during the deadly carnage that is 	going on? We know the part that Government are playing, we know the 	part that some of us are playing at their behest, and to satisfy the 	pangs of hunger and starvation. They are rushing headlong to take 	part in the work of destruction. Millions are being collected from 	the rich and the poor, and yet the Government coffers are ever 	empty. But barring those that are thus directly and indirectly 	helping in the work of destruction, what are the rest going to do, 	what can they do? How are they to carry on? There is 	starvation and poverty everywhere. There is scarcity of water, and 	unlike in South Africa where there is     
 every provision against droughts, there is none here, and we and our cattle die like flies for want of water. Those that go to war do so in the hope of returning alive after killing others, some may not return at all. But shall we be content to die like flies? We have sworn by ahimsa and pledged ourselves to win swaraj by ahimsa. It is twenty years since we took the pledge, yet we do not know how to redeem it. What then is the thing that will enable us to work for swaraj, and to stand erect and strong in the face of this conflagration? It is the charkha and all it means. Land we have, but the land system, uneconomic holdings and methods, have reduced us to the level of beasts of burden, it does not yield us enough to eat all the year round, and we are workless for almost half the year. We have, therefore, to take up subsidiary indus- tries. Those are the charkha and the allied activities.
 I do not want to repeat the argument or go into the implications of the science of khadi. It is a good thing that this vidyalaya is being opened. Let this Vidyalaya generate a force that may universalize the charkha in Gujarat. There are, I am told, seventy thousand Congress members in Ahmedabad. If all these were regular spinners, did they give their quota of yarn to the Congress? Congress soldiers should not forget that their chief weapon is the charkha and spinning regularly is their ‘military’ discipline. The military weapons and munitions today have proved futile. They have failed to keep Czechoslovakia, Poland and France free or alive, though they boasted of renowned soldiers. Hitler has enslaved them all. Besides, we can no more guarantee the welfare of a country that engages in armed warfare. President Roose- velt says he and the Allied Powers are fighting the Axis Powers to make the nations of the world free, and that the Axis Powers are fighting to enslave the world. But to me both the parties seem to be tarred with the same brush.
 What shall we do in the midst of this mutual destruction which spells freedom for none? The charkha and all it means is the only thing that will enable us to live and make us stand in honour and self- respect . This we can do if we can combine faith with understanding, for un-understanding faith will not carry us far. The work has been placed into Uttamchand’s hands. The responsibility has been entrus- ted to him, not because he is an expert, but because he has the faith. If he refuses other responsibilities and concentrates on this task, he is sure to bring credit to this venture, difficult as it is.
Don’t think that you have come here just to learn the art of
 khadi. If you labour under such a misunderstanding you will not be
 able to turn out any work anywhere. You have come here to bear the burden of the work for swaraj. It is a tremendous burden to bear, and the very first lesson you have to learn is to know the qualifications of the soldiers of swaraj. The very first is restraint and patient labour. That is what the charkha will teach you. The renowned cities of the world are crumbling into dust. London is changed out of recognition, the edifices which the builders thought would stand the revages of time are no more. St. Paul’s Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, Buckin- gham Palace have all been bombed with the result that what is called the capital of the world today looks, to use Narmadashankar’s word, “devastated”. And our cities like Rangoon will share the same fate. The age of cities is thus coming to an end. The slogan of ‘Back to the villages’ was never so true as today. Therefore all of you at any rate have to go to the villages. The mills will not be of any avail. They are producing cloth for the belligerents and may ere long cease even to do that work, and may have solely to engage in producing munition. We have therefore to produce all our cloth and to make our villages self-sufficient in all respects. That you cannot do without a life of restraint and patient toil. For this you will have to know all  the processes right from identifying the different varieties of cotton to the stage when it becomes fit to be woven into khadi. The course you have to prepare for is not simple. It will require all your energies and your faculties, for it is an all-comprehensive one. What about girls? Girls also may be admitted, but that depends upon Uttamchand’s courage. We cannot admit them right now. Every one of us, man or woman, has to lend his hands and his mind and his heart to the work of building our nation and swaraj.

    DISCUSSION WITH HARIJAN WORKERS libtech_661_footnote      BARDOLI, 
  January 8, 1942libtech_662_footnote  The 	first was the question about the wells: Should we seek the 	co-operation of Harijans, and, if so, to what extent? Co-operation 	is necessary, but we must not take the Harijans in a body 	 and  invade   the   savarna  quarters.  We  should  visit  	the  wells,     
 ascertain the classes of people using them, and reason with these to let the Harijans use them. Regarding Local Board wells the help of offi- cials may be freely sought, and such Harijans may be asked to go and use the wells as may be prepared to stand ill-treatment. But the brunt should be borne by the sevakslibtech_663_footnote, care being taken to stand between the Harijans and those who would threaten to molest or belabour them. The Harijans should be invariably asked to use clean vessels and observe all the ordinary rules of cleanliness. We can also dig wells for Harijans and invite the savarnas to use them. It is likely that the Harijans may be boycotted, we should see that they get employment elsewhere. The Harijans have to be taught to learn to assert themselves firmly and non-violently, and the savarnas may be gently reminded that injustice cannot last for ever. These are broad principles, but everyone has to take measures suited to the circumstances in each case.
 Q.	Can’t we insist on the admission of Harijan boys to hostels where all
 non-Harijan Hindu boys are admitted?
 A. Of course, but care should be taken to see that the hostel is not exclusively for a particular community or section of Hindus.  Where all sections are admitted and only the Harijans are excluded, the workers should strain every nerve to get the Harijans admitted.
 When I said that removal of untouchability did not include the removal of restrictions on inter-dining and intermarriage, I had the general Hindu public in mind, not the Congress workers or Congress- men. These have to abolish untouchability from every part of their life.
 The next question was about the temptations given by missionaries in the shape of books, school fees, etc., with a view to the boys’ ultimate conversion. How was one to deal with them?
 [A.] The missionaries have of course the right to preach the gospel of Christ and to invite non-Christians to embrace Christianity. But every attempt to press material benefits or attractions in the aid of conversion should be freely exposed, and the Harijans should be edu- cated to resist these temptations.
 Q. What are the qualifications that a Harijan sevak should have in order to make his work felt?
A.	Such a  question is rather late in the day. But I  shall try  to
 answer it again. It is a misfortune that politics have been mixed up with   anti-untouchability   work,   which   is   essentially   one   of  self-
 
 purification, justice, humanity. Long before I took to politics I felt that abolition of untouchability and Hindu-Muslim unity were essential for national well-being. In order to prevent the vivisection of Hinduism I had to fight it with my life, and the question did receive a political complexion, but in essence it is a purely religious and moral question. Every sevak must be fired with a passion  to  purify Hinduism, and must be ready to lay down his life in the attempt. Such  a sevak will be ready to sacrifice his all—family connections, social advantages, and life itself—in order to wipe out the blot on Hinduism. The work should be as one of life’s essential functions, e.g., offering one’s prayers, ablutions, etc., not carrying emolument or reward. If the worker is fired with this passion, the way will be clear before him. Thus a worker would rather starve than allow the Harijans to  be  starved, would hesitate to use amenities which are denied to  the Harijans and feel increasing identification with them every day. All this work is to be done without regard to the political results. Assum- ing for a moment that swaraj does not come as a result of the abolition of untouchability, the work has to be done in order to keep Hinduism pure and alive. I know that with some of the Congressmen the work has only a political meaning, but it is wrong. If they seek justice from an alien Government, they must first do justice to their own kith and kin. That is the fundamental maxim of equity—he who seeks equity must do equity.
 There is, I know, a section who says that political freedom must be won first and social reform would follow later. It is a wrong idea, and certainly inconsistent with one who would win swaraj by non- violent means. But the Harijan worker has to educate both the ortho- dox and exclusively political-minded people. Let him not judge others, but by selfless self-effacing service set an example to them.

   ADVICE TO KHADI WORKERS libtech_664_footnote  
 BARDOLI,
 [On or before January 9, 1942]libtech_665_footnote[Q.]	We are producing two lakhs of rupees worth of khadi, but the demand exceeds 12 lakhs. How are we to meet it? We have not enough weavers and workers,
 and there is the question of funds too.
 [A.]	Let me take up the last question first. It is my firm conviction which has grown upon me with the years that, if there are
 
 workers, no work suffers for want of funds. But the real question is of the capacity to produce. Supposing someone gave you one crore of rupees, I know you cannot produce ten crore rupees worth of khadi. The reason is lack of workers, lack of efficiency, and lack of faith. It is good that there is a growing demand for khadi—though twelve lakhs of rupees worth of khadi is nothing extraordinary where eight crores of rupees worth of khadi could be used. But the increased sales mean that the liking for khadi is also on the increase. We should contact these consumers and persuade them to spin. And here comes in the dhanush takli. You may know that I can spin on the ordinary wheel better, but I have made a point of using only the dhanush takli, and I am now almost an expert in it. The reason is that, whereas Lakshmidasbhailibtech_666_footnotelibtech_667_footnotecannot execute an order for 25 lakhs of wheels, the people can themselves make as many dhanush taklis. It is so easy to make, so cheap, takes very little material and practically no technical skill. It is a wrong policy to manufacture wheels in Sabarmati in order to export them to the Punjab or South India. They should be made locally everywhere, and for that purpose the dhanush takli  is  the thing. Universalization of this will increase production by leaps and bounds.
 You have to catch the increasing love of spinning by the fore- lock. In none of our previous campaigns was spinning done on such a large scale as during the last campaign. The figures for Sabarmati Jail were good, but the figures for Agra and Bareilly were also good. Badshah Khan has been able to popularize spinning as he had never been before. We have, therefore, to take this tide at the flood and bring expert knowledge to bear on the love for spinning that is grow- ing.
 We have to go from house to house and enlist willing spinners ready to contribute their yarn.
 I take it that all khadi workers are believers in the attainment of swaraj by non-violent means. Yours then should be the largest contribution to constructive work.
 Some of you have to be weavers too. There are enough handloom weavers in India to produce all the cloth we need. We have to persuade them to take to weaving hand-spun yarn and also to get their womenfolk and children to produce yarn in their homes.

   NOTES  
 TO THE S UBSCRIBERS
 The Manager tells me that the subscribers of Harijan have appreciated the unavoidable suspension and exercised extraordinary patience. With a few understandable exceptions they have not recalled the balance of the unused subscription due to them. I am glad to be able now to say that they will have their copy again regularly. It will not be possible to retain the old rate for reasons they know. The subscriptions left over will be credited to the subscribers who will be notified when they are to be exhausted. I hope that the three editions will retain their old popularity. I expect even visible increase, for I believe in the intrinsic value of the menu that will be served to the reader from week to week. The three weeklies are purely and simply media of service. Never have they been a business enterprise.
 “VIOLENCE IS DISASTROUS”
 Shri S. V. Thakar, the quiet but efficient worker in the Harijan and other causes, sends me a note drawing attention to a violent feud between two parties of Bhils which his intervention with Government assistance has just prevented. The late Gula Maharaj, himself a Bhil reformer, had by his earnestness and simplicity appealed to the Bhil imagination, and thousands of them inspired by him had abandoned drink and other evil habits. He died a year ago leaving a successor. There was a social boycott proclaimed by the reform party against those who would not give up bad habits. This bred bad blood.  Violence seemed imminent. Shri Thakar’s  timely intervention referred to above stopped bloodshed. But the reform has suffered a setback. The party of opposition is in the ascendant, and unless the pure ethical spirit again pervades the movement it may collapse. Shri Thakar rightly wishes to draw the moral that violence even in a good cause will not answer, and that every reform must be broadbased on the willing and enlightened association of the people concerned. They cannot be coerced into good habits.
 ADIVASIS
 Thakkar Bapa complains that, whilst he likes the pamphlet dealing with the constructive programme, he misses in it mention of Adivasis or the so-called aboriginals, such as Santhals, Bhils, etc.libtech_668_footnoteThe
 
 complaint is just. Many other causes are included in the constructive programme by implication. But that cannot and should not satisfy such a humanitarian as Thakkar Bapa. The Adivasis are the original inhabitants whose material position is perhaps no better than that of Harijans and who have long been victims of neglect on the part of the so-called high classes. The Adivasis should have found a special place in the constructive programme. Non-mention was an oversight. They provide a vast field of service for Congressmen. The Christian missio- nary has been more or less in sole occupation of the field. Great as his labour has been, it has not prospered as it might have, because of his ultimate aim being
 the Adivasis’ conversion to his fold and their becoming de- Indianized. Anyway, no one who hopes to construct swaraj on the foundation of non-violence can afford to neglect even the least of India’s sons. Adivasis are too numerous to be counted among the least.

   PEACE ORGANIZATION  
 If the Congress were an organization with a military bias, there is no doubt that today it would be a full-fledged military unit every member becoming trained to be an efficient soldier. Fortunately for India and humanity, the Congress is not such an organization. No other purely national organization is or can be in the India of today. Fortunately again for India and humanity, the Congress has pledged itself since 1920 to win India’s freedom through non-violent means. But up to now it has been largely a debating society, offering civil disobedience at intervals and all the time only playing with its vital programme of construction. At one time every Congressman was expected to create something for the nation. He or she was to spin for the nation. Congressmen would not respond, and the clause about spinning was dropped. There were other items too which every Congressman was to work. But he has not done so to the extent expected. The moment has now come for him to make a definite choice. The only programme before him is to become a servant or soldier of peace. A soldier of peace, unlike the one of the sword, has to give all his spare time to the promotion of peace alike in war time as in peace time. His work in peace time is both a measure  of prevention of, as also that of preparation for, war time.
 If then I was a Congressman with a vote, I would vote, as an emergency measure, for requiring every Congressman now on the
 Congress register or to come hereafter to possess the minimum qualifications for working the constructive programme. It would be wrong to remind me that the Congress should retain its democratic character. It will not lose it because, of its own motion, it becomes an efficient working body which anybody undertaking to obey its discipline and conditions of membership may join. The Congress will cease to be popular, if it cannot deserve popularity in times of stress. If it cannot provide work for the workless and hungry, if it cannot protect the people from depredations or teach them how to face them, if it cannot help them in the face of danger, it will lose its prestige and popularity. No person or corporation can live long on his  or  its capital. The latter has to circulate and multiply itself.
 The Congress has become popular because it has been foremost in fighting imperialism. Today the old way is of no avail. Nobody thinks of mass revolt at the present moment. The best, quickest and most efficient way is to build up from the bottom. The psychological moment has come. ‘Back to the villages!’ has become a necessity from every point of view. Now is the time to decentralize production and distribution. Every village has to become a self-sufficient repu- blic. This does not require brave resolutions. It requires brave, corporate, intelligent work. As far as I know at the present moment this is common ground between the rulers and the people.
 Let every Congressman answer for himself whether he will be a soldier or servant of peace or whether he will become a non-entity unwilling to take his place in building up swaraj.

   WHY?  
 While I was engaged in organizing and conducting the civil disobedience movement on behalf of the Congress I could not issue the three weeklies without noticing the doings of civil resisters and the general progress of the movement. That would have been to turn the weeklies into civil disobedience organs and to challenge the Govern- ment to suppress them. The Government in their turn could not but have accepted the challenge and suppressed the papers and even prosecuted me. Whilst I must always be ready to welcome imprison- ment, I was not then ready to court it. Nor was it my plan to invite suppression when my avowed object was to organize strictly and only individual civil disobedience. Therefore, even at the price of sacrifi- cing the pleasure of serving the people in various ways through the
 
 weeklies, duty demanded their stoppage. I feel that the step taken was correct in every way.
 The reason for suspension now no longer exists.  On  the  contrary I should fail in my duty, if I did not resume publication. As I have repeatedly said I am no enemy of Britain. I have many dear and personal friends among Britishers. I cannot wish ill to Britain. My resistance to war does not carry me to the point of thwarting those who wish to take part in it. I reason with them. I put before them the better way and leave them to make the choice.
 But we have arrived at a stage where it is no longer merely a question of resisting war effort. There are questions which confront war-resisters as much as they confront war-mongers. And they can be decided only one way by both, though the approach must vary. Such are questions of dealing with scarcity of food and clothing, looting and bread riots, etc. I have views on all these and like questions. Resumption of the weeklies is needed for the dissemination of my views on these and like matters. In the ability of the people to deal with them without fuss and even without Government effort lies the way to swaraj whose basis is non-violence. Mere Government effort cannot deal with crises affecting millions of people unless there is voluntary response from them.
 If we wish to achieve swaraj through truth and non-violence, gradual but steady building up from the bottom upwards by construc- tive effort is the only way. This rules out the deliberate creation of an anarchical state for the overthrow of the established order in the hope of throwing up from within a dictator who would rule with a rod of iron and produce order out of disorder.
 These columns will then deal with the day-to-day problems that face the people.

 [On or after January 10, 1942]libtech_670_footnote
 I knew the Sardar’s power of organization, but I discovered for the first time that the Sardar was a skilled agriculturist. Every inch of space in the banana garden and every drop of water that was being given to it had been made careful use of. The banana yielded a yearly
 
 crop, but in between the plants at convenient distances were fruit trees like the mango and the lichi and the chiku and grape fruit, and on the ridges were various vegetables. Surrounding the garden had been planted permanent trees, and inside the garden were walks making it easy for the field-worker to take care of the trees and also providing enough space with velvety earth for those who desired to have their morning and evening constitutional. All this was enough to rest and please the eyes and the mind. The Sardar’s labour had yielded the Ashram several thousand rupees and set an example to others. As a result dozens of people had taken to banana-growing.

   HAND-SPUN AS MEASURE OF VALUElibtech_674_footnote  
 In my part of India shells and seedless dried almonds were used as coins accepted by the people and the State treasury. They had no intrinsic value. They were a measure of people’s deep poverty. They could not afford the lowest metal coin. Five shells would buy them a little vegetable or a needle. I have suggested a measure which will not be a mere token but which will have always an intrinsic value which will also be its market value. In that sense it will be an ideal measure. For the present and by way of experiment I have suggested a warp length of a single thread of yarn as the lowest measure and to be used in dealings principally with the spinners and generally with khadi- lovers. The spinners can have all their daily wants supplied as against a fixed quantity of yarn. Stores will need to be maintained by the A. I.
 S. A. in combination with the A. I. V. I. A. and ultimately with those who will give their co-operation. As I conceive it, the system can be worked only if it is decentralized. This is not its demerit but merit. The end to be sought is human happiness combined with full mental and moral development. I use the adjective moral as synonymous with spiritual. This end can be achieved under decentralization. Centrali- zation as a system is inconsistent with non-violent structure of society.  I have presented to khadi workers and those who are interested in the solution of the problem of India’s poverty, the idea of a measure of value in its barest outline. Let them work it out and find for them- selves flaws, if any, in the conception, and if they do not, let them enforce it where they can.

 I have felled hundreds of palm-trees with my own hands, and got them felled before my eyes. I cannot bring those trees back. According to your argument any tree can be cut down. Of course, it is all right that you did what you deemed proper. I am pained that you cut down so many trees without consulting the others. The palm is a poor man’s tree. Do I have to explain to you its usefulness? If all the palm-trees are cut down, life at Sevagram will be severely affected. The palm-tree is interwoven with our life. Grass, etc., could have been sown in some other place. But you should not brood over it. It would be good if you take whatever lesson you can from it. I cannot spare any time. Speak to Gajananlibtech_675_footnote; explain this to others. Assess the utility of the palm-tree.

   SIR AKBAR HYDARIlibtech_676_footnote  
 The late Sir Akbar Hydarilibtech_677_footnotewas a rare combination. He was a great scholar, philosopher and reformer. He was a devout Muslim, but he saw nothing antagonistic to Islam in Hinduism. He was a student of various religions. He was catholic in the choice of his friends. On the return voyage from the second Round Table Conferencelibtech_678_footnotewe found ourselves in the same boat. He was a regular attendant at the evening prayers I used to have on board. He was so interested in the Gita verses and the bhajans we sang that he had got them all translated for him by Mahadev Desai. He had made me promise that we should tour together in India the interest of communal unity. But God had willed otherwise. The late Lord Willingdon had a different programme for me. I was plunged into the civil disobedience fight. Sir Akbar and I could never carry out the programme. He had come under the
 
 influence of Shri Aurobindo Ghose. He was almost invariably in Pondicherry during the days when the sage of Pondicherry gave the quarterly darshan to his devotees. Sir Akbar’s death is a great loss to the country. My respectful condolences to the deceased’s family.

    SPEECH AT A. I. C. C. MEETINGlibtech_683_footnote       WARDHA, 
  January 	15, 1942  	The President has put me in a quandary by raising me skyhigh, as if, 	one may think, I were a dweller in the clouds. That is not at all 	true. I have not yet used an aeroplane—of course, I have seen them 	flying in the skies, like birds but I have not touched one. So the 	question of flying does not arise. It is misuse of language to call 	such a man a dweller in the skies. I am of the earth, earthy. I am 	an ordi- nary mortal composed of common clay.  	The question of ahimsa would not have come up before you, had it not 	come up before the Working Committee at Bardoli. We discussed it for 	seven days. And it was well that it came up. The result has been 	good, not bad. But before I say anything on this question, let me 	make one or two things clear.  	Please note that I am, as I have said, an ordinary mortal like you. 	Had this not been the case, we should not have been able to work 	together these twenty years. Ahimsa with me is a creed, the breath 	of life. But it is never as a creed that I placed it before India 	or, for that matter, before anyone except in casual or informal 	talks. I placed it before the Congress as a political weapon, to be 	employed for the solution of political problems. It is a new 	experiment in ahimsa which  I have undertaken. As far as I am aware, 	no one has hitherto em- ployed ahimsa in the political arena in this 	manner. If someone has, at least I am not aware of it. Maybe it is a 	novel method, but it does not on that account lose its political 	character. I tried this for the first time in South Africa, with 	good results. I have brought it from there. The question there was 	exclusively of the political existence of Indians who had no 	political consciousness but had settled in South Africa as 	merchants, petty hawkers, etc. And there I used ahimsa as a 	political weapon. It was for them a question of life and death. The 	whites wanted them to quit. They had only two alternatives. They 	could either quit or stay there with the status of animals. We tried 	everything that was humanly possible. We found that all the 	so-called constitutional remedies, with which the Congress work in 	India had made me familiar, had failed. I was an expert in 	petition-writing which had yielded me lots of money. I have been for 	long a draftsman for    
 the Congress here, which work I used to do there also. They submitted many petitions, but when all other methods failed they resorted to satyagraha. The various measures that I adopted there were not the work of a visionary or a dreamer. They were the work of an essen- tially practical man dealing with practical political questions. As a political method, it can always be changed, modified, altered, even given up in preference to another. If, therefore, I say to you that our policy should not be given up today, I am talking political wisdom. It is political insight. It has served us in the past, it has enabled us to traverse many stages towards independence, and it is a politician that I tell you that it would be a grave mistake to think of giving it up. If I have carried the Congress with me all these years, it is in my capacity as a politician. It is hardly fair to describe my method as religious because it is new.
 Maulana Saheb has affectionately used high words of praise for me, but I cannot accept them. A thing can yet be discarded after showering all praise on it. A person can be raised sky-high and then cast down to the dust. I have been taunted as a Bania. It is all right. How can I help it? I was born a Bania. I shall stay a Bania and shall die as a Bania. Trade is my profession. I am trading with you and with the world. The article in my possession is an invaluable pearl. It has to be weighed in the proper scales—as Maulana Saheb rightly said, pearls, grass and men need different scales. I am a trader in ahimsa. Those who can pay the price for it may have it. In my view, it cannot be bartered away even for independence. But you do not value this thing as I do; because you do not have the scales with which to weigh it.
 Please do not think that I am speaking to you from a high pedestal. The simple question is why are we prepared today to discard a thing which we have cherished for so many years. No doubt, you have not discarded it yet, but you will if your terms are accepted. This much I am able to see. I do not raise the question of what we shall do after swaraj. I am myself not aware what I will do after swaraj. But today you are eager to barter away ahimsa for swaraj. You had taken a pledge that you would win swaraj only through ahimsa, and through no other means. Today you are ready to depart from it. I want to tell you that this bargain will not bring you complete independence. Independence for me means the independence of the humblest and poorest among us. Today we are at the threshold of independence on the strength of ahimsa. For the Congress to abandon ahimsa and to
 join warlibtech_684_footnoteis  to  undo  the  work  of  the  past  twenty  years.  It  is  my discomfiture that I could not make you see this.
This is not the time for counting votes.
 In spite of holding this view, I stand before you today to plead with you to accept this resolutionlibtech_685_footnote, and not even to divide the house. If I can convince you of this, you should accept my advice, otherwise leave it. This is not the time when we may canvass support for our groups and seek a vote. If we merely talk tall about independence but do nothing to attain it, how can we aspire for it? I had once said that everyone would become his own leader after my arrest. Today also you can become your own leaders and think for yourselves. But I want you to remember one thing. I am a man who won’t exchange ahimsa even for independence; and yet I am giving you this advice as an exponent of ahimsa.
 Along with this, I wish to reiterate that I do not wish to with-draw a single word from what I had written about the Poona Resolution and I have no regrets for what I said. However, the Bardoli Resolution, though it looks like the Poona Resolution, is a different thing. The Poona Resolution attempted to interpret ahimsa. The Bardoli Reso- lution does not do so. The Poona Resolution was the outcome of my mistake for which I have already atoned. But the Bardoli Resolution is the outcome of deliberations over many days. At one time after the Bardoli Resolution, I had thought of dividing the A. I. C. C. and testing how many members supported my view. But as the situation developed stage by stage, as I saw the climate in the country and the criticism of our Congress in the world, I came to the conclusion on the basis of my ahimsa that if I could persuade the A. I. C. C. I should advise them to accept this resolution deliberately and whole-heartedly. My advice to those who agree with me, that is, to those who have faith in total ahimsa, is to remain neutral and not vote for or against the resolution. But if their abstention helps the opponents of this  resolution to defeat it, they should vote in support of this resolution and not allow it to be defeated.
 I have no doubt that the Working Committee has taken a retro- grade step in passing this resolution. Rajaji may not agree, because he thinks I am in the wrong. Jawaharlal also may say that there is no retrograde step in this resolution. But in my opinion this step-back is a prelude to a step forward. A withdrawal sometimes  becomes necessary. We have a right to take a step back for jumping forward.
 
 
 Therefore a man who has parted company with you, who claims to be a satyagrahi and in whose life there is no room for tactical mani- pulations comes to you and advises you to accept this resolution, how- ever imperfect, because it correctly reflects the Congress mind. Even if the protagonists of ahimsa have a majority in this house, they should help the adoption of this resolution. The Congress does not know its own mind but I know that the attitude of the Congress is reflected in this resolution.
 The Congress has a great reputation. This resolution has enhan- ced it. The whole world is watching us, the eyes of our countrymen are fixed on us. Several people contemplated the prospect with trepidation, lest the Congress should flounder in response to Gandhi’s formula and become a religious organization instead of a political one. Let me dispel their fear, and say that  the  Congress  which accepted ahimsa as a creed can do no such thing, that we have not wasted the past twenty years. Whatever a doubting Thomas may think, when the moment of settlement arrives in Delhi, everyone will realize that the Congress remains the same with or without Gandhi. The language may differ, but the demand will remain the same. No one can cheat it. It will go on repeating ‘Neti, neti‘ libtech_686_footnoteuntil it wins the real substance it wants. If you can get what you want and you strike the bargain, you may be sure that I will not shed a single tear. If I am allowed to vent my views through my three weeklies, you will find me saying that I did become a trader but I could not sell my ahimsa.
 Whatever, therefore, our opponents inside and outside India may think and feel happy about, I won’t let them say that Gandhi was after all a crazy person. I do not want the Congress to look ridiculous in the eyes of the world. I do not want it to be said that in order to retain my leadership you bade good-bye to your senses because you had no courage to give give me up. I do not covet leadership by undermining anyone’s manhood. If the Congress alters its resolution for fear of losing my leadership and if I allow this transaction, this will result in the degradation of the Congress as well as my own. This is not the way  I work. It is a fraudulent way. Am I going to cheat the Congress after fifty years of national service?
 I have removed the very roots of this risk. I have told Maulana Saheb that you have not lost me by relieving me. You would lose me only if I cease to be loyal to the Congress, only if I become  a  visionary, only if I cease to be a practical man. It is not at Bardoli that
 
 I left the Congress; I did so seven years ago in Bombaylibtech_687_footnoteand I did so in order to be able to render greater service to the country and the Congress. If I am relinquishing the Congress now, I do so only to serve it better. Colleagues like the Sardar and Rajendra Babu are not happy over the resolution but I am asking them not to leave the Congress. If the real hour for leaving the Congress arrives, and if they continue to cling to their present convictions, then they may say good-bye to the Congress. But even if they leave the Congress, the Congress is not going to cease to function. Its work will go on whether they are there or not. No man, however great, is indispensable to the Congress. Those who built up the Congress like Dadabhai, Phero- zeshah and Lokamanya are no more, but the Congress still functions. For they have left for us an edifice to work upon and expand. Why should then my withdrawal or that of other leaders make any difference? The Congress will survive and will strike the bargain it is striving for.
 I wish to stop you from dividing the house by seeking a vote on this resolution. I do not want the Congress to look ridiculous in the eyes of the world. We have not a clean slate to write on. Our leaders have taken a step which has produced world-wide reactions. To alter the resolution out of shape is to ignore these. It would be unwise to change the policy adopted by the Working Committee. It will make the Congress appear ridiculous before the world. The world has a right to expect that the Working Committee’s policy will be endorsed by the A. I. C. C. We have no valid grounds to alter it. To those who want to catch up with me and introduce a new resolution for preser- ving ahimsa, I would say: ‘Yes, it does bring you credit. If you have chewed and digested ahimsa, I shall follow in your footsteps and so will Maulana Saheb. But I see no such evidence in you. If you bring another resolution merely to retain my leadership, it will be a foolish step. In fact, it will amount to violence. Therefore you should accept this resolution, however imperfect it may be.’
 Do not please go away with the idea that there is a rift in the Congress lute. As Maulana Saheb has said, the Working Committee has functioned like members of a happy family. Somebody suggested that Pandit Jawaharlal and I were estranged. This is baseless. Jawa- harlal has been resisting me ever since he fell into my net. You cannot divide water by repeatedly striking it with a stick. It is just as difficult to divide us. I have always said that not Rajaji, nor Sardar
 
 
 Vallabhbhailibtech_688_footnotelibtech_689_footnote, but Jawaharlal will be my successor. He says whatever is uppermost in his mind, but he always does what I want. When I am gone he will do what I am doing now. Then he will  speak  my language too. After all he was born in this land. Every day he learns some new thing. He fights with me because I am there. Whom will he fight when I am gone? And who will suffer his fighting? Ultimately, he will have to speak my language. Even if this does not happen, I would at least die with this faith.
 There is another reason why this resolution should  be supported. (By chance this resolution has) become a mirror of the Congress in which all groups can see themselves. I can see my own reflection, and so can Rajendra Babu, Badshah Khan, Sardar and the rest. Those who have spent a lifetime in cursing the Government as also those who wish to compromise with the Government can see their own reflections in this mirror.
 Maulana Saheb has not properly described how this resolution was framed. This is not the resolution as drafted by Jawaharlal. His draft has been materially amended. Rajaji also had a hand in revising it. People have an erroneous impression about Jawaharlal that he never budges from his views. Today at least he cannot get that certificate. He argues vehemently, but when the time for action arrives, he can make considerable compromises. This resolution is a product of a general consensus. The views of all the members of the Working Committee are reflected in this resolution. Like khichri it contains pulses, rice, salt, chilli and spices. Maulana Saheb has already explained the different points of view within the Working Committee. We have many groups amongst us. One is represented by Jawaharlal. His opposition to participation in the war effort is almost as strong as mine, though his reasons are different. He will not concede that he has retraced his steps in consenting to this resolution. But he himself will agree that the Rajaji group can take a different view of this resolution. The original draft had left no room for Rajaji and his followers to function. Rajaji would like to participate in the war effort if the Government accepted the conditions laid down by the Congress. So he has opened a tiny window for himself. Through this window Rajaji will try to pull Jawahar towards him and Jawahar will pull in the opposite direction. It is no longer open to the Government and the Congress critics to say that the Congress has banged the door against negotiation on the
 
 doctrinaire ground of non-violence. The resolution throws on the Government the entire burden of wooing the Congress by meeting its legitimate demands and securing its participation in the war effort. That nothing much is to be expected from the Government is  probably too true. Only the resolution puts the Congress right with the expectant world by debunking the criticism that the Congress is an organization of doctrinaires. And since there is a party in  the  Congress ready to welcome an honourable offer that will satisfy the rigidest test, it is as well that the resolution has accommodated this party. It has to be seen which group ultimately pulls the others. Whichever group wins, how can it harm us? We need have  no objection.
 Although different points of view have thus been accommo- dated in this resolution, it is not open to the charge of duplicity. It seeks to give an opportunity to different points of view to influence one another. This is how I understand it. Jawahar, Rajaji, Rajendra Babu as well as a man like me have each some elbow room in this resolution.
 How does this resolution leave scope for Rajendra Babu? We have contemplated some step for the future, which upsets him. But we are not here to decide what we shall do in the future. When India becomes free, the resolution says, we can defend ourselves with arms. If we wish to help China and Russia, the resolution leaves us free to do so. We have no ill will against the Britishers, and for that matter against Germans, Italians or Japanese. How then can we have an ill will against China and Russia? The Russianslibtech_690_footnotelibtech_691_footnotehave created a brave new thing. But I have my doubts as to how long they can defend their freedom in this manner. Experience tells us that any great work founded on force does not last. The Chinese sail in the same boat with us. It is a vast country and I am proud of it. I would like all these nations to be at peace with one another. If China seeks to defend herself with arms, she will have to become like Japan. She will have to do everything that Hitler and Mussolini are doing. I would like to think that when the occasion arises India would defend herself through non-violence and thus be a messenger of peace to the whole world. Jawahar will also then work for it—not for war. Rajendra Babu can therefore support this resolution. As a political [weapon] non-violence is no small thing; it can bring about all these results.
 
 
 You should all remember that non-violence is the  common factor among Jawaharlal, Rajaji, Rajendra Babu and Maulana Saheb. We are all agreed that today we have to work only through non- violence. We will think of other things at the appropriate time. That is why I find myself supporting this resolution.  Rajendra  Babu can today propagate to his heart’s content the message of ahimsa from the Congress platform. This resolution leaves him free to do so. Besides this, the instructions about the constructive programmelibtech_692_footnotelibtech_693_footnotefor Congress- men will promote ahimsa. It includes almost all the items of the thirteen-point constructive programme put forward by me. The U. P. Congress Committee has recently passed a resolution which is praiseworthy. It refers to ahimsa too. It covers everything that I should like it to.
 We have made a clean breast of everything in this resolution. When all of us are sailing in the same boat, why do you want to introduce a new resolution? Ahimsa is not a thing which can be established through mechanical means. Did I serve the Congress for the last twenty years on the strength of a ‘vote’? On the contrary, when matters reached the stage demanding a ‘vote’ I  voluntarily retired from the Congress. Voting is all right in small matters, but our work will be hampered if we decide larger issues by ‘vote’. The Congress is like a non-violent army. Our effort will be to keep it non- violent to the end. I am not going to restrain it if on the basis of experience we realize that we were on the wrong path.
 The real strength of the Congress lies in those people who are outside the Congress but rally to its support when the call goes out. They do not care for name or fame, nor have they any personal axe to grind. We have to become their true representatives. You have to forge the Congress into a strong, solid and disciplined organization.
 In the past 15 months Congressmen have evinced some sense of discipline. Occasionally there were lapses but I tolerated them because  I had to steer the Congress ship. But now we shall have to observe stricter discipline. The time has now arrived when the Congress should act with one mind. The ultimate weapon of the Congress today is ahimsa. Until this creed is altered, no Congressman can  preach violence openly or secretly. If he does so, he will be disloyal. No one can however judge what lies inside a man’s heart. But we will have to enlist all those who promise to march in step with us. This resolution keeps the door open for every honest Congressman.
 Finally, some friends ask, ‘What has the Congress done, after all?’ They complain that the resolution has no operative clause. The
 
 complaint is true so far as the resolution is concerned. The Congress will issue separate instructions for this purpose. The resolution had to be merely explanatory. It is addressed less to Congressmen than to the world. It is not even addressed to the Government.
 Let there be no misunderstanding nor lack of zeal among Congressmen because the resolution has postponed  satyagraha. Neither Jawaharlal nor Rajaji will let you remain idle. I certainly will not. Let those who think the constructive programme is insipid know that there is nothing in the Working Committee’s resolution to prevent  a Congressman at his own risk from leading civil disobedience— individual or mass. If he succeeds, he will win nothing but praise from all and I myself will kiss his feet. The more a person advances in ahimsa, the more proud will the Congress feel of him. But such  advance should not need any imprimatur from the Congress. But let me warn the enthusiasts that they will not handle the weapon with any success. They will only damage themselves and the cause by any hasty or ignorant action. And let me say as an expert  in  the  art  of satyagraha that those who regard the constructive programme as  insipid do not know what non-violence is and how it works. So much for civil disobedience.
 Let us now turn to the parliamentary mentality. Though it has come to stay in spite of my efforts to eradicate it, the parlia- mentary programme can, I hold, have no place in Congress work so long as the war lasts. The Congress cannot handle it without identi- fying itself with the war effort. I have always held that at all times it is the least important part of a nation’s activity. Legislators are not the masters but servants of their electors—the nation. The less, therefore, we look at and depend upon parliaments the better. Power resides in the people either through  their arms or through  their civil disobedience, more comprehensively described as non-violent non- co-operation. But the power of non-co-operation comes only through solid, incessant constructive work. Non-violent strength comes from the constructive programme only and not through destructive activi- ties. Hence the constructive programme is the only thing before the Congress today. And in this all parties are at one.
 There are instructions about the constructive programme for Congressmen. They form the operative part. If properly implemented, this would be a complete substitute for civil disobedience and the parliamentary programme. Civil disobedience has been wisely reserved for me as an expert in satyagraha. It is good, so long as I am alive and well in mind, that it is so reserved. I have almost put a stop to  it today. But the suspension of satyagraha is not linked with the resolution. So far as I am concerned, there will be no need for
 satyagraha, if the Government do not interfere with Harijan. For these three weeklies will constitute enough propaganda against all war. Harijan will try to carry the message of peace to all corners of the country. But if this is not permitted, then will be the time for civil disobedience as a gesture. I want every worker to be out for constructive activity.
 Today we have to serve the millions and that work does not allow us to get shut up in prisons. We do not wish that thieves and robbers may ransack the country. Even if we want to unleash a revolution, we shall have to provide for the prevention of pillage. The Congress will disappear if it fails to do this. The work of providing adequate food and clothing to the famished devolves on our shoulders. But if even the pen is snatched away from my hands, I may be compelled to become the sole resister. But I have no fixed plans. Events will point the way.libtech_694_footnote
 The suspension of satyagraha has connection only with the present condition of the country, and I want every single man who thinks with me to remain outside and do work rather than go to jail and read the Koran and the Gita and lead an easy life there. I won’t let them lead an easy life. Jawaharlal will ask for diaries  from thousands of men. He is not going to sleep. Therefore, if you will go away with the real message to the country, do not criticize this resolution. Nobody is rendered incapable of giving the fullest possible service, in fact he is made capable of the fullest growth, by reason of this resolution. Civil disobedience remains under my control, and the reason for its suspension is wholly extraneous to my retirement from office. Every one of you has to give a good account of yourself. If all will pull your full weight in the fulfilment of the constructive programme, you will find a different India in six months’ time.

   ADDRESS TO CONGRESS WORKERSlibtech_697_footnote  
 WARDHAGANJ,
 January 17, 1942 Gandhiji explained what had been achieved at Sevagram in regard to the restoration of communal unity and removal of untouchability and urged that they were assets which should be acquired whether freedom was obtained or not. He also pointed
 out what work had been done with regard to khadi and basic education.
 He dealt with the various aspects of the constructive programme,  with particular reference to Hindu-Muslim unity, the removal of untouchability, charkha and the organization of a volunteer corps.
 Mahatma Gandhi emphasized that a mere pact between the Congress and the Muslim League would not solve the problem; such a pact was applicable only to the carrying out of the parliamentary programme. He referred to the Lucknow Congress- League Pactlibtech_698_footnoteand said that real Hindu-Muslim unity could only be brought about by active constructive work.
 Answering a question, Gandhiji said that volunteer bodies must be organized but only on the basis of non-violence. The volunteers must render all help to the people. It was possible that these organizations might not be allowed to function. In such circumstances, they must carry on their work, if it was indispensable, even at the risk of their lives.libtech_699_footnote
Everyone who is a four-anna member of the Congress must
become a Khudai Khidmatgar now by service to the people.
 Concluding, Gandhiji exhorted them to carry out the instructions given by the Working Committee carefully, which alone would strengthen them in the struggle for freedom.

   TALK WITH A WORKERlibtech_700_footnote  
 [Before January 18, 1942]
 The would-be satyagrahilibtech_701_footnotesaid he was a believer in ahimsa. Gandhiji asked
 
How much do you spin—5 yards or 50 yards?
 Never more than 50, and sometimes even less than 5.
Do you spin every day, or once every week, or every month?
 I don’t spin more than 50 or 100 yards in a month.
Do you make your own slivers?
 No, Mahatmaji.
Then where do you get them from? Get them by post?
 No, I get them from the khadi bhandar, and when I do not get them there, I get
  them 	through friends coming from places where slivers can be had.  	Do you make you mal (string) yourself or do you purchase a 	reel from the market?  His 	friend intervened and said : “Mahatmaji, he is a believer in 	ahimsa, and that, I thought, was the essential qualification. 	According to the test you now apply we are all likely to fail.” Well, 	then it is better that none of you takes part in satyagraha  	than that you should go without being properly  qualified.  My 	standard is inexorable. I want you to spin not only regularly but 	intelligently. I want you to know how to test your yarn, how to draw 	fine yarn and coarse yarn, to know the economics of khadi and so on. 	And when you will say to me, ‘I know all these things’, I will 	ask you : ‘What about you life?’ Do you observe non-violence in 	your relations with the members of your family and in your daily 	affairs? Where is the good of your saying you accept non-violence in 	theory? Supposing you said you accepted the theory of khadi, but 	purchased and used foreign cloth, how would your acceptance of the 	theory help me? And please understand that, while in British India I 	am prepared to reconcile myself to belief in ahimsa as a policy, I 	want you in the States to believe in it as a creed. Violence in many 	Indian States is greater than in British India, and we want the 	supreme purity and sacrifice of a Prahlada to meet the violence 	there. Give me a Prahlada, and I shall give him my blessings.  Harijan, 	18-1-1942     
   LETTER TO ABDUL GHAFFAR KHAN  
 
 
SEVAGRAM,
 
    DEAR 	KHAN SAHEB,  January 	18, 1942 
  	Maulana Saheb and Jawaharlal had a long talk with me over your 	retiring from the Congress. They say that they never understood that 	you had contemplated withdrawal from the Congress. They said that 	the talk was plainly about withdrawal from the Working Committee 	only. They said too that in their opinion your withdrawal even from 	the W.C. was sure to be misunderstood and would harm the very cause 	you have at heart. Naturally you are the best judge of the 	situation. You would give due weight to their opinion. I can have no 	opinion. I rely entirely upon your judgement on the facts. If the 	facts are as they say, their opinion should prevail. If they are 	otherwise and you have no such fear as they entertain, your opinion 	should prevail.

   REAL WAR EFFORT  
 The greatest need of the immediate present is to feed the hungry and clothe the naked. There is already scarcity in the land both of food and clothing. As the war progresses, both the scarcities must increase. There are no imports from outside, either of food-stuff or of cloth. The well-to-do may not feel the pinch as yet or at all, but the poor are feeling it now. The well-to-do live on the poor. There is no other way. What is then their duty? He who saves gains as much, that is to say, he produces as much. Hence those who feel for the poor, those who would be one with them must curtail their wants. There are many ways. I shall only mention some here. There is much, too much food eaten and wasted by the well-to-do.
 Use one grain at a time. Chapati, rice, and pulses, milk, gur, ghee, and oil are used in ordinary households besides vegetables and fruit. I regard this as an unhealthy combination.  Those  who  get animal protein in the shape of milk, cheese, eggs or meat need not use pulses at all. The poor people get only vegetable protein. If the well- to-do give up pulses and oils, they set free these two essentials for the poor who get neither animal protein nor animal fat. Then the grain eaten should not be sloppy. Half the quantity suffices when it is eaten dry and not dipped in any gravy. It is well to eat it with raw salads such as onion, carrot, radish, salad leaves, tomatoes. An ounce or two of salads serves the purpose of eight ounces of cooked vegetables. Chapatis or bread should not be eaten with milk. To begin with, one meal may be raw vegetables and chapati or bread, and the  other cooked vegetables with milk or curds.
 Sweet dishes should be eliminated altogether. Instead, gur or sugar in small quantities may be taken with milk or bread or by itself.
 Fresh fruit is good to eat, but only a little is necessary to give tone to the system. It is an expensive article, and an over-indulgence by the well-to-do has deprived the poor and the ailing of an article which they need much more than the well-to-do.
 Any medical man who has studied the science of dietetics will certify that what I have suggested can do no harm to the body, on the contrary it must conduce to better health.
 This is only one way of saving food-stuff. It is obvious. But by itself it cannot produce much visible effect.
 Grain-dealers have to shed their greed and the habit of making as much profit as possible. They must be satisfied with as little as possible. They run the risk of being looted, if they do not gain the credit of being keepers of grain for the sake of the poor. They should
 be in touch with the people in their neighbourhood. Congressmen have to visit grain-dealers within their beat and give them the message of the time.
 By far the most important part of the work consists in educating the villagers to keep what they have and to induce cultivation of fresh crops wherever water is available. This requires widespread and intelligent propaganda. It is not generally known that bananas, potatoes, beetroot, yam and suran , and in a measure pumpkin are a food crop easily grown. They can take the place of bread in time of need.
 There is, too, scarcity of money. There may be grain available but no money to buy it with. There is no money because there is no employment. This has to be found. Spinning is the readiest and the handiest. But local needs may supply other sources of labour. Every available source has to be tapped so that there is no want of employment. Only the lazy ones need and must starve.  Patient  handling will induce even this class to shed their laziness.
 The problem of clothing is much easier than feeding, if it is handled well and in time. The mills may not be relied on in these times. There is ample cotton to be had in India. It is a problem for cotton cultivators how to dispose of their stock. The outside market is closed to them. Our mills cannot absorb the whole of the crop. It can be utilized, if the nation takes to spinning not for wages but for the sake of clothing the naked. Of course those who need employment will spin for profit. This number must be limited. They need organizing. Much money will be needed for the purpose. But national spinning does not need so much organizing. Profit motive being eliminated and willingness being assumed, organization is reduced to simplest terms.
 This is no time for multiplying wheels. They take time to manufacture. Raw materials are daily becoming dearer. Wheels cannot be manufactured everywhere. Places where they are can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
 Therefore I suggest the plying of the dhanush takli and even the simple takli. The former should be manufactured locally. Indeed it is difficult to manufacture the simple takli at once in lacs. The dhanush takli is the only thing which can be easiest manufactured. Slivers cannot be supplied to spinners. Each one should get some cotton for himself or herself, and card it as well as may be with the hand or with  a home-made small bow such as the children in the  Bihar  basic schools have. All this can be done because no one is expected to manufacture a large quantity of yarn. If every one of our available
 
 millions span for one hour daily, there would be enough yarn to keep every handloom going. The reader should know that there are lacs of handloom weavers in the land. There is danger of their starving for want of yarn.
 Here is a great task for every Congressman to undertake. He has to become a good spinner and carder and know how to manufacture the dhanush takli. Let every Congressman begin with himself and his family and neighbours, and he will find that the life-giving contagion spreads like wild fire which envelops you before you hardly know what you are witnessing.
 Any organization that tackles these two problems successfully will command the love and confidence of the people. I hope that all will join in this real war effort. It is none the less effective because it is peaceful and constructive.
 Will the Princes let their people do this work without let or hindrance? Will Quaid-e-Azam Jinnah allow the members of the Muslim League to co-operate with the Congress workers in this truly national but non-political work which is also humanitarian? There are 23,000 Muslim spinners, carders and weavers earning their daily bread through the A.I.S.A.

   CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMME AND GOVERNMENT  
 Will not the working of the constructive programme bring Congressmen into conflict with the Government? This was one of the many questions asked at the meeting of the principal members of the
 A. I. C. C. I addressed in Wardha on the 17th. My answer was that the whole programme was so conceived as to avoid conflict. Of course the most innocent activity may be so manipulated as to provoke conflict. I expect every Congress worker to do his best to avoid it. But there is no help for it, if the Government prohibit such activities because they are undertaken by Congressmen who believe that the working of the constructive programme will bring swaraj. That is the only non-violent way to achieve the end. Swaraj by non-violent means must come from the creative effort of those who desire it. The Government should welcome every such effort, unless they want to prevent even cent per cent non-violent movement. In that case conflict will become unavoidable. But I am of opinion that no conflict is possible, at any rate while the war lasts, unless the Congress workers want or provoke it. They have to work, work and work. They will make no speeches or
 demonstrations in doing their constructive work. As I have already said, today most of the items of constructive work happen to be—like feeding and clothing—common cause between the Government and the people.

   COMMUNAL UNITY  
 Freedom will not come through parliamentary effort. Therefore communal pacts, whilst they are good if they can be had, are valueless unless they are backed by the union of hearts. Without it there can be no peace in the land. Even Pakistan can bring no peace, if there is no union of hearts. This union can come only by mutual service and co- operative work.
 Separate electorates have resulted in the separation of hearts. They presupposed mutual distrust and conflict of interests. They have tended to perpetuate differences and deepen the distrust.
 How to get out of the tangle is the question. I want just now to confine myself to the four Muslim majority provinces. In them there is natural Pakistan in the sense that the permanent majority can rule the minority. I hold it to be utterly wrong thus to divide man from man by reason of religion which is liable to change. What conflict of interest can there be between Hindus and Muslims in the matter of revenue, sanitation, police, justice, or the use of public conveniences? The difference can only be in religious usage and observances with which a secular State has no concern.
 Congressmen, if they are not to merge in the Hindus as Hindus, must rigidly abstain from the legislatures and local bodies governed by separate electorates. In these provinces the  separate  electorates  must be taken to have come from the Hindu demand and in the supposed Hindu interest. But a Congress Hindu has no interest apart from his Muslim brother. Therefore he must not enter the electoral bodies where Hindu and Muslim interests are falsely regarded as separate and even antagonistic. If he enters these bodies, he can do so only to divide the majority members, i.e., to take sides  with  one Muslim party or another. If I could make all Hindus Congress- minded, I would withdraw every Hindu member from these bodies and put the Muslim members on their honour. I would seek to influence them from outside these bodies by being friends with them and rendering disinterested service. I would be indifferent to their manning all the services. At the most an infinitesimal percentage can
 have a share in them. And it is a superstition to suppose that these services can oppress a people who have become
 conscious of human dignity and human rights and know how to enforce them. Since the vast majority of Congressmen are Hindus in at least three Muslim majority provinces, they have a rare opportunity of showing their non-violent strength, their  disinterestedness,  their utter freedom from the communal taint, and their ability to submit to the rule of their Muslim fellow-countrymen. They will do this not in a huff but as true nationalists and friends of the Muslims. Remaining outside they will probably better protect the just interests of Hindus as citizens. For a Congress Hindu is not any the less a Hindu because he claims to represent equally, as he must, all the other faiths in himself. For as I have said, so far as the State is concerned, its capacity for service stops short of the service of the different faiths, and  the services it can render apply to all irrespective of their faiths. Therefore Congressmen have a rare opportunity of showing undefiled nationalism in these provinces. They will incidentally show the other minorities that they have nothing to fear from the majorities if they know the true way. We must get out of the miasma of religious majorities and minorities. Why is a Parsi’s interest different from a Hindu’s or Muslim’s so far as the State is concerned? Did not Dadabhai and Pherozeshah rule the Congress while they lived, not by Congress grace or patronage, but by right of service and merit? Did their rule injure any Hindu or Muslim interest? Were these interests ever in conflict on the Congress platform? And is not the Congress a voluntary State?

   QUESTION BOX  
 CONGRESS AND A. R. P.
 Q. Can a Congressman belong to A.R.P. and such other committees connected with the war?
 A. I think not. But this does not mean that he will render no help in caring for those who may be injured by bombs or otherwise. On the contrary he will be expected to be most assiduous in rendering such help.
 ECONOMIC EQUALITY
 Q. While working the constructive programme, can a Congressman preach economic equality? How can working the civil disobedience programme bring it about?
 A. You can certainly preach it, if your speech is strictly non- violent and not in the manner of some who, I know, have preached forcible dispossession of landowners and capitalists. But I have shown  a better way than preaching. The constructive programme takes the country a long way towards the goal. This is the most auspicious time for it. The charkha and the allied industries, if fully successful, practically abolish all inequalities, both social and economic.  The rising consciousness of the strength which non-violence gives to the people, and their intelligent refusal to co-operate in their slavery must bring about equality.
 STRENGTHEN THE ORGANIZATION
 Q.	What is the meaning of strengthening the Congress organization?
 A. You can strengthen it no doubt by enlisting members who know the meaning of the fundamental article of the Congress, namely, attainment of Purna Swaraj by peaceful and legitimate means. Enlisting of bogus members and members for seizing power in the Congress is vicious and harmful.
 There is no room for power politics within the Congress, if the Congress is to end the power or the system that grinds the people and be itself in power. Therefore real strengthening of the organization consists in every Congressman working the constructive programme to its fullest capacity. Enlisting bona fide members without much effort provides running expense of the Congress, only if the enlisting itself does not eat up the subscriptions you collect from members.
 ‘OTHER ORGANIZATIONS’
 Q. What do you mean by associating with other volunteer organizations working for similar ends? Do you include communal organizations?
A.	I do. Unfortunately we have very few other non-communal
 organizations. ‘Similar ends’ naturally means constructive ends, using ‘constructive’ in the widest sense of the term. Thus you will tender your help to a Muslim League or Hindu Sabha volunteer in putting out fire or tending the wounded. You will also invite their help in such matters.

   SPEECH AT BENARES HINDU UNIVERSITYlibtech_703_footnote  
 January 21, 1942
 REVERED MALAVIYAJI, SIR RADHAKRISHNAN, BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 You all know very well that I have neither the physical strength nor the inclination to undertake a long journey, and yet when I received Sir Radhakrishnan’s invitation to deliver an address on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee Convocation of the Benares Hindu University I had not the heart to decline it. You know the strong bond of affection that binds me to Malaviyaji, and it is with a  certain  amount of pride and satisfaction that I obey his behest whenever it is at all possible for me. I therefore could not say ‘no’, Sir Radhakrishnan’s letter was a call to a pilgrimage.
 Great as are Malaviyaji’s services to the country,  I  have  no doubt that this University constitutes his greatest service and achievement, and he has worn himself out for the work that is dear to him as life itself. It was out of my great regard for him that twenty- five years ago I accepted his invitation to attend the foundation ceremony of this  University.libtech_704_footnotelibtech_705_footnoteI  knew  that  in  that  august  function, which was to be attended by the Viceroy and the ruling Princes of India, there was no place for a poor man like me. I had not then been made a Mahatma, and if anyone called me by that name, I knew I must have been mistaken for Mahatma Munshiramji, as the late Swami Shraddhanand was then called. For there cannot be a number of Mahatmas, and I knew even when I was in South Africa that Munshiramji’s great work had entitled him to that name. He also was one of those who sent me messages of congratulations and compassion. In those days too Malaviyaji Maharaj showered his kindness on me. But he has a knack for detecting servants of the people, however obscure they may be, and bringing them into his fold. This is his usual trick.
 People have great admiration for Malaviyaji Maharaj as you must have heard today. He deserves every word of it. I know the Hindu University is a huge affair. There is no greater beggar than Malaviyaji on the face of the earth. He has never begged for himself; by the grace of God he has never been in want, but he became a voluntary beggar for causes he has made his own, and God has always filled his bowl in an overflowing measure. But he has an insatiable
 
 appetite, and although he got a crore and ten lacs instead of the crore he wanted he is still asking for more. Even at this moment he  whispered into my ears that he had a good donation from the Maharaja of Darbhanga, our Chairman. I know how Malaviyaji leads his own life. It has been my privilege to be acquainted with every aspect of his life. It is a rare good fortune to have him still in our midst, a living example of a pure life of plain living and high thinking; the students particularly can draw many a lesson from his life but I have a fear that, though he is physically in your midst, many of you are untouched by his great example. The fault is wholly ours, not his. The sun radiates heat and light to all on earth, but how can even the sun help those who will shut themselves from him? But I am not here to sing Malaviyaji’s praises. Who can be more unfortunate than the one who in spite of being so near to him fails to imbibe his noble qualities such as his simplicity, sacrifice, patriotism, generosity and universal love?
 I must now address a few words to you—the teachers and the students of the Vidyapith. When I accepted Sir Radhakrishnan’s invitation he had asked me to send a copy of my address to him. I told him that I had no time to write anything, I did not even know what I should be able to say. A feeling of nervousness overpowers me when I am in the midst of learned men. Ever since my return to India my lot has been cast among the poor and the downtrodden—those whom the Congress represents—and whilst in their midst I feel no sense of constraint or hesitation. In your midst I feel tongue-tied. I simply said to Sir Radhakrishnan that I should trust to the inspiration of the moment. That inspiration has come, but I do not know how you will welcome my plain-speaking.
 As speaker after speaker spoke and left the dais, I longed for someone who would address the audience in Hindi or Urdu, or Hindustani, aye, even in Sanskrit,—even in Marathi, or for that matter in any of the Indian languages. But no such good luck befell me and you. Why? We are slaves and have hugged the language of those who have kept us enslaved. It has become a fashion to blame the Englishmen for all our ills. I have not hesitated to blame them for many things they have done. I have never charged them with compelling us to adopt English as the medium of expression. We devote precious years of our lives to learning the English language, our ambition being to be able to speak English as Englishmen, and our breast swells with pride when an Englishman pats us on our back for speaking flawless English. Think of the time and energy of our youth expended on learning the English language, as if it was our mother tongue, and calculate by simple multiplication the number of
 years and the volume of precious energy that are lost to the nation.
 And yet all this is happening in the Benares Hindu University which has been extolled today as the living embodiment of Indian culture. Malaviyaji did all that was necessary to draw the best possible teachers by attractive salaries, but he could not do the rest. It was not his fault that Hindi did not take the place of English. The teachers are the product of the tradition which they have inherited, and the  students are content to accept what they get from them. They need not be. They go on strikes and even hunger-strikes, often for trivial reasons. Why will they not insist on having their tuition in the all-India language? There are, we were told today, 250 students here from the Andhra Province. Let them go to Sir Radhakrishnan and ask for an Andhra section of the University and ask to be taught through the medium of Telugu if they will not learn the all-India language. But if they were to be guided by my lights, being Indians they  should demand as the medium of instruction a language understood throughout India. And Hindustani alone can be that language.
 You know what has happened in Japan—a country which I do not regard as essentially great—but which is regarded as great in Asia in that it has successfully challenged the supremacy of America and England. The thouands of boys and girls in the Japanese schools and colleges receive their education not through the medium of English but through Japanese. Their script is difficult, but it is no bar to their learning it and they have not given it up in preference to the Roman. Not that they boycott English and other European language. But they economize their energy. Those who need to learn them do so for enriching the Japanese thought with knowledge which the West alone can give. They take care to turn into Japanese all that is worth taking from the West. That is because the mind of Japan’s youth is fresh and alert. The knowledge gained thus has become national  property.  There would have been no greater folly if instead of doing so they had thrown their mother tongue to the winds and opened English medium schools and colleges such as we find in other countries. In this way they might well have learnt a new language but the Japanese people could not have gained the new knowledge. Our ambition does not go beyond becoming clerks in Government offices, lawyers, barristers, judges, all helplessly serving the system they would fain destroy. And we have not succeeded in mastering the English language either. After all, is it not an alien language? I get numerous letters from English-educated people—some of them possessing the highest degrees of our universities—but they betray  a  woeful ignorance of the English language. The reason is simple. Malaviyajis and Radhakrishnans are rare, and the thousands cannot achieve what
 
 they have done.
 As I was listening to the English speeches I was amazed at the patience and innate courtesy of our people who, though they do not understand a word of what is said, do not mob us, as they well might do. If there is any doubt in your minds about this, I can demonstrate to you by a show of hands how few—even from among the students— have followed the proceedings here. I had said all this when I came here twenty-five years ago. What I have seen today compels me to repeat it all.
 There is another thing to which I am tempted to draw your attention. I witnessed this morning a scene that I had least expected here. There was a Vasant Panchami daylibtech_706_footnoteprocession of the students who had to march past Malaviyaji’s house after receiving his silent blessings. The way in which they were walking betrayed a lack of even elementary physical training. Instead of walking in step, erect and disciplined like soldiers on the march, they walked haphazardly in a desultory fashion. Their walking could hardly be called a march. In my opinion they are so much burdened with English that they find no time to attend to other things. That is why they are unable to learn the things they must.
 I noticed another thing while returning after a visit to Shri Shivprasad Gupta in the morning. I cannot help saying a word about the sight that greets you as you enter the great portals of the  University. Thanks to the money that Malaviyaji can get  for  the asking, the gate is in consonance with the splendour of the edifices here. But what did I find on the top of the gate?—the bulk of the space (three-fourths) taken up by the words BENARES HINDU UNIVERSITY in English, and one-fourth given to the inscription in Hindi which is the language through which you would derive your knowledge. I wondered what need there was of the English language? Malaviyaji cannot be blamed for this. It must have been the work of some engineer. Just a little thought on the part of those who were in charge of such things would have been enough to tell them that what was needed there was the name written in Devanagari and Persian scripts— which would have symbolized to the people the desire on the part of Malaviyaji’s University and Sir Radhakrishnan for communal  harmony. It would have been in the fitness of things too, as both Hindi and Urdu are understood in this region and both the scripts are familiar. The fact that it is written in English is an indication of the domination of the English language over our minds.
We are scared of learning a new language or a script, whereas
 
 for us learning an Indian language or a script should be as easy as anything. Surely it is no difficult thing for a non-Hindi-speaking person to learn Hindi or Hindustani. I can undertake to teach Hindi to anyone knowing Gujarati, Bengali or Marathi in the space of three months. Even the South Indian  languages—Tamil,  Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada—are full of Sanskrit words and, if there was just a little fervour and love of the country in us, we should not hesitate to decide to write all the languages derived from Sanskrit as also the Southern group in the Devanagari script. These languages have not only a fairly common vocabulary, there is also a striking resemblance in the scripts. If our minds were not fagged, we would easily know half a dozen Indian languages. Then there is Urdu which should not be difficult to learn, if only our Urdu scholars did not make it a matter of pride to pack it with Persian and Arabic words, as the pundits pack Hindi with Sanskrit words. The result is that I am completely at a loss when high-flown Urdu of the Lucknow style is flung at me.
 One more thought I should like to leave with you. Every university is supposed to have its tradition, its distinctive feature— Oxford and Cambridge, for instance, have theirs. They take pride in the fact that the students they turn out can at once be identified for the distinctive impression left on them by the universities. Our universities leave no such distinctive mark. But I am afraid our universities are the blotting-sheets of the West. We have borrowed the superficial features of the Western universities, and flattered ourselves that we have founded living universities here. Do they reflect or respond to the needs of the masses? Now I am told that a special feature of your University is that engineering and technology are taught here as nowhere else. I should not consider this a distinguishing feature. Let me make a suggestion to you. Have you been able to attract to your University youths from Aligarh? Have you been able to identify yourselves with them? That, I think, should be your special work, the special contribution of your University. Money has come  in,  and more will come in if God keeps Malaviyaji in our midst for a few more years. But no amount of money will achieve the miracle I want—I mean a heart-unity between Hindus and Muslims. I would like you to go out to invite Mussalmans to come here, and not to mind if they reject your advances. You are the representatives of a great civilization which according to Lokamanya Tilak is 10,000 years old and according to later scholars even older. This civilization regards ahimsa as the supreme dharma. This has been our tradition from the times of the Vedas. The special contribution of that civilization is to befriend the world, to turn so-called foes into friends. Our civilization has absorbed, like the holy Ganga, many streams from outside, and it
 
 is my prayer that the Hindu University which is endeavouring to represent Hindu culture and Hindu civilization may invite and absorb all that is best in other cultures and nurse hostility towards none. That should be its distinctive feature. English will not help you to evolve this. It is our own ancient learning that will teach you this—our scriptures learnt and understood in the proper spirit.
 One thing more and I have done. You are living in palatial hostels, but you should not get used to living in palaces. Look at the little house in which Panditji lives in utter simplicity and without the least splendour. You enter his room. There is no decoration and only the barest furniture. You, who will be his heirs, should model your lives accordingly. Many of you are children of poor parents. Don’t forget that you have to represent the poor, and that therefore a life of ease and luxury is inconsistent with the poverty of our land. May you be all models of plain and simple living and high thinking like Malaviyaji. May God bless you with long life and the wisdom to carry out what I have said, if it has appealed to you.

   DISCUSSION WITH CONGRESS WORKERSlibtech_707_footnote  
 BENARES,
 January 22, 1942
 Q. What is your ultimate object? Do you want the Congress to accept your principles or to achieve its object?
 A. Every plan and programme that I have placed before the Congress has been placed with a view to achieving the goal of independence. Truth and non-violence are a matter of creed for me— you may call it my religion, but it has not been my object to propagate that religion through the Congress. Before the Congress they have been placed as effective means to an  end—as  political means for a political objective, as I did in South Africa. If it was otherwise, I should cease to be a political worker and occupy the position of a  dharmagurulibtech_708_footnotelibtech_709_footnote.  The  political  method  can  be  changed whenever expedient, but the change should be honest and deliberate. But one should not pretend to adhere to the method when really in practice one has given it up. That would be deceiving oneself and the
 
 world.
 Q. We should like to have a glimpse of the next six months of a year as you picture it to yourself. You have often said that this is a fight to the finish, your last fight which will not end until the goal is won. What are likely to be the future developments as you can visualize them?
 A. It is a good question, and also a difficult question. Not that I am not clear, but because it takes us into the realm of speculation. I let things and happenings react on me—though I confess I do not follow everything as Jawaharlal with his study of foreign affairs can. Jawaharlal is convinced that the British Empire is finished. We all wish that it may be finished, but I do not think it is finished. We know that the Britishers are tough fighters, we know what the Empire—especially India—means to every home in Britain, and therefore they will never consent to be ‘Little Englanders’. Mr. Churchill has said that they are not “sugar candies”, and that they can meet rough with rough. Therefore it will be long before the Empire is finished. There is no doubt, however, that they are nearing the end, and what Jawaharlal has said is very true that, if we could do nothing to prevent the war, we certainly will do much to prevent a peace in which we have no voice. That is what every Congressman has to bear in mind. We have, therefore, to be up and doing. If we sit with folded hands, we may have a peace which we do not desire.
 I adhere to the statement that it is my final fight, but we have had to alter our programme because of the latest  developments, because war has come to our door. The suspension had nothing to do with my retirement from the official leadership of the Congress. Even if it had continued, how could I today ask Jawaharlal to march back to jail? Of course he will be in jail, if he is prevented from doing the work we have chalked out. But things have happened so rapidly that we had not the slightest idea of what was coming. How then can I talk of a year or even six months ahead? That we are marching swiftly towards independence I have no doubt. There is no doubt about the programme ahead of us. No Congressman should rest content with just paying his four-anna fee. He has to be active all the twenty-four hours. Even the one concrete programme of production of cloth is sufficient to occupy all our energies. There are 4,000 students in the Benares Hindu University. Will they spin an hour every day? I am talking of spinning because it is a thing nearest my heart, but there are a hundred and one other things. Have the villagers enough food to eat? Have they enough to cover themselves in this bitter cold? These are the questions that occur to me again and again. On our capacity to feed the starving and clothe the naked and generally to serve the masses in the time of their need will depend our capacity to influence
 the peace whenever it comes. What I have said applies to all parties. Whoever serves the purpose best will survive and have an effective voice.
 Q.	You think they cannot have a treaty just as they like?
 A. I do. The days of secret treaties are gone, I hope. If we behave ourselves, we can have a decisive voice at least so far as we are concerned. But Jawaharlal can explain these things better. I am no student of history or even of contemporary events in the world.
 Q. Why did you advise the A.I.C.C. members to support the Bardoli Resolution, though at one stage you had decided to divide the house?  Rajaji’s speeches after the A.I.C.C. are against the Bombay Resolution, and even expediency dictates that there can be no co-operating with a dying Empire.
 A.   I  am afraid you are ‘estopped’ from asking the question, if  I may use a legal term. But as you have asked the question, and there is nothing to hide, I may answer it. In fact I answered it in my speech before the A. I. C. C.,libtech_710_footnotelibtech_711_footnoteif you listened to it with attention. Well, then, let me tell you that, though I am old in age, my mind is not decaying. It is ever growing, and the decision not to divide the house indicates my growth or evolution in my own non-violence.libtech_712_footnote
 Mahatma Gandhi said that after he had made his attitude on the question known since the Bardoli decision, he had come to realize that as the majority of the Working Committee members, representing, as they do, the large bulk of Congressmen, were not prepared to go the whole hog with him on the question of non-violence, it would have become unfair to clinch the issue at Wardha, for he was confident that if he had insisted upon the question being decided by a vote, a large number of the A.I.C.C. members, perhaps in spite of their conscience, would have voted in support of his attitude. That could have been a decision obviously  misrepresenting  the  real situation. It would have been harmful in the extreme, and hence he decided that he should plead for the support of the Working Committee’s resolution. Wrong assumptions could never lead to right results.libtech_713_footnote
 To divide the house appeared to me a piece of violence. If every one of the members of the A. I. C. C. was a pukka believer in political non-violence, it would have been a different matter. But I knew that such was not the case. The Bardoli Resolution was a true reflection of the Congress mind. In such matters majority and minority do not count. And there was nothing to prevent the whole-hoggers to go whatever length they liked.
The contingency of co-operation is, if anything, very remote.
 
 Until then all have to act in terms of non-violence. When the contingency does arise the whole-hoggers can secede from the Congress. In fact we can then meet again and put the whole matter to vote.
 Q.	Would it be proper or improper to defend oneself with arms against
 atatayis (confirmed offenders) in case of disturbances?
 A. The answer has been already given by me and also by the Congress. And the word atatayi is bad for our purpose. And don’t ask what is proper and improper. If you were to ask me, I should say it is improper. If you are non-violent, do not have resort to arms. If you cannot muster non-violence of the brave, defend yourself as best [as] you can. The law gives everyone the right of self-defence against a dacoit, and the Congress does not take away the legal right. But in riots or communal disturbances, he who calls himself a Congressman has to act non-violently. That is the resolution of the Congress. Even there if your courage fails you and you use force, the Congress will not censure you, for the simple reason that the  Congress  never intended to encourage cowardice.
 Q. You are said to have permitted khadi bhandars to sell blankets to Government. It is not co-operation in the war effort?
 A. I did. It was not proper for me to ask whether the blankets were for the use of soldiers or for someone else. The case is different when a man sells fire-arms or swords or poison. The vendor has to inquire how the fire-arms are to be used, and the chemist has to ask for the doctor’s certificate. On the other hand a rice-seller will not, and is under no obligation to inquire who is going to consume the rice.libtech_714_footnote
 Admitting that it was very difficult to draw the line of demarcation, Mahatma Gandhi said the principal criterion from his point of view was for the supplier to consider how his supply would be utilized. Of course, his view on the question was not necessarily that of the Congress and Congressmen were free to object to it without acquiescing in the butchery in which the soldiers were engaged. It was quite conceivable that the blankets supplied to them served to spare them the hardships of  a severe winter, the more so when they were maimed or wounded in the battle. There was the underlying humanitarian motive in making these supplies and that could not be questioned as co-operation in the war effort.
 But you may go further than I did. If you think I erred, you are at liberty to denounce me. If you think a non-violent man may not sell rice or blankets to soldiers, you are welcome to your interpretation of non-violence. I for one will not hesitate to give water or food to a
 
 soldier who comes to me with hands red with murder. My humanity would not let me do otherwise.
 The question of spurious khadi was next discussed, and Gandhiji said :
 A great deal depends on intelligent and wide-awake public opinion. If the public takes it into its mind to prevent the spread of this khadi, it can easily do so. But we have not cultivated what Lord Willingdon used to call the courage to say ‘No’. Those who are interested in khadi are all shareholders of the A. I. S. A., and it is their duty to take up this work. To feed the hungry and clothe the naked is our immediate programme, and you have all to lend a hand effectively. If you all do so, the question of spurious khadi will not arise. No Congressman can deal in spurious khadi.libtech_715_footnote
 Stressing the importance of Congressmen concentrating on khadi, Mahatma Gandhi said that by virtue of their commitment to the Congress constructive programme whereof the khadi movement was the most important part, the responsibility of clothing Indians in the immediate future was devolving upon the shoulders of Congressmen and they would soon be tested as to their ability to discharge it. Inquiries made by him from Indian millowners had revealed that cloth stocks were very limited and fast diminishing. And such of them as were held were being manipulated by persons dealing in futures (satta). Not only the public, said Mahatma Gandhi, but also the Government of the country would knock at his doors for more and ever more of khadi in the near future. That time was fast approaching. He hoped that Congressmen would not be found unprepared to meet the situation.
 The last question was about the Congressmen’s duty in times of raids and scares and consequent disturbances.
 The emergency is there today. Dacoities are rampant, and unless the Congress asserts itself effectively, the situation will go out of our hands. The need for peace brigades was never more urgent than now.libtech_716_footnoteThe risk of death is there, whether you choose violence or non- violence. Why not then prepare yourselves to die non-violently? It will also enable you to offer effective resistance in case of a civil war. As for the protection of the wounded in air raids, the bulk of the work will come upon yourselves. You will not join the A. R. P., simply because you will be then parts of a machine over which you have no control and you would be active participants in the war effortlibtech_717_footnote. But it
 
 been already made clear.”
 is certain that the Government will not be able to render assistance everywhere. Did they do so in Rangoon? We have harrowing tales of the dead and wounded lying on the streets of Rangoon uncared for. Wherever, therefore, the authorities fail there will be enough scope of work for us. We have to prepare
 volunteers for this work ready to take risks and to act with initiative. We may have to remove the dead and wounded, take charge of vacant houses, and so on. In this work you will heartily co-operate with the authorities wherever they will accept your co-operation.libtech_718_footnote
 Mahatma Gandhi said that . . . nothing was expected to deter them from organizing volunteer squads and offering such relief as was possible in emergencies in co-operation with the Government organization, if necessary, and in spite of it, if possible, regardless of the consequences. For instance, after an air raid if there were persons trapped in a crumbling house or a house on fire, it was the duty  of Congressmen to extricate them and pull down the house, lest it should collapse and take a toll of life, without waiting to see whether the official organization’s aid, sanction or a request for co-operation was forthcoming.
 Mahatma Gandhi was all humour at the conference and Acharya J. B. Kripalani, General Secretary of the Congress, was the butt of it. Mahatma Gandhi said :
 Kripalani was morose formerly, because I thought he was not married. But, even when he is married and has a very good partner in life, his mood haunts him.
 Harijan, 8-2-1942, and National Herald, 24-1-1942
 
   HINDUSTANI  
  The 	proceedings of 	the Congress, the 	A.I.C.C. and 	the Working Committee 	shall ordinarily be 	conducted in 	Hindustani. The 	English language 	or any 	Provincial language may 	be used, 	if the 	speaker is 	unable to 	speak in 	Hindustani or whenever 	permitted by the President.  The 	proceedings of 	the Provincial Congress 	Committee shall 	ordinarily be 	conducted in 	the language of 	the Province concerned. 	Hindustani may 	also be used. 
 —Article 25 of the Congress Constitution The Congress has not carried out this resolution to any appreciable extent. It is a sad reflection. The fault is Congressmen’s. They will not take the trouble of learning Hindustani. Their effort for learning languages is evidently exhausted with the performance of the impossible task of acquiring a knowledge of the English language equal to a learned Englishman’s. The result is tragic. It has meant
 
 impoverishment of the provincial languages and displacement of the all-India language described by the Congress as Hindustani. It has also meant a break between the millions and the English-educated few who happen to be the natural leaders for the simple reason that they are the only educated class. There is no education worth the name apart from the schools established by the Government. The Congress has to perform the Herculean task of dissplacing the English language with Hindustani. With the passing of the resolution it should have created a bureau for fulfilling, the purpose as it might do even now. But if it does not, individual Congressmen and those  who  are interested in evolving an all-India language should do so.
 But what is Hindustani? There is no such language apart from Urdu and Hindi. Urdu has sometimes been called Hindustani. Did the Congress mean Urdu in the Article quoted? Did it exclude the more extensively known Hindi? Such a meaning would be absurd. It evidently meant, and could only mean, a scientific blend of Hindi and Urdu. There is no such written blend extant. But it is the common speech of the unlettered millions of Hindus and Muslims living in Northern India. Not being written, it is imperfect, and he written language has taken two different turns tending to widen the difference by each running away from the other. Therefore the word Hindustani means Hindi and Urdu. Therefore also Hindi can  call  itself Hindustani, if it does not exclude Urdu but tries to assimilate Urdu as much as is scientifically possible without damaging the natural structure and music of the original. Urdu can do likewise. There is no separate Hindustani body attempting to blend the two streams which today threaten to run away from each other.
 The noble task can be performed by the  Hindi  Sahitya Sammelan and Anjuman-e-taraqqi-e-Urdu. I have been connected with the former since 1918libtech_719_footnotelibtech_720_footnotewhen I was invited to preside at its session of that year. I aequainted the audience with my views on the all-India medium. When I presided again at its session in 1935libtech_721_footnotelibtech_722_footnote, I was able to persuade the Sammelan to define Hindi as the language spoken by Hindus and Muslims of the North of India and written either in Devanagari or Persian script. The natural consequence should have been for the members of the Sammelan to expand their knowledge of Hindi by living up to the definition and producing literature that
 
 20-4-1935.
 could be read by both Hindus and Muslims. This
 should have meant the members learning the Persian script. They seem to have denied themselves this proud privilege. But better late than never. Will they bestir themselves now? They need not wait for the Anjuman to respond. It will be a great thing, if the Anjuman does. Each Association can, if it will, work in harmony with the other. But I have suggested unitary action independent of the other party. That Association which will adopt my plan will enrich the language it stands for, and will ultimately be responsible for producing a blend which will serve the whole nation.
 It is unfortunate that the Hindi-Urdu question has assumed a communal shape. It is possible for either party to undo the mischief by recognizing the other and incorporating the acceptable part in a generous spirit. A language that borrows unstintingly from the others without harming its special characteristic will be enriched, even as the English language has become enriched by free borrowings.
 ON THE WAY TO WARDHA, January 23, 1942
 Harijan, 1-2-1942
 
   SPEECH AT CHOKHAMELA BOARDING HOUSElibtech_723_footnote  
 NAGPUR,
 January 24, 1942
 Gandhiji began to address the gathering. There was noise. In a moment a youthlibtech_724_footnotesprang to his feet and said : “This is not the ordinary noise. We are protesting against your coming.” Gandhiji invited him to come to the rostrum and say what he wanted to say. He had nothing more to say than this : “We do not want you here. Those who invited you here had no right to do so.” Asked Gandhiji of him :
But why don’t you want me here?
 Because you have done nothing for the Harijans.
That’s all? Have you anything more to say?
 “Nothing more,” he said, and after a while disappeared.
 I am told by the friend who raised the voice of protest that those who invited me here had no right to do so. The fact is that it was the students   of   the    Chokhamelalibtech_725_footnoteBoarding    House    who    came    to Wardha to invite me. I had begged to be excused, but Shri Chaturbhuj
 
 
 Jasani intervened and told me that, if the work that carried me to Benares was after my heart, this might be even dearer in as much as it was the silver jubilee of an institution that had served Harijan boys. And since the abolition of untouchability is my life’s work and I even toured the country for the same cause for one whole yearlibtech_726_footnote, I agreed.
 But assuming that those who invited me had no right to do so, it was surely not my fault. These protests do not displease me. The Harijans have suffered all these centuries at the hands of the savarna Hindus as from no one else, and as I am one of the latter I am participant in their sin. And I am never accustomed to weigh my sins in golden scales. I can atone for them only if I made a mountain of a molehill. The reason is simple. Man can never see his faults in proper perspective, and if he really did so, he would scarcely survive them. The remedy is, therefore, to magnify one’s shortcomings. And the sin of untouchability is so heinous that it is impossible to exaggerate it. Those who suffer from it are naturally liable to be angry with those who are trying to wipe it out. They may well say to me : ‘Who are you to remove untouchability? We shall wipe it out our own strength.’ Now the way of demonstrating one’s strength is of two kinds : one is the eternal, God-given way of self-purification, where man takes the blame upon himself of all the wrongs he is suffering from; the other is the way of retaliation, the Mosaic law of tooth for a tooth and nail for a nail. The latter is quite natural in that we have descended from the state of brutes, and some of their qualities may have been exaggerated in us. It is Hitler’s way. Because a Jew or many Jews may have wronged the Germans he thinks it is his duty to exterminate the whole Jewish race. To those Harijans who would destroy caste Hindus and Hinduism I would say that the Hindus deserve it. But the caste Hindus too owe a duty to themselves and their religion. Let them receive lathis and stones from Harijans. But they should continue to serve them.
 What, however, is to be done, if they will not receive our service?libtech_727_footnote
 Let the stones rain on us, we have to keep quiet and to hold this meeting. I had promised to stay here for ten minutes, but I am in no hurry to go now. Send word to the demonstrators that, if they will have a separate meeting, I am prepared to stay and address  that meeting and answer the charges they may have to make against me. And what after all is my crime? That I am labouring for them? That I am endeavouring to put a little money into their pockets? That I am
 
 telling the sanatanists day in and day out that they have to purge themselves of their sin? And why rain stones on the  innocent audience?
 They wanted to hurt me, but what have they succeeded in doing? They have hurt a few innocent people including two children in the audience. If they wanted to punish me or those who invited me, they should have gone directly for us. Let me tell them that this hooliganism is the opposite of bravery, humanity, civility. Let me tell them they are going about the wrong way. They are injuring their own cause.
 Now a word to those assembled here. Though this is a boarding house, those who receive their board and lodging here are all students. I hope your stay here will be fruitful and give you what is real education. Let today’s demonstration be a lesson to you. It should make you neither angry nor afraid, for anger and fear are twin sins. Let the demonstration awaken you to your sense of duty and burn the eternal truth indelibly on your minds that only Truth quenches  untruth, Love, quenches anger, self-suffering quenches violence. This eternal rule is a rule not for saints only but for all. Those who observe it may be few but they are the salt of the earth, it is they who keep the society together, not those who sin against light and truth.
 I ask you not only not to punish the demonstrators but not even to have the wish. They are not wicked. It is through them that God works to open our eyes to the wickedness within us. Let, therefore, today’s demonstration purify you, as I know it will purify me. True vidya (knowledge) is the art of self-purification. Now I want you to stay here until the storm ceases, lest your going out just now should infuriate them. Let us wait until their fury ceases, and then quietly go back to our homes. In the mean while let us all recite Ramdhun together, let someone give us a hymn, and we shall disperse only when we are told that everything is quiet outside.libtech_728_footnote
 Harijan, 1-2-1942
 
   TO GUJARATISlibtech_729_footnote  
 You have sacrificed a great deal in the cause of swaraj. But it is not enough. You can contribute still more in the form of money, labour, and increasingly intelligent and fresh minds.
Is it not sad that Rs. 2 lakhs worth of khadi only is being
 
 
 produced in Gujarat whereas Rs. 12 lakhs worth is wanted? It may be that there is not so much poverty in Gujarat as in the other provinces. But that does not mean that Gujaratis cannot, if they wish, produce all the khadi they need. Reckoning the population of Gujarat at 1 crore, the people would need at least 3 crores worth of cloth. You should produce at least this quantity, i.e., 15 crore yards.
 The time is fast approaching when we shall not be able to get mill-cloth. There is scarcity even today, and what if the mills are bombed, what if they are used as munition factories? Either each one of us, young and old, rich and poor, man and woman, has to spin and provide for his own clothing or else go naked. There is not the least exaggeration in this. In the warring countries people are rationed for food and clothing,libtech_730_footnoteand as the war is prolonged even the necessities of life are being used up and munitions are produced only to end in smoke. The war is thus working double destruction.
 We have been will-nilly dragged into the vortex. But we are not yet so hard put to it as the people in the warring countries. If, however, we sit with folded hands until the trouble comes upon us, we shall be found to have been foolslibtech_731_footnote. We must be wise and adopt the necessary measures in time.libtech_732_footnote
 It is my request then to those Gujaratis whose ears I can reach that they should give as much money and as much yarn as they can to the Mahagujarat Khadi Mandal. Receiving centres should be opened where necessary so as to save people the cost of posting yarn. The master-key to producing the requisite khadi lies in the wheel plying in every home. If good yarn is spun, weavers will be available, though I have already advised that we should take time by the forelock and train voluntary weavers also.
 Will every Congressman rise to the occasion and spin for the nation?

   A DEPLORABLE INCIDENTlibtech_733_footnote  
 As Sardar Vallabhbhai was leaving Sevagram the other day he told  me  of  a  dacoity  in  a  homelibtech_734_footnotelibtech_735_footnotein Kheda District. Armed  dacoits entered the house, belaboured the inmates, and escaped with the loot. The story was heart-rending. What should I do under similar circumstances, I thought to myself. What should Congressmen do in the circumstances was the next thought; and since then the train of thought arising from the dacoity has taken possession of me. The Congress has been working continuously since 1920 under the policy of non-violence. The province of Gujarat has also had the advantage of a leader of the Sardar’s calibre. And yet daring dacoities can take place. How far then can Congress influence be said to have penetrated? People imagine that, if the British Government were to cease to function today, it would be the non-violent Congressmen who would automatically take over. But it is not so. I have been working to this end for the last twenty years, but my dream has not materialized. For the Congress has not had a living faith in the very means which it adopted in 1920. Therefore the non-violence of the Congress has really been non-violence of the weak. But governments can only be run by the strong. And a non-violent government can only be run by those who believe that non-violence is the mightiest force on earth. If we had had this strength, there would be no HinduMuslim riots, there would be no robbers or dacoits. Some might say that for such strength you need either a Jesus or a Buddha. But this is not so. Neither Jesus nor Buddha tried non-violence in the political sphere, or it would be truer to say that the present-day type of politics did not exist in their day. The Congress experiment is, therefore, a new one. The tragedy is that Congressmen have not tried it with full faith, full understanding and sincerity. If they had had these three essential qualities, the Congress would today have been far taller than it is. But I may not cry over spilt milk. I refer to the past only in order to guide us in the present. Even if we wake up now, the game is ours; if we do not, we shall surely lose. Power invariably elects to go into the hands of the strong. That strength may be physical or of the heart, or, if we do not fight shy of the word, of the spirit. Strength of the heart connotes soul force. If today we decide that we should try to get power by force of arms, we shall have to undo all the work of twenty years among the masses. We shall have to spend a considerable time in giving people a contrary training. We cannot afford to give the required time at this
 
 critical juncture. It is certain that today whoever has any strength of any kind will use it for seizing power. It is my firm conviction that, if Congressmen are to get power, it should only be through  non- violence or soul force.
 We have neither time nor material to do new work even in this line. When we have so far employed non-violence as a weapon of the weak, how can we all of a sudden expect to convert it into a weapon of the strong? But in spite of this I feel that at the present moment this experiment alone is feasible and proper for us. There is no risk involved in it. Even failure in it takes the form of success because, even if the people are not able to go the whole length in  the experiment, they cannot possibly be led into a ditch. By following the way of physical force they may not only be proved cowards, but in attempting to follow an untrodden path thousands may also be destroyed.
 It is then the duty of Congressmen to seek out dacoits and robbers. They should try to understand and convert them. Such workers cannot be had for the asking; but Congressmen should know that this work is just as important as it is fraught with risk, and a certain number of them have to devote themselves to it.
 The second thing requisite is that we should prepare such workers as would, under difficult circumstances, stand up to dacoits and, whilst trying to check or convert them from their evil ways, be prepared to suffer hurt or even death. Perhaps few workers will be forthcoming for this task too, but peace brigades throughout the country are a definite necessity. Or else in times of chaos Congressmen will lose all the reputation they have so far gainedlibtech_736_footnotelibtech_737_footnote.
 Thirdly, the rich should ponder well as to what is their duty today. They who employ mercenaries to guard their wealth may find those very guardians turning on them. The monied classes
 have got to learn how to fight either with arms or with  the  weapon of non-violence. For those who wish to follow the latter way the best and most effective  mantra is  :	—libtech_738_footnotelibtech_739_footnote(Enjoy thy wealth by renouncing it.) Expanded, it means : ‘Earn your crores by all means. But understand that your wealth is not yours; it belongs to the people. Take what you require for your legitimate needs, and use the remainder for society.’ This truth has hitherto not been acted upon; but, if the monied classes do not even act on it in these times of
 
 stress, they will remain the slaves of their riches and passions and consequently of those who overpower them.
 But I have visions that the end of this war will mean also the end of the rule of capital. I see coming the day of the rule of the poor, whether that rule be through force of arms or of non-violence. Let it be remembered thatlibtech_740_footnotephysical force is transitory even as the body is transitory. But the power of the spirit is permanent, even as the spirit is everlasting.

   QUESTION BOX  
 UNITARY METHOD
  You 	seem to be advocating 	what you call the 	unitary method 	in the solution 	of many 	questions. Will 	you explain it 	a little 	more fully 	than you have done? 
A.	It is as simple as it is sure. A contract or pact is between two
 parties. There is also consideration passing from one to the other. Such was the Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the Muslim League. The same thing could have been accomplished by the unitary method. Only then there would have been no compromise dictated by fear and distrust. The Congress could have done, according to its notion, absolute justice, i.e., yielded the maximum consistent with the welfare of the whole nation without the expectation of any conside- ration from the League. In a well-regulated family the relations are governed by the unitary method. Thus a father gives to his children not as a result of a pact. He gives out of love, a sense of justice without expecting any return therefor. Not that there is none. But everything is natural, nothing is forced. Nothing is done out of fear or distrust. What is true of a well-regulated family is equally true of a well- regulated society which is but an extended family. My advice about the adoption of two scripts by Hindus and Muslims is based on the unitary method. My equal love for all communities dictates its adop- tion. Properly applied, the method never fails. It disarms criticism and opposition. It presupposes a clean conscience and clean action. I pro- pose to unfold in these columns the application of the method in all our communal relations. The views will be personal to me, as are all such since the Bardoli Resolution. They will be addressed to Con- gressmen for adoption only in so far as they appeal to their reason.
 RAJAJI
 Q. What has come over Rajaji? You and he seem to be drifting away from each other.
 A. Yes, we seem to be and yet we are not. The seeming drift is but a prelude to a closer bond and clearer understanding. His loyalty is above suspicion. He would have gladly suppressed himself, if I had not strongly encouraged him to propound his views with a view to their adoption by the public. We owe allegiance to the same goddess. Our interpretations differ. If he is erring, he will retrace his steps as soon as he discovers it. And he knows that I would do likewise, if I
 discover mine. I feel, therefore, absolutely safe with him, and I ask all questioners to do likewise.
 UNTRUTH
 Q.  Do you know that you are reported to have said at Benares that it is sinful for any Indian ever to study or speak in English and you are charged with insincerity in that you make such liberal use of the hated language when it suits you?
 A.   The report is wholly untrue. But once an untruth gets a start  it is most difficult to overtake. Many untruths about me have had such a start. They created a temporary sensation and got a decent burial without any effort on my part. So will this one. No untruth has ever done any harm to anyone if there was no bottom to it. I am answering the question, not to protect my reputation but to carry my point further. The charge of insincerity is itself the best refutation of the untruth. For my free use of the English language is not a thing of today. The charge should have been regarded as unworthy of belief. Let it be known that I am a lover of the English language and the English. But my love is wise and intelligent. Therefore I give both the place they deserve. Thus I do not allow the English language to dis- place the mother tongue or the natural all-India language—Hindus- tani. Nor do I let my love of the English displace my fellow-country- men whose interest I can in no way allow to be injured. I recognize the great importance of the English language for international intercourse. I hold its knowledge as a second language to be indispen- sable for specified Indians who have to represent the  country’s  interest in the international domain. I regard the English language as an open window for peeping into Western thought and sciences. For this too I should set apart a class. Through them I would spread through the Indian languages the knowledge they have gained from the West. But I would not burden India’s children and sap their youthful energy by expecting the expansion of their brains through the medium of a foreign language. I do hold it to be a sin on the part of those who are responsible for producing the unnatural condition under which we are being educated. Such a thing is unknown in any other part of the world. Being too near the scene of the wreck we are unaware of the damage the nation has suffered by it. I can see the enormity of the damage because of my daily and close contact with the dumb and suppressed millions.
 ANOTHER UNTRUTH
 Q. You are reported by the Press to have approvingly referred to the progress made by the Japanese in adopting Western methods with a thoroughness hitherto unknown in the East. Is not this a contradiction of all you have written about the West? Or is there one law for India and another for Japan?
 
 A. This is another untruth like the one about the English language. The reader will find out for himself from Mahadev Desai’s report of my Benares speechlibtech_755_footnotelibtech_756_footnoteas to what I   actually  said  about  the Japanese. The burden of my speech was the undesirability of making English the medium of instruction and all-India speech. I said in this connection that, however harmful in my opinion the Japanese adaptation of the West was, the rapid progress was due to the restric- tion of the learning of the Western mode to a select few and using them for transmission of the new knowledge among the Japanese through their own mother tongue. Surely it is easy enough to under- stand that the Japanese could never have adapted themselves to the new mode, if they had had to do so through a foreign medium.

   TALK TO KHADI VIDYALAYA STUDENTSlibtech_757_footnote  
 SEVAGRAM,
 January 29, 1942 I have something to say about the manner in which you just  came and sat here.libtech_758_footnotelibtech_759_footnoteThe task before us is so great and pure that it
 should influence our manner of speech as well as movement, in fact all our actions as well as thoughts. When we assemble to hear someone we should sit in a decent posture, without being huddled together. And we should make it a point to sit up straight and erect and in an attentive posture. The way you are huddled together, one upon another, shows a lack of manners, of culture. Every tradition has its own definite style of deportment. In Western countries, people sit on chairs in a prescribed manner. The military training they receive also influences their style. We also have our own concept  of  good manners. But we have forgotten it. We have learnt nothing new from the West. That is why our plight is like Trishanku’slibtech_760_footnotelibtech_761_footnote, neither here nor there. We have our own code of postures, which helps make physical as well as spiritual progress. It is something we can offer the world provided we assimilate it in our lives. But we have now grown indo- lent. This is about the ancient Hindu tradition. The Arabs too have their own code of etiquette. They also have a graceful manner of sitting and rising. Their prayers too are offered in their  own prescribed style. In short, the only purpose of my saying all this is that whatever we do should have a method about it—a code to govern it. If you fulfil the expectations entertained about you, you can surpass the students of Government schools or colleges. In my view the importance of this Vidyalaya is not less but in fact more than that of a school or college. You are judged also by the way you lie and sit, by the manner and matter of your talk. Every action of a man from the cradle to the grave should be steeped in his culture. I would like to see your own culture in every one of your actions. It is not enough for you merely to learn spinning and weaving; it is only a means.
 Two things are most essential for man to subsist. One is food and the other clothing. There are three ways of solving the problem of food and clothing. One of them is to get them in the form of charity. But it is not proper. It does not mitigate the poverty of the people. On
 
 the contrary, it makes beggars of them. The other way is to take up employment and earn wages with which to subsist. This too makes us dependent. The third way is to arrange the production of food and clothing. This can be done in two ways. Either through spinning- wheels or through mechanized factories. By mass-producing the  goods we can certainly become self-dependent collectively, but not individually. In case of air-raids where will they drop the bombs if not on the workshops and factories? Certainly not on the [small] dwelling units where taklis and spinning-wheels are plying. If eventually we are left with no other means of producing cloth, we shall be obliged to depend on others for our needs. And if the factories are diverted to the manufacture of ammunitions, there will be no other means but the spinning-wheel left with us.
 All this can happen in future. If we can foresee it we should provide for it right from today. Today we need khadi worth one billion rupees, out of which we shall be able to produce at the most khadi worth one crore. It is no great achievement in my view. You are being trained here so that when you leave you may teach the people to produce their own requirements and stand on their own legs.
 Today if someone comes to me even after passing his M.A., I would ask him too what his ultimate aim in life was. What does he want to do? Employment of some sort, isn’t it? To secure employ- ment and earn his bread. But that is not your aim. If you come here to be trained so that you can earn your bread you cannot interest a man like me. Here is before you a course covering one year, not several as in the schools and colleges. The aim is to devise a scheme by which the whole of India, every single man in the country, can stand on his own feet. By producing cloth in the mills the money does not go to the poor but it moves from the poor man’s pocket into the rich man’s. On the other hand, if I buy khadi, I transfer some money to the poor and help them to be self-reliant. In this way if we succeed in making them self-reliant in one matter alone, they will themselves learn to be so in all other matters. Khadi is like the carpenter’s set square. When with its help he corrects one angle, the remaining angles stand corrected in consequence. In the same way, if we could establish khadi, many other things would take root without special effort on our part. As a result of the work we have done for khadi, many village industries have now been revived and the activities of the A. I. V. I. A. are gaining ground. If you look at khadi work from this angle, you will realize what splendid thing khadi is and consequently your work and its impact too will be equally splendid.
 Bear in mind that you are learning the way of filling the poor man’s pocket and not your family’s. If we fail to appreciate this point, we all shall have to repent in the end. You had better look out now, quit this work and take up another profession or employment.
 In this context, I have deliberately omitted to mention the country’s independence and politics, although they are all intercon- nected. If we could make the poor people of India self-reliant in necessaries, swaraj will be within our reach. In my view, that alone would be real swaraj, and nothing else. If you will go through Shri Rajendra Babu’s recent essay on constructive programme you will know what an important role khadi has in the struggle for indepen- dence.
 Those of you who are leaving today should understand that whatever they have learnt or done here during these four weeks is nothing more than superficial introduction. They must increase their knowledge. If you have not developed a scientific outlook, if you have not learnt to think the scientific way, you will not be able to develop whatever you have gained here, nor will you be able to fulfil the expectations entertained of you. Here you have been entrusted with a key to a store of knowledge and if you have learnt to use it, I trust you will draw from that store new things every day and enrich yourselves.
 A teacher who establishes rapport with the taught, becomes one with them, learns more from them than he teaches them. He who learns nothing from his disciples is, in my opinion, worthless. When- ever I talk with someone I learn from him. I take from him more than  I give him. In this way, a true teacher regards himself as a student of his students. If you will teach your pupils with this attitude, you will benefit much from them.
 In my opinion the late Maganlal Gandhi was such an ideal khadi worker. He proved his worth beyond my expectations. Even strugg- ling against the most formidable difficulties, he used to learn some- thing useful to him wherever he could. He was neither afraid nor tired of hardships. Till his death he engaged himself in learning more and more about khadi. I want you to follow in your life this ideal of Maganlal Gandhi. Remember, if on returning to your home provinces you do not develop the knowledge acquired here, you will lose very soon what you carry with you. If you want to develop your know- ledge, know that it can grow only by teaching it to the others. If you continue to be such progressive and brilliant workers you will, I am sure, grow from 13 to 130 in a very short time.
 So, I am placing a great burden on the teachers who are leaving this place today. Please carry it with you. From wherever you will go and work I expect to hear that you are honest gentlemen and devoted servants of the country.
If anyone wants to ask any question he may do so.
 Q.	What should a khadi worker do to guard himself against lethargy and
  pride?   GANDHIJI 	: He should spin regularly and 	attentively for eight 
  	hours every day without a break. If, while plying the wheel, he 	thinks only of service to Daridranarayana, pride will not be 	able to cast its shadow on him, and how can lethargy remain?  Q.	What 	should a 	khadi worker do 	in case his subordinates 	do not 	carry out 	his instructions? Should he punish them? Should he get angry? GANDHIJI 	: He should try to convert them through 	patience with-  	out losing his temper. It has been my experience that when I become 	angry, I fail to convince. Anger is an enemy of reason. That is why 	we should not lose temper. Similarly, we cannot also mete out 	punish- ment. If any punishment is necessary, we should ourselves 	undertake a fast. But if the interest of khadi work demands it, the 	person con- cerned can be relieved.  	[From Hindi]  Harijan 	Sevak, 15-2-1942

   MY SINCERITY  
 I have been asked which way my sympathy lies. From a purely humanitarian point of view, undoubtedly, it is all with England. I do not wish that the British should be defeated, nor do I wish the defeat of the Germans. There will be very little meaning and charm for us in the rest of the world if an entire people, to whichever nation they belong, remain downtrodden, humiliated and embittered. Will not bitterness in any one nation constitute seeds of a future war? Whatever it is, if the present war continues till the bitter end, civilization itself will be reduced to ashes in this conflagration. Let us pray that it will stop before it is too late. Still, can it stop so long as there is hatred in the hearts of men? If I have hatred for even one individual, will it not imperceptibly spread to all his countrymen? Of course, there is ample reason for condemning the German dictator. But if I wish that armies bid farewell to arms and refrain from bloodshed—since this is the only meaning and message of ahimsa—I should adhere to my con- viction and should have no hatred for any living human being. Although I am pained at his deeds, I can have no hatred even for Adolf Hitler.

   DHANUSH TAKLI  
 I think dhanush takli is going to play a big role in the constructive programme. Today I am not going to enter into the relative merits and demerits of  dhanush takli and the spinning-wheel. I am convinced that we cannot manufacture spinning-wheels by thousands. It requires plenty of money which we do not have. Nor can they be manufactured at every place. They are also hardly portable.
 It is not possible either to make good taklis at every place, nor can we spin fast with them.
 That leaves only the dhanush takli which can be made with little labour and less money. We can also spin fast with it.
 Therefore, I request all khadi workers to study the dhanush takli, learn to make it and popularize it.
 Manufacture of new spinning-wheels should be postponed for the time being. By all means make the best use of the existing ones. Those who can and wish to manufacture the spinning-wheels locally
 may do so. But in order to create an atmosphere for dhanush takli all the new spinners should be supplied with dhanush taklis only.
 All khadi workers should peruse from  Harijan my articlelibtech_765_footnoteon the subject.

   SPEECH AT ALL-INDIA GOSEVA SANGH CONFERENCElibtech_766_footnote  
 WARDHA,
 February 1, 1942
 Gandhiji with biting irony . . . cast . . . lurid light on the worship of the cow  as seen in the streets of Bombay.
 We catch her by the tail and sanctify our eyes with its sacred touch. We regard even her urine as sacred and full of medicinal value and drink it. Alas, the poor cow is innocent of all this worship, and so our worship is lost on her. It even scares her. When it scares her she answers our attentions with a kick; when she is not scared she suffers us. . . .
 All this is too true and those who claim to protect the cow betray a criminal ignorance of the real method of protecting her and her progeny. Those who claim to worship the cow cruelly ill-treat the bullocks. Chaunde Maharaj has been working at the problem assidu- ously for years, but whilst he accepts my facts and even argument, he says, ‘What about the public sentiment? They somehow want to save the cow from the butcher.’ But they go about the wrong way and succeed in defeating the very object they are trying to achieve. I do
 
 
 not say this in a carping spirit, but shocking ignorance and want of understanding of the essentials of the problem betrayed by most of the people who run our pinjrapoleslibtech_767_footnotedismay me.
 He referred in passing to the wrong way of protecting the cow from a Mussal- man wanting to slaughter her, and said that he would repeat ad nauseam that to quarrel with the Mussalman and to kill him in order to protect the cow was to instigate more slaughter.
 The whole milk and ghee trade is in the hands of the Hindus. But have we been able to ensure a supply of pure milk and ghee? The milk is adulterated, and even the water used for adulteration is not clean. The cruel and criminal process of  phookalibtech_768_footnoteis well known. The ghee sold in the market can often be described as poison rather than ghee. The butter we get from New Zealand, Australia or Denmark is guaranteed pure cow’s butter, but there is no guarantee about the butter or ghee available here. There is not a shop in Wardha, where some of us are keen on this problem, where one could go and buy a seer of cow’s ghee of guaranteed purity.libtech_769_footnote
 I therefore say that if I can really protect the cow by adopting proper ways and means, I would protect the rest of the animals. But it can be done only if we know the true science and economy of it. Only then shall we be able to  interest  Perinbehn  in  the  problem.libtech_770_footnotelibtech_771_footnoteI  am amazed at our partiality for buffalo’s milk and ghee. Our economics is short-sighted. We look at the immediate gain, but we do not realize that in the last analysis the cow is the more valuable animal. Cow’s butter (and ghee) has a naturally yellowish colour which indicates its superiority to buffalo’s butter (and ghee) in carotene. It has a flavour all its own. Foreign visitors who come to Sevagram go into raptures over the pure cow’s milk they get there. Buffalo’s milk and butter are almost unknown in Europe. It is only in India that one finds  a prejudice in favour of buffalo’s milk and ghee. This has spelt all but extinction of the cow, and that is why I say that, unless we put an
 
 exclusive emphasis on the cow, she cannot be saved. It is a tragedy that all the cows and buffaloes put together cannot give us enough milk for the 40 crores of our people. We ought to realize the value of the cow as a giver of milk and the mother of draught and agricultural cattle. And how far is one to pamper popular prejudices? A cow proves valuable even if she dies, if we would make use of the skin, the bone, the flesh, the entrails and so on. But the good Chaunde Maharaj wonders if people can be persuaded to believe that dead cow’s hide is sacred. Why not? I would not hesitate to go into my house with shoes made of dead cow’s hide, provided of course the shoes are clean. I should not hesitate to have my meal with such clean shoes on. I have to do all this in order to show that the cow is an asset and not a liability. Today in many places they bury dead cows or sell them away for a song. We despise the Harijans who eat carrion, but we forget that it is due to our own fault. If we treated the hide properly, if we knew the manurial value of the flesh, and the use of the bone and the entrails—which we are demonstrating at Nalwadi—there would be no carrion-eating.
 Ever since my return to India from South Africa I have been harping on the question of the reform of pinjrapoles.  Unless  we realize and define their proper functions, they are sure to remain the economic waste they are. Their proper function is to take care of dry, old and disabled cows, of which individual owners cannot possibly take care—certainly not in towns and cities. Their function is not that of a dairy—though they may run a separate dairy if they can—but the care of the old and the disabled animals, and to provide the raw material for a tannery. There should be a well-equipped tannery attached to every pinjrapoles. They should maintain the best stud- bulls and loan them out for public use, they should provide every facility for the humane and scientific castration of bulls to be turned into bullocks, and there should be instruction centres for the agricul- turist and the dairy farmer. Here is plenty of scope for our agricul- tural and dairy graduates who should receive additional training for the special work and then be attached to every one of our pinjrapoles. All the pinjrapoles should then be affiliated to our Association which should be the central institution for expert advice, collection and co- ordination of information and statistics, and so on. The Association has made it a rule to have as its members those who take the following pledge :
 I agree with the object and means of the Association.
 I promise to use cow’s milk and its products exclusively, except for medical purposes or under unavoidable circumstances or in the articles of food containing milk and its products in a negligible quantity. I will refrain from
 
 the use of the leather of slaughtered cows, bullocks and calves.
 I will donate a sum of rupee one or 2,000 yards of self-spun yarn to the Association every year.
 Do not magnify the so-called difficulties and the embarrassment you would cause to your hosts. You can go about with cow’s ghee wherever you go—as Kakasaheb does—or you can do without it. It will be good propaganda, and you may succeed in converting your hosts also. But duty is not always easy of performance. To run away from it is the opposite of manliness, opposite of humanity.libtech_772_footnote
 Answering a question, Gandhiji said that goseva formed part of the cons- tructive programme of the Congress.
 Mahatma Gandhi appealed to the audience to stabilize and organize pinjra-
 poles. Even Muslims could co-operate in this cow-protection and preservation work, as it would increase milch cattle, give nutrition and preserve a good supply of bullocks for cultivation.
 Unless you offer your full co-operation to Jamnalalji, especially on the question of pinjrapoles, his best efforts cannot succeed. Today the cow is on the brink of extinction, and I am not sure that our efforts will ultimately succeed. But if she dies, we also die along with her—we, i.e., our civilization. I mean our essentially non-violent and rural civilization. We have, therefore, to make our choice. We can choose to be violent and kill all uneconomic cattle. Like Europe we should then breed our cattle for the purposes of milk and meat. But our civilization is fundamentally different. Our life is wrapped up in our animals. Most of our villagers live with their animals, often under the same roof. Both live together, both starve together. Often enough the owner starves the poor cattle, exploits them, ill-treats them, unmercifully extracts work out of them. But if we reform our ways, we
 can both be saved. Otherwise we sink together, and it is just as well that we swim or sink together.
 The question today is to solve the problem of our starvation and poverty, but I have confined myself to the problem of the starvation and poverty of our cattle. Our rishislibtech_773_footnoteshowed us the sovereign remedy. ‘Protect the cow,’ they said, ‘and you protect all.’ We have to add to the talents they have left us, and not to waste them. We have invited the experts,libtech_774_footnotelibtech_775_footnoteand we shall make every use of their advice. Nothing that we laymen say is final, we shall get the experts to test it with their
 
 knowledge and experience. We shall, therefore, always seek their advice and invite their criticism.

   THREE ESSENTIALS  
 Assuming the presence of the will among the millions, rapid spread of hand-spinning is possible only by the adoption of the following three things :
  Use 	of unginned 	cotton from the nearest 	spot when it 	is not grown 	on one’s 	own plot.  Ginning 	it on 	a polished 	board with 	an iron or 	smooth wooden 	rod and carding 	the cotton 	by manipulation 	of the 	cotton with 	fingers assisted 	by a 	wooden knife 	made on 	 the  spot. 	 This process is called 	tunai (  ). Spinning 	the slivers 	on the dhanush takli. 
 Hand-gins cannot be manufactured to order today. All available unginned cotton should be prepared first by the method explained in 2 above.
 Where unginned cotton is not available ginned cotton from factories has got to be used. It too lends itself to tunai, though much more time is required for carding by the tunai process when bale cotton has to be used. Where a carding-bow is available, naturally it will be used. But what is true of ginning is equally true of carding. It is not possible to manufacture bows and gut in a moment. Tunai is a method devised and being perfected by Shri Vinoba with an artist’s skill and ardour.
 When spinning spreads among the millions it will be impossible to supply slivers from a centre or centres. The utmost that is possible is for families or groups to set apart one or two hands per a fixed number for carding. The ideal, the best, and in the long run the quickest, way is for each one to prepare his own slivers. It makes spinning more interesting, and the variety of occupation breaks the monotony.
 I suggest that, though the crisis is not yet felt and the mills are working, khadi workers will do well from now to  adopt  the suggestions I have made. When the crisis does come, we shall then be found ready.

 The writer has signed the letter, but as it is marked personal I refrain from giving his name. In any case the name does not matter. What the writer says is, I know, the belief held by many Muslims. My repudiation has not undone the mischief.
 But my articlelibtech_777_footnotewhich was written on the 23rd ultimo and has appeared in Harijan of the 1st instant, should soothe the writer so far as I am concerned.
 I entirely agree with my correspondent that all who want one all- India speech should today learn both the forms—Hindi and Urdu. Those who do will ultimately give us a common language. That form which is more popular and more understood by the masses, whether Hindu or Muslim, will surely be the all-India speech. But if my proposal finds general acceptance, the language question will cease to be a political issue or a bone of contention.
 I do not subscribe to the correspondent’s statement that Urdu is “more developed, more beautiful, more attractive, more concise, and more expressive”. No language is intrinsically all that the corres- pondent says. A language becomes what its speakers and writers make it. English had no merit apart from what Englishmen made it. In other words, a language is a human creation and takes the colour of its creators. Every language is capable of infinite expansion. Modern Bengali is what Bankimlibtech_778_footnoteand Rabindranath have made it. If, therefore, it is true that Urdu is more everything than Hindi, it is because its creators are abler than those of Hindi. I can give no opinion, for I have not studied either as a linguist. I know just enough of both for my public work.
 But is Urdu a language distinct from Hindi as, say, Bengali is from Marathi? Is not Urdu a direct descedant of Hindi, written in the Persian character with a tendency to borrow new words from Persian and Arabic rather than Sanskrit? If there was no estrangement between the two communities, such a phenomenon would have been
 
 welcomed. And when the animosities have died out, as they will one day, our descendants will laugh at our quarrels and will be proud of the common Hindustani speech which will be a mixture of words indifferently borrowed from many languages according to the tastes and equipment of its multitude of writers and speakers.
 Let me correct one misimpression of my correspondent. He seems to think that Hindustani will finally displace all the provincial languages. That is neither my dream nor of those who have been thinking of an all-India speech. Their dream is that Hindustani should displace English which has almost become a common medium of communication between the educated classes resulting in a gulf being created between them and the masses. The tragedy can be prevented only if the common speech spoken by the largest number of India’s inhabitants is adopted as the interprovincial speech. The fight, therefore, is not between Hindi and Urdu, but between the two on the one hand and English on the other. The result is a foregone  conclusion in spite of the heavy handicap that the sisters are labouring under, not to speak of the temporary mutual quarrel.
 My correspondent quarrels with my connection with the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. I am proud of my connection with that body. It has a record of which it has no reason to be ashamed. The name Hindi was common to both the communities. Both have written in Hindi and promoted its growth. Evidently my correspondent is ignorant of what my connection with that body has meant. It was under my instigation that it wisely, and shall I say patriotically and generously, adopted the definition of Hindi to cover Urdu. He asks whether I ever joined an Urdu Anjuman. I have never been seriously asked to join any. If I was, I would have made a stipulation with my inviters similar to the one I made with those who induced me to preside at the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. I would have asked the Urdu-speaking inviters to let me ask the audience to define Urdu so as to include Hindi speech written in Devanagari script. No such luck came my way.
 But now, as I have already hinted in my article of the 1st instant already referred to, I would like to form an association advocating the learning of both forms of speech and both the scripts by its members and carrying on propaganda to that end in the hope finally of a natural fusion of the two becoming a common interprovincial speech called Hindustani. Then the equation would be  not  Hindustani  = Hindi + Urdu, but Hindustani = Hindi = Urdu.

 742. THE ASHRAM PRAYERlibtech_779_footnote
 The Ashram prayer has become very popular. Its development has been spontaneous. The  Ashram Bhajanavalilibtech_780_footnotelibtech_781_footnote(Hymn Book) has gone into several editions and is increasingly in demand. The birth and growth of this prayer has not been artificial. There is a history attached to almost every shloka and every selected bhajan. The Bhajanavali contains among others bhajans from Muslim Sufis and Fakirs, from Guru Nanak, and from the Christian Hymnary. Every religion seems to have found a natural setting in the prayer book.
 Chinese, Burmese, Jews, Ceylonese, Muslims, Parsis, Europeans and Americans have all lived in the Ashram from time to time. In the same way two Japanese sadhus came to me in Maganwadi in 1935. One of them was with me till the other day when war broke out with Japan. He was an ideal inmate of our home in Sevagram. He took part in every activity with zest. I never heard of his  quarrelling with anyone. He was a silent worker. He learnt as much Hindi as he could. He was a strict observer of his vows. Every morning and evening he could be seen going round with his drum and heard chanting his mantra. The evening worship always commenced with his mantra
 While Sadhu Keshav was still with us, Bibi Raihana Tyabji also came to stay at Sevagram for a few days. I knew her to be a devout Muslim but was not aware, before the death of her illustrious father, of how well-versed she was in Koran Sharif. When that jewel of Gujarat, Tyabji Saheb, expired no sound of weeping broke the awful silence in his room. The latter echoed with Bibi Raihana’s sonorous recitation of verses from the Koran. Such as Abbas Tyabji Saheb cannot die. He is
 
 ever alive in the example of national service which he has left behind.libtech_782_footnoteBibi Raihana is an accomplished singer with an ample repertory of bhajans of all kinds. She used to sing daily as well as recite beautiful verses from the Koran. I asked her to teach some verses to any of the inmates who could learn them, and she gladly did so. Like so many who come here she had become one of us. Raihana went away when her visit was over, but she has left a fragrant reminder of herself. The well-known ‘al Fateha’ has been included in the Ashram worship. The following is a translation of it.
  I 		take refuge in 		Allah from Satan the accursed.  Say 		: He is God, 		the one and only 		God, the Eternal, Absolute,  
 He begetteth not nor is He begotten, And there is none like unto Him.
  Praise 		be to God,  
 The Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds, Most Gracious, most Merciful,
 Master of the Day of Judgment, Thee do we worship
 And Thine aid we seek. Show us the straight way, The way of those on whom
 Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace, Those whose (portion) is not wrath And who go not astray.
 I am writing this note in reply to an ardent Hindu friend who has thus gently reproached me : “You have now given the Kalma a place in the Ashram. What further remains to be done to kill your Hinduism?”
 I am confident that my Hinduism and that of the other Ashram Hindus has grown thereby. There should be in us an equal reverence for all religions. Badshah Khan, whenever he comes, joins in the worship here with delight. He loves the tune which the Ramayana is sung, and he listens intently to the Gita. His faith in Islam has not lessened thereby. Then why may I not listen to the Koran with equal reverence and adoration in my heart?
 
 Vinoba and Pyarelal studied Arabic and learnt the Koran in jail. Their Hinduism has been enriched by this study. I believe that Hindu- Muslim unity will come only through such spontaneous mingling of hearts and no other. Rama is not known by only a thousand names. His names are innumerable, and He is the same whether we call Him Allah, Khuda, Rahim, Razaak, the Bread-giver, or any name that  comes from the heart of a true devotee.

    LETTER TO JAMNALAL BAJAJlibtech_783_footnote   
 Unrevised	Silence Day, February 2, 1942
 CHI. JAMNALAL,
 Your question deserves to be considered. Does  the  Goseva Sangh belong to Hinduism or is it a public institution? If it is a public institution, then do all religions accept it, or will they? If it is not a sectarian body, then we should try to draw to it followers of all religions.
 Your list does not contain names of persons from different provinces; there is nothing like goseva in the South nor in Bengal and the Punjab. Is no one from these places to be included?
 Of late I have not come in contact with Chaunde Maharaj, but my experience of him is not quite encouraging. He has one or two workers who are good. My attitude is to accept from him whatever help he can give. He has his own institution. It should not be inter- fered with. We should learn from each other, and have a fraternal feeling.
 Yes, there ought to be a woman. By all means do  have Manibehn. It will be very difficult to get Rajkumari. At home it will not be possible for her to follow the rules about the cow. If you enlist supporters or friends, you can include persons like Rajkumari.
 I shall look into the accounts of the old Sangh.

    QUESTION BOX   
 HINDU-MUSLIM PUZZLE
 Q.  In your proposed solution of the Hindu-Muslim puzzlelibtech_784_footnote,  do you expect all the Hindus to abstain from the legislatures or only a part? If only a part, will not the most reactionary Hindus get in and make things worse than now? And if you expect Congressmen to affect the Muslim mind from outside, why can’t you do the same and perhaps more effectively by being inside?
 A. I do not expect all the Hindus to abstain. I know that all Hindu seats will be filled by non-Congress Hindus. Congress Hindus, if they go in, will be ground down between the two stones of the communal  chakkilibtech_785_footnotewithout doing any  good  to  anybody.  I  do  not approach the question as a Hindu. I approach it as a Congressman seeking to represent equally all communities. But for the artificial system introduced in the composition of the Indian legislatures, all the members would be representing not communities but their parties grouped according to their non-communal shibboleths. As one repre- senting all communities I would expect not only Hindus but Con- gress-minded Muslims and others too to avoid the legislatures and elective bodies. These abstainers will hold the scales evenly between all communities and seek to affect the legislatures from outside. Whether they are many or only a few, they will play the role of wise men. If all listened to me, the communal question would disappear from our midst. By entering the legislatures the Congress Hindus become inter- lopers, and act weakly for fear of offending one party or the other. This I know, that at the present moment the legislatures are, and must become, part of the war machinery. They have no choice. They will not be allowed to function, if they obstruct the war effort. How could the rulers whose sole occupation is to prosecute the war do otherwise?
 WHY NOT IN HINDU MAJORITY PROVINCES?
 Q. Why not advise Congressmen to withdraw from the provincial legisla- tures too where the Hindus are in a majority?
 A. Because I do not want the non-Muslim minority parties to act as if they were the majority and carry on the government in these provinces. It would be a false position to which the Congress would be
 
 a willing party, if the Congress members withdrew. In these provinces, therefore, abstention cannot solve the communal tangle, and will bring about an unintended and undesirable state of things.
 TORTURING THE LANGUAGE?
 Q.	Surely you are torturing the language when you use the world “unitary” in the place of ‘unilateral’.libtech_786_footnotelibtech_787_footnoteFor that is obviously what you mean.
A.	I must plead not guilty.‘Unilateral’ has a definite legal
 meaning which does not fit in with what I am struggling to convey. It is not onesidedness. It is no-sidedness. It has impartiality implied in it. But it is not the method of impartiality. It is something more. I represent a party, say, the Congress. For the solution of the problem I apply a method whereby I seek to affect those who are estranged from me. I am not merely impartial, because I may or may not please them. Impartiality has to be felt by the aggrieved party. I go the utmost length to placate the offended party, and trust my out-and-out pure conduct to affect them. I may not succeed at once. But if there is a real sense of justice in the method, it must succeed. For want of a better word I have called the method “unitary”. The dictionary meaning satisfies my test which I have imperfectly described here.

    DISCUSSION AT ALL-INDIA GOSEVA SANGH CONFERENCE libtech_789_footnote   
 February 3, 1942libtech_790_footnote
 Did Gandhiji mean to say that even as khadi saved the Indian mill-cloth, the protection of the cow would mean the protection of the buffalo?
 Gandhiji said :
 Yes, but I mean something more. I have often said that I should not shed a single tear, if all the mills were to be destroyed. I would never say this regarding the buffalo.
 Explaining the matter at greater length he said :
 No, my point is that, unless we protect the cow today, we will fail to save both the cow and the buffalo. And it is not possible to make a combined endeavour to save both. The combined endeavour will result in the buffalo devouring the cow. The cow is the more neg- lected animal, and that is why we should concentrate on the cow. But not even if Jamnalalji got a few crores of rupees can we achieve our object until we have converted the people to our view—especially the people who run goshalas and pinjrapoles.
 There is no question of ‘boycott’, much less of the killing of buffaloes. Slaughter is a thing that suggests itself easily to Western economists. That is why they cut the Gordian knot by slaughtering the inferior breed of cows and bulls. But that solution is not good for me. It is my firm conviction that, if we master the real science of saving the cow, the science of saving the buffalo and other animals would automatically be revealed to us.
 [Q.] But, supposing you were to boycott all the buffaloes in Sevagram, what would happen to them and their owners?
 I promise to take charge of the buffalo in case you succeed in your mission of the cow to that extent. If the mill-owners voluntarily
 
 close down the mills, I shall dance with joy, but not if the owners of the buffaloes were to slaughter them. Western economics is divorced from ethics; our ethics and economics coincide or should, if they do not. My exclusive emphasis on the protection of the cow is due to the undue neglect of the cow although she in my opinion is a sound economic proposition. I do not need the aid of the Vedas to show me this, and this is a matter in which I would test the Vedic precept on the anvil of reason. Reason convinces me that if I save the cow I save the cow and the buffalo both. If anyone can convince me that the cow is dead beyond redemption, and that the buffalo alone needs to be protected, I am quite prepared to organize a ‘Buffalo Protection Association’. But the reverse is the case. The buffalo needs no special protection, the cow needs it. The buffalo and the goat are as much my mothers as the cow. But I know that the poor goat cannot be saved, that the cow badly needs to be saved, and when we have saved the cow the buffalo will be automatically saved.libtech_791_footnote
 Gandhiji tentatively suggested that co-operative owning of cows and co- operative owning of pasture for them would go a great length in improving both the breed and the milk yield and in helping to solve the question of grazing.
 For the next year the Goseva Sangh should, suggested Gandhiji, concentrate on making cow’s milk available throughout Wardha and its neighbourhood, on sending experts to pinjrapoles in order to collect material, throw out suggestions, and help in making them approximate to the ideal pinjrapole contemplated by the Sangh, and on having a laboratory in Wardha for the testing of milk and ghee, and so on. The Sangh will also try to enlist at least a thousand members.

    TO CORRESPONDENTS   
 Correspondents will please note that I neither open nor read all the correspondence that comes to me. And now that I have taken up the care of the three weeklies, the fewest possible letters are put before me, and even those I often do not get the time to read. Correspondents should regard the weeklies as my public letter to them. Therefore they may not as a rule expect personal replies. Many apply for admission to the Sevagram Ashram. For one thing there is hardly room for further admissions. Some insist on replies in my own hand. It is not possible to satisfy this desire, much as I should like to. I  would therefore request all correspondents to spare me and my overworked assistants as much as possible.

Why should you become a coward after having spent two years? Hence, 	you must complete the term and gain whatever knowledge you can even 	if you are not appearing for the examination. Knowledge thus gained 	will never go waste. You must become proficient in physics, which is 	an interesting subject. And chemistry is a very useful

 Read both your letters. What you say is quite correct. Advance notice about [the arrival of] guests must be sent. But extraordinary situations will always arise. We should be prepared for that—whether as regards utensils or accommodation. If you have none, you should send word that the guests would be called in as soon as accommo- dation becomes available. If the food is not enough you will make do with whatever you have. If we have some we should serve it to the guests and ourselves go without any. This will be an emergency decision. If you do not get proper notice owing to carelessness, you will warn those responsible for the confusion. What more can we do?
 As for the plates, do this. Collect all the utensils. The new ones should be withdrawn. So many new utensils have come and still there is shortage ! What could be the reason?
 Collect all the spoons; they should be given to those who need
them.
 If you find any difficulty in doing either of these things, take

       NOTES     MISBEHAVIOUR 	OF TROOPS  	I have piteous letters from correspondents complaining of 	misbehaviour by troops, white and Indian. There are detailed letters 	from Dohad and Rutlam stations and others too. The troops are said 	to have molested the hawkers on the platforms, helped themselves to 	eatables and hit the salesmen who protested. The station-masters 	were powerless to afford protection. I do not know how much credit 	is to be attached to the descriptions I have received. The evidence 	is so detailed and given with so much moderation as to command 	belief. Anyway I draw the attention of the authorities to the 	complaints. Any such misbehaviour should be put down summarily and  	repetition  made practically impossible, If panic is to be prevented 	and bitterness avoided. I would advise the aggrieved parties to 	lodge their complaints to the proper authorities with authentic 	evidence in support.

 Some of the workers of the Hyderabad State Congress which was banned on 2nd March, 1940, offered individual satygraha in the month of September 1940.       The Government of H.E.H. the Nizam released them
 unconditionally on 16th December, 1941. Immediately after the release, I issued a statement saying.	that it was incumbent upon us to continue the
 satyagraha till our demend for lifting the ban was conceded by the Government. After our release we consulted Mahatmaji and.	he advised us to
 abstain from re-offering satyagraha at this hour, and directed us to concentrate our energies wholly on the constructive programme.	We therefore appeal
 to the people in general and workers in particular to devote their energies to this programme.	This suspension, however, does not mean any alteration
 in our goal which is the attainment of responsible government under the aegis of H.E.H. the Nizam and the Asafjahi Dynasty.
 How I wish the Government of H. E. H. the Nizam  would  remove the ban. They cannot wish to prevent people from carrying on a constitutional movement in favour of responsible government under the aegis of H. E. H. the Nizam. The recent release of the satyagrahis loses all grace if the ban on the State Congress is not removed.

    NOT NECESSARILY IMPURE   
Thus writes Shri Shankerrao Dev:
 In the last issue of Harijan, in your article “A Deplorable Incident”libtech_805_footnoteyou say to the rich: “Earn your crores by all means. But understand that your wealth  is not yours; it belongs to the people. Take what you require for  your  legitimate needs, and use the remainder for society.” When I read this, the first question that arose in my mind was: ‘Why first earn crores and then use them for society?’ As society today is constituted the means of earning crores are bound to be impure; and one who earns crores by impure means cannot be expected to follow the mantra   — because in the very process of earning crores by impure means the man’s character is bound to be tainted or vitiated. And moreover you have always been emphasizing the purity of means. But I am afraid that there is a possibility of people misunderstanding that you are laying an emphasis here more on the ends than on the means.
 I request you to emphasize as much, if not more, on the purity of means of earning money as on spending. If purity of means is strictly observed, then, according to me, crores could not be accumulated at all and the difficulty of
 
 spending for society will assume a very minor prospect.
 I must demur. Surely a man may conceivable make crores through strictly pure means, assuming that a man may legitimately possess riches. For the purpose of my argument, I have assumed that private possession itself is not held to be impure. If I own a mining lease and I tumble upon a diamond of rare value, I may suddenly find myself a millionaire without being held guilty of having used impure means. This actually happened when Cullinan diamond, much more valuable than the Kohinoor, was found. Such instances can be easily multiplied. My argument was surely addressed to such men. I have no hesitation in endorsing the proposition that generally rich men and for that matter most men are not particular as to the way they make money. In the application of the method of non-violence one must believe in the possibility of every person, however depraved, being reformed under humane and skilled treatment. We must appeal to the good in human beings and expect response. Is it not conducive to the well-being of society that every member uses all his talents, only not for personal aggrandisement but for the good of all? We do not want to produce dead equality where every person becomes or is rendered incapable of using his ability to the utmost possible extent. Such a society must ultimately perish. I therefore suggest that my advice that monied men may earn their crores (honestly only, of course) but so as to dedicate them to the service of all is perfectly sound   
— is a mantra based on uncommon knowledge. It is the surest
 method to evolve a new order or life of universal benefit in the place of the present one where each one lives for himself without regard to what happens to his neighbour.

    INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE? libtech_806_footnote   
 Shri Jamnalal Bajaj has bravely taken the burden of the great work of cow service (in other words, cattle preservation) on his shoulders. The most important question for consideration before the recent Goseva Sangh Conferencelibtech_807_footnotewas whether cow-farming should be in the hands of individuals or done collectively. I myself had no hesitaton in saying that she could never be saved by individual
 
 farming. Her salvation, and with her that of the buffalo, could only be brought about by collective endeavour. It is quite impossible for an individual farmer to look after the welfare of his cattle in his own home in a proper and scientific manner. Amongst other causes lack of collective effort has been a principal cause of the deterioration of the cow and hence of cattle in general.libtech_808_footnote
 The world today is moving towards the ideal of collective or co- operative effort in every department of life. Much in this line has been and is being accomplished. It has come into our country also, but in such a distorted form that our poor have not been able to reap its benefits. Pari passu with the increase in our popultion land-holdings of the average farmer are daily decreasing. Moreover, what the individual possesses is often fragmentary.libtech_809_footnoteFor such farmers to keep cattle in their homes is a suicidal policy; and yet this is their condition today. Those who give the first place to economics and pay scant attention to religious, ethical or humanitarian considerations proclaim from the house-tops that the farmer is being devoured by his cattle due to the cost of their feed which is out of all proporation to what they yield. They say it is folly not to slaughter wholesale all useless animals.
 What then should be done by humanitarians is the question. The answer obviously is to find a way whereby we may not only save the lives of our cattle but also see that do not become a burden. I am sure that co-operative effort can help us in a large measure.
The following comparison may be helpful:
  Under 	the collective 	system no farmer 	can keep cattle 	in his 	house as 	he does today. 	They foul the air and 	dirty the surroundings. There is 	neither intelligence 	nor humanitarianism 	in living with animals. 	Man was not meant 	to do so. The space 	taken up by the cattle 	today would be 	spared to 	the farmer 	and his family 	if the 	collective system 	were adopted.  As 	the number 	of cattle 	increases, life 	becomes impossible 	for the farmer 	in his 	home. Hence he is 	obliged to 	sell the calves 	and kill the male buffaloes 	or else 	turn them out to starve 	and die. This inhumanity would be averted, if the care of cattle were undertaken on 
 
 a co-operative basis.
  Collective 	cattle-farming would 	ensure the 	supply of 	veterinary treatment to 	animals when 	they are ill. No 	ordinary farmer 	can afford 	this on his own.  Similarly 	one selected 	bull can be 	easily kept for 	the need of 	several cows under the 	collective system. This 	is impossible 	otherwise except for charity.  Common 	grazing ground or land 	for exercising the 	animals will 	be easily 	available under the 	co-operative system, 	whereas today generally 	there is nothing 	of the 	kind for individual farmers.  The 	expense on 	fodder will 	be comparatively 	far less under 	the collective system.  The 	sale of milk 	at good 	prices will 	be greatly 	facilitated, and there 	will be no need 	or temptation 	for the farmer 	to adulterate 	it as 	he does as 	an individual.  It 	is impossible to 	carry out 	tests of 	the fitness 	of every 	head of 	cattle individually, but 	this could easily be 	done for the cattle 	of a 	whole village and would thus make it easier to improve the breed.  The 	foregoing advantages 	should be sufficient 	argument in favour 	of co-operative 	cattle-farming. The 	strongest argument in 	its favour 	is that 	the individualistic 	system has been 	the means 	of making 	our own condition as 	well as 	that of 	our cattle 	pitiable. We 	can only 	save ourselves and 	them by 	making this essential change. 
 I firmly believe too that we shall not derive the full benefits of agriculture until we take to co-operative farming. Does it not stand to reason that it is far better for a hundred families in a  village  to cultivate their lands collectively and divide the income therefrom than to divide the land anyhow into a hundred portions? And what applies to land applies equally to cattle.
 It is quite another matter that it may be difficult to convert people to adopt this way of life straightaway. The straight and narrow road is always hard to traverse. Every step in the programme of cow- service is strewn with thorny problems. But only by surmounting difficulties can we hope to make the path easier. My purpose for the time being is to show the great superiority of collective cattle farming over the individual effort. I hold further that the latter is wrong and the former only is right. In reality even the individual can only safeguard his independence through co-operation. In cattle-farming the individual effort has led to selfishness and inhumanity, whereas the
 collective effort can abate both the evils, if it does not remove them altogether.

764. LETTER TO LORD LINLITHGOW
 SEVAGRAM, WARDHA,
 February 8, 1942
 DEAR LORD LINLITHGOW,
 As I have suspended civil disobedience, I make bold to write this letter for humanity’s cause.
 The statutory law says that charitable institutions, though they make profits, are free from income-tax. I am the founder and Presi- dent of the All-India Spinners’ Association. I can give you my word that it is a purely charitable association. It exists to serve the poorest in the land through hand-spinning and hand-weaving. But simply through legal quibbles, disbelief of the evidence tendered and, I apprehend, for its connection with the Congress in that it  got  its charter from the Congress, the officials have decided do levy the income-tax. The profit are not denied but they have never been used for private or personal gain. The whole of the Executive of the Association is honorary. The Association has gone to the High Court of Bombay which has thrown out its petition on a legal flaw. It is appealing to the Privy Council. I do not know what will be the result. Meanwhile the Association has already paid a certain amount of the tax and is likely to be called upon to pay up to five lacs. They will not stay the levy pending the proceedings. But my request is for you to intervene and save the five lacs for the poor. Let me tell you that during the past 20 years of its existence the Association has distri-
 buted among the poor nearly four crores as wages.
 I am not burdening you with further facts or any papers. You can have these for the asking.
 You will forgive me for inflicting this on you when every moment of yours is pre-mortgaged for winning the war. Though I cannot sympathize with your enterprise, much less help in the manner you would wish, you will believe me when I say that I am as much today a friend of your people as I ever have been. Hence I understand what a strain it must be for you and Lady Linlithgow.
 When you write to Lady Annelibtech_810_footnoteand Southbylibtech_811_footnoteplease send my love to them. I have purposely refrained from acknowledging their letters in answer to my congratulations. I hope they with the baby are faring well.
       The 	Transfer of Power, Vol. 	I, pp. 135-6  I 	am,  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI 
   765. 	LETTER TO JAIRAMDAS DOULATRAM  SEVAGRAM, 	WARDHA, C.P.,  February 	8, 1942  MY 	DEAR JAIRAMDAS,  	The thorny crown that I wanted to put upon your head has come upon 	me. The Executive won’t have you or anybody else but me. They want 	the same man for the sun and the planets.  	But you must be in the A.I.V.I.A. as also in the A.I.S.A. if you are 	not in the latter.  	Hope you are flourishing and following what I write in Harijan. I 	wish you, Devilibtech_812_footnotelibtech_813_footnoteand   Premilibtech_814_footnotelibtech_815_footnotewill 	 make  up  your  Hindi  and  Urdu. How high would Premi have gone if 	she had given one quarter  	of the years to Hindi and Urdu just as she has given to English. The 	knowledge then gained would have flown to the masses. Now it is 	dammed and damned too. Love.

 CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE’S RESOLUTIONlibtech_816_footnote
 December 30, 1941
 The Working Committee have received the following letter from Gandhiji and recognize the validity of the point he has raised and therefore relieve him of the responsibility laid upon him by the Bombay Resolution referred to by Gandhiji. But the Committee assure him that the policy of non-violence adopted under his guidance for the attainment of swaraj and which has proved so successful in leading to mass awakening and otherwise will be adhered to by the Congress.  The  Working Committee further assure him that it would like to extend its scope as far as possible even in free India. The Committee hope that Congressmen will render him full assistance in the prosecution of his mission, including the offering of civil disobedience.

 APPENDIX II
 CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE’S RESOLUTIONlibtech_817_footnote
 December 30, 1941
 Fourteen months have elapsed since the Working Committee held their last meeting and during this period the world has fallen ever deeper into the abyss of war and rushed headlong towards self-destruction. The members of the Committee have met again on their release from prison and given earnest thought to all the national and international developments during this fateful period of human history. The burden of guiding the Congress and the nation at this critical stage, when old problems assume a new significance and war approaches the frontiers of India bringing new problems in its train, is a heavy one which the Committtee can only shoulder worthily with the full co-operation of the people of India. The Committee have endeavoured to keep in view the principles and objectives for which the Congress has stood during these past many years and considered them in the larger context of world conditions and world freedom. The Committee are convinced that full

 freedom for the people of India is essential even, and more especially, in the present state of world turmoil, not only for India’s sake but for the sake of the world. The Committee also hold that real peace and freedom can only be established and endured on the basis of world co-operation between free nations.
 The Committee gave full expression to their attitude towards the war in their statement issued on September 14, 1939,libtech_818_footnotewherein they condemned Nazi and Fascist aggression and expressed their willingness to help the cause of freedom and democracy, provided the objectives of the war were clearly stated and acted upon, in so far as was possible, in the present. If freedom and democracy were  those objectives, then they must necessarily include the ending of imperialism and the recognition of the independence of India. Subsequent pronouncements made on behalf of the British Government and their reactionary and oppressive policy made it clear that this Government was determined to maintain and intensify its imperialist hold and exploitation of the Indian people. British policy was one of deliberate insult to Indian nationalism of a perpetuation of unrestrained authoritarianism and the encouragement of disruptive and reactionary elements. Not only has every offer made by the Congress for an honourable compromise been rejected, but public opinion voiced by organizations regarded as moderate has also been flouted.
 The Congress was, therefore, compelled, in order to defend the honour and the elementary rights of the Indian people and the integrity of the nationalist movement, to request Gandhiji to guide the Congress in the action that should be taken. Mahatma Gandhi desirous of avoiding embarrassment to his opponent as far as possible, especially during the perils and dangers of war, limited the satyagraha movement which he started to selected individuals who conformed to certain tests he had laid down. That satyagraha has now proceeded for over fourteen months and about twenty- five thousand Congressmen have suffered imprisonment, while many thousands of others who offered satyagraha in the Frontier Province and elsewhere were not arrested. The committee desire to express their respectful appreciation of Gandhiji’s leadership and of the response of the nation to it, and are of opinion that this has strengthened the people.
 Throughout this period the attitude of the British Government has been hostile to Indian freedom and it has functioned in India as a completely authoritarian government, insulting the deeply cherished convictions and feelings of the people. Neither the professions of freedom and democracy nor the perils and catastrophes that have come in the wake of war have affected this attitude and policy, and such changes as have taken place have been for the worse.
 The recent release of a number of political prisoners has no significance or importance, and the circumstances attending it, and official pronouncements made,
 
 make it clear that it is not connected with any change of policy. Large numbers of detenus, who are kept in prison under the Defence of India Act without trial, and whose only offence seems to be that they are ardent patriots impatient of foreign rule and determined to achieve the independence of the country, still remain in prison. Recent arrests of prominent persons and their treatment in prison also indicate that the old policy is being pursued as before.
 While there has been no change in Britain’s policy towards  India,  the  Working Committee must nevertheless take into full consideration the new world situation that has arisen by the development of the war into a world conflict and its approach to India. The sympathies of the Congress must inevitably lie with the people who are the subject of aggression and who are fighting for their freedom. But only a free and independent India can be in a position to undertake the defence of the country on a national basis and be of help in the furtherance of the larger causes that are emerging from the storm of war. The whole background in India is one of hostility and of distrust of the British Government and not even  the  most  far-reaching promises can alter this background, nor can a subject India offer voluntary or willing help to an arrogant imperialism which is indistinguishable from Fascist authoritarianism.
 The Committee is, therefore, of opinion that the resolutionlibtech_819_footnoteof the A. I. C. C. passed in Bombay on September 16, 1940, holds today and defines Congress policy still.

 APPENDIX III
 CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE’S INSTRUCTIONSlibtech_820_footnote
 This meeting of the A. I. C. C. endorses the following instructions issued by the Working Committee and calls upon all Provincial and other subordinate Congress Committees to give effect to them within their respective areas. The Provincial Congress Committees are authorized to supplement them wherever necessary. The Committee expects every member of an elective Congress Committee to devote himself actively to the execution of some item of this programme, and to send periodical reports of the work done by him to his Committee :
 Recent developments in the world situation have brought war near to India’s frontiers. This may lead to internal dislocation in certain parts of the country and
 
 there is a possibility of some cities being subjected to aerial attack. Whatever dangers and difficulties might arise, the real antidote to them is to remain cool and collected and on no account to give way to nervousness and excitements. Congressmen must remain at their posts and continue their service of the people; wherever necessity arises they should yield places of safety to those in greater need and be ready to render aid to those who may require it.
 The Congress can help and serve the people in the difficult times ahead only if its organization is strong and disciplined and Congressmen  individually  and Congress Committees are able to command confidence in their respective localities. Congress Committees and Congressmen should therefore address themselves immediately to the task of strengthening the organization and reviving and maintaining contacts with the people in the villages and towns. Every village should, as far as possible, receive the message of the Congress and be prepared to face such difficulties as might arise.
 The constructive programme adopted by the Congress, and explained from time to time by Gandhiji, is of particular importance at this juncture. It is meant not only to bring about unity among various groups, to remove disabilities which keep sections of the community backward and depressed, to promote self-reliance and the co-operative spirit among the people, to increase production and have fairer distribution but it also furnishes the best opportunity and means of contacts with the people and service to them which are necessary for winning their confidence. The Working Committee therefore call upon Congress Committees and workers to further this programme intensively, and thus exercise a steadying and strengthening influence in times of dislocation and uneasiness.
 During such times there is always a possibility of trouble being created by un- social elements in the country. To avoid the emergence of such a situation and to meet  it when it arises, volunteers should be organized in both the urban and rural areas. Such organizations should be formed on the basis of strict non-violence, and it should always be remembered that the Congress adheres to this principle. These volunteers may co-operate with other organizations working for other ends, this volunteer organization is meant for rendering service to the people both normally and in the event of possible internal commotion. It should therefore avoid conflict with the authorities.
 Prices of commodities have already risen and are causing distress among the people and no adequate steps have so far been taken by the authorities to meet this situation. These tendencies are likely to be accentuated in the future, and dislocation
 
 of trade and transport, due to stress of war, may lead to scarcity of the necessaries of life as well as of many other things which are of everyday use. Big-scale industries in other countries have suffered heavily on account of the war, and transport of goods has become difficult on account of military requirements. China has largely overcome these difficulties by a widespread development of village industries. India may have to face similar problems, and village and cottage industries afford a solution, desirable in itself, and more particularly, suited to the needs of the moment. Such industries can escape to a large extent the effects of dislocation of trade and transport. It is therefore necessary that this item of the constructive programme should be widely taken up and worked up with vigour and earnestness so that the countryside may be rendered, as far as possible, self-sufficient in regard to the necessaries of life. The Committee would specially recommend to the villagers the growing of food crops at least to cover the needs of the village and appeal to the grain dealers not to hold up stores for profit but release them for consumption at fair prices.
 In cases of emergency, when instructions are issued to the public by the authorities for the preservation of life and property and the maintenance of public order, Congressmen should avoid conflict with the authorities. They should carry out such instructions, unless they are contrary to Congress directions.
