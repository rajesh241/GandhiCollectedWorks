Regarding its recommendations, according to Mahadev Desai, Gandhiji said: “The Committee has done well in so far as it has come forward with a definition of untouchability and calculated the number of ‘untouchables’ so called at three crores and a half instead of the usual seven crores. For this Lothian is perhaps entitled to credit. Thanks to this definition, Hindus, if they wish, can incorporate ‘untouchables’ into Hindu society in one moment and at a stroke satisfy all the demands ostensibly made on their behalf.” (Mahatma, Vol. III, p. 197; India in 1931- 32., pp. 50-1 and The Diary of Mahadev Desai, Vol. p. 147)"

Instead of that, please let it go in the form in which I have 	written it. As a matter of fact this is an issue on which you ought 	to resign—if you had any self-respect.

The scheme 	fixed the number 	of seats 	in the provincial 	legislatures and 	retained separate 	electorates for the 	minority communities and 	for the Muslims both 	in Bengal 	and the Punjab, 	despite their numerical 	majority.

The 	Depressed Classes were 	recognized as a minority 	community entitled to 	separate electorate. 	While creating 	a number of specially 	reserved constituencies 	for the Depressed 	Classes, it gave 	them the additional 	right to contest 	seats in 	the general 	constituencies, with 	this provision 	 that special electorates 	and reservation 	would lapse automatically after twenty years."
