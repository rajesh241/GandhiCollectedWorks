To a  satyagrahi, imprisonment is a civil death. But as a prisoner he can give authoritative instructions for prospective satyagrahi prisoners.

libtech_303_footnote,"120 and 125; if, however, he has kept up his strength, he will regain that level after he is released. He should guard against any disease insidiously attacking him. The reading which he has done is quite good, but in order to derive the fullest benefit from his work  he should carry out my suggestions as far as possible. Really speaking, however, when he has the benefit of the company of a person like Nanabhai1 , and will now have  the  benefit  of  Mahadev’s  company, there should hardly be any need for me to guide him. The reading he is doing at present is good indeed. There is little in it, however, to be remembered and digested. The reading which I have suggested will, while developing his memory and power of thinking, also beinteresting to him.  Jivanshodhan2    can be understood only if it is read carefully twice or thrice. He is doing right in reading it once again. One reason why my writings are easy to follow is that these days I write with the sole aim of making myself easily understood by all the inmates of the Ashram. Formerly too I wrote with the general public in view, and not for men of learning. It is natural, therefore, that my writings should be easy to understand. Let him write to me again. He should write as often as he gets time and is permitted to do so."
