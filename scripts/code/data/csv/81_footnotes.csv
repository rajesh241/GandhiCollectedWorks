No matter how the Bombay Resolution was interpreted, were we clear about certain fundamentals? Were we clear that the policy of non- violence that we had followed, to the best of our ability, for twenty years was no religious creed or for no religious purpose, but a wholly political method for the achievement of the political independence of India? Gandhiji had no doubt on the question. The next question was—could we at this critical hour in our nation’s history give up that policy even for the sake of proffered freedom?”"

Since then, in spite of his absence, our morning and evening worship has commenced with the mantra. For me it is a constant reminder of Sadhu Keshav’s purity and single-eyed devotion.
