1,,ROYAL ASSENT,
2,,TYRANNY OF LAW,"
     	The long-deferred Royal assent to the Registration Act has now been 	gazetted. General Botha, although he has assured Lord Elgin that he 	will consult the feelings of British Indians, has refused to receive 	a deputation of British Indians, saying that no good purpose could 	be served by receiving it as the Act was to be gazetted last week; 	but we notice that, although the Act is gazetted, the date of its 	enforcement has been indefinitely postponed. It may be fixed now or 	never. The letterlibtech_1_footnotelibtech_2_footnoteof  Mr.  Essop  Mia,  Acting   Chairman   of   the   	British   Indian Association, published in The Star and taken over 	by us, is, therefore, most timely. Mr. Essop Mia, who is a merchant 	of long standing, with very large interests at stake, tells the 	public that he feels  the  degradation of the Act so keenly, that he 	is prepared to sacrifice all, if that is the price he has to pay for 	non-submission to the Act. He then makes the most reasonable 	proposals, that the day for enforcing the Act may not be fixed for 	the time being, and that British Indians: and other Asiatics, in 	order to prove their bona fides, should be allowedto 	be voluntarily re-registered. If the experiment prove a failure, the 	Act shall be applied to those who have not adopted voluntary 	re-registration. We hope that the Transvaal Government will accept 	such an eminently reasonable suggestion. General Botha, in the name 	of the people of the Transvaal, more than once expressed profound 	gratitude to the Imperial Government for the liberal constitution 	granted to the Transvaal, and his concern for the Empire as a whole. 	If he includes India as a part of the Empire, there is reason to 	hope that he will, even at the last moment, by accepting the Indian 	compromise, avoid an exacerbation of the feelings of the British 	Indians in the Transvaal.  Indian 	Opinion, 15-6-1907       	He who will ferry others across to the shore, Will also take his 	boat to the port.  	He who will let others go to the bottom, Shall himself flounder.  	No good to wield the sword or the axe, The gun, the knife or the 	arrow,      
 For you will but reap what you sow.
 So sings the poet. “Reap as you sow” is a proverb known throughout the world. The principle of this proverb will not change for the benefit of the Indian community. A creeper yielding bitter fruit will never bear jasmines and the palasha will not yield mangoes. Likewise, it will never be that the Transvaal Indian community sows one thing and reaps another. It is only when the community proves its manliness that we shall be able to live like men. The community will enjoy respect if it deserves it. It will add to its honour if it keeps its word and fulfils what it has undertaken. If, on the other hand, the community forsakes its oath out of selfishness or fear or any other reason, it is certain that the rights of Indians in the Transvaal will be lost and that other Indians also will be crushed along with those in the Transvaal. So great is the task the Indian community in the Transvaal has undertaken.
 The poet adds that it is also the law of the world, or nature, or God, that he who takes others safely across will himself reach the other shore. Likewise, if we serve others, our own needs will be provided for. As for looking after oneself, even birds and beasts do this. The chief difference between man and beast is that man is a benevolent creature. All live happily where one feels happy in the happiness of others. But where everyone looks after himself alone, all are lost. For, as the poet says, “He who will let others go to the bottom, shall  himself flounder.” This is an important idea and a little  reflection  will showthat it is true. A mother suffers discomfort to bring up her child. In the end such a mother finds herself happy. Where the members of a family share one another’s burdens and give up individual interests, the whole family is well sustained. Members of a community individually suffer to save the group as a whole and are themselves saved too. Similarly, where men undergo suffering or die for their country’s sake, they truly live and bring credit to the country. Is there any Indian who seeks happiness for himself by breaking this fundamental law? These examples clearly prove that the Transvaal Indians will be victorious if, for the sake of the Indian community and for the sake of their personal honour, they endure all sufferings and face all hardships to accomplish the task they have undertaken. They will then break their bonds and win immortal fame in history.

3,,RHODESIA AND THE TRANSVAAL,"
  
 It has been argued in the Rhodesian Assembly that, since a law has been passed in the Transvaal for Asiatics, a similar law should be passed in Rhodesia too to prevent further Indian immigration and to provide for the registration of those already there. All members spoke on the subject in strong terms. A full account of it appears in our English section. It can be seen from this that, if the Transvaal law remains on the Statute-book and if the Indian community submits to it, its example will be followed everywhere else. There is but one way now to help the Indians in Rhodesia, and that is for the Transvaal Indians to show their mettle.

4,,INDENTURED INDIAN LABOURERS,"
  
 At Thornville junction, a European cruelly beat up an Indian and the latter died. The European was prosecuted and fined £10. We publish this report in full elsewhere. This is a blood-curdling case. The Indian lost his life, but the European got off with a fine of £10. There is nothing in it to comfort us. But we are not to think of revenge. The European will have to answer to the Creator. Had he been punished with hard labour, that would not have restored life to the Indian and would not have saved other indentured labourers from getting similar treatment in future.
 If we are to cure a disease, its cause must first be ascertained. Accordingly, if we look for the cause of this state of affairs, we shall find that indentured labour itself is an evil thing. If the system of indentured labour is put an end to, the kind of oppression described above will also stop. For in ordinary service one is not bound, as the indentured labourer is: if the service does not suit him, he is free to give it up.
 Mr. Robinson has stated in his speech that the importation of Indians as indentured labourers must cease. We also hold the same view. It is necessary for the [Natal Indian] Congress to take steps towards that end. That Mr. Robinson’s reasons and ours for ending the system of indentured labour are not the same is of no account.

5,,“THE WISDOM OF THE EAST”,"
  
 JALALUDDIN RUMIlibtech_3_footnote
 We have received for review two volumes of a series entitled The Wisdom of the East being published in Britain. The first is called The Way of the Buddha and the second, Persian Mystics, in which the author has assigned the first place to Jalaluddin Rumi. An informative account of Sufis is followed by a narrative of the life of Jalaluddin and translations of some of his poems. In the author’s view, a Sufi is a lover of God. Above everything else, the Sufis aspire after a pure heart and love of God. Jalaluddin was once observed dancing with joy at a funeral, and on being questioned what he meant thereby, the saint replied, “When the human spirit, after years of imprisonment in the cage and dungeon of the body, is at length set free and wings its flight to the source whence it came, is it not an occasion for rejoicing?” We can see that, in the olden days, even women freely participated in such [Sufi way of] life. Rabia Bibi was a Sufi herself. When asked if she hated the devil, she retorted that “her love of God left her no time to hate anyone”. According to the Sufi point of view, no religion based on morality can be considered to be false. In reply to a question Jalaluddin said, “The ways of God are as many as the number of souls of men.” Elsewhere he says, “God’s light is one but its rays are various in hue. We can worship God along any path, provided it
be with a true and sincere heart.”
 Referring to the nature of true knowledge, Jalaluddin says that “a blood-stain can be washed away with water, but the stain of ignorance can be washed clean only with the water of God’s grace”. And then again, “True knowledge is the knowledge of God.” Whenasked where one could find God, the poet replied, “I saw the Cross and also Christians, but I did not find God on the Cross. I went to find Him in the temple, but in vain. I saw Him neither in Herat nor in Kandahar. He could be found neither on the hill nor in the cave. At last, I looked into my heart and found Him there, only there and nowhere else.” This is an excellent book to read. We can endlessly go on quoting passages such as those above. We should like to recommend the book to everyone. It will be of profit to all, Hindus and Muslims alike. It costs two shillings in Britain. The same firm has also published Gulistan of Sheikh Saadilibtech_4_footnotelibtech_5_footnote, priced at 1s. Then there is a
 
 book entitled The Essence of the Koran, costing ls. The Way of the Buddha is priced at 2s and The Way of Zoroaster also at 2s. Other books are to follow. If any of our readers wants one or more of these books, he should send us the amount of the price quoted above, and an extra 6d for every book. We shall procure the book for him. The extra 6d is for postage.

6,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
  
 NEW LAW
 General Botha has, as the saying goes, dug up a mountain to kill a mouse. He has informed the Association that no good  purpose would be served by receiving deputation, since all preparations had been made to bring the law into effect. Everybody therefore got busy looking into the Gazette, watching for the date when the law would come into force and other particulars. But nothing of the kind was found in the Gazette. It only says that the law has received the assent of His Majesty. There is nothing new in this. Another piece of information the Gazette gives is that the date on which the Act will be brought into effect will be fixed later. What does this mean ? The only construction I can put upon it is that the Government has been set thinking as to what it should do to meet the gaol resolution of the Indian community and how to implement the provisions of the Act. This may or may not be the right meaning, but one thing is certain, namely, that the gaol resolution has posed a problem for the Government.
 SOME QUESTIONS
 Thus, things are still unsettled. The Indian community will do well to keep its weapons ready. Questions are still being asked, which is a good sign. One of them is:
 IF OUR WELL-WISHERS IN ENGLAND DISAPPROVE GAOL-GOING?
 This is a good question. The answer, too, is straight. The members’ of the Committee or other gentlemen in England should be regarded as our well-wishers as long as they help us in preserving our self-respect and our rights. We may respect their views. But when their views go against our rights, we are not bound by them. Suppose someone compels us to become Christians. We shall oppose him. If those whom we considered till now our well-wishers advise us to embrace Christianity, I am sure that every Hindu and every Muslim
 will agree with me that we should not accept the advice. This law too is much the same kind of thing. Clearly, it would make cowards of us. We can never follow the advice to be cowards. It is enough that we are in the right and God is on our side. In the end, truth alone will triumph.
 WHAT SHOULD THOSE DO WHO HAVE RECEIVED LETTERS OF NOTIFICATION ?
 A person from Natal writes that he has received an order allowing him to proceed to the Transvaal. Should he do so? Perhaps everyone knows that this order is not a permit. It is futile at present to enter the Transvaal on the basis of such an order. All contact with the Permit Office has been stopped by the  community’s  resolution. Hence the said order can be of no use. It is essential that those not holding old permits should keep away from the Transvaal.
 WHAT ABOUT LOST PERMITS ?
 Under the old law, no one who had lost his permit could get a duplicate. The new Act provides for the issue of a duplicate. However, that refers to a duplicate copy of the new permit. No action need be taken by one who has lost his permit. He should await events without any fear, like other permit-holders.
 CAN THOSE WITH LOST PERMITS ENTER ?
 A certain individual, having lost his permit, obtained a certificate to that effect from the Permit Office. Can he re-enter the Transvaal on return from India? The answer is that he can, just like any other permit-holder. But he should remember that, in the end, he has to go to gaol. Those who are afraid of imprisonment are not to enter the Transvaal at present, whether they hold permits or not.
 SHOULD MR. CHAMNEY’S SIGNATURE BE OBTAINED FOR A LICENCE?
 A man in Boksburg applied for a licence, but the Licensing Officer asked him to obtain Mr. Chamney’s signature. If the Officer said so, it was illegal. As long as the new law has not come into .force, no one is under obligation to show his permit, much less to obtain Mr. Chamney’s permission.
 While replying to questions about licences, I should also state that a correspondent of this journal writes that some persons are trading at present without a licence. The licence may be in the name of one person and trade is carried on by another person. The correspondent has given the names of such persons. I have not been able to verify the truth of his statement. But such men should beware. If the correspondent’s information is correct, I would advise such men to
 give up the evil practice, since the Indian community as a whole has to suffer for the wrongs of a few Indians and, sooner or later, the offending Indian will be punished.
 CHINESE UNITY
 I wrote earlier about the resolution passed by the Chinese not to submit to the new law. Not stopping there, they have signed a  document stating that the signatories would not take out the new permits, but go to gaol and would shun taking food or water with those who should take out permits. Nearly 900  Chinese  have appended their signatures to the document, and now only a hundred Chinese remain whose signatures are yet to be secured. The Chinese appear to be full of enthusiasm.libtech_6_footnote
 A SUGGESTION
 In connection with the proposal that, with a view to keeping the shop running, a permit may be taken out by one person in every shop on the last date fixed for the purpose, or after coming out of gaol, it is further suggested that those who so wish to continue business should contribute to the Law Fund the balance of their earnings after deducting all expenses. If the shopkeepers accept this suggestion, it will be regarded as a highly patriotic step.
 CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST WAITER
An Indian waiter is being tried at Pretoria for offering a bribe of
 £50 to the chief clerk of the Registrar. A critic asks if persons offering bribes to officers have cropped up only now. Did not people make such an attempt before now? If they did, why were no proceedings instituted against them before ?
 CAUTION TO JOHANNESBURG RESIDENTS
 The Police Commissioner has issued a notice to say that several cheats gain access to private houses by posing as Light Inspectors. No one should admit such men, unless they produce the pass issued by the Municipality.
 REGULATIONS FOR HAWKERS
 The dispute regarding regulations for hawkers still goes on. A contributor to The Star says that for a hawker to take out a licence for
 
 every municipal area and for the area outside will mean paying up to
 £80 a year for business within a few miles. Such extortion will ruin the hawkers, and will, for the sake of the shopkeepers, deprive the public of the facility afforded by hawkers. No one should take it that the contributor favours Indians. There are also hawkers other than Indian. The Regulations apply to all of them, and the defence of hawkers in general includes that of Indians also. The point is that we are to oppose only such regulations as are made specially against us.
 EDUCATION BILL
 When the Parliament meets again this month, the new Government is to bring before it a Bill regarding education. The Bill contains a provision preventing black boys from attending schools meant for the whites. It means that, if one wants to start a private school to educate the whites and the blacks together, one cannot do so. Special schools for the blacks will be started if the Government so desires. This again is a new curiosity! The Education Bill indicates what will be gained by Indians if they accept the new law.
 MALAY LOCATION
 A person writes in The Star about insanitary conditions in the Malay Location. He states that it is not the Indians but the Municipality that is at fault here. For the Municipality  does  not provide drainage and taps for drinking water. To this the Municipality replies that there is regular drainage of sewage, and that there are taps for drinking water at many places. If the people are prepared to pay, taps will be provided elsewhere also. The Municipal Officer adds that it could not be claimed that the residents of the Malay Location were not dirty in their habits. Some of them had been prosecuted for insanitation. I, too, have to admit that we cannot deny the charge of insanitation. Many houses are full of filth, the windows are soiled, the fences creak and the state of the latrines is horrible. . The kitchens are very bad. In my view all this is sinful, and we have paid for this heavily and shall have to pay still more heavily. It will be to our great advantage if people learn the value of tidiness, free air and light.

8,,PRIZE POEM ON NEW LAW,"
  
 WINNER AMBARAM MANGALJI THAKAR
 The response to our announcementlibtech_7_footnoteof   a  prize  [for  the  best poem] on the subject of the new law may, on the whole, be considered satisfactory. There were 20 competitors. All of them state that they entered the competition, not with an eye on the prize money, but to express their enthusiasm and to serve the cause of patriotism. This spirit and enthusiasm deserve praise. Even so, we should point out that patriotism is implicit in writing for the prize. There is no need for anyone to be ashamed of accepting the prize; one should rather feel proud.
 The poems of three competitors, out of the total of 20, seemed to have nearly equal merit, and it was somewhat of a problem to decide which poem should be placed first. Considering the terms of the competition, the poem of Mr. Ambaram Mangalji Thakar, the President of the Natal Sanatan Dharma Sabha, was ultimately found to be worthy of the first place and we have sent to him the sum of £1. We congratulate Mr. Ambaram Thakar and hope that he will set an example to others by acting up to the high ideal expressed in his
 
 poem and thereby serve the cause of the country. When devotionmerges into courage and courage into devotion, both are at their best. If we go on doing our duty, armed with both these weapons, we shall surmount every difficulty and come out victorious in the end.
 Of the 20 competitors, some have not communicated even their names to us. Some of them sent in more than one entry. Those of the poems which in our opinion are noteworthy will be published one by one every week, with the author’s name where it has been supplied. If the reader wishes to know the poems which we consider fit for publication and who their authors are, we counsel him patience.
 Having said this, we should like to add that the poems could have been still better if their writers had taken more pains  in composing them. None of the poems reveals any special poetic power or art. If the writers had searched more carefully, they could have found better words and illustrations. We appeal to our readers to work harder and reach a higher level of skill.libtech_8_footnote

9,,NATAL INDIAN CONGRESS,"
  
 The Natal Indian Congress started raising contributions, but we find that the work has slackened down. The notice issued by the Secretaries shows that the Congress is still in debt. We believe that the delay in raising funds is harmful. This is not the time when we can afford procrastination. The Congress has still to put up a big fight against the licensing laws, to oppose the Indentured Labour Act, and, when the time comes, to help the Transvaal Indians. All the three causes are important In the absence of trading licences, merchants will be put to trouble; hence, even from the point of view of self-interest, it is necessary that the Congress should have its coffers well filled. One of the main aims of the Congress, as laid down in 1894,libtech_9_footnotelibtech_10_footnoteis to associate itself with the indentured labourers in their hardships. The Congress cannot therefore merely sit still after what has happened at Thornville.libtech_11_footnotelibtech_12_footnoteIn this land it costs money even to open one’s mouth. The Congress has bound itself to help the Transvaal Indians, since it has advised them to keep up the struggle. Moreover, the Transvaal struggle involves the self-interest of every Indian. We therefore hope that the Congress leaders will bear in mind all these three aims and,
 
 girding up their loins, will soon get ready the weapons of fightin the form of money. This is a task not to be neglected by postponing it from day to day.

10,,GAOL REGULATIONS OF NATAL,"
  
 Our Natal legislators have passed a law which gives sweets to one and cactus to the other. From the Natal Government Gezette we gather that there are four classes of prisoners in Natal:  white,  Coloured, Indian and Kaffir. If any work is taken from the  white  or  the Coloured prisoners, the Government will give them some reward. But the Indian or the Kaffir prisoners who do any work will get nothing. Moreover, the white and the Coloured prisoners are given a towel each, while the Indian and the Kaffir are not given even this as if they do not need it at all. The Government have, in this manner, created classes even among prisoners. The Coloured prisoners include the Cape Boy, the American Negro, the Hottentot and the like.

12,,YUSUF ALI AND WOMEN’S EDUCATION,"
  
 Mr. Yusuf Ali’s book on conditions prevailing in India is widely read. His views on the education of women as expressed therein are worth noting. He says that so long as Indian women do not get proper education, the condition of India is not likely to improve. Woman is known as the better half of man. If a half of one’s body ceases to function, we call it paralysis and the person becomes unfit for any activity. Thus, if women in India are not employed as they should be, it can be said that the entire country suffers from paralysis. How is it surprising then that India is not able to keep pace with other countries? All parents should think of this in regard to their daughters, and all Indians should do likewise with regard to the womenfolk of India. We badly need thousands of women who can compare with Mirabai and Rabia Bibi.

13,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
  
 TRANSVAAL PARLIAMENT
 The second session of the new Parliament began on the 14th. General Botha spoke on the policy the local Government proposed to pursue. The speech deserves the attention of the Indian community. I give below the main points.
 CHINESE TO GO
 The present indentured Chinese labourers will be repatriated on the expiry of their contract. No other indentured Chinese labourers will be imported to take their place. At this rate, 16,000 Chinese will have left the Transvaal by the end of the current year. The rest will go probably by the end of 1908libtech_16_footnote.
 WHO WILL REPLACE CHINESE?
 There will be a shortage of mine labourers when the Chinese leave. One way of meeting the situation will be to get hold of Kaffirs from wherever possible, and have the work done by them. For this purpose, talks are in progress with the Portuguese Government. The alternative is to encourage white labourers to work in the mines, and in
 
 the end to make the Transvaal entirely white. To enable whitelabourers to work on lower wages, the Transvaal will get out of the Customs Agreement. If necessary, it will enter into another agreement. The purpose is to reduce very much the duty payable at present and bring down prices, so that in the end the whites should be able to live as cheaply as in Great Britain. Full encouragement will be given to agriculture so as to change the present position in which the Transvaal depends for its prosperity exclusively on the mines. A special bank will be started with a view to promoting agriculture and providing irrigation.
 This bank will lend money to farmers. To finance the bank the Imperial Government will give the local Government a loan of
£5,000,000.
 CONSEQUENCES OF SPEECH
 This speech has thrown the minds of mine-owners  into confusion. They are not likely to get many Kaffirs as labourers. Therefore the condition of Johannesburg, it is feared, will for years continue to be what it is at present. But the most  important consequence of this is that Indians may have to leave bag  and baggage. It seems to be the firm determination of the local Government to allow no Coloured people except as labourers into the Transvaal. If the Indian community is found lacking in courage, the Government will not hesitate to drive it out. The Indian community is now placed in a situation where it must choose between extermination and counter-attack.
 LABOUR PROTECTION ACT
 My last comment appears to be supported by one more law that is to be passed during the present session. The Gazette has published a Bill to provide for payment of damages to workers and their families in case of disability suffered during performance of duty by workers employed in the various factories. This law is to apply to the whites only. If a white and an Indian labourer are working together in a mine or elsewhere, and if both should get their hand or foot crushed by being caught in a machine, the employer is bound by this law to maintain only the white labourer and his family. The Indian worker does not count at all. He would be doomed, if there were no God in Heaven above. Moreover, no one can suppose that even a penny will be advanced to an Indian by the proposed bank. The bank is solely for the white farmer. This is the marvellous fruit of General Botha’s gallantry. The men of his community watered the soil of the Transvaal with Boer blood. No one has reason to wonder that, having thus
 
 manured the land, they should now reap the golden harvest. If we can have even a trace of the Boers’ courage, we too may roll in prosperity.
 WEENEN’S LETTER
 Mr. Kallenbach’s admiration for the Indian community on the question of going to gaol seems to have proved infectious. The following is the substance of a letterlibtech_17_footnotewritten to The Star  by a white gentleman, Mr. Van Weenen.
 No one with a sense of justice will fail to endorse Mr. Kallenbach’s letter on the subject of Indians. Will the Transvaal go to pieces if a few Indians quietly live and trade in it? It does not behove us to treat as criminals the descendants of a people enlightened long before western civilization blossomed forth. Registration for Indians? The whites who are themselves guilty may be wanting to put this noose round the Indians’ neck. To me the fault of the Indians appears to be that they are diligent. The fact that indolent whites should want to oppress them can be understood. Shall we, however, blame Indians for speaking out against a law which will destroy their very self-esteem? Like Mr. Kallenbach, I too have found among the Indians men worthy of esteem. Mr. Gandhi’s letter shows that the Indian demand is very reasonable. They deserve praise if they think of going to gaol rather than suffer humiliation in case their demand is rejected.
 ESSOP MIA’S LETTER
 Below I give the substance of the letter that Mr. Essop Mia has written to The Star:libtech_18_footnote
 LETTER TO GENERAL BOTHA
 On behalf of the British Indian Association, Mr. Essop Mia had addressed a letterlibtech_19_footnoteto General Botha. He had requested that, as the law had not been brought into effect, the Indian community’s suggestion deserved to be accepted. General Botha replied that correspondence in the matter should be addressed to the Colonial Secretary. Thereupon a communication has been sent to the latter. His reply will perhaps have been received by the time this letter appears in print.
 CONFUSION REGARDING THE “GAZETTE”
Some misunderstanding seems to have occurred regarding the
 
 notification to the effect that the King-Emperor has given assent to the law. Some believe that the law will not come into force for two years. This is a mistake. The notification states that the King-Emperor hasthe authority to veto any law within two years of its passing. On this law being placed before His Majesty, he intimated that he did not intend to veto it. This means that he has forgone the prerogative to veto the law within two years. In other words, it stands confirmed permanently. No, I should not say that. For the Indian who does not accept it, the law stands repealed despite the Royal assent.
 VREDEDORP TRADERS
 It appears that the time has come to taste the fruit of Mr. Ritch’s struggle in England on this subject. The Corporation has appointed two merchants to ascertain the stocks in Indian shops. They have made a cursory inquiry. The Government will now consider all the figures collected. Meanwhile, something curious has happened. The Vrededorp Ordinancelibtech_20_footnoteis not to the liking of some whites. We shall perhaps be saved even as a result of this.
 NO CHANGE IN NEW LAW
 Sir George Farrarlibtech_21_footnotewanted to know from General  Botha  what were the changes that he was reported to have suggested  to  the Imperial Government. In his reply General Botha said, “A deputation met me on behalf of Indians. The Imperial Government, too, had made some recommendations. I said in reply that the law would be so enforced as not to wound the feelings of the Indian community.” Sir George said, “This is no reply to my question. Which particular hardship under the law is intended to be redressed?” “None,” replied General Botha.
 I said earlier that the British Indian Association had written to the Colonial Secretary.libtech_22_footnoteGeneral Botha’s reply shows that it will  be futile to expect any amendment of the law. But it is another matter as to when the law will come into force and whether the suggestion of the Indian community will be accepted. Let the Indian community keep in mind the saying, “Hope of help from others will always end in despair,” and be ready to defend its honour in the Transvaal.

 INTRODUCTION
 In pursuance of our ideas, we commence this week a series of articles on the subject stated above. It will always be our aim to bring about and preserve unity between Hindus and Muslims. One of the ways of achieving this is to acquaint each with whatever is good in the other. Moreover, when occasion requires, Hindus and Muslims should serve each other without any reserve. The series that we are commencing is intended to serve both these aims.
 It is also our object to spread education and culture among the Indian community. With this end in view, we had intended, and still intend, to publish a separate book. We intend to bring out a translation of Justice Ameer Ali’s book on Islam and [another book giving] an account of the hardships of Indians in South Africa. But there is likely to be some delay since there are difficulties in the way which have not yet been overcome.
 Meanwhile, we propose to give every week the biography of the Prophet written by a famous writer, Washington Irving. The biography deserves to be read by both Hindus and Muslims. Most Hindus are ignorant of the career of the Prophet. Most Muslims are ignorant of the researches made by Englishmen and of what they write about the Prophet. The history by Washington is likely to be of benefit to both these classes [of readers]. We do not give a full translation, but only the substance. Washington Irving’s account is considered excellent, and though he has not written ill of Islam like other European writers, it is likely that occasionally his ideas may be such as may not appeal to our readers. A wise man would make himself acquainted even with such ideas. We advise our readers to go through the chapters that follow,libtech_23_footnotebearing  in  mind  that  the  purpose  of  reading  is  to  accept knowledge from everything that we read and to draw the right lesson from it.
 WHO WAS WASHINGTON IRVING?
 We must now answer this question. He was born in the city of New York in America in the year 1783. For many years he lived in Europe. He was one of the front-rank writers of America. He has
 
 written many books, one of which is about the Prophet. He wasconsidered to have an excellent gift for writing. His books have won wide fame. He was a man of character. After the death of the lady to whom he was engaged, he remained a bachelor for the rest of his life, cherishing her memory. He died in his home on November 28, 1859.

       NEW 	LAW    [June 	26, 1907] 
  	The Transvaal Government has sent an ugly reply. In answer to Mr. 	Essop Mia’s letter it says that, as stated in an earlier reply, 	the suggestion made by Indians is not acceptable. That is, the 	Government is intent on enforcing the law. Now we have only to wait 	for the date. I have said that this is ugly news; but it can also be 	taken as good news. The courageous will treat it only as good news.  NEW 	APPOINTMENT  	The Government Gazette announces that Mr. Chamney has been 	appointed Registrar under the new law. I hope the Indian community 	will see that he only sits and yawns. This correspondent’s name 	will never be entered in the register. It is my constant prayer to 	God that the same may be true of every Indian.  UNTOUCHABILITY 	IN MARKET  	Europeans in the Johannesburg market seem to feel polluted by the 	touch of Indians. The Municipality, therefore, has resolved to have 	separate sections for the Europeans and for the black people. It has 	also been decided to charge the Chinese rent for using the outer 	portion. Having a caste of untouchables in our own country, we have 	ourselves become untouchables here. And now with the permit label 	tied to our necks, we shall have been utterly disgraced. I remember 	that, in the market at Port Elizabeth, similar oppression of Indians 	was attempted. Thereupon, they stopped going to the market. If the 	Indian hawkers become equally bold, they can avoid being reduced to 	the status of untouchables. It will be better to leave the Colony 	than to stay on as contemptible creatures for the sake of a living. 
 QUESTION ABOUT DUTCH REGISTER
 A correspondent from Lawley Station says that he has an old Dutch register and also a Dutch witness. If he still cannot obtain a permit,what is he to do? This correspondent does not seem  to haveread Indian Opinion. I have already said that, after the law is brought into force, such an Indian may remain in the Transvaal only if he desires to taste the pleasures of going to gaol.  He  should otherwise leave the Transvaal.
 LEONARD’S OPINION
 Some Indians are afraid that the Government may forcibly deport Indians who do not take out new permits. Such a doubt had occurred to the Chinese also. They therefore sought Mr. Leonard’slibtech_24_footnoteopinion on the subject. Mr. Leonard gave his opinion as follows:libtech_25_footnote
 In answer to the question put to me, I have to advise that I can find nothing in the above Act or in any other statute providing for the deportation of individuals convicted of a breach of the provisions of the Act. Such deportation could not be enforced under any law that I know of. The only penalties prescribed appear to be those provided for by Sections 7 and 8 of Ordinance No. 5 of 1903.
 (Articles 7 and 8 give power to imprison those who do not leave the country.)
This matter may therefore be taken as finally settled.
 HEARSAY REPORT
 There is a rumour that a notice will be published bringing the law into effect from July l. It means that, from that date, those who want it will be branded as slaves. Now on, things will grow more exciting.
 INDIAN BAZAARS
 A notice is published in the Gazette that the Indian Bazaar, that is to say, untouchables’ quarters, has been now made over to the control of the Town Council. For the present the notice has no point, as no one has the authority to force Indians into that Location. All that revolves round the new law. A “sleeping sickness” will overtake the laws relating to the Location and other similar laws if the Indian community cancels the new. law, that is, treats it as cancelled.
 ATTACK ON HAWKERS
The Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Government to take
 
 steps to prevent Indian immigration. In reply, the Colonial Secretary says that in a few days the Immigration Bill will be published. Moreover, Indian trade will be very much reduced as stringent regulations have been framed for hawkers. One may observe from this what the fate will be of those wanting to be branded as thieves under the new law. If the Immigration Bill is published, I propose to give a translation of it next week. We are being pretty well encircled by a conflagration. I take all these as good omens. It is only when a disease becomes acute that its cure can be thought out.
 CURTIS AND NEW LAW
 The Potchefstroom Chamber expressed its thanks to Mr. Curtislibtech_26_footnotefor his efforts in connection with the new law. In his reply, Mr. Curtis says.libtech_27_footnote
 I am much obliged to your Chamber for your letter of May 11. It is inconceivable to me that anyone should not feel the paramount importance of this question. Personally I have no more quarrel with the Asiatic than with the European, but I am persuaded that the mixture of the white and the Asiatic in one society is a curse to both. Each race should in its own interest seek countries which suit them. Asiatic Immigration is only a commercial problem incidentally; in its essence it is a most important problem and ought to be dealt with as such.
 I do hope most earnestly that your Chamber will not consider that the first Act is completed by Mr. Winston Churchill’slibtech_28_footnoteannouncement in the House of Commons. In the absence of any public announcement here to the effect that the formal sanction has been received in the Transvaal, it is always possible that pressure may be brought to modify the regulations to be made under the Act in such a way as to nullify its real effect. The object aimed at by the Act is to secure the complete registration of all Asiatics who have acquired the right to live and trade in the Transvaal coupled with a system  of finger-prints such as will prevent the practice of personation.
 Don’t let us think, however, that everything is finished by printing the law. Much still hangs upon the question as to whether the law is carried into effect. So far as I have been able to judge, the Government have left undone nothing which it was possible for them to do. It is to be hoped that the public, and more specially the Press, will help in the successful administration of this Act. It is the duty of the Press to support the officials who are carrying  it out. The task is not an easy one and may very easily be rendered impossible
 
 
 unless they enjoy a full measure of public confidence. I trust that any attempt to disturb the public confidence in the officers entrusted with these duties will be watched with the utmost jealousy. They have a most invidious duty, and they will incur much personal hostility. If they are attacked in public they cannot defend themselves, and no one, indeed, is in a position to judge their conduct rightly but their own official chief. If I may express an opinion on the subject, it is that no weight be attached to public attacks made on these officers, on the ground that if they are justified the Colonial Secretary will know it and deal with the matter. In a word, I hope that the public will make it clear that so long as the officers enjoy the confidence of  the  Colonial Secretary, they also will enjoy their own. While I was in charge of the office I had constantly to watch attempts to discredit the officers who were most diligent in the performance of their duties, and the public should be warned
 in their own interests to watch such attempts with care.
 Mr. Curtis has put up a wonderful show indeed. First, he exerted himself strenuously to get the law passed. Now he gives advance warning to the public lest the officials enforcing the law should come into trouble. The suggestion is that the public should not bother— whatever the oppression practised by officials. Fortunately for the Indian community, the services of the officials will not now be needed at all. But supposing they had been needed, Mr. Curtis’s  letter  suggests that, even if an official misbehaves, the public should do nothing to bring him to book as they did in the case of Jackson. For, the Colonial Secretary would know all about it. Mr. Curtis has forgotten that Sir Arthur Lawleylibtech_29_footnotelibtech_30_footnotecame to know about   his  officials only when repeated complaints were made to him.
 CHINESE STRUGGLE
 Mr. Kimming of the Chinese Association writes to The Star as under:libtech_31_footnote
 We are quite surprised to find that this shameful Ordinance is again to be forced upon us without even giving us fair consideration.
 What are we? We have to repeat our former decision, that we do not object to voluntary re-registration, but we certainly do not want to be made slaves of the whites. We will not suffer such kind of treatment. Although our life will be at their mercy for refusing to allow ourselves to be degraded by this disgraceful Ordinance, yet we will fight for our right of freedom as bone fide
 
it into conformity with the Gujarati version.
 residents, and fight we will to the bitter end. We ask for nothing unreasonable, but we ask only for fair play and fair treatment.
 The British people are much respected by us in China for their fairness, but to force on us here by them such slavery treatment will not only be a great stain to their good name and respect but will make us and the whole of China entirely lose confidence in them.
 MIDDELBURG LOCATION
 The Middelburg Town Council states that the Indians there do not vacate the Location, and do not even pay rent for the stands used by them; moreover, they use the stands improperly. The Council has therefore decided to prosecute them. Indians residing in the Middel- burg Location should ponder over this. If it is true that they are not paying rent, it will not be proper of them. We should not be in the wrong in any way.
 COMMITTEE’S MISTAKE
 A cable from the South Africa British Indian Committee has been received today (Wednesday). It expresses disapproval of gaol- going as a protest against the law. I trust no Indian will fall into a panic at this. It would have been good if we had won the Commi- ttee’sapproval. But the Committee’s disapproval is underst-andable. Its chief members are well-known retired officials from India. It is possible that they may again hold such offices. It would be surprising if they advised us to oppose the law. It is not at all surprising that they should have asked us to submit to the law. The Committee’s advice is to be treated as counsel’s opinion. They would not ask us to disobey the law. Going to gaol is a step which he alone can understand and take responsibility for who has felt the pressure of circumstances. A meeting of the Association was held to apprise it of the contents of the telegram. The Association decided to send the following cable to the Committee:
 Leaving aside all other considerations, Indian comm- unity, if it were to submit to law, would be dishonouring its oath taken in name of God, and Committee ought not to advise such a course. It is hoped, therefore, that the Committee’s sympathy for Indians will be continued.
 It is good that such a cable has been sent. But the task  undertaken by the Indian community should not be abandoned even if the Committee should break up. The true support of the Indian community is Khuda— Ishwarlibtech_32_footnotelibtech_33_footnote. The Resolution was made with Him as witness and, with trust in Him, we shall swim across to the other shore.
 
 CORRIGENDUM
 In my last letter I said that the remaining Chinese would leave in 1907. A reader has drawn my attention to the mistake. I thank him and correct the error. It should be 1908 instead of 1907.

 "
16,"June 28, 1907",INTERVIEW TO “RAND DAILY MAIL”libtech_34_footnote,"
  
 [June 28, 1907]
 . . . Forewarned of the announcements made above, a representative of the Mail yesterday afternoon interviewed Mr. M. K. Gandhi, the leading light of the Indian community, in regard to the probable attitude and action of the Transvaal Indians.
 [GANDHIJI:] It is difficult to say, what will be the ultimate result of the enforcement of the law, but as far as I and my co-workers areconcerned, we are determined not to submit to the proposed registration, being prepared rather to undergo the last  penalty provided.
 In this attitude, we are not actuated by any disloyal motives, or by a simple spirit of opposition. It is merely dictated by a sense of self-respect.
 In other words, he predicted a large passive resistance crusade, in which he calculated that at least half the British Indians of the Transvaal would take part.
 Of course, it is extremely hard to forecast the result, because through years of disuse such a mode of showing resentment to legislation is new to my countrymen. At the same time, from letters which I have received from all parts of the Transvaal, and from letters sent to the editor of Indian Opinion, I am inclined to think that fully 50 per cent of British Indians in the Transvaal will remain firm in the policy of non-submission. I have not yet heard of a single Indian who has justified the law. Many feel that rather than bear the hardship of gaol, they would leave the country, but I do not know of one who has ever said he will take a new registration certificate under the law.
 Indians, said Mr. Gandhi, were very indignant, and he calculated that 6,000 at least would refuse to register according to the new law.
 
 If the Government persists in prosecuting, these men will go to gaol. That will undoubtedly mean a great loss to them, for many of them have large interests. But they are prepared to sacrifice all in order to preserve their self-respect.
 We feel that having absolutely no voice in the legislation of the country, even when it affects ourselves, the only way that we can resent legislation is by respectful non-submission. If, as a result of non-submission to the law, the Government persists in enforcing compulsory registration, it may be that the question of Indian residence in the Transvaal will be solved to the satisfaction of the colonists, that is to say, Indians may ultimately have to retire from the country. If so, personally I do not envy the colonists the pleasure so long as they profess to be members of the same Empire to which I have the honour to belong. Their attitude will be highly inconsistent with such professions, especially when it is borne in mind that Indians have proved themselves capable of acting according to any promise they have made to the Government.
 Indians undertake to comply with voluntary registration, and that would be just as effective as compulsory registration. A great deal has been said about the law as being lenient and not containing anything hurtful to Asiatic susceptibilities, but I can only say that, having read all the restrictive legislation adopted in the Colonies, I know of nothing so degrading and insulting as the Registration Act.
 Mr. Gandhi concluded by referring to the big meeting held in the old Empire Theatre. At that meeting, he said, 2,000 Indians were present  according  to theestimates of the Press, and they unanimously made a solemn declaration that they would not submit to forcible registration. That declaration, he felt,  would  be faithfully observed.libtech_35_footnote

 "
17,,LORD AMPTHILL,"
  
 Lord Ampthill has earned the undying gratitude of British Indians in South Africa by his courageous and strenuous advocacy of a forlorn cause. The speech delivered by His Lordship during the debate he initiated on the Asiatic Registration Act, in the House of Lords, shows that to him, a British subject is a British subject all the world over, and the word of British statesmen, though given to races
 
 that are not capable of resenting its breach, must be as good as a bond. Let us hope that His Lordship will be pleased to continue as he has begun, and not rest satisfied until he has placed this question of the first magnitude on a proper footing.
 It is of such significance that even Sir George Farrar has to admit that it is infinitely more important than the question of terminating Chinese indentures in the Transvaal, or obtaining a loan from the Imperial Government for the development of agriculture in the Transvaal. The cuttings we have lately received from the Indian papers show that the events affecting Indians in South Africa have made a deep impression on the Indian public. It is a pity, therefore, that, on a question of such recognized weight, Lord Elgin, who is responsible for its proper handling, should not have troubled to take proper bearings. We are grieved to notice that His Lordship has accepted, perhaps unconsciously, the bait offered by the Transvaal Government, and confused the question of immigration with that of the treatment of Indians domiciled in the Transvaal.  The  British  Indian Association has shown, we think conclusively, that the Asiatic Registration Act does not regulate the immigration of British Indians, and a near Act will have to be passed, and is, in fact, actually projected, if the Peace Preservation Ordinance is to be repealed, as Lord Selbornelibtech_36_footnotelibtech_37_footnotehas stated it should be. The Registration Act, without solving the immigration question in any shape or form,  degrades  British Indian residents of the Transvaal and its incidence changes the cherished maxim of the British Constitution, namely, that every man isto be presumed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty, and that, rather than an innocent man should suffer, guilty ones should go unpunished. This Act presumes every Indian to be guilty, and throws on him the onus of proving that he is not so, that is to say) that he has entered the Transvaal in a bona fide manner. It, again, punishes the whole Asiatic community in the Transvaal in a brutal manner, in order that a few fraudulently inclined Asiatics may not steal into the Transvaal, and yet, the Act falls short of even this purpose, for registration will not prevent Asiatics who are so inclined from stealing into the country and remaining in it until they are found out. The Act is like locking up honourable men in cells, so that thieves may not steal.
 Lord Elgin has, moreover, accepted the bare statement that there has been illicit traffic in permits. The British Indian Association has asked for production of proof, times without number, but this has
 
 never been produced. Mr. Chimney’s report, as we have shown, bears out the Asiatic contention to its fullest extent.libtech_38_footnotelibtech_39_footnoteThus, the Act imposes a double wrong upon the Asiatic community—it is based on a false charge against the community, and, in effect, is a punitive measure. No wonder, then, that both the Chinese and the Indian residents of the Transvaal have decided not to submit to compulsory registration and all that the Act connotes. If Asiatics really resent the Act, non-submission is the only straightforward course for them, no matter what it may cost them materially, and we trust that, in their struggle, they will receive the sympathy of Lord Ampthill and his co-workers in  a cause which can bring them no renown or credit save the gratitude of poor, helpless people.

18,,ANGADA’S MISSION OF PEACElibtech_40_footnote,"
  
 It is said that, before Shri Ramachandra began his war with Ravana, he despatched Angada on a peace mission to him. In those times it was believed that true strength lay in affording the enemy, before starting a war against him, every opportunity to set right the wrong he had done. By all means, bow to the enemy, for there is no dishonour in doing so. If still the enemy refuses to come round, one may bring one’s full strength into play and enforce one’s will. In olden times people everywhere in the world followed this practice. Today also this is considered the best thing to do.
 What Rama did with Ravana, the Indian community has done with the Transvaal Government. All possible civility has been shown, but the Transvaal Government will not feel happy until it enforces the new law against every Indian.
 Rama sent Angada on the mission of peace. However much Angada tried, he could not make Ravana understand. And in the end, Ravana was defeated because he was in the wrong. To the Indian community's request to the Government through the British Indian Association, a final reply has been received from Mr. Smuts, to say that the voluntary re-registration suggested by the community is not acceptable to the Government. So now it remains for us to await notification of the date when the law will come into force. We can assume that the Government is busy making regulations under the
 
 Act. It may be that in the matter of taking digit-impressions some change will be made. But that will not meet the wishes of the Indian community in any way. The community has, therefore,  only  to prepare for the struggle. For this the community does not need much. It needs nothing more than firmness in adhering to  the  gaol resolution. The letters we have received indicate that the Indian community is already prepared for the task. If so, the Transvaal Government's rejection of our request is for us a matter of joy rather than disappointment. We shall now have a test of who is right and who is wrong.

19,,FAMINE IN SOUTH AFRICA,"
  
 South Africa is now passing through very hard times. Scarcity prevails everywhere. Both the whites and the Coloured people have been reduced to a precarious condition. The greatest difficulty is felt by landlords and traders At such a time, far-sighted men should think what is to be done. Business will be slacker still and land values fall further. How long can this last? The crisis in this country is not due to lack of rains or damage to crops. The land which was the source of money has ceased to be fruitful. We can see from this that there is no loss in agriculture as such. Our advice therefore is that, taking advantage of the opportunity, every Indian who can should devote his attention to agriculture. Indians, traders as well as others, can take to farming. This does not need much money, and there is no problem of taking out licences, etc. We are certain that, if the Indian community pays sufficient attention to agriculture, not only will it bring profit to itself but it may also help remove the prejudice prevailing against it in this country. The soil being virgin, there is scope here for crops of various kinds. If by any chance the produce does not sell here, it can be exported. The Dutch have been making efforts in the Transvaal to bring prosperity to the land through agriculture. A similar attempt isin progress in Natal. Every Indian should take a hint from this and turn his attention to agriculture.

 The South Africa British Indian Committee is still carrying on agitation against the new law. Lord Ampthill, who has become Chairman of the Committee, is exerting himself strenuously. We draw attention to the speechlibtech_41_footnotelibtech_42_footnotethat he made in the House of Lords.   That speech will show how feelings in England are running high on the question of the new law. Everyone feels that the Indian community is labouring under heavy oppression. To prove that it is so, the Indian community cannot but adhere to the gaol resolution.

 The women of England want to secure the right to franchise.libtech_43_footnoteAn authorized report of their Association has been published, which shows that it spends nearly £100 every week on its activities, and that so far, that is during the last two years, the women sentenced to gaol for the rights of their sisters have suffered imprisonment for an aggregate period of six years. The lady who is Secretary of the Association states that £20,000 will yet be needed to carry on its work and requests every member to help in collecting the sum.
 When so much has to be spent and such hardships have to be borne by English women for winning their rights from their own compatriots, let all Indians calculate by the rule of three how much the Indian community will have to spend and what hardships it will have to endure to win its rights from a foreign people. Let them consider in this way whether it would be, after all, such a mighty task if they had to spend £13,000 and 13,000 Indians had to go to gaol. Till now Indians have not spent even £2,000 all told, and no Indian has so far suffered imprisonment. And yet to believe that we could get our rightsis, it would seem, a patent mistake.

 The eyes of India are now fixed on the Transvaal. A meeting of ten thousand Indians at Madras passed a resolution that, in view of the hardships suffered by Indians in South Africa, the whites from the Colony should be debarred from service and other opportunities in India. The Tribune of Lahore writes that a great deal will be gained if the Indian community maintains its spirit till the end. The  whole Indian Press continues to discuss the subject and everyone expresses sympathy. Officials like Lord Lansdowne have realized that the oppression of Indians [here] is having adverse effects in India. All these signs indicate that the Indian community has now an invaluable opportunity of proving its mettle.

           TO THE 	EDITOR     JOHANNESBURG,  July 	1, 1907 
 [RAND 	DAILY MAIL] SIR,  	It may appear ungrateful to have to criticize your moderate and 	well-meant leaderette on the so-called “passive resistance” to 	the Asiatic Registration Act. I call the passive resistance to be 	offered by the Indian community “so-called”, because, in my 	opinion,  it  is really not resistance but a policy of communal 	suffering. Even after reading the Regulations, you consider it to be 	a matter of sentiment.  	Is it sentiment, if I, as a father, would prefer to be shot down 	before I see my eight-year-old boy being subjected to the tyrannical 	process of having to give his digit-impressions, separately and then 	simultaneously, before an officer whom he may never have seen in his 	life-time, and for no crime of his own? Is it sentiment, when I 	decline to give the name of my mother and such particulars as the 	price of a precarious residence in this country?  	Lord Elgin may certainly, sitting in his cushioned chair, see no 	distinction between making a mark with the thumb instead of with a 	pen, but I know that he belongs to that nation which would rise in 	rebellion from end to end to resent an attack on personal liberty, 	and that he would be the first person to cry out against even a 	forcible tracing of his signature. It is the compulsion that stings, 	not the digit-impression. That 	in the mind of the Government there is no desire to    
 degrade is true only on the assumption that my countrymen  are already sufficiently degraded to feel any further degradation in this land of freedom for people other than Asiatics. But this is not a time for argument. The brave rulers who know the value of action rather than of speech can only respond to bravery and practical action.
 If, as you say, Pretoria is weak, and the Government, “with the wisdom of the serpent”, with which you credit it, has chosen the weakest spot in order to break any opposition to it, and if I shall be the only one to have cried out against the Act, and possibly a few of my co-workers, even then we shall be able to say we had no part in the acceptance of degradation. But I do not share your opinion about Pretoria. I had the honour to be one of the speakers who, yesterday, addressed a large mass meeting of British Indianslibtech_46_footnoteon the premises of the local Secretary, Mr. Haji Habib, and I assure you that, if the sentiments expressed by my countrymen proceeded from the bottom of their hearts, as I believe they did, Indians in Pretoria will refuse to submit to compulsory re-registration to a man, irrespective of consequences.
 You accuse the South Africa British Indian Committee, in blunt language, of gross exaggeration, if not falsehood, when it states that “the local Government lends colour to the suspicion that it is anxious to impose the most extreme measures, and thus to degrade and humiliate British Indians”. Even at the risk of being guilty of gross exaggeration or falsehood, whichever it may be, I must repeat the statement and, in support, give you the latest illustration of studied humiliation that came to light at the Pretoria meeting. One of the religious preachers created a painful sensation when he produced a documentlibtech_47_footnotefrom the Central South African Railways saying that the concession to religious preachers as to railway travelling was confined to Christian and Jewish preachers. Is this new distinction also a necessary precaution against an influx of Asiatics?

 JOHANNESBURG,
 Wednesday evening, [July 3, 1907]
 The new Immigration Billlibtech_49_footnotehas been introduced. According to this Bill, an English-knowing person can enter [the Transvaal] provided he is not an Indian. It appears that those who are covered by the obnoxious law will not be allowed to enter, irrespective of whether they know Englishor not. Moreover, under this Bill, the Government will be able to deport anyone whom it considers undesirable, and the expenses of deportation can be recovered from his property. Now, indeed, are the Indians pressed hard. I do not know whether the Bill will be passed or not. But there is not the slightest doubt that the Transvaal Government wants to drive out the Indians. I  hope  if Indians have to leave, they will do so honourably and not in disgrace.

  	You have, much to the surprise of the Indian community, informed 	your readers that Indians suffer from practically no disabilities, 	and that the question of giving digit-impressions is one to be 	dismissed from consideration, as the Indian sepoy voluntarily gives 	his thumb-mark before receiving his pension.  	I wonder whether you would now support the Immigration Bill 	published yesterday, as being an innocuous measure so far as Indians 	are concerned. Asiatics have been credited with unfathomable 	subtlety, but that displayed by the framers of the Bill certainly, 	to use a vulgarexpression, takes the cake. It is, if my reading of 	Sub-section 4 of Section 2 be correct, I take it, an answer to 	“passive resisters” to the Asiatic Registration Act; and, in 	order to break the spirit of the last vestige of dignity that yet 	remains in Indians in  the  Transvaal,  a system of State robbery is 	instituted. For the section in question makes an Asiatic who does 	not take out the new registration certificate a prohibited 	immigrant, and a prohibited immigrant is liable to suffer 	imprisonment and then to be physically deported, the expenses of 	deportation to be levied from the estate, found within the Colony, 	of the deported. Thus, the law manufactures a prohibited immigrant 	by a most circuitous method. A man who has made the Transvaal his 	home, but who, rightly or wrongly, protests against a law applicable 	to him, by way of suffering further penalty is to be treated as an 	outlaw in the country of his adoption. The section in question, 	moreover, can only refer to the Asiatic and Immorality Acts, that is 	to say, prostitutes, pimps, and Asiatics who refuse to surrender 	their self-respect are to be classed in the same category.  	Moreover, to show the wantonness of the insult offered, I draw the 	attention of the public to the fact that if an Indian who may 	satisfy the most rigorous test, say, for instance, Sir Mancherji, 	wishes to enter the Transvaal, he must, perforce, take out a 	registration certificate for himself and his minor children, the 	latter also, if over eight years, to   32	THE 	COLLECTED WORKS 	OF MAHATMA GANDHI 
 give their separate and simultaneous digit-impressions, unless he  wishes to be classed as a prohibited immigrant and to be deported. Now the Registration Act is intended, so it is said, to serve as a measure of identification only. Is there any meaning in identifying a man who, by reason of his possessing educational qualifications, can claim to remain in the Transvaal but for the Asiatic Act? Does he not carry marks of identification on his own person, seeing that he is liable to be examined as to his knowledge of a European language, at any time, whether within or without the Colony?
 What becomes of the speeches of General Botha,libtech_50_footnotelibtech_51_footnotewho showed so much anxiety, when in London, for the welfare of the Empire as a whole, who assured Lord Ampthill that there was no intention of imp- osing humiliation on Indian subjects of the Crown? Is self-govern- ment to mean a licence to deprive Asiatics, without check, of all lib- erty? Sir George Farrar, speaking on behalf of the Progressive Party, stated that the question underlying the Asiatic Registration Act was of the highest importance, that the passing of the Act inflamed millions of Indians unnecessarily against the British Empire. And yet, in order to assist the Government, Sir George, at the risk of wounding, at a most inopportune time, the susceptibilities of Indian subjects of King Edward, supported the Asiatic Registration Act. Is the  Progressive Party to approve of the Immigration Bill withthe hideous clause to which I have drawn attention, in spite of its boast of Imperialism?

28,,FAT IN THE FIRE,"
  
 Our Pretoria Correspondent, in sending a report of the proceedings of the mass meeting at Pretoria, says that production by Mr. Moulvi Ahmed Mukhtiar of a letter from the C.S.A.R.libtech_52_footnotecreated quite a sensation. The letter we consider to be a very important document and it runs as follows:
 In reply to your letter of the 24th instant which has reference to the travelling expenses of a priest ministering to the religious needs of the Mahomedan community in the Transvaal, I desire to state that, as the concession accorded to Ministers of Religion over the C.S.A.R. is not
 
 
 extended to religions other than the Christian or Jewish, I am unable to grant the special facilities asked for.
 It is signed by no less a personage than the Chief Traffic Manager. It ends, in our opinion, all hopes of fair treatment promised by General Botha. The letter overrides the boast of the Empire that within it there are no religious distinctions. Racial distinctions we have, unfortunately, become used to. But the Asiatic Act has led the way by laying down a religious demarcation. And the lead has been followed by the Railway Department. Indians wishing to remain in the Transvaal know what they are to expect from the authorities. We  wonder what justification Lord Elgin proposes to offer for this latest instance of wanton insult to the religious susceptibilities of a people whose rock is religion and who— both Hindus and Mahomedans—are easily moved by an attack on their religion.

29,,POINT OF HONOUR,"
  
 The Amir of Afghanistan has had his status raised from “His Highness” to “His Majesty”.libtech_53_footnotelibtech_54_footnoteThis did not happen quite easily. It was when he made it a point of honour that he was accorded due respect by the British. Before visiting India, he had made it a condition that his status should be fully maintained and that the Government should make noreference to political matters. Lord Curzonlibtech_55_footnotelibtech_56_footnotehad also invited him to visit India. But he had then flatly declined the invitation. The reason  for  this  has  been  disclosed  by  Mr.  Morleylibtech_57_footnotelibtech_58_footnotein  his  budget speech. Speaking at Kabul, His Majesty the Amir said: “This time the officers of the Indian Government maintained a discreet silence on political matters. As they kept their word, I referred to the subject myself of my own free will and they too did not misuse the reference. I accepted Lord Minto’slibtech_59_footnotelibtech_60_footnoteinvitation as it was politely worded. Between the invitation at the time of the Delhi Durbar and the one by Lord Minto now there is a world of difference. I had therefore decided not to attend the Delhi Durbar. Rather than accept that unworthy invitation, I thought I would lose my crown, become a beggar and
 
“Lord Curzon”, 26-8-1905.
 even suffer death.” It was this sense of honour that secured respect for His Majesty and Lord Curzon was discomfited.
 It is along these lines that the Transvaal Indian community also has to think. It is necessary to take the pledge that, even if we lose everything, we shall not submit to the new law. We publish in this number a translation of the Regulations that have been gazetted. They are harsher and more stringent than anyone could have even dreamt of. The sweet words spoken by General Botha in England have been washed away. We are very glad. If the poisonous pill of the new law had been wrapped up in the silver foil of mild regulations, some credulous Indians might have been misled. Now there is not a single Indian who will accept such a law and such regulations.
 Let us for a moment consider what will be gained by the Indian who submits to the law. Firstly, he will have forsaken his  God. Secondly, his honour will have been lost. Thirdly, he  will  have incurred the curse of all India. Fourthly, there will come a time when he will have to go to a Location and at last live a dog’s life in the Transvaal. Is there any Indian who will gain such ‘benefits’ by submitting to the law? Now let us take the case of the Indian who does not submit. This Indian will have lived in fear of God and kept his covenant with Him. He will be regarded as a hero and acclaimed by all India. The gaol he enters will be considered a palace. The utmost that he will suffer is that he may lose all his possessions and may have ultimately to leave the Transvaal. If he has to leave the Transvaal and go elsewhere, is not God there also? The Lord who has given us teeth is ever present to give us something to chew. He needs no flattery. He whispers constantly into our ears, “Trust in Me alone.” If we do not listen to. His sweet words, having earswe are deaf. If we do not see Him sitting by our side, having eyes we are blind.
 If the Indian community adheres to its pledge, we reckon that no Indian will be ruined and that not only the Transvaal Indians, but also all Indians in South Africa will be freed. For the Indian people will come to know their own strength, and the brave Boers will recognize our courage.
 Once there was a lion who had since birth grown up among lambs. He had forgotten his true self and had come to regard himself as a lamb. Seeing a herd of lions, he became somewhat aware of his true self. This applies to the Indian lion. We have forgotten ourselves for a long time and have been reduced to helplessness. Now the time
 has come for us to realize our true self, and therefore, Placing your trust in the Master,
Full and sincere,
Be glad in your heart
 That to gaol you'll go, certainly to gaol you'll go.libtech_61_footnote[From Gujarati]

30,,S. A. B. I. COMMITTEE’S ADVICE,"
  
 We have already published the Committee’s cable about the Transvaal law.libtech_62_footnoteIt can be seen from Mr. Ritch’s letter that we need not in the least be scared by the Committee's cable. Even if the Committee should disown us, we cannot retrace the step that, after mature consideration, we have taken about going to gaol. To a man setting out on an adventure, other people's advice is of no use.
 When Dr. Jameson carried out his raid [on Johannesburg] in the Transvaal, he sought nobody's advice. The attack has now been forgotten, but his bravery is praised even today. He is now a friend of General Botha and runs the Government of the Cape.
 English suffragettes were politely advised by Sir Henry Camp- bell-Bannerman the Prime Minister of Englandlibtech_63_footnote, to give up the met- hod of seeking imprisonment. Among those ladies there was an aged sister of General Frenchlibtech_64_footnote. That prudent counsel was rejected by those brave women. How should Sir Henry know how much they suffer for being without franchise? When these courageous Englishwomen are carryingon a struggle for winning new rights, paying no heed to anyone’s new rights, paying no heed to anyone’s advice, how can the Indians in the Transvaal give up their struggle for safeguarding their existing rights and their freedom, though the Committee or any other big people may advise them to do so?

31,,WHAT A SAD PLIGHT!,"
  
 If clouds have gathered in the Transvaal, Natal will not be left behind. The Coloured races are being constantly dominated by the Europeans. A Bill has now been introduced in the Natal Parliament providing that Indian landlords, who have been cultivating their lands themselves and who let them now to other Indians or Kaffirs, shall pay on those lands double the tax that the Europeans pay. Only the Europeans of South Africa are capable of such justice! But it has always been the way of the world to add humiliation to defeat. Therefore, the grievances of Indians will disappear only when they raise their heads and stand up to fight. Of course, it will be necessary for the Congress to make petitions, etc.

32,,"NATAL, ARE YOU AWAKE OR ASLEEP?","
  
 The Transvaal Indian knocks at the door of the Natal Indian and asks this question. He says, ‘We shall stake everything and fight to the finish.’ Will the Natal Indians come to the help of those fallen on the field or will they keep aloof? Every Indian in Natal has to make up his mind as to the answer to this question.
 If the Natal Indians mean to help those in the Transvaal, they too should honour their pledge. It is true the Natal Indian leaders have given encouragement to the Transvaal Indians but that was through letters and telegrams. The time has now come to honour their word, both spoken and written. We therefore appeal to Indians in Natal to wake up, lest people should sing of them:
 Men without honour promise more than they mean, But never a single pledge do they keep.

 ATROCIOUS REGULATIONS
 The expected has happened. It has been notified in the Transvaal Gazette that the new law will come into force from July l.

 NOTICE
 It is notified in the Gazette that Asiatics residing in Pretoria must apply for the new register to Mr. Richard Terence Cody, at 70, Church Street, before July 31, 1907.
 Mr. Cody will remain present at the place referred to above from Monday to Friday between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., and on Saturday up to 2 p.m.
 EFFECT OF RULES
 The	Rules   include	the	following	additional	points	not anticipated earlier:
  In 	India, Hindus and 	Muslims respect the 	mother so 	deeply that 	if anyone 	compels them to 	make a 	reference to 	her name, 	that may 	lead to 	murder. The 	name of 	the mother 	will have now 	to be entered in 	an application.  It 	was never dreamt that 	impressions of all 	fingers would be 	required from 	children. Now 	they will take eighteen 	such prints. It 	is the usual 	experience that 	delicate children of 	nine years will start 	crying if 	touched by 	a stranger. 	These delicate 	Indian children will now 	have contact with 	rough hands. 	Fathers will look 	on while impressions of 	their fingers 	are being taken.  Not 	only that impressions of 	all fingers 	will have to be given, but it will be done twice—together and separately.  The 	police have 	orders to 	take impressions—of 	children as well 	as of adults.  If 	a merchant 	goes out, and the 	application for 	licence is 	made by 	his partner, 	he will 	need to have with him 	the power of 	attorney from the 	merchant, bearing the 
 
 thumb-impression of his right-hand. This is insulting in the extreme. From now on, a signature will not be sufficient on the power of attorney by an Indian, but a thumb- impression will be required.
  All 	applications will 	be prepared 	by officers. 	No one 	can have 	them prepared by a 	lawyer or agent. 
 At first sight it may appear that this rule will save expenditure. But looking at it more closely, we find that it is like being served with a sweet dish with a tiger in front. Even adult Indians become nervous in the presence of officers. What then can we expect of children?

MASS MEETING AT PRETORIAlibtech_73_footnote","
 In view of the fact that the new law was to come into force in Pretoria from July 1, there was a huge mass meeting on Sunday, June
 Indians 	from Johannesburg 	went there 	specially at their 	own expense. 	Among those who 	attended were 	the Acting 	President, Mr. 	Essop Mia, Moulvi Saheb 	Ahmed Mukhtiar, 	and Messrs 	M. S. Coovadia, Emam 	Abdool Cadir, 	Omalji Sale, Makanji, Zinabhai, Gulabbhai 	Kikabhai, Morarji Desai, Gulabbhai Patel, Bhula, Ranchhod 	Nichhabhai, Nadirshaw 	Cama, Mahomed Essak, 	Khushal, Peter Moonlight, 	Naidoo, A. 	S. Pillay, Gandhi and 	others. From 	Pretoria nearly 	four hundred Indians attended, 	including, besides Mr. 	Hajee Habib, 	the Moulvi 	Saheb of the 	mosque at 	Pretoria, Mr. 	Hajee Cassim 	Jusab, Mr. Hajee 	Osman, Mr. Cachalia, 	Mr. Ally, 	Mr. Hajee 	Ibrahim, Mr. 	Gavarishankar Vyas, 	Mr. Prabhashankar 	Joshi, Mr. Mohanlal Joshi, 	Mr. Omarji 	and other gentlemen. 
 The delegates from Johannesburg were looked after by Mr.
Hajee Habib and Mr. Vyas.
 The meeting commenced punctually at 3 p.m. and continued up to 7 p.m. Welcoming them all, Mr. Hajee Habib said that the new law was barbarous. So long as the Regulations [under it] were not published, he had hoped that if they happened to be reasonable the law could perhaps be accepted. But after going through  the Regulations, there could be no question of accepting the law. The Indian community must unitedly oppose the law. He proposed that
 
 Mr. Essop Mia should take the chair.
 Mr. Essop Mia thanked Mr. Hajee Habib for placing his house at their disposal. He asserted that the law being poisonous, they could not respect it. He showed himself ready to serve the community even at the cost of his personal affairs. He wanted all people to stand together. So far, they had remained submissive, but they could not remain so any longer. Nowhere in the world did they ask for the mother’s name. Only on the Day of Judgement would they be identified by their mother’s name. But now the Government would ask them to give the mother’s name. The Indian community would never submit to such slavery.
 Mr. Gandhi explained the implications of the law and said that it was necessary for every Indian, whether rich or poor, to be free. Thatthis law had been approved by the [Imperial] Government made no deference. It still remained to be approved by the Indian community.
 Unless it was accepted by the Indian community, it could not be taken that the law had been passed. If any Indian, big or small, should accept the title-deed of slavery under the law, others would not follow his example. Those who kept themselves free would win in the end.
 In a spirited speech, Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar pointed out that it was necessary for all of them to stand together. They alone were true Muslims who attended to the claims of worldly affairs as well as to those of religion. When Hazrat Yusuf Abesalam was placed in a distressing situation, he prayed to God that he might be sent to gaol instead. No Indian should submit to the oppressive law. He suggested that a committee should visit every place to educate public opinion. If such a committee was appointed, he would also be ready to join it.
 Mr. Naidoo spoke in Tamil and asserted that, even if he were to die, he would not submit to the law.
 Mr. Omarji Sale also made a speech and asked  Indians  to remain united and to boycott the Permit Office.
 Mr. M. S. Coovadia supported the previous speaker. Mr. Cama said that the law was so bad that no Indian with self-respect could think of submitting to it. He would not submit to it, even if he were to lose everything, including his life.
 Mr. Emam Abdool Cadir said that he could not submit to the law, whoever else among the Indians did. It inflicted a sentence of imprisonment worse than that of transportation for life. The Moulvi Saheb gave his support to the resolution and declared that he was ready for a tour of all places.
Mr. Makanji said that he had thought of accepting the law if it
 afforded the slightest relief. But now it was his firm determination that he would not accept it, whoever else did so.
 Mr. Hajee Ibrahim also spoke and said in conclusion that thelaw could not be accepted.
 Mr. Noormahomed Ayub said that it was a golden opportunity for the Indians to show their spirit.
 Messrs Ismail Jooma, Manji Nathu,  Trimbaklal  and  Hajee Osman Haji Aba spoke in the same strain.
 Mr. Cachalia said that he would give an assurance that 90 per cent. of Suratis would go to gaol.
Mr. Omarji gave the same assurance.
 Mr. Gavarishankar Vyas pointed out that, to those who were true to their faith, the oath of September was sufficiently, binding.
 Mr. Nimji Anandji exhorted them never to submit to the law. Mr. Pillay also made an inspiring speech.
 Messrs Gulab Rudra Desai Khushal Chhita, Gulam Mahomed and Musa Suleman said that they would persuade everyone found on his way to the Permit Office to return.
 Mr. Haji Cassim said that the law could not be accepted by the Indian community in any circumstances.
 Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar pointed out that the duty of the priest was not merely to lead prayers but also to share fully the hardships of the people. It is because the whites wanted to insult their religion that they made distinctions in regard to railway fares. The railway officials told them that Christian and Jewish priests were entitled to concession tickets for railway journeys, but not Indian Muslims. The Indian community would never acquiesce in such slavery.
 In the course of his concluding speech, Mr. Essop Mia offered his shawl as a gift to Mr. Gulab Rudra Desai, in token of his appreciation of the latter’s courage and said that he was ready to give up his personal work and devote himself to the service of the people. There was a heavy burden on his fellow-countrymen at Pretoria and he was convinced that they would shoulder it quite well. The whole Indian community was grateful to Mr. Hajee Habib for his hospitality.
 The business was concluded on this note of enthusiasm, and the meeting came to an end at seven o’clock.

35,,INTERVIEW TO “RAND DAILY MAIL”,"
    
 It has been notified in the Transvaal Government Gazette that the Asiatic Act will come into force on July 1.  The Regulations framed under this new Act have been published and according to them impressions of all fingers will be taken simultaneously  and singly. A representative of the Rand Daily Mail interviewed Mr. Gandhi with a view to obtaining the reactions of Indians to these Regulations. The following report was published in the issue of the Rand Daily Mail of the 29th [ultimo].libtech_74_footnote
 My co-workers and I will undergo the extreme penalty prescribed by law rather than submit to the law for Asiatics that has been passed. No self-respecting Indian will submit to this Act. From the letters received by me and the editor of Indian Opinion, about fifty per cent of the Indian population in the Transvaal will resist the law. I have not met a single Indian so far who justifies it. Some assert that they will leave this country. But I have not come across a single person who even talks of applying for a register. Indians are very angry and at least 6,000 persons will refuse to apply for registers. If they are prosecuted by the Government, they will be ready to go to gaol. No doubt they will run into loss by doing so. But they are ready to sacrifice their all for the sake of their self-respect. Since we have no say even in regard to the making of laws that affect us, we feel that there is only one course left to us, and that is, not to submit to any law.
 It has been said that the law is mild. But I must say that I have read the laws of many colonies, and in not a single colony have I come across a law so insulting and humiliating as this Act. Two thousand people were present at the meeting in the Empire Theatre, and they have solemnly resolved with one voice that they will not get registered under compulsion. I am confident that they will keep the oath.

 NEW LAW
 The Regulations, which Indians had been awaiting for long, have now been published. A Gujarati proverb says, “As is the father, so is the son; as is the banyan tree, so is its fruit.” Likewise, as is the Act, so are the Regulations. Those who had hoped for some leniency in the Regulations are disappointed. I for my part am very glad that the Regulations are unexpectedly stringent. This has made every Indian resolute. All Indians say that there is now no alternative to gaol-going.
 SNAKES IN GRASS
 There is a proverb in English that green grass sometimes harbours green snakes which remain invisible. Their presence is felt only when they bite. The same is true of these Regulations. Only now do I realize that there are some snakes hidden in them. When I first read them, I could not follow some of their implications.  I  had thought that no one was likely to be interrogated so long as the new permits or title-deeds of slavery had not been issued. Now, on second thoughts, I see that, according to the powers granted to the police under the Regulations, they can require any Indian to give his finger-prints and state his antecedents. Again, this may be required as often as the police choose. One has to beware of this snake. If the Government should choose to apply pressure by turning this screw, the Indian community will perhaps feel baffled. But the remedy is clear. Under no circumstances is any Indian to give his finger-prints. All these days we used to give the thumb-impression. But now that the thumb-impression has been made obligatory, we should refuse to give even that. What will be the consequence of this? The gaol, of course. The thought of gaol should be an ordinary matter to every Indian. According to the new law, the penalty for not furnishing  the particulars or identity marks that the police may demand, is fine or imprisonment. In no case is the fine to be paid. Thus, only gaol remains. I also advise that no one coming from Volksrust should now give his thumb-impression or finger-prints to the police. When, in consequence, he is taken to a magistrate, he should prove [his right]. If the magistrate should still sentence him to gaol, he should undergo the sentence. Again, this struggle is only for those who have a true
 case, that is, what is stated above applies only to those who hold a permit bearing their own thumb-impression. This needs a good deal of courage, but that courage we ought to have and will certainly have.
 ANOTHER SNAKE
 That was but one snake. Another snake relates to the question of licences. I thought the taking of finger-prints in connection with licences would commence in January. But I now find that it comes into force immediately. For finger-prints can be demanded of anyone seeking a licence. This matter may not have been noticed even by revenue officers. I hope therefore that Indians have already taken out their licences. But how long can we carry on like this?  The Government has brought in the question of finger-prints everywhere. We have therefore to be particularly careful. I had believed that the provisions of the law would be duly complied with if one person in each big shop held a permit, but on reflection, I see that it is but following a mirage to keep on hoping that one person could carry on the trade. I ought, therefore, to say that it will be good for the merchants to give up, if necessary, all hopes of continuing trade. If we hold ourselves ready to sacrifice our business for the sake of the country and our self-respect, we shall not get panicky when the time comes. It does not, moreover, seem proper that one should, even for the sake of one’s trade, give the finger-prints and be a bondsman. The best and the only course is to repose full trust in God and sacrifice everything for the good of the country. We shall surely need such unalloyed courage to achieve success.
 PRETORIA’S OPPORTUNITY
 Issuing of the title-deed of slavery has started with Pretoria. Hence a great responsibility has devolved on it. But it has also the opportunity of proving its mettle. All Indians wish and pray to God that Pretoria may act in a manner worthy of itself.
 COMMENT BY “DAILY MAIL”
 A correspondent of the [Rand] Daily Mail saw Mr. Gandhi on Friday last and obtained some information from him.libtech_75_footnoteMr.  Gandhi told him that at least 6,000 Indians were certain to go to gaol. The Indian community would not swerve from the pledge taken in the name of God. There was no disloyalty involved in disobeying the law.
 
 In so doing, the Indian community sought only to preserve its honour and self-respect. One could not say how one would become free by thus opposing the law. But the brave colonists would be able to appreciate the courage of the Indians. Even if that did not happen, still by going to gaol, the Indian community would at least have shaken the Transvaal’s dust off its feet instead of staying on there under conditions of slavery.
 Commenting upon this interview, the Daily Mail expresses its sympathy, but says that the Indian community should accept the law because it was not the object of the Government to humiliate them. The Government’s object in taking finger-prints was to prevent the entry of other Indians. The correspondent of the Daily Mail further states that the Government has purposely begun with Pretoria as it is the weakest of all. This being so, Pretoria Indians are certain to take out the new registers and the others will follow as a matter of course. I am sure Pretoria will give a fitting reply to this aspersion and show itself courageous.
 REPLY TO RAND DAILY MAIL
 To this letter in the Daily Mail, Mr. Gandhi has made the following reply:libtech_76_footnote
 COMMENT BY “THE STAR”
 The Star is also very critical, and, feeling alarmed, asserts that the Indian community has no grievance other than the giving of ten fingerprints. Indians would not be sent out of Vrededorp without compensation. It adds that Indians are also free to use the tram-cars. As for finger-prints, the Indian sepoys give them in India.
 All this is patently false. Payment of compensation at Vrededorp is problematic. Indians are even now being pushed out of the trams. Only The Star can say that there is no difference between voluntary giving of finger-prints by Indians and taking them forcibly from merchants as if they were illiterate sepoys. However, it can be seen from the comments appearing in both the Mail and The Star that the Indian community’spreparation for a struggle has given rise to nervousness. What, then, may not be achieved if it actually acts with real courage?
 
 SYMPATHY FROM NATAL CONGRESS
 A telegram has been received from the Natal Indian Congress exhorting the Indian community to adhere to the gaol resolution and promising monetary aid. This expression of sympathy is very useful. But the time is such that whatever monetary aid is intended to be given should be sent immediately. No doubt, money will be required in plenty if the Indian community ventures upon a really bold course.

           TO THE 	EDITOR       JOHANNESBURG,  July 	6, 1907 
 [RAND 	DAILY MAIL] SIR,  	I trust I need not offer any apology for reverting to the Asiatic 	question. I did not say to your interviewerlibtech_78_footnotelibtech_79_footnotethat 	“passive resistance” was a new way to my compatriots. What I did 	say was that it was not possible for me to forecast the result, as 	we had been for generations unused to it, especially on a large 	scale. I, personally, feel proud to notice that the faculty of 	suffering for the common good has only lain dormant, and that, under 	stress of circumstances, it is being again quickened into life. 	Picketing is by no means a new thing to the Indian mind. The network 	of castes in India simply illustrates the use and value of that 	weapon, provided that it is rightly used. Ostracism and 	excommunication are the most powerful instruments resorted to today 	in India, in unfortunately trivial matters, and, if the Registration 	Act now enables my countrymen to realize the use of that terrible 	weapon for a higher purpose, both Lord Elgin and the Transvaal 	Government will have deserved their gratitude. There 	is, of course, therefore, nothing strange in  Indian pickets,    Indian 	Opinion, 13-7-1907.  
 with (for them) rare self-sacrifice and courage, endeavouring to show their ignorant or weakly brethren the path of duty. At the same time, there is just as much difference today between Western pickets and Eastern, or, rather, Indian, as there is, apparently, between West and East. We have no desire to terrorise. We do not wish to compel obedience to the wish of the majority, but, like the indomitable Salvation Army lasses, we do, in our humble manner, wish with all the persuasive power of which we may be capable to inform those who do not know of what is held to be the right view of the Asiatic Registrationlibtech_80_footnotelibtech_81_footnoteAct. It is, then, left open to such men either to accept the advice that may be given by us, or to accept the degrading Act and to sell themselves for a miserable existence in this country. As I have said before, if the Colonists knew what the Act means, they would themselves call such Indians as obeyed it curs fit only to be kicked and despised.
 You quote, I take it for the benefit of the Indian community, Mr. Henry’s remarks on the use of finger-prints in India. Their use, however, has never been denied. It is the abuse of the system against which I have ventured, in common with my fellow-countrymen, to protest.
 You hope that wiser counsels will prevail among my country- men, and that they will submit to the Act. I, on the other hand, hope that, if my countrymen rise to the occasion and are prepared  to sacrifice everything rather than their honour and self-respect, you will change your views and respect them as men of their word. Let me remind you that Indians have sworn before God that they will not submit to the law. Perjury before a Court of Law can be expiated by suffering punishment that may be awarded by a judge. What expiation is possible before the Judge of Judges, who never errs? If we perjured ourselves before Him, we would then indeed be unfit associates for any civilised body of men, and the ghettos of old will be our proper and deserved lot.

                TO  THE 	EDITOR 	THE STAR [JOHANNSBURG] SIR,           P. O. BOX 	57, PRETORIA, 	July 7, 1907 
  	Your Pretoria correspondent has given the Indian community deserved 	credit by saying that “no serious troubles are anticipated” with 	reference to the struggle of British Indians in this Colony not to 	submit to the Asiatic Registration Act. The Attorney-General, too, 	paid us a compliment by saying that he did not expect the 	law-abiding Indians to resist the enforcement of the law. The only 	difference is that the lawabiding instinct, while it makes rioting 	and physical resistance impossible, does not involve acceptance of 	any measure, however distasteful. That instinct tells us that, if we 	cannot bear the yoke imposed by the law, we must suffer the 	consequences of its breach with quiet dignity and resignation.  	Your correspondent threatens that, if my countrymen do not change 	their attitude, the penal clauses will be rigorously enforced and 	they will be deported. This threat was unnecessary, for we have cou- 	nted the consequence of non-submission. Gaol has no terrors for us 	compared to the enforced slavery of the Registration Act, which puts 	on the whole community a brand of criminality. Deportation will be a 	welcome relief from the contemplation of a dog’s life in what we 	have been taught to consider our own home. If the Act bears as 	heavily on us as we represent it to do, no sacrifice will be too 	great for us.  	We are having a unique experience of Imperialism and the cos- 	mopolitan  nature  of   the Empire. The Imperial arm is presumed to 	cover the weak from the strong. Indians of the Transvaal are now 	waiting to see whether that arm is to protect the weak Indians from 	the strong whites—British and otherwise—or whether it is to be 	used to strengthen the hands of the tyrant to crush the weak and 	helpless. Pardon the use of the word, but is it not tyrannical to 	disregard every sentiment and our religions, for this is no question 	of regulating immigration? The principle of registration we have 	accepted; the manner of it we bitterly resent. But the Government 	wish to impose 
 studied humiliation. Are Indians to blame if, rather than suffer it, they are prepared to lose their earthly possessions? If the whole of the white Transvaal be against us, God is with us.

 Monday, [July 8, 1907]
 WELL DONE, PRETORIA !
 Pretoria has done exceedingly well. Especially those from whom courage was hardly expected have borne tremendous suffering and neglected their own business in order to be ready for public service. Indians are thinking of nothing but how their honour may be defended.
 ALL PRAISE TO VOLUNTEERS
 The volunteers, pickets or watchmen, or patriotic workers [what ever name we may use] have earned glory for  themselves.  Their names will go down for all time in the history of the Transvaal Indians. They devote all their time to keeping a watch. Their names are as under: Messrs A. M. Cachalia, Gavarishankar Pranshankar Vyas, Gulam Mahomed Abdul Rashid, Cassim Sidoo, Khushal Chhita, Memon Ebrahim Noor, Govind Prag, Hossen Biba, Mahomed Valli, Ardeshir Framji, Chaool Beg, Gulab Rudra Desai, Moosa Suliman and Ebrahim Noor. These patriots go round the Permit Office by turns throughout the day, and if they find any Indian going there, they persuade him courteously and stop him. At present they have given up their private business and plunged into the service of the motherland. They do not care for the dangers they may have to face. They are quite prepared to suffer what ever consequences may follow. It would not at all be surprising if such patriotism should lead to ultimate success.
 LESSON FROM THEIR COURAGE
 The work of these volunteers must be emulated everywhere in the Transvaal. Officials will shortly be appointed  everywhere  to receive applications for new registers. As at Pretoria, Indians at all the other places will then have to look for volunteers. I advise them to
 build the bund in time before the coming of the flood, and keep volunteers ready. Those who can should visit Pretoria and see how thoroughly the work is being done there. If the boycott of the Permit Office is successful, the struggle to follow is likely to be easier.
 SUGGESTION TO MERCHANTS
 I am told that some merchants who have been importing goods from England and other places have stopped doing so on account of the new law. Such merchants deserve congratulations. It appears they are fully prepared for the worst hardship, that is, the hardship of imprisonment. If every merchant should write or send cables to his creditor to this effect, I think it may do much good. In the first place, the merchant who does so will himself feel bolder and, in the second place, the merchants in Europe will get alarmed and they themselves will begin working for us. All this can be done only by those  merchants who are inspired with patriotism, who have a clear idea of the harm that may be done to us by the obnoxious law and have full faith in God.
     Star: libtech_82_footnote  IMMIGRATION 	BILL On 	this Bill, Mr. Gandhi has written the following letter to The    REGULATIONS 	FOR HAWKERS  	The Regulations concerning hawkers, which I mentioned earlier, 
  	have been passed. Johannesburg hawkers should therefore wake up 	before they get fined. For the Regulations, please refer to previous 	issues of this journal.  ARREST 	OF INDIAN  	A telegram from Potchefstroom states that Hajee Omar of that place 	has been arrested on charges of fraud and burning his shop. The bail 	fixed for him is £1,500. 
    MORE 	INFORMATION 	ABOUT OBNOXIOUS 	ACT  Tuesday 
  	Lengthy articles have begun appearing in the Rand Daily Mail and 	the Leader. They state that Indians in Pretoria are not 	getting themselves registered because of pressure from Johannesburg 	Indians. The papers add that, during the last days of July, everyone 	will go to the Permit Office to give the finger-prints. We want 	Pretoria Indians to remain firm and prove thereby that this report 	is a libel. If, ultimately,    
 people should invade the Pretoria Office like swarms of locusts, all the good work done will be undone.
 REFLECTION ON THIS
 The Indian community has now to exercise great caution. I hear from many places that, as soon as the leaders are arrested, the peoplewill get themselves registered out of fear. If that is to happen, it will be, as the Indian proverb has it, like the case of a woman who went in search of a son and lost her husband. This is no time for depending upon leaders or anyone else. Everyone is to rely on his own courage. In this situation, neither lawyers nor anyone else can be of any help. When we are all involved in the conflagration, it is no use looking to one another for help. I hear that the Government will be soon laying its hands on Mr. Gandhi and, perhaps, on some other leaders also. If this happens, instead of being put out by their going to gaol, the people should welcome it and be inspired to greater courage. The truth is that we are not sheep, but free men, and we would not depend upon other people for help. The confusion in our mind will disappear only if we are convinced that a gaol is not something to be afraid of. God is our only shield, and we should all bear in mind that we are to rush into the thick of the battle with this shield in hand.
 “I SHALL TAKE IT OUT IF OTHERS DO”
 Many whites have been offering advice to Indians. When the former ask ‘What will you do?’, many Indians say in reply, ‘We shall do what our leaders do.’ Some answer, ‘We shall do what others do.’ These are words of cowards, and they will do harm. Everyone should give the reply: ‘I dislike the law and so I will never submit to it. Moreover, I will not submit to it also because I have taken an oath in the name of God. I would rather go to gaol than submit to the law which would make a slave of me.’ He who cannot give this answer will never reach the other shore. None can swim with another’s buoy. We are to swim with our own strength. Will the reader  swallow  dust because I choose to do so? Will he fall into a pit because I do so? Will he forsake his religion because I do so? I may stand my mother’s humiliation, turn my sons into thieves, and have the fingers of myself and of my sons cut off; will the reader do likewise? Everyone will answer ‘Never!’ In a similar spirit, everyone should answer, ‘I don’t care what others do, but I for my part will not submit to the law.’ All do not give such straightforward answers, and that is why the newspapers make this comment that, though we seem  to  be enthusiastic now, we shall in the end unhitch our waggons. Everyone has to think over all this. This is no time for fear or secrecy. We have
 nothing to hide and keep silent about. We have to display  our courage, as the sun does its splendour.
 STRENGTH OF CHINESE
 Last Sunday, the Chinese held a meeting, to which they invited Mr. Polak. After Mr. Polak had explained the position, they too reaffirmed their resolve that no Chinese would submit to the law, and anyone doing so would be excommunicated.
 ASIATIC EATING-HOUSES
 The Town Council of Johannesburg intends to make a regulation that only a white can become the manager of an Asiatic eating-house. Does this mean that, at Hindu and Muslim eating-houses in the Transvaal, the whites will serve and the Indians merely watch? All this will apply to those who accept the title-deed of slavery. No one will be able to lay his hands on those who refuse to touch it.

 THE PETITION OF THE ACTING CHAIRMAN OF THE BRITISH INDIAN ASSOCIATION OF THE TRANSVAAL
HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT:
    Your 			Petitioner has 			been desired by 			the Committee 			of the 			British Indian 			Association to 			approach this 			Hon’ble House in 			connection with 			the Immigration 			Restriction Bill now 			under consideration.  While 			the said Association ventures to approve 			of the 			principle of the 			measure, in its humble 			opinion, from 			an Indian 			standpoint, some of its features are open to serious objection, namely:   
  The 	Bill in 	question does 	not recognize 	Indian languages, 	which have a vast literature.  It 	does not 	recognize the 	claim of 	those who 	have been 	formerly domiciled in 	the Transvaal. 	(Many British Indians 
 who paid £3, under Law 3 of 1885 as amended in 1886, before 1899, for settling in the country, but who are now out of the Colony and who have not received permits under the Peace Preservation Ordinance, are by the Bill  in question prohibited from re-entering the country, unless they possess the educational qualifications contemplated by the Bill.)
  Clause 	4 of 	Section 2, 	as it has been 	interpreted to 	the said 	Association, makes it 	practically impossible even for British Indians 	with high 	educational attainments 	to enter the 	Transvaal, unless they 	comply with the terms 	of the 	Asiatic Registration 	Act. (In the 	humble opinion of 	 the Association, 	those who pass the 	education test 	imposed by 	the Bill need 	hardly furnish 	further identification 	for purposes 	of immigration.)  As 	interpreted to 	the Association, 	the said 	Clause 4 ranks 	British Indians 	with people 	affected by 	the Immorality 	Ordinance, and 	is therefore 	considered by 	the British Indian community to be highly offensive.libtech_83_footnote  The 	Bill in 	question, contrary to 	expectation, perpetuates 	the Asiatic Registration Act. 
    The 			said Association 			humbly ventures to 			draw the 			attention of 			this Hon’ble House 			to the 			fact that British 			Indians are not 			represented therein, 			and that, therefore, 			they may 			respectfully claim 			additional 			consideration from 			this Hon’ble House.  In 			conclusion, the 			said Association 			trusts that the 			petition will 			receive due 			consideration, and 			that such relief will 			be granted 			as may 			be possible 			in the circumstances.

41,"July 11, 1907",NEW TRANSVAAL IMMIGRATION BILL,"
        
 [Before July 11, 1907] This Bill has not yet become an Act. But it can be seen from the
Bill what the Government’s intentions are; we therefore give below a
summary of it:
  The 	Permit Act 	[the Peace Preservation 	Ordinance, 1903] is 	repealed, provided that 	such repeal shall 	not affect or 	abridge any 	of the 	powers conferred under 	the Asiatic 	Registration Act.  After 	the taking effect of 	the Bill, the following 	classes of persons 	will be treated 	as prohibited immigrants: 
  Any 	person without 	a good knowledge 	of a 	European language.  Any 	person who 	has not in his 	possession or 	at his disposal 	means to support himself.  Any 	prostitute or 	person procuring 	women for 	immoral purposes.  Any 	person who 	under any 	law in force 	at the 	date of 	his entering 	or attempting 	to enter 	the Transvaal 	will be liable, 	if found therein, to be removed 	therefrom for failure 	 to comply with its provisions.  Lunatics 	or lepers 	or those 	suffering from 	such contagious 	diseases.  Any 	person about whom 	a report 	may have been received 	from the 	Imperial Government 	or from 	any other 	official source 	that he is undesirable.  Any 	person who 	in the opinion of 	the Government 	is dangerous 	to the 	peace, order and 	good government 	of the 	Colony.  This 	Bill will not apply 	to the 	wife or 	minor child of 	any person 	who is 	not a 	prohibited immigrant, 	and it 	will also 	not apply 	to Kaffirs 	and to 	European workers 
  For 	administering this 	law, an Immigration 	Department will be 	set up.  For 	enforcing this 	law, the Governor will 	have the authority to 	enter into agreement 	with the Government 	of any Colony.  Every 	prohibited immigrant 	entering or found 	within this Colony shall 	be liable 	to a 	fine not 	exceeding £100 	or imprisonment 	for a 	period not 	exceeding six 	months, and 	to be removed 	at any 	time from 	the Colony.  Any 	person who 	violates the 	Immorality Ordinance 	[1903] or 	who may be 	deemed to 	be dangerous to 	the peace, 	order and good government of 	the Colony 	may be 	arrested and 	removed from 	the Colony.  Anyone 	who aids or 	abets a prohibited 	immigrant in 	entering the 	Colony will be 	liable to 	a fine 	not exceeding 	£100 or 	to imprisonment 	not exceeding 	six months.  No 	prohibited immigrant 	will be 	entitled to 	obtain a 	licence or 	to acquire any 	interest in 	land in 	the Colony.  Every 	person suspected to 	be a prohibited 	immigrant may be 	arrested without a warrant. Ignorance 	of this 	Act will 	be no defence.  Any 	person ordered 	to be removed 	from this Colony shall 	be liable to pay 	all expenditure 	incurred by the 	Government in 	 carrying out 	such removal, which may 	be recovered 	from the property 	of the 	person concerned.  The 	name, permanent 	residence, place of 	birth, etc., of 	eve- ry 	person putting up 	at a hotel 	shall be recorded 	by the 	hotel-keeper, and the Government will have the authority to inspect the same.  The 	burden of 	proving that 	he is not a 	prohibited immigrant 	shall lie upon 	the accused.  Every 	magistrate shall have jurisdiction 	to impose 	the maximum 	penalties for all 	contraventions of 	this Act. 
 IMPLICATIONS OF BILL
 This is a frightful Bill. The Imperial Government is likely to be deceived by it. Superficially viewed, the Bill is harmless, but on closer scrutiny it is found to be poisonous. The Bill entirely abolishes the rights of refugees without permits. Those who hold permits but go out of the Transvaal, without getting the permits exchanged under the new Act, lose their right to return.
 The educated Indian is granted a right with one hand and dep- rived of it with the other. For, those entering on the strength of their knowledge of a European language will have, under this obnoxious Bill, to give their finger-prints within eight days of immigration and to take out a permit, failing which they will be deported.
Thus, the Indian is not likely to be benefited at all by this Bill.
 The Bill will have to be sent to Lord Elgin for approval. In that case, the Indian community will have to put up a fight in England. More information about the Bill will be available between the writing
 of this and the date of its publication, i.e., on Thursday, the 11th instant. We shall be able to publish it in the next issue.

[MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,]
 I have your letter. I note what you say about Kajee. Mr. Polak has just returned from Pretoria. He has done exceedingly well there. I have written to Mr. Westlibtech_85_footnoteabout jobs. The Customs Forms, as I have said to Mr. West, are to be sent to the address in your possession of Ebrahim Mahomed. He is one of the subscribers.
 I am certain that it is a short-sighted policy not to print Hindi. We are really not even using our capital. Ramayana is bound to sell, and, in my opinion, it will be a work of very considerable merit, for the simple reason that thousands of people who cannot possibly study the whole work will gladly avail themselves of the condensation. If, therefore, a good man is available, you should certainly not hesitate to incur the expense. The reasoning which tells you that, according to the expenses here, the book will be dear is faulty to a degree. It should be plain to us that, if the expenses are high, the prices charged are correspondingly high. The term high, therefore, is merely relative. The Bhagavad-Gitalibtech_86_footnotelibtech_87_footnote, which we would issue in India for one anna, we charge one shilling for, because the expenses  were  comparatively high. I am perfectly certain that whenever we think of having things done cheaply outside the country of our adoption, we bring into play the ordinary weakness, namely, to drive the hardest bargain possible, and it is for that reason that I have condemned in my mind the idea of having the South African booklibtech_88_footnotelibtech_89_footnoteprinted in Bombay, and I feel this so

44,,MEASURE OF INDIAN STRENGTH,"
 Gujarati 	postscript in Gandhiji’s hand: S. N. 4757             	Till now the strength of the Indian community has not been tested. 	It has remained a secret hidden in a closed fist, as it were, and no 	one has taken its measure. The prevailing idea is that Indians are 	cowardly and lacking in spirit.  	But, by good fortune, the community’s strength is now being tested 	in the Transvaal. This opportunity is given to us by Lord Elgin    
 tested in the Transvaal. This opportunity is given to us by Lord Elgin and General Botha and their friends. In this trial of strength the community has proved its superiority, up to the time of writing this, at any rate. The news-letters published by us show that Pretoria, which hitherto the whites had thought to be weak, has all of a sudden shown itself to be quite strong, not a single Indian there taking out the obnoxious permit. A Madrasi went to the Permit Office, but when he found that finger-prints were required, he threw away his application and said that he would not give his finger-prints on any account. The Madrasi Postmaster preferred to resign his post rather than take out the new permit. We hear that Mr. Chamney’s Punjabi attendant flatly refused to take out the new permit. All this shows that the Indian people would not be found wanting when weighed in the balance.
 Who can harm one whom God protects? The Indian people are religious-minded. They believe in God. He will easily bring success in any work we undertake with full faith in Him. It is said that, because of his faith in God, Narasinha Mehtalibtech_92_footnotecould fulfil his social obligation on the occasion of the first pregnancy of his daughter, though he had no money of his own.libtech_93_footnoteWith  God’s  help,  Prophet  Mahomed  came through greathardships and subdued his opponents. The same Creator will help the Indian community.
 The eyes of Indians everywhere are at present fixed on their countrymen in the Transvaal. They are all eager to know whether the community will succeed in the challenge that they have taken up. Pretoria’s answer is that the Indian community shall never turn back.

 "
45,,DUTY OF DURBAN,"
        
 Is there any Indian who will not be thrilled with joy at Pretoria’s performance and at the courage of Indian pickets there? It is easy to offer congratulations. But true congratulation consists in doing likewise. Durban should begin a boycott of the Permit Office like the one that is going on in the Transvaal. Even a single Indian now
 
 entering the Transvaal from Durban will be like a microbe getting into milk. This is a time when the Transvaal Indians ought to sacrifice all their worldly possessions. If any Indian is specially keen on going to the Transvaal, it will not be with a view to offering help, but only on personal business. Such Indians will demoralize others by going to the Transvaal, rather than add to their strength. Moreover, these Indians can enter the Transvaal only by going to the Durban Permit Office. That will mean a break-down of the boycott. But if no Indian at all goes to the Durban Permit Office for a permit, the Office cannot run. It is therefore essential that Durban Indians follow the example of Pretoria.
 The Natal Indian Congress has intimated its offer of monetary aid to their brethren in the Transvaal. It held a mass meeting which has infused spirit into them. It has also taken up the question of raising contributions. This is certainly admirable. But in addition, it is necessary to take up the question of boycotting the Durban Permit Office. There are three ways of doing it. First, pickets should  be posted at the Durban Office to prevent Indians from going there. Second, a watch should be kept on the Indians proceeding by train to the Transvaal, and if any such Indian is going there with a new permit, or with an old permit without at the same time being ready to go to gaol, he should be dissuaded from going further. Third, it should be seen that no Indian gives his finger-prints on board a steamer. By doing all this, Durban will have given very good help and brought our deliverance nearer.

 Mr. Gandhi gave a brief resume of the position of affairs to date, and once more exhorted his hearers to resist the inequitous provisions of the new law to the last, and under no circumstances to re-register under compulsion.

 PRETORIA’S HONOUR
 Pretoria is still going strong. Its honour has been preserved, and it has come out unscathed through the second week. Mr. Cody, the Permit Officer, has had “a holiday” for another week, and the brave watchmen, i.e., the volunteers, have earned glory for themselves. Thewhites have been taken aback and wonder what it all means. They ask whether Indians, who used to take insults lying down, will now stand up twirling their moustaches. Some English ladies inquired of Indian hawkers selling vegetables whether they would take out permits. The brave hawkers invariably gave an emphatic “no” in reply. If this spirit is maintained to the very end, Indian prestige will go up, and the new law will receive a knock-over. Everyone will agree that the credit for it should go to Pretoria Indians and the pickets.
 WHITE’S MISCHIEF
 I hear that an agent of Mr. Stephen Frazer has been specially touring the country and telling things to Indians which might frighten
 
 them. To the Pietersburg Indians he held out the threat that, if the Indian community followed Mr. Gandhi’s advice and refused to submit to the new law, it would be ruined and the property of the persons concerned confiscated by the Government. As the last date approaches, there will doubtless be more such frauds practised on us by hostile or selfish whites. I should point out that it is the duty of every Indian to give a smashing reply to such people. Indians do not have even time to listen to cowardly advice. To say  that  the Government will confiscate property is an utter lie. There is no authority under which it can do so. As for being ruined, we know that Mr. Hajee Habib has already written about it to The Star. He has made the point that, though we may be ruined, we shall have saved our honour and earned the reputation of being true to our pledge. The truth therefore is that we are opposing the law not because of Mr. Gandhi’s advice, but because we mean to defend our manhood. If we have that, we shall create wealth out of nothing. If on the contrary, we behave like women, though being men, we shall find it difficult to preserve what we have, and shall have no peace of mind to enjoy what we save. Richard III, a former king of England, came to the throne after killing his kinsmen. But he could not enjoy it in peace. He shook with fear whenever he held in his hand the sword stained with the blood of his kinsmen. In the end, he died a cruel and unnatural death. What Indian is there who will, out of greed, injure the interest of all, unmindful of the humiliation of his brethren? If there is any such person, he will but die like King Richard in anguish and remorse. I wish that the Indian community will, in this crisis, spurn such advisers with white faces and black hearts.
 TWO OTHER WHITES
 If Mr. Stephen Frazer’s agent talked disgracefully as above, two other whites, who are respectable merchants carrying on a large busi-ness with Indians, speak reasonably and admit that, for the sake  of its good name, the Indian community ought to stand by its resolve to go to gaol and that, if all remain firm in it, they will undoubtedly succeed. Some might say that this “if” is a big thing. But the “if” is big only for a coward. The courageous will take others to be courageous too and they will only believe that the Indian community will fully keep its pledge on this occasion.
 JOHANNESBURG MEETING
 A very large meeting was held last Sunday in the hall of the Hamidia Islamic Society. The meeting was to begin at 2.30 p.m., but the hall was fully packed before that hour. Those who could not get in stood outside. Many had come from Germiston also. Haffejee Abdul
 Samad took the chair. After Mr. Fancy had read out the minutes, Mr. Gandhi explained the position about the obnoxious law. Then Mr. Ram Sundar Pundit from Germiston made an eloquent and impassioned speech. He said that at Germiston the people were in high spirits. Volunteers were also ready and Germiston would do exactly what Pretoria had done. In Pretoria volunteers had displayed fine patriotism. Mr. Emam Abdool Cadir said that no Asiatic whatever could submit to the law in question. He also described the fervour he had himself witnessed at the Pretoria meeting. Mr. Nawab Khan said that no Indian, whatever his position, could accept the law. If the women of England were strong enough to go to gaol, would the men among the Indian people be scared by having to go to gaol or by having to suffer other losses? Mr. Abdur Rehman said that the Indian community at Potchefstroom was very firm. They had been told by Mr. Stephen Frazer’s agent that goods would be supplied to them on credit only if they promised to submit to the law. To that Mr. Rehman had given the answer that the slavery of the law was unacceptable to Indians, even if a thousand Stephen Frazers should stop giving them goods on credit. He added that the Potchefstroom traders would put up with any amount of loss, but would not submit to the obnoxious law.
 In a very forceful speech, Mr. Omarji quoted the Gujarati verse beginning, “O true one! Swerve not from the path of truth.” Thereafter, Messrs Shahboodeen and Cama put some questions. The meeting then terminated. There was no one at the meeting who appeared to have the slightest intention of submitting to the law. Mr. Polak also addressed the meeting and praised the volunteers whom he had seen at Pretoria.
 MEETING OF WAITERS
 At the Ebenezer School, Mr. David Ernest had convened a meeting of the members of the Transvaal Football Association. About 50  waiters attended it. The meeting took place on  Monday at 3.30
   Mr. 		Gandhi explained 		the position 		about the law. Mr. 		Naidoo interpreted 		in Tamil. 		Finally Mr. 		Polak spoke. He 		told a 		story. Once 		upon a 		time there was 		an animal. 		It had 		this peculiar 		characteristic, that 		if its head was 		cut off, two would growl in its place. 		 Thus, whenever 		its head 		was cut off, 		it would 		be left 		with double the number 		of heads. When people 		came to know 		of this, 		they stopped troubling 		the animal. 		The Indian 		community had to 		behave in 		a similar 		manner. There 		should be no waiting 		for anybody’s 		leadership. It 		should be 		assumed that everyone 		was a 		leader. In 		the place 		of one 		Indian gaoled 		or deported, two should come out to take up leadership and brave the  
 sentence of gaol or deportation. If this happened, the Government could not but be defeated. The waiters should realize that they were men first and servants next, and accordingly they must oppose the law firmly without being afraid of losing their employment.
 Mr. David, who is a Government interpreter, said that he had given a flat refusal when the Government asked him to get himself registered,
 Then, on Mr. Gandhi putting it to the meeting, everyone stood up and replied that he would not seek registration, even if that meant losing his job. The meeting terminated at 4.45 p.m.
 GERMISTON MEETING
 The Indians at Germiston are in high spirits. Pundit Ram Sundar Maharaj has placed himself at their head, working fearlessly, and exhorting the people. They held a special meeting and resolved that, no matter what risks awaited them, they would not submit to the law. More than 200 men signed the resolution, and some brave men came forward to serve as volunteers, as had happened at Pretoria.
 IMMIGRATION BILL
 The second reading of the Immigration Bill is over. Mr. Smuts clarified  the  aims  of  the  Bill.  Messrs  Hosken,   Lindsay,  Wyberghlibtech_97_footnotelibtech_98_footnote, Neser and Whiteside participated in the discussion. Mr. Hosken, speaking on the Indian side, said that the new Bill  would  be appropriate only in Russia. The Bill contained some provisions which ought to have no place under British rule.
 ASSOCIATION’S PETITION
 The Association has submitted a petitionlibtech_99_footnoteagainst this Bill. This has already been printed in our English section. Below is a summary of it:
 Though this Association is not opposed to the principle of restricting immigration, it respectfully submits the following objec- tions: (a) The Bill does not recognize any Indian language. (b) It does not protect the rights of those who have been residents of the Transvaal for a long time. For instance, many Indians had paid £3 to the Boer Government for the right of settling in the Transvaal. Some of them have not received permits. The rights of such persons would be annulled in case they did not know one of the European languages. (c) Under sub-section 4 of Section 2, even those Asiatics
 
 who may pass the educational test and are not otherwise prohibited are subjected to the operation of the new Asiatic law. No purpose is served by applying the law in this manner, as Indians of educational attainments do not require further identification. (d) Under the same section, moreover, the Indian community is bracketed with prostitutes and their touts. (e) Contrary to former assurances, this Bill confirms the provisions of the Asiatic Registration Act.
 Parliament should remember that the Asiatic communities are not represented on it. It is therefore its special duty to pay attention to the petition of the community. The Association therefore prays and hopes that its petition will receive full consideration and relief will be granted.
 The petition was presented by Mr. Hosken. The Bill will be examined by the Select Committee on Wednesday. I am writing this letter on Monday, and it will be known before this issue is published if any changes are made in it.
 WILL NEWSPAPERS BE AVAILABLE IN PRISON?
 This question has been asked by a correspondent. The answer is that it all depends on the kind of gaol sentence given. If it is a  sentence of rigorous imprisonment, no newspaper will be provided, but every prisoner will be allowed to be visited by his friends once a month. I would advise such visitors to carry in their mind the information published in Indian Opinion and convey it  to  the prisoner himself in the gaol-palace.
 DISMISSED UNCEREMONIOUSLY
 A few Indian friends at Pretoria thought that, if they placed some demands before the Colonial Government and if the demands were granted, they would be saved from the trouble of going to gaol. But God means to test us to the utmost. Hence, nothing came out of the demands. The following demands were placed before Mr. Smuts by these Indians:
   They 			should not be 			required to 			give ten digit-impressions, The 			mother’s name 			should not 			be required,  Registration 			should be 			required only in 			the case  of grown-up 			children, the younger 			ones being 			spared the 			harassment.  The 			Kaffir police should 			not have 			the power 			to examine 			[the permits].  The 			distinction made 			between the Christians 			and the 			Muslims of 			Turkey should be dropped.  The 			name of 			the Orange 			River Colony should continue 			to be 			mentioned in 			the permit.  The 			determination of 			the age of 			a minor 			should not 			be left 			to the 			arbitrary decision of 			the Registrar, 			but should 			be left 			to the court.  Temporary 			permits should be 			freely available for 			the entry of 			merchants’ employees.  An 			assurance should 			be given 			that this legislation 			is now 			final.   
 Mr. Smuts has sent a long reply. It is very ingenious. If we could be killed with sweet words, he would kill us. He says  that  the obligation to give one’s mother’s name will be withdrawn if all Indians get themselves registered. The Kaffir police will not ask for finger-prints (which means that they may ask for the permit). Whether this law will be the last of its kind or not depends on the Indian community itself. If the community carries out the provisions of the law faithfully, there will perhaps be, says Mr. Smuts, no further legislation.
 BLOOD BOILS
 As I summarize this reply, my blood boils. What is meant by saying that there would be no further restrictions if we behaved well? After reducing us to a living death under the obnoxious law, could there be a fresh amendment in order to kick at the dead? It should be noted that on no single point has Mr. Smuts given up his obstinacy. For he does not say categorically that the mention of the mother’s name will not be required. If all Indians agree to registration, it will be left to our discretion whether that sacred name should be mentioned or not. The Native police will not ask for the finger-prints, that is, they may certainly ask for permits. If we submitted to the new law, we would never be able to escape the music of “Your pass, please.”
 IT IS ALSO GOOD
 But it is also good that we have been given such a stunning blow with a stick wrapped in silk. Now the Indian community will become still more determined. Just as the Regulations under a cruel law were bound to be cruel, the reply had also to be cruel. The cruel Regulations have inflamed the Indians. This cruel reply will make them inflexible. With God as our witness, we have pledged opposition to the law. With the same God as witness, let us prove our courage.
 CORRECTION
I thank the correspondent who has pointed out that I made a
 mistake in giving the name of the volunteer who was awarded a shawl by Mr. Essop Mia. It was to Gulam Mahomed that the shawl was awarded. I apologize to Mr. Gulam Mahomed for the mistake.

TO
 THE HON’BLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PRETORIA
SIR,
 I am desired by the Committee of my Association to draw the attention   of   the   Government   to   the   petitionlibtech_102_footnoteof   the   Association submitted to the Hon’ble the Legislative [Assembly on the subject of the]libtech_103_footnoteImmigration Restriction Bill. The points raised therein are, in the humble opinion of my Association, of the utmost importance to the community represented by my Association. If relief were granted as prayed, my Association ventures to think that the principle of the Bill would still remain intact.
 My Association fails to see any reason for requiring well-educated Indians to comply with the Registration Act,  and  it seems a very serious injustice to deprive British Indians, who have paid
 £3 for the purpose of settling in the Transvaal, but who have not received permits under the Peace Preservation Ordinance, of the right of returning to the country of their adoption.
 
 
 My Association, therefore, trusts that the Government will be pleased to give a favourable consideration to the prayer of my Asso- ciation.
 I have, etc.,

50,,A GROSS LIBEL,"
        
 Further correspondence on the Asiatic Act of the Transvaal, placed on the Table at the instance of Lord Ampthill, has now come to hand. Lord Selborne, in pressing the measure on the attention of Lord Elgin, allowed himself to make the following remarks:
 I hope that it may be possible for you to inform me at an early date that His Majesty will not be advised to exercise his power of disallowance in respect of this Act, so that it may be possible to bring it into force at once, and so to check the illicit unauthorized influx of Asiatics into the Transvaal which is at present proceeding at an alarming rate.
The italics are Ours.
 We have no hesitation in saying that the emphatic pronoun- cement made by Lord Selborne as to the illicit influx is a libel, pure and simple. Here there is no qualification. His Lordship has accepted the statements placed before him as to the unauthorized influx of Asiatics without any reservation whatsoever, and yet these statements could only have been one-sided. Indians have denied any such influx and they have challenged investigation.libtech_104_footnoteNone has been made; still, Lord Selborne has seen fit, in spite of the tremendous responsibility resting on his shoulders, to give the imprimatur of his authority to an unproved charge.
 This charge is inherently untrue. If such an influx has been proceeding demonstrably, why have the entrants been allowed to remain in the Colony? Either His Lordship’s informants knew of the men who had so entered, or they did not. If they knew, the Peace Preservation Ordinance supplied all the machinery necessary to bring
 
 them to justice. Lord Selborne’s libel, therefore, shows how difficult, if not impossible, it is for Asiatics to get even a fair hearing in South Africa, except in courts of justice. In a matter such as this the courts are not open to them, so they have to sit still, and grin and bear their troubles as best they may.
 When we come to examine Lord Elgin’s reply, it is sufficient to fill British Indians with dismay. The Secretary of State for  the  Colonies has sanctioned the measure, not because he believes it to be just, but because there is behind it the weight of white authority. So it comes to this, that any Act of a Colonial Parliament, if it is unanimous, will bind the Imperial Government, irrespective of the merits of that Act, and if this proposition be unimpeachable, Lord Elgin’s statement, that “His Majesty’s Government adhere to the opinion as to the desirability of recasting the restrictions to which Asiatics are at present subject”, is a pious wish by which British Indians cannot set much store. It may never fructify, whilst the Act stands before Asiatics in the Transvaal as a stern reality, to fight against which they have staked their all. General Botha’s promises to revise the Regulations do not affect Indians very much, but incidentally it may be remarked, as a symptom of the very strong prejudice permeating the local Government, that the General has not been able to fulfil  those promises. Indian sentiment counts for little in the deliberations of the Colonial Government.

 "
51,,THE TRANSVAAL IMMIGRATION BILL DEBATE,"
        
 The debate that took place on the second reading of the Immigration Restriction Bill in the Transvaal Assembly is in many respects an eye-opener. Mr. Smuts introduced the Bill to the House in  a most summary manner. Points that affect British Indians were hardly touched by the Honourable Gentleman. He did not even consider them sufficiently interesting for the members of the public. He took it as a settled fact that the Asiatic Registration Act  should  be  a permanent feature of the Transvaal laws, and that, contrary to what Mr.  Duncan   saidlibtech_105_footnoteat   the   time   of   introducing   that   measure,   the Immigration Bill is not to supersede it but to supplement it in its harshness, so far as the Asiatic communities are concerned. He did not trouble to inform the Members that Law 3 of 1885, which guaranteed
 
 residential protection to Asiatics who paid £3 to the Boer Government, is to be overridden by the Bill, and he saw nothing untoward in the clause which makes an Asiatic a prohibited immigrant if, in spite of the possession by him of high educational attainments, he fails, on entering the Colony, to undergo the ordeal prescribed by the Asiatic Registration Act.
 In reply to Mr. Neser’s gentle suggestion that the clause in the Bill giving extraordinary powers to the Government to eject, at his own expense, any person from the Colony, without a trial, was rather a dangerous thing, Mr. Wybergh showed the greatest resentment. The latter’sremarks, however, we can only characterize as foolishness due to self-forgetfulness. In any other person, it would be grossest impertinence. In discussing the clause and in asking the Government to hold on to it, he cited recent events in India. We do not wish to enter into the merits of the controversy, but we do expect a responsible politician like Mr. Wybergh not to speak from his seat in the Legislative Assembly to the South African public in a most irresponsible manner. Unless he has made Indian questions a special study, it is evident that he can only know what the cabled summaries of events have let the world know, and unless he believes in  the inherent infallibility of all governments, he had no right to consider that the action of the authorities in deporting Indian leaders was either in itself good or that it had produced a sobering effect. We may, perhaps, claim to know a little more than the Honourable Member, and yet, not being in close touch with what is happening in that part of the British Empire, we have deemed it wise not to comment.
 To add to the folly, Mr. Wybergh went on to deduce from the events in India that the powers given by the clause might be useful for sending out Indian inciters to passive resistance in the  Transvaal. Herein he betrayed a lack of all perspective. Happenings in India have received the colour of an insurrection, and they have been interpreted to mean a revolt against the British Raj. The crusade of the Indians in the Transvaal has not the slightest resemblance to an insurrectionary movement. It simply means an offer on the part of the community to suffer much physical hardship rather than allow its moral sense to be atrophied. It is, on the part of Indians in the Transvaal, an endeavour to follow the precept of the Prophet of Nazareth, “Resist not Evil”.
 Of course, it matters not in the slightest degree that Mr. Wybergh should incite the House against British Indians. They are not likely to be turned away from their duty by any threats. They have anticipated the worst. Theirs is courage born of purity of motive and resolution not to tarnish their honour. We deal with Mr. Wybergh’s remarks only because we believe him to be a sincere, though misguided, man, and to
 illustrate how an atmosphere of prejudice can taint even a wellbalanced mind. Of all the members of the Assembly, Mr. Hosken was the only one who strongly disapproved of the vindictive spirit that underlay Mr. Wybergh’s speech. Mr. Hosken had no hesitation in saying that the Bill was possible only in Russian or German territories, not on British soil. Little does Mr Wybergh know how arbitrary powers undertaken to repress a certain class of people recoil on those who are not even dreamt of. But we hope that in his calmer moments he has repented of his indiscretion.

52,,IDENTURED IMMIGRATION,"
        
 We are enabled this week to publish an important communi- cation addressed by the Secretary of the Indian Immigration Trust Board to the employers of indentured Indians, giving information as to the cost of the introduction of such labour into Natal. The document is well worth the perusal of Messrs Evans and Robinsonlibtech_106_footnotelibtech_107_footnote, who, after mature consideration, have come to the conclusion that indentured immigration into Natal should cease. Knowing, as we do, Mr. Haggar, we cannot mention him in the same category. Although we happen to agree with him in the attempt to end indentured Indian immigration, our motives are not the same, and the Indian community can have very little to do with a member who does not hesitate to libel it, and, when challenged to prove his statements, has not the manliness either to do so or to apologize. Mr. Rycroft’s letter is, from the European standpoint, almost a complete justification for stopping the labour. It is evident that the employers are scarcely able to cope with the expenses of introduction. Compulsory repatriation would for them be much worse, even if the Indian Government, surrendering its guardianship, were to agree to any such condition. It appears that, in 1905, whereas the employers contributed only £20 towards the cost of introduction, the actual cost was £31.10.9 per male adult, and, as more and more Indians avail themselves of the free passage back to India, owing to the burden of the £3 tax, the cost will be on the increase. It would thus appear that the sooner, from a  purely  economic standpoint, indentured labour is stopped, the better it will be for all parties.

53,,GENERAL SMUTS OBDURATE,"
        
 Indians in Pretoria gave another opportunity to the Government to withdraw from the false position in which it has placed itself by reason of the Asiatic Registration Act. The correspondence is lengthy and, unfortunately, we are unable to find space for it in this issue. The attorneys for the Indians in question made very  reasonable suggestions as to the most obnoxious clauses of the Registration Act. The Colonial Secretary has returned a categorical refusal to almost every one of the requests. We frankly confess that the Government could not have done otherwise. In our opinion, it had a right to interpret the letter to mean that Indians were not strong enough to carry out the jail resolution. The eminently reasonable letter, therefore, has been evidently misread by the Government. It  has passed regulations in keeping with the Act itself and its reply to the Indian petitioners of Pretoria simply follows out that policy. The correspondence will have done some good in that it will have streng- thened the Indian community in its resolve to undergo the sufferings consequent upon non-submission to compulsory registration.

 "
54,,S. A. B. I. COMMITTEE’S WORK,"
        
 The South Africa British Indian Committee is still working very hard. The questions put in Parliament a few days ago by Sir William Bull and Dr. Rutherford show that no adverse effect has followed the Indian community’s rejection of the Committee’s advice not to oppose the Transvaal law. The Committee carries on its work and that is as it should be. The Indian community is not bound to accept every piece of advice the Committee offers. The members of the Committee are large-hearted men, and they are going on with their work.
 Sir Muncherji Bhownaggree is such a cautious and far-sighted gentleman that, with him as President, the Committee is not likely to give up the Indian cause. Moreover, Mr. Ritch, as his letter to Lord Ampthill shows, does not hesitate to put correctly the Indian standpoint before the Committee.
 DELAGOA BAY
From Sir William Bull’s questions, the Delagoa Bay Indians will
 see that their case is also not forgotten. Acting upon Mr. Kothari’s letter in Indian Opinion, Sir William Bull immediately complained about the hardships suffered by the Indians there. We should mention in this connection that the Committee has received no contributions from the Delagoa Bay Indians. We think they ought to contribute to the Committee’s expenditure though they do  not  suffer  much hardship at present.
 RHODESIA
 Like Delagoa Bay, Rhodesia too has not been forgotten. Our readers may recall that it was about the same time that we had published the Rhodesian Council’s views on the question of Indians. Mr. Ritch made use of the information as soon as it reached England, and it is not likely now that very rigorous laws will be passed in Rhodesia. On reflection, everyone will have to admit that the honour of the Indians in both places, whether in Rhodesia or Delagoa Bay, depends really upon the struggle of the Transvaal Indians. It is they alone who will, if at all, save the honour of Indians. Failing that, neither the Committee nor any one else will be in a position to help.

55,,LOBITO BAY,"
        
 Our correspondent had reported that the condition of Indians in Lobito Bay was very bad. Hence we made inquiries through the agent of Messrs Griffith. He has replied as follows:
 The report utterly without foundation. Medical attendance ample.  Field Hospital fully equipped. Doctor specially appointed to attend coolies. If you think it advisable communicate with Natal Government ask them to send Inspector satisfy themselves. Reports utterly without foundation. Coolies are satisfied. Water supply good, plenty food.
 This report is at variance with the report of our correspondent. Our correspondent is a very exact and disinterested person. Hence his report is not to be set aside. Putting the two reports together we conclude that, when the labourers reached there, they were put to much hardship. This news reached our correspondent. Now their condition is not as bad as it had been. The labourers must be reasonably happy. Even then, it is obvious that it is not worth while just now for any Indian to take the risk of going there. There is no
 doubt that there is much hardship before one reaches Benguella. Even after reaching there, a free man will not be able to take up any profession there in the present condition.

56,,NATAL BILL REGARDING LICENCES AND STAMPS,"
        
 The Natal Government Gazette of July 12 publishes a Bill introducing certain changes in the matter of revenue licences. Below we give its main provisions:
      The 					Trading Act 					of 1897 					will henceforth 					apply to 					Kaffir eating-houses.  A 					hawking licence 					issued for one 					magisterial district 					shall not 					be valid in 					another district  No 					hawker shall remain 					at a 					single farm 					for more than 12 					hours or 					return to 					it during the 					following four days.  An 					extra stamp of 					the value of 					10 per cent of 					the municipal licence fee 					shall be 					affixed to 					the licence. 					The said 					10 per 					cent will be paid by the licensee and go to the Government.  The 					agents of 					a foreign 					firm will be 					required to 					take out 					a licence. 					An auctioneer 					selling foreign goods  by 					auction will also have to take out a licence.  At 					the time of taking 					out a 					trading licence, 					anyone possessing 					an agency 					is bound 					to disclose 					the fact 					to the 					Licensing Officer.  Rent 					receipts will 					be issued 					to Natives 					or to Indians 					from a 					special book numbered and with 					counterfoils bearing 					embossed stamps. It 					will not do to affix stamps.     
 This Bill has not yet become law, but it may be  taken for granted that it will be passed. Some changes may be made in it, but they will be of a minor character. The Bill is applicable to all. It is therefore difficult to oppose it. The idea behind the Bill is to raise money from every possible source at a time when the Colony is facing financial stringency. An angry potter twists the ear of his  donkey.libtech_108_footnoteLikewise the Government, being in need of money, has started harassing poor people like the hawkers. In short, the whole of South Africa is now impoverished. Every Government is therefore hunting for money in all directions. We do not reproduce here the different
 
 rates. If the Bill is passed, we shall also give, if necessary, the rates for licences. Of all the above clauses, the one regarding rent receipts is terrible. It ought to be resisted.

57,,INDENTURED INDIAN LABOURERS,"
        
 The Secretary of the Indian Immigration Trust Board, Mr. Rycroft, has addressed a letter to the employers of indentured Indian labourers, which we publish in full in our English section. It will be seen from that letter that the employers find the cost of importing indentured Indian labourers too heavy to bear, and if the Indian labourers are to be repatriated on the expiry of the period of contract, the expenditure will be very much heavier still. From this Mr. Rycroft concludes that legislation for the compulsory repatriation of labourers will mean heavy losses for employers.
 Because of this the employers of indentured labourers are on the horns of a dilemma. If they let the labourers return, their backs will be broken. If they keep them, and afterwards there is legislation for their repatriation to India, they will be involved in much too heavy an expenditure. It is a problem as to what should be done in this difficult situation. The Indian labourers are not likely to gain anything from thiscontroversy. Neither those who hold that there should be no further importation of indentured labourers, nor those who hold that it should continue, have any concern for the interests of Indians. If Indian labourers accept still lower wages, no one will protest, even if the labourers are to be repatriated on the expiry of the period of contract. Both sides will be happy. There is only one thing which can be of benefit to the Indian community, that is, the recruitment of indentured labourers should cease altogether. If any labourers come, they can gain nothing in conditions of slavery and circumstances will not permit them to live as free men. We are happy to observe that the whole Indian community takes offence at the hardships inflicted on the indentured labourers. This is a sign of our awakening. If we take a step forward and can have their importation ended, the enslavement of Indians will cease and those Indians who are already in South Africa will have some relief.

58,"July 	20, 1907",SPEECH AT NATAL INDIAN CONGRESSlibtech_109_footnote,"
              DURBAN, 
  July 	20, 1907  	Of all the struggles during the last 13 years, the present is the 	most critical. Therefore its consequences are bound to be equally 	momentous The effect of the law will be felt uniformly throughout 	South Africa. Not only are Rhodesia and German [East] Africa  	affected by it, but even in India it cannot but have a bad effect. 	Natal Indians have special reason to be concerned. (At this point a 	few examples similar to those in Indian Opinion of May 	18 and July 6 were given.) Indian servants are all right, but we do 	not want free Indians—that is what the whites say. Again, genuine 	cases are lumped together with bogus ones. I can recall the case of 	a poor man, Mr. Hasam from Porbunder. Being deprived of his 	ancestral land worth about Rs. 100, he came to me in Bombay. I 	advised him not to risk Rs. 500 in an attempt to get back land worth 	only Rs.100. “It is my ancestral land,” he replied. “I shall 	recover it at any cost. I shall never allow the title-deed to be 	nullified.” But, in the Transvaal, the  title-deed refers to our 	person. The Government wants to snatch away the one that we have and 	to give another instead, just as it likes. Moreover, while issuing 	the document it asks the Indian for the names of his mother, father, 	 wife  and  others  as  we  saw  in  the  playlibtech_110_footnotelibtech_111_footnoteand 	demands impressions, first, of ten fingers and then of eight 	fingers. After getting these, it says that it will issue the 	documents if and as it likes. Who will submit to such slavery? A man 	who earns £3 or £4 can make his living anywhere with the slightest 	effort. Why would he, for this pittance, invite disgrace by 	remaining in the Transvaal? Again, a man earning £400 loves his 	honour more than money. The rich and the poor may perhaps, by 	shutting their ears, suffer themselves to be insulted, but they will 	not tolerate the harassment of their eight and ten year old 	children. The Boers are a brave people and we may not be able to 	oppose them. But we can resist if they ask us to submit to unjust 	orders and become slaves. We are looked upon as bad cowries. The 	present is an occasion to prove ourselves to be good cowries. If we 	pass the test, Indians in all parts of the world will reap the 	benefit. Today India gets the kind of justice that the cats got from 	the monkey in the well-known fable. The Government succeeds by 	setting the two     
 cats—Hindus and Muslims—against each other. Here it is not so. Both the communities here are united, hence our courage will bear fruit. After considering all these points, I advised gaol-going at the mass meeting in September.libtech_112_footnotelibtech_113_footnoteAll those present raised their hands and took a solemn oath, with God as witness, to go to gaol. What has happened since then is known to all. If we do not keep our pledge now, we shall be false to God. Moreover, new laws will be passed one after another. We shall be called cowards. We shall then be left only to live a dog’s life. Once a white woman asked me, “What does the hawker, who is used to being kicked, know about honour or dishonour?” “Once he sees that it is humiliating,” I replied, “he will not get himself registered, even if he has to face death.” To assure herself of this, she used to ask the hawkers going to her door if they would take out new registers. She always got a negative reply. Now she has come to realize that Indians have become courageous. And so she says that, when they go to gaol, she would keep inquiring about their health and bring them whatever relief she could. Mr. Hosken says that if all Indians go to gaol, the Government dare not raise a finger against them. We should realize from this that, if we stand by our pledge, bright days are in store for us. Since we have the reputation today of being noisy but ineffective grumblers, our petition against the Immigration Act has been consigned to the waste-paper basket. The reason why I place all these things before you is that you may take a lesson from this example and be prepared You [in Natal] and we [in the Transvaal] are one and it will be nothing remarkable if you join usin our sufferings. It is not enough that you help us by talking, that is, bypassing resolutions and writing letters. It will be the most valuable help if you give what I have come to beg of you. When all Indians in the  Transvaal are prepared to suffer any loss in the struggle, you should not lag behind in giving monetary help. In giving such help, you will not be doing anything really big; you will only be doing your duty. You will have to maintain those that are left behind, if a large number of people go to gaol. You should therefore make the necessary arrangement to meet the difficult situation. I am sure that you will help.

  Your 	petitioner is 	the Acting 	Chairman of the 	British Indian 	Association of the Transvaal.  The 	Association abovenamed 	respectfully approaches 	this Hon’ble House with 	regard to 	the Bill to place 	restrictions on 	immigration into 	this Colony to 	provide for 	the removal therefrom of 	prohibited immigrants 	and other persons 	and to 	 establish  and maintain 	an “Immigration 	Department” now or 	shortly to 	be before this 	Hon’ble House for consideration.

 JOHANNESBURG,
 2 p. m., Friday,
 [July 26, 1907]
 The latest available news shows that not a single application for registration has been made so far at the Permit Office; it is rumoured, however, that the Permit authorities have started receiving applications at night in a private building.
 A meeting of Indians was called on Thursday afternoon. It was stated there that, though every effort would be  made lawfully  to induce people not to submit to the Act, everyone was free to do as he liked. It is a disgraceful thing for people to give applications at night in a private building, and for the authorities to behave in such a manner. Those present at the meeting were firm on the question of
 
 going to gaol, and are working most enthusiastically.
 The Government has removed from prominent places in the town the posterslibtech_117_footnoteadvocating boycott. Much amusement was caused by the poster on the door of the Permit Office. On the Government inquiring into the authorship of the notice, Mr. Gandhi took upon himself full responsibility for it.
 There will be a mass meeting on the 31st. All business is to stop. Notices are being issued. A strong committee has been set up for the purpose. The stores are not to be closed for four days, as announced earlier. As the time-limit for registration is nearing its end, tension is mounting every moment. It is likely that interesting developments may take place before the end of the month.
 Piles of telegrams have been received from our sympathetic friends at Durban, offering encouragement and assistance.

63,,“STAGGERING HUMANITY”,"
    
 The   late   President    Krugerlibtech_118_footnotelibtech_119_footnoteis    said    to    have    “staggered humanity” by engaging in an unequal struggle with a mighty empire. It is in his late country—though now nominally British—that history is to repeat itself through Indians in the Transvaal. But the parallel is not exact. The late President fought in a bloody war. Indians in the Transvaal will stagger humanity without shedding a drop of blood. Indians are about to do more, if we may say so without disrespect, than the late President did. For the sake of their honour a mere sentiment, as some say—they are preparing to sacrifice  their  all. Theirs, indeed, will be the widow’s mite.
 Many friends tell them that the local Government are determined to enforce the Asiatic Act at all cost and that they are likely to have their worst fears realised. The Indians retort that they are prepared for the eventuality. Send them to prison? They are ready. Deport them forcibly? They are ready also. Anything, even death, would be better than that they should labour under the ban of criminality and that they should be traitors to their God.
 It may be that they are misguided and that theirs is not intrinsically a right cause. If so, they again appeal to the parallel cited
 
 by us and reply that, although many consider that the late President Kruger was ill-advised in hurling defiance at the British Government, everybody admires him for the courage of his convictions. It is enough that he fought for a cause he considered to be just. But the President fought under the inspirationof the old Testament and after the pattern of the heroes of that venerable book.  Indians who  migrated to this country in search of an honest livelihood, and who find themselves face to face with civic and social extinction, are  fighting under the inspiration of the New Testament. Gentle Jesus, the greatest passive resister the world has seen, is their pattern.  What matters it to them if the rulers of the Transvaal reject their advances, if their overlord King Edward declare himself, like Mahomed of Ghaznilibtech_120_footnotelibtech_121_footnote, to be unable to protect them. Was not Jesus rejected and yet did He not resist the blasphemy that His persecutors would have Him utter on pain of suffering what was, in their estimation, an inglorious death, side by side with thieves and robbers? But the crown of thorns today sits better on that bleeding head than a crown bedecked with diamonds of the purest water on any sovereign. He died indeed, yet He lives in the memory of all true sons of God, and with Him live also the thieves who accepted the humble Nazarene and His teaching.
 So, too, will Indians of the Transvaal, if they remain true to their God, live in the memory of their children and their countrymen who will be able to say, after they have left this transient world, ‘Our forefathers did not betray us for a mess of pottage.’

64,,MR. PARSEE RUSTOMJEE’S GENEROSITY,"
    
 Mr.  Rustomjeelibtech_122_footnote,  whose  name  has  become  a  household  word among Indians in South Africa, has written to us a characteristic letter in Gujarati of which we give the following rendering:
 Although I have often publicly expressed my sentiments regarding the position of our countrymen in the Transvaal, you will, perhaps, allow me to voice them through your columns. Every Indian in South Africa will partake of the result of the struggle in which Indians in the Transvaal are engaged. We who are outside that country cannot possibly take any share in their
 
 physical sufferings. They will not only undergo the hardships of prison life but many of them will also have to lose all they have. If we cannot go to gaol, we can at least follow their noble example in sacrificing our possessions for the common good. I, therefore, with all humility and in the name of God, hereby inform my fellow-countrymen in the Transvaal, as an earnest of my intense desire to share their sorrows, that henceforth everything I possess in this world is held by me in trust for my countrymen in the Transvaal until the struggle is over. I have no doubt that many of my friends in South Africa are prepared as a matter of duty to render similar pecuniary help to the Transvaal Indians. Pretoria has, indeed, filled our hearts with hope. Let us trust that our countrymen there, as also in other parts of the Transvaal, will carry out their resolution to the end.
 This letter speaks for itself. We only add by way of comment that those who know Mr. Rustomjee know what very substantial help this promise means. It is a letter which should fill every Indian with fresh courage and hope.

65,,DEATH OF MR. ADAMJEE MIANKHANlibtech_123_footnote,"
    
 Mr. Adamjee Miankhan of the firm of G. H. Miankhan & Co., Durban, and Vice-President of the Natal Indian Congress, died at Ahmedabad, India, on the 20th instant, at the comparatively early age of 41. Mr. Adamjee went on a visit to India in February last, and his brother in Durban has been receiving regular letters, but no serious illness was complained of. Mr. Adamjee has rendered very great service to the Indian community in Natal, and his able and willing help in all matters relating to their welfare will be much missed. Born of a well-known family of lace merchants in the capital of Gujarat, Mr. Adamjee Miankhan, with his father and his brother, Mr. Goolam Hoosen, migrated, when he was yet 18, to South Africa, in the year 1884. His knowledge of the English language was of the greatest service to him in making his mark as well among Indians as among his many European friends. It was not, however, before 1896 that he became intimately connected with Indian public affairs. On the temporary withdrawal of the then Secretary of the Congress, Mr. Adamjee, on account of his work and sterling qualities, was unanimously elected by the Congress to act as Honorary Secretary.
 
 During his tenure of office, he was ably supported by Mr. Abdul Karim Hajee Adam Jhaveri. Mr. Adamjee turned the credit balance of the Congress from £100 into that of £1,100, and during the latter part of 1896 and the beginning of 1897, when the now famous anti-Indian demonstration took place in Durban, Mr. Adamjee, by his patience, calmness and perseverance, was instrumental in  confronting  the serious difficulties of the community.

66,,SAD DEATH OF ADAMJEE MIANKHAN,"
    
 Inscrutable are the ways of God. It is only five months since our well-known leader, Mr. Adamjee Miankhan, returned home to India. And  now  comes  the  news  of   his   sudden   death   on   the   23rdlibtech_124_footnoteat Ahmedabad after an illness of 20 days which caused him bed-sores. Those who have heard of him and of his work in Natal and other parts of South Africa, cannot but feel grieved at this sad news. Gradually the time is coming in South Africa when patriotic workers will be needed in still larger numbers. At such a time it is difficult to fill the gap created by the premature death of an able and conscientious leader like Mr. Adamjee Miankhan. His patriotism and other valuable qualities of character are well known. Traits of character such as intelligence, patience, quickness of grasp, and readinesss for self- sacrifice, which he showed as Acting Secretary of the Congress and during his subsequent public career, deserve emulation. His popularity was evident on the occasion of the farewell party at the time of his departure. Even in India it was his intention to conduct a campaign against the hardships [of Indians] in South Africa. It is but natural that the death of such a benevolent gentleman at the early age of  41 should cause grief. We offer our condolences to the family of the departed, and urge his admirers to emulate his great virtues.

 "
67,,DIVINE LAW,"
    
 The time to test the strength of the obnoxious law is approaching. All Indians will be anxiously watching what the Government does on August 1. To speek the truth, however, we should wait with courage, not with anxiety. Any pain we suffer in order to
 
 save ourselves from the obnoxious law must be counted as pleasure. Every Indian should pray, “let me be the first to go to gaol, so that my brothers are spared the pain.”
 We have already examined the various reasons why we ought not to submit to the obnoxious law. It should be noted that in defying this murderous law we obey the divine law. To submit to the unjust law will be a sin. Likewise, it will be a sin to violate the divine law. Hewho abides by the divine law will win bliss in this world, as also in the next. What is this divine law? It is that one has to suffer  pain before enjoying pleasure and that one’s true self-interest consists in the good of all, which means that we should die—suffer—for others. Let us take a few examples.
 When a lump of earth is broken into dust, it mixes with water and nourishes plant life. It is by sacrificing themselves that plants sustain every kind of animal life. Animals sacrifice themselves for the good of their progeny. The mother suffers unbearable pain at the time of child-birth, but feels only happy in that suffering. Both the mother and the father undergo hardships in bringing up  their children. Wherever communities and nations exist,  individual  members of those communities or nations have endured hardships for the common good. In the sixth century B. C., Lord Buddha, after wandering from forest to forest, braving the extremes of heat and cold and suffering many privations, attained self-realization and  spread ideas of spiritual welfare among the people. Nineteen hundred years ago, Jesus Christ, according to the Christian belief, dedicated his life to the people and suffered many insults and hardships. The prophet Mahomed suffered much. People had prepared themselves for an attack on his life. He paid no heed to it. These great and holy men obeyed the law stated above and brought happiness to mankind. They did not think of their personal interest but found their own happiness in the happiness of others.
 The same thing happens in political matters too. Hampden, Tyler, Cromwell and other Englishmen were prepared to sacrifice their all for the people and did not feel concerned at being robbed of all their possessions. Nor did they feel anxious when their lives were in danger. That is why the British people today rule over a large empire. The rulers of the Transvaal enjoy power because they suffered great hardships before our very eyes. Mazzini suffered banishment for the sake of his country. Today he is being revered. He is regarded as the father of Italian unity. By suffering endless hardships, George Washington made America what it is today. This again shows that one must pass through suffering before tasting happiness.  For  public good, men have to suffer hardships even to the point of death.
 Let us go further. It is a sin to violate one’s pledge—to betray manhood with which we are endowed. To save himself from the sin of incest, Yusoof Abesalam  suffered  gaol.  Imam  Hasanlibtech_125_footnoteand  Husseinlibtech_126_footnoterefused to acknowledge the authority of Yazidlibtech_127_footnote, for it would have been wrong to do so. For this reason, that is, in order to preserve their honour, they becamemartyrs. For the sake of honour, God’s devotee, Prahlad, boldly embraced the red-hot pillar, and the child Sudhanva threw himself into the frying pan without any hesitation. For the sake of truth, Harishchandra allowed himself to be sold to a low-caste man; he gave up his throne and suffered separation from his wife and son. For the sake of his father’s word, Ramachandra went into the forest. And for the sake of their right, the Pandavas left their kingdom and wandered in the forest for 14 years.
 Today it has fallen to the lot of the Indian community in the Transvaal to submit to this great divine law. So persuaded, we congratulate our countrymen. They have the opportunity now to see the Indian community throughout South Africa gaining its freedom through them. How could such great happiness come to us without our going through equally great suffering? Our petition is no longer addressed to man, but to God Himself. Day and night He listens to our plaints. We do not have to seek an appointment with Him for the hearing of our petition. He hears the petitions of all at the same time. With the purest heart therefore we pray to God that our brothers in the Transvaal may be prepared to suffer fearlessly anything that  may befall them in August, placing their trust in Him alone, and with only His name on their lips.

 "
68,,ALLY’S MISTAKE,"
    
 Mr. Ritch’s letter this week and the letter, received along with it, addressed by Mr. Ally to Justice Ameer Ali, both deserve careful consideration. We had some doubt whether these letters should be published. On reflection, however, we decided in the end that, in the interest of the country, we certainly ought to publish them. At such a critical time, we cannot afford to think of the effect they may have on the minds of certain individuals. We have only to think, of what would
 
 lead to the common good.
 Mr. Ally, in our opinion, acted hastily in writing  to  Justice Ameer Ali. It was a mistake to have written such a letter. It becomes clear now why a letter was received from the Committee advising us against taking the struggle to the point of going to gaol. Mr. Ally’s letter led the Committee to think that there were differences among us. If such differences do exist, a person having incomplete information will only advise us that we should give up the idea of carrying on the struggle by going to gaol. In fact, no differences existed and there was therefore no need for Mr. Ally to write the letter he did to Justice Ameer Ali. Moreover, no one was reluctant to meet General Botha. On the Contrary, the British Indian Association made all-out efforts to meet him. In spite of these efforts, General Botha refused to grant an interview. When the interview was refused, a written petition was submitted to him stating that the demands of the Indian community should be accepted.
 To say that every Indian merchant is a Muslim and  every  hawker a Hindu is, we believe, a poisonous comment. We take it as a disgrace to the Indian community that Mr. Ally should have penned such words. The Transvaal struggle affects Hindus and Muslims alike. The rights of both would vanish; moreover, it is obvious on reflection that the struggle would lack even dignity if the merchants did not join. The more respectable the man, the greater would be the harm—such is the effect of the deadly law. To a man with a greater sense of self-respect, the law ought to be all the more abhorrent. The question of such distinctions as Hindus and Muslims therefore does not arise at all. Moreover, the relations between Indians in  South  Africa professing the two religions are not in the least strained. By and large, all live in peace and amity. That in these circumstances such a letter should have been addressed to the Committee portends, in our view, a very unfavourable issue for the Indian community. Hence, we publish this letter along with our comments on it, to warn all Indians that, when the time of our deliverance is at hand, no one should imagine that differences exist between Hindus and Muslims or dream of creating any.
 We do not wish to hurt Mr. Ally in any way by discussing the matter in public. Those who disagree with him need not be angry with him; rather, they should pity him for his mistake. The main point to be learnt from this is that every person engaged in public work should take a vow that he would not, under any circumstances, act in a way that might harm public interests. We would advise Mr. Ally to correct his mistake.
 We can also see from the above correspondence that, if Mr. Ally had not written the letter, the Committee perhaps would not have sent us a cable to dissuade us[from going to gaol]. However, it should be clearly borne in mind that the Committee’s advice is of no use to us at the present moment. Those rushing into the field of battle cannot listen to the advice of men who keep themselves at home. We have now to go on fighting, relying only on our own strength. If we feel that submitting to the obnoxious law is sinful, we shall not commit the sin just because the Committee or someone else advises us to do so. We have to give an account to God, not to the Committee.

 "
69,,INDIANS IN CAPE,"
    
 Fresh elections to the Cape Parliament are likely to take place soon. It is being asked how the black and brown peoples of the Cape will use their votes. The discussion is going on not only in the Cape, but also in other parts of South Africa. What we have to say is particularly for the Indian voters.
 We think the Indian voters in the Cape have missed many opportunities of improving the conditions of the Indian community there and elsewhere. There is no point in having the franchise if at the appropriate time it is not properly utilized. If the natives and the Indians of the Cape realize the value of the vote, they can still bring about many changes.
 The first thing to remember is that it is not absolutely necessary that the votes of the Kaffirs and the Asiatics should always be cast on the same side. The rights they have to secure are different. Their struggles are of different types. For example, the Cape Immigration Act is a hardship to the Indian community; it has little effect on the Kaffirs. Again, the Licences Act affects only the Indians. Moreover, as South Africa is their mother-country, they have a better right here than we have. But the Indians can demand their rights with greater force on the strength of the Proclamation of 1858 and in view of their being an ancient nation. Each has thus some advantages over  the other. The Indian community therefore should think independently as to which way it should cast its vote.
 Another thing to remember is that a voter is under no obligation to vote for the one or the other side. Sometimes, a very powerful effect can be produced by abstaining from exercising the franchise. We know that once the few Indians of Durban who had votes resolved
 to refrain from voting. The effect was that a high officer sent for them and made certain promises which were later carried out.
 Bearing these two things in mind, let us consider the conditions in the Cape.  There  are  two  parties  in  the  Cape:  Bondlibtech_128_footnotelibtech_129_footnoteor  Dutch; Progressive or British and “Foreign”. We must admit that just now these two parties are in the condition of the pot calling the kettle black. They are both tarred with the same brush. Neither of them overflows with love for the blacks. The Progressive party has violated the word of the late Mr. Rhodes libtech_130_footnote. We would advise the Indian community in the Cape to ask the leaders of both the parties in writing whether certain amendments can be madeto the Immigration Act and the Licences Act. Votes should be cast in favour of the party which boldly and honestly gives favourable replies. If, however, both hesitate to give a straight reply, say one thing privately and another publicly, no encouragement should be given to such deceitful  men.  They should be plainly told that in such circumstances the Indian community would vote for neither.
 We are sure the prestige of the Indian community will rise by so doing. And if not this time, next time one of the two parties will make certain definite promises. We appeal to the Cape Indians to act this time only in the interests of the community. No consideration should be shown to any whites either because they are friends or because they promise some benefits to a few Indians. Some other time we shall consider what and how much to ask for.

 "
70,,ATTACK ON RELIGION,"
    
We are taught at school that, under British rule:
 Gone are the passions of hatred and the furies of revenge, And gone are the blood-thirsty oppressors;
 Smooth is the flow of life, with peace Among all the castes and creeds.
 Look, none dares to catch the poor goat by the ear, As she moves leisurely by.
 Know this to be the kindness of God, And be thou glad at heart, O India.
 
 But now we may change the verse and sing:
 Stronger are the passions of hatred and the furies of revenge, And more numerous the blood-thirsty oppressors;
 Full of strife is this life, and full of discords all the castes and creeds.
Look, every passerby seizes the poor goat by the ear.
 Think of this, and act thou with courage to seek relief, O India. This  thought  occurred  to   us   on   reading the   letter   of  the
General  Manager  of  the   Natal   Railway.   He   has   stated   that while
 railway tickets at concession rates are available to English or European priests, such concessions will not henceforth be available to Indian Christian priests. This means that Hindu, Muslim and Christian priests, if they are Indians, will not get tickets at concession rates.
 This is going one step further than they have done in the Transvaal. Now Indian Christians, too, are being distinguished from European Christians. We take this to be a good sign. For, through such hardships and humiliation, we Indians shall gradually come closer together and cling to one another for survival.
 From one point of view, Mr. Ross’s letter is mere trifle. What does it matter whether or not a few Indian Christian priests get tickets at concession rates? From another point of view it is a serious matter. As an instance of the planned effort to humiliate Indians in South Africa in every way, his letter ought to be seriously challenged. The Europeans here think it no serious matter to insult the Indian community or the religions of India.
 We are glad to see that the President of the Mahomedan Association, Mr. Peeran Mahomed, has written to Mr. Ross on this issue, and has taken necessary steps. There is a possibility of getting a satisfactory reply from Mr. Ross. If there is such a reply, that will be nothing for us to gloat over.
 The key to the freedom of South African Indians is in the hands of the Transvaal Indians. If they keep their word and fight, Mr. Ross and others will stop insulting them.

71,,WARNING TO EAST LONDON,"
    
 The British Press has published a cable regarding the work of the deputation sent to the Cape by East London Indians. It states that the Indian community concedes that laws should be framed to control
 “coolie Indians”, but calls for regulations which grant special concessions to respectable Indians. It adds, moreover, that exemption certificates should be granted to some Indians on the lines of those granted to the Kaffirs.
 We do not believe that East London Indians have made any such demand. Our enemies are only waiting for us to make such a mistake. For if we demand a law introducing such distinctions, we shall be striking at our feet with our own axe. There is and will always be the distinction between good men and bad men. But no law can lay down the dividing line between the good and the bad, or the high and the low, or the noble and the mean. One who is a hawker today may become a merchant tomorrow. A merchant may be  rendered poor and be obliged to seek service. Such things have always been happening. Now, who is  to  be termed a  “coolie”? How can there be  any  such  distinction?  Who  can   make   such   a   distinction? Who will go to a white officer to receive at his hands a badge of “high” or “low”? We are sure the law cannot make any such distinction enabling a few Indians to get the exemption certificates. To ask for such a law is only to invite slavery.

72,,RUSSIA’S EXAMPLE,"
    
 Our readers are aware that the Czar of Russia has set up a Dumalibtech_131_footnotelibtech_132_footnote, that is, a Parliament. Recently, the English Press published the news that most members of the Duma have been to gaol or suffered banishment in the country’s cause. Therefore, the Parliament is also given the nick name of “an assembly of convicts”. These members who have been to gaol and have been chosen by the people in the elections to the Duma are not mere illiterates or peasants, but are highly educated people. Some of them are eminent lawyers or doctors. There is one member, Mr. Gobernov who had even been sentenced to death. Another member, Mr. Cymbersuck, had been banished to Siberia for several years. The Russian rulers are often unhappy over the election of such men. But neither the members nor the voters care for their displeasure. There is a member, named Dimitriy Perlashin, who comes from a noble family. He had suffered imprisonment for two years. We can cite many such names. But what
 
 has been said is enough to give the reader some idea. Further,  it should be remembered that a Russian prison is a veritable dungeon. No amenities are provided. Again, Russia is an extremely cold country. The gaolers are cruel. All these hardships are endured by these brave heroes for the good of the people. They are not deterred by the severities of weather. They do not bother  whether  their  Emperor is pleased or displeased, but fearlessly go on doing what they consider to be in the country’s interests. They do  not  lose  heart though the people of Russia are still not free, but continue to do their duty. They do so because they think that, if not they, at least those who come after them will ultimately reap the benefit of their sufferings and their country will be free.
 We wish that, with the example of such staunch patriots before them, and with faces turned to God and His name inscribed forever in their hearts, the Transvaal Indians will swim across the current of the obnoxious law.

 "
73,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 OBNOXIOUS LAW
 Only four days of July will be left when this issue is published. For the next issue I hope to send a telegram to Phoenix to say that the Government has begun arresting Indians for not taking out the new registers. But it will not be wrong to believe that, while I look forward to it, some others may be afraid of it.
 APPEAL TO PRETORIA
 Meanwhile, I appeal to our countrymen in Pretoria to maintain to the end their own honour and that of the Indian community, as they have done so far. I am sure there is not one Indian in Pretoria who will defile himself by a visit, on the last day, to the hell of the Permit office. I think it will be fully realized that by going there nothing will be gained except disgrace, and so I hope the thought of such a visit will not occur to anyone even in a dream.
 WHAT NEXT?
 I have on various occasions given a reply to this question. However, I think it right to give it again. The courage that we have displayed in July is of one kind. That required in August is of a different kind. In July, we had to show the courage of remaining at
 home. NOW, in August we shall be dragged to a magistrate in a court, where we shall have to give a bold answer. The mere mention of a law court strikes fear in our hearts. What will happen then, when we are produced before a magistrate? It will be more difficult to maintain courage this time, but it is needed in full measure.
 POLICE WILL ARREST
 In the first place, on August I it will be open to the police to arrest any or all of the Indians for not applying for a fresh register. Our firmness in keeping the pledge will then be tested.
 DO NOT OFFER BAIL
 Every Indian should remember that at that time no arrested person is to offer bail and that none should stand bail for him. Then will begin our training for a stay in the prison-palace. The arrested Indian will be produced before a magistrate the same day or the next.
 QUESTION OF DEFENCE
 Probably he will be charged with failure to apply for fresh registration. At this stage, provided the arrested person holds a valid permit or is a minor for whom no permit is necessary, Mr. Gandhi will appear for his defence gratis and Messrs Essop Mia and Gandhi will depose that the Indian community has been bound, by oath and by a resolution, not to submit to the new law, that the accused has accepted the said resolution, and that, if for such action a sentence has to be passed, it should first be passed on the office-bearers of  the Association. Thereafter, if a deposition by the accused is considered necessary, he will state that not only has he acted in obedience to the community’s Resolution, but that he personally disapproves the Act, that he does not, therefore, intend to take out a new register and that, if sentenced, he will go to gaol, but pay no fine.
 CONSEQUENCE
 As a result of such a defence Messrs Essop Mia and Gandhi may be arrested first, and the accused may be let off. If, however, this does not happen, the Court is bound to pass a sentence on the accused. The Court has the power to impose a fine and may therefore sentence the accused to a fine, on the non-payment of which, he will be sent to gaol.
 NO FINE TO BE PAID
 It must be distinctly remembered then that one is to go to gaol, not to pay the fine. I recommend that, on and from August l, no Indian whatever should carry any money with him and certainly not
 gold in any case. Temptation is a very bad thing. Not being used to the idea of gaol, on hearing the sentence of fine, the accused may find his hands unconsciously straying into his pocket or he may cast an imploring glance at his friends. When this happens,  he  should mentally ask for God’s forgiveness, remove his hand [from the  pocket], stand erect and, clearing his throat, declare that he will not pay the fine but go to gaol. He should remember at the same time how in England women, both young and old, have refused to pay the fine of half a crown and preferred to go to gaol for the sake of their right.
 WHAT WILL OTHERS DO?
 We assume that ordinarily all the Indians will not be arrested simultaneously. What will be the duty then of those who remain outside? The answer is easy. They should congratulate the brother who has shown courage and sought gaol, and help his relatives; as for themselves, they should not get panicky and apply for registration. On the contrary, everyone should pray that his should be the next turn to go to gaol.
 WHAT IF MR. GANDHI IS ARRESTED FIRST?
 If this happens, there will be no defence to make. Everything will be made clear at the time of Mr. Gandhi’s trial. There will be a quick solution of the matter, if, after he is sent to gaol or deported, the Indian community courageously adheres to its resolution. The struggle carried on so far will be worth while only if the Indian community remains firm, no matter who is imprisoned or deported.
 WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF REGISTERS ARE TAKEN OUT?
 But, if out of fear Indians apply for registers or pay the fine, or seek release on bail, the struggle waged so far will come to nought. It will be proved that we had no real courage. It will be believed that it was all mere incitement by the leaders. It will be said that the splendid show made so far was only external glitter. The gilt will come off and we shall be shown up to be base copper rather than gold, and we shall indeed have proved ourselves worthless.
 GOVERNMENT’ S OTHER WEAPONS
 As I have pointed out above, the Government can take steps other than charging us with failure to take out a fresh register. For, all the present registers and permits stand cancelled. The people can therefore be charged with staying without a permit. As I said in earlier letters, if such a charge is made the person will be given a notice at the first trial to leave the country within a specific period. If he does not
 leave the country within that period, he can be sentenced to  a  minimum imprisonment of one month. Even if the trial proceeds on these lines, the defence will be the same. On receipt of a notice after such trial, one should not leave, but should get arrested and go to gaol at the expiry of the notice period.
 ANY FEAR FOR MERCHANTS?
 Persons with a large business need not have any fear. It  is unlikely that all the men in an establishment will be simultaneously arrested. The shops are certainly not going to be looted. The utmost loss that may be caused is that the shops will remain closed for a few days. Nothing more than this is likely to happen. But it will be wise for all merchants to take stock, etc. The only object of doing so is that, in case the creditors become impatient, one may be able to settle accounts immediately.
 DUTY OF ASSOCIATION
 At a time like this, it is the duty of public bodies in the Transvaal and elsewhere like the British Indian Association and the Natal Indian Congress to pass and publish resolutions of sympathy. They should send monetary aid for the maintenance of the dependants of those arrested, and should have the matter discussed in public as much as possible both at home and abroad.
 QUERY BY “THE SUNDAY TIMES”
 Commenting on the law, the editor of The Sunday Times asks what steps the Government contemplates for putting into prison those Indians who may not have taken out new registers in August. Will they build new prisons for them? The question is asked in a jesting tone, but it clearly shows that the Indian struggle has made them nervous.
 MIDDELBURG INDIANS
 The Town Council of Middelburg has again passed a resolution to oust Indians from the Location. The intention is to make a test case against an Indian and ascertain if the Town Council has the right to do so.
 WARNING
 Some Indians think that, if even a single Indian takes out the new register, it will be difficult for others to keep back. It can be said that those who think in this strain have not correctly understood the nature of the struggle. If one of them jumps into a well or does something wrong, will the whole Indian community follow him and do likewise? If not, how can it do so in the case of the sinister and
 wicked law which is more dreadful than any well? On the other hand, it will be too much to assume that not even one Indian will choose to become a slave. If the community had so much spirit, how could it be today in such a low state in South Africa or anywhere else? In this struggle it should be remembered that every Indian is to decide for himself independently of others. One need not look to others. The new register is not such a delicacy that, if one tastes it, others will forthwith pounce upon it. We should have it firmly impressed on our mind that we shall never win so long as we do not understand this. To those Indians who, out of cowardice, weakness or ignorance, cannot refrain from taking out new registers, I shall say that the only proper thing for them to do is to admit their weakness and advise others not to follow their example.
 PRETORIA MEETING
 A special meeting was held at Pretoria on Tuesday evening. Mr. Roos, advocate, was also present. He said that General Smuts was anxious to know what effect his letter had, and  that  he  (General Smuts) had a suspicion that the Indian leaders had not given publicity to his letter. It would be well, therefore, Mr. Roos said, if the opinion of the meeting was expressed. Mr. Gandhi handed to Mr. Roos a copy of Indian Opinion and told him that the substance of General Smuts’ letter had been already placed before every Indian. Mr. Roos promised to show it to Mr. Smuts. Besides Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Essop Mia and Mr. Omarji Sale of Johannesburg also attended the meeting.
 Mr. Gandhi translated Mr. Smuts’ letter and advised the meeting in no case to submit to the new law.
 Mr. Hajee Habib moved a resolution to the effect that if General Smuts did not accept the demands made in the letter of Mr. Roos, there could be no submission to the law.  Moreover,  the correspondence with General Smuts should be made public.  Mr. Hajee Habib’s resolution was seconded by Mr. Suj. Mr. Ayub Beg Mahomed and Mr. Omarji also supported it. Mr. Roos said that the law should be accepted and then whatever demands we wished to make should be made constitutionally. In spite of this, Mr. Hajee Habib’s resolution was unanimously carried.
 Though the meeting has acted with so much spirit, the situation is getting somewhat critical as the actual time draws near. Doubts are expressed whether the whole community will remain firm to the very end;
At the present juncture every Indian should remember one
 thing— that, whatever the number of people who take out new  permits, those who have the courage must certainly not do so.
 SMUTS INTENTIONS
 In his reply, Mr. Smuts has stated that a coastal Permit Office was necessary. The old Dutch laws could not be enforced since, so far, the British Government used to intervene. But now that the British Government is not likely to interfere, it was necessary to have the Coast Office so as to ensure that a coolie, once going out, never returns. What could be worse if, in spite of such replies, the Indian community should submit to the new law?

          PRETORIA, 
     TO  THE 	HON’BLE 	THE COLONIAL 	SECRETARY 	PRETORIA SIR, July 	27, 1907 
  	My Committee have learnt with regret that applications for 	registration of Asiatics are being received by officials late at 	night and in private stores or other places. My Committee have also 	learnt that this method has been adopted on the strength of 	representations made to the Government to the effect that British 	Indians desiring to make application under the Act are threatened 	with physical injury, etc.  	My Committee disclaim all knowledge of any such threats having been 	used by any responsible member of the community. The activityof the 	Committee has been confined to vigorous propaganda work in the way 	of showing the degradation  and  disadvantage involved in accepting 	the provisions of the Act.  	The volunteers, it will be admitted, have simply performed 	missionary work. My committee have publicly and emphatically 	informed British Indians that any member wishing to make his 	application will not only be left unharmed but that he will, if  so 	desired by him, be escorted to the Registration Office. In 	the humble opinion of my Committee, those Indians who    
 have applied secretly and at night time have done so in order to conceal from British Indians what they, too, in common with other members of the community, have believed to be an act derogatory to their honour.
 In the humble opinion of my Committee, secret  registration after office hours and in private stores, even if it be not illegal, can hardly be considered a dignified proceeding. In any event, my Committee beg respectfully to assure the Government that the Indian community in what is to it a life-and-death struggle has no intention to resort to intimidation or methods which may in any way be considered even reprehensible.

         NEW 	LAW — 	GHASTLY BETRAYAL    [July 	29, 1907] 
  	None of my letters so far has been written, I think, with so much 	grief as this one. Whether I ought to publish this news at all is 	itself a difficult question to decide. However, I feel that I ought 	to take notice of the incident that took place among the Indian 	community at Pretoria, if we mean to be truthful and courageous.  	For the Indian community in South Africa the last week of July will 	prove memorable. Just when we were hoping with confidence that the 	hour of our victory was at hand, there was treachery in the 	community and our success became doubtful. The conspiracy came to 	light by accident at the Pretoria Railway Station after 10 p. m. on 	Wednesday, July 24. Messrs Cachalia, Vyas, Beg and other Indians 	were present there to receive Mr. Gandhi. They learnt that something 	suspicious was going on in Mr. Khamisa’s shop. There were a few 	white men inside, and some detectives near the shop. On receipt of 	this information, these gentlemen thought thatthey would knock at 	the door of Mr. Khamisa’s shop, and if the door should be opened 	and some move to submit to the new law should be found afoot, they 	would dissuade the persons concerned. Mr Gandhi knocked at the door, 	and so did Mr. Vyas. A man came out and inquired who they were. Mr. 	Gandhi answered him, and asked his permission to go 
 inside. No one opened the door. Meanwhile, a detective came and started asking questions. Mr. Beg gave a bold reply. Then Mr. Gandhi spoke to the detective. Thereupon the latter said, “You know the law, do what is proper”, and went away. A few minutes later he and two other officers came there. Meanwhile, Mr. Vyas had gone to call Mr. Hajee Habib. Taking each member of the above party by hand, the detective asked him to move away. They all left. Everyone thought that a conspiracy must have been in the hatching in Mr. Khamisa’s shop.
 Many Indians kept awake the whole night. On the morning of Thursday, the entire Indian community became agitated. Letters and telegrams were despatched to all the towns. It is said that at Mr. Khamisa’s shop that night, at the stroke of twelve, some 20 men blackened their hands and faces, and brought a slur on the good name of the Indian community.
 WHO IS GUILTY HERE?
 This question will arise in the mind of every Indian. I myself feel that we cannot absolve those who applied for registration. None could have blamed them if, convinced that the new law was good and that there was no humiliation in submitting to it, they had, in broad daylight, gone to the Permit Office to apply for their title-deed of slavery. But they believed it to be a shameful thing and that is why they decided to take out permits secretly at night. This proves that they knew their guilt and hence they should be considered to have committed an offence against the Indian community. The Permit Officers can be held to be as much at fault as the Indian culprits and even more. Going to people’s shops at night to receive in secret applications for new permits shows that they have been straining every nerve to make people submit to the new law. For they are afraid that their prestige will suffer if the people do not submit to it. If the Government stoops so low, what wonder is there that people are tempted? :
 AS IF THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH
 For such secret registration the pretext is found to have been put forward that the Indian community has held out threats that those who take out new registers will be made to suffer. This  accusation  is entirely false. Trying to hide his own shame in taking out the register, the traitor has levelled false charges against the whole community, and invented lies.
 HAJEE HABIB’S LETTER
 As it is impossible to tolerate such an accusation, Mr. Hajee Habib has addressed the following letter to the Colonial Secretary:libtech_134_footnote
 BUT GOOD COMES OUT OF EVIL
 The fight of the Indian community being righteous, the treachery appears to have led only to a good result. Among those secretly taking out permits was an innocent Indian, named Abdul Karim Jamal. Out of fear and temptation he applied for a permit, but, as he did not belong to the treacherous group, he was arrested on a charge of giving false information in the application. He has been released on a bail of £100 and awaits trial. This has shocked all Pretoria. For, the Indians have found that, in applying for a permit under the new law, the fear was not only that the permit might not be granted, but also that ‘one might have to suffer imprisonment like a criminal. Whether or not Mr. Abdul Karim Jamal is guilty is a separate question. It is obvious that even an innocent person might all of a sudden find himself dragged to the court, so dreadful is this law. Both one’s honour and safety lie in keeping away from the new law. This case should serve as a warning to all. There is no guarantee that even by seeking the title-deed of slavery one can have the right of settling in the Transvaal.
 “COMPASSION IS THE SOURCE OF RELIGION”
 One  should  remember  this  famous  line  of   verselibtech_135_footnote,  and   have compassion on those who have betrayed the Indian community. It is natural that we should feel angry. But we should suppress our anger and believe that it is out of ignorance that they sought disgrace. It should also be remembered that the entire struggle would suffer if, in the course of it, any Indian used violence against another Indian or did him other harm. In this connection I have regretfully to say that Mr. Khamisa sent word to each of his Indian customers that, if they did not apply for the new title-deed of slavery by Monday morning, they should pay up all his dues, failing which he would have summons taken out against them. This created a great stir. But Messrs Essop Mia, Aswat and Omarji persuaded Mr. Khamisa to withdraw the notice given by him.
 TELEGRAMS OF SYMPATHY POUR IN
Telegrams are being received continuously by the leaders in
 
 Pretoria. Some of them strongly denounce the treachery. Congratulatory telegrams have been sent to each of the pickets by Mr. Parsee Rustomjee and the volunteers of Durban. Barbers have received telegrams fromother barbers, advising them to remain firm. Telegrams have also been pouring in from several gentlemen and from such places as Blair, Tongaat, Delagoa Bay, Dundee, Ladysmith, Estcourt and Cape Town.
 Till this evening (Monday), not one Indian has taken out  a permit from the Permit Office.
 HAMIDIA MEETING
 A huge meeting took place on Sunday in the hall of the  Hamidia Islamic Society of Johannesburg amidst great enthusiasm. Mr. Polak explained the position to date. Emam Abdool Cadir Bawazeer presided. Moulvi Hajee Abdul Mukhtiar made a long and effective speech. The action of those who had taken out the register was vehemently denounced at the meeting as a snare. Mr. Polak said that now it would probably be the turn of the Johannesburg District, and that it was therefore necessary to recruit volunteers. He called for the names of those who were ready to enlist as volunteers. Nawab Khan Jamadar was the first to offer himself. He made an impassioned speech. The following were the other names enlisted:
 Messrs Mahomed Hussain, Mir Afzulkhan (Kabuli), Nuruddin, Imamdin, Jamashah, Sahebdin, Musa Mahomed, Alibhai Mahomed, Isap Dasu, Alibhai Ismail, Omar Hasan, Musa Anandji, Ramlagan, Ali Omar, Ismail Mahomedshah, Mahomed Ismail, Suleman Amad Surti.
 After these names were received, it was announced that no more were needed. Great enthusiasm prevailed at the meeting.
 MEETING OF SOUTH INDIANS
 The same evening the South Indians held a meeting. Mr. Polak explained the position fully also to them. The people are full of enthusiasm and spirit. Everyone says that he himself will not invite disgrace by taking out the permit, no matter what others do. At the meeting the following offered to enlist as volunteers:
 Messrs P. K. Naidoo, W. J. R. Naidoo, S. Matthews, S. Lingham,
 D. N. Naidoo, S. Kumaraswami, S. Virasamy, Thambi Naidoo, S. P Padiachy, R. K. Naidoo, R. Thandapani, K. K. Samy, K. N. Dadlani, J.
K. Desai and others.
 WARNING TO THOSE COMING VIA DURBAN
 A correspondent from Volksrust writes to say that the Officer takes away the register and the permit of those coming from Natal,
 telling them that the same should be obtained later from the Pretoria Permit Office. This is obviously improper; it puts people to expense and obliges them to go to the Permit Office. All Indians therefore should take the warning and refrain from going to the Transvaal altogether at the present time. This, too, follows from the new law. It should make us realize the subtlety of the new law.
 VREDEDORP INDIANS
 It has now been decided that the Vrededorp Ordinance will not be put into effect for the time being. From this one need not believe that Indians have specially benefited. The truth is that the whites do not approve of the Ordinance. They are not satisfied with the rights granted by it. They demand more. The Government has agreed to grant them what they want. Accordingly, a new Ordinance will now be framed. Therein, too, the rights of Indian merchants will not be protected. There is no one to listen to the feeble voice of a reed. The Dutch of Vrededorp, though poor, have the right of vote, and they are brave fighters. For them everything will be done. Indians have no vote. As for the sword, perhaps they have not even seen it. If, however, they take courage in both hands and burn the obnoxious Asiatic Act with the fire of gaol-going, that will prove their mettle all right. Otherwise, I for one have no doubt at all that Indians’ rights will vanish for ever.
 ASIATIC ACT IN HOUSE OF COMMONS
 Local papers publish a cablegram stating that Sir William Bull asked a question in the Imperial Parliament about the  Transvaal Indians. In his reply, Mr. Churchill stated that it was found that there was no alternative to finger-prints for registration. Lord Elgin expressed regret for the attitude taken by the Transvaal Government, but stated that, after the Transvaal’s explanation that there was nothing objectionable in this manner of identification, he did not think he could press for a reconsideration of the matter.
 That Lord Elgin expressed regret clearly shows that he himself regards the Act to be oppressive. So, when Indians go to gaol, his sympathy is bound to be with them.
 HARASSMENT BY RAILWAYS
 The following letter has been sent to the railway authorities over the signature of Mr. Polak, the Acting Secretary of the British Indian Association:
 I have the honour to draw your attention to the fact that yesterday after- noon, Mr. Abdool Gani, the late Chairman of my Association, and Mr.
 Goolam Mahomed were refused tickets to travel by the 4.40 train to Pretoria, although they were obliged to go on urgent business, having been telegraphed for.
 May I ask you to be good enough to investigate this matter, as my Association is anxious to be assured that the Administration has no intention to place further restrictions upon the community represented  by  my Association in regard to its public rights.
 This recent example of harassment by the railways clearly shows that no Indian should lose the opportunity of going to gaol so as to open theeyes of the authorities. All these hardships, instead of diminishing, are likely to go on increasing till the Indian community proves its spirit by going to gaol.

informed Indians that the Government was firm in its policy in regard to the Act.
 single voice was raised in the popular Assembly, for whom even Mr. Hosken had not been able to say one word of sympathy there because he felt that he would have to meet a solid phalanx of opposition, should oppose the Law. Under these circumstances, the inevitable they had to submit to was the will of God. If it was His will that every one of the 13,000 Indians should sacrifice everything, should give up whatever he had of monetary wealth accruing to him in this material world, then he must resign himself to the inevitable, and not accept the insult and the degradation that this Law involved. He thought, with all respect, that Mr. Hosken was not in a position to change his skin, nor was he in a position to advise them in a matter of life and death to every Indian who resided in the country.
 He had lived in this country, and had served his fellow-countrymen for thirteen years. (Cheers.) He claimed to be one of the most peaceable men in South Africa, and he had not embarked upon this crusade, he had not embarked upon this advice to his countrymen, without mature thought and deliberation. He had read every sectionof the Asiatic Act and had read almost all Colonial legislation, and he had come deliberately to that conclusion, which he did not think he was likely to alter, that if the Asiatics who resided in the Transvaal submitted to that Law, theirs would be a state of slavery and nothing less.
 And why? He had given a simple illustration to Mr. Hosken’s countrymen when he had been in London. He had said: “Everyone who goes in the street wears a chimney-pot, a silk hat. Supposing that in London they were to pass legislation making it compulsory for every Englishman to wear the silk hat, would not the whole of London go hatless?” This was the position he had put to those friends—only it was absolutely trivial. There, it would be merely a question of hats, yet Englishmen prized their liberty so highly that they would resist in their own country a law which put such compulsion on them, whatever its objects. Here it was not a question of hats, but the badge of slavery on arm and forehead. He asked them not to wear that badge.
 He took the sole responsibility for the advice he had given to his countrymen, but he would also couple that admission with the statement that his countrymen had felt far more severely the degradation involved in that Act than he could ever feel because he knew the loopholes that this Act contained for his countrymen. He knew also that, living in a country like this, they had to make allowance for a certain amount of prejudice, so they had put up with some indignities, some insults, but now the cup was filled to overflowing, and British Indians recognized that it was not possible for them to suffer the degradation involved in the Act and to live in this country. They had deliberately and of their own accord come to the conclusion that it was not possible for them to live in this country. If these were not the feelings of his countrymen in regard to that Act, he would be the first to own his mistake, and he would be the first to comply with the Law and to publicly admit that he had been mistaken and that they had deserved that Ordinance.
 Mr. Essop Mia had placed graphically before them the position. He had shown the difference between the Act and voluntary registration. They had before their
 mind’s eye, and they could picture to themselves, the position in which they would be under voluntary registration and that in which they would be under compulsory registration. It was not for him now to examine the Act in detail, but the Moulvi had drawn one or two comparisons for their edification. Mr. Hosken, not understanding the language, had thought that the Moulvi was resenting a personal grievance, but those who served the community could not afford to have any such personal grievances. What the Moulvi had said was that the Act was despicable, and he (Mr. Gandhi) would say with emphasis, and in all humility, that the Act was so despicable and so wantonly insulting that it even made distinctions between Mahomedans and Christians, it brought Turkish Mahomedans within the provisions of the Act but left Turkish Christians and Jews free. He did not know of any Turkish Mahomedan who had a quarrel to pick with the Turkish Christian or the Turkish Jew, but they had found   it hard to swallow this bitter pill, to swallow this insult.
 And if, in order to eke out a miserable existence in this country, they  submitted to all these things, what warranty, after all, had they that their position would be changed for the better and that there would be restored to them any of the rights of which they had already been deprived? A few unimportant alterations would be made, but they would still have to submit to the deprivation of ownership of property, to segregation in locations and he knew nor what else. This was the position they had to face, and for that reason he had taken the responsibility of advising his countrymen that they ought not to submit to this Act.

 [PRETORIA,
 July 31, 1907]
 Resolution 1: This Mass Meeting of British Indians assembled • in Pretoria hereby notes with deepest regret that there  have  been found in the community some Indians who have so far forgotten themselves and their traditions as to first secretly, and then openly, well knowing the disgrace attached to submission to the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, apply for certificates of registration under it.
 Resolution 2: This Mass Meeting of British Indians assembled in Pretoria congratulates the vast majority of the Indian inhabitants of Pretoria upon having refrained from bringing themselves under the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, and upon  braving the serious consequences of non-submission thereto, and also congratulates, the courageous Indians who, by acting as missionaries to spread a true
 
 knowledge of the provisions of the Act amongst the members of the community, have made possible so noteworthy  a  stand  against injustice and oppression.
 Resolution 3: This Mass Meeting of British Indians assembled in Pretoria respectfully prays that the Government may be pleased to spare the community the suffering involved in non-submission to the Act by accepting the offer of voluntary re-registration outlined in the Chairman’s address, in view of the fact that, in the humble opinion of this Meeting, the Act is unnecessary for the purpose for which it is intended.
 Resolution 4: This Mass Meeting of British Indians assembled in Pretoria hereby authorizes the Chairman to forward copies of the first three resolutions to the Government.

79,"July 	31,1907",STRUGGLE IN TRANSVAAL,"
  July 	31,1907  ... 	If the Government should be willing to give a period of, say, two 	months for voluntary registration, the majority of Indians would 	accept these terms, though there might still remain the difficulty 	of the finger-print system. He admitted that this was aserious 	stumbling-block, and in his opinion they would only get terms after 	they, or many of them, had suffered under the Ordinance.  Rand 	Daily Mail, 1-8-1907         	The month of July has ended. It will remain memorable in the history 	of the Transvaal Indians, perhaps in the history of the Indians in 	the Colony of South Africa. The mass meeting on July 31 marked a 	fitting conclusion to an eventful month. We are happy to find that a 	meeting attended by delegates from all parts of the Transvaal has 	once again condemned the Ordinance unanimously. That means, the 	whole of the Transvaal stands united in its eagerness to court 	imprisonment. However, some persons, not realizing the importance of 	a struggle which will affect the future of Indians in the whole of 	South Africa,    
 have betrayed the community. Their conduct is tantamount to high treason against the motherland. But the number of such persons is very small. Moreover, many of them feel sorry for what they have done. Taking a warning from this, and from the miserable condition of one or two persons whose valid permits were declared to be false, people everywhere in the Transvaal who are still wavering will, we hope, make up their minds to be firm. It is the turn now of Pietersburg and other districts to do what Pretoria has done, and do one better. If this happens, our struggle can have only one result, and that is success. For the present, we only wish to tell the brave friends in Pretoria that, in keeping with the spirit they have shown in July, they hold themselves ready fearlessly for simple or rigorous imprisonment, or for exile, if the Government so chooses; in a word, for any hardship. We are now in the thick of a battle. There is no question of looking back. Our fight is for justice, so that we have the great Creator of the world Himself on our side. In the course of the struggle so far, the Government has climbed down frequently enough. This success is the result of our firmness. We cannot put a limit to what can be done. We offer our sincere congratulations to Pretoria for what it has been able to do, and pray to God that He may always bring succour to those who may be in gaol.

80,,AWAKENING AMONG NATAL INDIANS,"
    
 Time and again we have warned Natal Indians to keep awake. Now we can say with pleasure that they do not seem to be asleep. They are working hard to give help to the Transvaal Indians in every possible manner. While Messrs Dawad Mahomed, Parsee Rustomjee, Dada Osman, Ismail Gora, Dr. Nanji, Dr. Hiramanek  and  others among the Congress leaders are working hard to raise contributions in Durban, Messrs M. C. Anglia, Abdool Cadir and Peeran Mahomed visited Maritzburg with Mr. Tayob Moosa, and raised a good amount in only a couple of days. Following this example, all the Indians in Natal should collect as much as they can in their respective districts. If the Congress leaders have been thus active, the rank  and  file  of Indians have not lagged behind. In addition to the three volunteers keeping a watch over passengers travelling to Johannesburg, Messrs
 
 Hoosen Dawad (son of Mr. Dawad Mahomed), U. M. Shelat, Chhabildas B. Mehta, Ruknuddin and D. K. Gupte have given all their time to Congress work. For several days past telegrams have been sent constantly from here to Pretoria and telegrams from there are being anxiously awaited. From the sympathy thus evinced by Natal Indians, the Transvaal Indians should realize that they are no longer alone in their struggle, but that Indians outside stand by them fearlessly, ready to help in all possible ways.

81,"August 	5, 1907",JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
         SPECTRE 	AT PIETERSBURG    [August 	5, 1907] 
  	The spectre of the Permit Office has now shifted to Pietersburg, and 	by the time this letter appears in print, it will have been known 	whether the Indians are lions or lambs. Though I am writing this as 	early as Monday, I think I can say they are lions. On learning that 	the Permit Office will go to Pietersburg some time between the 7th 	and the 10th to issue the title-deeds of slavery, the  local  	leaders immediately went to Pretoria. Mr. Hajee Habib, the very 	shrewd and energetic Secretary, who had been to Johannesburg on 	business, soon returned to Pretoria to help maintain the confidence 	of the Pietersburg leaders. They have taken up the challenge, 	ensuring a total boycott of the Permit Office at Pietersburg.  WHY 	DID 	SPECTRE 	GO TO 	PIETERSBURG?  	This question will strike everyone. I have to say with regret that 	the blame for this lies with Pietersburg Indians. They did not 	attend the famous mass meeting on July 31. Their telegram was 	lukewarm, and the Indian shops at Pietersburg remained open that 	day, though other shops throughout the Transvaal, including even 	that of Mr. Khamisa, were closed. This naturally led the Government 	to infer that the Pietersburg Indians would be quite ready to wear 	the chain of slavery and accept the registration document which is 	almost like a warrant of death. Moreover, since Mr. Khamisa and  Mr. 	 Hajee Ibrahim had tarnished the name of the Memons, who form the 	bulk of the Indian community at Pietersburg, the Government thought 	that its ammunition would prove effective against Pietersburg and 	that  the  fort of Indian freedom would fall there. 
 But the Government has made a mistake in thinking that the Pietersburg Memon community will follow the example of Mr. Khamisa and Mr. Hajee Ibrahim. I believe that both these Indians are also repenting now. Their new registers have proved too much of a liability to them. Though  no Indian has been avoiding  these gentlemen or doing them any harm, they remain isolated and have to put up with bitter public criticism. No Indian, therefore, will make bold to do what they have done. Moreover, in public at least they have been saying that, though they had themselves soiled their hands and tarnished their faces, let no other Indian do like them.
 CONCESSION TO PRETORIA?
 In its Notice from Pietersburg the Government has now announced that the Pretoria Indians will be free to take out new registers at Pietersburg. I for one take this to be a kind of bondage. Temptation is an evil thing. I consider that taking out of new registers is a crime. To tempt them to commit that crime, the Government has only opened another door for the Pretoria Indians. It will be wrong to regard it as a concession. It is just a snare. For my part,  I  am convinced that no Indian from Pretoria will succumb to  the temptation.
 KARIM JAMAL’S CASE
 Thanks  to  Karim  Jamal’s  caselibtech_141_footnote,  Indians   have   become   more strongly confirmed in their opposition to the new law. To submit to it, they have seen, is to go in for a bad bargain.libtech_142_footnoteThe case against Mr. Karim Jamal has been withdrawn. The public prosecutor admitted that there had been a mistake in instituting the case. How does this help Mr. Karim Jamal? He had to suffer inconvenience and incur monetary loss. Disgusted with the heavy loss and damage, he has withdrawn his application for a register. (See his letter to the Registrar on the subject printed elsewhere.)libtech_143_footnote
 This letter should be a warning to all Indians as to how this law can subject a poor man to hardship.
 WHITE STANDS UP AGAINST FINGER-PRINTS
A white man has been arrested on a charge of theft. Under the
 
 
 gaol regulations, the police have the authority to require finger-prints of a person sent to gaol. In exercise of that authority, the police demanded this man’s finger-prints in the gaol. He refused to give them, and was brought before a magistrate; even then he emphatically refused to give the impressions. As for  obtaining  impressions  by force, there is no authority for it under the law. The magistrate, therefore, sentenced the white to solitary confinement for three days. He bravely suffered the sentence, but refused to give finger-prints.
 MONETARY AID FOR STRUGGLE
 Mr. Bhatt writes to the Association from Waschbank to say that the Indians there are in high spirits and are raising a fund. He has offered whatever help may be necessary when people go to gaol. This is very good news. In this connection I must point out that whatever money is raised in Natal should be forwarded to the Congress Secretary. Likewise, the money collected at other places should be made over to the local associations. If anyone keeps the money with him or if the money raised at a place remains with the local leaders, it will be difficult to send it when needed. It should be so arranged that the demands from the Transvaal are addressed to only one source. This is no time for anyone to think of his importance. All have to do only their duty.
 MASS MEETING
 The mass meeting at Pretoria proved a huge success; one can say that the mass meetings at the Empire Theatre and the Gaiety Theatre were nothing compared to this. Moreover, it is a happy  augury for our ultimate success that the meeting was held in the premises of a building as sacred as a mosque. The editor of Pretoria News personally attended this meeting, while the other meetings were attended by reporters only. At the two earlier mass meetings the local Members of Parliament were not present.
 HOSKEN’S PRESENCE
 This meeting was attended by Mr. Hosken, a prominent Member of Parliament. Mr. Hosken’s speech should add to our strength. He cannot, of course, give any different advice from what he did. He came under instructions from General Botha, General Smuts and Mr. Hull. This shows that our work in the month of July has had its effect on the Government. When two parties are engaged in a struggle, it is usual for each to maintain an extreme position to the very last. Of the two, the party which has right on its side and remains firm till the end will win. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Government should send a message to say that the law would in no case be amended and that
 voluntary registration would not be accepted. No one listened to us hitherto, but now the Government is anxious to find out what we want. Let us regard this as the first step towards success.
 OTHER GOOD OMENS
 Just as I regard the holding of the meeting in a mosque and the presence of Mr. Hosken at the meeting as a happy augury, so also the news which Mr. Hajee Cassim brought to the meeting, that the Government would not send anyone to gaol for the  immediate present, may be taken by some as a good omen. In reality this is bad news, for the sooner the Government took the offensive against us, the quicker would be the solution. But I take it as a favourable circumstance that the news was received on the very day of the meeting. The happiest sign is the cablegram from England received on the morning of July 31 to say that the  South  Africa  British [Indian] Committee had been trying for an interview with Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. This cablegram gladdened the hearts of all. All were gratified to think that they were not going to be entirely forsaken by the Committee.
 CABLEGRAM TO REUTER
 After the meeting was over, the Pretoria Committee sent a long cablegram to Reuter, and another directly to the Committee. This meant an expense of £7. The Committee’s reply to this cablegram states that our question will be discussed in the House of Commons. The question will come up in connection with the loan of £5,000,000 requested by the Transvaal. If this happens, we may expect to gain something. However, no one should depend much on such support. We should not be surprised if we are disappointed in this. The important thing is that everything depends on our own strength. It may be taken for certain that there is no deliverance for us before we come out of the gaol gates.
 MORE AID
 Mr. Motilal Diwan says in a letter that he is prepared to make a personal sacrifice to save the cause of the Transvaal Indians. He is ready to look after the wife and children of any Indian going to gaol, and to proceed to Charlestown to receive them. Such examples are of great help to us.

         JOHANNESBURG,  August 	8, 1907  THE 	PRIVATE 	SECRETARY 	TO GENERAL 	SMUTS 	PRETORIA SIR,  	I have heard from more sources than one that, in the opinion of 	General Smuts, I am responsible for the agitation against the 	Asiatic Law Amendment Act, and that my action is strongly 	disapproved of by him. If the imputation means that my countrymen do 	not resent the Act at all but that I unnecessarily inflame them, I 	venture to repudiate it altogether. On the other hand, if it means 	that I have voiced their sentiments and that I have endeavoured, to 	the best of my ability, to place before them accurately what the Law 	means, I beg to accept the entire responsibility. I feel that, my 	parents having given me a liberal education, and [I] having studied 	to a certain extent modern history, I should be false to myself and 	my country if I did less.  	Relying upon past professional connection with Mr. De Villiers, I 	sought a private interview with him, and requested his unofficial 	intervention with a view to finding a solution of the difficulty. He      
 promised to see General Smuts and let me know. He did so. I was, however, unable to see him personally again. He left a message with his Secretary to the effect that I should approach General Smuts directly, though there was little chance of relief being granted in the direction suggested by me.
 I believe that I am as anxious to serve the Government as I am to serve my countrymen and I feel that the question is one of  very serious and Imperial importance. I, therefore, venture to enclose herewith a hurriedly-drawn draft amendment to the Immigration Restriction Bill. In my humble opinion, it meets the view of the Government entirely, and it removes the stigma which, rightly or wrongly, my countrymen think attaches to them by submission to the Asiatic Law Amendment Act.
 I have seen a cabled summary of General Smuts’ reply to the South Africa British Indian Committee. He has been  pleased  to  remark that co-operation with the leaders of the Indian community is not possible, as they have taken up an attitude of defiance. With deference, I must say that there is hardly any defiance about the attitude, but complete resignation to the will of the Almighty, in whose name they have sworn not to surrender their manliness and self-respect, which, in their opinion, are seriously attacked by the Registration Act.
 I hope that the proposal submitted herewith will be received in the spirit in which it is offered.

85,,MR. HOSKEN’S “INEVITABLE”,"
  
 Mr. Hosken is known all over South Africa to be the friend of the non-white races. He is one of the few men in South Africa who have the courage of their convictions. His exhortations to the historic Mass Meeting of Indians at Pretoria, therefore, deserve most careful attention.
 Let us then analyse the doctrine he laid down, namely, that Indians as an Eastern people, should recognize and bow to the inevitable. By the term, Mr. Hosken meant to convey that the Act, having been demanded by the white people of the Transvaal, and unanimously sanctioned by the local Parliament, was in the nature of an act of God. We are constrained to take exception to the proposition laid down by Mr. Hosken. The honourable gentleman admitted that he himself did not like the Act, and that he would himself, if he could, grant the Indian request. He also admitted that “passive resistance” was a legitimate method of securing redress of a felt grievance. On his own showing, therefore, Mr. Hosken’s contention that the Act is in the nature of an act of God falls to the ground. We, however, go further. No action of a human being is considered by the Eastern mind as a divine dispensation, unless it is intrinsically justifiable. And when an Eastern submits to the apparently inevitable, there is always traceable behind such submission, not a recognition of the Divine hand, but of base selfishness. The spirit is then willing, but the flesh is weak.
 And what is it that Mr. Hosken will have the Transvaal Indians to do? To accept the enslaving Act in order that they [may] be able to exist in that country! In other words, Mr. Hosken, a man of God, advises Indians, for their material good, to forswear their solemn oath and their honour. We answer, in the words of his Master, “Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and everything shall be added unto you.” We believe that, in resisting the wretched  Act, Indians would be seeking the “Kingdom of God”.
 Mr. Hosken says the oath is not binding, because it was ill-taken. But the solemn declaration was made by Indians with due deliberation. And it was not only for their own self-respect, but for that of their dear ones and their country, that they resolved upon resisting the Act and facing imprisonment or worse.
We, therefore, trust that Mr. Hosken will, with his accustomed
 zeal for forlorn causes, study the Asiatic question, and we promise that he will accept the whole contention of the Indian community. He went to the meeting as a messenger of peace from the Government. He will, we doubt not, fulfil the functions of a true mediator, if he will only understand carefully the Indian standpoint.

 "
86,,MR. ALLY’S PROTESTlibtech_150_footnote,"
  
 We commend to the attention of the Transvaal Government the letter Mr. Ally has addressed to the Press. Mr. Ally, it will be remembered, was a delegate to wait on Lord Elgin in connection with the Asiatic Ordinance. The Rand Daily Mail calls it a bitter protest, and so it is. Mr. Ally’s is perhaps an extreme case, but it shows most vividly, as nothing else can show, the suffering the Act is going to cost the community. The objection of the Indian community has been set down as mere sentiment. Mr. Duncan, not knowing what the  Act meant, was good enough to say that the Asiatic objection should be overborne, but we ask whether it is sentiment that has dictated the course adopted by Mr. Ally. Will the Indian community be told that Mr. Ally is probably facing starvation for a foolish sentiment, or will it dawn on Lord Elgin that, after all, even though an Indian, a British subject may be entitled to personal freedom and security wherever the British flag flies?

 "
87,,THE TRANSVAAL INDIANS,"
  
 The Pietersburg notice issued by the  Government  is undoubtedly a feeler, and it seems that the Government are still uncertain whether the feeling of resentment against the Asiatic Act is general and permeates the masses, or whether it is confined to a few “agitators” only. Taken in that light, the Pietersburg notice is justifiable. The reply returned by the Pietersburg Indians should set at rest any doubt lingering in General Smuts, mind. The Pietersburg Indians view the sending of the Registration Office to their town as an infliction to be avoided. We congratulate them on their boldness in having sent the petition to the Government, but we must warn them, as also all other Transvaal Indians, that the struggle before them may be bitter and prolonged before they make a breach in the almost
 
 
 impregnable wall of prejudice that the Government have erected in front of them. There is no remission of sin without shedding of blood. This may be paraphrased for British Indians to mean that there is to be no freedom for British Indians without their  suffering imprisonment, even banishment. They must prove themselves worthy of the relief they are fighting for, before they will get it.

88,,WHAT NEXT,"
  
 The mass meetinglibtech_151_footnotelibtech_152_footnotepassed off very well. Pretoria acted bravely. Several days of August have passed. No one has so far been arrested. What will happen next? We often hear people asking this question. It appears that the Government has no intention of taking any steps on the basis of the Pretoria notice. The intention of the Government appears to be to start arresting people only after all the Indians in the Transvaal have had the opportunity of taking out the title-deed of slavery. The boycott at Pietersburg is now likely to succeed. If  therefore an office is now to be opened, the probability is that it will be opened at Johannesburg, where, after the expiry of the  notice period, the attack will begin. From the reports received, it appears that the Government intends to arrest the leaders first. Such a decision will indeed be realistic. If the Government suspects that the new law is being opposed by the people merely because of incitement by the leaders, the suspicion can be proved baseless if the Indian community remains firm even after the leaders are arrested.

89,,COMMITTEE’S FIGHT,"
  
 The South Africa British Indian Committee has resumed the constitutional fight. There is no doubt at all that it is a result of the mass meeting. Replying to a question by Mr Robertson, Mr. Churchill stated that the Imperial Government considered the situation to have become very serious and that they had instructed Lord Selborne to keep them constantly informed by cablegram. He also indicated that they would do all in their power, short of encroaching upon the rights of a self-governing colony.
 
 Moreover, Mr. Coxlibtech_153_footnotehas given notice of his intention to move that the assistance to the Transvaal in the form of a loan of £5,000,000 should not be given unless the rights of Indians are duly protected.
 These events indicate that the Imperial Government will not let down the Transvaal Indians, provided, of course, that the Transvaal Indians, on their part, do not let themselves down. Everything depends on the strength they show by going to gaol.

90,,GENERAL SMUTS’ REPLY,"
  
 The South Africa British Indian committee wrote a letter to General Botha, to which General Smuts has sent a reply. A telegraphic summary of the reply has appeared in The Star and other newspapers. This reply is a month old, and hence not much weight is  to  be attached to it. Since then much has happened the effects of which cannot be judged. But the reply sent by General Smuts a month ago shows that, if he can help it, he will not permit a single Indian to remain here. Rights in regard to ownership of land are not to be conceded, finger-prints will remain necessary, and tram regulations are in the interests of Indians! The same about railways. What else remains? And yet he argues that, since Indian leaders do not wish to submit to the law, he does not intend to consult them. In other words, he knows well enough himself what needs to be done to reduce the Indian community to slavery.

The harm done by his letterlibtech_154_footnoteto the Committee is partly undone by this letter. Mr. Ally is to go to Cape Town. If he wants, he can render patriotic service there. The Indians of Cape Town have started taking part in the struggle in
 
 
 the Transvaal. Mr. Ally can infuse vigour into this movement. We earnestly hope that he will give a good fight in Cape Town and that our Indian brethren there will seek his help. In this connection we have to point out that those who wish to help must support the gaol resolution, strengthen the spirit of the Transvaal Indians, and give financial help to those who suffer. Anything else that may be done will do harm rather than good.

92,,OUR DUTY,"
  
 In the current issue we publish two letters which mention the names of those who did not close their stores on July 31. We also publish the names we have received of those in Pretoria who have made applications for the title-deed of slavery. It is with exceeding regret that we publish these, but we hold that it is not proper for us to conceal the names of defaulters at a time when a great fight is being put up. We do not entertain any feeling of anger or ill-will against any one of them. However, we believe that by publishing the names in this manner we are rendering patriotic service. This is a time when Indians must cultivate the utmost strength and abjure all selfishness. Such being the case, we publish the names of weak persons, and hope that this will give strength to the others. We shall publish any statement that the persons concerned may have to make, provided it is briefly worded. We shall also publish letters of regret that those who realize their mistake may send us. We only wish them well, considering that they too are our countrymen. We expect that our readers also will have a similar feeling towards them. Anger, malice, arrogance, selfishness, violence—all these are not only useless in our fight—they are positively harmful.

93,,CAPE INDIANS,"
  
 In our issue of July 27, we said that we would consider later what demands the Cape Indians should put up.libtech_155_footnoteWe do so now.
Among the hardships experienced in the Cape, one relates to the
 
 Immigration Law. It obliges an Indian going out of the Cape to take out a temporary pass tenable for a year. If one does not take out such pass and does not know English, one cannot return. In our view such a law is excessively harsh. It is not for a free man to take out such a “ticket of leave”. Those who have earned the right of residence in the Cape should have their pass valid for all time once they take it out. If an Indian merchant stays away for more than a year, should it be impossible for him to return to the Cape to look after his business? The section prescribing such a time-limit should be repealed.
 Moreover, a photograph is required of anyone taking out a temporary pass. In our view, it is more disgraceful to furnish a photograph than to give finger-prints. Such regulations ought to be abolished.
 Another law concerns trading licences. In this matter one should have the right of appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Licensing Officer. Also, the obligation on the hawkers to take out separate licences for each locality should be cancelled.
 Amendments should be suggested to the special regulations pertaining to foot-paths and Locations now in force in East London. Also, a move should be made to have adequate educational facilities provided for the Indian community.
 We hold that votes should be cast in favour of those candidates only who furnish satisfactory answers concerning these matters, and that, in the absence of such candidates, it is a matter of honour and duty for the Indian community not to exercise the vote at all.

94,,ESTCOURT APPEAL,"
  
 We congratulate Estcourt Indians on their winning the appeal in regard to the question of municipal franchise. It has been ruled in this appeal that the Indian community has the right to vote at Local Board elections in Estcourt. The only question that remains is whether the petitioners own property of the requisite value. This success is nothing to make much of, for the Municipal Bill is still under consideration in Britain. But it appears that the Bill will not receive the approval of the Home Government, thanks to the efforts of the Committee. Even then, those who have applied should get their names enrolled in the voters’ list. We do not think taking any further step will be desirable.

95,,ROSS’S LETTER,"
  
 Mr. Ross, the General Manager of the Natal Railways, has sent a blunt refusal to the Indian community. We congratulate the community on receiving such a letter. For, the more they insult our religions and the more they despise the colour of our  skin,  the stronger will be our fight, provided we are in the right. A letter such as Mr. Ross’s shows to what a miserable plight we have been reduced in South Africa. If we do not get our reasonable rights, we shall feel crushed by our own wealth. To a sensible man, money without honour is like a thorn. In the Sahara Desert, anyone with goldbars in his pocket will find them like poison if he can get no drop of water anywhere. Similarly, in this country money without self-respect is likely to be veritable poison. We see no need just at present to take any steps on the letter of Mr. Ross. According to us, the solution of such problems depends on the outcome of the Transvaal struggle. If we beg for them often enough, our Moulvis and Christian and Hindu priests may probably get concession tickets at half rates. However, it is not a material question whether concession tickets are available or not. The real point is that, in the eyes of the whites, we are persons of no consequence and it is precisely this that causes all the mischief. In order that we may count [in their eyes], the only course for the Transvaal Indians is to fight desperately to the last—even unto death—and win glory. We shall then be the equals of those who have votes, though actually we may have none.

We know that the whites are afraid of the industry of Indians. They seem to be afraid of Indian skill also. Thus they appear to be imitating the dog in the manger: they neither eat themselves nor let others do so. This behaviour of the Committee shows that we have only one duty now to win respect and dignity for ourselves. And that is, for the present at least, in the hands of the Transvaal Indians.

 Men and women of India! Listen to what I am saying and oppose this wicked Act. There is an old proverb that those who lose their freedom lose half their virtues. Therefore, come forward to fight for freedom, justice and truth. People of India! Resolve in your mind that it will be far better for the whole nation to die rather than live in such slavery. Fearless Rajputs, Sikhs, Pathans, Gurkhas, patriotic Marathas and Bengalees, spirited Parsis and brave Mahomedans, and last, you mild Jains and patient Hindus, children of a great nation, why do you not live as befits your ancient history? Why do you live thus in slavery? March ahead!
Mrs. Bhicaiji Cama has more than 20 years’ experience of

 JOHANNESBURG,
 August 11, 1907
 The Hamidia Islamic Society has been instilling courage and enthusiasm into the people by holding weekly meetings for the last two months or so. At the time of the mass meeting in Pretoria, it arranged to send 600 men by special train to help the residents of Pretoria. By this the Society has laid the community under obligation. We hope the Society will carry on its useful work. Although some people in Pretoria have registered themselves, they now regret having done so. Our plans have not been upset by this. The people in Pretoria have maintained our reputation, and those in Pietersburg have done even better. It is a matter for congratulation that not a  single  gentleman there has registered himself. Wherever the Government finds a weak spot, it opens a Registration officelibtech_161_footnotelibtech_162_footnote. I think Mr. Chamney might have even been told that the people at Pietersburg were weak and that they did not even attend the mass meeting. So the Government opened an office there. But, fortunately, Mr. Jusab Haji Vali and others got together and emphatically refused  to  submit, saying that they would accept only voluntary registration. They said that they would not submit to the poisonous law even if the Government deported them or sent them to gaol. The Government is now betraying signs of weakness. For, the two men who were in the Pietersburg gaol were induced somehow to give their finger-prints. This too is a disgraceful thing.
 The Zoutpansberg Review points out that the Indian community is shrewd and capable, and it should be dealt with carefully. Our London Committee has also been very active these days. All this is the result of the mass meeting. We have thus begun to receive help from all sides. Even so, we must bear in mind that some of us will have to
 
 go to gaol. In that case, it is probable that I shall be the first to be arrested. The same is true of other leaders. But we are bound to win if you sustain the courage you have so far shown, even though they should lay hands on me and on the other leaders. They threaten us about the licences. But they are making a mistake. We can carry on business without licences. For this they may impose a fine on us and, if we do not pay it, they can send us to prison. But there is nothing in the Licensing Act to authorize them to deport us. So, let us notbe afraid on this score either. Now the Registration Office will be moved to Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp. We shall go there, if invited. Otherwise, there is no need to do so.

         TO THE 	EDITOR [RAND 	DAILY MAIL] SIR,  JOHANNESBURG,  August 	12, 1907 
  	You have commenced your special article on the Asiatic Act with the 	inflammatory heading, “Indians Will Not Pay Debts”. The 	restrained language in this article shows that it is not ill meant. 	At thesame time, it would certainly have been better and more 	serviceable to your readers if you had refrained from giving 	currency to what appears to be a fiction, until you had seen the 	leaders of the British Indian community, whose opinion, evidently, 	you did not know.  	I may now be allowed to state that there is not, so far as I am 	aware, a single Indian of standing who has ever made a statement to 	the effect that every Indian “who is thrown into prison for 	passive resistance or loses his trading or hawking licence shall 	refuse to pay his debts”. This would be quite contrary to the 	spirit of our struggle. We have undertaken it with a view to 	suffering ourselves, placing our sole reliance upon God. It would, 	therefore, be wicked if we were to cherish the thought and to 	repudiate our just debts. It is our belief, whether we be Mahomedans 	or Hindus, that all debts that are not paid in our present life will 	have to be liquidated with severe penalty in our next. On the great 	Judgment Day, we shall have to answer for our delinquencies, 	non-payment of debts not being the least of them.  	We do want to exert pressure from every side. We undoubtedly want 	Imperial protection no less than the sympathy of the Colonists and 	even the Government, but we have no desire to do so by means that 	cannot be called scrupulously clean and honest. Our one and only 	weapon of defence against what we consider to be an unwarrantable 	attack on our personal freedom and honour is to show the people of 	South Africa and the citizens of the great Empire, of which we claim 	to be members equally with the whites, that we are men enough to 	suffer for what we conscientiously believe to be a great wrong.  	I have seen as many of my fellow-merchants as I hurriedly could. 	They are Messrs M. C. Camroodeen and Co., M. S. Coovadia, 
 M. A. Karodia, A. F. Camay and Co., Amod Moosajee and Co., M. P. Fancy, Mahomed Oosen and Co., and Jussab Ebrahim, and between us we have paid, during the last month and up to today,  roughly speaking, £18,000 to the European wholesale houses whether here or in London. Some of us, in order to prepare for contingencies, have even paid our debts before maturity. It is true that many of us have cancelled orders in view of the struggle. This is only fair to the wholesale houses and to ourselves. We are sorry that, by our so doing, the latter have to suffer in common with us, but that is inevitable.

 THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO GENERAL SMUTS PRETORIA
SIR,
 I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reply to mine of the 8th instant in connection with the Asiatic Law Amendment Act. I beg to tender my thanks to General Smuts for having frankly stated his viewslibtech_165_footnoteabout the Act in question.
 In my humble opinion, the amendments suggested by me would carry out the essential spirit of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, namely, the identification of every Asiatic entitled to remain in the
 
 Asiatic Law Amendment Act and if the resistance of the Indians residing in this country leads to results which they do not seriously face at present, they will have only themselves and their leaders to blame.”
 
 Colony.
 I offer no apology for drawing the General’s attention to the solemn declaration of British Indians with reference to the Act. So far as I am in a position to advise my countrymen, it is not possible for me, be the consequences what they may, to tell them to deviate from such a deliberate declaration, and, if, even at the eleventh hour, it is possible for General Smuts to respect that declaration  without infringing upon the scope of the Act, I venture to request his sympathy and assistance. I have never blinded myself to the probable results of my countrymen’s following the advice given to them by me, namely, that every Indian is liable to undergo imprisonment, and traders and hawkers are liable to be deprived of their trade licences, and leaders to be deported, should the Immigrants’ Restriction Bill be placed on the Statute-book of the Colony. But, with deference, I beg to state that the compliance with the Act would be far worse than anything that could happen to them by non-compliance.
 This correspondence, on my part, is in the nature of a personal appeal to General Smuts, and is private, but, as I am anxious that the intentions of the Government should be as widely and accurately placed before my countrymen as possible, if General Smuts has no objection, I would like to publish this correspondence.libtech_166_footnote

104,,IMPLICATIONS OF INDIAN OFFER,"
  
 The Permit Office has been perambulating in  the  Transvaal. Like touts, officers move from house to house trying to mislead the people and persuading them to take out the registers according to the new law. Moreover, they cross-examine people to know what our demands are. It is therefore necessary for every Indian to know what voluntary registration means. We are glad to see that the common people are being thus put to the test. The new law is such that it is necessary for every Indian to know clearly what it means and judge it independently for himself. It is not surprising that the people are
 
 being tested. If we fail to give proper replies, that will, no doubt, be surprising. Let us therefore consider the implications of voluntary registration.
 In so far as the law is concerned, the Government can compel people to take out new registers. Not only that; it can also insist on their being renewed from time to time. Moreover, people may be required to give their finger-prints at any time. Children’s finger- prints may also be demanded. Finger-prints may be required at the time of taking out a licence. Briefly, the Government has been empo- wered to enforce all the obnoxious provisions of the new law and of the Regulations made under it. This is not acceptable to us. Instead, we say that we are willing, with a view to removing the suspicion of the Government, to exchange our present permits for new ones. The new law should not apply to those who get their permits voluntarily exchanged in this manner. None of its provisions should apply to us. That is, we should not be required to give finger-prints at any and every stage. If every Indian thus voluntarily takes out the new register, the obnoxious law will be altogether nullified. It will apply only to an Indian who, through inadvertence or on purpose, fails to  get  his permit exchanged. There is thus a very great difference between our demand and the law of the Government. To submit to the Government law is like riding an ass. If the Indiancommunity does so, it will invite public ridicule. Our demand means riding an elephant and will bring us honour and regal dignity.
 Apart from this demand, some gentlemen from Pretoria have, through a lawyer, addressed a letter to Mr. Smuts which we may now consider. They have placed before Mr. Smuts a demand for some amendments to the law. We think this is only trifling with the problem. If one is suffering from fistula but treats it as an ordinary abscess, some external application may bring about a superficial healing. And so it happens, sometimes, that a person suffering from fistula believes that he has been radically cured of the disease, but in fact the disease is active under the surface that has healed up. The deluded patient is shocked to find in a few days a fresh abscess appearing at another place. As long as he does not take the treatment for fistula, abscesses go on appearing and subsiding. Similar, we think, is the case with the letter referred to above. The new law, which is like fistula, cannot be treated by a letter which asks for the deletion of two or three things. It is only a palliative and in the long run will do harm. Every Indian should realize that there is no effective treatment for this fistula-like law other than a major Operation with the surgical knife. Hence, whenever questions are asked regarding the new law, we have to state categorically that our demand is nothing short of the repeal of the
 
 entire law. To show that, in case the law is repealed, we have no intention of sheltering liars, we are willing to take out voluntary registers. But after they are taken out, we do not want the constant pinpricks of the law.

105,,CONGRATULATIONS TO PIETERSBURG,"
  
 Pretoria put up a good show. But Pietersburg was beyond praise. Not a single black sheep was found there. The boycott of the Permit Office proved one hundred per cent successful. The Permit Office was sent back as hungry as it had come. Moreover, to prevent that spectre from having a foothold in Pietersburg, they had sent a petition to the Government in advance, stating that they did not want that office  there. No town can do more than this. No town should do less.
 It does not in the least detract from the honour of Pietersburg that permits were forced on two prisoners. When there is a famine in the country, starving people eat all kinds of things to satisfy hunger. A starving dog will not spare even refuse. In like manner, the officers of the murderous Act, deprived of their prey, behaved like starving men by forcing permits on prisoners; it can be seen from this that there isno self-respect in the new permits, only humiliation. We congratulate Pietersburg. The people of Pietersburg committed a great crime in not closing their shops on the last day of July; they have now atoned for that, thereby rejoining the ranks of other brave Indians. In this hour of glory, they must remember that the real struggle is yet to come. The time is drawing near when people will have to go to gaol and show that their country is dearer to them than wealth and position. At that time, too, we trust Pietersburg will respond bravely.

106,,HANUMAN’S TAIL,"
  
 It is said that when Hanuman [the Monkey-God of the Ramayana,] desired to set Lanka on fire, his tail grew heavier in weight as he went further.libtech_167_footnotelibtech_168_footnotelibtech_169_footnoteSimilarly, the Office for new registers, as it travels further, carries a greater and greater burden with it. When the
 
 Pretoria Notice was issued, all Indians at Pretoria were required to register themselves. When the Office went to Pietersburg, the right to register there was extended to the residents of Pretoria also. At Potchefstroom, besides local Indians, Indians of Pretoria and Pietersburg too were allowed to register themselves. At Klerksdorp, Indians from all the three places mentioned above will have the opportunity of taking out the title-deed of slavery. Thus, the tail of the Permit Office is growing longer and longer. We express sympathy for our Indian brethren at Pretoria, for Pretoria will not be let off even when the Office has shifted to the last place. Can it be that this punishment is inflicted on Pretoria just because a somewhat larger number of black sheep were found there? But between the case of Hanuman and that of this Office there is a great difference. The more rags they wound round Hanuman’s tail and the more oil they poured on it, the greater was the fire in the city of Lanka, though Hanuman did not feel its heat. But the task of the Permit Office is to enforce the obnoxious law, and therefore, it will probably happen that both the law and the Office will be burnt to ashes by the travels of the Office. For, it will not be possible to destroy by fire the Lanka of the Indian community. The community is guiltless. The culprit is the incendiary law itself.

107,,WARNING TO NATAL MERCHANTS,"
  
 The Natal Government Gazette has published a Bill which, if passed, will require every merchant intending to sell his business or shop to give a fortnight’s notice through the Gazette and a local newspaper. A similar notice will also have to be published by anyone desiring to take out a new licence. Both these provisions are harsh, but it will not be possible for the Indian community to oppose them as they apply to all. The same Bill also includes another provision to the effect that, unless a special contract exists, it will not be competent for  a court of law to allow more than eight per cent  interest  on time-barred debts. A contract will not be nullified on the ground that the merchant concerned has charged exorbitantly for a particular commodity. This is an official Bill and is likely to be passed.

 We have also heard that at Pietersburg the two Indians undergoing gaol sentences are not the only ones to have registered themselves; there are about four more. If true, this is very regrettable. There are, it appears, some men in the community who  show misguided courage and blacken their faces. At Pretoria the Konkanis have emphatically declared that none of them has applied for the new permit. In Pietersburg, on the other hand, the four men referred to above are also among the signatories to the petition submitted to the Colonial Secretary Both these acts of treachery are very grave. That such traitors are very few is a matter for congratulation. However, the presence of such people in the community should serve as a serious warning to good men. All this reminds one of the story of the axe and its handle. The harm done by the obnoxious law or by  the Government could not be so great as that done by such  men.  A person who openly takes out the new register may be credited with some sort of courage. But what simile shall we use to describe the man who takes out the register stealthily and then parades as respectable?

109,,CONFLAGRATION IN MOROCCO,"
  
 There is a fierce fire raging in Morocco at present. Raisooli has created terror there. At Tangier there are plunder and rapine.  A number of men have been killed. Two hundred women are under arrest. Raping too is going on. The Jews have suffered the most. In Casablanca there is complete anarchy. Such is the news given by Reuter. Reuter further adds that the Sultan of Morocco has stated that, if a European army went there, even the few clans now under his control would get out of hand. We are not in a position to find out how much of this is true. It is said that Sir Harry Maclean has now
 
 been released by Raisooli. A German, writing of Raisooli, describes him as a brave and handsome soldier. As a child he fell into the habit of cattle-lifting. For some time he was appointed Governor of Tangier. But, for some years past, he has been living as an outlaw or dacoit. He had many whites captured. He lives always ready for death, certain that he will meet a violent death at someone’s hands. Attempts to kill Raisooli were made by many, but he is so alert and quick that he eludes everyone. We hope to give later an account of the reasons why such chaos reigns in Morocco and of such other things, so that our readers may be able to judge better what is happening there.

110,,HAGGAR’S NEW STEP,"
  
 Mr. Haggar has been assiduously after Indians. He is always up to something or other. Now he wants to throw out of job the poor Indians working on engines for their livelihood. His new idea is to bring up before the Parliament a Bill preventing any Indian from working except under a European supervisor. If such a law comes into force, it is likely to deprive some Indians of their means of livelihood. But it may be hoped that the Bill will not be passed.

111,,ACT TO PREVENT JUVENILE SMOKING,"
  
 This Act was recently passed by the Natal Parliament. We give below the substance of each section.
  It 	will be 	unlawful for 	any person under 16 	years of 	age to 	smoke tobacco, 	a cigar, 	or a 	cigarette. If 	any tobacco, 	tobacco-pipe, cigar, 	cigarette or 	cigarette-holder is 	found [on such person], 	a white 	police officer may 	take possession of 	the same and hand it 	over to 	the Government.  If 	any school-going 	boy is 	found with a 	cigarette or 	any of 	the other things 	mentioned above, the 	school-teacher shall 	take them away 	and hand 	them over to the 	guardian of 	the boy. 	If any 	students are 	found smoking 	tobacco, they will be 	considered guilty 	of breach 	of school discipline and will be liable to be punished accordingly.  No 	one should 	supply or sell 	tobacco, a 	cigar or 	a cigarette 	to a 	person under 16 	years of 	age without 	a note 	from parents, the 	guardian or 	the employer. 	The note 	or order 	should state 	that the 
 cigarette, etc., is for the use of a person above 16 years of age and that it will be delivered into the hands of the signatory. It will be unlawful to supply or sell cigarettes, etc., to a person under 16 years of age in the absence of such a note. Anyone violating this section will be liable to be punished with a fine up to £5 or imprisonment extending to one month for every offence.
  Any 	person, not 	being a 	parent or 	guardian or 	employer, who 	sends a person 	under 16 	years of 	age to 	buy cigarettes, 	etc., will be liable to be punished 	with a fine 	up to 	£5 or  imprisonment 	extending to 	one month.  If 	in connection with 	this Act there arises 	any doubt 	regarding the 	age of a 	person, the 	apparent age 	of such 	person as 	determined by 	the court 	will be taken 	as correct 	in the 	absence of 	satisfactory evidence to 	the contrary.

112,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
  
 PIETERSBURG IN FULL SPLENDOUR
 Pietersburg’s bravery is being praised everywhere. Now the raid will be on Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp. They cannot do better than Pietersburg. None is to do less than Pietersburg. Both the Press and the public have been stirred by the spirit shown by Pietersburg. The mercury in the Indian barometer has indeed risen. Pietersburg has brought our success a little nearer. At Pietersburg, as at Pretoria, volunteers were enlisted. The following are their names:
 Messrs Hansraj, A. Gakel, D. H. Jooma, Tayob N. Mahomed, Cassim Suleman, A. Desai, Goolab and the Head Volunteer, Mr. Hasim Mahomed Kala.
These heroes deserve praise.
 “WITHOUT BREAKFAST”
 Telegrams of encouragement were received by many Indians, one of whom sent an immediate reply that the Permit Office would have to leave Pietersburg “without breakfast”. That is, Indians are the game the Office is seeking. If no Indians registered themselves, the Office would be considered to have starved. The fast would not be broken, and the Office would therefore have left “without breakfast”.
 The applications for registration made by prisoners must be,  of  course, left out of account.
 TELEGRAM TO PIETERSBURG
 A congratulatory telegram has been despatched by the Association and the Hamidia Society. In its message  of congratulations, the Society says, “If we remain firm to the end, God will grant us success.”libtech_172_footnote
 POTCHEFSTROOM AND KLERKSDORP
 By the end of this week the Office will have shifted to both these places. The Hamidia Society has therefore sent to them the following telegram:libtech_173_footnote
 From both these places immediate replies were received, saying that both were very firm. None was likely to take out new registers. The people there say: “We need no help from Johannesburg. We areloyal to the oath we took at the Empire Theatre.” I wish all Indians would maintain such courage to the end.
 EFFECT OF OUR STRUGGLE
 So far, it may be said, our struggle has had a good effect. It is stated in the Rand Daily Mail that Indians are in debt to the whites, and that if Indians went to gaol or did not get licences, they would not pay their debts. The writer in the Mail has picked up such a rumour, and he says further that there was no knowing the minds of the Indian leaders. The white merchants seem to have been scared by such news. This should be taken as a good result. Now they do not ridicule us but recognize that the situation is delicate. Moreover, the writer in the Mail adds that the Indians are being helped by very influential men in England. He says that Mr. Ritch has been working in their behalf, and that a hundred Members of parliament have expressed their intention to oppose the loan of £5,000,000 to the Transvaal if Indian grievances are not redressed.
 ESSOP MIA’S REPLY
 To the above mentioned article, Mr. Essop Mia has replied as under:libtech_174_footnote
 COMMENT BY “THE STAR”
 
 
 Immediately, The Star published a long note on the Daily Mail
article. It is given below:libtech_175_footnote
 The passive resistance movement initiated by the British Indian Association has so far been effective, and the leaders of the Indians are sanguine that the Act will not be enforced: to its final issue—the  imprisonment and expulsion of those who have  not  complied  with compulsory registration. It is held that the methods resorted to in the capital to induce the Indians to comply with the new law resulted in only about 70 registering. The Indians in Pietersburg and Zoutpansberg refused to register. Their brethren of Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp have notified their intention of falling into line. The Indians in Johannesburg are numerous, and in many instances wealthy, and they have resolved to resist the law. A good deal of speculation is being indulged in among Indians as to whether the Government will extend the operation of the Act to Johannesburg. The Government is proceeding gradually, and when Mr. Chamney, of the Indian Registration Office, reports, some definite action will be taken, So far there  is  no  indication that the Government will hesitate in requiring the Indians in Johannesburg to register.
 Indian merchants arc gradually preparing for the eventuality that may require their leaving the country. Mr. Chamnay, a Parsee, and a senior partner in Chamnay & Co., wholesale merchants, informed a Star representative: today that he has cancelled his oversea orders, and is reducing his stock to such dimensions that it can be easily handled. His example is being generally followed. At the same time the Indian merchants give an emphatic denial to the statement published by a contemporary that they are refusing to pay their debts or contemplate doing so. One merchant paid bills this morning aggrega- ting ,£437, and last week he met accounts standing at £681. Another paid
 £700 this morning. No such advice has been tendered to any class of Indians by the Association, and the executive were astonished at the suggestion.
 Mr. M. K. Gandhi, the well-known Indian barrister, is the leader of the passive resistance movement. He has certainly marshalled his forces well, and the Indians as a rule are prepared to follow him to the extreme.
 All this proves that the strength displayed by Indians is now bearing fruit.
 VREDEDORP ORDINANCE
 The problem of this Ordinance is now over. The original [Bill] has been dropped and a new one passed. According to this, it will not be possible to oust Indians for four years, and after that period compensation will be allowed for damages suffered by Indians. As a notice of four years is given, the compensation will include not the
 
 loss of trade or dues, but the value of buildings constructed. Therefore, Vrededorp Indian merchants should now take it that they have been given four years’ respite. The credit for this success goes to Mr. Ritch. This is the fruit of his persevering work in England. The provision that, after four years, no Coloured person will be able to stay except as a servant has been retained. That provision will not be removed. This is shown by Mr. Smuts’ reply. But four years is a long period. “If the Indian heroes go to the gaol-palace,”libtech_176_footnotelibtech_177_footnoteIndians may be able to stay on at Vrededorp also. That would be an extra gain, of course, a gift in addition to the salver of pearls.
 M. S. COOVADIA
 News is received from home that the wife of Mr. M. S. Coovadia, the Treasurer of the Association, has passed away. I am grieved to give this information and condole with Mr. Coovadia in his bereavement.
 MAHOMED ESSOP SHAHERI
 Mr. Mahomed Essop Shaheri, who is a member of the Hamidia Islamic Society, is going on a pilgrimage to Mecca towards the end of this month. I wish him success in his undertaking.
 HAMIDIA MEETING
 The Hamidia Islamic Society has been exerting itself with full vigour in the matter of the new law. Every week it holds meetings which Indians of all communities attend. At the meeting held last Sunday, Emam Abdool Cadir took the chair. Mr. Gandhi explained the position. He was followed by Mr. Essop Mia. He said that people must maintain all their courage even if Mr. Gandhi were to be gaoled or deported this time. Money also was needed, and those who had it ought to give it. Thereafter the meeting was addressed by Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar and Maharaj Ram Sundar Pundit. After a short speech by Mr. Amod Coovadia, praising the  efforts  of Mr. Polak, the Chairman declared the meeting closed.
 WHAT ABOUT DEPENDANTS OF THOSE GOING TO GAOL?
 The reply to this question has been given several times in these columns. But the question is asked again and hence I repeat the reply. As I understand the matter, those who are ready to go to gaol will have
 
 
 made all possible arrangements. The responsibility to be borne by the community will therefore be limited. It will not happen that all the men in an establishment or a locality are arrested at the same time. If this assumption is right, the families and property of those who are arrested will be looked after by their friends and relatives. We know that this is what happens when a person is arrested under some other law. However, that is not enough. The Association will indeed look after the affairs of anyone arrested for defying the new law. Where his family lives, what its condition is, and whether there is anyone to look after it—the Association will make all these inquiries. In case the family is poor, arrangements for its maintenance will be made. In other words, the man arrested under the new law stands the chance of double aid: his shop and family will be looked after to his satisfaction, and if the occasion requires it, he will have the  benefit  of the donations that may be received as a result of the offers made by brave men like Mr. Parsee Rustomjee. In this struggle we are to sacrifice ourselves for the sake of truth. Hence, at every step, we shall receive God’s help. Such help He does not Himself give by coming down into this world in person. Rather, living in the hearts of men, He inspires them to do deeds of benefaction. The fact that questions such as the above are raised shows that this is the first time that we have undertaken public work of such magnitude. There is, therefore, some reason for fear. But a little reflection will make it plain to all that there is no reason for losing one’s nerve. The question has also been asked as to what will happen if all the 13,000 Indians are sent to gaol simultaneously, Who willthen look after the children? This question results from sheer fear. Such a question will never occur to anyone with the slightest faith in God. How should it then be raised by the Indian, who always lives in fear of God? We shall not have the good fortune of 13,000 Indians being arrested simultaneously; and in case this happens, let us all remember that there is the Almighty to look after those that may be left behind. If such a question can be asked, one may as well ask who will look after the dependants if, with an earthquake, all the 13,000 Indians were to disappear. What great crime have the arrested persons committed that their children or their property alone should go uncared for? But supposing they have to suffer this, why should we not render that much patriotic service? If we do not, how shall we command respect and honour? How shall we be regarded as patriots? Therefore:
 If the lamp of love is lighted in the heart, Love dearer than life,
On the side of courage will the Almighty be,
 It’s ever so, my friends.
 BRAVE INDIAN
 Having been asked at the Permit Office to give his finger prints, Bakhtawar, an Indian from Calcutta, refused to comply. Then he was asked to apply under the new law. This too he refused to do. Every Indian ought to have such courage.
 EFFORTS IN LONDON
 A vigorous agitation is being carried on in London against the obnoxious law. Questions are constantly being asked by many Members [in Parliament]. In reply to one question, Mr. Churchill said that the Imperial Government could not interfere with the implementation of the law. I find that people have been a little scared by such a reply. But there is no reason for being scared. For, in the first place, we are relying on our own courage in carrying on the fight. Whether the Imperial Government intervenes or not, we shall not do what we believe to be evil. In the second place, though the Government may not interfere with the enactment of the law, it cannot but do so if the law results in oppression. If it does not, its prestige will be lost and ultimately the British Empire will come to an end. The only interpretation I can put on Mr. Churchill’s reply is that, whatever his public utterances, it will be impossible for him  to  avoid intervention at the right time. That right time will come after we go to gaol.
 NEED FOR CAUTION
 The case against Mr. Suleman Wadi of Krugersdorp for selling liquor to a Native was heard on Wednesday. Two white and two Native detectives deposed that he had sold half a bottle of liquor. Mr. Stegmann and Mr. Gandhi appeared on his behalf. They tried hard. It was said in evidence that the sale of liquor was against religion. The bank accountant and other whites deposed in their evidence that Mr. Wadi was a very respectable person. The fact appears to be that the case against Mr. Wadi has been concocted and that he is innocent. However, the magistrate found him guilty and sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment. Mr. Wadi has gone in appeal.  The result cannot be predicted. But every Indian has to be cautious. The whites as well as the Natives will not be afraid of trapping other people to serve their own interest. As Mr. Wadi is innocent, he has nothing to be ashamed of. Shame lies not in being gaoled, but in committing a crime. It is true that he has been put to unnecessary expense and that people not knowing the facts may think ill of him.

       THE 	EDITOR INDIAN 	OPINION SIR,  JOHANNESBURG,  August 	17, 1907 
  	I beg to enclose herewith for publication copy of the 	correspondencelibtech_178_footnotelibtech_179_footnotethat has passed between General Smuts and myself 	regarding the Asiatic Law Amendment Act. The question, in my humble 	opinion, has assumed more than parochial importance. Up to the last 	moment, I shall continue to believe that the humanity of the 	Colonists will get the upper hand of their prejudice and that, if my 	countrymen undergo the suffering they seem to have resolved upon 	doing, the justice of their claims will be recognised. But, whether 	this is so or not, I can only give one advice, and that is to prefer 	fearlessly the fulfilment of their solemn declaration to serving 	their self-interest.  	It is, therefore, necessary that my countrymen should know the 	emphatic warninglibtech_180_footnotelibtech_181_footnotegiven by General Smuts in  his  letter.  It  is  also, 	perhaps, necessary for the public, in whose name the Act has been 	passedand is being administered, to know that the alternative I have 	humbly ventured to offer completely meets the difficulty. It 	identifies every Asiatic resident in the Colony and, unlike the 	Asiatic Act, it determines once for all the number of Asiatics who 	(except those few who may be able to take advantage of the 	educational clause of the Immigration Bill) will be entitled to 	remain in the  Colony.  The bedrock question, therefore, so far as I 	am in a position to see, is not one of finger-prints or other 	details, but it is, broadly, whether the Government should at all 	meet Indian sentiment,  unrepresented though Indians are at the 	polls, or whether, if the Government do not, Indians, to be true to 	their God and themselves, will sacrifice all.

              TO THE 	EDITOR THE 	STAR [JOHANNESBURG] SIR,         JOHANNESBURG,  August 	19, 1907 
  	In honouring by a leaderette what you please to call my “scheme”libtech_183_footnotelibtech_184_footnotewith 	reference to the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, you have done it and me 	less than justice by studying it superficially. By admitting the 	clauses, as per my draft, into the Immigration Bill, the Government 	get the legal right to recall every permit and, in place thereof, to 	issue certificates of domicile to every bona fide Asiatic 	resident of the Transvaal. What form such certificates should take 	has, if you will re-read my draft, been left to the Government to 	fix by regulation. The question, therefore, of finger-prints is not 	made an issue at all nor, so far as I am concerned, has it ever been 	a fundamental point, the main objection being against the compulsion 	and the odour of criminality about the Act. The draft submitted by 	me would enable the Government to ascertain the exact number of 	Asiatics entitled to claim domiciliary rights in the Colony andsuch 	Asiatics would be completely identified. What the draft does leave 	out are the elaborate machinery and the penalties provided in the 	Asiatic Registration Act, and it leaves children under the age of 16 	free from molestation, and avoids the pin-prick inspection, with the 	power to take, at every street corner, identification particulars 	contemplated by the Registration Act. But I submit that any 	surreptitious entry on the part of children is completely checked by 	reason of the provision that, on attaining the age of 16 years, they 	must also take out certificates of domicile, and by stating on the 	certificates of domicile the number of children under 16 years. But, 	if my scheme be considered faulty, the principle of embodying 	identification legislation in the Immigration     
 Bill can hardly be so considered, and any defects that I may have overlooked can be remedied. The question, therefore, still remains whether the public will take sufficient interest in the welfare of Indian subjects of His Majesty to seriously study the alternative proposed.
 With reference to the other portion of your leaderettelibtech_185_footnote,  I  can only say that, if an honourable  status  be  [not]libtech_186_footnoteguaranteed  to  my countrymen, no matter how humble they may be, imprisonment, deportation, and any other similar calamity would be comparatively a boon as against a surrender of their self-respect and a reversal of their solemn declaration. Of one thing I can give an emphatic assurance, namely, that there is not a single Indian who does not dislike the Act from the bottom of his heart. I know most of those who have accepted registration under the Act in Pretoria, and I know this that they admit having committed a crime against their nationality and their God, but they have done so because, in their own words, they prized their pockets more than their honour.
 I am, etc.,

 JOHANNESBURG,
 August 19, 1907
 We, the undersigned Mahomedan merchants, and being Chairman, Secretary, and members of the Hamidia Islamic Society of
 
 the Transvaal, hereby bring to your  notice the state to which Mahomedan Indians will be reduced under the Asiatic Law Amendment Act. We presume that you have acquainted yourself with the principal objections to the Act. But we will draw your attention to one especially which affects us as Moslems. It is the section which applies the Act to Turkish Mahomedans, whereas it exempts Turkish Christians and Jews.
 The Act, indeed, applies to all Indians and, therefore, the whole of the Indian public is concerned with it. But it applies with double rigour to the Mahomedans in that it specially insults our religion and hurts the self-respect of Mahomedan Indians more than others in that they form the wealthier and more respectable portion of the community.
 We may state that, fortunately, in South Africa, there is no antipathy between Mahomedans and Hindus. We all live together in peace and friendship as Indians, and associate together with freedom and carry on a joint battle against prejudice and oppression against us. If, therefore, we lay stress upon the grievance as it affects us, we do so only in order to draw the attention of Mahomedans all over India to our precarious position, in order that we secure your most active assistance in our struggle. And we venture to ask you, as Mahomedans and Indians, to extend to us your sympathy by pleading our case before the Government and in any other manner you may consider desirable. Whilst we are receiving much help from England, even the white Colonists who sympathise with us ask what India, our Motherland, is doing for us.

What I have suggested is not a repeal of some of the 	provisions of the Asiatic Act, and thus having a little of that and 	more of the Immigration Bill, but a total repeal of the former, 	holding, as I do, that my proposal gives everything to the Colonists 	without giving serious offence to my countrymen. It is not possible 	for me to burden you with long extracts from what has been written 	by my fellow-workers and myself to show that, though the question of 	finger-prints has always been treated as a very serious incident in 	a highly objectionable Act, it has never been as one of paramount 	importance per se, except when it was intended to operate as 	a compulsory requirement. You will further easily recollect the fact 	that we voluntarily attached finger-prints to the permits that were 	issued under Lord Milner’s advice.libtech_191_footnotelibtech_192_footnoteThen 	it was a matter of doing it voluntarily and then, too, of giving 	[impression of] only one thumb.

 P. O. BOX 6522, JOHANNESBURG, August 23, 1907
TO
 THE RIGHT HON’BLE THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES
LONDON
 THE PETITION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BRITISH INDIAN ASSOCIATION OF THE TRANSVAAL
HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT:
 The Committee of the British Indian Association of the Trans- vaal respectfully approaches His Majesty’s Government regarding the Immigrants’ Restriction Bill passed by the Transvaal Parliament.
 The said Committee humbly approached both Houses of the said Parliament with respect to the measure, as will more fully appear on reference to copies of the petitionslibtech_194_footnotepresented to the said Houses and annexed hereto, marked A and B.
 The said Committee respectfully submits that the said Bill is open to objection on the following grounds, in that:
  It 		gives permanence to 		the Asiatic Law 		Amendment Act.  It 		disregards the 		right of 		residence of 		those British 		Indians who 		settled in 		the Transvaal 		before the 		war and, in many 		cases, even paid £3 		as the price of 		their residence in 		virtue of 		Law 3 		of 1885, 		but who have 		not been 		able to return 		to the Transvaal 		either because they, 		having applied, 		have not received 		permits to return, 		or because 		they have 		not yet 		applied for 		such permits 		under the 		Peace Preservation Ordinance.  It 		does not recognise 		any of 		the Indian 		languages as part 		of the 		educational test 		required by the Bill. Sub-section 4 of Section 2libtech_195_footnotelibtech_196_footnoteof the Bill requires even Indians  
 
 to Transvaal Legislative Council”, 22-7-1907
 who may pass the education test prescribed by the Bill to be subject to the Asiatic Law Amendment Act.
   It 		makes no 		provision for 		facilities to 		the Indian 		merchants already 		settled in the 		Transvaal for 		temporarily importing 		confidential clerks and 		assistants or domestic servants.  Sub-section 		C of 		Section 6 		of the 		Bill gives the 		power for 		physical and 		forcible deportation 		of those 		affected by the 		Asiatic Law Amendment Act.  
 ARGUMENT ON THE ABOVE
 The said Committee would now crave leave to discuss seriatim the aforementioned grounds of objection.
 FIRST GROUND
 As His Majesty’s Government is aware, the Asiatic Law Amendment Act continues to cause the greatest irritation to the British Indian community residing in the Transvaal. Its provisions are felt to be so insulting and injurious to the self-respect of that community, that many of its members, rather than accept registration under it, are prepared humbly to suffer the penalty of non-registration, even at the risk of losing all their worldly prospects. The measure, when it was first introduced, was meant to be of a temporary nature, and was resorted to in order not to anticipate the verdict of a popularly elected Assembly on Asiatic Immigration, and in the absence of any other law like the Bill under discussion. The very first section of the Bill renders the Asiatic Law Amendment Act permanent, and retains the provisions also of the Peace Preservation Ordinance, in so far as they may be necessary for the administration of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act.
 SECOND GROUND
 It is common knowledge that many British Indians who left the Transvaal at the outbreak of hostilities have not yet returned to the country of their adoption. Many of them paid £3 to the old Dutch Government for the purpose of settling in the country. Owing to the serious obstacles placed in the way of their getting permits under the Peace Preservation Ordinance—although European aliens received them practically for the asking—they have not yet been able to return to the Transvaal. Some of them have not even applied. These refugees would, under the Bill, become prohibited immigrants for want of knowledge of some European language. The prohibition will operate very harshly against deserving British subjects  possessing  vested rights. In thus cancelling the right of domicile, the Bill goes further than similar legislation in [the] Cape Colony.
 
 THIRD GROUND
 In refusing to recognise Indian languages, the Bill draws an invidious and unjustifiable distinction.
 FOURTH GROUND
 In the humble opinion of the said Committee, Sub-section 4 of Section 2 is very vague and difficult of interpretation. It is, however, evident that it aims, amongst other things, at Indians of attainments. By requiring them to comply with the terms of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, it takes away with the other hand what it gives with the one, for it is hardly conceivable that any Indian, having received a liberal education, will ever accept the terms of that Act. Nor is it possible to see any reason for subjecting such Indians to the Act, whose object is to identify Indian residents in the Transvaal, for such Indians, by reason of their knowledge of a European language, carry on their own persons marks of identification. The Asiatic Law Amendment Act is supposed to be necessary because of the illiteracy of the majority of Asiatics residing in the Colony. To require educated Indians to comply with the Act is, in the humble opinion of the said Committee, a wanton insult, and an indirect mode of depriving Indians of the benefit of the educational clause of the Bill.
 FIFTH GROUND
 It cannot be denied that want of facilities to Indians entitled to reside in the Transvaal to import temporary assistance would be a serious grievance.
 SIXTH GROUND
 Sub-section (c) of Section 6 did not appear in the original draft. As has been pointed out above, Indians in the Transvaal at carrying on a life-and-death struggle in respect of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act. It is surmised that thousands of Indians are prepared to suffer the hardships of imprisonment rather than submit to the said Act. To many the Transvaal is their home, where they earn an honest livelihood. For them to be turned out of the country is to make them, perhaps, face starvation, certainly to ruin their prospects in life. Whilst the Asiatic Law Amendment Act provides for a notice of removal from the Colony for failure to take out the registration certificate required to be taken out by the Act, disregard of such notice renders the delinquent liable to be imprisoned. Sub-section (c) above referred to gives the local Government power to physically and forcibly deport at his own expense any person disregarding notice of removal under
 the Asiatic Law Amendment Act. Thus, it is humbly submitted that the sub-section in question is not only a cruel provision in itself, but it is also extremely unfair, in that it indirectly amends the Asiatic Law Amendment Act very greatly to the disadvantage of those affected by it. The said Committee feels sure that, had such an amendment been made in the Act itself, it would not have received the Royal sanction. The said Committee, therefore, trusts that the method adopted under the said sub-section to take extraordinary powers under the said Act will be considered by His Majesty’s Government to be much more objectionable. Moreover, the effect of forcible deportation would amount to a confiscation of the property of the deported, and there seems to be no place provided to deport persons to. The Cape and Natal will not receive such persons. These would, therefore,  be forcibly sent back to India to face starvation. This deportation for a venial offence (if it be an offence at all) will, therefore, be much worse than deportation for heinous offences, for, in the latter, the persons condemned are at least housed and fed.
 GENERAL REMARKS
 The said Committee is humbly of opinion that, since the British occupation of the country, His Majesty’s Government have neglected or disregarded the interests of British Indians, as being the weaker party, in deference to the clamours of interested persons, because they happened to be strong, and this in despite of repeated promises and assurances made and given to the Indians. The said Committee, moreover, respectfully draws the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the fact that Indians are totally unrepresented in the House of Assembly, that not a word was said by any member thereof in favour of the petition presented on its behalf to that Honourable House, and that a similar fate overtook a similar petition presented to the Honourable the Legislative Council, although that Honourable House has been constituted for, among other things, the protection of interests not represented in the Lower and Elected House. Under the circumstances, the said Committee respectfully submits that British Indians have a right to receive special protection from His Majesty’s Government as the central power in the Empire.
 PRAYER
 The said Committee, therefore, respectfully prays that the said Bill may be disallowed and that the good offices of His Majesty’s
 
 Government be used to secure such an amendment of the Bill as to relieve the present tension adversely affecting Indian subjects of His Majesty the King-Emperor owing to the Asiatic Law Amendment Act.
 But, if His Majesty’s Government find it impossible to secure relief for the community represented by the said Committee, in its humble opinion, it were better for them and for the sake of peace within the Empire that Indian subjects of the Crown were withdrawn from the Transvaal and fully compensated for dispossession of vested and acquired rights, either from the local or the Imperial Exchequer.
 And for this act of justice and mercy, the petitioner shall as in duty bound for ever pray, etc.

120,,THE SUGGESTED COMPROMISE,"
       	We publish in another column correspondence that has passed between 	the Transvaal Colonial Secretary  and  Mr.  Gandhi.libtech_199_footnotelibtech_200_footnoteIt 	 is  a great pity that General Smuts has not accepted the suggestion 	made by Mr. Gandhi. Although it is not made in the name of the 	community, we think that it affords either party a safe way out of a 	serious difficulty. General Smuts relies upon his ability to enforce 	the law in full and, therefore, rejects Mr. Gandhi’s proposal. We 	cannot help remarking that the rejection of so reasonable a solution 	shows in what low esteem Indians in the Transvaal are held by 	General Smuts. Accordingly, we consider that it is now more than 	ever the dutyof Indians in the Transvaal to prosecute their campaign 	 of non-submission to the law to the uttermost end. The fixed 	determina- tion of the Transvaal Government can do no harm to those 	Indians who are already reconciled to sacrifice, no matter how 	great. Neither imprisonment nor deportation need occasion the 	slightest fear in the minds of those Indians who place their honour 	above everything else.  	Mr. Gandhi has raised, in submitting his draft, one main issue, 	namely, whether the local Government will condescend to consult the 	wishes and sentiments of the Indian community in carrying out their      
 intention of identifying those Indians who are entitled to reside in the Transvaal. General Smuts says no. It is now for Indians to give their answer. It is open to them to lead a life of utter degradation in the Transvaal, or to make a supreme effort to be counted as human beings and citizens of the British Empire.

121,,OUTSPOKEN SYMPATHY,"
  
 The Friend, of Bloemfontein, has performed a public service and has earned the sincere gratitude of British Indians by the warm-hearted way in which it has approved of the manner whereby our Transvaal brethren have shown their abhorrence of a measure repugnant to their self-respect. The Friend has demonstrated its courage and public spirit by devoting a series of leading articles to a consideration of the subject from which it concludes that British Indians are perfectly justified in protesting, by means of “passive resistance”, against a humiliating law. We commend The Friend’s remarkslibtech_201_footnotelibtech_202_footnote,  which  appear  elsewhere,  to  the   notice   of   our   Transvaal contemporaries.

122,,SUGGESTION TO READERS,"
  
 In our opinion, the Gujarati section of Indian Opinion is at present rendering invaluable service. This claim will probably appear exaggerated. However, the statement is  justified.  The  Transvaal Indians are at present carrying on a heroic struggle and this paper is engaged in furthering that struggle in every possible manner. We therefore deem it to be the duty of every Indian to read every line of it pertaining to the struggle. Whatever is read is afterwards to be acted upon, and the issue, after being read, is to be preserved and not thrownaway.We recommend that certain articles  and  translations should be read and re-read. Moreover, our cause needs to  be  discussed in every home in India. Our readers can do much to bring this about. They can send the required number of copies of Indian Opinion to their friends and, advising them to read them, seek all possible help from them. The present issue includes a letter addressed
 
 by  the  Hamidia  Islamic  Society  to   Indian   Muslims.libtech_203_footnoteWe  think   it necessary that hundreds of copies of this number should be sent out to India.

123,,SOUTH AFRICA BRITISH INDIAN COMMITTEE,"
  
 This Committee has been working very hard. It  was  only through its efforts that the Vrededorp Indians were saved from ruin. The Committee is still continuing its helpful work. Mr. Ritch is indefatigable. Obviously the Committee needs more money for its work. Considerable monetary aid has been sent from the Transvaal. More help from that source should not be expected at present. The Transvaal fight is a fight for the whole of South Africa. We therefore urge the Natal Indian Congress to send more money. Our brethren in the Cape have not at all done their duty in this matter. It will not be out of place for them and for the friends in Delagoa Bay to raise contributions and send some money. That will prove that they too are ready to help.

 "
124,,MR. GANDHI’S SUGGESTION,"
  
 The letter addressed by Mr. Gandhi to General Smuts and the reply  and  the  counter-replylibtech_204_footnotethat  followed  have  been   commented upon in the Leader, The Star and the [Rand] Daily Mail. General Smuts’ letter is a downright threat. It proves that it is quite a difficult thing to implement the law. One can send a score or two to prison. But however brave, General Smuts cannot have the courage to punish thousands of men. He therefore asserts that the law will be fully enforced. If that is so, why has he been sitting still so long? Why are changes being made in the immigration law? Why are his officersso anxious to issue new registers? There is a big difference between the courage he professes and his actual deeds. He could not have given a reply other than the one he has. For, the battle is on at present, and for the time being he has got to keep up appearances. It remains to be seen what he can actually do if the Indian community remains
 
 unshaken at the critical moment.
 The Press comments also show that their strategy  has  now shifted from abuse and ridicule to threats. The papers are now trying to persuade us that General Smuts will not yield his point, and therefore the Indian community had better forsake its God and submit to General Smuts’ enslaving law. The Daily Mail goes so far as to ask the Indians, by way of threat, to remember that the Transvaal is inhabited  by  a   large   number   of   barbarous   Kaffirs.libtech_205_footnoteWe  call   this senility. The whites may be said to have grown grey implementing the law, but their object has not been attained so far. They have therefore grown delirious. What otherwise is the connection between our struggle and the Kaffirs? Do they mean to incite them to attack us? Only a man lying ill in bed will utter such words.
 However, in the light of General Smuts’ reply, we are to be particularly careful to remember one thing, viz., that success will be ours only if the Transvaal Indians remain really firm, forsaking their wealth, suffering hardships of gaol life, and taking pride in being deported. All this sacrifice is possible only if one has living faith in God. Everything depends, in the last resort, on each Indian’s faith, be he a Mahomedan or a Hindu. Every misfortune can be conquered with the weapon of faith. That faith is to be proved not by words, but by deeds.

 "
125,,CAN WE MOVE PRIVY COUNCIL?,"
  
 Sir Raymond West has written a letter to Mr. Ritch which is worth reading. Sir Raymond was a Judge of the Bombay High Court. He is a renowned lawyer. He is of opinion that the Indian community can raise the issue that the new law is null and void inasmuch as it is repugnant to British principles. If this can be done, the  step  is doubtless worth taking. But we are sorry to have to say that it will lead to nothing. Eminent lawyers in the Transvaal are against such a move. We can therefore build no hopes on Sir Raymond’s opinion. The real Privy Council of Indians is the courage of the community. And Godis the only Judge who will redress our grievances. Trust in Him is like a great counsel whose pleading will never go in vain. All the same, for the satisfaction of the community a suggestion has been made to the Committee to seek the advice of some prominent counsel in England.
 
 This will need money. Accordingly, if aid is sent to the Committee, as requested by us, it will be possible to ascertain whether a test case can be preferred or not.

126,,CAN OBNOXIOUS LAW BE ENACTED IN NATAL?,"
  
 In reply to Mr. Haggar, Mr. Moore stated that the Natal Govern- ment would consider the introduction of a law in Natal similar to that in the Transvaal. That is the beauty of the obnoxious law. Its stink does not fill the Transvaal alone, but spreads all round like that of a decaying corpse. This move shows
 that 	a great responsibility rests on the Transvaal Indians;  that, 	if the 	Transvaal Indians 	falter, the law will 	be enacted 	everywhere; and  that 	the Transvaal question 	is the 	question of 	the whole of 	South Africa. 
 The Transvaal Indians therefore ought to remain firm despite any possible calamities and the other Indians ought to regard this question as their own and render utmost help.

 We give a translation of an article in The Friend of Bloem- fontein, which we recommend everyone to read with close attention. The name of the paper is The Friend, and it has acted like a friend of the Indian community. It is not likely that any particular good will result from the article. However, the journal wields a large influence. The impression that has been made on the mind of its editor has also been made on the minds of thousands of white men. But they will not speak out yet. They will do it when we begin playing our true part. From the article in The Friend one should know that, if the Indian community now retraces its steps in the least, the Indian nation will beput to shame and its three hundred millions judged by what the
 
 13,000 do here. The question of paying compensation, which the
Friend has raised, is likely to be raised still more forcefully.

130,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
  
 POTCHEFSTROOM AND KLERKSDORP
 From these two places the Permit Office returned without securing any application for registration. The Potchefstroom papers say that the registration officers spent all their time smoking. Not even  a prisoner could be got to register himself. The volunteers at Potchefstroom had already been active. Pietersburg did better than Pretoria; Potchefstroom surpassed Pietersburg; but Klerksdorp
 
 
 excelled them all. For, the Indians at Klerksdorp did not even keep volunteers. They sought no outside help. They did not avail themselves of the help offered, and every Indian there of his own accord boycotted the Permit Office. Thus Klerksdorp stands above them all. Now, which place will the remaining towns excel? And how will they do it? Both these places had received telegramslibtech_210_footnotelibtech_211_footnoteand  they have answered them. Mr. E. N. Patel, an  old  resident  of Potchefstroom, had run up to both places.
 COMMENTS ON LETTER TO SMUTS
 The Leader and The Star have commented on Mr. Gandhi’s letter to General Smuts which has been published. Both papers say that Mr. Gandhi should advise the Indian community to submit to the law, considering General Smuts’ reply to be final, for otherwise the Indian community would come to grief. The advice is all right as far as it goes. But those offering it forget that the Indian community does not depend on General Smuts. It is under the protection of God and not of General Smuts or the whites of the Transvaal. Their eagerness to make us submit to the law shows that they are inwardly afraid of the resistance offered by the Indian community.
 GENERAL SMUTS’ REPLY
 The reply of General Smuts also is the sort of threat of which Indians need not in the least be afraid. His object is to make us accept the law at any cost. That is why he has been threatening us in various ways. He says that the law will be fully enforced. What does that mean? No one imagines that it will not be fully enforced. Everyone knows that not a single article of the law is going to be deleted. But the point is how a law can be enforced against those who will not submit to it. By sentencing them? If so, the Indians. say they fear neither gaol nor deportation. Of course, it will be possible to enforce it against those who are afraid. Such persons are to be taken as lost to us. We know that the law will be enforced against them, and thatis why we have been pleading with Indians not to submit to it. But one thing I can say with certainty: neither General Smuts nor anybody else will find it possible to imprison or deport 13,000 Indians. This is the general rule: a law can be enforced only where a large majority of people are willing to submit to it. I may point out that a law against stealing cannot work where all men are thieves. For example, men called thugs in certain parts of India, who practise thugging or cheating have not been subdued by any law. If it is thus possible for
 
 criminals to remain at large, what can be done to innocent people like the Indian community?
 POSITION OF MERCHANTS
 Some Indian merchants feel concerned, and many people are doubtful whether or not the former will hold out to the last. This is an occasion when a person who has more wealth will feel more anxious [than others]. The question is: How is one to cast off the yoke of money? Another trouble is that white merchants have discontinued supplying goods [on credit]. To me this is a welcome sign. So long the whites used only to take us lightly and believed that the Indians would not go to gaol. Now they are realizing, that we mean what we say. However, one has to consider what the Indian merchants themselves think in the matter. What if the white merchants stop supplying goods? This is one question. The simple answer to this is only to ask: What shall we do if, even after our submitting to the law, they do not supply goods? No one will ask such a question then. If so, it should not arise even today. It will not be surprising if they do not supply goods and one’s business has to be closed down or curtailed. If any Indian thinks that the law may be repealed, or that there may be some gain to us, without our suffering any hardships for the sake of the community, he will be making a great mistake. We have prepared ourselves to suffer hardships. If we do not bear them willingly, we shall be obliged to suffer humiliation by the law, and to put up with the resulting disgrace. Anyone feeling anxious on this account shows that he has not yet understood the significance of the oath. How can those who are prepared for gaol feel concerned at not being able to get any supply of goods? The right thing for them to do is from this very day to stop buying goods of their own accord, so that they may not feel any difficulty later and may not run short of funds for paying their creditors with. We can win no honour without suffering loss of money, and there can be no relief in future unless we put up with these hardships. As days pass, we shall go through a variety of interesting experiences. We shall receive numerous threats. There will be heavy losses also. One has to die before one can go to paradise.libtech_212_footnoteSimilarly, it will be impossible to get the new law repealed unless we suffer loss of money, and the hardships of imprisonment and even of deportation.
 MUNNIK’S REPRESENTATION
Mr. Munnik made a representation to Mr. Smuts to the effect
 
 
 that a law should be enacted to remove Indian traders to Locations and to limit their trade. Mr. Smuts replied that it was not possible to say what other laws should be made before the effect of the new law was known. But I can give a reply myself. Suppose all Indians leave the Transvaal, with only a few black sheep left behind. If that happens, those who remain will be treated as people unworthy of any respect, and allowed to stay on in some way or other. They will certainly not be permitted to bring other persons to live with them. That is, they will be allowed to live a dog’s life here, and in a few years they will lose their foothold in the ordinary course of things. Now suppose most Indians hold their wealth dear and submit to the law. Then, they will certainly be doomed to the Locations. Who will then be  able  to  oppose a law sending Indians to Locations? If some do so, who will listen to the frail voice of that reed? If many Indians oppose this law, they will doubtless be able to carry on their trade wherever they like and reasonable laws, applicable equally to all merchants—white or Coloured—will be enacted, and the Indian merchants will be able to stay on here with great honour and respect.
 LAW OF DEPORTATION
 The Immigration Bill has been passed by both Houses of Parliament. It is likely to be published in the Gazette on Friday. It will not come into force immediately, as it will be sent to England for approval. We now find in it one article under which the Government will be able to deport forcibly those who may be sentenced under the new law to leave the Transvaal. This is a new clause, and under it the Government will be able to effect forcible deportation of any Indian served with a notice. This is a fresh hardship. One cannot be definite whether this law will or will not be approved in England. If it is approved, however, the provision of deportation will apply to all. But it means nothing. If the Transvaal Government has the courage to imprison Indians, it will as well have the courage to deport them forcibly. Looking at the situation realistically, it can be presumed that the provision will be applied to the leaders only. A petition against the law is being sent to England by the British Indian Association,libtech_213_footnoteand will have been probably despatched even before this letter appears in print.
 FROM RUSTENBURG
 From Rustenburg there is a telegram to say that, by God’s grace, all Indians are firm in their opposition to registration.
 
 LETTER TO “THE STAR”
 Mr. Gandhi has  written  the  following  letterlibtech_214_footnotein  reply  to  The Star’s comment.
 “THE STAR”
 The Star has strongly criticized this letter of Mr. Gandhi asking why, if the giving of finger-prints was not the chief objection, so much emphasis was laid on the question till now. It adds that Mr. Gandhi’s proposal cannot be considered practicable since, if children are not registered, and the police have no authority to make  inquiries wherever they like and take finger-prints, there may be an influx of Indians on a large scale. To this Mr. Gandhi has again sent a rejoinderlibtech_215_footnotelibtech_216_footnoteto say that, though finger-prints are not the chief point, they certainly are one of the objectionable points. Moreover, there can be no compulsion to give finger-prints. In Lord Milner’s time, the Indian community had agreed to give the  thumb-impression voluntarily. Even voluntarily, Indians will not give ten-finger prints. The Star has not read the proposal carefully. But even if every white is against Indians, God is with them and that is enough.
 MEETING OF ASSOCIATION
 A meeting of the Association took place on Wednesday. Those present were Messrs Essop Mia, Abdool Gani, Naidoo, Shahaboodeen, Aswat, Malim Mahomed, Emam Abdool Cadir, Omarji Sale, Gulam Mahomed, M. P. Fancy, Kadodia, Musa Essakji, I. A. Kazi, Ameeroodeen, Vallabhram, Ambaidas and others. Mr. Gandhi read out the petition pertaining to the Immigration Bill, and sought permission to despatch it and to send telegramslibtech_217_footnotelibtech_218_footnotein connection with it. On Mr. Shahaboodeen’s proposal, seconded by Mr. Fancy, permission was given by the meeting. On the proposal of Mr. Mahomed Shahaboodeen, seconded by Mr. Coovadia, Mr. Essop Mia’s appointment as Chairman was confirmed. Mr. Polak was elected Assistant Honorary Secretary on the proposal of Mr. Emam Abdool Cadir, supported by Mr. Naidoo.
 On Mr. Fancy’s proposal, seconded by Mr. Omarji Sale, it was resolved to publish the accounts of the Association every month in Indian Opinion.
 
 LATEST CABLEGRAMS
 The proposal before the House of Commons to grant a loan to the Transvaal has been passed. But, while criticising it, Sir Charles Dilke, Mr. Lyttelton, Mr. Cox and other members spoke at length on the hardships suffered by Indians. Mr. Lyttelton, a former Secretary, said that it was the duty of the Imperial Government to protect the rights of Indians before the loan was sanctioned. The Government had failed in that duty. Mr. Cox suggested that it was necessary for the Imperial Government to recommend to the Dutch Government to pay, out of the loan of £5,000,000, damages to such Indians as might be deported from the Transvaal. These moves show that the Indian cause will receive support in England in proportion to the strength that the Indians display here.

 The Committee of my Association has noticed in the papers the proposal of the General Purposes Committee that the Traffic By-laws may be so amended as to prevent British Indians, among others, from using first-class cabs.

132,,THE IMMIGRATION PETITION,"
  
 The British Indian Association of the Transvaal has lost no time in petitioning Lord Elginlibtech_219_footnoteregarding the Immigrants’ Restriction Bill of the Transvaal, which was gazetted as an Act on the 26th instant, containing the reservation clause that “it shall not take effect unless and until the Governor shall proclaim in the Gazette that it is His Majesty’s pleasure not to disallow the same”. It is of no force until the Royal pleasure becomes known. Lord Elgin, therefore, has now an opportunity of retrieving what we consider was an Imperial blunder in his having advised His Majesty to sanction the Asiatic Registration Act. Mr. Essop Ismail Mia, in the petition, has dealt with every point arising out of the Act. For the present, however, we propose to confine ourselves to the Act as it affects Indians domiciled in the Transvaal.
 We recollect Mr. Duncan having stated emphatically that the Asiatic Registration Act was considered necessary because there was no Immigration Ordinance in force at the time, and that it was to be treated merely as a temporary step. It was also, undoubtedly, panic legislation to stop the so-called inflowing tide of Asiatic immigration at the rate, the Honourable Mr. Curtis told us, of at least 200 per month. It is a curious commentary on Mr. Duncan’s statementlibtech_220_footnotelibtech_221_footnote,  as also [on] Mr. Curtis’, that a year after the introductory speech by the then Colonial Secretary, registration has not yet been effected, and that the Asiatic Registration Act is still practically of no force, except for the fact that registering officers perambulate the Colony in search of Asiatic applicants for the benefits which, Lord Selborne states, the Registration Act confers upon them. And it is this very Act which the measure under consideration makes permanent, and thus, whilst it  frees the white inhabitants of the Transvaal from the Peace  Preservation Ordinance, it draws the noose tighter round the necks of Asiatics.
 Asiatics, then, find that a grant of greater liberty to white British subjects corresponds with a greater restraint on that of Asiatic British subjects. Unlike other and older self-governing Colonies, this new pet child of the Empire is to be allowed to set aside rights of British Indians who are already domiciled in the Transvaal, by reason of their having paid £3 to the old Dutch Government, for, under the Immigration Act, as the British Indian Association points out, only those Asiatics who are registered in the terms of the Asiatic Act are
 
 allowed to retain their domicile.
 The last point dealt with by the Association outdoes the other two mentioned by us in severity. It provides for the physical deportation of those British Indians who fail to take out registration certificates under the new Act. Now the taking out of the certificate is, after all, a formality invested with many incidents of slavery. It is not as if the people who fail to take out registration certificates are not residents of the Transvaal. Indeed, most of the Indians, who are making a brave stand against the Asiatic Act, are old respectable inhabitants of that Colony, some of them, like the Chairman himself, of 20 years’ standing, having all their earthly possessions in that Colony, having there even their families, places of worship and everything they hold dear in the world. It is these men who, because they decline to take out a degrading document, are to be forcibly turned out from their home; and this deportation is to take place at the expense of the deported, and it is to create no obligation on the part of the Transvaal Government even to feed and house them! Well may Mr. Mia declare that this deportation will be much worse than deportation for heinous offences.
 We shall be painfully astonished if Lord Elgin, with his declared sympathies and with his past Viceregal career before him, advises His Majesty to sanction a measure of this description. He has more than once stated that he does not like the Asiatic Act. He has now thrown into his hands a golden opportunity of treating with the Transvaal Government, with a view to having the Asiatic Act repealed, and the principle of re-registration being embodied in a modified form in the Immigration Act.

133,,CAPE INDIANSlibtech_222_footnote,"
  
 The Cape Town British Indian League is to be congratulated on submitting a well-reasoned representation to the Cape Parliament, in connection with the working of the Immigration Act and the Dealers’ Licences Act of that Colony. The points raised in the memorial have been raised none too soon, and, as the memorialists rightly point out, their prayer has been considered by many prominent Cape politicians as reasonable and just. It is, for instance, impossible to justify the practice of issuing temporary permits to British Indians who have occasion to leave the Peninsula, failure to return within the period fixed in the letter of permission costing them their domicile. This
 
 makes them ticket-of-leave men, and puts an utterly unjustifiable and undue restraint on their personal liberty. Nor can the practice of depriving old Indian hawkers of their licences, without cause, be justified in any way. We trust that the memorial presented by the British Indians will receive the earnest consideration of the Cape Government.

134,,THE LADYSMITH TRADERSlibtech_223_footnote,"
  
 Ladysmith Chamber of Commerce is again on the track of British Indians who have been unjustly deprived by the Ladysmith Board of their licences to trade in the Klip River District, and who have the temerity to continue to earn their livelihood by plying their trade without licences. When we say it is the Ladysmith Chamber of Commerce which is after these poor Indians, it simply means that the European merchants who are jealous of their rivals are endeavouring to hound the latter out of the district. There seems to have been some sort of an understanding on the part of the Government that they would mark their disapproval of the conduct of the Ladysmith Board by refusing to sanction the prosecution of innocent men, but it is quite evident that the Chamber has coerced the Government into action, for it appears that the Attorney-General has authorised the Crown Prosecutor to institute proceedings against these men, should they still continue to trade without licences. Such is the working of the Dealers’ Licences Act of Natal, from which the Imperial Government has avowed itself practically powerless to grant relief. The Indian Government, which certainly is all-powerful, refuses to make use of the only and effective remedy at its disposal, namely, to stop  indentured Indian immigration, if the free Indian population of Natal is denied bare justice.

135,,DADABHAI’S BIRTHDAY,"
  
 The birthday of Dadabhai Naoroji, the Grand Old Man of India, falls on September 4. He is nearing the end of his days on the earth. As time passes, the light of the Grand Old Man is growing brighter. London to him is a wilderness. He has taken residence in this wilderness like a hermit for the sake of his country. Those who have
 
 seen his office in England know that it does not in any way differ from a hermitage. Hardly two people can sit in it. Sitting there, he shoulders the burden of the sufferings of the vast millions of India. Though he has reached an advanced age, he is capable of harder work than an Indian youth. We wish him a long life, and pray to the Creator to give us, and to all those connected with this journal, a heart as pure as his. We advise our readers to emulate his patriotism, that being the only right way to cherish the name of this [Grand] Old Man who is a grandfather indeed. The Indians of the Transvaal should bear in mind that they have to be faithful to their resolve as the immortal Dadabhai has been to his for our sake. We believe all associations of Indians will hold meetings on that day and send telegrams of congratulations. It is our intention to give a photograph of the [Grand] Old Man on every birthday of his. Accordingly, we shall publish next week, that is, at the earliest opportunity after the birthday, a photograph of his which, we recommend, should be got framed and preserved by everyone.

 "
136,,NEED FOR GREAT CAUTION,"
  
 All eyes are at present turned on the Transvaal Indians. Just at such a time, we have received news of some weakness in the Indian community. At the present juncture whatever is unhealthy in the community is to be exposed; it cannot be suppressed. It will be, we think, an act of treason to suppress it.
 The Indian community comprises mainly Surti, Memon and Konkani Muslims, Parsis and Hindus. We hear that a large proportion of Memons and Konkanis have become impatient with the struggle against the law. It is said that they are now prepared to yield, but, before yielding, desire the Government to make some changes. We have seen the draft petition seeking the amendments. We feel humiliated even to print it. The draft, in our judgment, is a document inviting slavery for ourselves. The concessions desired therein are no concessions. The language in which the request is made is so cringing that it can only mean that most of the leaders of the Indian community were never opposed to the new law. The giving of finger-prints is accepted. No objection is taken to the humiliation of Turkish Muslims. The only demand is for the appointment of special
 officers to inspect the permits of respectable Indians and for obtaining their finger-prints in private. Moreover, if the holders of old licences are able to give their signatures, the Licensing Officer should not demand finger-prints. The temporary permits should continue to be issued as at present, and children’s finger-prints taken after they have attained the age of 16.
 Among these demands there is not one to concede which any change in the Regulations may be necessary, let alone the law. “Very well,” can be General Smuts’ reply to such a letter. In that case, those who feel pleased with the letter may immediately take out  the title-deed of slavery, i.e., the register. The draft moreover states that Indians are wax in the hands of law. We hold that such a statement does not lie well in the mouth of anyone who believes in the existence of God. For man is like wax in the hands of God alone.
 We are glad to say that the letter referred to above has not been despatched to General Smuts. Nor do we mean to say that the letter was approved by Memons, Konkanis or any others. Our only reason for making this matter public is that, though this blow was warded off in time, there can be no certainty that such an attempt will not be repeated. A frightened man will clutch at anything. Is there anyone who will not try to get hold of the dry stumps while rolling down the slope of a hill? Some Indians in the Transvaal are in a similar plight. We would advise such Indians to submit to the law immediately and take out registers instead of meddling with the question of the law. That will not lay them open to much blame. But, if they have such letters written which tarnish the fair name of the community, they will be regarded to have done, and will have actually done, very much more harm than what Mr. Haji Ebrahim and Mr. Khamisa have done. Mr. Haji Ebrahim and his comrades put themselves to shame out of fear, being unable to keep up courage. But those addressing letters such as the above will drag down the community while they blacken their own faces. They will have proved that the struggle of the Indians was not against the law as such, but only for slight changes in it. The draft petition referred to above also states that, barring some men intent on mischief, Indians are eager to get themselves registered. How amusing this is !
 Moreover, if such a  petition  is  sent  to  General  Smuts  on behalf of the Indians, the petition that has been submitted concerning the Immigration Bill will also receive a set-back. The fight that is
 
 being put up by the South Africa British Indian Committee will have been in vain, and the Indian community will have been robbed in broad daylight. It is our particular request, therefore, that any individual or group that desires to take out the register is free to do so. Only, they should not drag others along with them. Why should all Memons or all Konkanis or all Hindus have their faces besmirched just because some Memons, or some Konkanis, or some Hindus or Surtis or Parsis do so? Is there among the Memons no brave man who will  courageously  declare: “Even  if other Memons should go,  I certainly will not.” Why can a Konkani not speak out to the same effect? Why will Indians follow  the  example of others in doing evil?  If,  like  sheep,  we  are   still  ready  to  follow  one  another  into a ditch, it should be taken for certain that we shall be doomed to have the obnoxious law with us for ever.

137,,LICENCES IN LADYSMITH,"
  
 Clouds are gathering again over those Indians in Ladysmith who have not received licences. They carry on trade without a licence. The Chamber of Commerce has therefore recommended that they should be prosecuted. Mr. Labistour has replied that if they continue to do so, action will be taken against them. An assurance was given to the leaders of the Congress that those who traded without a licence would not be harassed. This promise was given out of a sense of justice. Now that the Europeans are bringing pressure, this sense of justice has collapsed and the Government, submitting to the pressure, wants the shops to be closed down. This gives the clearest picture of the shape of things to come in the nature of hardships for Indians. There are three ways to scatter these clouds:
 To 	prefer an 	appeal to 	the Privy Council.  If 	such an 	appeal is 	not to 	be filed, the 	President of the 	Congress should 	meet the Imperial 	Government. This step 	can be taken 	along with the first.  To 	have courage 	and keep 	the shops 	open. In 	case of prosecution, 	not to 	pay the fine, 	but allow 	the goods 	to be 	auctioned. 
 The first way can be adopted only when the Congress has a fund of £1,000. The second step must be taken in any case. It will not solve the difficulties for ever. The third way is the easiest of all and the best.
 But it is a way that the brave alone can take. It does not depend on anybody’s advice. One must have courage oneself. If this is there, everything can be done. There is no provision in this Act for  a sentence of imprisonment. Only a fine can be imposed. If the fine is not paid, it can be collected by auction of goods. We urge Indians to adopt that way. Men like Dr. Rutherford have adopted it, and we, too, can do likewise. But in such matters, prompting by others is of no avail. The necessary urge has to come from within.

138,,"WHY WAS “ THE LIFE OF
	PROPHET MAHOMED” DISCONTINUED?","
  
 We feel sad in answering this question. In utter good faith and out of great regard [for Islam], we started publishing a translation [of Irving’s book], with a view to serving the Indian community and, in particular, the Muslim brethren. Among the biographies written by white men, Washington Irving’s work is regarded as excellent. On the whole, he has shown the wonderful greatness of the Prophet, and has presented the good teachings of Islam in shining colours. Whether this is so or not, we believe it is the duty of every Muslim to know what the whites write about Islam and its Founder. In translating the book, our object was to help them perform this duty. While the translation was being given, some of our readers were pained to read the account of the Prophet’s marriage in chapter V, and suggested that we should stop publishing the life. Our aim is to show as far as possible that this journal belongs to the whole of the Indian community. We have no desire to injure needlessly the feelings of anyone in any way. Therefore we have stopped publishing the “Life”libtech_224_footnotelibtech_225_footnoteand feel sorry that
 
 
 we had to do so. For, we took great pains over the translation, and our readers will not have the opportunity of appreciating the excellent work of Irving. Moreover, we hear that many persons are displeased that we have discontinued the “Life”. To them we have only to say that those who want the translation of the biography may write to us. If many readers express the desire, we shall try to meet the wishes of such devout men by bringing it out separately in book-form when convenient to the Press.

140,,WHAT IS BRAVERY?,"
  
 There is a report in the Press that the Moors (who are Muslims) have shown excellent bravery in Casablanca.
 Shouting their war cries, the Moorish spearmen made a gallop-charge on the French gunmen. They paid no heed to the shower of bullets and shell-splinters raining on them. Many fell wounded. Those who survived advanced to the very mouths of the cannon before they returned.
 The reader may ask how one can return from the mouths of cannons. But that is the wonderful thing about bravery.
 So great was their fervour that the French gunners did not have the heart to fire on such brave warriors. They greeted these brave ones with cries of “Hurrah!” and clapped their hands in admiration. These brave warriors then saluted them and turned back.
 Such brave people may be emulated by the whole world. All can sing their praises. Our Muslim readers specially have to take a lesson from them. Without doubt the Transvaal Indians will win if there is in them a hundredth part of the bravery of these Moors who are regarded as uncivilized. Here no one has to die. No one has to kill. Only money is to be sacrificed.

141,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
  
 
 NYLSTROOM AND RUSTENBURG
 
 From both these localities the Permit Office returned, as it had gone, empty-handed! The Nylstroom Indians even closed their shops for a day. No person got himself registered. Telegrams of congrat- ulation were despatched to both places by the British Indian Association and the Hamidia Islamic Society. All this is very good. But we should not get elated at this. The boycott of the Permit Office has become an easy thing. There is not much risk involved in the boycott as people are allowed to register themselves at any place. But it remains to be seen whether they will not rush about in panic when the last place is named and the last date fixed. Already, doubts are being raised whether people will maintain their courage then, and, if they do, whether it will last when the time comes to go to gaol.
 RAILWAY HARDSHIPS
 
 Mr. Abdool Gani and Mr. Goolam Mahomed were not allowed to board the 4.40 evening train at Johannesburg when they wished to go to Pretoria. The correspondence carried on by the Association on that question has come to a close. The Chief Traffic Manager has expressed regret, but says that there was no room even in the guard’s carriage and that is why they were not allowed to travel. General Smuts says that all these hardships are for the good of Indians. This fight cannot be carried further at present. For the Indian community is now on the anvil. If it turns out to be real gold as a result of hammering, the hardships in regard to railways, etc., will automatically disappear. If it is proved to be base metal, what does it matter whether
 one is entitled to a railway ticket or not?
 SEND-OFF TO ALLY
 On Saturday, Mr. Haji Ojer Ally left for the  Cape  with  his family. He was seen off by Messrs Abdool Gani,  Shahaboodeen Hasan, Ameeroodeen, Goolam Mahomed, Mahomed Shahaboodeen, Chapman, Polak, Gandhi and others. There were tears in the eyes of Mr. and Mrs. Ally. Mr. Ally’s words of farewell deserve to be remembered. He said, “Leave aside the question whether I have erred or not. For, to err is human. But it will be enough if other Indians do as much as I am doing.” Truly, these words are memorable. He has left the Transvaal rather than submit to the law; this is a step on which, condoning his mistake, we should congratulate him. We shall succeed in the end if many Indians stand up to do even as much.
 SENTENCED FOR INSOLVENCY FRAUD
 Ismail Isa, an insolvent debtor, was accused of fraud. His case was heard by Mr. De Villiers at Pretoria. The charge against him was that, though he knew that he was about to be declared insolvent, he had purchased tobacco from Ernest Ebbert & Co. Being found guilty, he was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. This is a case which will bring shame to the Indian community. There must not be a single case of insolvency among us. We ought to have that much sense of honour. But here we find fraud along with insolvency. Indians  certainly ought to keep away from such acts.
 LETTER FROM RUSTENBURG
 A letter has been received by the Association from Rustenburg about the success achieved by the community there. It says that Captain Chamney there approached Indians with a view to persuading them. But everyone gave a firm reply that he would not take out the register. Mr. Chamney also approached them and returned with the same reply. Messrs Bapu Desai, Rahimbhoy, Vakharia, Madhi and M.
 E. Kazi enlisted themselves as volunteers. The shops remained closed for half a day. Mr. Cody approached Mr. de Souza, a Portuguese Indian, who also flatly refused to be registered.
 LETTERS FROM VOLKSRUST AND WAKKERSTROOM
 There are letters from Volksrust and Wakkerstroom in which the leaders state that not a single Indian will take out the permit. All are quite determined.
 ANOTHER HUMILIATION
There is a move in the Johannesburg Municipality to prevent the
 Indians, the Chinese and other black people from riding in first-class horse-carriages. The Association has sent a letter objecting to the proposal.libtech_226_footnoteBut there is little probability of its carrying any weight at present.

  September 	4, 1907  	The struggle which we have launched is a momentous one, and so its 	results will be equally important. If we succeed,  the condition of 	Indians will improve to a large extent, in the Transvaal certainly, 	but also in Natal, the Cape, and even in India. If we retreat, 	however, the result will be equally disastrous. In Natal, one Mr. 	Haggar      Gandhiji’s 	visit to Durban. Requested by the chairman, Dawad Mahomed, Gandhiji 	explained the latest position regarding the Transvaal struggle. 	These are extracts from a report of the meeting.   
 has raised a question in the Parliament about introducing there an Act similar to the Transvaal Registration Act; in the Cape licensed hawkers and shopkeepers have to put up with hardships; new laws are being passed and new restrictions imposed in Delagoa Bay; even in Rhodesia special legislation is being enacted against Indians, and in German [East] Africa, too, proposals humiliating to Indians are being can- vassed. All these things can stop if we show our mettle. Whatever needs to be done in the Transvaal at the present moment is already being done. The Committee in London is also working with utmost energy. Natal, too, has rendered some help. The telegrams sent to Pretoria on July 31 and those despatched from time to time to the various associations and merchants in other places have had a very good effect. The Transvaal Indians and I are thankful to you for this.  I am also aware that a sum of £100 has been sent from here to the Committee in England. That is in the fitness of things. But apart from this, Natal has still much to do. More money can be collected here. I do not suggest that you should make the collections in the places mentioned earlier and send them to the Transvaal; the funds collected locally may be kept on hand here, so that they can be drawn upon in case of need. The people in the Transvaal are also collecting a fund and contributing their due share. The British Indian Association has already spent about £1,500 in this struggle, but there is need for more expenditure yet. They have at present only a balance of £100. I am often asked the question: Being so poor, how will the Association be able to support the families of those who will go to gaol? Some other questions, too, are asked. To all such questions I have but one reply: Since we have faith in God, how can we ask what will happen to the members of our family? Still, we should do our duty in the matter. We should move from house to house in every village to collect contribu- tions. We should acquaint the people with the present situation, so that they may willingly contribute and also realize to what plight the new law seeks to reduce us. That is, we must do all we can. Then can we place our entire trust in God. We are doing all that is needed. At the same time, we have also to pray to God with all our heart, and beg of Him: “Oh God! if our grievances are not heard in this world, we have at least full confidence in You, that in Your court no injustice will be tolerated.” At the Hamidia Society [meeting] last Sunday, Moulvi Ahmed Mukhtiar, too, gave the same advice, namely, that we had to send our deputation now only to the court of God. The same opinion was also expressed at Germiston last Sunday during the festival of
 Lord Krishna’s birth anniversary. All of us can pray likewise.
 In reply to a question, Mr. Gandhi said:
 With regard to the opportunity that has offered itself to us in Ladysmith, three alternatives were suggested in the last issue of Indian Opinion.libtech_233_footnotelibtech_234_footnoteAny one of these should   be  followed.  The  present  case differs from the one in which we had appealed to the Privy Council. In the present case, we can proceed against the Board. If the case is decided against us, we can then appeal to the Privy Council. But that will need a lot of money. I think it is better that the shops be kept boldly open. This fight, once started, should be kept up to the last. The shopkeepers should not pay fines, but allow their goods to be auctioned again and again. Other merchants who have been granted licences for the current year should write to the Government that, in view of the injustice that was being done  to  their  brother-traders,  they too would keep their shops openwithout licences next year. If in this manner we make a heavy sacrifice of money with courage and determination, we are bound to win. The money we have already earned or that we may earn in future will have value only if we win, otherwise we shall lead a dog’s life here.
 The taking of thumb-impressions in the Immigration Office at the Point is against the law. The Act certainly does not empower the Immigration Office to demand thumb-impressions. If we fight with patience and firmness, the taking of thumb-impressions will stop. It is necessary that this practice which has been newly started should be nipped in the bud.
 Asked about some people in the Transvaal wanting to come to a compromise and get themselves registered, Mr. Gandhi said:
 Some Memons in Pretoria wish to come to an understanding with the Government and register themselves. This compromise is not at all advantageous, but is on the contrary harmful to us. Those who have understood the real nature of our struggle will not be satisfied with such a compromise. The draft agreement sent by the Association is the only right one. It will be better for those who are satisfied with a nominal compromise to take out registers just now. That will not cripple the struggle of the community.
 Giving an explanation about the news item that had appeared in that day’s papers about Lord Elgin having refused to give assent to the Municipal Franchise Act, Mr. Gandhi said:
 
 The credit for this success goes to the Committee in London. The Act had been forwarded to the Imperial Government for Royal assent a long time ago, and it had remained under consideration all this time. Hence, there was a possibility that the Act would be rejected. However, if the Committee had not protested and exerted itself as it did to oppose it, the result we see today would not probably have come about. I hope that everyone will avail himself of the right of franchise that we now possess.
 Explaining the position about the reported intention of the Estcourt Board to seek permission to appeal to the Privy Council against the decision of the Supreme Court in Mr. Haffejee’s case, Mr. Gandhi said:
 It is not probable that the Board will seek permission to appeal. For, that will involve a lot of expenditure and there will be no gain. However, we should not oppose their effort to seek permission to appeal to the Privy Council.
 After these clarifications, Mr. Gandhi informed the meeting about the cablegramlibtech_235_footnotethat had been dispatched in the morning in connection with the birthday  of Dadabhai Naoroji that was being celebrated that day.
 On this occasion, the Indians of Tongaat had sent a telegram wishing long life to the Grand Old Man. Thereafter, everyone stood up and, wishing long life to Dadabhai, called for three cheers. The meeting came to an end at 10 p.m.

147,,ON THE DUTY OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCElibtech_236_footnote,"
  
 It would seem as if the action of both Houses of Parliament in passing the Bill to legalise the marriage with a deceased wife’s sister will convert the clergy of the Established Church into passive resisters of sorts. The Archbishop of Canterbury today issued a message in which he requested the clergy not to celebrate marriages with a deceased wife’s sister although such unions are now recognised as legal by the law of the land.
 The  Daily Press
 We have no desire to enter into the controversy as to whether marriage with a deceased wife’s sister is a reform in the right direction or not. We have quoted the above mentioned cablegram in order to show that passive resistance is one of the most approved methods of securing redress in given circumstances, and that it is the only course law-abiding and peaceful men can adopt without doing violence to their conscience. Indeed, it would appear that it is a method they must adopt if they. have a conscience, and it revolts against particular legislation. It may be retorted that, between the passive resistance offered by British Indians in the Transvaal and that advised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, there is no resemblance. We demur and claim that, if it is lawful for the Archbishop of Canterbury to disregard the deceased wife’s sister relief legislation, it is much more so for British Indians to withhold submission to the Asiatic Registration Act. If there is no penalty provided by law to punish the clergy who may
 
 not recognise it, by refusing to perform a marriage  ceremony,  it should be doubly their duty to accept the law. But the Archbishop, in deliberately giving contrary advice, has brought into play a higher law, and that is the law dictated by conscience. Rightly or wrongly, His Grace believes that there is no warrant for such unions in the Bible and that, therefore, the Legislature has committed a breach of God’s law, which it would be irreligious for the clergy to countenance. In other words, he has recognised what Thoreau has said, that we should be men before we are subjects, and that there is no obligation imposed upon us by our conscience to give blind submission to any law, no matter what force or majority backs it.
 Such is also the position of British Indians in the Transvaal. Law abiding they are, and it will take away nothing from the certificate they have enjoyed so long by their now refusing to accept registration underthe Asiatic Law, which their conscience rejects as degrading to their manhood and offensive to their religion. It is possible to carry the doctrine of passive resistance too far, but it is equally so with reference to the doctrine of obedience to law. We cannot give the dividing line in words more appropriate than those of Thoreau when, speaking of the American Government, he says:
 If one were to tell me that this was a bad Government because it taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports, it is most probable that I should not make any ado about it, for I can do without them. All machines have friction, and possibly this does enough good to counterbalance the evil. At any rate, it is a great evil to make a stir about it. But, when the friction comes to have its machine, and oppression and robbery are paramount, I say let us not have any such machine any longer.
 In the Asiatic Registration Act, British Indians have not only a law which has some evil in it, that is to say, using Thoreau’s words, a machine with friction in it, but it is evil legalised, or it represents friction with machinery provided for it. Resistance to such an evil is a divine duty which no human being can with impunity disregard, and, as in the case of the Archbishop of Canterbury, so in that of British Indians, it is their conscience that must decide, as it has  already decided, whether to submit to the Asiatic Act or not, cost what it may.

148,,SUPPLEMENT TO “INDIAN OPINION”,"
  
 We said in our last issue that we would give in this issue a photograph of the Hon’ble Dadabhai Naoroji in honour of his birthday. The reader will accordingly find the photograph in this
 
 issue. It was taken when India’s Grand Old Man visited India last year, and was published in India. We appeal to all our readers to have the photograph framed. But the true framing of it, in our opinion, would only be to engrave it in our hearts. To adorn and preserve a piece of paper without giving the least thought to what it stands for—this is, it may be said, exactly what idolatry means. The only purpose of  keeping the photograph in our room is that, by seeing it, we should call to mind our duty afresh every day. Our present condition  in South Africa as well as in India is such that, even if hundreds of heroes like Dadabhai came forward, they would be far too few. And unless such men do come forward, there will be no improvement in our political condition or in other affairs of worldly life.

149,,WELCOME,"
  
 The new Governor of Natal, Sir Mathew Nathan, has already arrived. His Excellency is 45 years of age, and is unmarried. His Excellency is a Jew, the first member of the race to be appointed Governor in South Africa. It is said that His Excellency is a very kind and hard-working person, with wide experience. At Hong Kong, he won the hearts of all communities. Natal is in a bad plight today. At this juncture, though he cannot interfere actively in a self-governing Colony, he can certainly help much by his advice as a gentleman and by his personal example. We hope that the expectations that have been raised about him will be fulfilled. His Excellency is accompanied by his sister, Miss Nathan. She attends to his social engagements and takes the place of hostess at social functions.

150,,BENEFITS OF PASSIVE RESISTANCE,"
  
 NOTABLE INSTANCE
 Nowadays the people of Ireland are striving hard for their rights. Some Irish leaders are convinced that the people of Ireland suffer because they live in a particular country, just as Indians suffer because of the colour of their skin. In other words, the Indian people suffer many hardships both in India and outside and are treated as
 inferior to Englishmen. The Irish people count for nothing in their own land and are oppressed by their English rulers. But no sooner do they go out of Ireland than they enjoy rights quite similar to those of Englishmen. There are about 86 members in the House of Commons representing Ireland. But the British Members of the House, blinded by their self-interest, do all they can to prevent the Irish from succeeding in their efforts. For this reason, some Irish leaders now wish to adopt a different line of action to have their grievances redressed.   That   movement   is   called   Sinn   Feinlibtech_237_footnotelibtech_238_footnote,   which,   literally translated into Gujarati, means exactly our Swadeshi movement. Day by day, the Sinn Fein party is growing stronger. In their struggle, passive resistance is one of the main weapons. Till now, Irishmen favoured violent action. While theIrish people are tenants,  the landlords are British who are foreigners there. As a remedy, the tenants often resorted to violence against their foreign landlords. Now it has been decided to educate the people for gradually withdrawing the Irish Members from the British Parliament, refraining from taking disputes between Irish parties to the law courts established in Ireland, and boycotting British goods even at the cost of hardship to themselves. Through such measures they would raise the resounding cry of Swadeshi or Sinn Fein, so that without any violent struggle taking place the British would ultimately be obliged, or might agree, to grant Home Rule to Ireland, or would quit Ireland, and the Irish people would have an absolutely independent government.
 This movement had its roots in Austria-Hungary in the south of Europe. Austria and Hungary were two separate countries. But Hungary was under the rule of Austria and was always exploited by it. To discomfit Austria, a Hungarian named Dick taught the people that they should not pay any taxes to Austria, should not serve any Austrian officers, and even forget the very name of Austria. Though the Hungarians were very weak, this kind of spirit enabled them in the end to assert themselves against Austria. Now Hungary is not regarded as subject to Austria, but claims parity with it.
 These instances deserve to be emulated by  the  Transvaal Indians. They clearly prove that what is known to have happened earlier in history must also happen in the case of Indians in the
 
 Transvaal. That is to say, none can imprison thousands of men or deport them. But every Indian ought to be prepared to be imprisoned or deported; and to prove that Indians are so ready, some of them shall indeed have to suffer imprisonment, even  deportation.  The Indian who may be called upon to suffer deportation or imprisonment will be said to have truly lived and won the battle of life. His name will be immortal, and he will have fully met the claim of the motherland on him.

151,,PRIME MINISTER’S VIEWS,"
  
 Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has replied to Mr. Ritch that he will not receive the deputation of the South Africa British Indian Committee. Reuter has cabled a summary of his reply. According to the cable, the Prime Minister has stated that he has already written to the Transvaal Government to say that the new law is bad. But the Transvaal now enjoys self-government, and hence he cannot interfere in the implementation of the Act, nor is he in a position to exert much pressure on the Transvaal just now. Sir Henry seems to have taken nearly twenty days to send such a reply. We infer from this that the Imperial Government has received information from the  Transvaal that the Indian community will, in the end, accept registration without the use of force. We think General Smuts has been encouraged to say this by the fact that some persons have taken out registration certificates and others are about to do so. If our inference is correct, there is no cause for disappointment at Sir Henry’s reply. The time for Sir Henry to intervene will come when the real struggle begins, and Indians, even when sent to gaol or deported, remain firm and do not submit to the law. If even at that time he does not intervene, we shall believe that the sun of the British Empire is about to set. For, if the Imperial Government does not protect innocent people when they are being oppressed, commonsense tells us that God will deprive it of its power. How can he be called a king who does not protect?
 But the struggle of the Indians has little to do with whether Sir Henry intervenes or not. The struggle this time is a test of our own strength. We shall not submit to the law which we condemn at present, only because we find the Imperial Government weak. If the Imperial Government merely looks on with folded hands while we are being
 ruined, Indians will have to depend on their own strength to stay on in the Colonies. And if they are averse to face imprisonment, etc., they will be ruined in the Colonies and meet a miserable end, for we believe that living a dog’s life is worse than death.
 Commenting on Sir Henry’s letter, an influential British journal called the Pall Mall Gazette has stated that Sir Henry has displayed cowardice and baseness in allowing the rights of Indians to be abrogated, and that the Home Government will have to pay for this cowardice. A cable to this effect is published in The Sunday Times of Johannesburg. We can assume from this that the struggle in England is not over.

152,,NATAL MUNICIPAL FRANCHISE ACT,"
  
 There has been a long argument whether Indians  in  Natal  should have the municipal franchise or not. But so far it was impossible to determine what the result would be. Now we find from Press reports that Lord Elgin has disapproved the Bill. The reason given is that in the matter of licences the Natal Government has failed to satisfy the Imperial Government. There is no doubt that this is the result of the existence of the South Africa British Indian Committee and the vigorous fight put upby it. Our readers will recall that on numerous occasions Mr. Ritchwrote to Lord Elgin in connection with the Bill on behalf of the Committee. But we need not be particularly elated by this success. We ourselves do not attach much weight to municipal rights. They sometimes prove to be burdensome, unless one has the knowledge and the strength to use them. Though in the eyes of the law the white skin and the brown skin may have equal rights, we can see that in America at present they alone will make a mark who have more energy, are better educated, and are more intelligent and public-spirited. It is the same in the Cape Colony.  Here  Indians,  Kaffirs and whites, all the three have equal rights of vote; yet the Indian community has been steadily losing ground. The weapon of franchise has been rusting, and such laws about trade licences as suit the whim of white merchants are being enacted. In our view, the first lesson of this is that the Indian, whether poor or rich, ought to have in him a spirited sense of his manhood. He must make himself strong enough to fight or make sacrifices in other ways for the rights of the community. The part the Transvaal Indians play will show whether this is the time when we shall acquire these qualities or whether we shall have to wait for them for many years yet.

 Dr. Nundylibtech_239_footnotelibtech_240_footnotehas  published  a  pamphlet  on  the  new  law.  It  is priced 1s. He has made in it a slanderous attack on Lord Selborne, Mr. Curtis, Mr. Chamney, Mr. Cody and others, and made similar comments on Mr. Gandhi, too. I do not think it  necessary  to reproduce here the substance of all those comments. He has made a suggestion in the pamphlet that the new law should be repealed and a Commission appointed to ascertain the rights of Indians,  and  afterwards new registers should be issued to them. There is no difference between this suggestion and the offer of voluntary registration. To that extent Dr. Nundy’s pamphlet can prove helpful to us. But whether the pamphlet means that the law might remain in force and only the registers should be modified is not made clear. However, it does not appear to us likely that any weight will  be attached to this pamphlet since we see nothing in it which is new. I also do not think that Mr. Chamney and Mr. Cody will suffer any harm on account of the attacks made on them. Dr. Nundy admits in the pamphlet that the gaol resolution is the only thing that will benefit the Indian community. He has relied on the Rand Daily Mail in asserting that a suggestion was made to exempteducated people from giving finger-prints. But such a suggestion had never been made. And even if it were made, the struggle against the law would not come to an end. Apart from this, we find other [suggestions]libtech_241_footnotelibtech_242_footnotetoo.

154,,. DUTY OF DISOBEYING LAWSlibtech_243_footnotelibtech_244_footnote[1],"
  
 Many years ago, there lived in America a great man named Henry David Thoreau. His writings are read and pondered over by millions of people. Some of them put his ideas into practice. Much importance is attached to his writings because Thoreau himself was a man who practised what he preached. Impelled by a sense of duty, he
 
 wrote much against his own country, America. He considered it a  great sin that the Americans held many persons in the bonds  of slavery. He did not rest content with saying this, but took all other necessary steps to put a stop to this trade. One of those steps consisted in not paying any taxes to the State in which the slave trade was being carried on. He was imprisoned when he stopped paying the taxes due from him. The thoughts which occurred to him during this imprisonment were boldly original and were published in the form of a book. The title of this article conveys the general sense of the English title of his book. Historians say that the chief cause of the abolition of slavery in America was Thoreau’s imprisonment and the publication by him of the above mentioned book after his release. Both his example and writings are at present exactly applicable to the Indians in the Transvaal. We, therefore, give below a summary of these [writings]:
 I accept that that government is best which governs least. That is, government is a kind of disease and the greater the freedom  the people enjoy from it, the more admirable is the government.
 Many persons say that it would be good if America had no [standing] army or had only a small one. What they say is quite right [as far as it goes], but those who hold such a view base it on a false premise. They say that the State is beneficial; it is only the army that is harmful. These eminent men do not realize that an army is but the arm of the Stateand without it the State cannot exist for a moment. But wecannot see this because we are ourselves intoxicated with the power of the State. Really speaking, it is we, the subjects, who are responsible for the existence of both the State and the army.
 Thus we see that we are deceiving ourselves. It is not the government of America that keeps the people free, or educates them. The [achievements of] government that we observe are, in some small measure, the result of the inherent character of the American people. In other words, though we are educated and intelligent, we are somewhat less so than we could have been if it were not for the government.
 But, I do not ask for no government at once, but at once for a better government. This is the duty of every citizen. It is a great error to believe that nothing but justice prevails in a country in which everything is decided by a majority vote. Much injustice continues to be perpetrated because this error is not recognized. It is a mere superstition to believe that what is done by a multitude is bound to be right. Can there not be a government in which majorities do  not  decide right and wrong, but conscience? Must the citizen always
 resign his conscience to the legislators? I would say that we are men first and subjects afterwards. It is not necessary to cultivate a respect for the law so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right. Law never made man a whit more just. But I have seen and I do see that even ordinarily well-disposed persons become, through their simplicity, the instruments of injustice. One result of an undue respect for law is that we may see people taking to soldiering and, like monkeys, mechanically carrying out the orders of their superiors unquestioningly. Many people thus take to it [soldiering] as their profession. They have no doubt that it is a damnable business in which they are concerned; yet they rush to join it. Are they men, or axes in the hands of butchers ? Such men are on a level with wood and earth and stones. How can that kind of men command any  respect? How can they be valued better than dogs or cats? Then some others become advocates, ambassadors or lawyers. They imagine that they serve the State with their heads. But I find that, unintentionally and unconsciously, they also serve Satan. Those who obey their sense of justice while holding the reins of government are always found to be in conflict with the State.

155,,DANGER OF FINGER-PRINTS AT DURBAN,"
  
 For some days past, people have been talking about the Immigration Officer taking thumb-impressions of witnesses when a domicile certificate is issued to an Indian going home via Durban. Some people even say that the Congress should put up a fight in this matter. There is no law yet for such thumb-impressions to be taken, but we believe that this procedure is the first step in the making of such a law. In such matters, the individuals themselves have to do much more than any help that the Congress can give. The Congress can do nothing about men who, for serving their personal ends, give the thumb-impressions when demanded. What evidence is to be considered sufficient for the purpose of issuing a domicile certificate is left to be determined by the Immigration Officer. The Officer can, without asking for the fingerprints, refuse to issue the certificate; and when a man goes begging for such a certificate with entreaties, the Officer may exploit the man’s need and make him give the thumb-impression. We are not suggesting that this method is either proper or just. Nor do we deny that it may be possible to fight this
 legally under certain conditions. Though in putting up such a fight we may ultimately win our point, it is also probable that we may lose. Such hardships are bound to continue so long as some Indians make false affidavits and want to obtain domicile certificates by improper means. But we see no need at present to draw attention to this. We are certain that if we win the Transvaal fight, that is, if the Indian community adheres to its pledge, suffering hardships of all kinds, rather than submit to the obnoxious law, the tree of aggression against our community that has been planted in the Transvaal will not be allowed to grow. And then, we believe, no other Colony will be able to enact a law of this kind. The Imperial Government is at present faced with an impossible situation.libtech_245_footnoteIf, therefore, we fight to the last in the Transvaal, Lord Elgin will never think again of advising the King-Emperor to give assent to such a law.

156,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
  
 The plague of the Permit Office went to a certain village, but disappeared without being able to infect a single person. Not even an Indian prisoner got the infection. The anti-plague squad of physicians—the volunteers—was ready, but wherever the people had a strong physique, the physicians were not needed.
 Such a report has now become a common thing. Hence I do not write at length to give congratulations to Standerton, Heidelberg and Volksrust. We have now got used to this plague. The remedy for it has also been discovered. The same remedy is being supplied to all from Durban. Who is to be singled out for congratulation when all maintain good health, with or without the use of medicine? Who is to be praised where all work in harmony? Hence I for one shall now praise God alone Who has all along given the right inspiration to the people everywhere, with the result that all have unitedly and courageously stuck to their duty. But I must say repeatedly that, though the work referred to above was necessary, the more important work is yet to be done. It would be a great mistake for anyone to imagine that we would succeed only by boycotting [the Permit Office] and without
 
 
 any hardships, without being imprisoned or deported. We ought to remember that “Happiness comes if we suffer.”libtech_246_footnoteMoreover, without the experience of suffering, the true value of happiness cannot be known. How can he value sunshine who has not braved cold? If every pebble were a diamond, who would touch a diamond?
 HAMIDIA SOCIETY
 This Society has been working with extraordinary courage. I can see that the struggle we are engaged in is a righteous war. We are faced with the question of our faith. Prayers are being offered in the mosques: “Oh God! Help us if we are right.” Only this choice is now being placed before the people—either the law or the faith. A forceful speech in this strain was made last Sunday by Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar. Quoting verses from the Koran, he proved that “the Muslims had but one duty, which was that now their petition should be placed before God alone. The true deputation is to wait upon Him alone. That Great Judge is not influenced by anyone. He does not yield to anyone’s pressure, and the colour of the skin does not count with Him. He scrutinizes onlythe colour of our hearts. With Him on one’s side one willnever suffer defeat.” I advise all my Indian  brethren to have these words of the Moulvi Saheb firmly engraved in their minds.
 MEETING AT GERMISTON
 The Sanatan Veda Dharma Sabha organized a meeting in celebration of the birth anniversary of Lord Krishna. There, too, the same note was to be heard. Many Hindus were present. Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Polak and Mr. MacIntyre were also there. Maharaj Ram Sundar Pundit explained how a Hindu who believed in God would never submit to the Asiatic Act. Contributions were received at this meeting from the Khatris, from Babu Talevant Singh, and from Mr. Khanderia.
 SOME TIMID INDIANS
 Some timid Indians have addressed a letter to General Smuts through a lawyer in Pretoria.libtech_247_footnoteIt states that if only  a  little  relief  is promised by the Government, these gentlemen are willing to yield. I ought to say that such letters weaken our struggle. But I do not believe that there will be any harm in the end. For, if many Indians remain firm in their pledge, we are bound ultimately to win. But I would also add that we would have to go through more suffering on account of
 
 such timid representations. Moreover, by making trivial demands we show that we do not understand the real nature of our struggle. That struggle is for maintaining the prestige of the Indian community, for preserving our honour. We may call it our bread, and the timid letter referred to above would mean our being satisfied with dust in place of bread. It would not mean that we had won honour or that our honour had been saved merely because the police would not inspect our permits in public or would ask for our signature in place of ten finger-prints. For, the humiliating law would even in that case certainly remain. It would mean that instead of iron fetters, they would put on us fetters of some lighter metal. Our struggle is to break the fetters and smash them to pieces.
 MY REQUEST
 The letter in question has already been dispatched. But it is my request to the gentlemen who sent it and to the other Indians that, if they cannot keep their patience, if they cannot overcome the greed for money, they should please submit to the law without putting in any applications. In doing so, they will do less harm to the community andwill be considered to be lesser cowards. And my advice will be the same if, by chance, all Indians lose their good sense and become timid.
 HOW TO MITIGATE EFFECT OF LETTER
 Let us consider how to minimize or counteract the harm done by this letter. It suggests that all Indians are not behind the struggle being carried on by the British Indian Association. In point of fact, too, this is correct. It, therefore, became the duty of the Association to show how many Indians there were who accepted its views. Of course, when the proper time comes the difference between the earthen pot and the metal pot will be discovered. But the truthful man never needs to hide his truthfulness. Thinking along these lines, Mr. Gandhi suggested to the Hamidia Islamic Society that a short petition should be prepared in the different languages to the effect that the signatories were strongly opposed to the law and did not accept it, and the signatures of all Indians should be obtained on it. It cannot  be  doubted that such action will greatly strengthen our struggle. This suggestion was accepted by the Moulvi Saheb, Mr. Omarji Sale and other gentlemen. But Mr. M. S. Coovadia having expressed himself against it, its consideration was postponed to next Sunday. I expect that it will be passed unanimously then. On that assumption, I make the following suggestions for all. If the proposal is accepted:
l.	Copies of the petition will be sent to every town.
 
  Signatures 	should be 	obtained on two 	copies, with the signatory’s 	name, occupation and residence.  The 	person obtaining 	signatures should sign 	his name at the 	corner of the petition, which means that he is a witness.  No 	signature should be 	taken before 	the person 	signing has properly 	read it.  Copies 	of the 	petition should 	be kept 	clean, and 	as the signatures 	in duplicate 	are obtained, 	the copies 	should be passed 	on to the Association.  Signatures 	to the petition 	should be 	obtained within 	 ten  days.  It 	is necessary to 	keep volunteers 	ready for obtaining 	signatures, so 	that there may 	be no loss of time.  The 	person signing should do 	so only if 	he is firm and 	is prepared 	to fight 	to the end.  If 	the signatures obtained 	are very few, 	the petition 	will certainly 	not be 	despatched to 	the Government.   It 	will be 	a good thing, and 	will save time if, 	on reading this, 	people in 	every town 	communicate to 	the Association 	by telegram or letter the strength of the Indian population in it. 
 Even if this petition is not sent to the Government, by obtaining the signatures we shall have known the measure of truth and courage in the people. If most of us are not true and sincere, we shall certainly not win. But at the same time I also agree that if, after once taking up the idea of this petition, we are not able to send it, to that extent our weakness will have been exposed. But those who depend on God are glad, rather than frightened, when a weakness is exposed. It is wisdom to sort out the bad coins from a mixed heap of good and bad coins. So much the less would be the burden for us to carry. All these ideas are simple enough to be immediately understood.
 VICE AMONG US
 What I observed at the last meeting of the Hamidia Society had led me to think that whatever vices we have will be swept away along with our cowardice. It cannot be that we shall continue to be deceitful and cunning after having placed our trust in God on the question of the new law. So pure is our present struggle! There is a Hindu in Pretoria who, it is said, cruelly beat up another Indian, having been intoxicated with drink. The latter became unconscious. The assailant has not yet been prosecuted. I do not know what the result will be. But it appears to be widely known that he has committed the assault. In
 Johannesburg some Indians are charged with robbing a poor Indian. There is no doubt that the Indian was robbed. It is positively asserted that the accused are innocent. Yet another Indian who has been arrested is charged with minting counterfeit coins. All these  cases show that there are vices among some of us. Speaking at the Society meeting, Mr. Essop Mia stated that such cases should not at all occur. And in case there are civil suits or disputes, they should be settled privately among the parties without filling the coffers of lawyers and the Government. I believe this suggestion deserves to be carefully considered and acted upon. If in consequence of our present struggle we forget the differences between Hindus and Muslims, give  up  internal quarrels and, in case they occur, settle them privately, and also give up other vices, the thirteen thousand Indians will earn the admiration of the entire world, and their names will be recorded for all time in God’s book. It is an act of no small meanness that one Indian should falsely accuse another through malice or blackmail him. That one man should assault another is not merely petty cruelty. It is no little shame that an Indian should take liquor. With a little effort, these evil habits can be eradicated. To smash the new law, I believe it is necessary also to stamp out these evils.
 FIRST-CLASS CAB
 The Johannesburg Municipality contemplates a regulation debarring Indians from using a first-class cab. Mr. Essop Mia has addressed a strong protest against this.libtech_248_footnotelibtech_249_footnotelibtech_250_footnoteAnd now it is proposed   to amend the regulation so as to enable an Indian lawyer or doctor to use such a cab. Is it intended that an Indian lawyer or doctor desiring to hire such a cab should carry a signboard on his person? How else will the “cabbie” recognize a doctor or a lawyer? A lawyer in rags can hire a first-class cab, but a well-dressed Indian who is not a lawyer or doctor cannot do so! Mr. Essop Mia has sent another letter of protestlibtech_251_footnoteagainst such an absurd amendment, saying that such an amendment will amount to adding insult to injury. The Indian community therefore does not want this amendment. This proposal of the refuse-removing Municipality should be a shock to those taking out new registers.

159,,WHAT BITTER SUFFERING !,"
    
 The communication received from Mr. Ritch this week will explain to everyone what bitter suffering will follow if the Indian helmsmen, after having put in a strenuous effort, desert the ship of their gaol-going struggle at the sight of the angry waves. All the same, let us consider why it will be so.
 The South Africa British Indian Committee has come to place its trust in us. The Committee therefore openly expresses its sympathy. Mr. Ritch has written a letterlibtech_255_footnotelibtech_256_footnoteto the Prime Minister on behalf of the Committee in which he gives a correct account of what we want. This is not a struggle for securing petty concessions. We would not spend so extravagantly merely to have our iron shackles gilded. Mr. Ritch makes a categorical demand that the law must be repealed. The reader should go through the letter carefully to see what other demands have been made. If the Indian pilots now abandon the ship that is nearing theshore, what curses will not descend upon They are the custodians of the good name of India—of the honour of Indians. They have been wrestling with fire, and it is nothing to be afraid of if they receive a few burns. He who is afraid will be destroyed.
 Consider what the editor of The Saturday Review says. It is a journal of standing and carries considerable weight. It belongs to the Conservative Party, yet it asserts forcefully that the Indian community is right in having resolved not to submit to the law but to go to gaol
 
 instead. If the British Government should leave Indians in the lurch, it would be a disgrace. Having achieved so much, will the Indian leaders now prove that the struggle was a sham? Blind in their greed  of money, will they plunge spears into the bowels of thousands? Will they prove the whole nation to be cowardly and abject?
 The Nation is said to be a very independent journal. It wields great influence with the Liberal Party. An Englishman writing under well-known initials states therein that no other event has created so much stir and displeasure in India as the oppression now being inflicted on Indians in the Transvaal. This shows that, if in the present fight Indians lose heart they will do much harm to India. The resolve which the Transvaal Indians have made, and which has received so much publicity, is without parallel even in India. It is, therefore, imperative that Indian leaders realize their responsibility.

160,,“WAX IN THE HANDS OF LAW”,"
    
 It is with a sense of extreme shame and regret that we publish in this issue the petitionlibtech_257_footnotelibtech_258_footnotethat has been made by ‘‘leading Indians” from cities like Pretoria. We consider this to be a base step, and lay the blame for it chiefly on Mr. Hajee Cassim. His name is mentioned in every meeting of Indians; hence we feel no hesitation in making it public. We consider it our duty to do so. Though we blame Mr. Hajee Cassim, we realize that it is not possible for us to say that other Indians in his position would never have done what he has done. Therefore, we regard his disgrace as the disgrace of us all.
 The language of the petition is abject and worthy of a slave. In using the words “we are wax in the hands of law”, they have sinned against God, who alone holds sway over us. Why then should we use towards oppressive rulers language which is appropriate in regard to Him alone?
 The demands made are pointless. They prove that we have not at all understood the real significance of the struggle. We have stated this even earlier.libtech_259_footnote
 Now we only ask Mr. Hajee Cassim and his supporters whether they do not realize that their disgraceful petition lowers the prestige of Indians and does harm to the cause to which they are wedded. If this
 
 is so, what will be the use of the wealth saved by such means? Therefore, if there is still time, we beg of them that they sacrifice themselves for the good of the community. Just as the Government pays no attention to the petitions of Indians, will Mr. Hajee Cassim’s “government” act in the same manner ?
 In that case, we tell Mr. Hajee Cassim’s “subjects”, Indians who hang upon his words, that instead of looking up to others they are at present only to depend on their own courage and on God. We are all to be on the side, not of any Indian, but of God. They should plunge themselves into the struggle, putting their honour into His hands. We hope that every Indian will think for himself.

161,,RITCH’S LABOURS,"
    
 Mr. Ritch has surpassed all expectations. He is indefatigable. We publish elsewhere a translationlibtech_260_footnoteof the cabled summary of his letter to The Times of London. It deserves careful reading.
 On the one hand, some Indians are giving up the struggle and betraying signs of weakness. On the other, Mr. Ritch and the Commi- ttee are working very hard on our behalf. The Times of London has lashed out at the Transvaal Government while commenting on the letter of Mr. Ritch; this is bound to have some effect. When such a fine struggle is being carried on in England, Indians, for their part, must remain united and act upon their resolution with courage, placing their trust in God. This reckoning stands to reason. We want that no Indian should ignore it.

162,,HARASSMENT OF INDIANS,"
    
 Four Indians were ordered to leave the Transvaal. While on their way to Delagoa Bay, they were stopped at the Transvaal border, taken into custody and subjected to much harassment. Mr. Gandhi has written a letterlibtech_261_footnotelibtech_262_footnoteto the Registrar in this connection which we publish
 
 elsewhere. Though these people are willing to leave the Transvaal, they cannot do so. If they remain in the Transvaal, they will be liable to a month’s imprisonment. What are they to do then? What does this all show except that the Government simply wants to harass  the Indians, taking them to be a harmless lot? This case fully exposes the intentions of the Government in enforcing the Asiatic Registration Act. Will Indians go on tamely submitting to all this?

163,,DUTY OF DISOBEYING LAWS [2],"
    
 We have already given some portion of Thoreau’s essay on this subject.libtech_263_footnoteThe rest is given below.libtech_264_footnote
 A wise person will only be useful as a man, and will not submit himself to be [treated as] clay. He who associates himself with the America of today is as good as a coward. I cannot recognize that government to be my government which is the slave’s government also. Mankind has the right to refuse allegiance to and resist the government when its tyranny becomes unendurable. Some people say that such is not the case now. That is, the attack is not on them; if others are attacked, those who hold this opinion are unconcerned with it.
 All machines have their friction, and the same is true of every State. Perhaps it may not be necessary to oppose [the State] in order to free it of such friction. But when the friction comes to have its machine, when tyranny takes the form of law, such a State cannot be tolerated by true men.
 One must do justice and maintain truth, cost what it may. If I have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowning man, I should restore it to him though I may be drowned myself. In the same way, we must cease to hold slaves though it cost the existence of the American State.
 We are accustomed to say that the mass of men are unprepared; but improvement is slow because the few who desire it do not have enough courage. It is not so important that many should be as good as you as that there be some absolute goodness somewhere; for that will leaven the whole lump. There are thousands who in opinion are opposed to slavery, but act contrary to their view. They, esteeming themselves children of Washington, sit down with their hands in their
 
 pockets and say that they know not what to do, and do nothing. At the most they give lectures and send petitions.
 There are nine hundred and ninety nine persons who profess virtue to one virtuous man. Yet he who acts virtuously, though he be the only one, is of far greater worth than those who only profess it. There may be many warders of a treasure, but none of them can give away a single farthing from it. The owner of the treasure may be only one, yet he can give away everything from it.
 Voting for the right is not the same thing as doing the right. When the majority shall at length vote for the abolition of slavery, it will be because there is but little slavery left to be abolished. That is, the foundation for the [formal] abolition was [already] laid by the men who abolished it in practice.
 I do not say that it is a man’s duty, as a matter of course, to eradicate a wrong wherever he finds it; but it is his duty, at least, not to give it practically his support. How can a man be satisfied to entertain an opinion merely, and enjoy it ?
 If someone steals my goods, I do not rest satisfied with saying that it was not a good thing that I was robbed, but I take effectual steps to recover what was stolen, and see that I am not robbed again. He who acts on his principles becomes a different kind of man. Such a man cares neither for his country nor for his relatives nor his friends. But, serving truth, he serves all of them.
 We admit that unjust laws exist. Do we transgress them at once? Men generally say that these laws will be repealed when a majority of people disapprove them. They think that if they should resist, the remedy would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the government itself that the remedy is worse than the evil, not of those who resist it.
 I do not hesitate to say that even if there is only one man in Massachusetts who is opposed to slavery, he should effectually withdraw his support from the government, both in person and property, without waiting till there is a majority on his side. For, he is not alone. God is ever on his side. Any man more right than his neighbours constitutes a majority of one already. I meet the American government directly and face to face once a year in the person of its tax-gatherer. At that time, It must definitely refuse to pay the tax.
 I know this well that even if only one honest man in this State of Massachusetts refuses to pay taxes in order to oppose slavery, and is locked up in gaol therefor, it would be the abolition of slavery in America. What is once well done is done for ever. But we love better
 to talk about it; that we say is our mission. There are many newspapers in the service of the movement for abolition of slavery, but not one man.
 Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the  true  place for a just man is also a prison. Hence, the proper place today for good people in Massachusetts is in her prisons. In a slave State prison is the only house in which a free man can abide with honour. If they think that in that case their influence will be lost and none will be left to fight injustice, they do not know how to fight evil. They do not know how much stronger truth is than error. Those who are in gaol, suffering the tyranny of injustice, can combat injustice  more effectively from there than from outside. So long as a minority conforms to the majority, it is not even a minority. They must throw in their whole weight in the opposite direction.
 When talking with my neighbours, I find that they dread the consequences of disobedience to the government to their property and family. For my own part, I would find it depressing to think that I ever rely on the protection of the State.
 I think it is disgraceful to submit to a tyrannical State. It is easy and good to oppose it. I have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was put into gaol once on this account for one night. As I stood considering the walls of the prison and its iron gates, I could not help being struck with the foolishness of the State. For, those who had imprisoned me must have thought that I was made of flesh and bones only. Those fools did not know that though confined within walls, I was freer than others. I did not feel that I was in a prison. Rather, I thought that those who were outside were the real prisoners. As they could not reach me, they punished my body. In consequence, I became more free, and my ideas in regard to the State became more dangerous. I have seen that, when small children can do nothing to a person, they abuse his dog. In the same way, the State hurts my body as it can do nothing to me.
 I also found that the State was afraid of hurting my body. So I lost all my remaining respect for it.libtech_265_footnote

164,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 WRETCHED INDIA
 Everywhere the Indian is in a sad plight. Now comes a report from America that Indian labourers in Washington were belaboured by cowardly whites and that four of them were wounded. The rest of the labourers are running away in panic. These white assailants  I regard as cowards, for it was not particularly brave for a thousand of them to have attacked the innocent labourers. They are cowards who oppress those weaker than themselves. There is a proverb among us that an angry potter will twist the ears of his donkey.libtech_266_footnotelibtech_267_footnoteSimilarly, these cowardly whites assault the employees, because they can do nothing to the whites who employ Indians. The truly brave are those who use their strength against persons stronger than themselves.
 The Mayor of Washington has assured the Indian labourers that he will protect them and that they are welcome to return to their jobs. He has engaged a special police force to protect them. This fact does credit to the Mayor. There is a Press report that the Foreign Office in England is also looking after them.
 The lesson to be drawn from this assault seems to be that Indians will be able to hold their own in foreign countries only  if  they cultivate courage. If the whites kick us every day, no protection can be given by the Imperial Government or any other Government. God does not help those who live like cowards. Living amidst tigers and wolves, we can do only two things. True courage lies in absence of fear of wild animals. Tigers and wolves too have been created by God, and we should view them without any ill-will. This can be practised only by saints or true devotees after a long period of devotion to God. There is a second type of courage which consists in facing tigers and wolves with weapons. This also involves risk to one’s person. Such is the plight of those living in the midst of whites. A saint will not go to distant lands seeking a livelihood. Ordinarily, therefore, we need courage of the second kind. To have that courage we need to be brave in facing physical dangers and to discipline the body. According to Mrs.   Besantlibtech_268_footnotelibtech_269_footnote,   all   Indians,   high   and   low,   should   learn   wrestling and other physical exercises to train all parts of the body. All this will
 
 be possible only if we feel the urge of self-respect and cultivate a sense of manliness.
 POLAK’S LETTER
 An Englishman writing in The Star says that, on the whole and comparatively speaking, Indian merchants are honest. That is why the white merchants give them credit. However, the writer adds that, since the money earned by the Indian merchants does not circulate in the Transvaal, they should be turned out. Mr. Polak has replied to this in a long letter saying that Indian money does not circulate much in the Transvaal only because Indians have no rights of land or those of any other kind. He has mentioned the instance of the Indian offer of help when contributions were raised for fire relief in Potchefstroom, and has [otherwise] discussed the whole Indian question quite well.
 PERMIT OFFICE
 The Permit Office goes on with its perambulations. There is no need now to congratulate the remaining places. Everywhere the same thing happens. All have been boycotting the Permit Office. We have found it easy to take this line of action, and it does not require much courage. Congratulations will be deserved by those who remain true at the right moment.
 RUMOURS
 Every day strange rumours are afloat. Some say  that  the Memons have taken out registers, others that the Konkanis are losing courage. Yet others say that among the Surtislibtech_270_footnotelibtech_271_footnoteand Hindus of Pretoria, there is a move to submit to the disgrace. As the critical hour approaches, such rumours are bound to gain currency. Cowards infect others too with the contagion of their own fear.
 ABSURD THREATS
 It is found that there are some “brave”. Indians who, when piqued against a fellow-Indian, say that they will get themselves registered if the friend does not do a particular thing. Such a threat causes both amusement and sorrow. “If you do not do this, I shall jump into a ditch.” One cannot understand what the other person will lose thereby. Hence, those who receive such threats should give an unhesitating reply to these braves: ‘The gates of the slavery office are always open. I for my part wish that those who have lost their manliness should get themselves registered.”The test of the genuine ones will prove their worth a hundred per cent. The Friend of Bloemfontein was not wrong when it said that the poisonousTransvaal
 
 law would draw out the brave to risk their heads in fighting, leaving the cowards behind. We read in the prize poem on gaol-going:
 “Shall we live as thieves and informers, As cheats and robbers?”
 Such a time is fast approaching. I am sorry to have to say that those submitting to the law will be reduced merely to that level.

165,"September 17, 1907",LETTER TO W. V. HULSTEYN,"
    
 [JOHANNESBURG,]
 September 17, 1907
SIR WILLEM VAN HULSTEYN, M. L. A.
 P. O. BOX 46 JOHANNESBURG SIR,
 I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant regarding the letter addressed to you by the Assistant Honorary Secretary of the British Indian Association on the 14th instant.
 You have been pleased to advise the community represented by my Association to assist in carrying out the laws of this Colony. I beg to draw your attention to the fact that, hitherto, the community has always done so, and it will continue to do so, whenever such laws do not put on the community an unwarranted affront and do not wound its religious susceptibilities. To the Asiatic Registration Act, British Indians have undoubtedly been advised by my Association not to submit, because, in my humble opinion, it is their duty first to submit to a higher law, namely, that which dictates to mankind an idea of self-respect and respect for declarations solemnly and sincerely made. To accept the Registration Act, in my humble opinion, takes away every vestige of manliness from Indians and would make them godless, and it was in order to invite your attention to this fundamental issue that the letter of the 14th instant was addressed to you. It would be childish for any responsible British Indian to advise the community to enter upon a life-and-death struggle and to be prepared to sacrifice all their material wealth for the sake of avoiding finger impressions.
 My Association is quite aware of the threat you have seen fit to use in your address—the subject-matter of this correspondence—and
 to repeat in your letter under reply, but I hope you will pardon me for saying that it loses its force on those who have never concealed from themselves the fact that the Government is not only strong enough to enforce the Law but that it has declared its intention so to do. Whether such enforcement of the Law will redound to its credit, or whether, if my countrymen remain firm, all the credit will be due to them for undergoing unmerited suffering is a question which can safely be left to posterity to decide.
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servant,
 M. K. GANDHI HONORARY SECRETARY,

          [JOHANNESBURG, 
   TO  THE 	HONOURABLE 	THE 	COLONIAL 	SECRETARY 	PRETORIA SIR,  Before 	September 21, 1907] 
  	We, the undersigned British Indians residing in this Colony, hereby 	beg to dissociate ourselves entirely from the letter addressed to 	you onbehalf of some leading Indians of Pretoria, Pietersburg, 	Standerton and Middelburg by Messrs Stegmann, Esselen and Roos, and 	dated the 30th day of August, 1907, regarding the Asiatic Law 	Amendment Act, No. 2 of 1907.  	We respectfully submit that nothing short of total repeal of the Act 	can meet the difficult situation that has arisen. In our humble 	opinion the Act is degrading to our self-respect, offensive to our 	religions, and in its incidence it is such as can be thought of only 	in connection with dangerous criminals. Moreover, the solemn 	declaration made by us renders it imperative for us, as honest 	citizens of the Empire and God-fearing men, not to submit to the 	provisions of the Act, irrespective of any consequences which we may 	have to suffer, and which we understand to be imprisonment, 	banishment and/or loss or confiscation of our property.  	In making the above statement, we do not desire to shirk an enquiry 	into the allegations as to surreptitious entry by British Indians on 	a wholesale scale, or to refuse to hold documents that  in  the  	opinion of the Government may sufficiently identify us.  	We therefore respectfully pray that the Government will be pleased 	to recognise British Indians in the Transvaal as men  and worthy 	citizens in this free and self-governing Colony.  We 	have the honour to be,  Sir,  Your 	obedient servants,  INSTRUCTIONS 	WITH 	REFERENCE 	TO THE TAKING 	OF SIGNATURES 	FOR    
 THE ABOVE PETITION:
 All 	signatures should be 	in ink.  Every 	sheet provides for 	50 signatures. 	No more 	than 50 signatures 	should, therefore, be 	taken on 	each sheet. Signatures 	should be taken 	in duplicate.  In 	the address 	column should be given 	the number 	of Street, 	as well as the Stand 	wherever possible. The name of the town in which the signatures are taken may be given only once Great 	care should be taken 	not to soil 	the sheets.  So 	far as 	possible signatures 	should be given 	legibly. Where they are 	not in English, 	the person 	taking them should 	give the 	English equivalent; and, 	where the 	signatory puts 	only a cross, 	the cross 	should be witnessed 	by the 	person taking the 	signatures.  In 	no case should 	signatures be 	taken without the 	person signing 	reading the petition 	and if 	he cannot read 	any of the 	languages, it 	should be 	read over to him.  The 	person taking the 	signatures should 	sign at the 	foot on 	the line 	reserved for the purpose.   Duplicate 	sheets should be 	sent to the Secretary, British Indian 	Association, Box 6522, 	Johannesburg, as early 	as possible.

168,,A MONSTER PETITION,"
    
 The Transvaal Indians are to be congratulated on having organised a monster petition to the Government. It forms a complete answer to the document we had the misfortune to reproduce last week.libtech_275_footnoteThe petitioners have, once for all,  placed  on  record,  in  the
 
 briefest terms possible, the main issue. The petitioners, in frank but respectful language, inform the local Government that nothing short of total repeal of the Asiatic Registration Act can possibly meet the emergency. They couple the statement with another to the effect that, in asking for a repeal, they do not shirk any inquiry into  the  allegation of a surreptitious influx of Asiatics, nor do they decline to exchange the permits at present held by them. The fundamental issue, therefore, is—are Indians or are they not to be recognised as self-respecting citizens of the Empire? Our contemporary, The Star, the other day twitted Indians on having misled their  friends  in England as to the real cause of the struggle, and it credited British Indians with fighting against ten digit imprints only. Almost at the time The Star wrote, Mr. Ritch, the indefatigable Secretary of  the South Africa British Indian Committee, was writing to the Lancashire Daily Post, from which we take the following:
 It is, of course, true that the Asiatic Registration Act requires British Indians as well as alien Asiatics ‘to submit to a registration for identity’, and that the regulations for administration of the Act include the taking of the ten digit imprints, a precaution associated almost entirely with criminality. But to rightly understand the full measure of the burden of disability borne by our Indian fellow-subjects in the Transvaal, it is necessary to recognise that thishumiliation is but an incident, and unimportant compared with the larger particular principle involved in the question of the right of the Transvaal British Indian community to treatment as civilised subjects of the Empire, and as such to protection by their overlord from their invasion and dispossession of that most elementary right.
 The case for Indians could not be put more clearly.

 "
169,,THE WEENEN LICENSING APPEAL,"
    
 It is not often that we find ourselves in agreement with decisions of trade-licensing officers and licensing boards, but hard as Mr. Bhayat’s caselibtech_276_footnotelibtech_277_footnotewas,  we  are  bound  to  admit  that,  on  principle,  the decision of the Licensing Officer, as also of the Board, was free from reproach. The Licensing Officer, Mr. Ingram, gave full and luminous reasons for his decision, and we believe him when he states that, had the position been reversed as to race, his decision would have been the same.   In   view   of   the   prejudice   that   exists   in   the   Colony, our
 
1906.
 countrymen must make up their minds that unrestricted trade is impossible in Natal, if not in South Africa. The minimum that must be guaranteed, and that, in our opinion, must be insisted upon at any cost, is that existing licences shall be sacredly guarded, but with reference to new applications, as we understand Mr. Bhayat’s was, local opinion, distribution of licences, and the requirements of supply and demand must largely guide Licensing Officers. Indeed, without the aid of the law, it is open to any community to boycott any class or number of traders or others whom it may not want. It is only when the assistance of the law is invoked, in order to feed the fire of prejudice, that the latter becomes insufferable, and a stronger hand is necessary to undo the mischief. At the same time, cases like Mr. Bhayat’s cannot but evoke sympathy. Here is a man, who is evidently respected by all classes, is an able merchant of long standing, has rendered assistance to the British Government in the very Division in which he wants a licence to trade, and there is no moral or economic ground on which his application can be rejected, but these hard cases will always occur wherever clashing interests crop up, and where self-interest is allowed largely to dictate a particular policy. So it is prudent for the victims to recognise facts as they stand, and to so marshal their forces as to oppose them all to a deprivation of existing rights and  their self-respect.
 Indian Opinion, 21-9-1907
 "
170,,TRANSVAAL STRUGGLE,"
    
 In this issue we publish a translation of the papers sent by Mr. Ritch, to which every reader should pay very close attention. A battle royal is going on in England on the subject of the new law. The struggle is entirely the result of the courage of Indians. Prominent leaders in England are getting convinced that Indians will do what they say. We have never seen such a discussion of the Indian question as the one that took place in connection with the Loan Bill. We do not exaggerate when we say that this is the first instance in the last fifty years of such vehement argument from both sides. Mr. Lyttelton is the leader of the Conservative Party. He was once Colonial Secretary. He supported our rights with great force. Sir Charles Dilke is  a well-known Liberal Member, and at one time there was a probability of his becoming Prime Minister. He categorically stated that it was the duty of the Imperial Government to intervene. Apart from this, other members like Mr. Bonar Law, Mr. Cox and Mr. O’Grady also made speeches all of which were encouraging to us.
 If we take newspapers into account, we find that journals such as The Times of London, the Yorkshire Post, The Observer and the Pall Mall Gazette have written strongly in our favour. Sir Charles Bruce, above all, is beyond praise. He has given a hard slap to the Imperial Government.
 If this is the result merely of the Indian community having boycotted the Registration Office, is it not likely that the whole of Britain will be aroused when Indians are cruelly imprisoned? Moreover, if we think of Sir Henry’s reply, it is obvious that he has not altogether declined to intervene. He has only pointed out that this is not an opportune time to do so. It only means that, if the Indian community remains firm to the last and suffers imprisonment or deportation, the Imperial Government will not remain silent. If our eyes are not opened even by these signs, which he who runs may read, and if we do not take courage from them, we shall deserve all the humiliation that can be inflicted on us. At the same time, it should also be borne in mind that if we give up the struggle now, the forces which are acting in our favour will turn against us. We see the hand of God in this. God always helps through men or other means. Therefore, Indians, be vigilant!

 "
171,,LICENSING ACT OF NATAL,"
    
 We are sorry that, in Weenen, Mr. Bhayat has lost the appeallibtech_278_footnotelibtech_279_footnotefor a licence which he had made to the Licensing Board. Mr. Bhayat had a very strong case. He is an influential businessman; he had helped the Government during the war, and he is wealthy. It can never be that a man like him will be refused a licence under any law with a moral basis.
 Nevertheless, we have to admit that, in the present circumstances, the decision of the Board cannot be considered unjust. We should remember that, in Natal or South Africa, complete freedom of trade is impossible for the Indian community. The Licensing Officer may or may not issue a licence, having regard to the local feelings and the number of merchants in the area, and it will be futile in the present circumstances to protest against his decisions. It behoves a wise man to give due thought to the circumstances before taking any step, and to
 
 
 pay attention to what is happening around him. Many hardships are being inflicted on the Indian community. We have to make up our mind in advance as to which one of these is to be given the utmost weight. Our foremost need today is to preserve our status and self-respect. If we have these, the rest will follow as a matter of course. Whatever rights we enjoy today with self-respect should be preserved. That means that we must cling to the licences which are being withdrawn, and try to retain at any cost, even by going to gaol, the licences which we hold. We are convinced that if the Indian community can do this much, the problem of the new licences will solve itself. We are sure that so long as we are taken to be cowards, our efforts will bear no fruit. We do not mean to say that new licences will not be issued in any case. Wherever the Licensing Officer is kind, or where there is no opposition from the Europeans, new licences will no doubt continue to be issued. It only means that there can be no friendship and love where one side looks down upon the other. Hence our first aim should be to preserve our self-respect, and win regard as a brave people.

172,,INDIAN PUBLIC LIBRARY,"
    
 Mr. Shelat has resigned to take up an appointment elsewhere, after attending to the Library with great diligence, though for a brief period. His vacancy is filled by Mr. Tarmahomed Sumar, and Mr. Jusab Osman has agreed to help. We offer congratulations to both of them. It is very necessary that members of the community should come forward for public work in large numbers. It is a sign  of weakness on our part to ask, whenever someone leaves, how his place can be filled. Anyone will find it difficult to fill the place of Mr. Diwan in so far as hard work and regularity are concerned. However, we are confident that Mr. Tarmahomed and Mr.Jusab Osman will with utmost diligence complete the task that they have undertaken.
 A library is an indication of education. There is no need to prove that it confers many benefits. It is, therefore, the duty of every Indian to help maintain this library.

CABLE FROM HON’BLE PROF. GOKHALE
 The following cable has been received by the British Indian Association, Johannesburg, from the Hon’ble Prof. Gokhale, and sent to us for publication:libtech_280_footnote
 Following struggle closely. Anxious interest. Deepest sympathy. Admiration. Trust securely Divine Will.
 The Hon’ble Prof. Gokhale is known to every patriotic Indian. He is a member of the Central Indian Legislature. His cable ought to raise the spirit of every Indian to the highest degree of courage. That Prof. Gokhale has sent the cable means that the whole of India will now be aroused, and will run to our rescue.
 REPLY TO GABLE
 A meeting of the British Indian Association was convened as soon as the cable was received. The meeting was attended by Messrs Essop Mia, Coovadia, Ahmed Moosaji, Fancy, Omarji Sale, Emam Abdool Cadir, Mahomed Adamji, Ali Omar, Ahmed Halim, Cassim Moosa, Alibhai Akuji, Shah, Moosaji Ahmed, Daud Ismail, Ahmed Ise, Ismail Suleman, Dahya Rama, Cama and Momniyat. It was resolved unanimously to send the following cable:libtech_281_footnote

 NEW LAW
 Krugersdorp and Zeerust did just what other places had done. I was about to say that they have displayed the same courage. If, however, we call the present boycott an act of courage, what word shall we use for the real boycott when the time for it comes? We all know that a man who does not receive the “stamp of slavery” in one place
 
Thumb-impressions in Bombay
 The complaint which was made in the Readers’ Views column of The Bombay Gazette, and which we reproduced in this paper, that a new law had come into force requiring thumb-impressions from all persons other than Europeans for the purposes of the Registration Department of the High Court, appears to have been unfounded. This is seen from the copy of the new law placed by the Government on the table in answer to a question in the Legislative Council by Mr. O. P. Dixit. Under that law, if any person wants to get a document of any kind registered in the Department, he will have to affix the impression of his right-hand thumb on that document, as also on the Government register recording thumb-impressions. The following rules have been framed in this connection:
  When 	the person registering a 	document is an educated 	man and is personally 	known to 	the Registrar, he 	will not be 	required to 	give his 	thumb-impression.  No 	thumb-impression will 	be required 	also if 	the person 	registering a 	document is 	a European 	Iady or 	gentleman or 	any other 	respectable person 	about whose 	identity there can be no doubt.  Persons 	whose right-hand 	thumbs cannot be 	used for 	any reason will be 	required to 	give the 	impression of 	their left-hand thumb, 	or, if 	that is 	not possible, 	of any 	of the 	other fingers. The impression will be taken in the presence of the Registrar. 
 can get it in another. It is not likely that anyone will be enamoured of the black mark of shame. All are therefore able to sit back and watch what Johannesburg does. If a large number of people are waiting like this, the pot of our evil will certainly burst, and Indians will be crushed under it.libtech_283_footnoteWe should feel satisfied only when those who have kept their courage so far keep it till the end, regardless of what Johannesburg does. Hence, while Krugersdorp and Zeerust do deserve to be congratulated on their firmness, the time of real test for them and for all others is yet to come.
 WHICH PLACES HAVE NOT BEEN VISITED?
 The Office will be at Boksburg on the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th, at Germiston on the 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th and at Benoni on the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th. These places seem to have received the Government’s special favour. For, the Indians at each of these places have been allowed four days to take out their documents of slavery. But the Indians there are firm and it appears that no one will go to take out the obnoxious title-deed [of slavery]. Meetings have already been held at Boksburg and Germiston and all are resisting the soiling of their hands. Hence the “officers’ holiday” is unlikely to have a break yet.
 HAS WIND CHANGED?
 Till now it was Mr. Chamney, Mr. James Cody, Mr. Richard  Cody and Mr. Sweet who went about enjoying fresh air. Hereafter it will not be the same band. Bloemhof, Wolmeransstad, Lichtenburg, Piet Retief, Ermilo, Carolina and Bethal will not be visited by these gentlemen. For these places other officers have been appointed. At each of them, new officers will be present on the 17th, 18th and 19th. Mr. Hull is appointed for Bloemhof, Mr. Hog for Wolmeransstad, Mr. Juta for Lichtenburg, Mr. Levi for Piet Retief, Mr. Keyresville for Ermilo, Mr. John for Carolinaand Mr. Bangley for Bethal. I do not want to guess why this change hasbeen made. On the face of it, the reason appears to be that there are not many Indians at these places and that, these places being scattered wide apart from one another, the attack on Johannesburg cannot take place in October if the band mentioned above were moved from one place to the other.
 JOHANNESBURG IN TIGHT GRIP
 The attack on Johannesburg will begin on October 1. A trio has been appointed here, the two Codys and Mr. Sweet. Hence the time is
 
 drawing near when the boasts which Johannesburg has always been making will be tested. At Pretoria, Mr. Gandhi had boasted that it would have been a good thing if the Office had first gone to Johannesburg.libtech_284_footnoteMr. Essop Mia and Mr. Coovadia also had spoken in the same strain. Moreover, Mr. Essop Mia had written a strong letter to Mr. Roos to say that the Association and particularly Johannesburg had nothing to do with the absurd draft prepared by Mr. Roos on behalf of the “leaders”. Johannesburg is the headquarters of the Association. Indians there have spoken strongly against the law. It was there that the two meetings, the one at the Empire Theatre and the other  at  the  Gaiety  Theatre,  took  place.libtech_285_footnoteIn  spite  of  all   this,  will Johannesburg yield? But there is time yet. They have got a whole month. At Pretoria, it was in the very last days that men soiled their hands. It is probable, therefore, that the first three weeks of October at Johannesburg will pass off well. But what if Johannesburg goes through the fourth week, too, without even one Indian so much as looking at the Permit Office? It is a little difficult to answer this question. But why should we count our chickens before they are hatched?libtech_286_footnoteHowever,   I    can    guess    one    thing,    namely,    that    if Johannesburg can stage a complete boycott, the Government will be convinced that we are determined to fight to death. It should be fully realized that this struggle is intended to demonstrate that we mean what we say. Neither the Government nor anyone else is convinced that we have real courage to fight. And how can that conviction come so long as we have among us such men as Mr. Sheikh Mahomed Essak who keep on changing sides?libtech_287_footnote
 “THE BRAVES OF PIETERSBURG
 Now that I have mentioned Mr. Sheikh Mahomed Essak, let me give the reader some other news I have received. At Pietersburg, four “brave” Indians have gone in for the title-deed of slavery.libtech_288_footnotelibtech_289_footnoteI  have also been told that these four gentlemen had signed the application made from Pietersburg over the signatures of 86 Indians. So long as such things happen, how can any Indian be trusted by  the Government? How can it be believed that what we say in our petitions is true? It is also said that some affidavits have been obtained from
 
 these gentlemen. There are all sorts of rumours in circulation. It is said that they have stated that they had not applied for the title-deed of slavery earlier, because Mr. Gandhi had prevented them from doing so. Others say that they had not applied for fear of being disgraced in the eyes of the community. If these things are true, those who have made the affidavits should ask themselves whether they do not feel that fear and shame now. All the same, there is nothing wrong in those who are timid going over to the opposite camp. This struggle is such that it will sift out the timid from the brave. Then, we shall know the true nature of the disease we suffer from. The thermometer used so far did not reveal the correct degree of our fever. When the gaol thermometer is used, everyone’s correct temperature will be known.
 I am greatly pained to have to give all these names and make this comment. For, I share the shame of my brethren. I do suffer in reputation if my brethren commit a theft. It is for the faults of our own people that we have been suffering in the whole of South Africa. Because some Indians are dirty, all Indians are subjected to hardship. Because some are miserly, all come to be charged with the fault. Because some people entered illegally, the new law has been enacted and all have to suffer the consequences. The present is so serious an occasion that it will be a sin to conceal our faults. Our problems will be solved only when what is rotten within comes to the surface. We are like sweetened water being boiled into a syrup. In this process, the dirt within is bound to come out. If we cover up the dirt, our being boiled will have been in vain. I, therefore, beg to be excused by those whose names I am giving and who on that account may get angry with me. I must do my duty, all the same.
 The four gentlemen of Pietersburg having, as it were, stormed a castle in taking out their title-deed of slavery, Mr. Cassim Hajee Tar of Mafeking thought that he was left behind. Accordingly, he too has melted. What then to talk of Lazarus (Tamil) and Joseph (Tamil) of Durban? These two Tamil gentlemen have also received the brand of registration.
 UNEASINESS AT PERMIT OFFICE
 Since few Indians go to receive the stamp of slavery, the Permit Office is getting impatient. An Indian at Barberton held a permit wrongfully issued to him by a former officer. He was therefore arrested. He is now undergoing a gaol sentence of six months. Intent on not leavingBarberton empty-handed, they have obtained an application from this prisoner. We may ask what purpose will  be served by taking an application from such a person. Is it intended to issue registers by accepting the applications of those who hold no
 permits and have no right to live here? Or, as The Friend of Bloemfontein says, will the Government keep in the Transvaal Indians now in gaol and oust the rightful old residents? Let us see how the Transvaal Government takes away the rights of the lawful residents.
 NEW FINGER-PRINT REGULATION
 In the current Gazette, a regulation has been published, empowering the authorities, at their option, to take a photograph, finger-prints, physical measurements, etc., of any person in gaol, provided that such person is not a detained witness or a civil debtor. The Regulation is in consequence of a suit that was heard in the local court. This does not particularly concern Indians. But it shows that such regulations can be applied to people guilty of criminal offences.
 CAN WOMEN BE ASKED TO GIVE FINGER-PRINTS?
 Mr. Moosa Ebrahim Mansoor writes from Volksrust to say that the police demanded the permit from an  Indian  woman.  She produced it. They then asked her to give the thumb-impression, which she did on the order of her master. One cannot understand how she produced the permit. The police had not the slightest authority to ask for the thumb-impression. It was decided in the Punia caselibtech_290_footnotelibtech_291_footnotethat even a permit was not necessary for women. I see no need to take any other step in the matter. But where such things happen, it is necessary to give a warning.
 “HOW CAN WE PUT UP WITH LOSSES?”
 I have been asked how people can put up with losses likely to occur in the course of the struggle against the new law. In the first place, what one takes to be a loss is not a loss, but a gain. If we buy a carriage for a hundred rupees, we do not think it to be a loss of money, but take it as a proper return for our money. In just the same way, we have to buy our rights by forgoing our money. One who feels assured that the rights will certainly be won should not be afraid of forgoing the money. For he is sure of getting a return for it. It is true that some people may not feel certain in their minds that they will get the rights. Even such men will forgo the money now in the hope of getting the rights [later]. We always take such risks in  business. Because we occasionally lose money in a speculative transaction, we do not close down our business. If we fight with this as ourguiding principle, we shall stop talking of losses. The important thing is that
 
 
1906.
 the struggle for our rights is a struggle for the community. But being narrow-minded, we do not realize that a gain to the community is a gain to us. If we consider this thing closely, we shall realize that Indians lost money at the time of the Jameson Raidlibtech_292_footnoteand the same thing happened during the War.libtech_293_footnoteBut we gave no thought to it because we were helpless. Shall we give up fighting for the good of the community, apprehensive that perhaps there may be some loss of money ?
 WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH COPIES OF THIS JOURNAL AFTER
 READING THEM?
 I have been asked to answer this question also. My advice at any rate is that the Opinion is so important that everyone should maintain  a file of its issues. But those who are not particular about maintaining a file or feel too lazy to do so should immediately after reading an issue post it to a friend in India. It is necessary to do this; for, it is the easiest and cheapest way to publicise in India the facts of our struggle here.
 CONTENTS OF AFFIDAVITS
 Affidavits are being obtained from those “brave” ones who now go to the Permit Office at Pretoria to “play on the piano” [i.e., to give finger-prints]. The substance of the affidavit has come to my hand. It includes the following words: “Owing to the  attitude instigated by Mr. M. K. Gandhi and taken up by the Asiatics, I was afraid to present myself at the Permit Office in Pretoria during the month of July. I therefore request now that I may be registered.” One cannot understand how any Indian could have the face to put his signature to a document of this kind. One cannot know even what the Permit Office gains thereby. Be that as it may, has the fear of the person concerned disappeared now? Mr. Gandhi’s advice even today is the same, and he says it will remain the same till his death. The Indian community also stands unshaken in its resolve. But why argue with a person bent on taking out the title-deed of slavery?
 MONSTER PETITION
 A copy of the monster petitionlibtech_294_footnoteand  a  set  of   instructions  are being sent herewith. The petition must be dispatched quite soon, so that the affidavits in question may lose all their force. Those who have
 
 not got copies of the petition for their signature should obtain them from theSecretary. I may here mention an earlier instance that occurs to me. When the Franchise Bill was introduced in Natal in 1894, a petition  signed  by  10,000  Indians  was  sent   to   Lord   Ripon,libtech_295_footnoteand consequently the Bill was dropped. That is one thing to be remembered. Another thing is that leading men came forward  to obtain the signatures, which were secured within 15 days. It was later found that signatures in duplicate were necessary. Accordingly, 30 volunteers worked for a whole night and prepared a copy. The Natal struggle was nothing compared to the present one. To obtain signatures on this petition, we certainly need the energetic support of leading men and, also, volunteers. I think it will be of advantage if copies of the petition with signatures reach here before the 30th. I earnestly hope that at least 10,000 Indians will sign the petition.
 At the meeting of the Association convened to  consider  the Hon. Prof. Gokhale’s cablegram, it was also resolved to send out to all towns the monster petition for signature. In addition to the Chairman, Mr. Coovadia, Mr. Cama, Mr. Fancy, Mr. Emam Abdool Cadir and Mr. Shah addressed the meeting.
 LETTER FROM WELL-KNOWN ENGLISHWOMAN
 There is a well-known ladylibtech_296_footnoteconnected with the Ethical Society of England who writes as follows:
 I have just been reading Indian Opinion for July 27th and I can forbear no longer sending to you a few words to express sympathy with you, which I have felt over and over again when reading your paper—sympathy with the stress and strain of your struggle, sympathy with the holy nature of your cause, and, above all, sympathy with the spirit in which you are writing, speaking and acting all the time. I want to send you congratulations also in that you have been able to carry on the struggle so strenuously.
 FORGOTTEN VOLUNTEER
 Mr. Mohamed Ismail Kanmia writes that, though he had given his name to the Hamidia Society, it did not appear in the Indian Opinion. He feels sorry about it. It is for the Editor or the reporter to say how this name came to be omitted. When everyone is working under great stress, such an omission should be excused. However, Mr. Mahomed Ismail deserves praise for his vigilance. I hope others too will show similar zeal. Let all Indians remember that the worth of their enthusiasm will be tested when the time for action comes.

176,"September 21, 1907",LETTER TO PRIME MINISTER’S SECRETARY,"
    
 JOHANNESBURG,
 September 21, 1907
THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO
 THE RIGHT HON’BLE THE PRIME MINISTER PRETORIA
SIR,
 The Committee of my Association desires me to draw the Prime Minister’s attention to the following report in the papers:
 He regretted that Asiatics were objecting to registration on such a flimsy excuse as that of the taking of finger impressions. It was enforced for white people, and he did not see that anyone suffered from the rule.
 If the report referred to is correct, I venture to draw the Right Hon’ble gentleman’s attention to the fact that finger impressions themselves have never been a primary cause of the opposition to the Registration Act. While they undoubtedly constitute a serious item among many others, my Association is free to admit that, by themselves, they would never justify the very great and  intense irritation that the Act has caused. I take the liberty to quote from the grounds of objections framed:
  It 	is manifestly in 	conflict with 	the past declarations of 	His Majesty’s representatives;  It 	recognises no 	distinction between 	British and alien 	Asiatics;  It 	reduces British Indians 	to a 	status lower 	than that of the 	aboriginal races of 	South Africa and 	coloured people;  It 	renders the 	position of 	British Indians in 	the Transvaal 	much worse 	than under 	Law 3 	of 1885, 	and therefore, 	than under 	the Boer regime;  It 	sets up 	a system of 	passes and 	espionage unknown in 	any other 	British territory;  It 	brands the 	communities to 	which it is  applied as criminals or suspects;  The 	alleged influx 	of unauthorised 	British Indians 	 is denied;  If 	such a 	denial is 	not accepted, a 	judicial, open, and 	British inquiry 	should be 	instituted before such 	drastic  and 	uncalled for 	legislation is enforced; 
 
  The 	measure is 	otherwise un-British, 	and unduly 	restricts the 	liberty of 	inoffensive British 	subjects, and 	constitutes a 	compulsory invitation to 	British Indians in 	the Transvaal 	to leave 	the country. 
 Thus, it will be seen that, when the Law was first introduced last year, the main objections did not contain even so much as a reference to finger prints. The whole flavour about the Act is, in my humble opinion, that of criminality, and submission to it would make the lives of British Indians in the Transvaal intolerable.
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servant,
 ESSOP ISMAIL MIA, CHAIRMAN,

          [JOHANNESBURG, 
   [J. 	A. NESER, ESQ., M. L. A.  P. O. BOX 22 	KLERKSDORP] September 	24, 1907] 
   DEAR 	SIR,  	You are reported to have made the following observations regarding 	the Asiatic Act:  The 	Law, said Mr. Neser, 	regarding Asiatics was 	highly necessary. 	He could 	not understand 	the objections 	raised by the Indians 	with regard to the 	taking of 	fingerprints, in 	which there was 	nothing degrading 	whatever, and the 	only reason he 	could see 	was that the 	Indians were endeavouring 	to shield 	those of their 	fraternity who had come 	and were still coming 	into  the 	Transvaal in 	an illegal way.  	My Association regrets that you have not taken the trouble to 	understand the objections of the Indian community to the Asiatic 	Act.  I beg to invite your attention to the letter addressed by my 	Association to General Botha,libtech_297_footnotelibtech_298_footnoteand 	to add that, in the opinion of my Association,    
 the Act not only wounds every manly sentiment but it insults the great religions of India.
 My Association is surprised that you should consider it fit to charge the community represented by my Association with a desire to shield those who have entered the Colony illegally. I am sure you do not consider that British Indians are ready to sacrifice all that they hold dear forthe sake of covering the guilty. Moreover, the fact that British Indians have accepted the principle of voluntary registration shows that it is not possible for the Indian community to screen offenders.

178,"September 	25, 1907",JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
         [September 	25, 1907]  	“PLAGUE 	OFFICE’ 	ON TOUR  	The Permit Office—I forget, it should be “Plague Office”— 	went round Boksburg, but obtained no other prey than an Indian 	prisoner. The reporters of the Leader and the [Rand] 	Daily Mail state that the morale of the Indians there was 	very high. Their pickets were firm and appealed to every Indian who 	wished to go to the Permit Office. Some Indians had reached as far 	as the Office, but when they saw what was in store for them, they 	returned without surrendering their honour. By the time this letter 	appears in print, the Office will also have moved to Germiston. 	There is not the slightest probability of any Indian applying for a 	permit there.  HAMIDIA 	MEETING  	As days pass, the time draws near for the “Plague” to visit 	Johannesburg. The Hamidia Islamic Society therefore held a large 	meeting on Sunday. The hall was packed to the full. Mr. Emam Abdool 	Cadir took the chair. Mr. Gandhi  read  out  the  cablegramlibtech_299_footnotereceived  from  Babu  Surendranath  Banerjealibtech_300_footnoteand  explained  the     
 situation. [He said that] signatures on the monster petition should be obtained with the utmost speed. For this purpose, volunteers should be enlisted. The volunteers appointed to picket the Permit Office should do their work with great care and patience. It will not be proper. for them to shout at anyone or handle anyone roughly. Then Mr. Essop Mia gave an account of the interview he had with Mr. Gibson, and said that they were not to depend at all on his advice or on that of other whites. In an impassioned speech, Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar quoted versesfrom the Koran, which said that the faithful should not put their trust in God’s enemies or in their own. At the present time, the whites were playing the part of enemies and they should not be trusted when they advised them to get registered, etc. Further, he said that a person like the Prophet Moses along with his community of 1,00,000 men had to undergo hardships for 12 years. Only then did happiness come to him. Similarly, the Indian community would have happiness only after it passed through suffering. Moreover, the Prophet Moses led an attack on Pharaoh relying on God alone. Likewise, the Indian community was to stick to its pledge with faith in God. What if one had to lose all one’s wealth for the sake of one’s name, reputation and faith? Then the Chairman addressed the meeting and said that, just now as they were receiving encouraging cablegrams from such great men as Prof. Gokhale and Babu Surendranath Banerjea in India, so would they slave to face the indignation of the whole of India if they threw up the game at the critical moment. It was also stated at the meeting that the Muslim subjects of Turkey in the Transvaal  were  thinking  of  sending  a  petition.   Mr.  Nawab  Khanlibtech_301_footnotespoke about volunteers. Mr. Patel from Klerksdorp, who was present, gave the assurance that signatures from his place would be obtained in time. Mr. Aswat pointed out that the month of Ramzan would coincide with the month for permits. It should not therefore  be allowed to happen that Muslims observed the holy fast on the one hand and forsook their faith on the other by blackening their hands and faces.
 GOVERNMENT’S KEENNESS
 The Government appears very keen on getting the Indian community to register itself. This is a matter of concern to us; at the same time, it should give us courage. We should be concerned because we are not to do what the Government is so keen that we should; it should give us courage because the Government’s keenness also reveals its fear. However hard of heart it may be, it is improbable that
 
 it will deport all Indians or deprive them of their licences. Mr. Saleji sends a copy of the letter the Government has addressed to the magistrate at Belfast. It shows that the magistrates have been asked to inform every Indian that those who have not registered themselves so far can go to Johannesburg in October and take out their title-deed of slavery there. What can be more indicative of fear than this?
 GENERAL BOTHA’S MISUNDERSTANDING
 General Botha says that the Indian community is not being reasonable in carrying on so much agitation against finger-prints. This also shows that the Government itself does not know what it will do if the Indians remain firm. However, to remove the wrong impres-sion, Mr. Essop Mia has addressed the following letter on behalf of the Association: libtech_302_footnote
 BABU SURENDRANATH’S CABLEGRAM
 The following is the cablegram sent by Babu Surendranath Banerjea from Calcutta:
 Bengal’s warmest sympathy your trials, struggles. Wish success.
 This cablegram has caused great joy. Babu Surendranath is adored by Bengali students. For the last 25 years, he has been fighting the battle of Indians. He was probably the first Indian to enter the I. C.
 S. He is the head of the Ripon College and proprietor of the famous journal, Bengalee. For many years, he has been the Secretary of the British Indian Association, Calcutta. He presided over the sessions of the Indian National Congress at Poona and Ahmedabad. There are very few orators of his ability in India. He has a voice so powerful that in an assembly of 10,000 men it can be heard even at the farthest end. He has played a big part in the Swadeshi movement. It can be taken as a very good omen that such cablegrams have started coming from India.
 FLOCK OF BLACK SHEEP
 The number of black sheep continues to increase slowly. Messrs
 . . . libtech_303_footnotehave received the consecration. These men, I think, ought to dress themselves like women.
 STOKEINSTROOM
 Speaking at Heidelberg, Mr. Stokeinstroom said that no licences would be issued to Indians if they did not register themselves. The mask has now been torn off. At first they talked of gaol sentences.
 
 Gaol gave place to deportation. Now they are talking of licences. What will Mr. Botha do when the Indian community gives up the fear of losing their licences?
 NESER
 Mr. Neser spoke at Klerksdorp in the same strain as Mr. Stok- einstroom. Denouncing the fight against finger-prints, he said that the Indian community was fighting to shield men who had immigrated illegally. He added that, if the community went on fighting, the Government would stop issuing trade licences. We are unconcerned at the threat. For, knowing that barking dogs seldom bite, the Indian community grows the more fearless the more it is threatened. But we should give some thought to the ignorance of men like Mr. Neser, for somehow the misunderstanding still persists that we have been fighting only against finger-prints. Mr. Essop Mia has therefore sent the follo- wing reply. After quoting Mr. Neser’s speech, Mr. Essop Mia says:libtech_304_footnote
 WILLEM VAN HULSTEYN
 In a speech, Sir Willem Van Hulsteyn had said that the Indians were fighting only against finger-prints. Drawing the attention of the gentleman to this, the Secretary of the British Indian Association has written to this effect:libtech_305_footnote
 The Indian fight is against the whole of the law, and not merely against the finger-prints. Indians believe that acceptance of the law under compulsion will amount to slavery. They are, therefore, prepared to lose their all rather than have slavery; it is not merely a question of not giving finger-prints. We are quite aware of the penalties with which the Government has begun threatening us. It is still to be seen whether a rigorous enforcement of the law will redound to the credit of the Government, or the credit will be due  to  the Indians for undergoing unmerited suffering.
 A CORRECTION
 With reference to my comment on the “brave ones”  of Pietersburg, a prominent gentleman from the place says that the well-known Pietersburg application did not contain the signatures of the persons named by me. For they were out of station at the time. I am sorry for the mistake made by me. However, it is not possible to excuse the fault of the gentlemen who have blackened their hands.
 
   1907     
 Only, the fault is not so big as it seemed. I may be permitted to infer from the said letter that those who have signed the application will never touch the title-deed of slavery.
 BATTLE AT GERMISTON
 The Permit Office has encamped at Germiston.  The  Indians there have therefore become excited. Till today (Wednesday) they have stayed away from business and have started working as volunte- ers. Not one man from Germiston has applied. Even the hotel waiters have refused to apply. Only one Madrasi from Pretoria, named Cas- sim, disregarded the advice of the pickets and registered himself. Five Memons went there, but allowed themselves to be dissuaded by the pickets and gave up the idea of playing on the piano [i. e., of registe- ring themselves]. The enthusiasm of the volunteers at Germiston being excessive, it was necessary to restrain them. Now, only as many as are required there work there and, that too, with courtesy and patience.

180,,INDIA’S HELP,"
    
 The Hon’ble Professor Gokhale has been quickly followed by the Hon’ble Surendranath Banerjea in sympathising with Indians in the Transvaal in their death struggle. It is no small thing to receive cables from these trusted representatives of the people of India. Both of them have dedicated their lives to the Indian cause, and both command unrivalled influence in India. It is, therefore, reasonable to suppose that the Indian question in the Transvaal will soon occupy a most prominent place in Indian politics. Lord Ampthill truly said the other day that nothing has wounded so deeply Indian sentiment as the
 
 grievances of British Indians in South Africa. We need the encourage- ment received from India. On this question, there are no parties in India, there is no division of opinion, all—Hindu, Mahomedan, Parsee and Christian—alike realise the very painful and humiliating position occupied by Indians in the Transvaal. Anglo-Indian opinion is just as solid as Indian opinion; no one has spoken so strongly against the treatment as The Englishman in Calcutta and The Times of India in Bombay. All, therefore, that is needed is to focus the energy of the different associationsand organs of opinion in India, and to bring the weight of this solid influence to bear on Lord Minto; then the Indian question cannot but be solved in accordance with principles of justice and humanity.

181,,PICKETS DUTY,"
    
 Johannesburg Indians will soon be put upon their mettle, and there can be little doubt that the ultimate course of action as to the Asiatic Act will be largely determined by the result of the attempt of the Registration Office to register Asiatics in Johannesburg. Johannesburg contains nearly one-half of the Asiatic population of the Transvaal—all the different Asiatic races, too, are largely represented on the Rand—and, if they remain firm in their opposition to the Asiatic Act, it must give the local Government some food for serious reflection. The building of a jail, no matter what threats may be held out, is not a joke in these times when the money-market is so tight. Deportation of thousands of inoffensive people is not a matter of practical politics, because it is likely to appal the conscience of even Generals Botha and Smuts. We have, therefore, arrived at threats as to the stopping of Asiatic licences, but, were such a thing possible, the Government will be stultifying themselves in that they will have left the largest number of Asiatics untouched. Whatever action, therefore, the Johannesburg Asiatics take will very largely decide the issue. The responsibility, therefore, on the shoulders of leading Indians and other leading Asiatics in Johannesburg is very grave and very great.
 There is no denying the fact that, hitherto, the boycott of the Registration Office has been so successful, because of the work of the Indian pickets or missionaries. They have done their work calmly, deliberately and unobtrusively. There are many disturbing elements in Johannesburg. Those who have volunteered to do the missionary work are, some of them, fiery spirits. Indians in Johannesburg, too,  are  drawn from all classes. We, therefore, warn the Indian volunteers against any haste or any display of ill temper. Physical violence must
 be absolutely eschewed, and so must strong language. Those who are anxious to avoid the yoke of the Asiatic Act should  be  equally anxious not to put a more terrible yoke in the shape of ignorant brow-beating and intimidation. If Indians are satisfied that the Act imposes degradation on them and takes away their manliness, all that they need do is to place that view before those who do not know it. Once they have done so, their duty is finished, and they should leave itopen to the would-be applicant for registration to make his choice. It is his loss, not the community’s, if he elects to accept the enslaving conditions of the Act.

182,,GENERAL B0THA AND THE ASIATIC ACT,"
    
 It is disconcerting to find that the Premier of the Transvaal, who had no hesitation in speaking sweetly and softly to the deputation that waited on him at the Hotel Cecil during his memorable visit to  London, does not know even up to now what the real struggle of the Asiatics hinges on. He thinks, and rightly so, that there can be no excuse for the tremendous agitation carried on by the Asiatics of the Transvaal, over the question of finger-prints merely, but the belief of General Botha that the agitation is based on the objection to finger-prints only shows how helplessly ignorant he is as to the Indian attitude. The British Indian Association has promptly forwarded to General Botha some of the objectionslibtech_307_footnotethat were framed against the Act when it was first mooted in 1906. The gallant General has not even taken the trouble to ascertain whether it was at all possible for the British Indians of the Transvaal to engage world-wide sympathy, if their objections were confined to the giving of digit-impressions. It may be convenient for the statesmen of the Transvaal to disregard the very serious points raised by the Indian community  as  to  their religious feelings, their status, and degrading class-legislation, but such habitual disregard can only end in more intense irritation and in stiffening the backs of the Asiatics. Theirs is now the courage of desperation. They have accustomed themselves to the idea of their all being taken away from them. It would, therefore, be wise and prudent if the Transvaal Government were, at least, to examine the Indian objections on their merits, and not shut their eyes against them.

  "
183,,THE BATTLE AGAINST INDIAN HAWKERS,"
    
 The debate in the Legislative Assembly of Natal on the proposal to raise the licence fee payable by hawkers is very enlightening. No one minded the exorbitant increase in the fee payable by the Natal hawker, because hawking is largely in the hands of Asiatics, and because, as the Minister of Justice put it, “Hawking was not a fit pursuit for white men in this country.” Quite on a par with  this method of dealing with questions affecting non-whites is the proposal made by that arch anti-Asiatic, Mr. Haggar, that “it is in the public interest undesirable to employ Asiatics on the  N.G.R.libtech_308_footnotelibtech_309_footnotein  positions usually filled by white men”. Strictly speaking, the great M.L.A. should have said “in the white interest”, instead of “in the public interest”. The motion, let it be said, was accepted by the Minister of Railways and Harbours and he said that, if he could not kick out “coolies”, as he described Indian pointsmen, it was because he had a mandate about retrenchment from the members of the House. In both these cases, therefore, there was not even so much as an examination of the claims that Indian hawkers and Indian pointsmen might presu- mably have. The “British subjects” theory has evidently been played out so far as the Colonies are concerned—they will have all the adva- ntages that their association with the ancient flag may secure to them, but they will have none of the inconveniences or the responsibilities that the bearers of the flag must necessarily carry with it.

184,,OUR SUPPLEMENT,"
    
 We are publishing along with this issue a photograph of the brave volunteers of Pretoria. Out of deference to the views of some gentlemen, we did not so far issue the supplement. But in doing so, we believe, we have been unjust to some extent to the pickets at Pretoria. We are definitely of opinion that had these volunteers not come forward and set an example of patience, gentleness and courage, the fight would not have progressed so far.
 Now it is the turn of Johannesburg. We take it to be our duty to issue the supplement on this occasion. If Johannesburg follows
 
 theexample of these young men and deals with people with patience and humility, we shall believe that the end of our struggle is drawing near.

 "
185,,DUTY OF VOLUNTEERS,"
    
 We saw during the Transvaal struggle that excellent work was done by the “volunteers” or “pickets” or “missionaries” or “watchmen”, or whatever other name is used for them. Without their help, nothing could have been achieved. The real credit for the  struggle goes to the “pickets” in Pretoria. The example that they set by their patience, gentleness and courage is being  followed  everywhere else.
 There is a problem only in Johannesburg. There are Indians of every sort living in this town. Among them there may even be some who have no sense of shame. It should not be surprising if such persons prepare themselves to apply for  registration.  Moreover, people from outside may also go there with the same disgraceful aim. How should “the pickets” manage all such persons? Ordinarily, we shall feel contempt for any Indian seeking to soil his hands. But it will be better to show pity rather than contempt.
 A watchman’s duty is to watch, not to assault. We have not the slightest hesitation in saying that if anyone in Johannesburg seeking registration is assaulted, our success will turn into failure just at the last moment, like a ship sinking when about to reach the harbour. Our whole struggle is based on our submitting ourselves to hardships, not inflicting them on anyone else, be he an Indian or European. This point must be borne in mind very carefully by every “watchman”. Our duty is to reason with those who are doing wrong, to entreat them, to beg of them. If in spite of this they wish to court slavery, they ought to have the freedom to do so. For, we do not see any gain in saving them from the yoke of the law in order to subject them to our own yoke. It is our duty to extend to others the same freedom that we want for ourselves.

186,,IS INDIA AROUSED?libtech_310_footnote,"
    
 The cables from the Hon’ble Prof. Gokhale and the Hon’ble Babu Surendranath Banerjea have proved very inspiring to us. These gentlemen are not likely to remain content with merely sending messages of sympathy. Their cables indicate that we shall get full support from India. This can have a very important meaning. The Transvaal question will not be treated as a small matter. It will receive world-wide publicity. We have now reason to believe that urgent representations will be made from India and meetings will be held there that case, the Imperial Government can no longer remain indifferent. Lord Ampthill has already said that no other question has hurt the feelings of Indians as much as the Transvaal question his. Trouble is brewing everywhere. At such a time, how can the [Imperial] Government permit such a potent cause for discontent in India?
 There is only one reason why we have won such support and that is our courage. The strength that we have displayed so far by our unity has had a powerful effect. We have won great honour. It is in the hands of the Transvaal Indians to preserve it. And the eyes of the Transvaal Indians are on Johannesburg.

187,,“THE CRUSHING OF TREES”,"
    
 We have a proverb in Gujarati that, when mighty bulls fight, trees get uprooted. Two parties of whites in Natal have been wrangling, and the poor Indian labourers bear the consequences. Mr. Haggar and his friends say that, in place of the Indian watchmen at railway crossings, whites should be appointed, and the former discharged. There is no reason to believe that in making such a move Mr. Haggar is actuated by a particularly benevolent motive. His intention is only somehow to attract public notice. The Natal Government is aware that it will be improper to engage highly-paid whites and kick Indians out of their jobs. But the Government is shy of showing such honesty publicly. Hence it says that Indian workers
 
 will be relieved wherever possible. Neither party cares for the consequences of carrying out this intention. They call this “civilization” If this is what education and culture mean, we wish Indians will save themselves from this spectre.

188,,MOVEMENT FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT IN EGYPT,"
    
 A letter in the Rand Daily Mail shows that the movement for self-government in Egypt has suddenly assumed importance. It is said to  be  the   effect   of   Mustafa   Kemal   Pasha’slibtech_311_footnoteactivities.  There   are members of the aristocracy on the Egyptian Council, of whom about 116 are reported to have resolved to demand self-government. They say that they do not reject British help. But they wish to take the reins of Government into their own hands. They desire that the Department of Public Education should be entirely in  the  people’s charge. Mustafa Kemal Pasha asserts that, if the British Government does not grant this peacefully and in a friendly manner, the people of Egypt will rather get it by fighting than let Egypt remain a dependent State.

189,"September 	28, 1907",LETTER TO J. A NESER,"
          [JOHANNESBURG,] 
   J. 	A. NESER, 	ESQ., 	M.L.A.  P. O. BOX 	22 KLERKSDORP 	SIR, September 	28, 1907 
  	I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 	27th instant, and to tender to you the thanks of my Association for 	your very courteous, frank and full letter. The greatest stumbling- 	block in the way of a proper solution of the Indian question has 	been, undoubtedly, a great deal of apathy on the part of public men 	and consequent want of knowledge about the question.    Egypt 
 I am deeply thankful for the sympathy you express for my countrymen who have vested interests in this Colony, and it is because the fight is entirely for the protection of such interests that I see in your attitude a common meeting-ground.
 Not only does my Association sympathise with the objection to wholesale immigration from India, but it has recognised its validity, in view of the very general prejudice against such immigration, and has always offered to co-operate with the Government in attaining the object.
 The ground is now clear for an examination of the Asiatic Act on its merits. I venture to draw your attention to the fact that, when, in the September of 1906, objections against the draft Ordinance, as the Act then was, were framed, finger-prints were not even so much as mentioned, although it was understood that the Government intended to insist on finger-prints. The attitude of my Association would not, therefore, have been in any way altered, had signature been substituted for finger-prints. It is the sting of compulsion running throughout the Act that offends and bears so heavily on the community. The finger-prints do not offend any religious susceptibility but the exception made in the Act in favour of Turkish Christians. Turkish Jews does most emphatically wound religious feelings.
 The Act bristles with severe penalties for breaches of the requirements thereof, but it is not the fact of the penalty that is  resented, but the underlying assumption that Johannesburg as a class, are capable of impersonation, fraudulent transfers of permits, and fraudulently bringing unauthorised immigrants into the country that is most strongly and, I think, rightly objected to. Whenever in a  country exceptional penalties are provided for a particular offence, the general existence of such an offence in that country is, as you are aware, presumed. Knowing well that British Indians, as a class, have not been guilty of the practices above described, they manfully struggle to avoid the presumption which the Act has made tacitly and which the framers of the Law publicly declare as their conviction. It should, moreover, be borne in mind that this Law is a class measure of an obnoxious type, and is calculated to degrade British Indians in the estimation of Malays, with whom many of them are nearly related, Cape Coloured men, with whom they come in close contact, and the Kaffir races, who are largely employed by them as their servants. While all these three are, in common with the other inhabitants of the Colony, exempt from any such restrictions on their personal liberty, Asiatics have been especially singled out.
 The obvious answer to the last objection is, naturally, that it is the competition of the Asiatics that is feared and not that of the Coloured races, and it is because my Association recognises this that voluntary identification or registration has been suggested in place of the compulsory measure. Such voluntary registration will not insult Indians by separating them from the rest of  the  community,  will satisfy the European objection wholly, and will protect vested rights. You seem to think that voluntary registration will leave untouched dishonest Indians, whose existence I do not deny, but that is, I beg to state, a mistake. Under the voluntary offer, it has been submitted to the Government that by a short Bill, passed by consent, the Act can be made applicable to those who do not comply with the offer. Indeed, at a stated period, all Indians or Asiatics may be examined simultane- ously, and those who are found to be without the new identification certificates may be bundled out of the Colony under the Peace Preservation Ordinance or under a General Immigration Law that may be passed, in the place of the Peace Preservation Ordinance.
 I will not trespass further upon your time, but will conclude by saying that, while my countrymen have honestly endeavoured to examine and meet reasonable objections raised by Europeans, the latter have, as a body, entirely failed to reciprocate, but have simply persevered in their policy of prejudiced opposition without caring to examine the Indian position. As you have been, in your professional capacity, very largely connected with British Indians, I may not be wrong in asking you to step into our shoes and look at the whole position from our standpoint, and see whether a reasonable compro- mise is not possible by the exercise of a little patience and some co- operation.
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servant, ESSOP ISMAIL MIA CHAIRMAN,

            TO THE 	EDITOR       [GERMISTON,]  September 	28, [1907] 
 [RAND 	DAILY MAIL JOHANNESBURG] SIR,  	The Reporter has  informed  the  public  that  in  Germiston  it was 	the intimidation of British Indian pickets that many Indians 	refrained from registering themselves. I, as chief picket, beg 	tostate that the information given to you is absolutely  incorrect.  	I  may inform you that, as a matter of fact, for two days the whole 	Indian population of Germiston was picketing because they all 	stopped work. Such was their enthusiasm and opposition to the law. 	It was only after the appointed pickets persuaded the other Indians 	that they recommenced their work.  	But it is quite true that some of the Indians from different other 	places came to Germiston to get registered, and they listened to the 	expostulations and arguments advanced by the Germiston pickets and 	returned without compromising themselves or their community. But, 	where such reasonable argument failed, strict instructions were 	given that those who wished to accept the slavery imposed by the law 	should be personally escorted, and this was done in the instance of 	an Indian named Joseph Bahadur who came from Boksburg.  	In our fight we do not need intimidation. Those who understand the 	Act and all the consequences of it refrain, except when they are 	blinded to a sense of their own dignity by their selfishness, of 	their own accord from accepting the yoke. I may state for the 	information of your numerous readers that even hospital attendants 	and labourers refused to register themselves under threat of being 	dismissed from their employment, and their dignified refusal had 	such marked effect on their employers that the threats were 	withdrawn.

 JOHANNESBURG,
 [September 29, 1907]
 I am attending the Society’s meeting today, but I have nothing special to say. A letter has been received from Mr. Beg. He has offered help as a picket, if necessary. Indians of Johannesburg must take a lesson from the courage shown by their brethren in Germiston. Mr. Ram Sundar Pundit will tell you about it. The pickets here have to perform their duty carefully. We must reason with the people to the best of our ability. No force should be used against anyone. If any persons come from outside, we should be patient in dealing with them.
 About the application submitted from Pretoria, I have so far learnt that the Government will appoint inspectors to examine the permits. Mr. Cody has held out a threat that the people will have to leave theTransvaal, but Mr. Pundit is very firm. It would be good if they arrested Mr. Pundit himself. It is necessary to expedite the taking of signatures in Johannesburg.

 Mr. Subhan Godfrey and Mrs. Godfrey have further reason for congratulation in the return of their third son from England after having received a liberal education.

Mr.  George  Godfreylibtech_314_footnotelibtech_315_footnote,  too,  may well congratulate himself upon his safe return after completing his studies without a break and his reception by his friends and fellow-countrymen, but we are not in the mood to exaggerate the possession of educational qualifications.

194,,POOR BUT BRAVE 1NDIANS,"
    
 There are some poor Indians who were prepared to give up their jobs and become beggars rather than submit to the obnoxious law. We have mentioned this fact in our Germiston report. Just because these men who defied the law are poor, people do not run to embrace them. But we call these poor men heroes among men. For, if we succeed on the question of this law, much of the credit will go to such poor people. We ask those among the merchants who are getting nervous to remember that it is because of trade jealousy that the whole Indian community has to suffer. It is they especially who ought to feel
 
 humiliated by the law. It, therefore, behoves them to keep their pledge for the sake of the country, if not for their own prestige.
 The question is being repeatedly asked as to what the merchants are to do without licences. But what will happen to Indians who lose their jobs is a more dreadful thing to contemplate. It is important, in our view, that they should be saved. However, we must say that it is far better for people in service to lose their jobs and starve than to submit to the law.

195,,INDIAN VOTERS,"
    
 We give in this issue a letter from an Indian contributor who signs himself “Voter”. The question raised by “Voter” appears reasonable on a superficial view. The argument that the members of the municipality would not have deprived Indians of their licences if Indians had a vote in Ladysmith or Durban is valid only under one condition. That is that, in using their franchise, Indians should prove themselves the equal of whites. We must say that the Indians  are  unable to do so, because they lack the urge for freedom. There are many Indian voters in the Cape, but they have not used their power properly. Our readerswill remember that even in a city like Bombay there was the farce of a caucus. What, then, can we expect in Natal? We are convinced that as long as Indians have not imbibed true western education, they will not have any such spirit and that the franchise will not be a useful weapon to them till then. This is not to say that we should allow ourselves to be deprived of the right to vote. We have put up a strong fight against the move to deprive us of the franchise, and will continue to do so in future. But we also know that the use of the franchise carries with it some risk. However, if it is preserved, we may be able to use it when occasion requires. The weapon had  better remain sheathed for the present. But the easiest and best step against the licence trouble in Ladysmith is to carry on trade without a licence. Till the people get that much spirit, we think it is pointless to talk of voting rights.

 The Association in the Cape under Mr. Nuruddin’s presiden- tship appears  to  be  growing  stronger.  An  accountlibtech_316_footnoteof  its  meeting published elsewhere is worth reading. If public work were to be done with the same spirit with which this Association is run, it would work wonders. This is the time not to enjoy authority but to render public service. The leaders must never lose sight of this. Then only will the fire raging round us be extinguished.
 In the Cape there are two organizations in the same place—the League and the Association. We observe that there is some unhealthy rivalry between the two. It is our advice to both that they ought to work together.
 We remind the Association that it has still not done its duty by the Committee in London. The Cape was expected to contribute £50, but the sum has not yet been received. The Committee has been doing excellent work. But, then, work of any kind is bound to involve proportionate expenditure. It is the duty of all Indians in South Africa to help meet that expenditure. We hope the Association will take up this work.

197,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 GENERAL BOTHA’S BIRTHDAY
 On the occasion of General Botha’s birthday on Friday last, the Association and the Hamidia Islamic Society sent him greetings by telegram. The whites gave him rich presents. It was a sign of courtesy on the part of the Indian community to have sent the telegrams. They prove that, irrespective of whether General Botha does or does not attend to our representations, we do not forget our good manners.
 HAMIDIA SOCIETY’S MEETING
 As usual, a meeting of this Society took place on Sunday last. The hall was fully packed. If our struggle against the law comes off successfully, the credit for that will go largely to the Society. No one should be alarmed because I use the word “if”. I use it because, generally, doubts are felt whether in this big fight the Indian
 
 community will remain united to the end and disobey the law. For, this is a new kind of step for us in the present age. There is a deep-rooted superstition that a law cannot be disobeyed. It would be no small step forward for the community if this superstition were rooted out. When we shall have resisted the law to the last, we shall be regarded as so many Thoreaus in miniature. By this time the readers of the Opinion must be aware of who Thoreau was.
 Let us return to the meeting. Mr. Emam Abdool Cadir took the chair. Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar made a powerful speech,  reciting forceful verses applicable to all Indians. Then Mr.  Ram  Sundar Pundit spoke, giving an account of the struggle in Germiston. He said that his permit was expiring on the 30th, but he had, as desired by the people, agreed to stay on. Even if the Government did not extend his permit, he would stay on and go to gaol. He would not swerve from his duty. He also added that the Germiston pickets were prepared to help at Johannesburg. Mr. Gandhi stated that there was a letter from Mr. Beg of Pretoria, offering assistance of pickets. Mr. Omarji Sale vehemently asserted that there should be no yielding to the new law, no matter what the cost. Mr. Ebrahim Coovadia read out from the  Gujaratilibtech_317_footnotelibtech_318_footnotean article on the subject of the new law. Mr. Val- labhbhai said that from among the Kanabislibtech_319_footnotelibtech_320_footnoteno  Hindu   would  turn back, and that most of the Hindus had put their signatures to the petition. Mr. Nawab Khan also spoke. The Chairman expressed thanks for the offers made by Messrs Beg andRam Sundar Pundit, and also for the enthusiasm shown by the latter. An appeal was made to the leaders to complete the work of obtaining signatures on the [monster] petition; the meeting then terminated.
 CHINESE MEETING
 A meeting of the Chinese Association also took place the same Sunday. There, too, the hall was fully packed. Mr. Quinn took the chair. Mr. Gandhi explained the position to date in regard to the law, and the Chinese expressed firm resolve not to submit to the law.
 CASE UNDER NEW LAW
 A Madrasi named Illumuthu had applied for the title-deed of slavery under the new law. As his application was not in order, the Registrar, as required by the law, has exhibited a notice at the Magis- trate’s Court in Pretoria to the effect that the new register would not be issued to the applicant and that he should appear before the Magi- strate to submit his statement. The timid among us should note to what
 
 
 plight applicants for new registers might be reduced.
 ‘BOYCOTT INDIANS’
 The Women’s Association at Pretoria is raising such a cry. These women have passed a resolution to the effect “that  the  delegates  would once more’ ask the members of the Branch to support white traders as against Indians”. It is such movements that we should really fear rather than the new law. If the whites discontinue dealings with Indians, the latter will have to quit even without a law. There is only one way of preventing this from happening, and that is for the Indians to be industrious and to maintain perfect honesty. I even go so far as to say that women who have been pleased with the courage we are now showing will continue to buy [from us]. If we prove cowards, however, even they will look down on us and drive us out. This will be  confirmed by those hawkers who might have had experience of this.
 INDIANS WHO HAVE RETURNED FROM KOMATIPOORT
 Mr. Chamney has sent the following reply to the letterlibtech_321_footnoteaddres- sed to him in regard to these four Indians:
 The four Indians in question, Mahomed Ebrahim, Moosa Kara, Kara Vally and Issa Asmail, were stopped because they had entered [the Transvaal] from Portuguese territory. They were not allowed to proceed to Delagoa Bay because they were not in possession of steamer tickets. Since they knew of no place where they could reside while their case was being investigated, they were permitted to make use of oneof the police cells. The action was taken solely in their interests. These men had no right to enter the Transvaal. They must leave, therefore, otherwise they will be prosecuted.
 The four “heroes” have bought tickets for Durban and are not likely to trouble Mr. Chamney. It is needless  to  offer  further comment.
 TURKISH SUBJECTS

 The report of my speech referred to by you is [substantially]libtech_323_footnotecorrect and I adhere to every word I said on the subject. I feel considerable sympathy with Asiatic people who have legitimately obtained vested interests in this country. I have fought their cause before in the Courts here and I am prepared to continue fighting it in future on every possible occasion, but I am not prepared to allow further Asiatic immigration [into the Transvaal if I can prevent it] and I am quite determined to assist in every possible way to obstruct and render such immigration impossible. It is only a matter of self-preservation and nothing else. [For the life of me] I cannot understand what objection any man can have to finger-prints. [It is certainly the safest way of identifying anybody and] I, personally, would have no objection to be so identified. In what respect fingerprints could wound the religious susceptibilities of any person I fail to understand. You make a good deal of voluntary registration. Now what is the difference between voluntary and compulsory registration? Will you be good enough to tell me ? In my opinion voluntary registration would be a mere waste of time. Honest people would comply with it [or perhaps suffer under such a system] whereas the dishonest man would score every time and I do not think that you can claim absolute honesty for every one of your co-religionists any more than I pretend to do so for Europeans or people of European descent.
 ESSOP MIA’S REPLY
Mr. Essop Mia has thereupon sent the following reply:libtech_324_footnote
 I have the honour to tender to you the thanks of my Association for your very courteous, frank, and full letter. The greatest stumbling-block in the way ofa proper solution of the Indian question has been, undoubtedly, the fact that public men among the whites are not well-informed about the question.
 I am deeply thankful for the sympathy you express for my countrymen who have vested interests in this Colony, and it is because the fight is entirely for the protection of such interests that I see in your attitude a common meeting-ground.
 Not only does my Association sympathise with the objection to wholesale immigration from India, but it has recognised its validity, in view of the very general prejudice against such immigration, and has always offered to co-operate with the Government in attaining the object.
 The ground is now clear for an examination of the Asiatic Act on its
 
 
vide “Letter to J. A. Neser”, 28-9-1907
 
 merits. When, in the September of 1906, the Asiatic Act was drafted, fingerprints were not even so much as mentioned. The attitude of my Association would not, therefore, have been in any way altered, had signatures been substituted for finger-prints. It is the sting of compulsion running throughout the Act that offends and bears so heavily on the community. The finger-prints do not offend any religious susceptibility, but the exception made in the Act in favour of Turkish Christians and Turkish Jews does most emphatically wound religious feelings.
 The Act bristles with severe penalties for breaches of the varied requirements thereof, but it is the underlying assumption that Indians, as a class, are capable of impersonation, fraudulent transfers of permits, and fraudulently bringing unauthorised immigrants into the country that is most strongly and, I think, rightly objected to. Whenever in a country exceptional penalties are provided for a particular offence, the general existence of such an offence in that country is, as you are aware, presumed. Knowing well that British Indians, as a class, have not been guilty of the practices above described, they manfully struggle to avoid the presumption which the Act has made tacitly. It should, moreover, be borne in mind that this Law is a class measure of an obnoxious type, and is calculated to degrade British Indians in the estimation of Malays, with whom many of them are nearly related, Cape Coloured men, with whom they come in close contact, and the Kaffir races, who are largely employed by them as their servants. While all these are, in common with the other inhabitants of the Colony, exempt from any such restrictions on their personal liberty, Asiatics have been especially singled out.
 The obvious answer to the last objection is, naturally, that it is the competition of the Asiatics that is feared, and it is because my Association recognizes this that voluntary identification or registration has been suggested. Such voluntary registration will not insult Indians, will satisfy the European objection wholly, and will protect vested rights. You seem to think that voluntary registration will leave untouched dishonest Indians, whose existence I do not deny, but that is, I beg to state, a mistake. Under the voluntary offer, it has been submitted to the Government that by a short Bill, passed by consent, the Act can be made applicable to those who do not comply with the offer. Indeed, at a stated period, all Indians or Asiatics may be examined simultaneously, and those who are found to be without the new identification certificates may be bundled out of the Colony under a General Immigration Law.
 I will conclude by saying that, while my countrymen have honestly endeavoured to examine and meet reasonable objections raised by Europeans, the latter have, as a body, entirely failed to reciprocate, but have simply persevered in their policy of prejudiced opposition without caring to examine the Indian position. As you have been, in your professional capacity, very
 largely connected with British Indians, I may not be wrong in asking you to step into our shoes and look at the whole position from our standpoint, and see whether a reasonable compromise is not possible by the exercise of a little patience and some co-operation.
 WARNING TO WITNESSES GIVING FALSE EVIDENCE
 Five Indians were being tried for robbery  before Mr. Wenderburg at Johannesburg. The magistrate thought that the evidence given by the complainant and some other Indians was false. He rebuked the witnesses. Finding the evidence weak, he discharged the accused without examining them. In the crowded court, he told the many Indians who were present that these days there were many faked cases among them, and that, if such cases occurred in future, the witnesses would be prosecuted for giving false evidence. I feel sorry to give publicity to this fact. But I think it necessary to bring it to the notice of all. The Indian community loses its good name on account of such cases, and we suffer humiliation. I understand that the witnesses were merely pawns in the hands of some schemers, and it was these schemers who were the real culprits. I must tell them that it is not proper for them to ruin poor people for a little gain to themselves, and to bring the community as well as themselves into contempt. There are many ways of earning money other than getting up false cases.
 WHAT TO DO IF PERMIT IS LOST?
 A correspondent asks this question. The remedy is simple: go about without a permit. Since the fear of gaol has disappeared, one should boldly appear before a magistrate, if required. When the case is investigated, such a man will be released. When the final notice is published, even permits held will be as good as lost. For no one will be released on production of the old permit. Therefore, those who wish to defy the new law have no reason to be afraid of the loss of permits.
 NEW SPECTRE
 There is a case at present which may mean that trade licences will not be issued under the “Gold Law”. I believe the Government is wrong in having brought up this case. The matter is likely to go up to the Supreme Court, and so, further comment is not necessary. The Government’s intention to apply the “Gold Law” shows that there is going to be no peace or rest for those submitting to the new law. If, however, the obnoxious law is repealed, the “Gold Law”, in my opinion, will crumble to the ground as a matter of course.
 SMUTS’ REPLY
 To the petition for slavery sent by some gentlemen of Pretoria Mr. Smuts has sent a replylibtech_325_footnotesuch as will be deserved by slaves. He says that if people comply with the provisions of the Asiatic Act, their chains will be inspected by the whites, and not by the Kaffirs. The other demands will not be granted. If possible, I shall give next week a full translation of this reply. It is worth reading. Along with it, I also hope to give some important news relating to the struggle at Johan- nseburg.

 JOHANNESBURG,
 October 7, 1907
 THE HON’BLE THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PRETORIA
SIR,
 I have been directed by the Committee of my Association humbly to address a few remarks on your speech delivered to your constituents and containing reference to the Asiatic Law Amendment Act. If the report published in the papers be correct, it contains, in my humble opinion, many misstatements of facts.
 My Association feels deeply grieved that from your responsible position you should give currency to the popular inaccuracy as to the cause of the depression. Those who are engaged in business havestated emphatically that the cause of the terrible depression is to
 
 be sought elsewhere. In any case, it has affected Indians just as much as Europeans.
 My Association totally denies the statement that there are 15,000 Indians at present in the Colony. An analysis of the figures which have been received by my Association will shortly be submitted to you which go[es] to show that there are at present not more than 7,000 Indians in the Transvaal.
 You have been pleased to state that certificates issued under the old Law have been fraudulently duplicated and sold, and that, in Bombay, Johannesburg and Durban, there are known to be places where these manufactured certificates could be bought by Indians for so much cash. My Association repudiates the statement entirely and respectfully invites a public inquiry into the matter, but  my Association is aware that there was in the Registration Office a clerk who carried on a traffic in forged permits and undoubtedly used as his tools some Indians who had no notion either of their nationality or their honour. That, however, is totally different from what you have been pleased to place before the public.
 You have, again, been pleased to state that the Indians have objected to this Act because of the fingerprints; My Association has very often submitted to the Government that the fingerprints are not a primary cause of the Indian opposition, but the principle of compulsion and the whole object of the legislation which  stamps British Indians as criminals. When the objections against the measure were first framed, fingerprints were not even so much as mentioned. At the same time, I take the liberty of pointing out that the Indians who have come to the Transvaal have never been called upon to give either their finger-impressions or even their thumb-impressions in India. While thumb-prints are undoubtedly taken in India, in some cases not connected with criminality, the digit-impressions are taken only from criminals or those who are in any way connected with crimes, and, even thumb-impressions are taken, the rule applies in cases of illiterates only.
 My Association has always been aware of the intention of the Government to enforce the Act strictly and rigorously, but I may be permitted to mention once more that the most rigorous enforcement of the Law would be as nothing compared to the degradation involved in submission to it and violation of the community’s solemn and deliberate undertaking not to accept the Law. My Association feels that, although you have declared that you have especially studied the Indian point of view of the question, the whole spirit of the opposition as also the most important points raised by my Association have been
 entirely missed by you. In conclusion, I beg to repeat that my Association has always appreciated the objection against a wholesale influx of British Indians and against unrestricted competition in trade, and, with a view of showing the bona fides of the community, has come forward with humble suggestions which would completely meet the two objections, but it is impossible for British Indians to surrender what little self-respect may be left to them by accepting a measure which was conceived in ignorance of the true state of things, which is oppressive to a degree in its incidents, and which hurts the religious susceptibilities of the community represented by my Association.
 l have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servant, ESSOP ISMAIL MIA CHAIRMAN,

         TO THE 	EDITOR       JOHANNESBURG,  October 	9, [1907] 
 [RAND 	DAILY MAIL JOHANNESBURG] SIR,  	As you were good enough to warmly take up the case of Mr. Suliman 	Mangalibtech_327_footnoteand 	an Indian woman named Punialibtech_328_footnote, who were both grossly ill-treated, I take the liberty 	of inviting your attention to a third case that has come under my 	observation, which equals, if it does not surpass, the other two in 	wanton insult.  	Mr. Anthony Peters, a born Indian Christian, and an old civil 	servant of Natal, at present Interpreter at the Chief Magistrate’s 	Court, Pietermaritzburg, was on his way to Johannesburg on Sunday 	and was a passenger by the Johannesburg Mail which left 	Pietermaritzburg on Saturday. He held a concession ticket and a 	certificate from the Railways in which his official position was 	described. At Volksrust, the     
 Examining Constable put him through a searching cross-examination. Mr. Peters produced his permit, which was issued to him at a time when the Indian community had not voluntarily given thumb impressions. This did not satisfy the Constable. Mr. Peters, therefore, produced the concession ticket referred to by me and offered to give his signature, but all to no avail, the Constable insulting him by saying that he might have got somebody else’s concession ticket. Mr. Peters, therefore, went so far as to produce his walking-stick, which bore his initials, and his shirt, which bore his full name. Even this was not satisfactory. He then offered to deposit money to ensure his return after three days, but the Constable ordered a Kaffir policeman to literally drag Mr. Peters out of the compartment. Sergeant Mansfield, before whom Mr. Peters was taken, realised the terrible mistake, apologised to Mr. Peters, and let him go. That, however, was small comfort. Added to the insult was weary waiting at Volksrust, where he knew nobody, and a large slice taken out of his all too brief holiday of three days. Mr. Peters returns to his duty tonight. I need hardly comment upon this episode, beyond saying that this is a sample of what many a respectable Indian has to suffer in even visiting this country. Here there is no question of general legislation, no question of an Asiatic influx, but a question of simple courtesy and justice between man and man. Or is the wearing of a coloured skin to be, in the words of Mrs. Vogl who wrote the other day to the Glasgow Herald, a crime against the white people of the Transvaal?
 I am, etc.,

201,,INDIANS AT THE CAPE,"
    
 Though somewhat late in the day, we reproduce in another column the reportlibtech_329_footnotelibtech_330_footnotefrom  the  Cape Times  of an   important  test  case heard before the Cape Supreme Court and arising out of the Immigration Law. We have before now expressed our great regret for the lethargy of the leading Cape Indians when the  immigration  measure was passing through the Cape Parliament. We feel sure that a law of that description would undoubtedly have been considerably modified, had representations been made. Though the facts of the case are fully dealt with in the report, they will bear repetition here. A certain Indian domiciled at the Cape, having landed property there,
 
 and being a general dealer since 1897, intended to visit India and, in order to avoid inconvenience at the time of his return, wanted a permit to absent himself from the Colony for a period to be fixed by him. The Immigration Officer refused to do so, offering a permit whose period was to be decided by himself. Whether the Immigration Officer’s offer was reasonable or not is not the question, because on the one hand there was an attempt to get the right, on the other hand an attempt to deny the right. The Immigration Officer said the gran- ting of a permit to an Asiatic to absent himself was a concession. The Asiatic said he demanded it as a matter of right. The Supreme Court has now decided that, in accordance with the law, there was no inhe- rent right in the Asiatic to receive a permit of absence. In the abstract, the thing is simply farcical, in that it reduces Asiatics to a state of slavery, for which no one is to blame but the leading Indians themselves. The most interesting point, however, raised in the course of the argument was left undecided. The first section of the Immig- ration Act seems to preserve the rights created under the Immigration Act of 1902 repealed by the Act in question. It states that:
 Such repeal shall not affect any acts or things done or commenced, any rights, privileges, or protection acquired, any penalties or liabilities incurred, any disability or disqualification existing, ally offences committed or any proceedings taken at the commencement of this Act.
 Now Act 47 of 1902 safeguarded the rights of Asiatics among others who were domiciled in South Africa. It would appear, then, that the rights of Indians who were settled before 1902 at the Cape or even in South Africa are not detrimentally affected by the Act of 1906. Justice Maasdorp clearly stated that the point could only be raised and decided on an Indian, domiciled at the Cape before 1902, leaving, it and returning without having taken out the permit of absence. It is very simple, and we trust that the Indians at the Cape will lose no time in having the right tested. The custom of issuing permits of absence is extremely oppressive, and undoubtedly interferes with the freedom of movement that every independent man must claim.

202,,ABOUT “INDIAN OPINION”,"
    
 Our readers must have noticed that originally we gave  four pages to the Gujarati section, but later increased them to eight and then again to 12. For some weeks past the number has gone up to 13, 14 and even 15. Now we intend to give 16 pages every time. Owing to
 several difficulties, it may occasionally happen that we cannot give so many pages. Such an increase involves additional expenditure to us, though that will not deter us, for our aim is to earn our bread through public service. Service is the principal object. Earning a livelihood takes the second place. From the time that Indian Opinion was foundedlibtech_331_footnotetill today, no one has thought of making money out of it, and no one will ever think of it in future. Hence we intend to give to the reader greater benefits in proportion to the rise in income. If and when there remains any balance after the salaries of those connected with the journal reach a certain level, all of it will be spent on public work.
 We are convinced that an increased circulation of  Indian Opinion will mean growth of education and patriotism among us. The journal has at present only 1,100 subscribers, though the number of readers is much larger. If all readers buy their copies, Indian Opinion can render three times better service than it does today. We hope it will not be considered unreasonable of us if we expect encouragement in proportion to the increase in the number of our pages. If those who fully realize the value of the service rendered by this paper secure even one additional subscriber each, we shall feel heartened thereby and get some help in meeting the increased expenditure consequent upon the increase in the number of pages.

203,,SOUTH AFRICA BRITISH INDIAN COMMITTEE,"
    
 This Committee is about a year old now.libtech_332_footnoteWhether it should be continued or not for another year depends on the Indians of South Africa. This question has been raised by Mr. Ritch. We draw the attention of every Indian to his letter.
 The Committee has put in a tremendous amount of work which, as every Indian can see, has borne excellent fruit. Today our ship is atmid-sea, and to dissolve the Committee at this juncture will, we think, amount to scuttling it.
 It is not the Transvaal alone that profits by the services of the Committee but the whole of South Africa. Johannesburg is not alone
 
 
 in having gained some benefits in regard to the question of the Vrededorp Ordinance. It should be considered an advantage to all that the Ordinance has been amended, and that an impression was created on the public. If the struggle against the new law succeeds, every Indian will stand to gain. This is not all the achievement of the Committee. The Natal Municipal Act is as good as repealed and the credit for it can go only to the Committee. The Committee is still fighting the question of licences. With regard to the question of Delagoa Bay, we think it was the Committee’s correspondence that produced an effect. If the Cape Indians were to wake up from their slumber, the Committee in England could also put up a fight against the law concerning them.
 The Committee includes many renowned men. Without,  however, the services of Mr. Ritch, it could not function at all. Sir Mancherji Bhownaggree puts in much effort, but this is only one of his many activities. As for Mr. Ritch, all his time is taken up by the work of the Committee. For the present, therefore, the Committee cannot function without him. Mr. Ritch is now due to return to South Africa, but he appears to be willing to continue there.
 Let us now consider the question of expense. When the Committee was founded, the minimum expenditure was estimated at
£300 per year. But the work turned out to be so heavy that the sum of
 £500 already sent to the Committee was found to be insufficient. That the Committee could manage with so little expenditure means that Mr. Ritch received only a nominal salary. Even that he would not have accepted. But it was not possible for him to maintain himself there without it. From now, all the expenses of Mr. Ritch should be met by us. According to his estimate, the total expenditure for one year will come to £1,000. If the Committee works at full speed for one year, we should put down its requirements at £500. Add to this the £500 to be paid to Mr. Ritch. The total will thus come to £1,000. We can make adjustment in the miscellaneous items of expenditure, but not in the expenses to be allowed to Mr. Ritch. For, his expenditure in England will easily amount to so much.
 This is a problem that needs careful thought from every Indian; and it has to be taken up by every association. Every part of South Africa ought to contribute to the Committee’s expenses.
 It should not be too much for the Cape, Rhodesia, Delagoa Bay, Natal and the Transvaal combined to bear this expenditure. Even at so much expense, it is not ordinarily possible to have such a Committee
 and to get such work. It is only because Mr. Ritch is not a paid servant but looks after the work as if it were his own, that he can manage with the sum mentioned above.
 We shall publish our readers’ views on this subject if they are sent in brief letters. We shall also receive contributions which any persons may desire to make, and in due course they will get receipts from the Association.

204,,SMUTS’ SPEECH,"
    
 A full translation of the speech delivered by Mr. Smuts  in Pretoria appears in our Johannesburg newsletter. It deserves careful reading and attention. Mr. Smuts has spoken in his pride, but God does not allow a man’s pride to last long. The same thing will  probably happen to Mr. Smuts’ pride.
 The arrogance of this gentleman can be equalled only by his ignorance. We are happy to note that Mr. Essop Mia has already sent a fitting reply to this gentleman.
 Mr. Smuts speaks as if the British Government counts  for nothing with him. It is also likely that the Liberal Party might go against him as a result of such speeches. It is immaterial to us whether or not that Party opposes him.
 Let us take some instances of Mr. Smuts’ ignorance. He says that it is only against finger-prints that we are fighting. This is absolutely absurd. Though[the giving of] finger-prints is one of the questions, our struggle is not based on that question. The chief reason for the fight is that the law stamps us as criminals and liars, and attacks our community and humiliates us in the eyes of the whites and the Coloured peoples and wants to crush us as if we are altogether worthless. Ignoring all these considerations, Mr. Smuts lays stress only upon the question of finger-prints and so makes fun of us to amuse the white people. Mr. Essop Mia has already sent him a stinging reply to these lies and to the other accusations. It is a grave charge that he makes when he says that there are places in Johannesburg, Bombay and Durban where permits are fraudulently duplicated.
 But Mr. Smuts’ views deserve more attention than his  falsehoods. From what Mr. Smuts says, it can be seen that his whole
 
 attack is on businessmen. The Indian businessman has become the special object of his dislike. He openly says that he will send the businessmen to the Location. At any cost, he wants to reserve the Transvaal exclusively for the whites. He blames the present slump on the Indian businessman. And he will not rest so long as he does not uproot him. He thinks that if we accept the law, he will be able to do whatever he likes. If after starting a big struggle and taking oaths, we go to sleep, it will be quite easy [for him] to give us kicks. The Indian businessmen must especially realize from this that, if they get registered, they will suffer a double loss. They will lose face, they will be condemned by Indians and even after soiling their hands and faces, they will have to go to the Locations and be ruined. If they remain firm and fight, their prestige will be maintained. Prestige alone is real money; not only that, there is every possibility that by remaining firm we may win the fight. That means, their business will be saved. There is only one way of saving ourselves, and that is to fight against the law. Otherwise, we are as good as dead from this very moment.
 Besides, we take Mr. Smuts’ speech to be merely a form of threat. The man of action does not speak much. Barking dogs seldom bite. The hooded serpent does not bite, but only hisses. On the one hand, Mr. Smuts says that every Indian will be deported in December; on the other hand, that in January licences will be cancelled and the stores closed down. What is the truth ? If all are to be driven out in December, then whose shops will be closed down? Such words are spoken only by a man mad with rage. Moreover, the authority to deport is not yet given to him. He has started holding out threats of deportation even before that. We take this to be merely a children’s play. Finally, how can the man who holds his good name dear to himself fear deportation or imprisonment? The Indian community, which has placed its trust in God, is not likely to be afraid of a thousand Smutses.
 Mr. Smuts goes on repeating the same thing; on the other hand, we see that in England our strength is increasing. It is learnt from the telegrams received on Tuesday that the Aborigines Protection Society and the Union of Ethical Societies have passed a joint  resolution saying that the Asiatic Act is bad, and that therefore the Indian Government, the Colonial Office and the Transvaal Government ought to be considerate. All these associations and the newspapers of the world are with us. In view of this, whatever his strength and whatever his pride, what can Mr. Smuts do? Where is the man who can do any harm to those whom God protects?

205,,WYBERGH’S SPEECH,"
    
 We give elsewhere the substance of a speech delivered by Mr. Wybergh in Bloemfontein.libtech_333_footnotelibtech_334_footnoteMr. Wybergh has shown that, if the whites want to progress, the blacks should be entirely segregated so that the former might not have the fast association with them. There is no need to say that the segregation of black people will also include that of the Asiatics. Such is the implication of Mr. Wybergh’s words. Indians are not less civilized than the whites. On the contrary, they claim a more ancient civilization than that of the whites, of which Mr. Wybergh in his selfishness has no idea. In plain words, it means that, if Mr. Wybergh could have his own way, he would pack Indians off the very next day to live by themselves. Whether or not he and his other associates will be able to do this depends very much on the strength which the Indians are able to show at present. We already hear the first rumblings of a warning that, if Indians beat a retreat in the present struggle, the whites will regard them as worthless and drive them away to live in segregation. Will not the Indians realize this and be on their guard? On the one hand, Mr. Smuts has given threats as to what he will do if we do not submit to the law. On the other, Mr. Wybergh has already given us to understand, though indirectly, that once we submit to the law (that is, convince them that we are stuffless), no time will be lost before we are driven away to live in segregation. If anyone is frightened by Mr. Smuts’ threats, then Mr. Wybergh’s words are no less worthy of attention. There is only one remedy and that is for the Indians to remain firm in the present struggle and prove their mettle.

206,,CAPE INDIANS,"
    
 The more we read about the Cape Immigration Act, the more we blame the Indian leaders. We think the case fought on behalf of Mr. Dharsey of Vryburg was an important one. We have reported it in full in English and have also offered our comments on it.libtech_335_footnoteWe give here such of the facts of the case as can be easily understood.
 Mr. Dharsey has been doing business in the Cape since 1897. He asked for a temporary permit for 18 months to go to India. The officer refused to give such a permit, and offered to give a permit for
 
 one year. Mr. Dharsey asked for the permit as a matter of right. The officer said he had no such right; it was the officer’s discretion whe- ther or not to grant a permit. There upon Mr. Dharsey took the matter to the court. The Supreme Court dismissed his application and held that an Indian could not compel an officer to give [him] a permit.
 This judgment means that, if an Indian leaves the Cape without permission, he cannot return. As the power of giving a permit rests with the officer, the Indians are for ever imprisoned in the Cape. That permits are at present being given to all means nothing at all, but that a permit should have to be asked for is itself tyrannical. There is no such law anywhere else. In Natal, once a certificate is issued, it is valid for ever. In the Transvaal, too, the certificate intended to be issued will be a permanent one. In the Cape, when an Indian wants to go out, he must take a “ticket of leave”. If he does not take it and if he does not know English, he cannot return. We hold this to be a very oppressive measure. Besides, for such a ‘ticket of leave”, a fee of £l has to be paid. There is not much difference between this and slavery. Why cannot one leave the Cape without a “ticket of leave” ?
 There are remedies yet. One is that the Cape leaders should put up a big fight and get the law amended. The other is that they should show their strength at the Cape election. There is also another sting in the law which is worth noting. Every Indian is compelled to give his photograph. That some people are not asked to show the photograph need not flatter anyone. If influential people are excluded from this, what benefit does it mean to the Indian community? That will not preserve our honour in any way.
 There is a third way which we may think of. In the course of the argument in the above-mentioned case, it was submitted that the Act of 1906 was not applicable to those Indians who had been living in the Cape since before 1902. As this question was not one of the points for decision in the case, the Court did not give a ruling on it, and declared that it would consider the question as and when such a case arose. According to the Act of 1902, any Indian living in  South Africa had the right to enter the Cape. From this it is assumed that the Act of 1906 cannot be applied to Indians living there since before 1902. If this argument is correct, then such Indians do not require “tickets of leave”. In order to raise such a case in a court of law, an Indian residing there from before 1902 should go out of the Cape and try to return. If the Immigration Officer prevents him, then the question can be raised in the Supreme Court. There is no doubt at all
 that this question is worth raising. These are the three steps which the Cape Indians can take, and we hope they will take all of them.

207,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER.,"
    
 SMUTS REPLY TO DISGRACEFUL LETTER
 I said earlier that Mr. Smuts had replied to the  petition  submitted to him by Mr. Roos on behalf of certain Indian leaders. Here is a translation of the reply:libtech_336_footnote
 I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th August last on the subject of the regulations framed under the Asiatic Law Amendment Act (No. 2 of 1907) and to inform you as follows:
  If 	Asiatics who 	are residing in 	the Transvaal 	submit to the 	provisions of the 	law in question, the Government is  prepared 	to accede 	to their 	request that special 	authority be 	granted empowering 	certain selected officers, who 	shall be 	white persons, 	to call 	for the production 	of certificates 	from Indians 	except in 	cases of 	suspicion or crime.  Clerks 	who issue trading 	licences will not 	be em- powered to 	investigate the bona 	fides of applicants.

 AS THE GIFTS, SO THE SONGSlibtech_337_footnote
 Accordingly, the gentlemen on whose behalf the petition was addressed have received the reply that they deserve. This reply shows that Mr. Smuts has not conceded even a single point. The demand that the permits should be inspected by white officers  would  not  be granted if the applicants alone got themselves specially registered, but only if all Indians submitted to the law. If I were at all to have my hands blackened, I for one would say that it  would  make  no difference whether my register was inspected by a white or a black. If the black inspects it, he may be a little polite. Readers may inform me if there is any instance of a white officer having been polite to slaves. I shall then do my best to make the name of such white officer immortal through this paper.
 As for the remaining demands, Mr. Smuts has given a flat refusal, and that too in language deserved by those who would make themselves slaves. He has also shown how some of the demands were pointless. For instance, the one pertaining to boys. Even if Mr. Smuts desired to do so, he could not lay hands on boys under 16 years without amending the new law. If a child does not give its finger-prints, it cannot be punished, but the father who fails to teach his child the alphabet of slavery will be punished! How can the Government afford to have sons of slaves grow up in a spirit of independence? The sons of Englishmen learn drill and know how to handle a gun from the age of eight. We, however, have been branded as slaves; hence our sons can only have an education for slavery. “Like father, like son”: this has always been so. What further comment on the reply should I make? It will be enough to say just this: If the cruel blow dealt by this letter should in some degree rouse the spirit of our brethren at Pretoria, they might yet give up their attachment to money and make bold to send a fitting reply to Mr. Smuts, and retrieving their mistake, heartily join the fight that is being waged by the Indian community. Indeed, Mr. Smuts’ letter should provoke every Indian. It should lead every Indian lion to  this decision: “I shall have nothing to do with the Transvaal, if Mr. Smuts
 
 will let me stay here only on the terms mentioned in his letter. There is the great God to provide for us. A mere crumb of bread He will give at any other place as well.” Once we are inspired by such a spirit, people will see how glorious our struggle can be. Such persons, like the brave Thoreau, will find gaol to be a palace, and the cry of challenge from Indians in prison shall pierce Mr. Smuts through and through.
 HAJEE CASSIM’S EXPLANATION
 The responsibility for Mr. Roos’s letter is placed on Mr. Hajee Cassim. He, therefore, believes that injustice has been done to him, and offers the following explanation, which I place before the community. Mr. Hajee Cassim writes:
 The petition submitted to the Colonial Secretary was made jointly by certain gentlemen. Again, it was couched in humble language not at my instance but on the advice of the counsel. We, too, thought it proper to apply to the Government in humble terms. People had joined in making that application, thinking that a humble petition would induce the Government to grant our demands. They all gave their consent. It is not true that it was especially I who got the application made. Indian Opinion wrongly lays the blame at my door. It is wholly undeserved. To get registered or not depends on one’s own will. Someone seems to have supplied you with false information. It is not proper to rely upon it and wrongly mention my name in the paper. From the very first, I have publicly told the leaders of the British Indian Association that, as long as God kept up my courage, I would go along with my brethren and that, even if I were to lose courage in the end, I would do whatever might be necessary on their advice and with their assistance.
 It is quite a different matter if the charge against me is that of joining the other gentlemen in sending the petition. I have always been a person of mild temper, and I joined [them] thinking that those seeking a compromise with the Government were doing a wise thing. For, like the rest I also thought that the law would not be repealed and the better course would be only to seek amendments through an understanding with the Govern- ment and thus handle the situation in a spirit of compromise. The struggle put up by the British Indian Association is just, I have full sympathy with it, and I wish it godspeed.
 SMUTS SPEECH
 Mr. Smuts made a speechlibtech_338_footnoteat a meeting in his constituency, in which he also touched upon the question of the new law. I give below a translation of his speech:libtech_339_footnote
 There is yet another Asiatic question—namely, the Indians and the Chinese living in the country. These  people  are detrimentalto the everlasting prosperity of South Africa. Under the old law, Indians could not remain in the country unless they allowed themselves to be registered and paid a certain sum of money. Under that law, all Indians were registered. However, on account of the severe competition from the Indians, the Volksraad passed a law whereby Indians could only trade in Bazaars. But the British Government stepped in, and said that these people were their subjects, and according to the London Convention, all their subjects are to be treated alike. The law thus became impracticable, and the result was that the Indians carried on trade all over the country. They carried on business without a licence, and they were thereby even better off than the white traders. This position, however intolerable, was kept up by the British Government till the war broke out. The result may now be studied in Prinsloo Street, Pretoria, Pietersburg, Potchefstroom and other centres, where trade is largely in the hands of the Indian storekeepers. And yet people persist in asking—Whence this depression? Why all this poverty ?
 Indian trade is one of the causes thereof. The Indians have tried to get the same hold here as they have done in Natal. They want to have all trade in their hands. The Government has tackled the question. We have passed a law unanimously, making it compulsory for Indians to register. I think it highly desirable that the public should know the exact details of the law, as I expect that there may be trouble over it. The law has been made severe because of the large number of Indians we have to deal with, there being no fewer than 15,000 Indians and 1,200 Chinese storekeepers in the Colony. Certificates issued under the old law have been fraudulently duplicated and sold. In Bombay, Johannesburg and Durban there are known to be places where these manufactured certificates can be bought by Indians for so
 
 much cash, and as one Indian cannot be well distinguished from another, the Government has decided to have the finger-print system. The Indians object to this on the plea that it is too degrading. (Laughter.) A deputation of Indians went to England and interviewed the Government, but the latter sanctioned the law. I have personally investigated the pleading of the Indians. What do I find? I find that these self-same people have to make their finger impressions before they leave India, where the  system is in vogue for several objects. Any person being an ex-official or ex-soldier in India entitled to a pension must put his finger-prints down, otherwise he cannot draw his pension. All these things came to light when the Indians sent a deputation to England. The Indians think that they can fool the present Government, but they will soon find out their mistake.
 The Indians have been given time to register. The Government has found that pickets of coolies have been placed near the Registration Office, with the result that only a few registrations have taken place, but I may just remind them that all things have an end. The law will be rigidly enforced, and any Indian who has not registered himself after expiry of the period for registration will be put across the border. A new notice has been issued that on December 31 no traders’ licences will be issued unless registration has taken place. The Indians have to register now. This is their last chance, as after the date given no registration will be allowed. The result will be that no licences will be issued, and all Indian stores will be closed down. (Loud applause.) The Indians evidently think that the Government will give in, but I assure you that the Government does not contemplate any such course. I warn the Indians that the Government will insist on the strict enforcement of the law, and I trust that the newspapers will make it fairly plain that on December 31 the doors will be closed against them for ever. I have no quarrel with the Indians; the object is not persecution, but a stoppage of the influx of Indians. We have made up our mind to make this a white man’s country, and, however difficult the task before us in this matter, we have put our foot down, and shall keep it there. (Loud applause.)
 ESSOP MIA’S REJOINDER
 
Mr. Essop Mia has given a reply to this speech which I translate
 
 below:libtech_340_footnote
 ASSOCIATION MEETING
 With the permission of the Hamidia Islamic Society, a meeting of the Association took place at the Society’s hall last Sunday. Mr. Essop Mia took the chair. The hall was packed to capacity. Mr. Quinn, President of the Chinese Association, and other Chinese were also present. After Mr. Essop Mia’s speech, Mr. Gandhi said with reference to the pickets that it was necessary for them to use utmost courtesy. They should not stand in a group at any one place. They were in the position of soldiers. The soldier’s duty was to carry out orders, maintain discipline and never leave the place of duty. Soldiers had a leader over them, and he should also be obeyed. If any of the pickets whose names were with Mr. Gandhi were arrested while they were doing their duty, he (Mr. Gandhi) would defend them. If, however, they should be sentenced to a fine, they were not to pay it, but must go to gaol instead. Pickets who misbehaved or went in for violentquarrels would not be defended in any way. Then Mr. Gandhi went on to explain the need to continue the South Africa British Indian Committee, and referred to Mr. Ritch’s letter in detail. Afterwards the meeting was addressed by Messrs Emam Abdool Cadir,
 T. Naidoo, Abdul Rahman (of Potchefstroom), Nawab  Khan,  Coovadia, Ali Mahomed, Joseph, Omarji Sale and others.  They pointed out that the Committee must be maintained. Mr. Joseph asked what was to be done for those losing their jobs. In reply, Mr. Gandhi said that all of them had to suffer every hardship that might befall, including that of going to gaol. If those in service cared for their honour, they would not care for their jobs. If a person lost his job, he could get another. But honour once lost could never be regained. If a job were lost for the sake of the country, what would it matter? In regard to licence notices, Mr. Gandhi said in reply to a question by Mr. Coovadia that, if no licence was issued, the only proper thing would be to go to gaol. But there would be no difficulty in trading without a licence. If, however, the Indian community felt afraid, a test case could be made. That would, of course, need money.
 MEETING OF PICKETS
A separate meeting of pickets was held prior to the meeting
 
 
 referred to above. Every question was tackled with great courage. Men were appointed to watch every station and the Von Brandis Square. Badges have been prepared for everyone, so that a picket can be easily identified. The list of pickets has undergone some change, but I do not intend to give any names now. For, it is probable that there may be still further changes. At the end of the month, I shall give the names of those who will have worked as pickets. Among the names given in the last issue, two identical names were printed. They should be read as Narotam Amthabhai Patel (of Vanz) and Naranji Karsanji Desai (of Chhina).
 SUGGESTION TO KRUGERSDORP INDIANS
 I find that Krugersdorp Indians are still working through the reporter of the Rand Daily Mail. They have given excessive emphasis to [finger-]prints. But it is necessary to realize that we refuse to submit to the law because it singles us out as its target and thereby brands us as criminals. Such Indians ought to go through the past numbers of Indian Opinion and acquaint themselves with all the facts.
 CASES AGAINST HAWKERS
 Some cases against hawkers were heard at Boksburg. The magistrate is to decide whether it is an offence for a hawker to remain in a private building for more than 20 minutes. Being sympathetically inclined towards one of the hawkers, the magistrate let him off. The same thing may happen in connection with the new law, too.
 PICKET ARRESTED
 The police arrested a picket named Mr. Bhana Chhania on a charge of obstructing pedestrians by standing on the footpath. The case was heard by Mr. Cross. Mr. Gandhi defended the accused free of charge, and the Magistrate discharged him. It was arranged that he should go to gaol if he was fined. One should not take this to mean that one can keep standing on any footpath. The reason for his dis- charge was that no pedestrian was likely to be obstructed by reason of Mr. Bhana’s standing there. When the police object to anyone stand- ing at a particular spot, the best course is to move on to another place.

Still, tell him that he can strike off any fees charged by me and I shall accept his decision. With reference to his papers, I am looking into the matter. You can be very plain to him with reference to my bill. I should feel sorry for him to think that I could ever betray the trust reposed by him in me and charge fees in an unwarranted manner.

 October 15, 1907
 THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE JOHANNESBURG
SIR,
 I happened to be in court when Mr. Alexander mentioned, on behalf of two Indian clients of his, that they were frightened of the “pickets” in Von Brandis Square and that it was for that reason that they had not made their application for registration certificates. I repudiated the statement then, and I do so now. Some Indians are undoubtedly watching entrants to the Registration Office with a view to explaining to them the position they would be in owing to submission to the Asiatic Law Amendment Act and using their influence to prevent them from attending the office, but, should anyone intend to go to the office in spite of such persuasion, he is left totally unmolested. Such a case happened while Mr. Alexander was making his statement to the Magistrate. A young Indian lad wanted to be registered. He was with his mistress; and nobody prevented him. Another Indian, also, similarly went to the Registration Office in Von Brandis Square some time ago. I bring these facts to your notice, as it was suggested by Mr. Alexander that his clients should receive police protection, and, as a matter of fact, I now understand they did receive police escort.
 On behalf of my Association, I venture to give the assurance that no intimidation will be countenanced by the British Indian Association, and every effort will be used by my Association to see that no one who may wish to go to the Registration Office is molested by anyone connected with the Association. So far as I am aware, I am certain that Mr. Alexander was misinformed by his clients, who were
 
 more afraid of Indian public opinion than of any bodily harm.
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servant,

           TO  THE 	EDITOR 	THE STAR JOHANNESBURG] 	SIR,          JOHANNESBURG,  October 	18, 1907 
  	Whilst the totally inoffensive Indian pickets are being charged, 	without an iota of proof, with intimidation of those who may wish to 	take out registration certificates, you will, perhaps, be so good as 	to allow me to draw public attention to the hollowness of the 	charge, as also to counter-intimidation, which is a reality.  	A case happened yesterday in which three Indians from Pietersburg 	were actually offered escort by the pickets, but it was refused. The 	fact is that an attempt is being made to discredit the pickets by 	feigning terror, and by asking for police protection. We, too, have 	our “national scouts”. They undoubtedly wish to increase their  	number,  and  allegation  of  intimidation  is  one  of   the 	methods adopted. If there is any truth in the charge, why has not 	anyone been prosecuted? It must be theeasiest thing to prove, 	because intimidation is supposed to take place in broad daylight in  	Von  Brandis Square in the presence of hundreds of passers-by.  	As to counter-intimidation, many Indians believe that Indians 	possessing permits issued by either Capt. Hamilton-Fowle or Mr. 	Chamney are, under quasi-official pressure, being dismissed for not 	having submitted to the Registration Act. Whether such pressure 	exists    
 or not, I have before me a letter from the chief ganger at Germiston, confirming the information received that nine Indians were dismissed because they would not apply to be registered under the new Act. It causes little wonder, seeing that General Smuts himself has led the way. He has threatened all kinds of punishment—deportation and deprivation of licences at the same time for the same persons. How both can take place I do not know. Physical deportation is not even possible without the immigration measure, which has still to receive Royal sanction. Indians do not mind a fair fight, and, so far as I can see, they are prepared even for an unfair fight, though it will be strictly un-British. Why should the assistance of European employers be called in to force Indians to take out certificates of slavery? That many employers have up to now resisted any such pressure and positively declined to dismiss Indians in their employ redounds to the credit of both—of the employers because they will not take part in the process of hitting below the belt, of the Indians because they are too valuable and faithful servants to be dismissed.
 I have just learned that the four Indians on whose behalf it was stated that they were intimidated, and who were admittedly without any permits, have to-day been discharged and assured in the open Court that they will receive registration certificates. No doubt slaves deserve their badge. In my opinion, those who possess old Dutch passes, as these men are alleged to do, should be treated in the same way as those who have received permits under the Peace Preservation Ordinance, but it is a matter of public knowledge that Mr. Jordan had to perform the painful duty of giving all such persons notice to quit the Colony. One such man received notice the same day that the four men above-named stated they would apply for new registration certi- ficates. General Smuts is thus, indeed, finding out the lawful residents from the unlawful ones. The latter will become, under the Registration Act, the chosen people, because they will have applied for certificates under it, and the former, because they value their manliness more than worldly riches, will be turned into unlawful residents.
 I am, etc.,

212,,MR. RITCH’S SERVICES,"
    
 A member of the South Africa British Indian Committee writes of Mr. Ritch in the following strain:
 The Indian community can never be sufficiently grateful [for] or appreciative
 of the Herculean work and devotion of this able, capable, self-sacrificing man.
 Not only do Indians in South Africa endorse every adjective used above, but they realize that at no time can his services be so valuable as now. The Indians in the Transvaal are fighting a struggle the like of which will not recur in this generation. It is, therefore, imperative that Lord Ampthill, in his endeavour to secure redress for the Transvaal Indians, should be assisted by the ever-vigilant and indefatigable Mr. Ritch
 Indian Opinion, 19-10-1907
 "
213,,GENERAL BOTHA’S EXAMPLE,"
    
 Though the Indian community is fighting heroically in the Transvaal, there is a secret anxiety as to what will happen in the end. Anyone who feels such anxiety must have very little faith in truth and in God. To those who feel concerned for this or any other reason, we hold up the example of the present rulers of the Transvaal. Readers will remember that, before the whites of the Transvaal were granted self-government, Mr. Lyttelton had offered them partial self-govern- ment, on the advice of Lord Milner. General Botha, General Smuts and others could have joined it. But such rights appearing insufficient, General Botha wrote to Lord Milner to say that they would not participate in his Government and that they were not satisfied with the constitution which was offered to them. This piqued Lord Milner. There was a huge meeting at the Wanderers’ Hall. Speaking at the meeting, Lord Milner held out the threat to General Botha that if the Boers did not join in running the government, it would be carried on without them. The threat did not move General Botha. The result now is that the Boers have complete self-government. Here is an example of a great boycott. Botha carried out a boycott and won.
 It should be noted in regard to this instance that the Boers prepared themselves for a boycott because they did not get the additional rights they had demanded. We are not asking for more rights, but are opposing the yoke of slavery that is being imposed upon us. What is there for us to be afraid of in doing so? Botha’s boycott succeeded because he had full confidence, and because he convinced Lord Milner that it was not merely an empty threat he was holding out of not participating in the government, but that he meant what he said. In our struggle, Mr. Smuts is still not convinced that the Indians are really strong enough. We hope the Indian community will take a lesson from General Botha’s example and hold out to the last.

214,,LESSON FROM PETERS CASE,"
    
 Why did Mr. Peters have to suffer in Volksrust? This question ought to arise in the mind of every Indian. If a well-dressed European travels in a first or second-class carriage, he will be presumed to be a respectable man. In fact he may be a great criminal. In the case of a person with black skin, it will be presumed that he is a rogue, though in fact he may be a respectable man. This is what happened to Mr. Peters. The examining constable took it for granted that Mr. Peters had a false permit. The officer is not much to blame in this. The blame lies with the Government. They have passed the obnoxious law on the assumption that Indians are liars and the examining constable acted on it. Thus it is that the Indian is not respected today. If the Indian community were now to submit to the obnoxious law, how could it be surprising if the whites, apart from respecting an Indian, never even talked to him without first giving him a kick? It is for these strong reasons that the Indian is opposing the law, not on account of any one section in it, or because of finger-prints. If the root of the law is bad, what is the use of quarrelling with its twigs? It is necessary to lay the axe at the root. And that axe is the courage and manliness of Indians.

215,,RITCH’S SERVICES,"
    
 The services rendered to the Indian community by Mr. Ritch are beyond praise. One of the members of the Committee writes:
 When I speak of the London Committee, you should take it to mean Mr. Ritch. The Indian community can never be sufficiently grateful [for] or appreciative of the Herculean work and devotion of this able, capable, self-sacrificing man. I believe it will help you very much if you continue to maintain the Committee and let Mr. Ritch remain in London for the present. I am quite convinced that the existence of the Committee has shaken the confidence of the Transvaal Government. If the Committee is allowed to spend more, it can do a lot more.
 We do not believe there is any exaggeration in these words. We must see to it that we do not lose such valuable services for want of money.

216,,REGULATIONS ABOUT CLOSING HOURS FOR SHOPS IN TRANSVAAL,"
    
 Everyone knew that as in Natal, so in the Transvaal, a law would be passed to fix closing hours for shops. These regulations have now been passed and published. We give elsewhere a translation of the important provisions. We advise the Transvaal Indian traders and hawkers to read them very carefully; Indian business will suffer a little on account of these regulations, but the loss should be put up with. We suggest that every trader and hawker should fully respect them. It is because Indians break such laws that they attract unfavourable notice, and our enemies are provided with weapons against us. Where all are required to close the shops at the same time, there should be no need for anyone to keep his shop open longer.

 HAMIDIA MEETING
 This Society is growing in strength. The spirit of the people is also rising and both Hindus and Muslims shout with one voice that the law should be wrecked. On Sunday Mr. Emam Abdool Cadir took the chair. The Moulvi Saheb and the Dervish Saheb spoke at great length. Messrs Coovadia, Omarji Sale and others also spoke. Mr. H. A. Coovadia and others argued that since Mr. S. Haloo had soiled his hands and face and had applied for registration, he be boycotted. The suggestion was hailed by the whole meeting. The Society has recommended that all contacts with Mr. Haloo should be cut off, his employees should give notice and quit his service, and that other Indians should have no business dealings with him. Then a member of the Society, Mr. Dawji Patel of Klerksdorp, who was proceeding to India, paid all the arrears of subscription and also paid another ten shillings with a view to retaining his membership of the Society while he was away in India. The Society presented to him a silver medal. There were complimentary speeches by some gentlemen. Mr. Dawji Patel has already left for India.
 Next day (Monday) Mr. Haloo himself went to Mr. Gandhi’s office to express regret for having made the application to register himself. The pickets immediately came to know of this and sent a
 notice to Mr. Gandhi: “Please note that if Mr. Haloo visits your office again, you too will be boycotted.”
 In reply to the notice, Mr. Gandhi thanked the pickets and complimented them on having done their duty. I want all Indians to have the same burning enthusiasm always. Having such enthusiasm is unconnected with the question whether, if Mr. Haloo should offer a formal apology to the Society and express regret, his apology should be accepted or not. What is to be noted and acted upon is that a pledge once given must be observed and that the duty assigned to us must be carried out. It was the duty of the pickets to act as they did, so long as Mr. Haloo’s action had not been condoned.
 RAM SUNDAR PUNDIT’S CASE
 Mr. Ram Sundar Pundit has been receiving telegrams of congratulation from every place on his courage. He is full of confidence and the Indians at Germiston are keeping up his spirit. He has not been arrested so far. It will not be surprising if they are not able to arrest him, just as they could not arrest Abdul Kadir Kokati. I shall send a telegram before Friday to say what happens in this matter.
 PETERS CASE
 The ill-treatment to which Mr. Anthony Peters was subjected is still being discussed. The constable who was responsible for it has now gone back on his statement and denied having done anything to Mr. Peters. Now they have asked for Mr. Peters’ affidavit. The case is to continue.
 ILLUMUTHU’S CASE
 Illumuthu’s case is worth studying. I give below Mr. Vyas’s convincing letter on the subject:
 The magistrate has ordered Illumuthu to leave the country within two days. In 1897, Illumuthu had gone to Bulawayo. Before the war, he had been working on  Cook’s  Farm at Johannesburg. For a month he worked in Robinson Mine. At Bulawayo, he was kept for a short time in a mental hospital. The doctor sent him to a hospital here for change of climate. The warder of the hospital, on the orders of the Registrar, took him to the Registrar’s Office. There they asked for his particulars, which he gave as above. Ultimately, the Registrar served him with a notice to leave the country, with the result mentioned above. Illumuthu is still out of his mind. He has nothing with him except three rags. The Registrar did not offer him a pie by way of travelling expenses. The magistrate says that it is none of his concern. From the asylum, too, he has
 
 been given the discharge certificate.
 This is a harrowing case. Illumuthu is a pauper. He is an old resident of the place. If he had not applied for registration, no one would have concerned himself with him. But he was made to apply and has now been served with a notice to leave the country. Where should he go ? Where could he get the money from? Why should he go ? The Indian who submits to such an oppressive law will be called to account both by the Indian community and by God. Those who, being without permits, apply for registration will be reduced to the plight of Illumuthu, and they will deserve it. Their safety lies not in rubbing their fingers [i.e., giving finger-prints] but in leaving the Transvaal and, if their case is strong, in going to gaol. The gaol is now the place for honest and truthful men.
 CHINESE UNITY
 Messrs Harvin and Paterson, a prominent business firm here, have a large business with the Chinese. They supply them on credit goods worth about £500 every month. The firm gave notice to the Chinese that further credit would be stopped if they did not take out the new registers. The Chinese, instead of being intimidated by this, became bolder. In reply, they asked the amount of the debit entries against them in the firm’s books, offering immediate payment, and declining to do any further business with the firm.
 Mr. Harvin was silenced by this reply, apologized to the Chinese and agreed not to refer any more to the registers or to their accounts. Our merchants, when threatened by white merchants, get scared and become ready to take out registers as if they were slaves. They then forget the oath they had taken not to submit to the law.
 PICKETS’ WORK
 The pickets have been exerting themselves a great deal. There is no doubt that their exertion has prevented many weak-kneed Indians from going to the Registration Office. Pickets have been posted at Park, Fordsburg, Bramfontein, Doornfontein and at Jeppe stations, as also round the Permit Office. As a result of these arrangements, three Indian workmen coming from Roodepoort were intercepted. They had been compelled by their master to go in for registration. Since they chanced to come upon the pickets, the latter reasoned with them, with the result that they went away, promising that they would lose their jobs rather than take out the new registers.
 Much anger and resentment are felt by the community because Mr. Imam Kamali is misguiding the people and interfering [with their affairs]. Imam Kamali is not an Indian, but a Malay. Everyone feels
 that, being a Malay, he ought not to interfere.
 MONSTER PETITIONlibtech_344_footnote
 This petition has not yet been sent to the Government. It has been held up, pending receipt of the completed forms from one or two places. Signatures of most of the leading Indians have already been obtained. Among the signatories are Messrs Abdool Gani, Hajee Habib, Essop Mia, Dadabhai, Coovadia and other gentlemen. I hope to give more information next week.
 CAN TIME BE GRANTED FOR LEAVING ?
 A question has been asked: If the attack begins in December and people are produced before a magistrate, will they be allowed time [for leaving]? When a person is produced before a magistrate for not taking out the new register, he can ask for time, and it will be for the magistrate to decide what time to give. That is, he may grant anything between one hour and one year. I do not say that a long time will necessarily be allowed, but there is no doubt that the magistrate has the power to allow whatever time he thinks fit. I think asking for time will be humiliating and I shall not advise anybody to do so. Still, those who get frightened of gaol and desire to wind up their affairs can ask for time, and I don’t think the magistrate will refuse to grant it altogether. Everything will depend on the merits of each case, on the magistrate and on the circumstances.
 ESSOP MIA’S BEREAVEMENT
 On Friday night Mr. Essop Mia’s wife passed away in child-bed. This has caused deep sorrow. Mr. Essop Mia wanted to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca with his wife, but was kept back on account of the struggle against the obnoxious law. Meanwhile, this sad event has occurred, which has affected him all the more. I pray to God that He may give fortitude of mind to Mr. Essop Mia.
 BEG’S LETTER
 Mr. Beg continues to write strongly in newspapers. He has written a long letter to Pretoria News in reply to Mr. Smuts’ speech, in which he shows up the unreasonableness of Mr. Smuts.  Mr. Brittlebank too has written a letter to the same paper, in which he condemns the Transvaal Government. Another letter from Mr. Beg also appears in the Leader.
 
 
 “THE SUNDAY TIMES”
 Since the Passive Resistance movement [was mooted], The Sunday Times has been publishing cartoons every week. The cartoon published this week shows the office of the Registration Officers who draw their salaries without doing any work. In his note, the editor asserts that the Government certainly ought to drive  out the “coolies”.
 HAJEE HABIB
Mr. Hajee Habib has arrived at Pretoria from Durban.
 WHY IS WHOLE OF NOVEMBER KEPT BLANK ?
 Some people have asked me whether the Government is so hungry that it will eat up the whole of November. If Indians are to be prosecuted, why should it not start on the first of November? Those who ask this question have not been reading Indian Opinion carefully. Otherwise, my explanation of the notice did include this point. I request the reader to read Indian Opinion henceforth with great care. It will not take many days to do so. Rather, I am convinced that the reader will find in it something worth knowing. After saying this, I reply to the question. The notice issued says that those without new registers on or after December 1 will be prosecuted. The month of October will all be taken up in receiving applications for registers. The Registrar does not give his decision immediately on receipt of an application. He has the authority to order further investigation after receiving it. He is bound to take some time for such investigation. The Government has allowed the month of November to Mr. Chamney for scrutiny of applications. During this period, it will be decided whether those who have made the slavish application should be rewarded with slavery or not. Hence everyone can have the register in December. Some may ask why one whole month is allowed for this in spite of the boycott by the Indian community. The answer is that the Government cannot take notice of the boycott. In case a very large number of applicants turn up on 31st October and flood the Registration Office with applications, the Registrar has to be allowed enough time  to decide on them. For this reason, there is unfortunately a gap in November.
 ATTACK ON PICKETS
 Mr. Alexander, advocate, and Mr. De Villiers, advocate, had each two Konkanis as clients on Tuesday. The Konkanis were charged with staying on without a permit. Both the counsels told Mr. Jordan that the said Konkanis were intimidated by pickets, and therefore could not go to the Registration Office. They were ready to go. Mr.
 Alexander suggested that the court should order the pickets to be removed. Thereupon Mr. Gandhi who was present, said  that  the pickets gave no threats, andthat he himself would take the Konkanis to the Registration Office, if they desired to go there. The matter is now likely to go to the Police Commissioner. Hence the Secretary of the Association has addressed the following letter to him.libtech_345_footnote
 From this incident, the pickets should learn to be careful and do their work with utmost patience. They are to do nothing more than reason with people. When any persons are accompanied by the police, the pickets should not interfere at all. Those who would be slaves need not be obstructed by anyone. It makes me feel ashamed that there are Indians who accuse the pickets of using threats; I feel that it is our misfortune. It has been made clear to every Indian that if he wishes to give his finger-prints, the pickets themselves will conduct him [to the Office]. There will still be twelve days of October left when this letter appears in print. Many interesting things will happen during those days. Every Indian and every picket at Johannesburg has to show courage’ and, at the same time, patience, gentleness and sweetness. What the people are to do is to avoid the Registration Office; the leaders are to explain things to keep up the people’s courage and to put up with monetary loss, and the pickets are to do their duty with patience. There is no need of pressure by pickets. What is required is their presence. There should be a picket at every station and at every point from where an Indian might approach the Office. If the Government should attack the pickets, they must not feel afraid. And it should be remembered that, if anyone is arrested while picketing, he is not to offer bail, and if convicted, he is to go to gaol instead of paying the fine.
 GAVE UP JOB, BUT DID NOT SOIL HANDS
 Messrs Murugan, Armugum, Harry, Venkatapen and Muthu  were employed in a pottery. They were asked to leave their jobs if they did not take out registers. They gave up the jobs, but did not have their hands soiled. Every Indian ought to show such spirit. I regard these men as heroes.
 COWARDS PUT ON VEIL
 Four cowards came from somewhere. They reached the Regis- tration Office unnoticed in a curtained carriage and had their finger- impressions taken. That is how four men honoured the Johannesburg
 
 Office on Wednesday last and applied for the title-deed of slavery.
 NOTE ! NOTE ! NOTE !
 I hope every Indian will realize why the Registration Office is anxious to get the Indians registered by every possible method.
 Mr. Smuts knows that, if the Indians remained firm, it would be impossible to compel them to be registered by sending them to gaol. Nor could he harass thousands of Indians with regard to licences. In the end, he would certainly have to repeal the law. Let every Indian note this and be careful to keep up his courage.

218,"October 	24, 1907",LETTER TO “THE STAR”libtech_346_footnote,"
           TO THE 	EDITOR  THE STAR 	[JOHANNESBURG] 	SIR,          JOHANNESBURG,  October 	24, 1907 
  	I regret that I have to trespass upon your courtesy again with 	reference to the Asiatic Registration Act. Your report of today’s 	happenings on Von Brandis Square bears evident traces of 	inspiration.  	I pass by the description of Indian pickets as “pickets  of 	coolies” as merely an ignorant description of inoffensive and 	honourable men.  	I still maintain that neither the pickets nor any other Indians have 	exceeded the limits of moral persuasion in  preventing registration. 	The Indian referred to by your  reporter was in the witness-box 	today, and certainly said that there was no molestation. He was 	taken hold of by the arm, and, when he said that he wanted to go to 	the registration office, he was allowed to go. That was his own 	evidence, corroborated by his co-registrant and the accused. I do 	not know whether this can by any stretch of imagination be described 	as “roughly collared outside the office”. The men—there were 	two Indians—who were met by the accused Indian, who, by the way, 	was    
 not a picket, did not know what the law was. All they knew was that they got a letter from their master to go to some office in Johannesburg to sign. Why should any exception be taken to people at least informing such men of the trap into which they were about to fall? The opinion of the registration officer that Dr. Mathey’s client must have been intimidated because he did not appear to register may, perhaps, be counter-balanced by another and more probable opinion—that the client has listened to the remonstrances of  his friends, and not been intimidated. I am free to admit that there are many Indians who, but for the pickets, would allowthemselves to be registered. The real thing they fear is not intimidation but Indian public opinion. These are men who know the law to be bad, but who cannot rise superior to their worldly ambition, and they would undoubtedly register if there were no pickets. To mention the priest case in connection with the matter betrays either very great ignorance or equally great prejudice on the part of your reporter, because that case was entirely a religious quarrel, and the priest who was assaulted, in giving his evidence, himself expressed exceeding regret that he had ever filed his affidavit. I do not wish to defend the Dervish who committed the assault, but I fancy that all communities have such men and all are proud of them. They do not live for a nationality but for a principle.

219,"October 26, 1907",LETTER TO “THE TRANSVAAL LEADER”,"
    
 JOHANNESBURG,
 Before October 26, 1907]
[THE EDITOR
THE TRANSVAAL LEADER
JOHANNESBURG]
SIR,
 My Association is grateful to you for your temperate leaderette with reference to alleged intimidation by Asiatic passive resisters. We can have no hesitation in endorsing every word of what you have said against any violence being used in the Indian movement. Our aim in connection with the Asiatic Act has always been to secure redress by suffering ourselves, not by imposing suffering on others.
The paragraph in your columns is evidently inspired. I have no
 hesitation in denying the existence of a reign of terror, unless the very strong feeling against the Act permeating the whole mass of Indians in the Transvaal acts as a reign of terror among those who want to cut themselves adrift from the community and take out certificates under the Act, not because they like the process, but because they hold their pockets to be superior to their honour. I admit the fact that several Asiatics who had left their places of employment with the distinct intention of registering decided not to do so on being accosted by the watchful pickets, who used the effective argument of placing before the registrants the true state of the Law and disabused their minds of the subtle inducements that had been held out to them as a reward for registering. The public can haveno knowledge of the  Herculean efforts being put forth by the Government to induce the community to register. The pickets have never used threats, and constant watch is being kept by the responsible members of the community on the doings of the pickets.
 The information about a Mahomedan priest being assaulted is, unfortunately, true, but he was. not assaulted by a number of Indians. The facts are these: The priest in question is not an Indian, but a Malay. We have in our midst a Dervish, who is a devout follower of the Prophet. He passes all his time in one of the three mosques, and earns his bread, whenever he thinks it worthwhile, by accepting the work of breaking stones on one of the mines. He listens to no one, and is perhaps the most independent-spirited man going in South Africa. Everyone who has seen him and his simple life respects him. When he heard that the Malay priest incited Indians, especially Indian Mahomedans, to violate the sanctity of their solemn oath and  to  submit to the Law, he was enraged. He deliberately walked to the Malay Mosque, met the priest, and entered into an argument with him. He cited a text from the Koran to convince the priest that he, of all the people, should have desisted, especially as he was not an Indian, from interfering with Indian matters and from inducing people to violate the Koranic precepts. Warm words followed, and the unfortunate assault was the result. To charge Indians with responsibility in the matter would, you will admit, be strictly unfair. Many of us have reasoned with the Dervish and have implored him to restrain himself, but he recognises no intervention between himself and his God. To him, needless to say, his home and the jailyard are one and the same thing, and, when reasoned with, he said he was quite willing to appear before the Court and justify his action.
As to the poisoning of the dog, the charge is wicked. I have
 made very careful inquiry, and I can trace no connection between the poisoning and the registration of the master of the dog. Many dogs belonging to Indians have of late been poisoned. It is generally believed that this is done by thieves intending to avoid being detected by the barking of these dogs. It will be terrible if  every  evil occurrence happening to an Indian blackleg were to be debited to Indian passive resisters. No, Sir, we have no desire to resort to questionable methods in order to compel obedience to the wish of the majority of Indians on the part of the minority. How can we who wish to be free as to our movements and, therefore, refuse to submit to the Asiatic Act put restraint upon others who do not think with us? Claiming independence and self-respect for ourselves, we would be false to our ideal if we denied the same measure of independence to others.
 As to the Hindu priest in the reef town mentioned by your reporter, there was certainly no fracas in Germiston. It is perfectly true that the priest has interested himself, like every other Indian priest, whether Hinduor Mahomedan in the Colony, in a question which affects the welfare of the whole Indian community. No Indian prizing his religion can do otherwise. Cannot a priest ask his congregation to look up to God rather than to Mammon in a matter in which there is a choice between God and Mammon?

 "
220,,THE LATE MR. ALEXANDER,"
    
 The news of the death of the late Chief Constablelibtech_347_footnoteof  Durban has come upon the whole Durban community as a painful shock. When he left for Jersey, Mr. Alexander was in the full possession of health, and it was hoped that he would be spared for many a long year and enjoy well-earned rest. It is most painful to recall the fact that the purse presented to the late Superintendent of Police for the Borough of Durban just came in time to enable him to go home. He had
 
 endeared himself so much to the cosmopolitan community of Durban that he will live long in their memory. We tender to the widow our heartfelt sympathy in her loss, which is also the loss  of  the community.

221,,FOR PASSIVE RESISTERSlibtech_348_footnote,"
    
 The principle of State necessity can bind only those men to disobey God’s law who, for the sake of worldly advantages, try to reconcile the irreconcilable; but a Christian, who sincerely believes that the fulfilment of Jesus’ teaching shall bring him salvation, cannot attach any importance to this principle.—Tolstoy
 David Thoreau was a great writer, philosopher, poet, and withal a most practical man, that is, he taught nothing he was not prepared to practise in himself. He was one of the greatest and most moral men America has produced. At the time of the abolition of slavery movement, he wrote his famous essay “On the Duty of Civil Disobedience”. He went to gaol for the sake of his principles and suffering humanity. His essay has, therefore, been sanctified by suffering. Moreover, it is written for all time. Its incisive logic is unanswerable. During the last week of October —a month of sore temptation to Asiatic passive resisters, whose silent suffering has now reached the whole civilised world—we present the following extracts from Thoreau’s essay. The original occupies a little over thirty pages of a pocket book and has been published by Mr. Arthur C. Fifield of 44 Fleet Street, London, in his beautiful “Simple Life” series, at 3d.
 THE EXTRACTS
 I heartily accept the motto: “That government is best which governs least”; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe: “That government is best which governs not at all”; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient.
 After all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands of the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule is not because they are most likely to be in the right nor because this
 
 seems fairest to the minority, but because they are physically the strongest. But a government in which the majority rule in all cases cannot be based on justice, even as far as men understand it.

222,,THE G. O. M.,"
    
 Our readers will be sorry to learn that Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji was unable to attend the magnificent farewell party that was arranged in his honour, owing to sudden illness. The party was attended,  as appears from the full report given in India to hand, by politicians representing all shades of opinion. The absence of any cable news shows that the Grand Old Man has regained his health, and that his abstinent, austere, and temperate life, so eloquently described by Sir Mancherji, has stood him in good stead. We hope that he will long be spared to the country he loves so well.
 Indian Opinion, 26-10-1907
 "
223,,PERVERSITY OF MEMONS,"
    
 There is a saying among us to the effect that those who are about to be destroyed grow perverse first. That is what has happened to the Memons in the Transvaal. Only a very few of them must have remained without the title-deed of slavery. Those who have remained so we hold to be lions. We are not writing this with the intention of giving pain to the persons who have made the evil choice but in the hope that other Indians will take a lesson from their evil deed.
 There is no need for the other communities to get nervous because the Memons have taken out registers. Fear is a sign of cowardice. None need imagine that the Memons, having taken out permits under the obnoxious law, will be able to carry on  their business in the Transvaal without let or hindrance and mint money and that other Indians will have to run away. In fact, though some Memons have become slaves, hundreds of Indians have remained free and for this we must offer prayers of thanks to God. We hold that only an ignorant man will expect the Memons to be able to carry on their business in peace though they might have  taken out the title-deed of slavery. If the other Indians have at all to quit the Transvaal, the whites at least will witness the kicks that the Memons will get. We shudder to think of the fate awaiting them.
 
 However, we believe that, if most of the remaining Indians continue to be firm and are prepared to court arrest, no one will be required to leave the Transvaal. All Indians who have the right to settle in the Transvaal will be able to do so in peace, and the new law will be wrecked. We take it that those who think that it will not be wrecked have no faith in God’s truth and in His most holy justice.  We, therefore, entreat the other Indians to hold the honour of India high and to suffer all hardships rather than submit to the new law. We give below a Gujarati version of the English translation of what is said in the last section of the Holy Koran:
 Say: I submit my self to God who is the King of the whole world. He will save me from the clutches of Satan, of the wicked and of men.
 Let every Indian inscribe these words in his heart. This is the time to save ourselves from the clutches of timid men. The verse quoted above applies to all, be they Hindus, Muslims, Parsis or Christians. For there is only one Truth. And likewise, there is the same God over all. “Gold will always be gold, though it takes on different names when it is made into ornaments.”libtech_349_footnote

 "
224,,DUTY OF TRANSVAAL INDIANS,"
    
 We have often written in the past under this title, and may have to write many times again. We advise every Indian in the Transvaal to read the translation we have given of Mr. Ritch’s letter and of the other papers accompanying it. Every member of the Committee is now with Mr. Ritch. The Hamidia Islamic Society’s letter was brought to the notice even of Mr. Morley. It is being discussed in England. Sir George Birdwood is an old and prominent Indian civil servant of outstanding ability. He has served for many years on the  India Council. He has stated that the fight of the Indians is justified. Mr. Ritch feels puzzled when he finds some of us Indians yielding. In other words, the Committee desires that we fight to the last. If, after our giving so much publicity to the struggle, any Indian submits to
 
 the obnoxious law out of fear, being selfish or greedy of money, we shall take him to be an enemy both of himself and of the country.

 "
225,,INDIAN MERCHANTS OF LADYSMITH,"
    
 Twelve Indian stores in Ladysmith district have been closed down. We think this is very bad news indeed. These merchants had applied again for licences. No licences were issued to them, but they were served with notice that, if the stores were not closed down, they would be prosecuted. Frightened by this notice, the merchants have closed down their stores. We would like to urge them to be bold and open their stores for business. Let the Government, if it so desires, prosecute them for carrying on trade without a licence. After being tried, they will be fined, and when the fine is not paid, their goods will be auctioned. We would particularly advise that they should allow the goods to be sold thus. That will need courage. Who will show that courage, if not brave people? Some may say that, if the goods are auctioned, the people will be ruined. Will not the people be ruined if the stores are closed down? The Government will auction the goods once. Can it do so every time? It may prosecute one trader. Will it prosecute twelve? Supposing it does, will not the Imperial Government intervene? It cannot but do so. If, indeed, it does not, that also will be worth being sure about. If the Indian community unites to give a fight, we are sure that the Natal Dealers’ Licences Act will be wrecked. We advise the leaders of Durban that they should join hands with the merchants of Ladysmith to present a united front. We are convinced that doing this requires courage rather than money. He who is bold enough to give such a fight must remember (1) that the fight can be about old stores, (2) that the stores should be clean, and that (3) the proprietor should have an unblemished record. If such storekeepers give a concerted fight, they cannot but win in the end.

226,,INDIA’S GRAND OLD MAN,"
    
 The revered Dadabhai Naoroji is at present in England. In view of his very old age and his poor health, he had intended to pass the latter part of his life in his own country. Hence, a very big reception was held in London in his honour. Unfortunately, he fell ill on the very day. He could not attend the reception and his  [plan  of]  returning to his country had also to be given up. This news came from England by the last mail, and almost a month has elapsed since then. Till now no telegram has been received, which gives us reasons to believe that India’s Grand Old Man is still safe, and that in all probability he is in good health. More news ought to come by the next mail. Meanwhile, we must all pray to God to give “the Grand- father”libtech_350_footnotelibtech_351_footnotea long life.

 There is a telegram in the papers announcing Superintendent Alexander’s death. We are much grieved at this and believe that every Indian will feel similarly grieved.

At this time, we may recall that the purse he received from the Indian community had proved very useful for his departure for England. Mr. Alexander leaves his widow behind him. We offer our condolences to her.

228,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 MEETING OF HAMIDIA SOCIETY
 As usual, a meeting of the Hamidia Islamic Society took place last Sunday. The hall was packed to the full, and people were in high spirits. Mr. Emam Abdool Cadir presided. Mr. Ram Sundar Pundit made an eloquent speech and gave an account of his meeting with the Indian employees of the Railway. Quoting verses from the holy
 
 Koran, Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar showed that, having taken an oath in the name of God, Muslims could never submit to the law. He said that if Mr. Haloo’s servants encouraged him, they too ought to be boycotted. No member of the community could allow it to be demoralized in any way.
 Mr. Gandhi read out Mr. Hajee Habib’s letter from Pretoria and also the letter received from Klerksdorp. He then pointed out that no one should talk of boycott. But once boycott was decided upon, it should be carried out.
 Mr. Alibhai Akuji said that, if it was decided to boycott all blacklegs, he would arrange to withdraw the Kanmia employees of Mr. Haloo. Mr. M. S. Coovadia said that Mr. Hajee Habib spoke in his letter of some leaders in Johannesburg having secretly got themselves registered. Mr. Coovadia was quite sure that this was not true. He was in favour of boycotting all blacklegs. He said that he  had  flatly refused to buy flour from Mr. S. Butcher, though he would have gained £50 by doing so, because the latter had conveyed to him that he would supply flour only if Mr. Coovadia got himself registered. Mr. Coovadia had thus chosen to suffer a loss.
 Mr. Omarji Sale supported the boycott. Mr. Ebrahim Coovadia read out the article and poem on “Permit Piano” that had appeared in Al Islam. Speaking again, the Moulvi Saheb proposed that the Hamidia Islamic Society should write to the President of the Indian National Congress about the struggle against the law. Something should be done by the community about the refusal of the German Lines to issue first, second and third class tickets for their steamers on the European route. Boycott would be a simple remedy.
 Mr. Ebrahim Coovadia supported the Moulvi Saheb’s proposal to write to the Congress. The meeting was then addressed by some other gentlemen, after which the President made his concluding remarks and terminated the meeting.
 MEETING OF MADRASIS
 The Madrasis held a meeting in Market Street. About a hundred men were present. Mr. Gandhi explained the whole position to them. They all resolved to oppose the law firmly till the end.
 REPORT IN “THE TRANSVAAL LEADER”
 It has been reported in The Transvaal Leader of last Saturday that the Indian community must have been losing strength, for some Indians beat up an Imamlibtech_352_footnotefor having escorted an Indian to the Permit
 
 Office and also poisoned the dog of the Indian who had taken out the permit; and at Germiston, a Hindu priest started a brawl. Commenting upon the report, the Leader says that no Indian leader might have been a party to the assault, etc. Even then if any Indian took to violence, there would be no sympathy left for the Indian community, and damage would be done to it.
 ESSOP MIA’S LETTER
 In reply to this, Mr. Essop Mia has addressed the following letterlibtech_353_footnotelibtech_354_footnote:
Sir,
 My Association is grateful to you for your temperate leaderette with reference to alleged intimidation by passive resisters.

 COMMENTS ON INCIDENT
 This incident deserves serious reflection. There is no doubt that Imam Kamali and Mr. Haloo have made exaggerated and false
 statements to the Registration Officers. Mr. Essop Mia states that it was not true that he was assaulted by a number of Indians. It is obviously unfair to charge the whole Indian community with responsibility for the assault by one Dervish. It is quite improbable that an Indian will poison Mr. Haloo’s dog. We must realize from this incident that there can be no violence at any stage in our struggle. We cannot win by using force. Those who fight with trust in God do not need to resort to violence or similar methods. I for one will never believe that truth can be defeated. The case of Indians is perfectly just, and hence we need not fear the outcome. Those who submit to the obnoxious law will find the new permits reacting of their own on the  bodies  of  the Indians like a medically impure compound of mercury; they will then, indeed, soil their hands.

 Readers will recall that a letter was written to the Police Commissioner, saying that the pickets had not used any force. The following reply has been received from him:libtech_355_footnote
 I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, in respect to the pickets placed on the Registration Office, Von Brandis Square, and I am gratified to receive your assurance that no  intimidation of intending applicants will be countenanced  by  your Association, and I trust that your efforts to see that no molestation occurs will be continued.
 This letter makes it clear that there is nothing wrong in posting pickets. It is only their using force or offering threats that is wrong.
 NO LICENCES IN JANUARY?
 A notice has been published in the Gazette that no licences will be issued in January to those who might not have taken out the new registers. Even then, a notice in writing is being given to individual, leading Indians in every town that if they do not apply for registration before October 31, they will not be able to do so later and no licences will be issued to them in January. A written receipt is also obtained when such a notice is served. What does this mean? It is obvious that the Government is afraid that, if the Indian community does  not submit to the law, no action can be taken against it. They  are,  therefore, getting restless now, and they want to get the people to apply for the title-deeds of slavery by holding out boththreats and inducements. In spite of these visible signs, there are some Indians
 
 who do not take the warning but, weighed down by their greed of money, throw themselves like moths on the flame of the obnoxious law, and get burnt to death. I hope the other Indians will take careful note of these signs and remain firm to the last.
 GERMAN EAST AFRICA LINElibtech_356_footnote
 The information which the Moulvi Saheb gave at the Hamidia meeting, that no tickets other than deck tickets are issued to Indians on steamers plying on the European route should not be treated lightly. It has been causing much friction for some time. As  the Moulvi Saheb pointed out, it is chiefly the pilgrims to Mecca who feel the hardship the most. The remedy is very straight and simple. In the first place, the Line has at different places Indian agents who can make careful arrangements. The other remedy is that of a straight boycott. The Line has a very large Indian clientele. This income can be stopped if the Indian passengers are treated as mere cattle. This requires a big effort among Indians. It will be possible to make arrangements with the British India Steam Navigation Company and other companies. Moreover, the Mogul Line can be got to ply its steamers on this route, as before. There are many such remedies.
 LETTER TO “THE STAR”
 The charge against Indian pickets of using threats is obviously false; it is true, however, that at the instance of Government officials, some whites have been harassing Indians and using threats to make them take out the title-deed of slavery. On this, Mr. Gandhi has written the following letter to The Star:libtech_357_footnote
 Sir—Since the totally inoffensive Indian pickets are being charged, without an iota of proof, with intimidation of those who may wish to take out registration certificates, may I draw public attention to the hollowness of the charge, as also to counter-intimidation, which is a reality?
 A case happened yesterday in which three Indians from Pietersburg were actually offered escort by the pickets, but it was refused. The fact is that an attempt is being made to discredit the pickets by feigning terror, and by asking for police protection. If there is any truth in the charge, why has not anyone been prosecuted? It must be the easiest thing to prove because intimidation is supposed
 
 to take place in broad daylight in Von Brandis Square in the presence of hundreds of passers-by.
 As to counter-intimidation, many Indians believe that Indians possessing permits issued by either Capt. Hamilton Fowle or Mr. Chamney are, under quasi-official pressure, being dismissed for not having submitted to the Registration Act. Whether such pressure exists or not can be seen from a letter from the chief ganger at Germiston, confirming the information received that Indians were dismissed because they would not apply to be registered under the new Act. It causes little wonder, seeing that General Smuts himself has led the way. He has threatened all kinds of punishment—deportation and deprivation of licences at the same time for the same persons. How both can take place I do not know. Physical deportation is not even possible without the immigration measure, which has still to receive Royal sanction. Indians do not mind a fair fight, and, so far as I can see, they are prepared even for an unfair fight, though it will be strictly un-British. Why should the assistance of European employers be called in to force Indians to take out certificates of slavery? That many employers have up to now resisted any such pressure and positively declined to dismiss Indians in their employ, redounds to the credit of both—of the employers because they will not take part in the process of hitting below the belt, of the Indians because they are too valuable and faithful servants to be dismissed.
 I have just learned that the four Indians on whose behalf it was stated that they were intimidated, and who were admittedly without any permits, have today been discharged and assured in the open court that they will receive registration certificates. No doubt slaves deserve their badge in the form of the new registration certificates. In my opinion, those who possess old Dutch passes, as these men are alleged to do, should be treated in the same way as those who have received permits under the Peace Preservation Ordinance, but it is a matter of public knowledge that Mr. Jordan gave all such persons notice to quit the Colony. One such man received notice the same day that the four men above-named stated they would apply for new registration certificates. General Smuts is thus, indeed, finding out the lawful residents from the unlawful ones.
 AID FROM CHINDE
 The Indians of Chinde have sent a telegram of sympathy; not only that, but they have also sent some money along with it. Mr. Ebrahim Hajee Suleman of Chinde writes to the Association as under:libtech_358_footnote
 
 Confirming our wire of the 22nd August 1907, offering our sincere sympathy in the trials of our countrymen in the Transvaal and stronglyrecommending them to be firm in pursuing their resistance policy, we beg to impress upon them the entire necessity of sticking to the same to the last.
 Without detailing to you the proceedings of our meeting held on the 21st August, I would briefly inform our friends there that the proceedings were enthusiastic and the meeting was very well attended.
 When the request was made for drawing up a subscription list, everyone without exception paid according to his means, and  the  list amounted to £33.15.9, which amount, small as it is, we beg to remit you, and to request you to acknowledge same.
 A list of subscribers is attached hereto, and many of them desire the list to be published in Indian Opinion, not because they want to see their names published in the paper, but in the hope that, by seeing the published list, others may also be induced to come forward with help.
It is impossible to turn down this request. I am, therefore, gladly
 sending the list for publication. The following are the names of the contributors:libtech_359_footnote
A letter of thanks has been sent to the Chinde Association.
 DOG’S COURAGE
 The pickets here have bought a picture by a well-known painter. It is very striking and is such as will inspire every Indian with courage. It shows a dog and two girls. The two girls have removed their shoes and one of them is pulling the dog with a string round its neck, and the other is pushing it from behind. But the brave animal does not budge an inch from the place. That is passive resistance. The painter has also named his picture “Passive Resister”. The picture shows the dog strong enough to bite the girls, if it wants to. Though obstinate, the girls are mere children. But the dog merely does not want to move from its place. It says, as it were: ‘I shall never be your slave. I shall not move just because you pull me with a string or push me from behind. If I go with you of my own free will, that will be a different matter. But you will not succeed with force. Likewise, I too shall not use force against you.’ Such is the nature of the Indian struggle. We do not need to use force against anyone. But we shall not give up the pledge we have taken.
 
 
 LIST OF BLACKLEGS
 I give below an up to-date list that has come into my hands of blacklegs, or black-faces or “piano players”, call them what you will:libtech_360_footnoteI feel ashamed to give the list, but do so from a sense of duty,
 suppressing the feeling of shame. Mr. Hasam Mamad named here was chief picket at Pietersburg. It is a matter of no small regret that he allowed himself to be stamped with a black mark  and  accepted slavery. They say it was Mr. Abou Aiyab who took the initiative, but he was nomore than a pawn in Mr. Khamisa’s game of chess. Why therefore blame him? These gentlemen felt so ashamed that they were reluctant to accept the register with number 1. Thereupon,  the Registrar gave No. 137 to the first. That Indians, even in spite of such absurdities should feel afraid, is in itself a sign of our degradation. It can be seen from the list that the large majority of them are Memons, some Konkanis, and the rest—a Gujarati Hindu and two or three Madrasis. The list does not include Mr. Haloo and about  five  Konkanis who have applied at Johannesburg. Not many days are now left.  Everything  will  be  public  in  due  course.libtech_361_footnotelibtech_362_footnoteThis  list  has   been obtained with much difficulty. It was supplied to the Pretoria Chamber of Trade as a matter of favour. But once a secret passes from one person to another, it soon spreads everywhere. What wonder, then, that the written list supplied to the Chamber was passed on to others? And if it could be given to others, why should poor Indian Opinion be excluded? If anyone were to suppose from this that I got the names from the Chamber, it would be an error. Those who want to know how I got [the names] have to go unsatisfiedlibtech_363_footnotelibtech_364_footnotefor the time being at least.
 KLERKSDORP JOURNAL
 This journal makes an amusing comment on the law. How is it, the paper asks, the concern of a mischief-monger like Mr. Gandhi? So far as he is concerned, he will pick his briefcase and go elsewhere. But those who hold property should certainly become slaves. For the Government had already declared that Indians would be deported, and that no licences would be issued. The editor of the Klerksdorp paper gives this advice as an impartial observer. He has forgotten that people acquire wealth not to be slaves, but to enjoy freedom. Hanging from the belt, the sword is an ornament; but thrust into the chest, it will cause death. Similarly, wealth brings honour to men of reputation and
 
 status, but to slaves it is like a sword thrust into the chest. Those who have earned wealth have the right to part with it, and that is the right which the Indian community is using. The whites who offer such wise counsel have themselves often sacrificed their possessions for the sake of their country and their honour, and have earned it again with equal ease. What wonder then that for the sake of its honour and its religion, the Indian community should kick off its wealth?
 VERY IMPORTANT CASE
 I referred earlier to the licence case against Mr. Dulabh Vira at Roodepoort. The magistrate showed sympathy for Mr. Dulabh Vira, but gave his judgment against him. There were cases against two persons. One was against his servant and the other was against himself. Mr. Dulabh Vira did not hold a licence. The servant was also prosecuted because he had sold the goods. The magistrate held that though Mr. Dubabh Vira was entitled to a licence, he had no right to keep the shop running since the Receiver had not issued a licence to him. The servant was also held guilty because he had sold the goods and so he was considered to have carried on trade. He was not sentenced. Mr. Dulabh Vira was fined ls.
 In the appeal to the Supreme Court, the following grounds were advanced:
  In 	selling the goods, 	the employee 	has committed 	no offence. 	The employer 	alone can be 	found guilty under the law.  Since 	it cannot 	be held 	to be the 	fault of 	Mr. Dulabh 	Vira that 	the Receiver 	had not issued 	the licence 	to him, 	though he 	had applied 	for it 	and was entitled 	to it, 	no sentence 	should have been 	passed against him. In 	deciding the 	appeal, the 	Court held that the 	law could 	punish the owner 	of a shop 	trading without a 	licence, but 	not his employee. 	The employee 	is therefore 	free, and 	nothing can 	be done 	to him. 
 Mr. Dulabh Vira [according to the Court] had no right to run the shop without a licence. He was asked to apply to the Receiver again, and if the Court found that the Receiver was deliberately refusing the licence to him, it would award costs against the Receiver and also damages to the appellant.
 This is a very important judgment. It opens up many possibilities. It is a judgment which will hearten the people engaged in the Transvaal struggle. Many Indians were afraid that, in the absence of licences in January, their shops would have to be closed down. But that fear is now dispelled. Only the owner of an establishment is liable to be sentenced. The law does not provide for forcible closure of a
 
 shop and the servants can continue to work in it. There is therefore no question of closing down. Only the owner of the store will have to suffer the hardship—according to me, the privilege—of being gaoled.  I think this is a very valuable judgment.
 It is very encouraging that damages and costs can be awarded against the Receiver.
 If, after this decision, even a single Indian merchant is to yield, it can only be said that we deserve the obnoxious law.
 SHAHJI SAHEB FINED
 Imam Kamali had filed a complaint against Shahji Saheb for assault, which came up for hearing on Wednesday. In giving evidence, Imam Kamali stated that he was sorry for having made the affidavit. There was a dispute between the two on a religious  point  in connection with the question of law, during which Shahji Saheb dealt him a blow with a stick. The Imam for his part did not now desire any sentence to be passed [on Shahji Saheb]. In his deposition, Shahji Saheb admitted having dealt a blow, as stated above. The court-room was packed to capacity. The magistrate sentenced Shahji Saheb to a fine of £5 or imprisonment for seven days. The latter flatly refused to pay the fine, but, much against his desire, Mr. Gulam Mahomed Kadodia paid the fine on his behalf.
 MEETING OF BRITISH INDIAN ASSOCIATION’S COMMITTEE
 A meeting of the Association and the Anti-Indian-Law Fund took place at 12 noon on Wednesday. Mr. Essop Mia presided. Mr. Gandhi said that Mr. Dulabh Vira’s case should now be taken up by the community; that arrangement should be made to maintain the South Africa British Indian Committee; and that, in view of the uncertain situation facing the community, it would be better to vest the moneys of the Anti-Indian-Law Fund under his (Mr. Gandhi’s) control. After Messrs Omarji, Naidoo, Ahmed Moosaji and Fancy had spoken on the subject, it was unanimously resolved that:
  The 	South Africa British 	Indian Committee be 	maintained for 	one year, and 	that Natal be 	requested to 	help meet the 	expenditure for the 	first six months.  Mr. 	Dulabh Vira’s case be 	taken up 	by the Association 	and expenses 	incurred up to £20.  The 	account in 	the name 	of the 	Anti-Indian-Law Fund 	be closed, 	and the Fund be 	placed under Mr. 	Gandhi’s control.

TO
 SIR WILLIAM WEDDERBURN CHAIRMAN
 BRITISH COMMITTEE OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS LONDON
[SIR,]
 I beg to draw your  attention to the crisis that is  being approached here in connection with the Asiatic Registration Act. The last day for registration is the 31st instant, after which date, except in special cases, the Government will not entertain applications for registration certificates under the law. With the exception of the Memon community, Indians, as a rule, have refrained from going to the Registration Office and, out of 13,000 permit-holders, only 250 have applied to come under the law. This shows the  strength of feeling. The mode of seeking redress is for us to suffer all the consequences of a breach of the law. Some who are very large merchants are likely to lose everything they possess. Many  have begun to feel the pinch already, as European wholesale houses have ceased to give credit unless Indian merchants can produce registration certificates. Poor Indians have lost their employment, and, yet, there is the same firmness and opposition against the law.
 In the opinion of my Association, the question is of first-class Imperial importance and national importance for India. My Association, therefore, hopes that the matter will be warmly taken up at the forthcoming Congress, and will also receive that general attention in India which it deserves; and with this end in view, my Association respectfully requests your active sympathy and encouragement. My Association feels that, apart from your official position, every Indian looks up to you as one of the greatest
 
 well-wishers of India, and I hope that in our present struggle, too, you will guide Indian thought in India as to what may appear desirable.

 JOHANNESBURG,
 November 1, 1907
TO
 THE COLONIAL SECRETARY PRETORIA
SIR,
 I have the honour to forward, by parcel post, the petition of the British Indians throughout the Transvaal, in connection with the Asiatic  Registration  Act,  and  herewith  a  copy  of   the   instructionslibtech_367_footnoteissued to the canvassers.
 When the forms were distributed through the Colony, the letter addressed to the Government on behalf of certain Indians asking for a modification of the regulations framed under the Act, was still unanswered and the letter not withdrawn. But though since  then  Messrs Stegmann, Esselen, and Roos’ clients have not received a reply to their satisfaction, and although they have therefore withdrawn the letter, the committee of my Association desires me to forward the petition, as it embodies the sentiments of those who have signed it. In the humble opinion of my Association, the petition forms a complete vindication of the attitude adopted by it, and shows that it is representative of the vast majority of Indians in the Colony. The petition has been ready for some time, but my Association delayed its presentation, in order to test the action of the community during the period that the Registration Office remained open in Johannesburg.
 There are 4,522 signatories to the petition, and they are drawn from 29 towns, villages, and districts in the Transvaal. The following is the analysis according to the centres: Johannesburg, 2,085; Newclare,
 
 108; Roodepoort, 136; Krugersdorp, 179; Germiston, 300; Boksburg,
129; Benoni, 91; Modderfontein, 51; Pretoria, 577; Pietersburg and
Spelonken, 90; Vereeniging, 73; Heidelberg, 66; Balfour, 14;  Stander
 ton, 123; Volksrust, 36; Wakkerstroom, 12; Piet Retief, 3; Bethal, 18; Middelburg, 29; Belfast, Machadodorp, and Waterval, 21; Barberton, 68; Potchefstroom, 114; Ventersdorp, 12; Klerksdorp, 41;  Christiana,
24; Lichtenburg, 7; Zeerust, 59; Rustenburg, 54; Ermilo, 2.
 There are in the Transvaal Hindus, Mahomedans, Christians, and Parsees from India, and the Mahomedans are divided into three sections, i.e., Surtis, Konkanis, and Memons; the Hindus into Gujarati, Madrassi, and Northerners, commonly called Calcutta people. In order to avoid a separate classification for the Sikhs and the Pathans, they have been included among the Northerners, if Hindus, and among the Surtis, if Mahomedans. The Christians have not been separately classified as they are nearly all Madrassis, and are not more than 200 in all. The following, then, is the religious  and  provincial classification: Surtis, l,476; Konkanis, 141; Memons, 140; Gujarati Hindus, l,600; Madrassis, 991; Northerners, 157; Parsees, 17.
 I may mention that, with the exception of the Memons, there are hardly any abstentions, but the task of reaching every Indian in the isolated parts of the Transvaal—as, for instance, farms, etc.—has been beyond my Association during the time that was allotted for the canvassing of signatures. Canvassers, who were in all cases responsible and representative men, have reported that a large number of Indians have already left the Transvaal, owing to the struggle that the community is passing through. It is common knowledge that nearly 13,000 permits have been issued to British Indians under the Peace Preservation Ordinance, and approximately that number of Indians were resident in the Transvaal when unfortunately the struggle commenced in September of last year. To-day the British Indian population of the Transvaal, according to the information at the disposal of my Association, does not at the outside exceed 8,000, but it is probably nearer 7,000 than 8,000. My Association is aware that, owing to pressure having been exerted by wholesale merchants or other similar causes, a few of the Memons and others, not exceeding 30 signatories, have recanted, and applied for registration under the Act. Moreover, according to the information received by my Association, no more than 350 Indians have applied for registration throughout the Transvaal during the period that the registration has been proceeding, namely, July 1 to October 31, and that 95 per cent of these applicants are drawn from the Memon section.
 In conclusion, my Association begs to draw the attention of the Government to the intensity of the feeling of the community
 represented by my Association against the Asiatic Law Amendment Act. In taking up the attitude the community has felt called upon to adopt, there has been no intention of defying either the Government or the laws of the country, but a sense of the wrong done to the community by the Act and all it implies has compelled British Indians to prepare for undergoing a course of suffering which passive resistance, as understood by British Indians, involves.

[THE EDITOR
THE TRANSVAAL LEADER
JOHANNESBURG]
SIR,
 In your leading article in today’s issue on the Asiatic Registra- tion Act, you have imputed to the British Indian Association a state- ment to the effect that nearly the whole of the 400 men said to have been registered had no right to be in the Transvaal. I am not aware of any such statement having been made by any official of the Associa- tion. I know that some of our pickets did make some such statement, but that was mere bravado. The chief picket, Mr. Naidoo, immediately corrected it, but the correction did not appear in your report. The official statement made by the Association is that four men at least, who, according to the interpretation of the law put upon it by the Government, have no right to be in the country, have applied for and probably received registration certificates. The Association does not even consider these men to be not entitled to their certificates.
 If the Government keep the office open for receiving applications, I must respectfully decline to consider it as a graceful concession, as it would be, in the opinion of the majority of Indians, a confession of weakness on the part of the Government. The British Indian Association, in all humility and in obedience to a higher call, has challenged the Government to do its worst. We do not require the
 registration pin-pricks, and, if the vigilance of the pickets has kept Indians away from what they consider a plague-spot, the same vigilance will be exercised in Pretoria also.
 You ask what can be gained by the Indian opposition in the teeth of General Smuts, threat and the refusal of intervention by the Imperial Government. So far as I am aware, in the last resort, Indians have not pinned their faith either to intervention from Downing Street or to recognition of the principles of humanity by General Smuts. Though the effort now being made by the Indian community is undoubtedly calculated, if successful, to give them a status in the colony, they are fully aware that they may lose their all  in  the  struggle. But, if that happens, which I do not believe, they will at least have gained a soul, and put that gain in one scale and all that General Smuts and his Act can give to the Indian community in the other, and  I have no hesitation in asking my countrymen to reject at all costs the latter. You will then see that, while we take advantage of all that the law may give us, the sanctioning of the Immigration Restriction Bill or any other harsher measure will not turn the community from the straight and narrow path. If it does— and I do not say that it will not—then every Indian knows that there is a precipice on either side.

 SIR WILLIAM WEDDERBURN CHAIRMAN
 BRITISH COMMITTEE OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS LONDON
[SIR,]
 My Society has been moving very actively in connection with the Asiatic Registration Act. It is hardly necessary for me to state that in South Africa we have no racial differences. Hindus, Mahomedans, Parsis, Christians, belonging to the different Provinces, join hands and work for the common good. In some respects the Asiatic Registration Act peculiarly affects Indian Mussulmans. We have appealed to all parties and all sections, and my Society, therefore, ventures to appeal
 to you as the mouthpiece in England of the Indian National Congress, and trusts that the question of the Transvaal Registration Act will be put in the forefront of the subjects to be dealt with by the Congress, as distinguished from the general South African question. As you are aware, we are adopting what may, perhaps, be termed heroic measures, in order to meet the special difficulty in the Transvaal. The other legislation in South Africa can be lived down and has been, so far, tolerated, but the Transvaal Act is intolerable. Under the other South African legislation, Indians have not felt called upon, by  way  of protest, to lose all rather than submit, but, under the Transvaal Act, that step has been considered and rendered  absolutely  necessary.  The other South African legislation deprives us, as a rule, of the avenues to wealth; the Transvaal Registration Act deprives us of our manhood and reduces us to a status almost of slavery. And, in so much as this question affects Mahomedans specially, it will, perhaps, be graceful on the part of the National Congress to give the matter of the Transvaal special prominence. By the end of December, probably, many Indians may have even suffered imprisonment for a principle, so that a very acute stage will have been reached by the time the Congress meets.

 "
233,,SMUTS’ BRAVERY(?),"
    
 Many Indians, like women, are unnerved at the thought that General Smuts is a man who will always do what he says he will. We stated last week that that gentleman withdrew the Regulations pertaining to the closure of shops no sooner than  these  were published. During the week the Regulations remained gazetted, many white shopkeepers put up a fight against them. General Smuts cooled down and withdrew them within ten days of their publication. In the same way, that gentleman withdrew the Beer Bill and the Kaffir Law. The Shop Regulations were withdrawn for fear of the Transvaal whites, and the other two laws were withdrawn because of the strong opinion against them in England.
 These three instances deserve to be carefully noted by Indian friends. They indicate that General Smuts is certainly afraid of brave people; but as some effeminate husbands are brave only in respect of
 their wives, so General Smuts shows himself brave in respect of those who panic before him, that is, to those who are like women. He has to fear the white businessmen because the power he holds depends on them. Why should he fear the Indians? Indians change their attitudes ten times a day, like women changing their dress. The same Indian may be a picket and yet accept the title-deed of slavery; the same Indian may accept a presidentship to oppose the law, and then sign an affidavit and wear the slavish sari; the same Indian taking an oath in the name of God will put down his signature with one pen that he will not submit to the law, and then with a second pen say that he must have slavery. Now, say, why should General Smuts be afraid? It is still possible under one condition, namely, that those who are yet not involved should continue fighting against General Smuts till the end, even to the point of being ruined. Then we shall see if the obnoxious law does not go the way of the Beer Bill! Never and nowhere in this world was spectacular success achieved without a struggle.

		INDIANS","
    
 “THE LAW IS UNWISE AND UNJUST”
 In The Friend of Bloemfontein of the 24th instant, there is a leader in support of the Transvaal Indians which runs as follows:libtech_370_footnote
 From Pretoria comes the report that the resistance of the British Indians to the Registration Act is believed by the authorities to be weakening. The grounds for the belief are stated to be that some 48 Indians, a few of them prominent members of their community, have applied to be registered in Pretoria. At Johannesburg, however, where the mass of the British Indians resides, there have been only 16 applications, of which but one was made by a local Indian, the others coming from the outside districts. To our mind, the above figures are not nearly so significant as the fact, stated further on in the report, that
 100 Indians, presumably from the Transvaal, were to  embark tomorrow from Durban for India. The British Indians in South Africa might be expected like any other community, whether white or coloured, to develop under pressure of persecution their own percentage of cowards. What claims our notice is the fact not that two or three scores of them have submitted weakly to a law which they consider degrading and unjust, but that a large number prefer to keep their self-respect at the price of leaving the country. The action of the Transvaal Government in this matter has been morally wrong and diplomatically foolish. Those British Indians who have protested against the Registration Ordinance are British Indians who possess a full and admitted legal right to live in the Transvaal, a right derived from long previous residence. The Government has decided, without the slightest justification so far as we can see, to make their further enjoyment of that right conditional on their submission to a law which stigmatises them as serfs or felons. It is the simple fact that the finger-print method of registration has hitherto been confined in the Transvaal to convicts and indentured Chinamen. Some may think that the race inferiority of the British Indians makes it excusable to treat them in this fashion. If they were an inferior race, we have no right to mark our superiority by oppressing them, but is it so sure that they are inferior? We have Indian regiments which rank in their soldierly qualities with the flower of our army. Our universities frequently see
 
 their best prizes carried off by Indian students. In capacity for abstract thought and insight into the mystery of things, the Westerns still sit as children at the feet of the Easterns. If capacity  for  trade  and commerce be made the test, it is generally admitted that the average white man has in these no chance against the competition of the average Asiatic. In this last fact we have unquestionably  the  true reason for the way in which the British Indians in the Transvaal are being treated. No doubt, we possess as a white race the military advantage over the Asiatics, but one of the anxious questions which agitate the minds of European statesmen is the question how long that advantage is going to last. Possibly the Asiatic myriads will within a few years wake from their torpor of centuries and overwhelm the West as they have done more than once before. Should they not do so, it will not be because the Transvaal Government is not helping to arouse them. Every British Indian sent back to his own country by  the injustice of the Transvaal Government will take with him an ineradicable sense of wrong, and it is odds if he becomes an agitator and foments dislike of the white man’s rule. We know that the last thing the Transvaal Government wished to do was to add to the anxieties of the Imperial Government. Yet the fact is it is getting rid of its own share of the Asiatic problem in a manner which complicates and increases the Imperial Government’s share. For this reason we consider the Registration Act unwise as well as unjust. We do not suppose that under pressure from India the British Government will bring pressure to bear on the Transvaal Government, demanding the revision of Asiatic legislation in that colony, or, perhaps (as some fear) the opening of our doors to the entrance of British Indians. The old country is exceedingly patient of the procedure of her colonies and leaves them to their own way, even when her own interests are hurt thereby, nor does she absolve herself of the liability of defending them with her fleet at her own cost. All this the Transvaal Government recognizes. General Botha’s Cabinet is personally the friends of the Imperial Government but yet, by means of its Asiatic measure, it is getting their friends into trouble. Surely there was a better way?
 Having written thus much, let us suggest the proper alternative. This would have been to pass in the first place a law forbidding the future immigration of Asiatics, no matter under what pretexts. In the second place, it would have been proper to lay down rules to which all Asiatics in the Colony would have to conform as the condition of their continued residence therein. But if there were any Asiatics who preferred to leave rather than submit to these rules, and could prove that they suffered damage by leaving, they should receive liberal compensation. Suppose the whole Indian population of the Transvaal
 had asked the Government to buy it out, the cost would have been cheap compared to that of an Indian mutiny, and, perhaps the  Imperial Government, as interested in a just solution of the difficulty, would have consented to share the cost. To some extent the Imperial Government is responsible as having made the case of the Indians in the Transvaal a pretext for the late war. Unquestionably, the Asiatic problem is one which a federated South Africa will have to take up as  a whole. Natal is even more vitally interested than the Transvaal, since she cannot do without Indian labour. Her solution of the difficulty may be, as we have several times suggested, to mark off a portion of her territory as an Indian pale, within which all British Asiatics will have equal rights with Europeans, but outside which their presence will not be permitted in South Africa. We have the most perfect right to keep our country for ourselves and to decline to be ousted by alien races. We have no right to inflict insult or loss on individual members of those races.

236,,MEETING OF LONDON MUSLIMS,"
    
 There is interesting news in the papers that Muslims in London are meeting to pass a resolution protesting against the new law. They comprise many communities and belong to different nations. They include Europeans, too. Their meeting cannot but have some effect. Our Muslim brethren should realize from this that they need to become more alert and carry on the Transvaal struggle with greater courage.

237,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 
 LAST WEEK
 Only a few days of October are left. By the time this letter appears in print, the “Plague Office” will have left this place. Indians have remained strong at least up to the time of writing this. Except for the Memons and some Konkanis, everyone has maintained his spirit. I said “the Memons”, but there is reason to hope that five or six Memons at Pietersburg and two or three at Piet Retief will partly save the honour of their community. As for the rest, even at places where
 there were only one or two who had kept back, they ran about feverishly, and showing little concern for the community, for their honour or for their pledge, filed affidavits, true or false, and made themselves safe by donning the prize-cloak of slavery, which makes them feel like princes. There is a proverb among us that when the sky itself goes to pieces, no mending is possible. When the President of Pietersburg himself chooses to become a slave and advises others to do likewise, whom among the Memons can we blame?
 Then there is Mr. Hajee Cassim who has adopted a novel course. He felt that it would be a great sin to make an affidavit that he had not applied for the permit out of fear. He therefore wrote to General Smuts, saying that they had expected that some modifications would be made by him, and that, since that was not done, they now wished to register themselves, for which they sought the General’s permission. General Smuts has not yet got enough slaves and he  cannot  do without them so, by way of favour, he has ordered that Mr. Hajee Cassim and his friends may be registered without an affidavit. That brings the chapter of the Memons to a close. It remains to be seen what happens to other Indians.
 HAMIDIA ISLAMIC SOCIETY
 A meeting of the Society took place as usual. Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar made a speech that brought tears to the eyes of some. Citing many instances from the Koran, he showed that submis- sion to the law would mean betrayal of their faith. Mr. Gandhi gave a brief account of his interview with the Police Commissioner and sugg- ested that they should take the pickets off for one day so that the Gov- ernment might be convinced [that no force was being used]. Speaking again, Moulvi Saheb suggested that one person should spe-cially go to India to rouse the country. Mr. Coovadia stated that the police had taken the fingerprints of Mr. Saleji’s Malay wife and their child of two years, and that at Durban Mr. Burgess had torn off the permits of so-me Hindus. Mr. Omarji pointed out that in November the leaders sho-uld tour every village and explain the whole situation to  the people.
 ASIATIC EATING-HOUSES
 The Municipality has framed Regulations for Indian and Kaffir eating-houses. These Regulations contained a clause requiring the nomination of European deputies in the event of the owners being absent. The British Indian Association has protested against this and has addressed the following letter to the Government:libtech_371_footnote
 
 My Association has noticed in the Municipal Minutes Bye-Laws with reference to Asiatic eating-howes, one clause of which requires the owners of these Asiatic eating-houses to appoint as their deputies white men only. A general notice, too, has been issued to owners of these eating-houses by the Municipality, informing them that “as it is probable that the nomination of a deputy will be required by the Committee in every case, applicants should forward to the undersigned, without delay, the name of such deputy.” The notice shows that it is the intention of the Municipal Council to insist on a white deputy being appointed in each case.
 Asiatic eating-houses are very few in number, and both Mahomedans and Hindus would have religious objections to a European deputy having anything to do with their foodstuff. Moreover, these eating-houses have hardly more than ten customers on an average per day, and it is not possible for them to afford the expense of European or other deputies.
 In the humble opinion of my Association, the proposed Bye-Law will impose a very great hardship on the few Asiatic eating-house keepers. My Association, therefore, ventures to trust that sanction for the Bye-Law will be withheld.
 There is reason to fear that this law will be passed. It means that Hindus and Muslims will be served by the whites. This is the utmost limit of oppression. I for one cannot help thinking that, if we accept defeat in our struggle against the new law, Indians will lose their religion and dignity and everything else.
 SOME RUMOURS
 A rumour has been spread that Mr. Gandhi has got several leaders of Johannesburg registered in secret and that he has also registered himself. The reader can decide for himself what weight to attach to this rumour. They go to the extent of even saying that this has been encouraged by General Smuts. If that is so we can say that General Smuts, having grown nervous, is now clutching at a straw.
 There is another rumour that General Smuts will definitely have all those without registers in December packed off by train. He has arranged with a Minister of Natal to have such persons carried by train to the Point and from there they will be directly forced into the steamer and deported to India. This story is without any foundation, for it is false. No law has been passed yet for forcible expulsion. Mr. Leonard has stated his opinion that there is no law in the Transvaal under which an Asiatic who does not take out a register can  be expelled by force. Moreover, it should be realized that, if any such authority had been provided for in the obnoxious  law,  the Government would never have gone out of its way to include such a clause in the Immigration Bill. It is certain that the Government has no
 authority to use force for expulsion. Besides, who can force anyone into a steamer if he has the right to remain in Natal?
 There is a third rumour that the majority of Indians in Johannesburg have already got themselves registered. Leaders from Ermilo, Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom have arrived here to inquire if this is true. They found the real situation to be quite encouraging. Except for Mr. Haloo, Mr. Mahomed Shahboodeen, Mr. Abdul Gafur and two or three others, no one in Johannesburg has got himself registered and, even from outside, only fifteen persons came to get their faces blackened. The leaders were quite reassured to find this.
 PRETORIA IS WEAK
 The earlier fear that Pretoria was the weakest of all has now been justified. Mostly it is there that people have got themselves registered. Almost all Memons having been registered, other communities have also become restless. They are thinking what the remaining people should do. But one fails to understand what there is to think about. It should be enough for everyone that the law is bad and that we have taken an oath to resist it.
 REGRETTABLE INCIDENT
 The incident of Shahji Saheb’s attack on Imam Kamali is yet fresh in memory. And now he has attacked Mr. Mahomed Shahboodeen. On Monday, at 10 o’clock  in the morning Mr. Mahomed Shahboodeen was in the Market Square, when Shahji Saheb went up to him and rebuked and assaulted him for having got himself registered. One of his fingers was seriously injured. Some of the Jews who were present intervened; otherwise the injury would have been more serious. People have been very much upset by this. Everyone feels sorry. Mr. Essop Mia and Mr. Gandhi went to Mr. Shahboodeen to express their regret. Mr. Mahomed Shahboodeen does not intend to take out proceedings against Shahji Saheb. However, as soon as the Police Commissioner heard of this, he made enquiries. He has called for a statement from Mr. Shahboodeen which he has refused to submit. The leaders are remonstrating with Shahji Saheb. Everyone has felt sad at this incident.
 I have stated more than once in these columns that, if any violence is used by the community in this struggle, we shall find it difficult to win. Use of force has no place in this struggle. Those who play on the pianolibtech_372_footnotecannot be defended. There is no doubt that such persons are traitors. But they are to be won over by persuasion and
 
 argument. Even if they remain obstinate, we cannot afford to use force against them. It will do us much harm if we do so. No one can argue with Shahji Saheb. His is an exceptional case. But all Indians must realize that our object can be attained only by their acting with courage but never by violence. What will it matter if those who do not feel humiliated by the law get themselves registered? I at least believe that so long as the majority remain firm, no harm will have been done.
 SOME QUESTIONS
 It has been asked whether, in the absence of the proprietor, the manager can get a licence or not. The question has been answered by the Supreme Court in the case of Rama Makan: the answer is that he can get the licence. There is another question, namely, whether it is necessary for Indians here to give a thumb-impression in a power of attorney. It is obvious that in this case the thumb-impression has to be given. All these questions have meaning for those who wish to submit to the law. Those who do not submit to the law will fight it by carrying on trade without a licence, and in the end will get the law repealed.

 There have been some additions to the list given by me last time, which I publish here with regret:

 BRAVE MULTANI MERCHANT
The Star has published the following advertisement:
 PASSIVE RESISTER (WON’ T REGISTER) Unreserved sale of Maltese Lace, Teneriffe Goods, Japanese and Indian Silks, etc., etc.
 This advertisement has been inserted by a brave Multani trader. He prefers imprisonment to registration. He has taken this step to wind up his business and hold himself ready for anything that the Government may do.

 OFFICERS’ DESPERATE EFFORTS
 The officers are now reduced to making such desperate efforts to secure applications that their conduct becomes ridiculous. One instance of this is provided by the case of two Chinese pickets arrested last week. It was stated in evidence before the court that one police constable (acting as a tool in the hands of the Registration Officer) had abused a Chinese picket on two different occasions, and that he had also tried to manhandle him. The magistrate acquitted the accu- sed, and set them free. As a result of the conduct of the whites and the courage of the Chinese as revealed in this case, many whites found themselves being drawn in their hearts to the side of the passive resisters.

 JOHANNESBURG,
 November 4, 1907
 [SHRI RASH BEHARI GHOSH PRESIDENT-ELECTlibtech_374_footnote
INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS
SIR,]
 I beg to draw your attention and that of the Congress to the pre- sent critical position of British Indians in the Transvaal in connection with the Asiatic Registration Act. British Indians have been informed that the last day for receiving applications for registration under that obnoxious measure is the 30th instant, whereafter the Government will not entertain applications for registration, except in special cases. You will, probably, already have learnt that, with the exception of a very small section of the community, practically the entire  Indian population has refused to register under the new law. My Association claims that, to date, there have not been more than 350 applications for registration out of a total of 13,000 permit-holders. From this you will be able to gauge the intensity of the feeling in this matter.
 You will have learnt that our method of endeavouring  to redress the wrong that has been done us is that of passive resistance. We haveresolved to suffer all the consequences of a breach of the law. Many of us have already lost heavily, many more stand to lose everything they possess. Several European wholesale houses have even
 
 gone so far as to stop credit unless Indian merchants can produce registration certificates issued under the new law. Many Indians employed as servants or labourers have accepted dismissal  at  the hands of their employers rather than register themselves.
 As you will be well aware, the British Indian community in the Transvaal is composed of Mahomedans, Hindus, Christians and Parsis; Madrassis, Gujaratis, Sikhs, Pathans, Hindi men, and men from Calcu- tta, all of whom have combined in the great work of resisting an iniq- uitous law which threatens to rob every Indian of his material wealth and to destroy that self-respect which he has snatched from the ruin with which he has been threatened by previous oppressive legislation.
 My Association approaches the Congress at this moment in the hope that the Transvaal Registration Act will be put in the forefront of the subjects to be dealt with by the Congress and made the main plank of its platform as distinguished from the general South African question. Today, there is no other South African question than the awful position of the British Indians in the Transvaal. What happens to us today will happen to our brethren everywhere in South Africa tomorrow. Nay, we consider that ours is a question of first-class importance to the Empire and of national importance to India; for what the South African Colonies succeed in enforcing against us here, other dominions of the Empire will practise against our brethren elsewhere. It may be said that we are adopting heroic measures in order to meet a special difficulty in the Transvaal; but we regard ourselves as the representatives, in this country, of our Motherland, and it is impossible for us, as patriotic Indians, to keep silence under an insult that is levied against our race and our national honour. No other legislation in South Africa has attacked us so fiercely on these points, but the Transvaal Asiatic Registration Act is intolerable. All other South African legislations deprive us, as a rule, of the avenues to wealth. The Transvaal Registration Act deprives us of our manhood and reduces us to the status of slavery. By the end of December, probably many Indians may have even suffered imprisonment for a principle, whilst the 1st of January will witness a general refusal to issue trade licences to Indians who have refused to register under the new law, so that a very acute stage will have been reached by the time the Congress meets. We hold that our movement of passive resistance merits the approval of all religious men, of all true patriots, of all men of commonsense and integrity. It is a movement so potent as to com- pel the respect of our adversaries by virtue of our very non-resistance,
 of our willingness to suffer; and we are the more firm in our determi- nation to offer this opposition, because we consider that our example, on a small scale in this Colony, whether successful or unsuccessful, may well be adopted by every oppressed people, by every oppressed individual, as being a more reliable and more honourable instrument for securing the redress of wrongs than any which has heretofore been adopted.

239,"November 	6, 1907",LETTER TO THE PRESSlibtech_375_footnote,"
           [JOHANNESBURG, 
   [SIR,]  November 	6, 1907]   You 	publish in today’s issue of your paper what purports to be 
  	an authorised explanation given to your Pretoria correspondent of 	the present position of the Government in regard to the 	administration of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act. My Association 	regrets to find, how- ever, that that report is so strangely full of 	misapprehensions and miss- tatements, that a doubt must arise as to 	whether your representative has not failed to grasp the details of 	the apologia that has been issued from the Colonial Secretary’s 	Office. With your permission, I will, on behalf of my Association, 	proceed to examine certain facts alleged therein.  	In the first place, it is stated that representations have been add- 	ressed to the Colonial Secretary on behalf of the Indian community 	with a view to obtaining certain modifications of the regulations. 	My Association denies the statement absolutely. The facts are these: 	On the 30th August, a petition was addressed by Messrs  Stegmann,  	Esselen & Roos, on behalf of “some leading Indian people  of  	Pretoria, Standerton, Pietersburg, and  Middelburg”,  to  the 	Honourable the Colonial Secretary to secure some modification of the 	regulations. The intention of Messrs Stegmann, Esselen & Roos, 	clients was to show that they spoke for quite a number  of 	representative Indians, and immediately these facts became known to 	my Association, my Association addressed a letter to the Pretoria    
 solicitors, repudiating the right of these people to speak on behalf of the Indian community and, therefore, of my Association. The wording of the letter which I have quoted above suffices to show that the representations made to the Government were made on behalf of certain individuals acting in their private capacity, and most of whom are now registered. In reply to these representations, the Honourable the Colonial Secretary informed his petitioners that he was unable to comply with their requests but made some trifling modifications of practically no value. The persons on whose behalf the Pretoria solicitors acted were so dissatisfied with this reply, that they returned, through Messrs Stegmann, Esselen & Roos, an answer to the effect that they desired to withdraw their request as set forth in their letter of the 30th August, leaving the Honourable the Colonial Secretary at liberty to withdraw such concessions as he might have been able to make. It will thus be seen that the Indian community made no representations to the Honourable the Colonial Secretary in the matter of the regulations, but that whatever representations were made came from certain individuals, who have since withdrawn their request, the letter of withdrawal being dated the 12th ultimo.
 May I be allowed to say here, on behalf of my Association, that it is utterly false to allege that it is only now that the British Indian community has taken up a position which it did not venture to take up during the earlier stages of the agitation? The Colonial Secretary’s Department must be singularly ill-informed, if it is unaware of the fact that passive resistance to the law has existed since September, 1906. The oath of passive resistance was taken at the Mass Meeting held in Johannesburg in that month, at which the Registrar of Asiatics himself was present. My Association has consistently declined to enter at all into the question of regulations framed under the Act. Having from the first declined to recognise the validity of the Act itself, it would have been undignified in the extreme had my Association entered into minor details. My Association, having ignored the existence of these regulations, cannot by any stretch of imagination be said to have repudiated the modifications alleged to have been made in favour of British Indians by the Honourable the Colonial Secretary  at  the alleged request of the community. It is a mistake  altogether  to suppose that the passive resistance movement entered into by my Association and by the Indian community commenced in July last when registration was announced. The total repeal of the Act has been demanded from the very commencement of the struggle last year.
 A side issue has been raised in connection with the petition recently forwarded by my Association to the Honourable the Colonial Secretary. This petition sets forth, amongst other things, that the
 signatories thereto dissociate themselves entirely from the letter addressed to the Honourable the Colonial Secretary by Messrs Stegmann, Esselen & Roos on behalf of their clients; and the signatories respectfully submitted that nothing short of a total repeal of the Act could meet the difficult situation that had been created. There was nothing new in this. The official informant of your correspondent would make it appear that, consequent upon  the Honourable the Colonial Secretary’s slight modifications of the regulations which were contained in a letter forwarded about the end of September last, the Indian community took advantage of an alleged act of leniency to circulate the petition in order to take further advantage of what will doubtless have been considered to be an act of grace. In point of fact, immediately that it was known to my Association that Messrs Stegmann, Esselen & Roos’ letter of the 30th August had been dispatched to the Colonial Secretary, my Association issued forms of the petition in five different languages and circulated these all over the Colony. This was at the beginning of September. By the end of September, when the Honourable the Colonial Secretary’s reply was received by the Pretoria solicitors, practically all these forms had been returned to my Association duly completed. As, however, Johannesburg was to be the last place where registrations were to be effected and October was to be [the] last month for effecting them, my Association decided to hold over the petition until the end of last month, in order to demonstrate to the Government the solidity of the British Indian community in its opposition to the Asiatic Law Amend- ment Act, and this notwithstanding the withdrawal of their letter of Messrs Stegmann, Esselen & Roos’ clients on the 12th ultimo.
 I will now pass briefly to the question of the extension of the period of registration to the end of November. My Association asserts emphatically that this decision has taken place at the last moment, and the statements made by no less than three Cabinet Ministers support my Association’s contention. If any further confirmation be needed, it will be found in a circular issued to Resident Magistrates throughout the Colony from the Colonial Secretary’s Office on the 16th ultimo and signed by the Registrar of Asiatics, stating that Resident Magistrates should inform Asiatics that “it has been decided that the period for applications for registration, which expires on the 31st instant, cannot be extended”, and that all Asiatics resident in the different districts should be instructed to apply for registration on or before that day at the Old Dutch Church, Von Brandis Square, Johannesburg. There is no questioning the definiteness of these instructions, and it is quite obvious that the Hon. the  Colonial  Secretary, finding that the number of applications made at
 
 Johannesburg from the whole [of the] Transvaal did not exceed 25, decided, at the last moment, to extend the time for another month. It will thus be seen that Government Notice No. 1907 published in the Gazette of the 4th ultimo made no provision  whatever  for  an extension of time during which Asiatics who had not previously registered could make application under the new law.
 One last matter to which my Association desires to draw attention is that, so far from each town having the time marked out for Asiatic residents therein alone to make application, it was advertised that all Asiatics in towns previously visited by the Registration Officers could make application at the town newly advertised, if they had not previously done so, and, whilst Johannesburg was the last place advertised where Asiatics from all over the Transvaal should register and nowhere else, my Association charges the officials of the Registrar’s Office with receiving clandestine applications at Pretoria from a few cowards who furnished affidavits fraudulently and falsely representing that they had been prevented from making application before owing to intimidation on the part of certain unnamed persons. My Association desires to make it known once more that, in this struggle, British Indians are fighting with open hands. There is no need for them to resort to subterfuge or mendacity. It has been urged against British Indians that they, like all other Eastern peoples, suffer from a duplicity that has been termed “oriental”. It is difficult indeed to characterise the strange distortion of facts contained in your correspondent’s telegram.

         	Mr. Labistour’s sad disappearance from our midst leaves Natal the 	poorer on that account. The Natal Bar has lost in him a clever and 	genial member, the Government a faithful servant, and Indians a true 	friend. The tribute paid by the Bench was well deserved. The Indians 	cannot but recall with gratitude the brave stand Mr. Labistour took 	up regarding the Dealers’ Licenses Act, when he was a Town 	Councillor.libtech_376_footnote    
 And it may be added that, though the public are not aware of it, it was Mr. Labistour who, whilst he was firm in his policy as to regulation of Indian immigration, by his tactfulness saved many an Indian trader from ruin by declining to prosecute those Indians who, although they were old traders, were by reason of trade jealousy deprived of their licences.

241,,“ID” GREETINGS,"
    
 We offer Id greetings to our Muslim readers. Man hopes for many things, but he cannot get everything he wants. In like manner, though we wish a happy Id to all our Muslim brethren, so far as we know, it is the divine law that the Id will bring prosperity only to those who have observed the Ramzan month properly. We have gathered that merely keeping the fast cannot be considered sufficient for a proper observance of the Ramzan. The fast is a discipline of the mind as well as of the body. That means that, if not all through the year, at least during the Ramzan month, all the rules of morality should be fully obeyed, truth practised and every trace of anger suppressed. We assume that our greetings will bear fruit particularly in the case of those who have done all this.

 "
242,,HAPPY NEW YEAR,"
    
 Just as we wish a happy Id to out Muslim brethren, we also wish that the New Year may bring prosperity to our Hindu readers. This is our first issue after the New Year Day. We observe that in the Transvaal, in fact in the whole of South Africa, Indians suffer many hardships. As their spirit of patriotism has grown stronger in consequence of these hardships, they have come to pay more attention to their country, and to some extent their thoughts are also running in the direction of religion.
 The Hindu is seen to be more deeply absorbed in  Hindu religion, and likewise the Muslim in Islam, and other Indians in their own religions, which is the only right thing. It is our firm belief that, if India is to prosper, it can only be along this path. If the people of different religions grasp the real significance of their own religion, they will never hate the people of any religion other than their own. As Jalaluddin Rumi has said, or as Shri Krishna said to Arjun, there
 are many rivers, and they appear different from one another, but they all meet in the ocean. In the same manner, there may be many religions, but the true aim of all is the same, and that is to help one to see Khuda or Ishvar. Hence, if we look to the aim, there is no difference among religions. We said above that the New Year might bring prosperity to the Hindus. But just as it is obvious that the Id will bring prosperity only if a certain condition is fulfilled, so also can the New Year benefit a man only when a particular condition is satisfied. After saying all this, there is no need to point out what those conditions are.

243,,A WORD TO THE WISE,"
    
 There is a proverb among us that a word to the wise is enough. The signs that we see on every side indicate that, if we fight to the last, we shall win. Even today we have as good as won. But we  shall succeed in being able to live in the Transvaal with honour. We saw the comments  of  The  Friend.libtech_377_footnotelibtech_378_footnoteWe  know  that  the  time-limit  has   been extended to cover November. This shows the weakness of the Government. Those whites who rarely referred to the Indian question now talk only about that. A journal like The Leader warns the Government that it should exercise patience, bear in mind British principles, realize its responsibility and do justice to Indians.
 While, on the one hand, we see these encouraging signs, on the other, the time is approaching for a real test of Indians. It is said that we are only clever at talking. It is also charged against us that we show all our enthusiasm in the beginning. It now remains to be seen how we behave at the critical moment. If we do not exert ourselves to the utmost during the last stage, all that we have done so far will have been in vain. The struggle that has offered itself to the Indians, unasked, will not come again. If we fail to take advantage of such a rare opportunity,libtech_379_footnotelibtech_380_footnotewe shall never get it again in future. The struggle both does and does not involve a risk. Those who cling to money will

 naturally see a risk. But those who are servants of the country, who are true to their word, will not see the slightest risk. The law does not exist for such persons. They will not have been defeated just because the law is not repealed in spite of their fighting it. They will prove their worth a hundred per cent. They will enjoy the same esteem wherever they go. Unless we maintain such a spirit, there can be no success. They alone who go out to fight, determined to stake everything, return victorious. In this struggle, the real source of strength is Khuda— Ishvar. No one can make any conditions with Him. We cannot place trust [in Him] conditionally. We pray to God that the Indian com- munity may fully realize this and remain true to its word till the end.

 "
244,,EXTENSION OF TIME LIMIT,"
    
 Why has the Transvaal Government extended the time-limit for playing on the piano? The Government Gazette itself contains the answer to this question. It has been reported to the Government that Indians have not been able to apply for registration because of fear and for other reasons. That is why the time-limit has been extended. What can we say to an Indian making such a petition to the Government? Can he be called an Indian? Can he be called a man? Those who have made the application know that they have stated a big lie in it. No one uses threats. If threats were used in the past, have they stopped now? Pickets will continue to do their work. Those who have been pleading with the people will go on doing so. If anyone was deterred by fear in October, how will he be able to go [to the Permit Office] in November? If an extension of time-limit was desired, it could have been asked for in a straightforward manner. Even if the time-limit were not extended, those who wished to blacken their faces could have done so. However, it is useless to argue about this. One crime always leads to another. Once there is a breach in the embankment of a reservoir of water, it goes on increasing in size. Everyone who applies for registration knows that it is a crime to do so. Hence he is not ashamed or afraid of committing other crimes. Such is the degradation of those who submit to the obnoxious law.

 HAMIDIA ISLAMIC SOCIETY
 As usual, a meeting of the Hamidia Islamic Society took place on Sunday. Quite a large number of people were present. Mr. Emam Abdool Cadir was in the chair. Mr. Mahomed Khan read out the letter from Mr. Hajee Habib. It was on behalf of the Anjuman at Pretoria and offered congratulations to the Society on its work and to the pickets on their courage. Then Messrs Gandhi, Omarji Sale and M. S. Coovadia explained a few points. The meeting considered a suggestion that everyone should write to his friends all over the Colony that no one should go toPretoria during November and that, if at all it was necessary to visit it on business, none should go to the Permit Office in any case; the suggestion was accepted by all.
 MEETING OF CHINESE
 The Chinese hold their meeting every Sunday. This time the Chinese Consul was present. Mr. Gandhi was specially invited. He explained what had happened in November and the meeting decided to post Chinese pickets in Pretoria.
 “PLAGUE” IN NOVEMBER
 We saw in Indian Opinion of last week that the people’s fear that the “plague” in the form of the Permit Office might continue in November was justified. The Government has thus, by keeping the Office open, unmistakably admitted its weakness. If General Smuts had the strength to deport Indians, he would never have extended the time limit so as to allow applications for registration to be made in November. What has happened to the notice given in October that no one would be registered after the 31st of that month? What has happened to the intimation sent everywhere that October gave the last opportunity to apply? We are asked—persuaded—to believe that General Smuts never yields. But the editor [of Indian Opinion] has proved to us that General Smuts has yielded under pressure on three points. The extension of time-limit beyond October is the fourth point on which he has yielded. Someone may ask what there was for General Smuts to be afraid of on this occasion. The answer to this question is quite simple. The Imperial Government must have impressed upon him confidentially that he would not be able to touch any Indian. If this inference is not correct, General Smuts must have been afraid of loss of prestige. An elephant must think a hundred times before trampling upon an ant. General Smuts believes himself to be an elephant, and we are the ants. Hence he feels ashamed to
 trample upon ants.
 ANOTHER INSTANCE OF WEAKNESS
 I referred last week to a widespread rumour to the effect that Mr. Gandhi would be the first to be attacked, and that preparations were going on to deport everyone. I have now with me a letter bearing on this question.
 CACHALIA’S CONVERSATION WITH ROOS
Mr. Cachalia writes as under:
 I had a talk with Mr. Roos, in the course of which he informed me that the Natal Government had agreed that, when people were deported from the Transvaal, they would be put on steamers directly from the train at the Point, as arranged by the Transvaal Government. It was especially emphasized that the Government had already made the decision in any  case  to deport Mr. Gandhi.
 Who would be more fortunate than Mr. Gandhi if he should be the first to be deported? If that happens, the Indian community will only feel a fresh accession of courage rather than get demoralized. But so far the Transvaal has not acquired any such authority for deporting anyone, and it will be some time before it gets it. It is obvious that the words of Mr. Roos only reflect the Government’s desperation.
 WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRISONER AND PERSON ACCEPTING TITLE-DEED OF SLAVERY?
 It is reported that papers with eighteen finger-prints do not remain in the Registrar’s Office, but are handed over to the police. The book which maintains the record of criminals will also maintain the record of these “brave” Indians. Hence, those who submit to the law come to be treated as criminals in every way. The only difference is that, while the thief comes to be treated as a criminal for stealing something, the Indian who takes out the title-deed of slavery allows himself to be treated as a criminal just out of cowardice. Which of the two is worse off may be decided by the reader himself. As we think of the eighteen finger prints, we remember a poem that we learnt in our childhood. All the eighteen limbs of the camel are crooked and bent; how can they ever be kept hidden? The Indian who gives eighteen finger-prints appears to be reduced to a similar plight.
 WITHOUT ANY FUSS
In India, when the rains are heavy, the prices of vegetables go
 down. Similarly, the Registrar’s Office is having heavy rains, with the result that the Registrar’s price has fallen. It is said that the Registrar issues registers to children without asking any questions. I see nothing wrong in this. Nowhere else is it difficult to take out a title-deed of slavery. But we must note that all this is a net to catch the prey with, and we must keep away from it. There should be no need to make any such comment. But I sometimes hear it said: Mr. So-and-so has served himself well, having managed to get himself registered. Such a  thought will occur only to a person who does not understand the law and our struggle against it. If it is to our advantage to get ourselves registered under the law, then our struggle is unjustified, and it should be our duty to take out the registers. Getting oneself registered is harmful; it is sinful; it is to be shunned in obedience to our oath. That is why we do not get ourselves registered. How then can we say that one has served oneself well by gettingoneself registered? We are fighting to become men and to live as men. If someone should behave as a woman, why should we regard it as “serving himself well”? We should keep a firm hold of the idea that those who have not registered themselves are free and will remain free; they will continue in the Transvaal only if they can do so with honour. On the contrary, those who have got themselves registered have accepted permanent slavery.
 “THE TRANSVAAL LEADER” TO OUR AID
 There are indications that the newspapers in the Transvaal will come to our aid just as The Friend from Bloemfontein has done. There are many whites who even show their sympathy. Whether the newspapers come to our aid or not, the comments of the Leader in its issue of Monday should give us courage. I summarize them below:libtech_381_footnote
 HOW?
 The Government, in compliance with the requests of certain Asiatics, has extended the period of registration by a month. It is not known on what lines the Government intends to proceed at the end of that time. The decision to extend the period must have been taken at a late stage, since, only on the previous day, Mr. Solomon had scouted the notion of anything of the sort being done. Was nothing known of these requests for extension until the eleventh hour? Were the requests forwarded in a body on Friday? If the Government has received any acknowledgements of its action in extending the period from any of the leaders of the Asiatics, it will be wise to publish their names, so as to influence the others. As far as the public knows, there is no hint of such acknowledgement, and no modification of attitude on the part of
 
 the leading personalities. On the contrary, they assert that there is no power of deportation which can be applied against them,  and  in support of their view they quote the opinion of Mr. Leonard.
 Even an intelligent person like Sir Raymond West holds that the law is contrary to British principles. But there remain the powers conferred by the Immigration Act. Is it beyond doubt that action taken under that Act will be unchallenged by Indians before the Privy Council? If the Government possess the power of deportation and decide to exercise it, it must deport them to the country of  their origin. Will not the Government of India intervene in that case? Practically every public man with the exception of Mr. Hosken seems to be opposed to the Indians. But, looking at the question  more closely, we find that the public refrains from taking an obvious way of driving the Asiatics out, namely, by not supporting them; that there is no harassment of Asiaticservants by employers; and that there are no signs that the white population in general is opposed to the Indians. The onlooker is not immediately successful in reconciling all these facts and statements. The position bristles with difficulties, and if it be necessary to consider it afresh, it is hardly necessary to say that it is the duty of all leaders to deal with it from a non-party standpoint. General Smuts and Mr. Gandhi are called upon to deal with a very complex question. Facilities of travel and other features of what we regard as civilisation have profoundly changed the relationships of East and West. The Asiatic, who formerly never dreamed of going abroad, has started doing so. He is thrifty, courteous and economical to a point the European apparently cannot attain to. We go into his countries but in dozens for his thousands; and where he can, he stops the dozens. Indeed, it is admitted by the Asiatic himself that the Transvaal is not to be called upon to permit an unchecked irruption. It is the general profession of our European population that they wish to deal fairly by the Asiatics who are already here. All that is at issue is the method. The Asiatics protest that the method adopted by the Government is unfair and degrading. Has the Government considered every alternative method? Will not photographs, signatures, etc., prove effective? Has it taken counsel with those who know the Indian character? If it needs assistance at any point, we feel certain that quite a large number of men will render it. If any steps have to be retraced, it is to be hoped that no unworthy consideration will deter the Government from doing so. The Europeans of the Colony want to prevent further Asiatic inroads, but also wish to bear in mind our responsibilities as a State of the Empire and above all the traditions common to all our nationalities, which will make intensely repugnant to us, and in the end defeat, any policy lacking justice or even chivalry
 
 towards a weak and inoffensive people.
 This excellent account contains only one error, namely, that the writer has taken for granted that our fight is only with regard to fingerprints. That error does not matter much. That a journal like the Leader advises the Government to retrace its steps and do justice indicates that the ship is about to change the direction. The only question is whether the Indians will exert themselves now as much as they must.
 WARNING TO BARBERS
 The Johannesburg Municipality has decided  to  make regulations for barbers; since the regulations are likely to be passed, I summarize them below:
 l. The barber should keep his saloon perfectly clean and arrange for proper ventilation in it.
  The 	clippers, scissors, 	razors, combs, brushes, 	etc., should always 	be kept clean.  While 	shaving or giving 	a hair-cut, 	the barber 	should put on 	a robe reaching 	up to the 	neck. He 	should have 	his hands 	properly washed.  In 	case a 	barber or 	any of 	his assistants 	suffers from a 	skin disease 	or any 	other contagious 	disease, he should 	not shave 	anyone or 	give anyone a hair-cut.  After 	January 1, every 	barber’s saloon should be 	registered. It 	will be 	registered by 	the Council without any fee.  A 	sanitary inspector 	or physician 	is entitled 	to enter any 	saloon. 
 A copy of these regulations should be displayed in every saloon. The Council has made the following recommendations:
  Every 	shelf or table 	should be covered 	with glass, 	marble slab, 	slate or tin sheet.  A 	fresh towel should 	be used 	for every 	customer and 	the neck 	rest should be covered 	every time with a fresh 	napkin or piece 	of paper.  Two 	brushes should be 	kept for 	use in shaving 	each one 	being placed in 	a disinfectant 	solution and then 	taken out for use by 	turns. Soap 	water, soap powder or a 	soap stick should be used.  The 	razor should be 	wiped on 	clean paper. After use, 	the razor 	and other 	instruments should 	be kept 	in a 	disinfectant solution 	for four or five minutes. The disinfectant solution should be made by 
 mixing two teaspoonfuls of Celivelibtech_382_footnoteor Carollibtech_383_footnotein  a  quart  of  water  or three teaspoonfuls of Eusoll in an equal quantity of water.
  After 	shave, instead of an alum stick, a water spray should be used 	or clean 	cotton soaked in water.  A 	sponge should not 	be used 	at all. 	Cotton or 	some such 	thing should be 	used in 	its place. Cotton 	should be used 	instead of rags 	for powdering.  The 	hair-brush should 	be white, 	and it 	should be 	washed once every day 	with water, soap and 	soda bicarb.  When 	giving a 	close hair-cut, the 	hair dropping on 	the neck 	should not be 	blown off by 	the mouth, 	but an 	air-propeller should be 	used.  The 	bits of 	hair fallen 	on the 	ground should be 	collected into a 	covered utensil instead 	of being 	swept into a corner. 
 The regulations and suggestions given above should be noted by every barber. It is not merely that anyone ignoring the regulations will be fined; it should be admitted that it is the duty of the barber to observe such cleanliness. In India, owing to the carelessness of barbers or their lack of cleanliness, people get infected with eczema, scabies, etc. It will be of advantage to the barbers to observe the regulations givenabove they will then be regarded to have received an education that is real and useful. All this requires no expenditure, one has only to be keen on it.
 OFFICIAL EXPLANATION
 The Government has given an explanation why the time-limit was extended to November. The explanation itself proves the Government’s guilt. If it had not felt concerned, where was the need to extend the time-limit to November? The Government has given the reason that, since there was no other work in November, a favour was done to the Asiatics [by extending the time-limit]. This is pointless. For, the Government knew that there were to be no arrests in November. Moreover, if what the Government says is true, why were police constables sent to every house? It is also to be noticed that the Government has now stopped talking about the  application  by Indians. This absurd explanation is intended to answer the criticism in the Leader. The Leader had asked for the names of the leading men who had made the application. But there are no such names. How, then, can they be supplied by the Government? The Government concludes the explanation by saying that the Act will definitely be
 
 
 enforced from December onwards. How often will it give  this warning? Like the shepherds [in the fable], the Indian community has stopped being afraid of the all-too-frequent cry of “tiger”. It is true that, when the real tiger came, no one believed it. But there will be no need to be afraid even when the Government-tiger does in fact come. For, the Indian community has torn to pieces and devoured the tiger in the form of imprisonment or deportation. Let the Government-tiger come as often as it wants.
 WHITES ARE YIELDING
 The Rand Daily Mail reports that it was made emphatically clear by Mr. Gandhi and other Indians at the time of the mass meeting in Pretoria that the Indian community would never agree to give finger-prints. This fact should add to the courage of Indians; for, both the Government and the whites are now seriously considering how this knotty question can be resolved, and hence they are trying to understand what we want. Though  we have expressed strong resentment at having to give finger-prints, and the compulsion to give finger-prints has given an impetus to our struggle, we must all emphasize, while talking to everyone, that this struggle is not about giving or not giving finger-prints but that it is a struggle for the honour and dignity of the Indian community. The Government wants to knock us down, and we do not want to be knocked down. It has passed a law to enslave us, and we shall not submit. to it so long as we are alive; such is the meaning of this struggle.
 REGRET AT PIETERSBURG
 
 Mr. Gani Ismail and Mr. Hasan Mahomed Kala write from Pietersburg that both of them feel extremely sorry for having made the application for new registers in Johannesburg, that their remorse knows no bounds, and that the thought of their plight when the law comes into force gives them a stab in the heart. These are the words that both these Indians have used. Besides, they say that they have got only the receipt, but not the title-deed of slavery. They want to know if there is any way of withdrawing the application. If they really wish to do so, I can tell both the gentlemen that it is a very simple matter. Just as Mr. Chang Tong (a registered Chinese) had flung back the register issued to him, so also should the application that has been made be withdrawn. If one does not wish to accept the deadly register, there is a very simple way [of rejecting it]. To get the register, they will have to travel again to Pretoria, and give a thumb-impression on the register. The two gentlemen can refuse to do either of these things. They will then remain free. They are not bound to go to receive the
 register. If they do not go, they will as a matter of course remain without the title-deed of slavery. I very much hope that their remorse is real, and not merely a superficial boiling-over. If it is in fact real, other Indians, too, will take courage from it. I advise both of them to remember the example of Mr. Sheikh Mahomed Essak.libtech_384_footnote
 COWRARD’S FRIEND SHIP IS HARMFUL
 I hear that, in July, Mr. Ismail Hajee Amad Kodtha had sent telegrams to the Memons from Mafeking to remain firm and not to submit to disgrace, and encouraged them to be bold. The same gentleman went to Pretoria and, having taken out the title-deed of slavery, attained immortality in this paper. If such a braggart goes on sending brave telegrams, who will be inspired by such telegrams, and how? This instance deserves to be noted by every Indian in  the mofussil areas. One must always keep in mind what Mr. Ali Khamisa used to say before he became a slave. Whenever anyone from outside Pretoria advised us to have courage, Mr. Khamisa would quote the sentence: “Those who are not involved in the struggle, pose to be brave people.” Persons sending telegrams from Durban should learn this proverb by heart: let them take care that  claylibtech_385_footnotelibtech_386_footnotedoes not turn into dust.
 STRONG REPLY BY ESSOP MIA
 Mr. Essop Mia has written a strong letter to the Leader and The Star in connection with General Smuts’ explanation. I shall give a translation of it next week. He has proved in it that the lies of the Government have exceeded all limits.
 SERVED RIGHT!
 From among those who had applied for the title-deed of slavery in Johannesburg, one Konkani and one Madrasi have already received notices to leave the country.
 SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT ON DAYALJI AND APPEAL AGAINST IT
 There was a case against Dayalji Pragji Desai for assaulting Govind in which judgment has now been given by the magistrate of the court at Pretoria. Mr. Desai has been sentenced to four months’ imprisonment with hard labour. He has filed an appeal against it.
 
 BLACKLEGS
 Names of persons registered up to Saturday last: [30] from Pretoria, [16] from Pietersburg, [3] from Louis Trichardt, [3] from Middelburg, [4] from Potchefstroom, [5] from Standerton, and [l] from Johannesburg.
 PITIABLE CASE
 A Portuguese Indian, named Miranda, was found to have been without a permit and ordered to leave the Transvaal before October
  The 	period of 	notice having expired, 	he was 	again produced in 	court last 	Saturday. The 	accused stated that 	he had 	no money 	for leaving the 	Transvaal and 	so he could 	not go 	away. The 	magistrate held 	him guilty and sentenced 	him to 	one month’s rigorous imprisonment, 	and told him to 	leave the Transvaal 	within seven days 	of his 	coming out 	of gaol, 	failing which, he was 	threatened with 	a further 	sentence of six 	months’ rigorous 	imprisonment. This is 	indeed a 	pitiable case. 	Now, he should 	defy the Government 	and go 	to gaol again 	and again. Then 	alone will the Government 	come to 	its senses. 	Needless to 	say that, if 	we do not defeat the 	Government by 	remaining firm 	in this 	struggle till 	the end, 	the Indians 	in the 	Transvaal will 	be doomed 	for ever 	to such hardships.

LETTER TO “THE TRANSVAAL LEADER”","
 The Leader of Johannesburg has published the following letter from Mr. Gandhi:libtech_387_footnote
Sir,
 In your leading article, in today’s issue, on the Asiatic Registration Act, you have imputed to the British Indian Association a statement to the effect that nearly the whole of the four hundred men said to have been registered had no right to be in the Transvaal. I am not aware of any such statement having been made by any official of the Association. I know that some of our pickets did make some such statement, but that was mere bravado. The chief picket, Mr. Naidoo, immediately corrected it, but the correction did not appear in your report. The official statement made by the Association is that four men at least who, according to the interpretation of the law put upon it
 
 by the Government, have no right to be in the country have applied for and probably received registration certificates. The Association does not even consider these men to be not entitled to their certificates.
 If the Government keep the Office open for receiving applications, I must respectfully decline to consider it as a graceful concession, as it would be, in the opinion of the majority of Indians, a confession of weakness on the part of the Government. The British Indian Association, in all humility and in obedience to a higher call, has challenged the Government to do its worst. We do not require the registration pin-pricks. It has been stated that the pickets kept Indians away from the plague-spot; (and that was the reason  why  the time-limit was extended) the pickets, however, will continue to exercise the same vigilance in Pretoria also.
 You ask what can be gained by the Indian opposition in the teeth of General Smuts’ threat and the refusal of intervention by the Imperial Government. So far as I am aware, in the last resort, Indians have not pinned their faith either to intervention from the Imperial Government or to recognition of the principles of humanity by General Smuts. Though the effort now being made by the Indian community is undoubtedly calculated, if successful, to give them a status in the Colony, they are fully aware that they may lose their all in the struggle. But, if that happens, which I do not believe, Indians will shine with a new light, like gold tested in fire, which will be a gain in itself. As between that gain and allthat General Smuts and his Act can give to the Indian community, I have no hesitation in asking my countrymen to prefer the former at all costs. You will then see that the sanctioning of the Immigration Restriction Bill or any other harsher measure will not turn the community from the straight and narrow path. If it does, and I do not say that it will not, then every Indian knows that there is a precipice on either side.
 The following is the substance of the article in the Leader of November 1:
 Though October is over, only about 400 persons out of a total of 8,000 have registered. According to the British Indian Association, nearly the whole of this 400 are men who have no right to be in the Transvaal. There are 1,100 Chinese in the Transvaal, out of whom only two have registered, and these two are also half-caste. The Government is quite firm in spite of such a large number of persons having refused to register. In view of the difficulties in the way of registration, such as intimidation by pickets, it was both wise and kind to have
 extended the time-limit. Since, rightly or wrongly, the Act is on the Statute-book, we think it will be better if the Indians submit to it. In view of the Prime Minister’s reply in Parliament refusing to intervene, and the known attitude of General Smuts on the question, what does the Indian community expect to gain by continuing its resistance?

LETTER TO GENERAL SMUTS","
 The monster petition, along with the forms containing the signatures, has been dispatched to the Colonial Secretary, with a forwarding letter by the Chairman of the British Indian Association, Mr. Essop Mia, a summary of which was reproduced under “Late News” in the last issue. We now give the letter in full:libtech_388_footnote
Sir,
 I have the honour to forward, by parcel post, the petition of the British Indians throughout the Transvaal, in connection with the  Asiatic Registration Act, and herewith a copy of the instructions issued to the canvassers.
 When the forms were distributed through the Colony, the letter addressed to the Government on behalf of certain Indians, asking for a modification of the regulations framed under the Act, was still unanswered and the letter not withdrawn. But though since  then  Messrs Stegmann, Esselen and Roos’ clients have not received a reply to their satisfaction, and although they have therefore withdrawn the letter, the committee of my Association desires me to forward the petition, as it embodies the sentiments of those who have signed it. In the humble opinion of my Association, the petition forms a complete vindication of the attitude adopted by it, and shows that it is representative of the vast majority of Indians in the Colony. The petition has been ready for some time, but my Association delayed its presentation, in order to test the action of the community during the period that the Registration Office remained open in Johannesburg.
 There are 4,522 signatories to the petition, and they are drawn from 29 towns, villages and districts in the Transvaal. The following is the analysis according to the centres: Johannesburg, 2,085; Newclare,
 
 108; Roodepoort, 136; Krugersdorp, 179; Germiston, 300; Boksburg,
129; Benoni, 91; Modderfontein, 51; Pretoria, 577; Pietersburg and
Spelonken,   90;    Vereeniging,   73;    Heidelberg,    66;    Balfour, 14;
Standerton  123;  Volksrust,  36;   Wakkerstroom,   12;   Piet   Retief, 3;
Bethal, 18; Middelburg, 29; Belfast, Machadodorp, and Waterval,  21;
Barberton, 68; Potchefstroom, 114; Ventersdorp, 12; Klerksdorp, 4l;
 Christiana, 24; Lichtenburg, 7; Zeerust, 59; Rustenburg, 54; Ermilo, 2. The following, then, is the religious and provincial classification: Surtis, l,474; Konkanis, 141; Memons, 140; Gujarati Hindus, 1,600;
 Madrassis, 991; Northerners, 157; Parsees, 17. In order to avoid a separate classification for the Sikhs and the Pathans, they have been included among the Gujaratis, if Hindus, and among the Surtis, if Mahomedans. The Christians have not been separately classified as they are nearly all Madrassis, and are not more than 200 in all.
 With the exception of the Memons, there are hardly any abstentions, but the task of reaching every Indian in the isolated parts of the Transvaal—as, for instance, farms, etc.—has been beyond my Association during the time that was allotted for the canvassing of signatures. Canvassers, who were in all cases responsible and representative men, have reported that a large number of Indians have already left the Transvaal. It is common knowledge that nearly 13,000 permits had been issued to British Indians before the struggle commenced in September, 1906. Today the British Indian population of the Transvaal, according to the information at the disposal of my Association, does not at the outside exceed 8,000, but it is probably nearer 7,000 than 8,000, the rest having preferred to leave the country rather than be reduced to slavery. My Association is aware thatpressure was brought to bear by white employers on most of those who have registered, excepting a few Memons. Moreover, according to the information received by my Association, no more than 350 Indians have applied for registration throughout the Transvaal during the period from July l to October 3l, and that 95 per cent of these applicants are drawn from the Memon section.
 In conclusion, my Association begs to draw the attention of the Government to the intensity of the feeling of the community represented by my Association against the Asiatic Law Amendment Act. In taking up the attitude the community has felt called upon to adopt, there has been no intention of defying the Government; rather, it is a proof of the community’s intense sense of the wrong done to it. This sense of injury is so deep that the community has felt compelled to prepare for undergoing a course of suffering which passive resistance, as understood by British Indians, involves.

[GERMISTON,
 November 11, 1907]
 
 Mr. Gandhi said that, whilst he did not wish to oppose the application for a remand, he informed the Court that, so far as Mr. Pundit was concerned, there was no defence to be offered, but that facts in justification only were to be brought to the notice of the Court. The Pundit would admit that he was in the Colony without a permit. His client was most anxious that the case should be finished without delay. In any case, he had already been in custody for four days and, although scores of Indians had offered to bail him out, the Pundit refused to be bailed out. If, therefore, the case was remanded, Mr. Gandhi suggested that the Pundit should be released on his own recognisance. To this the Court agreed.

 November 11, 1907]
 Mr. Gandhi informed me that it libtech_391_footnotewas against the religion of Indians— Mohamedans especially—because it took away the personal liberty of every Asiatic coming within the meaning of the Act, the result being that, instead of his being the creature of God only, he became the creature of any official appointed under the Act, and a man believing in God would never even dream of submitting to an Act which really enslaved him.
 Now, religion comes more into play because all Indians are bound by a solemn oath not to accept the Registration Act, as it is opposed to their religion, and every Indian, therefore, would be doing violence to his conscience if he now, for any material advantage he might gain, were to accept the Act. Consequently, the priest  has actively interested himself in seeing that the people do not register, and that rather than look to the things on earth, they look to those from above. This accounts for his (Ram Sundar Pundit) having acted as chief picket when the Asiatic Registration Office was [kept] open in Germiston, picketing having been a purely persuasive act.

 a Christian, Mahomedan, Hindu or belongs to any other persuasion, I consider he is a desirable, so long as he continues to preach his doctrine; but when he preachesother doctrines—I will not say sedition—and resorts to methods for inciting his people to violence, he becomes a person other than the one I understood I was allowing to enter this Colony.
 WHAT HE PREACHED
 Have you any proof that he has preached anything but his religious doctrine?
 I believe he has, and it is because of that belief that I refused to renew the permit.
You say you believe he has acted other[wise] than as a priest?
 I did not say that.
 You have just said that you had grounds for believing that he was preaching other than religious doctrines. Have you sufficient grounds for that belief?
 I have had complaints both from white and coloured people.
Have you ever warned him with reference to these complaints?
 Certainly not
When did you receive the complaints?
 I cannot remember the exact dates, but it was in respect of the registration of Asiatics.
Can you produce the complaints?
 I certainly will not.
 Then, Mr. Chamney, you positively decline to produce the complaints?
 I positively decline to disclose to you the names of the persons who have complained.
 In response to the request made by Mr. Gandhi, witness produced a petition, dated the 28th September last, which he had received from the Indians of Germiston, asking him to extend the accuser’s permit, which was about to expire, and stating that the accused devoted himself solely to the work of the temple and his religious duties.
 You did not consider that petition to be sufficient inducement to extend the permit?
 No, I did not, in view of the reports I had in my possession.
You admit the accused bought the Hindu Temple at Germiston?
 I don’t know anything about it. He came on a few weeks’ permit, and we extended that permit for over a year, and I don’t know what he did.
 And you would probably have extended to the end of all time but for this new Act?
 Very probably.
When you talk of “sedition”, what do you mean?
 I specially said that I did not refer to sedition.
 Then, what did you mean by your reference to his departure from his religious duties? Did you mean his preaching to the people not to submit to the Registration Act?
 I cannot answer hypothetical questions.
 You know he has preached against submission to the Asiatic Act. Has that been an ingredient?
 The answer is “Yes”, but I qualify it.
Have Mahomedan priests received extensions of their permit?
 Yes, and Christians and others, too.
You mean Asiatics?
 When I speak of Christians, you must understand, Mr. Gandhi, that I mean Assyrians.
 The Magistrate remarked that it was not so much a question of what Mr.
Gandhi understood, but of what the Court understood.
 MR. CHAMNEY’S METHODS
 
 Witness explained that, when a priest applied for a permit to enter the Transvaal to preach the Gospel, he (witness) never put any difficulties in his way; but Assyrians and Mahomedans came in such numbers that he had been requested to restrict the granting of permits. The Government had no objection to grant temporary permits to such priests, provided they carried out the conditions under which they were granted.
 Have   you   received    any   complaint   about   him	from	the Germiston Indians?
 I understand by “Germiston Indians” you mean the Indians of Germiston?
Yes.
 Then I have.
Have you investigated the complaints?
 Certainly.
Have you ever heard the accused in answer to these complaints?
 No, certainly not.
So that you have condemned him unheard?
 I have got his letter. Do not forget that!
Then produce it.
 I have already done so.
 
 But that letter is not in answer to any complaints?
 I did not say it was.
Then it is as I say, you have condemned him unheard?
 I allowed him to enter the Transvaal under certain conditions, which he has failed to carry out.
Have you ever informed him of that?
 I tell him now.
After he is hanged?
 No, not after he is hanged. I do not like that remark.
 The witness then read a letter, dated the 9th October last, which he had written to the accused, notifying to him that he must leave the Colony immediately.
 Mr. Gandhi: That does not answer my question at all. It is my answer.
 This closed the case for the prosecution . . .
 THE DEFENCE
 . . .PUBLIC PROSECUTOR: The accused had not had anything to do with the pickets?
 MR. GANDHI: I admit he was the chief picket....
 . . . Mr. Gandhi then addressed the Court. He admitted that a conviction, as the law stood, was bound to follow, but he urged that this was one of the cases in which an expression from the Bench was necessary. He cited the case of Rex vs. Bhabha, in which the Supreme Court had expressed strong opinion against the manner of administering the Peace Preservation Ordinance. His client was not  prosecuted  because he did not hold a permit, but, as was quite evident, because he had dared to hold strong views about the Asiatic Act and had not hesitated to place them before his countrymen. If that was a crime, then the majority of Indians were guilty equally with the accused. Ram Sunder Pundit, rightly or wrongly, believed that it was a part of his duty as a preacher to place the real facts about the Act before his countrymen. The religious objection went far beyond finger-prints and giving the wife’s name. The Pundit had preached, because, in his opinion, as in the opinion of  every  self-respecting Indian, the Act took away all manliness from Indians if  they  submitted to it. He considered that, in view of what the priest had done, instead of deserving censure, he was entitled to praise. He asked the Court to believe the accused when he said that there was no truth in the complaints which had never seen the light of day, and of the nature of which, even to the day of trial, the accused knew nothing. The accused knew the consequences of disobedience to the Registrar’s order, but, in his own words, he had a call of higher duty in obedience to which he was before the Court to suffer imprisonment or worse.libtech_394_footnote

253,"November 15, 1907",TRIAL OF PICKETS,"
    
 [PRETORIA,
 November 15, 1907]
 Gavarishanker Vyas, Sharfoodeen, Govind Prag and Frank Lutchman were charged on the 15th instant with the crime of assault, or inciting to the commission of an offence in that upon (or about) the 13th day of November 1907, and at (or near) Pretoria in the said District, the accused did each and all or one or other of them wrongfully and unlawfully assault one Lutchman, an Indian there residing and did then and there gather round him and arrest his progress, thereby preventing him from proceeding to the Indian Registration Office as desired by him (or alternately). At the same time and place, the said accused did each and all or one or other of them wrongfully and unlawfully incite the said Lutchman to refrain from applying for registration as required by Sections 1, 2 and 8 of Act 2/1907libtech_397_footnote, by threatening the said Lutchman that if he did register, he would be assaulted and have his face blackened. The accused pleaded not guilty, and were defended by Mr. Gandhi. Mr. Graham conducted the prosecution. The Court was crowded with Indians and many could not gain admission.
 The complainant said that the accused spoke to him outside the Registration Office, and said that their people were not taking out permits and advising him to consult those who were wiser than himself. The accused had never assaulted him.
 Mr. Graham asked that the witness I [Lutchman] be treated as a hostile witness, but Mr. Gandhi objected. The objection was noted, and the witness said that he was taken to the Charge Office and there he was asked by Mr. Cody if the accused had assaulted him, and he said, “No”. Mr. Cody said that he had arrested the accused, and when the witness asked, “Why?” he was told that it had been his (witness’) wish. Witness said that was not so. He said “They are of my nationality and ought not to be arrested. I came for a pass, and when I get it I shall go. They did not assault me.”
 BY MR. GANDHI: He came to Pretoria to get a pass because he had been told by a white man that he would be sent away if he did not. The white man had taken his documents and sent them to Mr. Cody. He was a washerman at Witbank. He was afraid of the Government in his heart, and that was why he came here. He was taken to the Registration Office by two white men who met him at the station...
 Cross-examined by Mr. Gandhi, witnesslibtech_398_footnotesaid he was instructed by
 
 Superintendent Betts to meet Lutchman at the station and escort him to the Registry Office, and if he (Lutchman) was molested to report the matter. Witness knew Hindustani well. He saw no assault take place.
 Mr. Graham closed his case, and Mr. Gandhi at once asked for the discharge of the accused. Mr. Graham had said that he could not support the assault charge and must rely on the incitement charge. Mr. Gandhi said he had no case to meet.
 MR. MELLORlibtech_399_footnote (smiling): Do you support this charge, Mr. Graham?
 MR. GRAHAM : As a matter of fact I don’t press the charge. I don’t think the case is strong enough.

254,"November 	15, 1907",LETTER TO “INDIAN OPINION”libtech_401_footnote,"
           TO THE 	EDITOR       JOHENNESBURG,  November 	15, 1907 
 INDIAN 	OPINION SIR,  	May I be allowed to bring to the notice of the public some very 	painful facts which came to light during the course of Ram Sundar 	Pundit’s triallibtech_402_footnoteon 	Thursday?  	The Registrar of Asiatics admitted that it was a rule of his Office 	to issue temporary permits to priests, the tacit understanding being 	that, so long as they only restricted themselves to the priestly 	vocation, the permits should be extended, in the Registrar’s 	words, “to the end of time”. He then stated that the Hindu 	priest had added something to the priestly vocation, which in the 	Registrar’s estimation, disqualified him for the right to 	extension. It was with difficulty that I was able to ascertain that 	that “some thing” included the priest’s  preaching against the 	Asiatic Act. His other misdemeanour was darkly hinted at, but the 	Registrar point-blank refused to disclose the nature of the 	complaints or the names of the complainants. He admitted that the       
 priest was never given the opportunity of facing his  unknown  traducers or answering the complaints; in other words, he was condemned unheard. I am not aware of any precedent, except during war-time, of any such high-handed, unjust and tyrannical action. One man, who, as he admitted in the witness-box, has not the slightest knowledge of law, is utterly incapable of weighing evidence, and who can scarcely distinguish between sedition and respectful and manly opposition to a particular law touching personal liberty, possesses under the Act extreme powers over the persons of free and inoffensive British subjects. He can dictate terms on which he would  allow  religious preachers to remain in the country, and, if he is displeased with them, he has the power almost summarily to close temples and deprive communities of religious consolation.
 And yet, Asiatics are often asked why they should object to a very simple law, whose only purpose is to identify those that are in the Colony !
 Mr. Leung Quinn has brought to the public  notice  one tragedy. The other that was enacted at Germiston on Thursday was great enoughfor the Magistrate to remark that he could not withhold sympathy from the accused, but the court was helpless, and  an innocent man had to be sacrificed on the altar of prejudice, ignorance, incompetence; and insolence of office—attributes un-British enough, surely!

255,,THE CAXT0N HALL MEETING,"
    
 Mr. Ameer Ali and the Moslem residents of  the  United Kingdom deserve the gratitude of the Indian community in the Transvaal for their having championed their cause. It was a happy thought on the part of the Hamidia Islamic Society to send out a general letterlibtech_403_footnotelibtech_404_footnoteto the Indian Mussulmans. The cablegrams show that the proceedings were enthusiastic, and that the meeting was attended by many prominent Europeans. It is a curious coincidence that the meeting should have taken place on the 9th of  November,  the  birthday of the King-Emperor. What would have been the feeling of Mr. Ameer Ali and his audience, had they known that, whilst they were pleading for justice and humanity on behalf of the
 
 down-trodden Indians in the Transvaal, that Government had already laid violent hands on an Indian priest? We are informed by Reuter that the speeches in denunciation of the Asiatic Act were punctuated by cries of “shame” and “disgraceful”. One way of dismissing this important meeting from consideration is to vote it down  as  the opinion of ignorant people knowing nothing of the local situation. Another way is to accept this opinion as being typical of the great dissatisfaction that permeates thousands upon thousands of Indians. Interpreted in the latter sense, the resolution passed by the meeting should command  the earnest and sympathetic attention of the Transvaal Government. And, yet, we feel that, unless the Imperial Government makes effective representations, the authorities in the Transvaal will turn a deaf ear to anything that may be said by Indians, no matter how influential and well-informed they may be. Be that, however, as it may, one thing the meeting has undoubtedly done, namely, that the Mussulmans from all parts of the world feel that they should not sympathise and work only for their co-religionists, but that they should also extend the scope of their activity to the Hindus. This is a good sign and it shows that we are fast approaching a time when men will work for men, irrespective of nationality or religion.

256,,LAJPAT RAI’S RELEASE,"
    
 LESSON FOR TRANSVAAL INDIANS
 Lala Lajpat Rai and his lieutenant Ajit Singh have been released. It is true that they had to suffer banishment, but they also succeeded in getting the [Punjab Lands] Act repealed. This success is a strong proof of the effectiveness of passive resistance. Does any Indian in the Transvaal have now reason for hesitation in the face of this recent example? We hope not. On the contrary, even those who have applied, if they can grasp the significance of Lajpat Rai’s success, will take the step, in case they have still the opportunity, of withdrawing their applications, i.e., of not going to receive the register. For, everyone admits that the Asiatic Act is bad. Those who have registered themselves have been trapped into slavery merely out of blind self-interest and fear of imprisonment. Lajpat’s success proves that those who entertain any fears are cowardly and as good as defeated; and that those who fight are heroes and as good as victorious. The signs that we see these days also point to the same conclusion, namely, that those who are fighting have as good as won. There is only one condition, that the fight should be continued to the last, even at the
 cost of imprisonment or deportation, which is also what Lajpat’s example points to. Therefore, we have not the slightest hesitation in saying that, if the Transvaal Indians draw the lesson which ought to be drawn from the banishment of India’s Lala and prepare themselves boldly to act accordingly, they are bound to win.

257,,KING-EMPEROR’S BIRTHDAY,"
    
 We think it was proper that telegrams of birthday greetings were sent to His Majesty King Edward. We are an ancient people. Courtesy runs in our blood. If the telegrams had not been sent, we would have been found wanting in courtesy. We have not sent the greetings specially by way of flattery, or in the hope of gaining anything in connection with the question of the [new] law. We sent the greetings because we thought that it was our duty to do so.
 Even so, why should such a telegram be sent? We received three gifts on the birthday. Ram Sundar Pundit was arrested without any reason. This was an attack on religion. Though he is a Hindu, the whole community has felt shocked. Passports have been refused for pilgrimage to Mecca. Licences were refused in Johannesburg  and other places. It is as if, while others are enjoying themselves,  the Indian community is to be in mourning. Should we, even then, send the telegrams of greetings?
 This question occurred to three former Presidents of the Natal Indian Congress, and quite justifiably. They felt that if we did want to send a telegram, we should also mention  our  grievances.  The objection that they raised is not to be set aside lightly. It indicates how much our feelings have been hurt. Even then, it is a sign of anger. It is not the fault of the Emperor that we suffer. The remedy lies in our hands. Since we feel the pinch, a remedy will be found. That remedy is in the hands of the Transvaal Indians.

258,,MEETING OF LONDON MUSLIMS,"
    
 This meeting, which the newspapers report as having taken place on November 9 in London, was no ordinary event. Justice Ameer Ali was in the chair. Many whites were present. Even if the new law does
 not confer any other benefit, there are at least signs that Hindus and Muslims will definitely come closer to one another. It  was  categorically stated at the meeting that the Muslims would insist on the rights of the Hindus too. The Muslims who attended the meeting were not all of them Indians. If the Muslims of India ask the right of the Hindus to be granted, it is after all their duty to do so. For, they are both children of India. But it is a matter for rejoicing that Muslims of other lands present in Britain should join in asking for these rights.

 All Indians must be eager to learn the history of the Indian who has raised such a storm. We publish his photograph in this issue. Ram Sundar Pundit is 30 years of age. His father’s name is Kalka Prasad. He was a priest by profession. Punditji was born in Banaras. He  studied Hindi and Sanskrit in the Banaras Sanskrit Pathshala. For the last nine years he has been working as a priest in South Africa. He has
 
 married in Natal. He has two children, a son, two-and-a-half years old, and a daughter, one year old. His family lives in Grey Town. Punditji came to the Transvaal in the year 1905. A temple was built in Germiston as a result of his efforts and the Sanatan Dharma Sabha was established. Everyone knows about his work relating to the Asiatic Law. Finally, we only wish that Punditji may live for many years and continue to render uninterrupted service to the community. [From Gujarati]

262,,WHAT DID INDIA’S LALA DO?,"
    
 We believe that Lala Lajpat Rai, in exile, is on a picnic. For, his object has been achieved. It was against the Punjab Lands Act that he gave a battle, and not merely for his own pleasure. That law  is wrecked; then, what does it matter to Lalaji whether he lives in Mandalay or in Lahore? Many know how to be wise and discreet in speech, but people do not pay attention to all that they say. But the man who follows up his words with deeds, who abides by his promise, will be listened to by everyone, though his words may be like the words of a mad man. For this reason, we give below the substance of a speech by Lala Lajpat Rai. There are noparticularly new thoughts in it, yet they are the thoughts of a patriot suffering exile. Therefore, they are worth our attention:
 Brothers, the Government says that this land (in the Punjab) is given by it; therefore, we must acknowledge its rights. The question is: whence did the Government obtain this land? This land and the sky above have been there since the beginning [of time]. Its first occupants were the Hindus; then the Muslims came and settled there. We Hindus and Muslims are the heirs of both these. That being so, let the Government show how it can appropriate that land. It belongs to God. He has given it to us. There may be an emperor (ruling) over it; but it certainly does not belong to the emperor’s servant. High-salaried officers are not our kings, but our servants. They are paid by us.
 We are like a sleeping lion. Finding us slumbering, some may pull our tail; some may spit upon us; but if we are  conscious of our worth, then there is none who can harass us. Our enemies wish to create animosity between Hindus and Muslims; they wish to divide the Sikhs and the Hindus. Their greatest weapon is to keep us divided against one another. Everything has its own characteristic property. Water cools; fire
 burns; so the property of foreign rulers is, by keeping us  divided, to perpetuate their power over us. Our property must be to counteract this aim of theirs. Our first duty is that, if there is among us an Indian who is a traitor, then he should be excommunicated. We should go to the Viceroy. It is also desirable to go to England. And if we sincerely believe that, when fighting for our rights, dying and living are the same to us, then the officers will immediately say: “Yes, that land is  certainly yours.”
 There is no other remedy for this disease. We must unite and live together; that is all. If the Government seizes anyone’s land, and wishes to give it to another who is prepared to submit to the new Lands Act and if anyone from among us comes forward to buy the land by submitting to the law, then we must treat him as an enemy of the country and a traitor. If the Government seizes anyone’s land, then we should take an oath not to buy that land. Let us be men; let us not become women. If you remain firm in your oaths, you will not have to make petitions. When you swear by your scriptures or the Koran, and remain loyal to one another, there will be none in this world who will dare insult you.
 The land of India is to the Hindu a heaven; to the Muslim it is a paradise. We raise millions of tons of foodgrains; yet every day seven crores of the sons and daughters of India go hungry.
 The best remedy for this disease is that we should defend our self respect and dignity. Every day thousands of people die of the plague; but he dies a true death who lays down his life for another, whether it be in gaol or outside.
 We shall publish next week a letter written by Lalaji from Mandalay which is worth reading. We request our readers to  go through the article given above repeatedly and apply it to the situation in South Africa.

263,,RAM SUNDAR PUNDIT’S TRIAL IN COURT,"
    
 HUGE MEETING IN GERMISTON
 We have already reported in “Late News” last week that Ram Sundar Pundit was arrested on Friday, the 8th, for living in the
 
 Transvaal without a permit. That morning, he was standing near the court in Germiston when a detective inquired his name and asked for his permit. He said he had no permit. Thereupon the detective arrested him on the spot. As soon as Mr. Polak heard of this, he went to Germiston. He saw Mr. Pundit in gaol. On being asked, he replied that he did not at all want to be released on bail, and that he would prefer to remain in goal.
 In the gaol, the gaoler also urged Punditji to offer bail, but he refused to do so, saying that, for the sake of his community and religion, he would rather remain in gaol.
 CONDITION IN GAOL
 He was quite comfortable in gaol. He had all the facilities, such as a living-room, a bathroom, etc. As he himself says, he had fever when he went there. Now he is all right. Arrangements for his meals have been made by the community, and milk and fruits are being supplied to him every day. He did not wish to take anything else.
 SHOWER OF TELEGRAMS
 He received a number of telegrams in gaol, offering him congratulations and asking him to have courage. They were sent by the Natal Indian Congress, the Durban Anjuman-e-Islam, the Durban Memon Committee, the Hindu Dharma Sabha (Durban), the Parsi Committee (Durban), Mr. Vyas (Pretoria), and the Surat Hindu  Association (Durban). In all the telegrams, Punditji was congratulated on going to gaol for the sake of religion and for the struggle of the Indian community.
 CASE ON MONDAY
 Expecting that the case would come up for hearing on Monday, leaders from various places had arrived. Among the gentlemen who had come, there were, from Johannesburg, Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar, Messrs Essop Mia, Emam Abdool Cadir, Omarji Sale, M. S. Coovadia, Jusab Ebrahim, Ahmad Moosaji, Thambi Naidoo, Polak, Mahomed Khan, Gulabbhai, Bhatt, Naranji, Nawab Khan, and Alibhai Akuji; from Pretoria, Messrs Cachalia, Pillay, Vyas and  Manibhai; from Krugersdorp, Mr. Vaja; and from Vereeniging, Mr. Aswat.  About 150 Indians had already collected at the entrance to the court before the case was called up. Many of them had brought garlands and bouquets with them. Mr. Gandhi had brought news at half-past ten that the case would be adjourned but that Mr. Ram Sundar Pundit was likely to be released without bail. In view of this, people were eagerly waiting on the road to receive Punditji.
 Exactly at eleven o’clock, Punditji was brought into the court room. As soon as he came, the court became crowded with Indians. The Public Prosecutor asked for adjournment with a view to enabling Mr. Chamney to come from Pretoria. Mr. Gandhi said:
 My client has been in custody for four days. He does not want to be released on bail. He is not going to leave the Colony. Rather, he will submit to the penalty prescribed by law. Hence, the case can proceed even today. There is no need for any witnesses from Pretoria. However, I shall raise no objection if it is desired to adjourn the case. Only, my client should be released on his personal recognizance.
 The Public Prosecutor said that, since he did not know all the facts of the case, he could not agree with the suggestion that the accused might be released without bail. Mr. Gandhi said that Mr. Pundit was not a man who would abscond. It was the Government that wanted him to run away. What bail could there be for a man who would not leave the Transvaal for the sake of the community, because he had the right to remain there, even though the Government might want to drive him out?
 The magistrate accepted this argument and released Punditji on his personal recognizance.
 CRIES OF “HURRAH!”
 Punditji received an ovation as soon as he came out. There was a shower of flowers. All shook hands [with him]. It was then decided to hold a meeting in the Location and, accordingly, everybody went towards the building of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha.
 MEETING
 On the proposal of Mr. Lal Bahadur Singh, Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar took the chair. Accommodating the guests inside the hall, the residents of Germiston themselves stood outside. Moulvi Saheb made a speech and said that Punditji deserved congratulations. He had served the whole Indian community. He had proved that gaol was indeed a palace. When the time came, he (Moulvi Saheb) too would be ready to go to gaol. It was the duty of Moulvis and priests to take the lead in such times of difficulty.
 Mr. Emam Abdool Cadir said that Ram Sundar  Pundit’s example should put courage into the heart of everyone.
 Mr. Essop Mia said that no one should in the least be afraid of the Government.
 Mr. Gandhi said that, though it was just the beginning of the struggle, there was already a big gain in that Hindus and Muslims were
 fighting unitedly for a public cause.
 Mr. Ahmad Moosaji paid compliments to Punditji and said that he, too, would not get himself registered as long as he lived.
 Mr. Manibhai proposed a vote of thanks on behalf of the  Pretoria Hindu Dharma Sabha.
 Mr. Thambi Naidoo said that the fight would become more exciting only when Punditji went to gaol.
 Mr. Coovadia said that he had no fear whatsoever. It did not appear likely that the Government would do anything to Punditji.
 Mr. Mahomed Khan said that he was proud of those who had carried on picketing, since he was himself one of the pickets.
Mr. Omarji quoted the following Gujarati verse:
 “A woman should give birth to three kinds of men only, one who is generous in donations, one who is a devotee of God, and one who is brave in battle; otherwise, she better remain barren rather than have her light be dimmed.”
 According to this, it was a matter of credit to his mother that Punditji was a brave son.
 Mr. Aswat said that everybody should realize from the example of Punditji that the Registrar’s Office was a raging fire. No one should touch it.
 Mr. Cachalia thanked Punditji and said that those of them at Pretoria who had not yet registered themselves would never do so.
 Mr. Alibhai said that, if Kanmia pickets were not prepared to go to Pretoria, he himself would specially do so.
 Mr. Vyas said that Punditji had courage enough to be prepared for anything. He had agreed to stay on in Pretoria.
 Mr. Lal Bahadur Singh thanked everyone. Mr. Polak hoped that, after Mr. Pundit, it would be the turn of Moulvi Saheb.
 Then, after a few more remarks, Moulvi Saheb dissolved the meeting.
 Refreshments consisting of bananas and oranges, with tea and lemonade, were then served to all.

 BRAVE TAILORS AND WHITE MERCHANT
 Some of the facts of the hardships of tailors here have already been published in this paper. But the case is so important that I give a more detailed account. Mr. T. Allbret had addressed the following letter to tailors:
 It appears from the latest speech of the Colonial Secretary that those Indians who do not conform to the provisions of the new law of the Transvaal Government in respect of Indians will not be given licences and will be arrested and imprisoned, as provided for in the law. We should like, with your assistance, to avoid getting involved in any complications, and we very much regret to have to request you therefore to arrange for cash payment in respect of future transactions between us, and to settle the outstanding bills before December.
 It is hoped that no ulterior motive will be attributed to us. God willing, if your present uncertain condition is brought to a successful end, we shall be quite happy to have the normal business between us resumed.
 We tender our thanks to you for the satisfaction you have given us in your business dealings and  financial transactions with us.
 This is a very polite letter. Though it is not rude, it only means that those who do not get themselves registered will get no credit. Hence, the tailors were annoyed. Had they been cowards, they would have been impelled by fear to get themselves registered. Being brave, they flung back to him all his samples and wrote the following letter with 21 signatures:
 We are in receipt of your notice in Gujarati. We are very sorry to inform you that with effect from today, i.e., November 7, 1907, we do not wish to maintain any account with you. Moreover, we shall not buy goods worth even a single penny from you, for we have taken an oath not to get ourselves registered. We do notwish to violate it in any circumstances, whatever the cost. We shall pay off your outstanding credits to us at our earliest convenience.
 Mr. Allbret got into a fright at this. The boycott was complete. A picket was posted at his shop to watch if anyone bought cloth from there, for, the tailors would refuse an order for stitching if such cloth
 was brought to them. Thereupon, Mr. Allbret pleaded with the people and offered the following apology:
 The notice that we issued in English and Gujarati to our clients has been interpreted to mean that we want them to register, and that we would withhold credit in case they failed to do so. They have accordingly felt offended, and have called for our boycott.
 We need hardly say that nothing could  have  been further from our intention than to offend the sentiments of our customers, and we can naturally understand resentment at any pressure being put upon anyone with reference to compliance or non-compliance with the laws of the Colony. Under our Constitution, we have always believed that everyone is entitled to his own opinion. We, therefore, unreservedly withdraw the letter in question and we can only reiterate our hope that Indians will come out of their terrible struggle successfully and that they will be treated by the Government of the Colony with fairness and justice; and, as an earnest of our good faith and as a token of the good relations that have hitherto subsisted between them and ourselves, we hereby send you a cheque for £25 to help the Indian cause.
 With reference to the boycott, we can only trust that it will be removed, but it depends entirely upon our customers whether to deal with us or not. If they do, we shall be glad to do our best for them and to sell on the usual terms, but we state that our letter has absolutely nothing to do with the boycott. We simply wish to place ourselves right in the matter, and to show that in writing the letter we did not intend to offend anybody.
 We have never heard of such a letter of apology having been written by a white. I think it is a sufficiently polite letter. This incident should raise the prestige of the tailors, and others ought to take a lesson from it. If we are not afraid of the whites, they are not likely to stop credit to us. How can they do so? Do they not want to earn [money]? I have also heard that this firm has had a business of
 £60,000 with Indians during the last five years, in the course of which it has lost so far only £23. If Indians are honest, they will get credit without asking for it.
 MOOSA ISMAIL MIA
 Mr. Moosa Ismail Mia has gone on pilgrimage to Mecca. I offer him greetings. His elder brother, Mr. Essop Mia, is engaged in the holy work of serving the community. In my view, it can be said that both brothers look after the affairs of this world and also attend to the
 claims of the other world. May they always remain devoutly religious and continue to serve the community! What they are doing is far more valuable than earning millions.
 TREACHERY STILL?
 We hear that registers are being secretly issued in Mr. Khamisa’s shop. Nine such registers were given. No applications are received, but those who have applied are given the registers.
 LAW DESTROYS LIFE
 A Chinese, after taking out the register, committed suicide out of shame. This has produced a feeling of revulsion. The President of the Chinese Association, Mr. Quinn, has sent the following letter to the newspapers:
 The Press has reported a Chinese suicide; Before I read the news in the morning papers, I had by our caretaker a letter placed in my hands written in Chinese and signed by the deceased. I give below a translation of the letter:libtech_405_footnote
 From   Chow   Kwai  to	the	Chairman,   the	Chinese Association, November 10, 1907:
 I am going to leave the world, but I must give a public explanation why I intend to commit suicide. Since I came to South Africa I have only been in domestic service. My dialect is quite different from that of the rest of my countrymen, with whom I have very seldom associated. My employer advised me to re-register. At first, I refused to do so, but I was informed that I would be dismissed from my employment. I thought that I should have to lose my situation. Therefore, I was obliged to re-register, but I did not know the degradation that would follow until my friend talked to me about the registration matter and showed me the translation of the law. I found that I would be treated as a slave, which would be a disgrace to myself and my nation. I was not aware of all this before. Now it is too late for me to repent. I cannot look my countrymen in the face. I hope all my countrymen will take warning from my error.
Mr. Quinn comments on the letter as follows:
 You can well imagine my feelings on reading the letter. I immediately took up the papers and saw that the threat was carried out. My Association immediately applied for the body,
 
 and I havejust returned after performing the funeral rites. The cortege was followed by nearly 70 members of the Chinese Association.
 I dismiss with utter contempt the allegation that any threat was held out to the deceased member of my community. But what is the moral of this, to us, tremendous tragedy? I must call a spade a spade. This is not an occasion when I can possibly use soft words: and I do deliberately charge the Transvaal Government with the murder of an innocent man, and this only because he was an Asiatic. The Asiatic Act has placed us in a difficult situation. It has now exacted blood. Will the humanity of the whites of the Transvaal tolerate an Act which has necessitated the tragedy I have described? Or will the public still continue to believe that the Asiatic Act is all for the best, that it is necessary for the protection of the white men of the Transvaal, and that, therefore, if the Asiatics, stupidly in their opinion, take to heart the insult that is offered by the Act, it is not their concern? Such is not the lesson that we would learn from Western civilization.
 SHAHJI SAHEB
 Shahji Saheb’s case came up for hearing on Wednesday. Hundreds of Indians were present. Mr. Mahomed Shahboodeen tried hard to have the case withdrawn, but that could not  be  done. Deposing, he said that he did not want to lodge any complaint. Shahji Saheb had assaulted [him] for violating religion, and he had regarded the assault as a chastisement of a son by a father. Thereupon, the court let off Shahji Saheb with a warning.
 ARREST OF VYAS AND OTHER PICKETS
 Mr. Gavarishanker Vyas, Mr. Lutchman and Mr. Sharfoodeen were arrested while picketing. They have all been released without bail. They had refused to offer it. The case will be heard on the 15th. There is great excitement in Pretoria. Everyone is in high spirits. Telegrams have been sent to congratulate them.
 STIR AMONG WHITES
 The whites are now feeling concerned. Some of them wish to lead a deputation to the Government. It is hoped that we shall be able to give further information later.
 DELEGATES TO CONGRESS
 A meeting of the British Indian Association was held on Wednesday under the chairmanship of Mr. Essop Mia. Many
 members were present. Messrs Fancy, Coovadia, Cachalia, Ahmad Moosaji, Moulvi Saheb Ahmed Mukhtiar, Emam Abdool Cadir and Gandhi were amongthose who spoke. Then Messrs Omar Hajee Amod Zaveri, Ameeroodeen Mahomed Hoosen Fajandar, Hajee Ebrahim Ahmed Dindar, Ahmed Saleji Coovadia, Suliman M. Cassim and Peeran Mahomed were elected delegates to the [Indian National] Congress to be held in Surat. Collection of contributions to the Congress was started at the same time. Mr. Ameeroodeen made a speech, urging a vigorous effort.

The people in Natal were helping them, and would continue to do so. Even Sheth Peeran Mahomed of Durban would not be able to take  a  steamer to India. Mr. Ritch was working hard in England; he should be allowed personal expenses. Everyone should offer his contribution to the Fund that Mr. Fancy was raising for the Indian National Congress. The case of Punditji was being re-examined by General Smuts. That showed how much the Government was scared.

 [ENCLOSURES]
 The following resolutions were passed at a Mass Meeting of Indians held under the auspices of the Natal Indian Congress on the evening of Thursday, the 14th day of November, l 907 .
 The copy of the cablegram below was also passed and adopted, the meeting resolving that copies of the same be sent to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Honourable the Colonial Secretary, Transvaal:
 Resolution No. l: That this meeting of Indians, representing the Indian population of Natal, has heard with deep regret of the injustice and hardship the Transvaal Legislature are meting out to loyal British Indians.
 Resolution No. 2: That this meeting resolves to send letters and telegrams of sympathy to Ram Sundar Pundit and his family, and to congratulate him upon the stand he has made to secure for himself the right of a priest to minister to the spiritual needs of his congregation. It is further resolved to suspend business [for] one day throughout Natal; this to be effected by the closing of all Indian shops and places of business on Saturday, the 16th instant, in order to more practically place on record the disabilities of the Indians in the Transvaal. This meeting also extends to the Hindu congregation its heartfelt sympathy upon being deprived of a spiritual leader and guide, and grieves to think that any Government should be so unreasonable as to indirectly interfere with the due performance of religious rites and ceremonies by depriving the Hindus of a religious guide and that copies of these resolutions be sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Transvaal Government, and the English and Indian Press.
 Cablegram—Natal Indians respectfully protest against arrest and sentence of Ram Sundar Pundit as being undue interference with the personal liberty and religion of British Indians in a British Colony. Request intervention by Home Government for sake of Empire.

 Every Indian must have observed from the accounts of the Associationlibtech_414_footnotethat it has very little  money  at  present.  This  is  a  big struggle. Though much of the work is done without being paid for, some expenditure has to be incurred, and is incurred, in  fact. Telegrams are sent, hundreds of letters are written, a lot of typing is done, things are printed and newspapers have to be paid for. All these are small items of expenditure but when we think of the total, it amounts to a big figure.
 There have been some collections in most places, but these have not been remitted to the Association. Those who have collected contributions, and other Indians too, are required to remit the money to the Association as early as possible. A receipt will be duly sent to everyone. We expect that no one will be tardy in this matter. Contributions sent by individuals will also be accepted.

 [THE EDITOR
THE TRANSVAAL LEADER
JOHANNESBURG
SIR,]
 I had the privilege of being present at the trial of my co-priest Ram Sundar Pundit. A thought struck me most forcibly, that there must be something radically wrong in the laws of the Transvaal. As everyone now knows, I struck Imam Kamali in the heat of the moment for what I considered was a breach of the Koranic injunctions. I was fined £5 for it, with the option of imprisonment. An unkind friend, who is good enough to describe himself as my disciple, paid the fine, and I escaped gaol. I struck again Mahomed Shahboodeen, who, in his evidence, admitted he had broken his oath on the Koran, and said my striking him was as from father to son. An indulgent court, therefore, let me off with the warning that I may at any time be required to come up for sentence.
 Ram Sundar Pundit, who has, so far as I am aware, and I know something of him, never hurt anybody, was sentenced to be  imprisoned for one month, because he did not hold a piece of paper authorising him, a British subject, to cater for the religious wants of his fellow-countrymen in a British Colony.
 According to what I have always understood, if any man deserved gaol, it was I, and yet it was possible for somebody to buy what he thought would be freedom for me; whereas Ram Sundar Pundit must be shut out for one month practically from all intercourse with those whom he has been in the habit of meeting every day, and cut off from his religious work. The thought shakes me to the marrow. I feel that I am in gaol and Ram Sundar Pundit is free. May God give him peace and courage.

  "
272,,PUNDITJI’S PATRIOTIC SERVICE,"
    
 The service that Ram Sundar Pundit has rendered by going to gaol is such that no service by any other Indian remaining outside can equal it, however great that Indian may be. Punditji has opened the gates of our freedom. All of us can enter by that gate. The Congress President is right in saying that by going to gaol, Punditji  has  sanctified it. All innocent people who go to gaol make it holy.
 We think Punditji and his family are fortunate. His fame has spread throughout South Africa. It will spread in India too. This is the result of real service. It is a real service, we think, that Punditji has rendered by unhesitatingly offering himself as sacrifice for the sake of the country.
 What will the community do now? This question can have only one answer. If, after sending Punditji to gaol, any Indian submits to the obnoxious law, we do not think he deserves the name of man. The fight that we have taken up is not a children’s game. There can be no immediate fruits of success to enjoy. What we wish to achieve is no ordinary thing. We shall have to undergo sacrifices worthy of it. We shall have to go to gaol in such numbers and till such time as may be necessary to convince the Government that we are in earnest and not merely making an outward show.
 This case has proved that the Government’s talk of being able to deport [people] was baseless. Weak-kneed Indians need particularly to bear this fact in mind.
 The biggest gain that we see from Punditji’s case is that Hindus and Muslims have become completely united. Both have realized that this work concerns all Indians. We shall be content if it is said that this has been the only gain of this struggle and of this case.

273,,TRIAL OF PICKETS,"
    
 In the case of the pickets arrested in Pretoria, we have won an unexpected success. No one had expected that they would not even be examined. During the trial, the witness for prosecution  himself admitted that no one had assaulted Lutchman. This case shows that the
 Government has lost its strength. It has therefore grown desperate. It is laughed at by its own newspapers.
 We earnestly hope that the courage shown by the pickets will be shown by others as well.

274,,DELEGATES TO CONGRESS,"
    
 The resolution passed by the Transvaal British Indian Association to send delegates to the [Indian National] Congress deserves to be welcomed. The strong appeal that will be made at the Congress by the five prominent businessmen from here attending it cannot but have some good effect. That appeal will have been made at the right time, that is, when many Indians in the Transvaal will be enjoying the luxury of gaol.
 There is a heavy responsibility on the delegates. They should carry on a vigorous campaign throughout India. Mr. Ameeroodeen, who goes after having seen things for himself here, has the heaviest responsibility. Even after the Congress is over, they will have much work to do.
 We intend to publish a photograph of Mr. Ameeroodeen in the next issue.

 "
275,,WHEN WILL CAPE INDIANS WAKE UP?,"
    
 We have repeatedly said that there is an urgent need for Indians in the Cape to wake up. We gave an account in the last issue of the efforts being made there to prevent licences being issued to Indians. In view of this, we ask the Cape Indians once again how long they will remain asleep. Only a little while ago, we were obliged to point out that the Indians must thank their own indifference for the tyranny of the Cape Immigration Act. After that, there were some signs of awakening but it seems the awakening has again subsided. In the result, while the hardships of immigration yet remain to be overcome, they find the problem of licences staring them in the face. We must say that, even for the loss of the right of appeal to the Supreme Court, Indians themselves are for the most part responsible. On that question it was necessary for the people in the Cape to take a lesson from the
 conditions in Natal and put up a strong fight. But it is to be regretted that this was not done. They remained altogether indifferent while the Bill was before the Parliament. It needs to be dinned into the minds of Indians in South Africa that, having come to this country, they cannot afford to be asleep all the time. We are living here surrounded by an armed camp. All people are against us. If we remain idle and do not look after the interests of our community, we and our descendants will very likely be reduced to a miserable plight in future. Hence, we again ask our brethren in the Cape to be alert on this question from today, lest the enemies who have been giving them pin-pricks every now and then and are determined to uproot them altogether reduce them to the condition now prevailing in the Transvaal.

276,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 RAM SUNDAR PUNDIT’S CASE
 A question has been raised whether this case was tried under the new law or the old one, but it is quite easy to decide this.  The summons issued to him itself quoted Section 17 of the new law, and if that Section were not applicable, Punditji could have been defended along another line. Moreover, the readers of this paper know that, even in the letter which Punditji wrote, he had stated that he was also unable to take out a temporary permit under the new law. Hence, in my judgment, this case falls under the new law. Not only that, it is a case which very much strengthens our hands. For, it has covered many legal points. There was an attack on religion! Moreover, it has been shown how absurd was the reason for not extending the permit. And, in any case, Punditji is considered to be one of the leaders which means that they have laid hands on a leader. Besides, he is a priest and, therefore, not likely to have interfered with anyone. In view of all these facts, the case can obviously be regarded as a very strong one. That is the impression made on the minds of the whites, too.
 COMMENT IN “PRETORIA NEWS”
 Commenting on this, Pretoria News says:libtech_421_footnote
 There seems to be no very good reason for suddenly declining to permit the Hindus the ministrations and consolations of their religion. By all
 
 accounts, if Mr. Smuts carries out his threat to enforce the law, they will need these consolations to fortify them in the difficult time through which they will have to pass. It seems to us that the Government has blundered. It is a mistake to make martyrs, especially religious martyrs, and Mr. Pundit today is a religious martyr upheld by a conscientious belief that he is doing right, and supported by theapplause and admiration of his  countrymen  and co-religionists. Quite what the Government has gained is difficult to see.
 We see now that as a result of the case against the Pundit, the sympathies of the whites, too, have been drawn towards Indians. The case is considered so important that the local newspapers have devoted much space to it.
 MORE SYMPATHY
 There is a letter in the newspapers by Mr. Phillips, who is a prominent personality in Johannesburg, is himself a priest and President of the Association of Clergymen; the letter is worthy of note. He welcomes the offer of voluntary registration by Indians and recommends its acceptance by the Government. We reproduce the letterlibtech_422_footnoteelsewhere.
 Further, Mr. MacIntyre writes in the Leader that here only criminals are required to give ten finger-prints, and that if the Government were to abandon the idea of ten finger-prints,  there would be an annual gain to it of £500. Thus, we are receiving support from all sides. If voluntary registration is accepted and the taking of ten finger-prints is dropped, we get all that we ask for.
 CASE AGAINST PRETORIA PICKETS
 Commenting on this case, Pretoria News writes as under:
 The Government scored nothing over the case of Ram Sundar Pundit, and it scored less over the arrest of certain pickets in Pretoria on Thursday. This case has proved beyond any doubt that it is not the pickets who use threats; rather, it is the Government that uses intimidation to get people to register.
 If, in spite of these signs, there is any Indian who blackens his face, he will definitely not deserve the name of Indian.
 STRIKE
 When Punditji was sentenced to gaol, shops everywhere in the Transvaal remained closed. The hawkers stopped going on their rounds. Newspaper boys stopped selling newspapers, unmindful of loss. The news agency refused to give them copies the next day. This
 
 made the subscribers angry. The news paper boys had to write letters of apology to their patrons, and even now their difficulties have not come to an end. While, on the one hand, the whole body of people was prepared to suffer loss, on the other hand, there was  a businessman in Offerton, Mr. Kamalkhan by name; who kept his shop open. Likewise in Heidelberg, Messrs Khota, Abou Mian Camroodeen and Adam Mamuji kept their shops open. This has caused resentment in the whole of the Indian community.
 CONGRATULATIONS TO BLACKLEGS
 I have had to write bitter things about Mr. Khamisa and his friends. I am glad that I have now got an opportunity to give them compliments. Mr. Khamisa and all others who had their hands and faces blackened kept their shops closed for the sake  of  the community. Everyone did the same in Pietersburg. This fact proves that a mass of water cannot be divided into two by striking at it with a stick. It can never happen that the people of the same country will be altogether divided against one another. When the poison  of self-interest disappears, the bond of sympathy for the community cannot but assert itself.
 CHAMNEY’S PRANKS
 There are people who cannot do anything good. At present, Mr. Chamney is in such a state of mind. By harassing us under some pretext or other, that gentleman wants to make us take out registers. His latest performance is that he has made arrangements with the blind Portuguese Government to have those who do not take out permits subjected to harassment. A notice is displayed in the office of the Portuguese Consul to the effect that an Indian wishing to go to India via Delagoa Bay will be given a permit to enter Delagoa Bay only if he produces the new register and, in case he does not do so, only if he declares in writing that he does not intend returning to the Transvaal. This is mere harassment. It shows that they want to make Indians take out the new registers by holding out all kinds of inducements. There is nothing else, by way of compulsion, that is likely to succeed. The Indian community will not get frightened if permits for Delagoa Bay are not issued. Those who wish to go to India by some other route will be able to do so. Even then, efforts are being made for this.
 SUGGESTION BY “THE TRANSVAAL LEADER”
 The Transvaal Leader suggests that the Government  should  meet the leaders of the Indian community and find a compromise on the question of the law in consultation with them. The Government will regret it later if it does not arrive at such a compromise. The

 Shahji Saheb has felt much concerned at Punditji’s imprison- ment and he has therefore written the following letterlibtech_423_footnoteto the newspa- pers:

An indulgent court, therefore, let me off with the warning that I may at any time be required to come up for sentence.
 Ram Sundar Pundit, who has, so far as I am aware, and I know something of him, never hurt anybody, was sentenced to be imprisoned for one month, because he did not hold a piece of paper authorising him, a British subject, to cater for the religious wants of his fellow-countrymen in a British Colony.
 According to what I have always understood, if any man deserved gaol, it was I, and yet it was possible for somebody to buy what he thought would be freedom for me; whereas Ram Sundar Pundit must be shut out for one month practically from all intercourse with those whom he has been in the habit of meeting every day, and cut off from his religious work. The thought shakes me to the marrow. I feel that I am in gaol and Ram Sundar Pundit is free. May God give him peace and courage.
 SYMPATHY FROM CAPE TOWN
 The African Indian Association at Cape Town has sent a  telegram to the [British Indian] Association expressing its concern and sympathy, and has also sent a telegram to the High Commissioner saying that he should intervene, that the grievances of Indians should be redressed and that Ram Sundar Pundit should be released. Such telegrams have been received from many places and I intend to give the names of the places and the contents of the telegrams next week.
 
 TELEGRAM TO AMEEROODEEN
 Mr. Ameeroodeen’s partner, Mr. Abdool Gafoor, has sent the following telegram to him:
 Your responsibility is great. Do your duty with courage. Build high hopes on you. India’s prestige depends on the struggle here. Do not rest till we become free and the freedom of our descendants is assured.
 DESPERATE EFFORTS OF REGISTRATION OFFICE
 Lutchman, who gave evidence in the case against the pickets, was arrested for giving false evidence. In fact, there was no case. Hence he was let off. But Lutchman’s case shows that any Indian who goes to take out a register will bring disgrace to his community and will put his fellow-countrymen into trouble, and yet he himself may not be saved. This case has turned out to be exactly like that of Karim Jamal.

 [JOHANNESBURG,
 November 24, 1907]
 Mr. Gandhi spoke about the ability of the delegates.libtech_424_footnotelibtech_425_footnoteHe said that since there would be other speakers at the session, there was no need at present to incur further expenditure. Because of the paucity of funds, the question of nominating additional delegates would have to be dropped. Time was also short. As regards the Punjabis and the Pathans, a communication would soon be addressed to Lord Selborne. Mr. Gandhi exhorted the Turks to remain steadfast. The whites had held a meeting and it appeared from a report of it  that  the Government was getting exhausted. If the community remained firm, every white would come over to their side. The deputation of whites would leave in December. The Government doubted whether the Indians would definitely hold out to the end. But Mr. Gandhi argued that those who worked with courage and faith in God were bound to succeed. Then, speaking of the courage of the Pretoria pickets, he said that Major Fuge continued seeing the pickets every day. Mr. Cody tried to dissuade him from doing so, but he would not  listen  to anyone. And so on.

   Your 		Petitioners are Your Highness’ 		subjects, and 		have migrated 		to the 		Transvaal for 		earning an 		honest livelihood.  Your 		Petitioners have most of 		them a large 		stake in the 		Transvaal.  Your 		Petitioners venture 		respectfully to draw 		Your Highness’ 		attention to the 		Asiatic Law 		Amendment Act 		passed by 		the Transvaal Parliament.

Your 		Petitioners attach 		hereto copy of the 		submission made 		to the Right Hon’ble 		the Secretary 		of State 		for the 		Colonies in connection with the Act, wherein are set forth all the objections.  As 		Imperial intervention 		has been directly 		refused and as 		the law 		in question 		is considered 		exceptionally humiliating and 		insulting and 		as your 		Petitioners are 		bound by 		a solemn 		oath not to 		submit to 		the Act, they 		have entered 		upon what 		has been termed a 		passive resistance 		crusade and have 		risked the loss 		of all their 		belongings. The Local 		Government have 		threatened 		imprisonment, 		deportation and 		other penalties, 		all [of] 		which your Petitioners 		consider are bearable 		and worth 		suffering in preference 		to bearing 		the yoke imposed 		by the 		Act above mentioned.  In 		the humble 		opinion of 		your Petitioners, 		it will 		strengthen the 		hands of 		the Imperial 		Government as also 		the Indian Government 		and it 		will encourage 		your Petitioners 		very greatly 		to receive 		Your Highness’ 		sympathy and active intervention.

Your 	Petitioners are mostly 	holders of permits 	and registration 	certificates issued to 	them under the 	Peace Preservation 	Ordinance and 	Law 3 of 	1885. Your 	Petitioners are not 	pre-war residents 	of the 	Transvaal, but 	were granted 	permits in exchange 	for discharge 	certificates issued by their respective officers.  With 	the exception of a 	few, all are at present 	without employment, 	largely because of 	the struggle 	against the Asiatic 	Registration Act. In 	some cases, their 	employers have dismissed them 	for non-registration, 	and, in other 	cases, on 	application for 	employment, your 	Petitioners have 	been told that they could get it, if 	they allowed themselves 	to be registered 	under the new 	Act.  In 	the humble 	opinion of 	your Petitioners, 	it is not 	possible for 	them to submit 	to the 	Asiatic Act, 	inasmuch as 	it subjects them 	to humiliation never 	experienced by 	them in 	India, and 	reduces them 	to a 	state which is 	incompatible with 	their self-respect and 	dignity as soldiers.

         [Tuesday, 	November 26, 1907]  ACCOUNTS 	OF ASSOCIATION  	These accountslibtech_434_footnoteare 	  published  along  with  the  advertisements, and I bring them to 	the notice of every Indian in the Transvaal. It can be seen from 	them that the Association is now left with a sum of  	£140.18.1 only. Moreover, £95 out of this was given by Mr. 	Allbret. The Association has undertaken a Hereulean task. Compared 	to that task, the money is very little. We do not know of any other 	body working economically as this Association. Its recurring 	expenditure is under £10. But now there will be increased 	expenditure on account of telegrams, etc. There is no expenditure on 	account of rent. Mostly, the burden of expenditure is being borne by 	Johannesburg. If  the  example of Rustenburg is followed by other 	places, even that will bring a little relief to the Association. 	Only recently, a sum of £15 was received from Rustenburg. Its 	example deserves to be emulated by other towns.  HOW 	THEY BESIEGE 	US  	I have already pointed out how Mr. Chamney has seen to it that we 	find it difficult to go to Delagoa Bay.

 is not to be given. Neither of these things is objectionable in itself. But if the Government wants to harass us, it should not be allowed to do so. All these annoyances are incidental to a struggle. They need not frighten us. The question as to what will happen now ought not to occur to us at all.
 EXAMPLE OF HEROISM
 Mr. Mahomed Moosa Parekh writes from Newcastle that he will take up residence at Wakkerstroom before December next specially with the object of defying the law. He adds:
 What would it matter even if a thousand such [Registration] Offices were set up? No one who has sincerely taken an oath once in the name of God, and with faith in the truth of his Prophet, will ever carry the burden of slavery on his head.
 I wish Mr. Parekh and all other Indians maintain such spirit till the end.
 ASIATIC EATING-HOUSES
 The reader will remember that the Municipality had framed regulations on this subject requiring the appointment of a white deputy. The Association had made a representation against this. The Government has now ordered the regulations to be amended and the Municipality has agreed to do so.
 REGULATIONS CONCERNING CABS
 It was being talked about for a long time that  a  regulation should be made prohibiting a black person from riding in a first-class cab. Now the Municipality has passed such a regulation. It provides that a black barrister or physician can use such a cab. This means that a black barrister in rags or one who is drunk can ride in a first-class cab, but a wealthy and well-dressed, Indian merchant cannot! Moreover, a barrister may ride in it, but not his wife and children. There is no limit to the stupidity of the people who make such laws. The Association has sent a representation to the Government against this regulation.
 RESOLUTION OF STANGER INDIANS
 Meetings have been held and resolutions passed at many places in connection with Ram Sundar Pundit’s imprisonment.  This happened in Stanger, too. The Association has received telegrams of sympathy under the signatures of Mr. Dawad Mahomed Sidaat, Mr. Ahmed Moosa Metar, Mr. Manilal Chaturbhai Patel and Mr. Ahmed Mitha.
 
 The Association has not been able to send letters of thanks to all those who have sent telegrams and passed resolutions, for it was impossible to do so. Moreover, where people do a certain thing as a matter of duty and with a patriotic motive, no thanks are necessary. This is not the time for mutual compliments or expression of thanks. Recognition of duty done itself amounts to thanks.
 KHOLWAD MADRESSA
 Mr. Gulam Mahomed Ajam writes from Bombay that he has received a sum of £92l.10.0. He is looking about for a building to be purchased with that money. But he finds the sum too small to buy a good house with. He has also received the deed of trust and power of attorney.
 LICENCES IN MINING AREA
 The Government had refused, under the Gold Law, to issue licences at Johannesburg and other places, and a situation had arisen in which it would have been necessary to take the matter to a court of law. But now another communication has been received from the Government saying that in view of the struggle against the new law, it does not want to fight on that question, and that a licence will be issued to anyone who applies for it. This reply is noteworthy. The Government is afraid of incurring odium by launching such cases. Will it not be afraid of incurring odium when putting 7,000 people into gaol?
 MEETING OF KONKANIS
 A meeting of Konkanis was held on Sunday last to find out if they were all firm. They met in the Hamidia Hall. Mr. Malim Mahomedtook the chair on the occasion. Mr. Abdool Gani said in his speech that he was determined not to yield till the last. He would not break the oath which he had joined in administering to others.  Speeches were made at the meeting by Mr. Ismail Khan, Mr. Shahboodeen Hasan, Mr. Hasan Mian (of Roodepoort), Mr. Abdul Gafur and others, and they all expressed the same view that they should not submit to the law, whatever the cost. Even in regard to the question that was raised whether everyone working in a shop should get himself registered or not, the previous decision was reiterated, namely, that it was not at all necessary to do so.
 COLLECTING FUNDS FOR CONGRESS
 The collections here for the [Indian] National Congress have exceeded £50. There may be still further contributions. I shall send
 the list next week. Out of the sum mentioned above, £25 is sent to Mr. Ameeroodeen for the present. If more were needed, it was resolved to send up to £50. Some expenditure was also incurred in sending cables from here to India about the delegation. All these accounts will be published.
 APATHY OF DELAGOA BAY INDIANS
 I see from the newspapers here that, if the Indian community at Delagoa Bay does not become alert, it will be reduced to a miserable plight. The Chamber there has resolved that henceforth Indians will not be allowed to vote. If the Indians there continue to put up with all this without any protest, it will be a great disgrace. Moreover, efforts are being made to put obstacles in the path of Indians going there from the Transvaal. It would be good if these things put  a  little courage into Delagoa Bay Indians. We strongly urge all  Indians having contacts with wealthy people there to go on writing to them.
 PETITION TO GAEKWAR
 The subjects of His Highness the Gaekwar have submitted the following petition to him in connection with the new law, signed by nearly 150 persons.libtech_435_footnote
 WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN DECEMBER?
 Many of our readers will be eager to read the answer to this question. I have reserved the question for the last place in my letter, but it would have deserved the first.
 WHAT CAN BE DONE
 Before deciding what should be done, let us consider what can be done. We have seen that the Government has no authority  to expelus with physical force. The only thing that remains is putting us into gaol. Under Section 8 of the Act, the police can demand the new register from every Indian. If he does not have it, he can be produced before a magistrate. There he will get a notice to leave the country within a specified period. When the order is disregarded, the person will be arrested again, and can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to six months. When a person is tried under this Section, the magistrate has no power to impose a fine. If we read the Act, we shall find that the court can order anyone to apply for the register. Instead of trying a person in this manner, the Government can also prosecute him for
 
 not making such application. The penalty for the offence of not making an application is a fine of £100 or imprisonment. The Government can deal with every Indian in this manner, which means that every Indian can be put into gaol. But there is a great difference between being able to do something and actually doing it. I dismiss as impossible the idea that the Government can arrest every Indian and put him into gaol.
 SOME ARRESTS CERTAIN
 But some Indians will definitely be arrested. I believe that the first round of arrests will include a hundred people at the most.
 TESTING OUR METTLE
 It is likely that a few Indians will be arrested at every place with a view to testing our mettle. If that happens, our struggle will come to an end earlier. If there are simultaneous arrests at every place, people should not get into a panic. If such arrests take place, it will not be possible for Mr. Gandhi to go everywhere. There will be no need for him to do so. Immediately a person is arrested, a telegram should be sent to the Association (BIAS) at Johannesburg.
 NO APPLICATION FOR BAIL
 The arrested person must not offer bail. A lawyer is also not to be engaged. When he attends the court on the day of hearing, he should state:
 I oppose the law. I am a bona fide resident of the Transvaal. I hold a genuine permit. Under this law we cease to be human beings. We also lose our religion. I will not therefore submit to it. Our whole community is against it. If the Government serves me with a notice to leave, that also will not be complied with. Hence, whatever penalty is to be inflicted on me may be inflicted just now. If a notice has to be given, it may please be as short as possible.
 This should be said by the person himself through   an interpreter.
 NOTICE WILL BE SERVED
 Thereupon, the chances are that a notice will be served. Even after the expiry of the period of notice, no lawyer will be needed. The person concerned will remain free till the notice-period expires. During that time, he may make whatever arrangements he thinks
 
 necessary concerning his personal affairs.
 AFTER EXPIRY OF NOTICE-PERIOD
 After the expiry of the notice-period, he will be arrested again. No further statement is to be made on this occasion. He should only say: I have nothing to add to what I stated earlier. He should then go through whatever sentence is inflicted. People who remain outside should immediately send a telegram about the sentence given. The telegram should contain particulars of whether the person has  a family, where it lives, whether he has left it to the community to provide for its maintenance or whether he has resources of his own, etc.
 It should be remembered that, wherever necessary, the dependants [of the arrested person] will be maintained by the community till the day of his release from gaol. The best thing will be for every place to assume responsibility for its own people, just as the responsibility for the family of Ram Sundar Pundit was assumed by the Indians of Germiston. But if this is not possible the Association will certainly make some arrangements,
 If they do not strike at Johannesburg and, consequently, Mr. Gandhi is not occupied there, he will run up to any place where Indians (bona fide residents) may have been arrested and he will not charge fees [for their defence]. It will be proper for the  place concerned to meet his travelling expenses. Even if this is not done, the Association will pay them and Mr. Gandhi will make himself available at that place.
 There is no need to say anything about the business of a person sent to gaol. He will have made arrangements in advance for it. The Government will not be able to force anyone to close down his shop. Nor can it auction his goods to recover the fine. It also does not appear likely that all the persons in a shop will be arrested at the same time. Even while in gaol, one can look after one’s business: one may write letters or send messages.
 WHAT SHOULD THOSE WHO REMAIN OUTSIDE DO?
 After one or more fellow Indians are taken to gaol, those left behind should mark time outside. That is the best way. If anyone gets into a fright and runs of to get himself registered lest he himself be attacked, he will have proved himself an enemy of the country and
 brought disgrace to the Indian community.
 REAL TEST
 This will come only when the people, instead  of growing nervous on account of the leaders having been arrested, will be further emboldened to defy the law. It should be distinctly remembered that only when this is proved beyond doubt will the law be repealed.
 ON DECEMBER 2
 On December 2 Indians need not keep themselves confined within the four walls of their houses. Hawkers need not get frightened and stop going on their rounds; they must come out fearlessly to attend to their business. On that day and on the days following, people must go on with their work as usual as if nothing has happened. This is a struggle for freedom. Hence courage will be required at every step. Without courage, then, there can be no success.
 HALOO’ S TURN-ABOUT
 Mr. Haloo has apologized [at a meeting] in a mosque for having blackened his face and has sent the following letterlibtech_436_footnoteto the Registrar:
 SIR,
 I beg respectfully to return herewith the registration  certificate granted to me on the 12th day of October, 1907. In doing so, I am quite aware that it is not possible for me to cast off the yoke of the Act I have undertaken to bear; but that is, under the circumstances in which I am placed, the least I can do. Indeed, when I went to your temporary office in Von Brandis Square, Johannesburg, I had conflicting emotions—on the one hand was my creditor pressing me to submit to the Act or threatening to sell me out, on the other was the shame I would have to incur by reason of my submission. But I did not then realize the magnitude of the shame; I yielded to the threat.
 I now see that my existence has become intolerable. I am shunned by my countrymen and my co-religionists. My sister and my other relations write to me disowning me entirely and telling me that, in breaking my oath that I had solemnly taken, I have become an unfit member of my family. Even if I should retain my possessions, I see that they would be more a burden to me than anything else, with all those who have associated with me and with whom I had the privilege of associating putting me outside their pale. I was one of those who at the mass meeting at Pretoria on the 31st July last inveighed against the weakkneed Memons for having yielded to worldly
 
 
 
 temptation and broken their solemn obligation and accepted the slavery of the Act. When the same trial stared me in the face, I yielded. The result of it I cannot undo, but in returning this certificate, I derive the satisfaction of having regained to a certain extent my conscience.
 I only trust that my example will be a warning to my other countrymen, and that they will never even look at your Office, so long as it is the Registration Act which you may administer.
 Moreover, while sending this letter to the newspapers,  Mr. Haloo has also stated that the report that had appeared in some of them about his dog having been poisoned was false.
 HAMIDIA ISLAMIC SOCIETY’S LETTER
 This Society has addressed the following letter to the President of the All-India Muslim League:libtech_437_footnote
 My Society invites your attention to the question of the Asiatic Act. You must have seen the circular letter addressed to Indian Mahomedans by the Hamidia Islamic Society. We have approached all Indian associations without regard to their local political colour. On this question there is no difference of opinion, and it is felt that there should be a united and emphatic protest in this connection. My Society, therefore, trusts that the All India Muslim League will protest against the Act.
 WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO DEPUTATION OF WHITES?
 I have already reported that some whites intended taking a deputation to the Government. The deputation has not gone till now, which has made some Indians impatient. I must say that this impatience is a sign of fear. What difference will it make whether the deputation is taken or not? We depend on our own strength. But, with a view to reassuring the timid, I may state that preparations for the deputation are going on. They are only eager to know what stuff we are made of. That cannot be known before December; that is why the deputation has not gone yet. However, one should not be surprised if those who depend only on outside help are disappointed.
 CASE AGAINST PICKET
 Mr. P. K. Naidoo, who was a picket, had a violent altercation with another Madrasi about registration. The Madrasi was beaten up because he had taken out a register. Mr. Naidoo’s case came up for hearing today (Tuesday). He was fined £10. The fine was paid by his
 
 friends. Commenting on this, the magistrate said that since the case related to the question of registration, he should in fact have been sentenced to imprisonment instead of a fine. My own sympathies are not in the least with Mr. Naidoo. Such cases only do harm to us. There is no place in this struggle for the use of force. Besides, paying a fine for getting released was still worse; that the fine was paid by friends involves them also in disgrace. Those who want to prevent people by force from getting themselves registered do not understand the nature of this grand, religious-cum-patriotic struggle.
 PETITION BY PUNJABIS
 The Punjabis have addressed a petition to Lord Selborne which we translate below:libtech_438_footnote
 Your Petitioners are old Indian soldiers, and represent 43 Punjabi Mahomedans, 13 Sikhs, and 54 Pathans.
 Your Petitioners are all British subjects, and were most of them brought to the Colony in connection with the Transport Corps raised at the time of the late war. When your Petitioners came to South Africa, they were told by their officers that it would be possible for them, at the end of the war,  to settle in any part of South Africa.
 Some of your Petitioners have fought under the British flag during the Chitral Expedition, the Tirah Campaign, and other expeditions.
 With the exception of a few, all are at present without employment, largely because of the struggle against the Asiatic Registration Act. In some cases, their employers have dismissed them for non-registration, and, in other cases, your Petitioners have been told that they could get employment if they allowed themselves to be registered under the new Act.
 In the humble opinion of your Petitioners, it is not possible for them to submit to the Asiatic Act, inasmuch as it subjects them to humiliation never experienced by them in India. How could they sacrifice their self-respect and dignity as soldiers?
 Your Petitioners cannot return to India and find the wherewithal to support themselves.
 Your Petitioners now venture respectfully to claim Your Excellency’s protection in your capacity as High Commissioner and trustee of Imperial interests in South Africa.
 Your Petitioners, therefore, respectfully pray that Your Excellency will be pleased to secure them such relief as may be possible under the circumstances.
 
 
 MEMORIAL MEETING OF CHINESE	[Wednesday]
 The Chinese Association held a memorial meeting today (Wednesday) to commemorate the Chinaman who had committed suicide. No one present at the meeting could help feeling admiration for the Chinese. Their beautiful hall was adorned with black cloth. On one side in the hall there was a photograph of the Chinaman who had died. In the centre were standing all those who had served as pickets. Surrounding them on all sides were chairs which were occupied by invitees. About a thousand Chinese, with flowers in their hands, gently passed by the photograph, praying for the soul of the departed one, and went out through the door opposite. All these men were neatly dressed. Then they sang dirges in Chinese, after which there was a meeting in another hall. The hall was packed to capacity and the chairman, Mr. Quinn, made a speech in Chineseand English. He was followed by Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Polak who commented upon the law. The meeting was then dissolved. Their unity, neatness and courage—all these three things deserve to be emulated by us.
 ASSAULT IN PRETORIA
 A case is going on against a Pathan, named Banutkhan, for having assaulted Mr. Hajee Ebrahim, who is a blackleg Full reports about it have not yet arrived. But it appears that Banutkhan dealt a blow with a stick to Mr. Ebrahim for having taken out a register and broken the oath. Hajee Ebrahim tossed him to the ground and pressed him down. To get free from his clutches, Banutkhan bit Ebrahim on the cheek. At first the amount of bail for Banutkhan was fixed at
 £100, for Mr. Chamney had reported that Banutkhan had threatened him too. Half-way through the proceedings, the amount of bail was reduced to £50. The magistrate fined Banutkhan £20 and he has paid the amount.
 LETTER FROM MANILAL DESAI
 Mr. Manilal Desai, the  chief  picket  at  Pretoria,  has  sent  a letter to the newspapers stating that the pickets do not at all assault people or use force, but only explain the subtle implications of the law with gentleness and in a friendly manner, and point out the hardships caused by it.

He had often heard it remarked that the Chinese people did not value human life as other people did, but if he at any time had any illusions on that point, they were set at rest after what he had seen that afternoon. He wished General Smuts could have attended the gathering to witness the great ceremonial through which they had passed. He thought, in that case, that General Smuts would have thought twice before saying he had put his foot down and was going to keep it there. He (Mr. Gandhi) had taken upon himself the responsibilityof advising the fighting of the Asiatic Act, and he still felt he was doing what was right, proper and just. He gave that advice to his countrymen and he had no hesitation in giving the same advice to them as fellow Asiatics. He tried hard, and for a long time, to draw a line between British subjects and non-British subjects. He pleaded hard with the Government here and with the Imperial Government that at least there should be a discrimination between British subjects and other Asiatics. “No,” was the emphatic answer both from the Imperial  Government and the local Government, and although he claimed for his countrymen and himself all the rights that should properly belong to British subjects, that claim was summarily rejected and British Indians and other Asiatics were classed alike.
 Adversity had made them strange bed-fellows in this struggle. It was perfectly true that in spite of the position, British Indians still, somehow or other, clung to the British-subject idea, and they felt that some day or other, they would be able to make good the plea. So far as that was concerned, the Chinese fight was different to the British Indian fight, but so far as the incidence of this wretched legislation was concerned, the Chinese fight was identical with that of the British Indians, and it was because the law pressed equally heavily on both that both were fighting it. If any justification were to be sought for repealing the Asiatic Act, he thought there were two instances. The first in importance was undoubtedly the death of a countryman of his Chinese audience. Their countryman had sacrificed himself for what he thought
 
 was a mistake. A miserable attempt had been made to show that the man had given his life for other reasons, but the fact stood out prominently that the man had given his life for the sake of this wretched, miserable Asiatic Act. The other instance he referred   to was among his (the speaker’s) own countrymen. A man perfectly guiltless and striving to live his life as he best knew how, serving the spiritual needs of his countrymen, had been sent to jail, and was today in default in Johannesburg simply because of this Asiatic Act.libtech_441_footnoteAll sorts of charges had been made against him, and there was not an iota of proof of the seditious charges. He (Mr. Gandhi) could only say that an Act which had exacted already this heavy price could never be submitted to, either by [the] Chinese or by British Indians, if they were true to themselves, if they were true to their countrymen, and if they valued their honour above anything else. The struggle was a moral and religious one. He reminded them that virtue was its own reward, and said if this was a question of conflicting rights between Europeans and Asiatics, he could understand the position taken up by the Government. But he felt convinced that this was not a struggle between Europeans and Asiatics. General Smuts was reputed to be very strong, and so he was; but so far as the Asiatics were concerned, that strength remained to be proved. He submitted that they were violating the consciences of thirteen thousand British Indians and thirteen hundred Chinese, and that they had chosen the rottenest way of doing a thing which could have been done in a better way long enough ago. After the 2nd December, their freedom was not their own, but, whether arrested or not, they would keep before their minds the spirit of the dead man and remember in this struggle that virtue was its own reward.

  "
283,,WHY WE OPPOSE,"
    
 During the past fifteen months, hardly a week has passed but these pages have contained some statement against the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, and yet there is no denying the fact that the majority of Europeans and even many Indians will not be able to say why there should be such bitter and sustained opposition to a mere registration law. Some say that the Act is objectionable because it requires Asiatics and their children over eight years to give digit impressions; others, again, because this law gives unlimited power to harass Asiatics. Whilst we do not minimise the importance of these objections, we do not hesitate to admit that, by themselves, they would be trivial, at any rate, certainly not worth the sacrifice that British Indians have pledged themselves to make.
 Why, then, this strenuous struggle? The answer is because the Act, read in conjunction with the events that preceded it and produced it, is one that takes away the very manhood from British Indians, who claim to be just as civilised as the law-givers themselves, in all the essentials of life. The Act constitutes, on the one hand, an assertion of a right on the part of the Government of the Transvaal to treat British Indians as they please, and without reference to the latter’s opinion or feelings. On the other, there is a denial of any such inherent right in the Government, especially when their act involves a curtailment of or an attack on personal liberty.
 If we were asked to point out in which Section of the Act is to be seen any such intention or assertion on the part of the Government, it would, perhaps, be difficult to lay our finger on any particular Section without exposing ourselves to the charge of sentimentality. Just as it is not possible to say in what particular grain of opium lies the poison, so, perhaps, is it not possible to point to the venom in the Act. But the whole of it is, undoubtedly, rank poison to a self-respecting Asiatic, and the trivialities mentioned above are, taken together,  sure indications of the fact. The general effect of the Act can only be felt but cannot be expressed; hence it is that the people at large have used symbols to represent the deadly spirit they have always sensed sub-consciously yet not the less really. What has happened during the attempted administration of the Act—the futile prosecution of Carim Jamal, the secret examination of applicants, the startling revelations at the trial of the Indian priestlibtech_442_footnotelibtech_443_footnote—furnishes a terrible confirmation and a
 
 complete justification of the view held by the Indian community.
 After what we have stated above, it is, perhaps, hardly necessary to show wherein lies the religious objection, but a little closer examination is possibly necessary, as even well-meaning friends have asked the question. Judging from the highest standpoint, we will not use the very effective argument drawn from the wantonly invidious distinction made between Turkish Mahomedans and other Turkish subjects, but for men of religion we would venture to put our argument in the form of a simple question: If it be a fact that Indians conscientiously consider that the Act unmans them, degrades them, practically enslaves them, can those who are less than men  ever worship God; can men who, well knowing the injurious consequences of a particular measure, accept it from base, because purely selfish and worldly, motives ever serve God?
 Viewed in this light, it is clear  that  the  struggle is  of  paramount importance. A handful of men, usually accounted as not particularly brave, are crossing swords with a comparatively mighty Government with unrestricted power. Can they succeed? We say, emphatically, “Yes” —provided that they are, as they have hitherto shown themselves to be, willing and ready to sacrifice commensurately with the result to be obtained.

 "
284,,WHY DO WE OPPOSE LAW?,"
    
 For the past twelve months, we have been writing something or other in this journal in reply to this question. In spite of that, the cause behind the struggle, we are afraid, has remained obscure to most Indians. We can hope that the game will start in right earnest now. We expect that, though the Government is afraid, it will surely lay hands on about a hundred Indians at least. If it does not, we shall be really sorry. Superficially, it may not appear proper to talk in this strain; yet, we think that what we have said is right. For, the time for our test has arrived. The people are in high spirits. If the Government denies us the opportunity of being tested, it will not come again. As warriors on the battle-field feel sorely disappointed when they return without fighting, so is the condition of the Transvaal Indians just now. Only if a hundred Indians, at least, went to gaol, could it be said that a fight was given. This journal will be in the hands of the Transvaal readers just on the 1st or 2nd of December. At that time, the brave will be eagerly waiting to be the first on the battle-field, that is, to be arrested without having committed any crime. The cowards, frightened to
 death, will be hiding in their houses, terrified at the thought of being arrested. And as for those who have blackened their faces, how can they have the good fortune of such an occasion of patriotic service? Whether cowards or heroes, for both we consider December 2 to be a grand occasion. We congratulate even the cowards because, though panicky, for the sake of the country they have not submitted to registration.
 Why do we write thus? What heavy task is the Indian community facing? Why are we opposing the law? Let us now  consider the answer. To many it appears that there is a fight because of the objection to giving ten finger-prints , to some, the only objectionable thing is submitting the names of mother and wife ; while others say that it is painful to think of the police making a house-to-house search. It is true that all these things are rather humiliating. Only thieves submit ten fingerprints; reference to the sacred name of the mother, by way of insult, has called forth daggers from waist-bands; when the police have asked for passes from people, presuming them to be suspects, they have had from the persons, enraged by the insult, a blow with the fist which sent them staggering to the ground. In spite of this, if someone asks for finger-prints courteously, and without compulsion, and we comply, no serious resentment is felt. It is with great joy that we take the name of the mother in the same manner as we utter the name of Ishwar or Khuda while saying prayers with the rosary. That is to say, the things referred to above are objectionable because they have been introduced with a view to insulting us. Not all yellow people suffer from jaundice. But, generally speaking, if we see an emaciated body which is yellow, we shall take it for granted that the person has got that disease. A physician will not treat the person for being yellow. He will treat him for jaundice.
 We have to spot out, then, the jaundice in the law. It is this: that the white people, by introducing this law, wish to show that the Asiatics are not men but beasts; not free men, but slaves; not their equals, but their inferiors; that they are born to endure whatever is inflicted on them, that they have no right to protest; that they are not men, but cowards. [Taking of] finger-prints, etc., is only a symptom of this condition, this jaundice. Whatever the law wants us to do, it wants us to do under compulsion. The Indian, who is a man of credit, is assumed to be a thief. Assuming that we are thieves, they also consider our children to be thieves, and strike fear in them by unworthy attacks on them. In our country the words, “A European is coming”, arouse terror in children from infancy. So here also this law is intended to terrorize them. If we were asked to point out in which section of the law all this occurs, it would be difficult to reply. No one can point to
 
 the flower of Deadly Nightshade and say which part of it contains the poison. The proof of the poison is in eating [its berries]; and the same is true of this law. If this law is read and fully understood by a proud and self-respecting man, it cannot but send a shudder through his body. It deprives the Indian of the very spirit of manliness in him. And just as a blunted sword becomes useless, so the Indian who submits to this law ceases to be a human being.
 After this, who will ask where the objection from the point of view of religion lies. Leaving aside the fact that in Turkey, it applies to the Muslims but that the Christians and the Jews are excluded, if this law exists to insult us and to treat us like animals, we want to know whether animals know God or understand religion.
 In fact, this law amounts to a war between the Asiatics and the white people. The latter declare: ‘We shall keep the Asiatics merely as machines to slave for us.’ The Indians opposing the law in the Transvaal say: ‘If we stay, we shall stay as free men and as equals in everyday affairs.’ That is the true significance of the law. To challenge a strong enemy to a struggle like this and to win is difficult as well as easy. It is difficult because we have to invite trouble; easy in the sense that the man feels happy in suffering loss while serving the community with a view to securing the welfare of the country.
 A match for the mighty in every respect, in wealth, physical strength and such are the white people; then, how will a handful of Indians prevail against them? To the man who asks such a question, we shall not hesitate to reply that he has little faith in God. How can we forget:
 He who is born must die; Yield not to despair;
 The Almighty is with you, The merciful God.
 Moreover, we are told what happens when a person, though strong, takes to oppression: “I am myself God,” so declared Mansur to the entire world. [But] he mounted the gallows—so full  of difficulties is this life.
 In this struggle, only one condition is required for our success, and that is that our courage must be real. Our sword, in the form of our capacity to suffer, must be made not of wood, but of tempered steel.

285,,OUR SUPPLEMENT,"
    
 The question of a delegation to the [Indian National] Congress came up only because Mr. Ameeroodeen Fajandar happened to be going to India. He has from the first shown unflinching opposition to the law. Therefore, when he was to go to India, several of his friends asked him whether he would like to go as a delegate. Mr. Ameero- odeen instantly took up the challenge. That would be the first thing he would attend to in India; that was the assurance he  gave  before leaving. We publish that gentleman’s photograph in this issue.
 Mr. Ameeroodeen is 36 years old. His parents belonged to a family of Zamindars, which is the reason why his surname is Fajandar. He belongs to the famous Zatam family. When he first came to the Transvaal in the year 1888, he joined the well-known firm of Sheth Mahomed Cassim Camroodeen as a clerk. He served there till 1893, when he started his own business. The name of his firm is Messrs Mahomed Hussain & Co. Many whites tried to get him to apply for registration by threatening to withhold credit, but he stuck to his resolution.

286,"May 	31, 1902",OBNOXIOUS LAW AND REGULATIONS MADE UNDER IT,"
    
 We give in this issue the English text of the new law and the regulations made under it, and a Gujarati translation of the same. We also gave a Gujarati translation earlier.libtech_444_footnoteThere are some changes in the translation that is being given herewith. We also give the relevant sections of the Peace Preservation Ordinance. Apart from this, there are also other important items in this issue. We therefore advise every Indian to read this issue carefully and then preserve it. Since we know that the new law and the regulations made under it provide the most effective arguments against themselves, we intend to publish the law and the regulations in the form of a booklet, both in English and Gujarati. It will be priced at 6d. We are convinced that this issue. and the booklet on the law deserve to find a place in every home in India.
 l.	Law No. 3 of 1885 will remain in force with the modifications that follow.
 
 
  The 	term “Asiatics” 	will mean 	Indians, coolies and 	Muslim subjects 	of Turkey. 	It will 	not include 	Malays and 	the Chinese who 	had come in 	as indentured labourers. 	(There are 	other definitions 	of Registrar, etc., which are not given here.)  Every 	Asiatic lawfully 	residing in the 	Transvaal must 	register himself. There 	will be no fee for such registration. 
 Asiatics of the following description will be deemed lawful residents of the Transvaal:
  Any 	Asiatic who 	holds a 	permit under the 	Permit Act, 	unless such 	permit was 	fraudulently obtained. 	(Temporary permits are 	not covered 	by this).  Any 	Asiatic resident and 	actually in 	the Transvaal 	on May 	31, 1902. Any 	Asiatic born in 	the Transvaal 	after May 31, 1902. 
  Every 	Asiatic resident in the 	Transvaal at 	the date of 	the taking 	effect of this 	Act shall 	apply for registration 	to such 	officer, at 	such place and 	before such 	date as may 	be prescribed 	by the 	Colonial Secretary. 	Every Asiatic who enters 	the Transvaal 	after the 	date of the 	taking effect 	of this 	Act and who 	has not previously been 	registered thereunder 	shall  apply 	 for registration 	within eight days of his entry. 
  It 	is not necessary 	to make 	an application 	under this clause for a 	child under the 	age of eight years.  For 	the registration of 	a child 	above eight 	years and 	under sixteen 	years, the application 	shall be made 	by his 	guardian and 	if not 	so made 	shall be 	made by 	such child 	within one month 	after attaining the 	age of 16 years. 
  The 	Registrar shall consider 	the applications 	of Asiatics 	who are 	lawful residents, and 	register every such 	applicant whose 	application may 	be approved 	by him. 
 If the Registrar rejects the application of any Asiatic, he will give to the person concerned at least 14 days’ notice to appear before a magistrate. If he fails to appear at the time specified or, having appeared, fails to satisfy the magistrate as to his right to remain in the Transvaal, the magistrate shall order such Asiatic to leave the Transvaal if he is above 16 years of age, and sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Peace Preservation Ordinance, 1903 shall apply to such order.
  Any 	Asiatic who 	is the 	guardian of 	a child 	under eight shall upon 	making application 	for registration 	on his 	own behalf supply to the Registrar such particulars and furnish such means 
 of identification in respect of the child as may be prescribed by regulation. If the applicant is himself registered, such particulars shall be noted on the register. Within one year of the child attaining the age of eight, the guardian concerned shall make application for registration on behalf of the child at the office of the Resident Magistrate of the district in which he resides.
 An Asiatic who is the guardian of a child born in the Transvaal shall apply for registration on behalf of the child within one year of the child reaching the age of eight.
  If 	the guardian 	does not 	apply as 	required above, he 	shall if 	required by 	the Registrar 	or the 	Resident Magistrate make 	such application 	at any later date.  If 	the guardian 	does not apply, 	or if the 	application made 	by the 	guardian is rejected, 	the application for 	registration shall 	 be made by 	the child 	within one month 	after reaching the age 	of sixteen. 	The Resident 	Magistrate at whose office such application 	is made 	shall cause the 	application along 	with the relevant 	documents to be 	forwarded to 	the Registrar 	who shall 	if satisfied 	that the same is in order 	issue a certificate of  	registration. 
  When 	the guardian has 	not, as required above, 	furnished the 	particulars of 	a child 	under the age of 	eight years and 	has not made 	application for 	registration on 	behalf of 	the child after he 	attained the 	age of eight 	years, the application 	shall be made 	by the 	child within one 	month after he 	attains the 	age of 16; 	and the 	Registrar may issue 	a certificate of 	registration at 	his discretion.  Any 	person who 	shall fail to 	make application for 	registration as 	required by this 	Act shall be 	liable to 	a fine 	not exceeding £100 	and in 	default of 	payment to 	imprisonment with 	or without 	hard labour 	for a 	period not 	exceeding three months. 
 Any person who brings into the Transvaal an Asiatic under the age of sixteen years not lawfully resident in the Transvaal, and any person who shall employ such child, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to penalties mentioned above and to cancellation of the certificate of registration, in addition to which he will be ordered to leave the Transvaal. If he does not leave the Transvaal, he will be liable to a fine or to imprisonment as provided for in the law, sections 6, 7 and 3 of the Peace Preservation Ordinance being applicable  to  such  order.
 Any Asiatic over the age of sixteen years who is found in the Transvaal without a registration certificate after such date as may be notified by the Colonial Secretary will be ordered to leavethe Transvaal, and if he does not leave the Transvaal shall be liable to a fine or to imprisonment.
 If an Asiatic who has failed, to make application for regis- tration shall satisfy the Magistrate that such failure was due to some good and sufficient cause, the Magistrate may give him time to ma-ke such application. If the person fails to obtain registration within the appointed time, he shall again be ordered to leave the Transvaal, and if he fails to do so, he shall be liable to the usual penalties.
  Any 	member of 	the police 	force or 	any other person 	authorized thereto 	by the 	Colonial Secretary may 	require an 	Asiatic of 	the age 	of sixteen 	or over 	to produce 	his certificate 	of registration 	and supply such 	particulars and 	furnish such means 	of identification 	as may 	be prescribed 	by Regulation. 
 With regard to an Asiatic under the age of 16 years, the guardian of such child shall produce the certificate of registration and supply the particulars and furnish the means of identification required by this Act.
  Any 	person holding a 	new certificate 	of registration 	issued to 	him under this Act shall 	be entitled 	to enter 	and to reside 	in the 	Transvaal, provided he 	has not been ordered 	[to leave 	the Colony] under 	section 10 of the 	Peace Preservation Ordinance.  Any 	person into whose 	hands shall 	come any 	certificate of 	registration or 	temporary permit 	of which 	he is not 	the lawful holder 	shall transmit the 	document immediately to 	the Registrar. 	If he fails 	to do so, 	he will 	be liable 	to a 	fine not exceeding 	£50 or 	to imprisonment with 	or without 	hard labour 	for a 	period not 	exceeding one month.  Any 	person who 	loses his certificate of 	registration shall 	apply to 	the Registrar to 	have it 	renewed. The 	application shall 	contain such particulars 	as may 	be required 	under the rules, 	and it 	must have 	a stamp 	of 5s affixed 	to it.  After 	a date 	to be notified 	in the 	Gazette, no 	Asiatic shall obtain 	a trading 	licence under 	the Revenue Licences 	Ordinance or under 	any bye-law 	in force 	in a 	municipality unless 	he shall produce his certificate of 	registration and 	supply such particulars 	and furnish 	such means of 	identification as 	may be 	prescribed by Regulation. Whenever the age of any Asiatic is in question, such Asiatic shall 
 unless and until the contrary be proved be taken to be of the age which the Registrar shall certify to be in  his  opinion  the apparent age of such Asiatic.
  Any 	affidavit that 	may have to be made 	under this Act shall be exempt from 	stamp duty.  Any 	person, who 	commits any 	fraudulent act 	in connection 	with an 	application for 	registration or 	for the purpose 	of obtaining 	a certificate 	of registration 	or makes 	a false 	statement, or incites 	or aids 	any person in 	such act 	or statement, 	or forges any certificate 	of registration, 	or uses 	as his certificate 	any certificate 	of registration of 	which he is not 	the lawful  holder 	 or  any 	forged certificate, or 	causes such certificate 	to be used 	by others, 	shall be 	liable to 	a fine 	not exceeding £500 	or to imprisonment 	with or without hard labour for a term not exceeding two years.  The 	Colonial Secretary may 	in his 	absolute discretion 	issue to 	any Asiatic 	a permit 	for a 	limited period 	only and after 	the expiry 	of such 	period such 	person shall 	be deemed to 	be a person not 	duly authorized 	to be in this 	Colony and 	if found may be arrested 	without warrant and the 	provisions of 	sections 7, 	8 and 	9 of 	the Peace 	Preservation Ordinance shall apply to 	such person 	who shall 	be liable 	to the 	penalties provided 	therein as if 	he were 	a person 	who had been 	ordered to 	leave the 	Colony under 	the said Ordinance. 	Temporary permits issued before the 	date of the 	taking effect of 	this Act shall 	also be 	governed by 	this Act. Any 	person who 	holds a 	temporary permit 	may be 	exempted from 	the restrictions on 	the use of 	 liquor.  The 	Colonial Secretary may 	also grant such 	exemption to 	an Asiatic who 	is not subject to the provisions of this Act.  The 	Governor may from 	time to time make 	or repeal Regulations 	for any of 	the following purposes:   Prescribing 		the form 		of the 		register to 		be kept under this 		Act;  Prescribing 		the manner 		and form in 		which application 		shall be made 		for registration, 		the particulars to 		be supplied and the means of identification to be furnished; Prescribing 		the form 		of certificates 		of registration;  Prescribing 		the particulars 		and the means 		of identifica- 		tion marks to 		be furnished by 		the guardian 		of a 		child under 		the age of eight 		years by any 		Asiatic who 		may be required 		to produce 		his certificate 		of registration 		under section 9, 		by any Asiatic 		applying for the 		renewal of 		any certificate of registration which has been lost or destro-  
 yed and by any Asiatic applying for a trading licence;
   Prescribing 		the form 		of permit to 		be issued under section 		17 of the Act.   Any 	Asiatic or 	guardian of 	an Asiatic failing to 	comply with any 	requirement of this Act 	shall, except where otherwise specified, be liable 	to a fine 	not exceeding 	£100 or to imprisonment 	with or 	without hard 	labour for 	a period 	not exceeding 	three months.  The 	Labour Importation 	Ordinance relating to 	the Chinese 	shall not 	apply to Asiatics.  If 	an Asiatic has 	acquired any land 	in his name 	 before  the 	taking effect of 	the Act of 	1885, his 	heir and 	successor will be 	entitled to 	that land.  This 	Act shall not 	come into force till 	such time as the 	Emperor is 	pleased to 	give his 	assent thereto and 	his assent is 	notified in 	the Gazette. 
 SOME SECTIONS OF PEACE PRESERVATION ORDINANCE OF 1903 REFERRED TO IN NEW LAW:
  Every 	person so 	arrested shall 	with all convenient 	speed be 	brought before 	a magistrate and 	if he fails to satisfy 	the magistrate that 	he is duly 	authorized to 	enter or 	reside in 	this Colony 	under the provisions 	of this 	Ordinance, the 	magistrate may 	make an order 	in writing, 	directing such 	person to 	leave this 	Colony within such 	time as may 	be specified 	in such 	order, provided 	that if 	such person 	declares upon 	oath that 	he has already obtained 	a permit 	and gives satisfactory 	reasons for his 	inability to 	produce the 	same or if he declares 	upon oath that he 	can produce 	satisfactory evidence that 	he belongs 	to one 	of the 	classes exempted from 	the necessity of 	obtaining a 	permit by 	the provisions 	of Section 	2 hereof, 	he may 	be released 	upon entering 	into a 	recognizance with 	or without 	sureties to produce 	before any 	magistrate named 	in such 	recognizance and 	within the 	time stated therein such 	permit or 	evidence, as 	the case may 	be. If 	such person 	fails to 	comply with 	the conditions 	of his 	recognizance, it 	shall be forfeited.  Any 	person who 	may be ordered 	to leave 	this Colony and fails 	to do so within 	the time 	specified in 	the order 	and any person 	whose recognizance 	has been 	forfeited under 	the provisions 	of the 	last preceding Section 	may be 	arrested without warrant 	and brought before 	a magistrate and 	shall upon 	conviction be 	sentenced to imprisonment with or without hard labour for a 
 period of not less than one month and not more than six months and with or without a fine not exceeding £500 and in default of payment to a further term of imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months.
  If 	any person 	imprisoned under 	the terms 	of the 	last preceding 	Section shall remain in 	the Colony 	for a 	period of 	more than 	seven days after the 	expiry of 	his term 	of imprisonment 	[without obtaining permission in writing from the Colonial Secretary]libtech_445_footnotelibtech_446_footnote, he 	may be 	arrested without 	a warrant and brought 	before a 	magistrate and 	shall on 	conviction be 	sentenced to 	imprison- ment 	with or without 	hard labour for a 	period of 	not less 	than six 	and not more than twelve 	months and with or 	without a 	fine not 	exceeding £500 	and in default 	of payment 	to a 	further term 	of imprisonment 	for a 	period not 	exceeding six months. Any 	person who   obtains 		or attempts 		to obtain 		or incites 		any person 		to obtain 		or aids 		or abets 		any person 		in obtaining 		a permit 		by any 		fraud, 		misrepresentation, false pretence, falsehood or 		other improper means;  uses 		or attempts 		to use 		or incites 		any person 		to use 		or aids 		or abets any person in using any permit so obtained;  enters 		or attempts 		to enter this 		Colony on a 		permit so 		obtained or 		on a 		permit not issued 		to him by 		proper authority

 "
287,"December 3, 1907",LETTER TO PRIVATE SECRETARY TO HIGH COMMISSIONER,"
  
 21-24 COURT CHAMBERS, CORNER RISSIK & ANDERSON STREETS,
 P. O. BOX 6522, JOHANNESBURG, December 3, 1907
THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO
 HIS EXCELLENCY THE HIGH COMMISSIONER JOHANNESBURG
SIR,
 Mr. David Pollock has just brought me a message from Mr. Hosken suggesting to me that I should approach His Excellency priv- ately in connection with the serious situation that has arisen regarding the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, and to place before His Excellency what I consider would be acceptable to the Asiatic communities and would, at the same time, meet the main object of the Government.
 I need hardly preface what I am about to say with the statement that, in the position I have felt called upon to take up in this matter, my desire has been to serve the Government equally with my countrymen. It is because I consider myself to be a lover of the Empire for what I have learned to be its beauties that, seeing, rightly or wrongly, in the Asiatic Law Amendment Act seeds of danger to it, I have advised my countrymen at all costs to resist the Act in the most peaceful and, shall I add, Christian manner.
 The object of the Government being to identify every Indian entitled to remain in and enter the Colony, in my humble opinion, it can be met by amending the Immigration Restriction Act, which still awaits the Royal sanction, and which, I trust, will not receive the Royal sanction in its present form. In my humble opinion, the offer for voluntary registration will not, in view of the prospective repeal of the Peace    Preservation   Ordinance,   be    of    much    use,    because any
 
“Obnoxious Law”, 6-7-1907 and Appendix IV.
 registration certificates that might be taken out would be of no avail without the Peace Preservation Ordinance. I, therefore, venture to suggest as follows:
 to 	withdraw the notices in the Government Gazette 
regarding registration under the Act;
  to 	amend the 	Immigration Restriction 	Act at 	the next 	session of 	Parliament so 	as to provide for 	the issue of 	certificates of 	domicile to 	those Indians who 	may be entitled 	to remain 	in orenter 	the Colony 	the Peace 	by Preservation 	Ordinance, and those who 	may hold £3 	registration 	certificates under Law 3 	of 1885, 	who can establish their 	claim to the  	certificates.  Certificates of 	domicile will 	take the place of 	registration certificates, 	and will contain 	full identification 	particulars. This does 	not contemplate certificates 	for the 	minor children 	of domiciled 	Asiatics, but, in 	order to 	prevent any 	fraud, children, 	with their names and 	ages, will be 	described in 	certificates of 	domicile; so 	that, at 	the utmost, 	what may happen 	can never be 	an unlawful 	increase in the 	number of 	Asiatic children in 	the Colony, 	but, possibly, in the 	rarest cases, 	personation, which can 	be dealt 	with stringently 	under the Immigration 	Restriction Act. The 	amendment does 	also not 	contemplate certificates 	of domicile for 	Asiatics who 	will be 	able to 	pass the 	education test, 	which, under the 	clause as 	it at present stands, 	is sufficiently heavy 	and, therefore, 	provides complete identification by 	itself. The 	amendment will also repeal the Asiatic Act. 
 Seeing that fifteen months have passed by without any registration, perhaps three or four more would not matter; but, if the Government think otherwise, it is respectfully submitted that they may, after the withdrawal of the notices, issue registration certificates in place of the existing documents, if only in order to test the bona fides of the community. These may, at the time of amending the Immigration Act, be recognised as certificates of domicile.
 In my opinion, the chief reason for passing the Asiatic Act was the charge of surreptitious entry  on a wholesale basislibtech_448_footnotelibtech_449_footnote.  I have always felt most strongly about it, as I have always known intimately the working of the Asiatic Department under successive officers. The evidence that led Captain Hamilton Fowle to suppose that there was little surreptitious entry was the evidence that was used by Mr. Chamney to report unfavourably. I still believe that Mr. Chamney is entirely incompetent for the office he holds, in having no legal ability
 
 
 to sift evidence. I have nothing against him personally. He is affable and above suspicion, but these two qualities do not make up for the want of a further qualification which is indispensable to an office such as he holds. I, therefore, as an alternative to the exchange of existing certificates, venture to suggest the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court, the Chief Magistrate for the Witwatersrand District, or some such high official with legal knowledge to investigate the charge of surreptitious entry. He will be able to report upon anything that the Asiatic Officers may have to place before him; and, if the inquiry made is open to the public, and witnesses are publicly examined, it will allay the anxiety of the people of the Transvaal, and any report that might be made could not bequestioned by any people and would, perhaps, pave the way for the amendment suggested in this letter.
 I purposely refrain from examining the methods  of identification and considering the question of finger-prints, which is only a secondary matter. If the idea of repealing the Asiatic Act and seeking the co-operation of the Indian community be entertained, other difficulties can, I have no doubt, be overcome.
 If required, I shall be prepared to submit in legal phraseology amendments to the Immigration Restriction Act that would, in my humble opinion, completely fulfil the object of the Asiatic Act so far as identification is concerned, without in any way wounding the susceptibilities of British Indians.
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servant,
 M. K. GANDHI

 The exception made in favour of Asiatic members of the professions is taken by the community rather in the nature of an insult than anything else. Incidentally, my Association draws your attention to the fact that, whilst members of any of the liberal professions may use first class cabs, their wives and children evidently may not.
 My Association ventures to trust that the Government will be pleased, in justice to the community represented by my Association, to reject the amendment.

       [JOHANNESBURG,  Before 	December 7, 1907]  [THE 	HIGH 	COMMISSIONER 	PRETORIA SIR,]  	At the request of the Punjabis, Pathans and Sikhs, being British 	subjects resident in the Transvaal, I have the honour to enclose 	here with for His Excellency’s consideration a memoriallibtech_453_footnotelibtech_454_footnotesigned 	by Jama- dar Nawab Khan and Fazali Ilahi on behalf of the others 	whom they represent, and whose names are given in the list attached 	to the memorial  	In forwarding the petition, I am aware of the fact that His Excel- 	lency’s intervention can, if at all, only with difficulty be 	enlisted, but I need hardly point out how serious the situation is 	so far as regards the memorialists, who are old soldiers and who 	have fought, as they are undoubtedly now ready to do, for and under 	the British banner. Whether protection is afforded to them by the 	local Govern-ment or the Imperial Government, in my humble opinion, 	it is neces-sary that some steps should be taken to allay the 	grievances under which they are labouring.     
 It was with great hesitation that I undertook to draft the petition for them, but I felt that, as a lover of the Empire to which I belong, I owed it as a duty to give suitable expression to their feelings. Some of them were, and still are, anxious to lay their grievances personally before the highest representative of their Sovereign in South Africa. I have, however, pointed out to them that such a request was hardly likely to be acceded to, owing not only to the pressure of work that is entailed upon His Excellency but also, perhaps, to the impropriety of any such request by the memorialists.
     Indian 	Opinion, 7-12-1907  [I 	have, etc.,  M. K. GANDHI] "
291,,RITCH’S SERVICES,"
       	Not all Indians, perhaps, have a full idea of the tireless pains 	taken by Mr. Ritch in England for their benefit. Recently, he has 	placed the Indians under a further obligation by publishing a brief 	pamphletlibtech_455_footnotewhich 	gives a vivid account of the hardships of Indians in the Transvaal. 	Every Indian knows that Mr. Ritch’s services are invaluable. He 	has compressed the whole account into a pamphlet of twenty-three 	pages(octavo size); it is a succinct statement, covering the whole 	ground and giving the history as from 1885. It is not only through 	the efforts of Mr. Ritch that we stand to gain; his position also 	counts. That is to say, a veteran white colonist of eighteen years 	standing like Mr. Ritch taking up the struggle on behalf of the 	rights of Indians can have a more powerful effect on the white 	people. It is for this reason that he has referred to this fact in 	the preface to his pamphlet. The vast amount of information which he 	has compressed into such a small pamphlet shows the anxious labour 	bestowed on his work by Mr. Ritch.  	Mr. Ritch has done the right thing in recalling the promises given 	to the Indian community by Lord Milner in the year 1903. Lord Milner 	had said then:  Once 	on the 	register, their 	position is 	established and 	no further 	registration is 	necessary, nor 	is a fresh 	permit required. That registration gives you 	a right 	to be here, and a right 	to come and go.libtech_456_footnote  	Mr. Ritch has compared compulsory and voluntary registration in 	order to point out the difference between the two. Voluntary regist-     
 ration would be devoid of the sting of compulsion, and would consti- tute an act of grace performed by the Asiatic community in deference to white sentiment. If registration is made compulsory, there will be no difference between Indians and Kaffirs, and the neighbouring Colony will be tempted to adopt it as a precedent. It may also turn out to be a prelude to compulsory segregation in Coloured Locations.
 Mr. Ritch has not endeavoured to argue the question, but has relied upon facts, which he has marshalled so as to lead the reader to the irresistible conclusion that the Indian case is just. As has been pointed out by Mr. Ritch at the end of the pamphlet, the inconsistency between prewar promises and post-war performance exposes the Government’s perfidy. In Mr. Ritch’s own words:libtech_457_footnote
 Apart from the duty, of the Transvaal Government to protect the interests of a wholly unrepresented minority, there is the obligation of the Transvaal to subordinate merely local interests to the welfare of the Empire at large. Let the whites only consider to what extent the authority and prestige of the Imperial Government have been endangered by their heaping of indignity upon indignity upon representatives of the three hundred millions of Indians for the sake of a quarter of a million whites.
 Mr. Ritch’s pamphlet will enable the whites in England and else- where to consider the Indian point of view on the Transvaal question. That will be a very important gain for the Indian community.
 We are thus putting up a strong fight, and it seems that even negotiations for a compromise have started; in view of this, it should hardly be necessary for us to add that we expect every Indian to remain firm and, guarding himself against any trap that the Govern- ment may lay, boldly to hold himself ready for imprisonment.

292,,WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THOSE WHO SUBMIT TO LAW?,"
  
 This question has often been answered by us. Now Mr. Hill has answered it. Mr. Hill is one of the leading figures among those opposed to the Asiatics. We give elsewhere the summarylibtech_458_footnoteof a letter written by him. Everyone ought to read it. Mr. Hill remarks that the new law is only a beginning; in the end, the Asiatics are to be driven out altogether. Other laws will certainly follow. Hence, the challenge
 
 of the Indian struggle against the new law must be met squarely by the Government. In other words, the law should be enforced in its entirety and the Asiatics should be crushed. After that is done, the whites will be able to do whatever they want. Is there anyone who will believe, in the face of such a letter, that he can live in peace after submitting to the new law?

 "
293,,RAM SUNDAR PUNDIT,"
  
 We have received letters asking some questions about Punditji. We do not intend to publish them, for the people who wrote them have been altogether misinformed. One of the questions raised in the letters will be answered here. Someone wants to know how the community can gain anything by Punditji’s staying on here after the expiry of his temporary permit and being imprisoned for that. It is quite wrong to raise such a doubt. All persons holding temporary permits are not in a position to fight as Punditji did. Such persons are bound to leave the Transvaal on the expiry of the period but those working as priests are in a position to stay on even if an extension is not granted to them. That is the reason why he stayed on, as desired by the community. The [Indian] residents of Germiston had written [to the authorities] on this subject. And in the trial which took place, he was charged under section 17 of the new Act. We are convinced that the case against him has done much good to the community. Everyone feels bolder as a result of Punditji’s going to gaol. At a time like this, nothing but good can be done by any Indian going to gaol in the course of the struggle against the law. For, this is our first experience. The imprisonment of a man like Punditji is bound to have a very powerful effect; in fact, there has been such an effect. It is because of that effect that Shahji Saheb and others did their utmost to follow him to gaol, and that a meeting was held in Germiston attended by hundreds of  Indians, where Punditji was complimented on his courage. Everyone can talk, but, so far, only Punditji has shown himself capable of action. It is enough for us that he has sacrificed himself for the benefit of the community, and is prepared to make still further sacrifices  after coming out of gaol.

294,,VOLUNTEERS FOR NATAL,"
  
 There is again a rebellion of Kaffirs in Zululand. In view of this, hundreds of white troops have been dispatched. The Indian commu- nity must come forward at such a time without, however, thinking of securing any rights thereby. They must consider only the duty of the community. It is a common observation that when we attend to our duty, rights follow as a matter of course. It will be only proper for the Indian community to make the offer that was made last year.libtech_459_footnoteThere is a move at present to levy a tax on those who do not enlist. The burden of this levy will fall on Indians alone; even though paying the tax, they will get no credit. We are, therefore, convinced in our minds that the Indian community should repeat its offer. We assume that there are many Indians now who will welcome such work enthusiastically. Those who went to the front last year can do so again. Most of them are seasoned people and familiar with the nature of the work. We very much hope that this work will be taken in hand without any delay.

 HUGE MASS MEETING
 There is no end to mass meetings of Indians. And each such meeting is better than the preceding one. The last meeting held in Pretoria was much larger than the one held earlier. The meeting held on Sunday last at Johannesburglibtech_460_footnotesurpassed even the one at Pretoria, so impressive were the spirit of the people and the size of the crowd. Nowadays people attend the meetings on their own and everyone is filled with enthusiasm. Everywhere there is evidence of a burning desire for patriotic service at any cost.
 MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND
 This meeting was attended by more than 2,000 people. There were delegates from many places. There were nearly 40 from Pretoria, 16 from Potchefstroom, and so on from every place.
 
 MEETING IN SURATI MOSQUE
 The meeting was held in the compound of the Surati mosque. There were men sitting everywhere, on the verandah of the mosque, its terrace and roof. Originally, it was intended to hold the meeting in Mr. Essop Mia’s new house. But quite a large number of men had collected there even before the meeting commenced, and since it was impossible to accommodate all of them in that building, it was decided on the spot to hold the meeting in the open.
 ESSOP MIA
 Mr. Essop Mia took the chair, though, in view of the situation obtaining then, he and most others from Johannesburg kept standing all the time. He welcomed the delegates who had assembled, and thanked the pickets for their work.
 SUBSTANCE OF OTHER SPEECHES
 Mr. Gandhi explained what was likely to happen in December, and referred to the growing feeling of sympathy on the part of the whites. This was the time for Indians to win their freedom and they were not, therefore, to keep on looking to the leaders all the time. Everyone was to look upon himself as a leader and boldly face imprisonment or any other hardship that might be inflicted on him. Our petition no longer lay with an earthly ruler; it was to be addressed to the Creator.
 Mr. Emam Abdool Cadir showed that those who had faith in God had no cause for fear. He was a picket, and he would be glad if the Government laid hands on him first.
 Mr. Manibhai Desai (from Pretoria) said that if the Government came down on the pickets first, he would be very happy to bear the brunt of the attack.
 One Kanmia picket, whose name I do not know, said that he would not be in the least afraid.
 Mr. Abdool Gani said that in this struggle God was on their side, since their cause was just. They were not in the least afraid of going to gaol.
Mr. Naidoo spoke in Tamil and explained the position.
 Mr. Shahji Saheb, after referring to what Hazrat Imam Hussein had suffered, said that what had happened to Ram Sundar Pundit might also happen to a Muslim priest. Unable to bear this thought, he had forced himself to be prepared to follow the Pundit to gaol.
Mr. Omarji Sale said that he would have no fear of gaol.
Mr. Coovadia said that it would not matter if the Government
 attacked businessmen and forced them to close down the shops. That would bring our freedom very near.
 Mr. Khurshedji Desai (from Krugersdorp) described the difficulties of the Kaffirs in obtaining the passes which they were required to carry.
 Mr. Abdul Rahman (from Potchefstroom) said that Potchefstroom was quite strong and that all people there  were prepared to go to gaol.
 Mr. Osman Latief (from Potchefstroom) said that he was prepared to go to gaol, leaving his wife and children behind.
 Mr. Quinn (President of the Chinese Association) spoke in English and said that this was a struggle to secure the freedom of Asiatics. All the Chinese were ready to fight unto death.
 Mr. Ebrahim Aswat said that if the Indian community yielded now and took out registers through fear, it would be called to account before God by the Chinaman who had committed suicide, for it was the Indians who had exhorted the Chinese to fight.
 Mr. Nawab Khan said that it was the duty of every Indian to fight to the last for the benefit of the community and for the sake of religion.
 Mr. Hajee Habib, in his speech, expressed regret that Memons had taken out registers, and advised them to remain firm.
 Mr. Polak said that it was only now that the time of real test had drawn near. After Mr. Gandhi’s imprisonment, he would not spare himself in carrying out whatever fell to his lot.
 In reply to some questions, Mr. Gandhi said that if, after being arrested, anyone was required in gaol to give digit-impressions, he should give them. This was a struggle for freedom from slavery, not against digit-impressions. In gaol, the rule for taking ten finger-prints applied to everyone. They need not oppose it. If, however, anyone asked them in gaol to get themselves registered, that must not be done. In case he himself was arrested, Mr. Polak would be able to attend to all work, such as sending telegrams, etc. No one was to engage a lawyer when arrested for not taking out a new register.
 Mr. Manji Lakhani (from Pretoria) said that some played “Codys”, and some smoked “Chamneys”.libtech_461_footnoteSpeaking for himself, he said he would rather become a beggar than take out the new register.
Mr. Cachalia said that, irrespective of whether the leaders
 
 remained firm or not, those who did not want slavery would continue to fight. The editor of The Transvaal Leader, Mr. Cartwright, having heard of the meeting, went there specially as an observer. He had much sympathy for the Indians. He is an eminent man and  has  himself been to gaol for his powerful writings. He is a very capable man, who is not afraid of defending truth.
 MESSAGE FROM RAM SUNDAR PUNDIT
 On Monday, Mr. Gandhi had an interview with Ram Sundar Pundit, having obtained special permission for it. Since the Governor had ordered that they should talk in English, the whole interview took place in English in the presence of the Chief Warder. Punditji spoke of many things, of which I reproduce here only the essential part:
 Please tell everyone that I am happy here. It would have been better if the Government had awarded me hard labour. After my release, I shall be prepared to go to gaol again for the sake of the community. While here, I have read all the poems on gaol-going. I have been deeply moved by them, especially by the poems of Mr. Mehtab. When I come out, I hope to see a copy of these poems in the hands of every Indian in Germiston. How is it that other Indians have not been arrested, though it is already December? We shall gain freedom only when that happens. Please tell everyone that there is no hardship in gaol. I see even women here. No one should feel anxious on my account. I feel as if I am in a palace. I only wish that no Indian submits to the law. The Governor and the Chief Warder look after me very well.
 I have felt much hesitation in reproducing what Punditji said about the poems on gaol-going. But I have given the message as a matter of duty because he was very particular about it. No one, however, should imagine that any monetary interest of those working with Indian Opinion is involved in this. The paper is brought out with great difficulty, and even now those who are working on it do not make any profit worth the name.
 PETITION BY PUNJABIS
 Last week I gave a translation of the petition made by the Punjabis.  Mr.  Gandhi  has  addressed  the  following  letterlibtech_462_footnoteto   Lord Selborne to accompany the petition.
 
 BLACKLEGS IN NOVEMBER
 Daring the month of November, pickets worked at Pretoria as well as they had done at Johannesburg. Thanks to their alertness, very few Indians got themselves registered, and not a single one, it can be claimed, from Pretoria itself. But there were a few here and there in the Colony. Heidelberg gave the lead. Mr. Ratilal, who is counted among the educated people, was the first. He was followed by some of Mr. Abu Mian Camroodeen’s men, and last came Mr. Khota’s men. Everyone felt sorry that Mr. Khota’s men had applied. The Surati community feels humiliated by the action of these men. The Gujarati Hindus are very much upset on account of Mr. Ratilal’s application. It was observed that the Gujarati Hindus had so far remained clean. Mr. Ratilal has disproved the general belief that, apart from Mr. Lakshmi Chand, no one else would apply. As regards the servants of Mr. Khota, he writes to say that it was not their fault. It was because of his pressure on them that they went. They were quite disinclined to go, but went because of his pressure. Mr. Khota is now sorry and feels ashamed. He adds that he was very much afraid, for he owned four shops. As for himself, he would not now apply under any circumstances, but would rather go to gaol. Since Mr. Khota does not defend his conduct, there is no more comment to be made. But it should be a matter of regret to everyone that he was overcome by fear. It would have been a fine thing if he had not faltered. I very much hope that no one will follow Mr. Khota’s example.
 Other blacklegs include some poor men from Madras and Calcutta. No weight is to be attached to them because they are quite unknown here and have been living almost as slaves. The argument that some leaders wanted registration to continue in November is thus proved to be baseless.
 “THE SUNDAY TIMES”
 The Sunday Times has remarked that, if the former permit officers had not proved corrupt, there could have been no need for the new law. It is thus proved that the Government is punishing the Indian community for the fault of its own officers.
 OTHER NEWSPAPERS
 The comments appearing in other newspapers are amusing. No- ne of them considers it likely that the Government could send anybo- dy to gaol. The Star even goes to the extent of saying that there sho- uld be no need to send anyone to gaol. By merely withholding licen- ces, they could apply a gradually increasing pressure and compel the people to take out registers. It openly says that, when any Indian is
 produced before a magistrate, the latter, instead of sending the Indian to gaol, should merely give him further time to apply for a register.
 BE ON GUARD
 The statement in The Star appears to be inspired by the Government and hence every Indian should be on his guard. If any Indian produced before a magistrate proves to be a coward, the result will be anything but good. The magistrate, instead of giving notice to such an Indian to leave the country, will only advise him to apply for  a register. If the Government thus wants to lay a trap, it is necessary for the Indians to be watchful. A plain refusal will solve all difficulties. Everyone should utter only an emphatic ‘no’ in reply. There is no limit now to the weakness of the Government. It is frightened of the very fact of its being tyrannical. Where is the threat of General Smuts? What has happened to his talk of deportation? Though the Government is betraying so much weakness, there are Indians who continue to harbour fear in their hearts.
 ANOTHER WARNING
 If anyone should present himself at the house of an Indian as a detective in plain clothes, and ask for his permit or want the shop to be closed down, no one should listen to him. It is  likely  that  some persons may go about posing as detectives.
 MOVE FOR COMPROMISE
 Many eminent whites have started a move for a compromise. Meetings have been taking place between Sir Percy Fitzpatrick and others. The indications at present are that the Government will not arrest anyone and that a compromise will be reached peacefully. If that happens, the credit for it will go to Ram Sundar Pundit and to the Chinaman who committed suicide. That incident produced a feeling of revulsion everywhere and strengthened the case of the Asiatics. The time has not yet come to make public all the facts about the move that has been initiated; hence I feel obliged to stop here. All newspapers now report that the Government will not enforce the present Act. Something will be done in January. The Government is thus climbing down step by step. No one, either black or white, even mentions now that all people can be sent to gaol.
 WELL DESERVED!
 Some people from Calcutta and Madras, who got themselves registered under threats or for fear of losing their jobs, have  now  lost their jobs. The reason for this is not known. But it is worth noting that, though they were inoculated against the plague, they could not
 save themselves. They are now very sorry. They have lost their jobs as well astheir honour. Another instance has also come to my knowledge. One or two Indians got themselves registered in the hope of being able to obtain credit. Now they have handed over their books of account to the dealers [who gave them credit] ! No one can fathom the ways of God.
 KONKANI PASSIVE RESISTER
 A Konkani named Mahomed Essak holds an old register and permit. In spite of this, he was arrested under the new law while on his way from Natal to Volksrust. He has refused to offer bail. Mr. Gandhi has sent a telegram to the Public Prosecutor that they had no authority to arrest the man. And if he was detained without trial, he would himself take up the case. It is not possible to prosecute this man. For, he has only recently entered the Transvaal from Natal. The Government had no power to arrest him until after eight days. This is the line along which this case should be fought. For, it is necessary that people coming from outside should have an opportunity  to remain free in this manner for eight days. In that case, the trial can take place only in Johannesburg, and passive resistance will gain strength. I congratulate the Konkanis on the fact that this passive resister is a Konkani. The case will be taken up on Friday. The magistrate has fixed the bail at £10. But no one has offered it. There is a telegram from Volksrust stating that Mr. Mahomed Essak remains brave and fearless.
 ABOUT COMPROMISE
 Negotiations for a compromise are continuing. People are in such a strong position that now they wish even to back out of  voluntary registration, and assert that there should be no compromise with the Government at all, that the fight should continue, and that they should retain whatever documents they hold and merely mark time. This spirit is quite admirable. [But] the time has now come for the community to show some prudence. What is being offered by way of compromise all these twelve months cannot be withdrawn now. There was a meeting on Wednesday in the Hamidia Hall. But, at that meeting, it was strongly urged by many people that we should only cling to the old documents, and that there should be no voluntary exchange of these documents. I hope that this enthusiasm will subside and that the people, having calmed down, will put forward reasonable demands. I consider it a great victory that the law should be defeated. And it is bound to be defeated if people remain firm in their attitude. But, at the same time, it is necessary to prove that we are reasonable and that we honour our word. Just as we think it criminal to violate an
 oath, so also it is disgraceful for us to back out of the promise of voluntary registration given by us.
 MEETING ON SUNDAY
 A meeting is to take place on Sunday to consider the matter further. If, in the end, the community acts with  moderation, the present wave of excitement will be taken in a good light.
 PUNDIT
 Mr. Ram Sundar Pundit will be released from Johannesburg prison on the 13th at 9 o’clock in the morning. A large number of Johannesburg Indians are expected to turn up to receive him at that time. It is intended to hold a meeting here after receiving him.libtech_463_footnoteIt will be in the fitness of things if people outside send telegrams offering congratulations and exhorting [him] to show himself brave enough to go to gaol again, if necessary.
 PUNJABIS
 A European has addressed a letter to Lord Selborne recommending that the Punjabis and others should be enlisted for the Zulu War. Lord Selborne has replied to the petition of the Punjabis that it has been forwarded to the local Government.
 CORRIGENDUM
 When I wrote last week, the amount under consideration for being sent to our delegates to the [Indian National] Congress was £25 only. Later it was decided to send £35. Accordingly, a cheque for £35 has been dispatched to Mr. Ameeroodeen.

 [VOLKSRUST,
 December 9, 1907]
 In cross-examination, the witness  admitted  that  the  permits  produced  by the men had hitherto been accepted under instructions as sufficient authority for Asiatics to enter or re-enter. The witness did not know whether re-entry was in accordance withthe permits or the Peace Preservation Ordinance. He allowed Asiatics to re-enter, such being his instructions.
[GANDHIJI:] What are your instructions now?
 [WITNESS:] My instructions are to detain and arrest all male Asiatics above 16 years who could not produce registration certificates under the Asiatic Act, or who did not produce temporary authorisation allowing them to re-enter the Colony.
 Do these instructions apply even to Asiatics whom you may know to be old residents, who may have produced permits, and who may have only recently left the Colony?
 Yes, because such is my duty under the instructions. I am to detain all Asiatics without distinction, if they cannot produce authority under the new Act.
 In answer to farther questions, Sergeant Mansfield produced the permits and registration certificates and said that they were taken out under Law 3 of 1885. This closed the case for the Crown.
 Mr. Gandhi urged that Crown witness had proved his clients’ case. The question before the Court was purely one as to whether his clients possessed permits issued under the Peace Preservation Ordinance. These permits were produced by Sergeant Mansfield who admitted that they were in order.
 MR. DE VILLIERS: Then you argue that the matter is purely one of argument of
 law?   MR. 	GANDHI: 	Precisely, Your Worship. Mr. 	Mentz then argued that the permits held by the men were authority 	only to 
  enter 	and reside in the Colony, but not to leave it and re-enter. It was 	contended that once the men left the Colony, the permits stood 	cancelled.  Mr. 	Gandhi, in reply, said that the question was not even that of 	re-entry. The Court had to keep within the four corners of the 	indictment, which charged his clients    
 with having entered the Colony without permits under Section 5 of the Peace Preservation Ordinance. The evidence before the Court conclusively proved that his clients were actually in possession of their permits on entering. They had all, moreover, paid £3 under Law 3 of 1885. Nor could the Public Prosecutor’s contention be justified. The Supreme Court had decided in the case of Bhabha vs. Rex that a permit to enter the Colony included permission to leave it and to re-enter. These were almost the exact words used by Justice Bristowe in that case. Whichever way, therefore, the case was looked at, his clients were entitled to a discharge. The Court had nothing to do with instructions from the Law Department or the construction that it might have placed upon Section 5 of the Peace Preservation Ordinance. The proper course would certainly, in his opinion, have been for the Asiatic Office, if his clients had committed a breach of the new Act, to have charged them under it.libtech_465_footnote

297,"December 	12, 1907",LETTER TO “INDIAN OPINION”,"
           TO THE 	EDITOR     JOHANNESBURG,  December 	12, 1907 
 INDIAN 	OPINION SIR,  	Perhaps you will allow me the hospitality of your columns to draw 	the attention of the public to the lesson of the thirty-eight 	prosecutionslibtech_466_footnoteof 	   British    Indians,    seemingly    under    the    Peace 	Preservation Ordinance but really under the Asiatic Registration 	Act.  	The lesson is that the proceedings of the Asiatic Office are all 	secret. It required the arrest of Punia to learn that illegal 	instructions were given to arrest Indian women though they may be 	wives accompanying their husbands duly authorised to enter the 	Colony, unless the women themselves held permits.  	It required the prosecution of a lad of twelve to learn that secret 	and illegal instructions were issued that innocent children should 	hold separate permits. It 	required the incarceration of Ram Sundar Punditlibtech_467_footnotelibtech_468_footnoteto 	learn that      
 the Asiatic Office was not governed by ordinary and known rules for investigation into charges against Asiatics.
 Lastly, it required the arrest of thirty-eight Indians and their detention from two to four days to learn that the Asiatic Office had suddenly, after five years’ practice to the contrary, discovered that permits issued under the Peace Preservation Ordinance did not cover temporary withdrawal from and return to the Colony. Instructions as to the new reading of the law were given secretly and without the Indians having been previously informed. The public do not know that these self-same men were actually examined by the Transvaal Asiatic Officer posted at Durban and passed by him. Thirty-six of these men were return passengers by the Sultan. The Asiatic Office took, I am told, three days to examine these men.
 And yet Mr. Lindsay, who as a lawyer ought to know better, glibly talks of surreptitious entry without, I dare say, having taken the trouble of ever even thinking that there might possibly be an Indian side to the story.
 Passive resisters depend upon creating public opinion, though they are not turned from their conscientious purpose if they cannot create it in their favour. It will not be denied that their suffering has at last made some public men in this Colony think. May I ask them and others who still continue to disregard the Indian standpoint whether it is not the sacred duty of Indians to refuse to submit to an Act which concentrates arbitrary powers in the hands of a single man who carries on inquiries in secrecy, issues instructions under secrecy, and condemns   men   without   hearing   them?   Even   Dinuzululibtech_469_footnotelibtech_470_footnote,   who   is suspected of rebellious designs, is not condemned on suspicion and without getting a hearing, although Colonel McKenzielibtech_471_footnotelibtech_472_footnotehas received absolute powers under the proclamation of Martial Law in Zululand. Why should Indians be expected to labour uncomplainingly under the foul charge of organised fraudulent entry and to submit to non-jud- icial investigation under the Asiatic Act of their title to remain in the country? If their repudiation of the charge were hollow, would they not rather that the whole matter were hushed up than that, as they have repeatedly asked, it should be inquired into openly and judiciously?
 I am, etc.,

APPENDICES
 
  APPENDIX I  PETITION TO 	CHINESE AMBASSADOR       TO       JOHANNESBURG,  October 14, 	1907 
 HIS 	EXCELLENCY 	THE ENVOY-EXTRAORDINARY  AND 	MINISTER-PLENIPOTENTIARY OF  HIS 	IMPERIAL 	MAJESTY 	THE 	EMPEROR 	OF 	CHINA 	LONDON  THE 	PETITION OF 	LEUNG QUINN 	IN HIS 	CAPACITY AS 	CHAIRMAN OF 	THE CHINESE ASSOCIATION 	OF THEIR 	TRANSVAAL HUMBLY 	SHEWETH THAT:   Your 		Petitioner is 		the Chairman 		of the 		Chinese Association 		established in 		Johannesburg four 		years ago 		to represent 		the free Chinese 		population of 		the Transvaal.  The 		free Chinese population 		is at present 		estimated at 		over 1,100, the 		majority of 		whom are 		settled in Johannesburg.  The 		majority of 		the Chinese 		in the 		Transvaal are 		storekeepers of 		good standing 		and are all old 		residents of 		the Colony.  Your 		Petitioner invites Your 		Excellency's attention 		to the 		Asiatic Law 		Amendment Act passed by the Transvaal Legislature, copy whereof is hereto attached.  The 		said measure was 		first passed during the 		latter part of 		last year, and 		it was 		so deeply 		resented by the 		Chinese community 		of the 		Transvaal that it 		was considered advisable 		to send 		a special 		representative to London 		to plead 		the cause 		of the 		Chinese before Your 		Excellency's 		predecessor, so that 		proper representations 		might be 		made to 		the British 		Government, and your 		Petitioner is 		glad to 		be able to 		say that, 		as a result 		of the efforts 		made by Your 		Excellency's predecessor, the 		measure was 		suspended by 		His Majesty's Government.  It 		was then re-passed 		unanimously with 		very great haste by 		the newly-elected 		Transvaal Parliament.  In 		the humble 		opinion of the 		Chinese Association, 		the measure 		fails totally 		to recognise 		our ancient 		civilisation and the 		fact of our 		being an 		independent sovereign nation.  It 		places Chinese subjects 		on the 		same level as British 		subjects coming from India. While it may be proper for the British Government to treat its Indian  
 subjects as it pleases, your Petitioner respectfully submits that subjects of the Chinese Empire should not be treated in a manner derogatory to the dignity of the Empire to which Your Excellency's Petitioner has the honour to belong, especially in view of the fact that China is a State in alliance with Great Britain and that the subjects of Great Britain receive the most-favoured-nation treatment in China.
  The 	Asiatic Act 	requires, under insulting 	and heavy 	penalties, every 	Chinaman, among 	others, resident in 	the Transvaal 	to take 	out a 	new registration 	certificate in 	place of 	the documents 	already held by him. 	It subjects 	[the] Chinese to  a 	system of 	inspection which is 	utterly degrading. It 	requires even children 	under 16  to 	be registered by 	their parents in 	a most humiliating 	manner. It requires 	adult male Chinese 	and their children 	to give 	18 finger-prints, 	a requirement 	which is 	insisted upon 	only in connection 	with habitual 	criminals. The 	legislation proceeds upon 	the assumption, 	totally denied by the 	Chinese Association, that 	many of the 	Chinese are 	capable of 	fraudulent 	representations. It 	reduces [the] Chinese to 	a level 	lower than that 	of the 	natives of 	South Africa and 	other coloured 	people. In 	short, it 	is such legislation as can be accepted only by slaves, not free men.  The 	feeling of 	the Chinese 	community being as above 	described, it has 	decided not 	to submit to 	the Act and to suffer any 	consequences that may 	follow such 	breach of 	the law. 	The community 	understands that total 	material ruin 	may follow 	passive resistance to 	the law and that every 	Chinaman may 	even be deported. 	Over 900 	members of 	the community 	have signed 	a solemn 	declaration not to 	accept the 	degrading Act.  The 	Chinese Association 	recognises that 	immigration into 	the Transvaal 	should be regulated and that an effective check should be placed 	upon illicit entry into 	the Transvaal Colony and, 	in order 	to assist 	the Local Government 	in so 	doing, the 	Chinese Association has 	offered to 	submit to 	voluntary re-registration 	as a test 	merely of the bona 	fides of the Chinese 	community, and not by way 	of admission that any 	such re-registration is 	necessary. It 	is the compulsion 	in a matter 	of this 	kind which 	your Petitioner’s Association resents.  If 	the voluntary 	offer cannot be accepted 	and substantial 	relief cannot be 	granted, in 	the opinion 	of the 	Chinese Association, 	strong representations should 	be made 	to the 	British Government 	that every 	Chinaman should be sent 	back to China, 	subject to full 	compensation being 	paid to 	him for deprivation 	of vested 	rights as 	to trade, residence, etc.  In 	conclusion, your 	Petitioner respectfully 	trusts that the rights 	of the 	Chinese subjects resident 	in the Transvaal 	will be fully 	protected by Your 	Excellency; and 	for this act 	of justice 	and mercy, 	your Petitioner shall, as 	in duty bound, for 	ever pray, etc.

Every 	person found 	in this 	Colony who 	is reasonably 	suspected of being a prohibited 	immigrant may be 	arrested without warrant 	by any 	magistrate, justice of 	the peace, 	police officer or officer 	of the 	department and 	shall as 	soon as 	possible be 	brought before a court of resident magistrate to be dealt with according to law.  No 	prohibited immigrant 	shall be 	exempt from 	the provisions of 	this Act 	or allowed to 	remain in 	this Colony by 	reason only that he 	had not been informed 	that he could 	not enter 	the Colony 	or that 	he may 	have been allowed to 	enter through 	oversight or 	owing to 	the fact being 	undiscovered that 	he was a prohibited immigrant.  Any 	person ordered to 	be removed from 	this Colony under 	this Act and any 	other person who 	shall have been convicted 	under section seven of 	aiding or 	abetting him 	in entering 	or remaining 	in the 	Colony in 	contravention of 	this Act 	shall be liable to pay all expenditure incurred by the Government in carrying out such

   Every 		such book shall 		be open 		to the 		inspection of 		any police 		officer or officer of the department at all reasonable times.  Any 		person failing to 		comply with 		the requirements  of  this 		section or 		obstructing or 		preventing any 		such officer in 		carrying out 		his powers thereunder or 		making any 		false entry in 		such book 		shall be 		guilty of 		an offence and 		shall be 		liable on 		conviction to 		a fine not 		exceeding twenty 		pounds or in default 		of payment 		to imprisonment 		not exceeding 		one month 		or to both 		such fine and such imprisonment.  
  The 	burden of 	proving that 	a person 	has not entered 	or remained 	in this 	Colony in contravention 	of this 	Act or 	any regulation 	shall in 	any prosecution 	for such 	contravention lie upon 	the accused person.  Every 	court of resident 	magistrate shall have 	jurisdiction to 	impose the 	maximum penalties for all contraventions of this Act or of any regulation.  The 	Governor may 	from time to time 	make, alter or rescind 	regulations not 	inconsistent with 	the provisions 	of this 	Act for all or 	any of 	the following 	purposes: 
 Prescribing the powers and duties of officers of the department,  For 	preventing the 	entrance of prohibited 	immigrants into  this 	 Colony, For 	the removal from this 	Colony of persons 	ordered under this Act to 	be removed therefrom, For 	the detention pending 	removal of persons 	ordered under this Act to 	be removed 	from the Colony, Prescribing 	the diseases 	which are infectious 	or contagious 	diseases for the 	purposes of 	sub-section (6) 	of the definition of prohibited 
 
 immigrant,
  Prescribing 	the forms 	of (i) 	the certificate mentioned 	in sub-section 	(g) of the 	classes of 	persons excluded 	from the 	definition of 	prohibited immigrant; 	(ii) the warrants 	to be issued 	by the Minister 	under sections five 	and Six; 	(iii) the 	book to 	be kept under section twelve,  Prescribing 	the conditions 	under which prohibited immigrants may 	be allowed 	to pass 	through this Colony 	while journeying 	to a place 	outside the same,  Generally 	for the better 	carrying out of 	the objects 	and purposes 	of this Act, 
 and may by any such regulations prescribe penalties for contraventions thereof not exceeding a fine of one hundred pounds or in default of payment imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months or both such fine and such imprisonment.
  This 	Act may be 	cited for 	all purposes as 	the Immigrants 	Restriction Act 	1907 and 	shall take effect on 	such date as 	may be declared by 	proclamation of 	the Governor 	in the Gazette.

 APPENDIX IV
 SOUTH AFRICA BRITISH INDIAN COMMITTEE
 28 QUEEN ANNE’S CHAMBERS, BROADWAY,
 WESTMINSTER, S.W.,
 August 14, 1907
TO
 THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN, G.C.B.,P .C.,&C. PRIME MINISTER
 
 SIR,     A 	deputation of my Committee, a list of whose names I have the honour 	to 
  enclose 	herewith, is desirous of waiting upon you for the purpose of 	respectfully placing before you their views upon the position and 	treatment of their Indian fellow-subjects in the Transvaal Colony.  By 	way of introduction, they have desired me to submit to you the 	following facts:  The 	British Indian population of this Colony which, as will later be 	shown is  practically 	stationary, is, according to recent census returns, about 10,000. 	The majority belong to the trading class and are shopkeepers and 	hawkers. The remainder are marked gardeners, native jewellery 	artificers, tailors, &c. There are virtually no Indian coolies, 	miners, or mechanics.  You 	will be aware that “Asiatics” (including British Indians) were 	subjected by the late Transvaal Government to certain disabilities 	in addition to those shared by non-Asiatic aliens, and that Law 3 of 	1885, while not restricting Asiatic immigration into the State, 	imposed a £3 registration fee, denied the right to acquire 	Burghership, prohibited registration of fixed property in their 	names, and made them liable to be relegated to certain streets, 	wards and locations. These disabilities, particularly the 	deprivation of the right to acquire Burghership, were undoubtedly 	largely due to colour prejudice. Under the old Grondwet, the line 	between white and coloured was distinctly drawn. It is there laid 	down that “there shall be no equality between coloured and white”. 
 Against this differential legislation numerous representations and protests were from time to time made to the Transvaal Government  by  His  Majesty’s Ministers, notably Lord Derby and Mr. Chamberlain. These are well summarised in the words of a despatch of July 20th, 1904, from the Right Honourable Alfred Lyttelton to the High Commissioner:
 “Up to the outbreak of war, therefore, the British Government had steadily maintained, at first as a matter of right and, subsequent to the Award of 1895 by diplomatic persuasion, the interest of British Indians resident in the Transvaal, and the treatment of those fellow subjects formed part of the British case against the late South African Republic.”
 It is doubtless also unnecessary to remind you of the important hospital and other services voluntarily rendered during the war by British Indians domiciled in South Africa. Not unnaturally those of the Transvaal confidently expected that incorporation of the Transvaal territory within the Empire would see the prompt removal of their disabilities, and their restoration to equality with their fellow subjects. Although, however, annexation of the Transvaal was followed by the prompt repeal of very many of the old statutes of the Republic, Law 3 of 1885 was, to their unspeakable disappointment, retained on the Statute Book of the new Colony. Moreover, immigration was restricted to the return of pre-war residents, the Peace Preservation Ordinance, passed by the new Government for the purpose of excluding enemies of the new State, being applied to keep out would-be Asiatic newcomers. A special department was, for the first time, established to regulate and supervise the return of domiciled Asiatics, who experienced numerous and grievous delays in obtaining permits to return to their homes and businesses. In 1903, the High Commissioner decided to strictly enforce the provisions of Law 3 of 1885, which, owing to representations by His Majesty’s Government, had to a great extent remained a dead letter under the Boer regime. All Asiatics who could not satisfy the authorities that they had already paid the £3 registration fee were compelled to disburse. Five thousand and sixty-six Indians and five hundred and fifteen Chinese paid a total of £9,059. The whole character of the registration was altered. Under the Republic, this, when required at all, had merely consisted in the passing to the payer of the receipt for the £3. The Registrar of Asiatics reported in 1904 that, with three exceptions, no Asiatic registers or records compiled by the late Boer Government (if such records ever were kept) were found in any district. Re-registration now for the first time assumed the character of identification. Instead of being mere receipts for the £3 fee, the certificates issued contained names of holders, their wives, number of children, the age of the holders, and their distinctive marks and thumb prints. Protestations by the British Indian community against the step proposed, on the ground that having already complied with the requirements of the law they were not compellable to re-register, were met by the recommendation of  the  High Commissioner to acquiesce in the new requirement, His Lordship assuring them:
 “I think that registration is a protection to them. To that registration there is attached a £3 tax. It is only asked for once, those who have paid it to the old
 Government have only to prove that they have done so, and they have not to pay it again. Again, once on the register, their position is established and no further registration is necessary, nor is a fresh permit required. That registration gives you a right to be here and a right to come and go:”
 The British Indian community thereupon voluntarily assented to the new re- registration and without statutory or other compulsion, one and all took out the passes required. These passes bearing the identification particulars previously described are to-day held by every resident British Indian practically without exception.
 Virtually no relaxation has taken place in the old restrictions against the holding of fixed property.
 During 1902 and 1903, considerable correspondence passed between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of the Transvaal Colony on the subject of  segregation of Asiatics (including British Indians) in bazaars or locations specially set apart for them, and also with a view to curtailing their right to demand licences to trade where they chose in the Colony.
 A refusal in 1904 to issue renewal of a shop licence to Habib Motan, of Pretoria and Pietersburg, resulted in a Supreme Court judgment vindicating their right to trade outside locations.
 In 1903, correspondence passed between the Transvaal Government and the Government of India on the subject of coolie labour for the Transvaal mines. Negotiations proved abortive, the Government of India insisting upon the removal of certain disabilities suffered by the resident Indian mercantile community of the Colony as a necessary condition to its assent, the Transvaal Government finding itself unable to agree.
 In the same year, certain proposed legislation was submitted to His Majesty’s Government by the Government of the Transvaal, under which such rights as still remained to the Asiatic community were threatened with still further curtailment, to which His Majesty’s Government replied in the following terms:
 “But an apprehended trade competition from the British Indians now in the country, whose number is now comparatively small and will, under the proposed restrictions upon immigrants, be in a diminishing proportion, cannot be accepted as sufficient reason for the legislation proposed. His Majesty’s Government have steadily declined to allow this fear to influence their views in the past. On the contrary for many years they repeatedly protested before the Empire and the civilized world against the policy and laws of the late South African Republic in relation to this subject.
 “These laws were indeed only partially enforced, while His Majesty’s Government is now asked not merely to sanction their strict enforcement, but to set aside by legislation a judgment of the Supreme Court, which has given to the British Indian rights for which His Majesty’s Government have strenuously contended.
 “His Majesty’s Government cannot believe that the British community in the
 Transvaal appreciate the true nature of the proposition which some of its members are pressing upon you. They as Britons are as jealous of the honour of the British name as ourselves and, even if a material sacrifice were necessary to vindicate that honour, I feel assured that they would cheerfully make it. His Majesty’s Government hold that it is derogatory to national honour to impose on resident British subjects disabilities against which we had remonstrated, and to which even the law of the late South African Republic, rightly interpreted, did not subject them, and they do not doubt that when  this is perceived, the public opinion of the Colony will not any longer support the demand which has been put forward.”
 With the advent to office of the present Government, British Indians in the Transvaal entertained the utmost confidence that, even if no removal of existing disabilities followed, the community would at least be firmly protected from any further encroachments upon their remaining rights.
 You will recall the circumstances attending the disallowance in 1906 of the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, and you will likewise be aware that, despite numerous appeals and protests, identically the same measure has been passed with the sanction of His Majesty’s Government by the present Responsible Government of the Transvaal.
 Representations by my Committee to His Majesty’s Government and to General Botha in person were received with assurances that the law in question would be administered by the Transvaal Government in the mildest and least irksome manner. Unhappily, that Government has apparently not seen its way to temper the severity which characterised the original Ordinance, sanction to which was refused, nor yet the Regulations under which it is to be administered.
 The new Act has aroused the utmost indignation throughout the British Indian community, and has stirred this ordinarily docile and law-abiding people in a wholly unprecedented manner. They protest against it chiefly on the following grounds:
  It 	violates the 	assurances of 	the High Commissioner 	given to 	them in 	1903, when 	they voluntarily assented 	to re-registration.  It 	nullifies their present title 	to be in the country, 	and at a stroke invalidates 	existing permits and 	certificates, throwing 	upon the holders 	the burden 	of proving their title to them.  In 	place of 	voluntary registration 	assented to in deference 	to white 	colonial prejudice 	and suspicion, 	it imposes 	compulsory registration under most 	humiliating and, 	to sensitive 	British Indians, 	revolting conditions 	and degrades them as a 	community to 	the level 	of the 	South African savage. 	They become 	a people 	branded by 	law with 	the bar-sinister 	of inferiority.  It 	is, they fear, but 	a prelude to 	still further 	restrictions upon their liberties, 	and to the enactment of similar legislation in other South African Colonies.  It 	presupposes a 	criminal complicity in 	a conspiracy, 	of which 	they have been 	accused, to 	flood the 	country with 	Asiatics, but 	which they have 	persistently denied, and in regard to which they have repeatedly called for a Commission of 
 Enquiry.
 It is reactionary legislation and opposed to the best British traditions. 
 The objection of the community is thus not to re-registration per se, which indeed they have offered to again voluntarily undergo. It is to the communal humiliation and degradation felt by them to result from such differential class legislation.
 Mass meetings attended bylibtech_473_footnoteas many as 2,000 British Indians have recently been held, at which shopkeepers of position and importance, as well as smaller traders and hawkers, solemnly pledged themselves to submit to the last penalties of the law, and sacrifice not only personal liberty, but every worldly possession, rather than re-register in terms of the new Act. The Asiatics of Pretoria were notified that they must apply for the new certificates before the beginning of the present month. They have preferred to incur liability to heavy fine and deportation and have held severely aloof.
 Besides the representations of my Committee, British Indians themselves have made numerous appeals to the Transvaal Government, praying for a consideration of the matter from their point of view, but without avail.
 My Committee now feel that the time has arrived for intercession by the Imperial Government, and they would respectfully urge that, in their humble opinion, British Indians of the Transvaal have not been restored to those rights to which, as civilized subjects of the Empire, they are entitled, nor yet have received  the  protection due to them from His Majesty’s Government from the imposition of further disabilities since the annexation.
 The claims of the British Indians are most modest:
   Repeal 		of the 		new law requiring 		compulsory re-registration and, 		as an 		alternative, acceptance of 		their offer to 		re-register voluntarily; 		existing certificates 		to be surrendered for a new document to be mutually agreed upon, 		failures to 		voluntarily register, 		should any such occur 		(which is most 		unlikely), to be met 		by a 		subsequent short 		Act empowering 		expulsion of Asiatics 		not in 		possession of 		the new certificate; Repeal of Law 3 of 1885 as far as it applies to British Indians. But:   The 			right of 			the European 			colonists to limit 			the influx 			of Asiatic 			is admitted. Such 			restriction is 			now effected under the Peace Preservation 			Ordinance, and an 			Immigration Restriction 			Bill is 			already gazetted to 			still further limit 			such immigration;  The 			principle of 			control of 			the issue 			of trading 			licenses by Licensing 			Boards (with power of 			appeal from their 			decision to the 			Supreme Court) 			is likewise accepted;  In 			deference to 			existing prejudices of 			the white colonists, 			neither political nor 			municipal power is demanded.   
 
 It is perhaps superfluous to add that this matter is not one touching merely the domestic concerns of the Colony but is one of highest Imperial importance, and far-reaching in its consequences.
 It is confidently anticipated that friendly representations by His Majesty’s Government to the Government of the Transvaal on behalf of the British Indians in question would have the desired effect.
 I am desired to add that should you signify your willingness to receive the deputation, you will kindly name alternative dates, as some members of my Committee have numerous engagements which they might find it impossible to postpone.
 I have, &c.,

 APPENDIX V
 A PRIZE OF TEN GUINEAS
 For an Essay on “The Ethics of Passive Resistance”
 As this journal has, in a humble way, led the battle of passive resistance now being offered by the Indians in the Transvaal against an Act which, in their opinion, does violence to their consciences and as the controllers of the policy of this journal are desirous of showing the general utility of the doctrine of passive resistance, the management have decided to offer, as they now do, a prize of ten guineas for the best essay on “The Ethics of Passive Resistance”. The doctrine, religiously construed, means a fulfilment of Jesus’ famous saying, “Resist not evil”. As such, it is of eternal and universal application, and if it were practised largely, it would replace, to a great extent if not entirely, brute force and other kindred methods for securing redress of grievances or inauguration of reforms. The management, therefore, trust that the best men in South Africa, having leisure, will compete for the prize, not for its monetary value, but with a view to an elucidation of [a] principle of life which, although it has the sanction of the best minds of the world, is still little understood and less practised.
 The terms of competition are as follows:
  The 	essay should 	be written clearly, 	on side of the paper 	only,  or 	 preferably typed. The competitor’s name should not appear on the manuscript.  It 	may be 	divided into 	four chapters and 	should not 	cover more than ten 	columns of Indian Opinion.  It 	should contain 	an examination 	of Thoreau’s 	classic, “On the Duty 	of Civil 	Disobedience”, Tolstoy’s works—more especially “The Kingdom 	of Heaven 	is Within You”—and 	it should give Biblical 	and other 	religious authorities and 
 illustrations; and also the application of the “Apology of Socrates” to the question. The essay should give illustrations from modern history in support of the doctrine.
  It 	should be 	addressed: The 	Editor, Indian 	Opinion, 	Phoenix, Natal, and 	should reach not 	later than the 	30th instant.  The 	management reserve to 	themselves the 	right to 	publish and 	translate any of the contributions received, and to reject all if none is considered suitable.libtech_474_footnote

 APPENDIX VII
 BRITISH INDIANS AND THE TRANSVAAL
 L. W. RITCH PREFACE
 Frequent requests for a concise statement of the Transvaal British Indian grievances suggested the writing of a short history of the matter. The following is an attempt to place the facts, briefly, before an increasingly interested public.
 The author is indebted to Blue Books for as much of the history as preceded his own advent [in]to the Transvaal. The facts of the last eighteen years fall within his own experience.
 This little work has no pretensions to literary merit. An advance plea of “guilty” is entered in respect of its doubtless numerous defects of style and diction. It is to the facts that attention is respectfully directed.

432	THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
 
 UNDER THE BOER REPUBLIC
 The history of the disabilities under which British Indians labour in the Transvaal dates back to the controversy of 1885 between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of the Transvaal Republic about what time the latter was pressed to legislate against so-called Arab traders, many of whom were really British Indians, by rival European storekeepers, many of whom were neither Transvaal burghers nor yet British subjects.
 ARTICLE 14 OF THE LONDON CONVENTION had provided that all persons, other
than natives, conforming themselves to the laws of the South African Republic:
 Should have full liberty with their families to enter, travel, or 
 reside
 in any part of the South African Republic;
 Should 	be entitled 	to hire or possess 	houses, manufactories, 
 warehouses, shops, and premises,
 Might carry on their commerce either in person or by any agents 
 whom
 they might think fit to employ.
 In 1885 the State Secretary of the Transvaal communicated to Lord Derby (then Secretary of State for the Colonies) the proposal of his Government to legislate for the regulation of the Orientals (mostly shopkeepers) who had settled in the Republic, and asked for anexpression of the opinion of his Majesty’s Government as to whether, under Article 14 referred to, such legislation would be considered intravires.
 Sir Hercules Robinson, then High Commissioner, endorsed the State Secretary’s letter with a recommendation that Article 14 aforesaid should be amended by the substitution for the word “natives” of the words “African natives or Chinese coolie immigrants”, the idea being to Safeguard the interests of the “Arab” traders already established, leaving the Republic free to legislate for Asiatics of an inferior class such as coolie immigrants. Eventually, the South African Republic passed LAW
 3 or 1885, SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED IN 1886, which applied to  “the  persons belonging to one of the aboriginal races of Asia”, they being thereby:
  Required 	to pay 	a fee 	of £3 for 	the privilege of 	trading or 	residing in 	the Republic; Precluded 	[from] the exercise 	of burger rights; Forbidden 	to hold 	fixed property registered in 	their names;  Liable 	to reside 	only in 	such streets, 	wards, and locations 	as might 	be indicated. 
 Soon complaints were heard from the British Indian trading community, the South African Republic claiming to apply the law to all Asiatics within the Republic without distinction. It is practically certain that there has never been any of Indian coolies proper into the Transvaal. Law 3 of 1885 could, therefore, only have been conceived with an eye to its application to the “Arab” trader, and it becomes evident that, in assenting to the above proposal of January 6, the Imperial Government and
 
 the Government of the Republic were not ad idem.
 Representations by the Imperial Government that the interpretation of Law 3 constituted a violation of the agreement under which the Imperial Government had assented to the passing of the law, as well as a contravention of the London Convention, resulted in compromise, the words “for sanitary purposes” being added as a qualification of the clause referring to the residence in streets, wards, and locations, and the right to hold fixed property in such streets, &c., so appointed, “for sanitary purposes”, being conceded. But here, again, “His Majesty’s Government understood that the law, even as amended, was a sanitary measure, and consequently would not apply to traders and other persons of a superior mode of life, but to coolies only.” They accordingly accepted the amended law, and waived the point about the contravention of Article 14 of the London Convention.
 The Government of the Republic maintained, however, that the law should apply to all Asiatics alike, and, therefore, interpreted the phrase “ residence” to include trade as well as private dwellings. Further negotiations between the two Governments resulted in a reference to arbitration, the outcome of which was an Award, deciding that the government of the Republic was entitled to give full force and effect to the law under discussion, “subject to sole and exclusive interpretation in the ordinary course by the tribunals of the country”. This Award was accepted, in so far as it was taken to have “closed the legal andinternational question in dispute” between the two Governments. But Mr. Chamberlain expressly reserved to himself the liberty to make friendly representations to the Government of the Republic on behalf of the Indian traders, with whom he expressed sympathy, and possibly to invite the Government of the Republic
 “To consider whether...it would not be wise to review the situation from a new point of view, and decide whether it would not be better, in the interest of its own burghers, to treat the Indians more generously, and to free itself from even the appearance of countenancing a trade jealousy, which he had some reasons to believe did not emanate from the governing class in the Republic.”*
 In 1898 the Supreme Court of the Transvaal interpreted “residence” to include trade, Tajob Hadji Mahomed Khan, a British Indian, receiving notice to leave Pretoria as a residence and place of business, and this, by implication, applying to all British Indians without distinction.
 Further correspondence passed between the two Governments, the efforts of the Transvaal Government being obviously directed towards legislation based upon considerations of colour, as indicated by the proposal to include in the operation of Law 3 “Cape coloured persons as well as Asiatics”, those of the Imperial Government being characterised by a desire to preserve from the degrading effects of the law all who were not mere coolies. In the words of Mr. Lyttelton:
 
 Mr. Lyttelton to Viscount Milner, July 20, 1904, C.D. 2, 239
 “Up to the outbreak of war, therefore, the British Government had steadily maintained, at first as a matter of right, and subsequently to the Award of 1895 by diplomatic persuasion, the interests of British Indians resident in the Transvaal, and the treatment of these fellow-subjects formed part of the British case against the late South African Republic.”
 The manner in which the differential legislation against the resident British Indian community of the Transvaal was regarded by other prominent statesmen may be gathered from the now historic utterances of Lords Lansdowne and Selborne. In view of more recent legislation in the new Transvaal Colony, the words may well bear repetition. Speaking at Sheffield in 1899, the Marquis of Lansdowne said:
 “A considerable number of the Queen’s Indian subjects are to be found in the Transvaal, and among the many misdeeds of the South African Republic. I do not know that any fills me with more indignation than its treatment of those Indians. And the harm is not confined to the sufferers on the spot; for what do you imagine would be the effect produced in India when these poor people return to their country to report to their friends that the Government of the Empress, so mighty and irresistible in India, with its population of three hundred millions, is powerless to secure redress at the hands of a small South African State?”
 Lord Selborne’s views are no less impressive:
 “Was it, or was it not,” asked his Lordship, “our duty to see that our dusky fellow-subjects in the Transvaal, where they had a perfect right to go, should be treated as the Queen in our name had promised they should be treated? If they agreed with him, and admitted that these were questions which we had to answer, as trustees before our fellow-countrymen and before history, then they would agree with him also that the path of duty was to be ruled, not by sentiment, but by plain facts.   We were trustees for our brothers all over
 the world.   Trustees also for our fellow-subjects of different races and different
 colours.   For all these, and the unborn children of these. Therefore the test we
 had to apply in an emergency like this was the simple test of duty. Was it, or was it not, our duty to see that the rights and the future interests of those he had named should be maintained ?.     Was the British Government going to
 make its name respected, and to have the pledges given by it faithfully observed ? Was it going to see that the British subject, wherever he went all over the world, whether he were white or black, was to have the rights which his Queen had secured for him?”
 It should, however, be borne in mind that under the Government of the Republic Law 3 was so mildly administered as to be virtually inoperative. Where the
 £3 fee was tendered, a receipt was, of course, given, and “registration” consisted in recording such payment, but no serious effort was made to enforce it. In any event, it was required only from traders, and not even in all cases from them. Most important,
 
 Mr. Lyttelton to Viscount Milner, Previously cited
 however, especially in view of the present “registration” controversy, is the fact that although the term “registration” was used in regard to the payment and receipt of this
 £3 fee, the transaction in no wise partook of the nature of personal identification, which is an entirely new development, arisen only since the annexation. There was, moreover, no restriction upon Asiatic immigration save this loosely imposed £3 payment. In this connection the report of Captain Hamilton Fowle, Registrar of Asiatics in 1903, is instructive. The report states:
 “That, with three exceptions, no Asiatic registers  or  records compiled by the late Boer Government (if such records ever were kept) were found in any district.”
 It is not surprising that Transvaal British Indians, the majority of whom were, of course, compelled to leave the country during the war, confidently looked forward to the repeal of Law 3 as soon as the British flag should float over Pretoria. True, the fact of their British citizenship had operated to protect them against many of the logical consequences of the Boer legislation, but Law 3 nevertheless irked, because it branded them as inferiors, and reduced them, if only theoretically, to a status lower than that enjoyed by them in the neighbouring colonies of the Cape and Natal, whence many of them had come. Whilst the section of Law 3 of 1885 precluding Indians from acquiring burger rights was, of course, rigidly adhered to, their liability to relegation to such streets, wards, and locations as might be indicated was under the Government of the Republic never enforced.
 SINCE THE ANNEXATION
 The earliest consequences to British Indians of the  annexation  of  the Transvaal were the exclusion of Asiatic immigrants who could not satisfy the authorities that they were bona fide pre-war residents. In 1902, a measure styled the Peace Preservation Ordinance (38 of 1902 amended by 5 of 1903) was enacted by the new Government for the “maintenance of good order and government and public safety”. Martial law had been withdrawn, and the new Ordinance was directed against sedition and treason. The amendment in 1903 required permits to be held by all entrants to the colony. The stipulation that such permits were not to be granted to burghers failing to take the oath of allegiance sufficiently indicates the purpose of the Ordinance. The new law was applied, however, as an Indian Immigration Restriction Act. For the first time in the history of the country, an Asiatic department was established. Abuse and corruption in the issue of permits resulting in the trial of two chief officials were followed by the abolition of the Asiatic department, the transfer of its business to the Chief Secretary for Permits, and the eventual appointment of an officer styled Protector of Asiatics. In 1902 the  High Commissioner telegraphed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies certain formal proposals of the Government of the Transvaal, which included the taking out of a certificate of registration by all Asiatics, whether then resident in the Transvaal or subsequently entering it, which certificate should be annually renewable at a charge of
£3; relegation of such registered Asiatics to special locations set apart for them for
 purposes of trade and residence (unless living with a European employer); the exemption from registration in the case of educated and civilised Asiatics; the right of Asiatics to acquire and hold real property in town areas. To these proposals the Secretary of State for the Colonies replied that:
 “It was impossible to defend what would practically be a continuance of the system of the South African Republic, against which His Majesty’s Government had so strongly and repeatedly protested.”libtech_475_footnote
 In 1903 certain proposals were made by the Government of the Transvaal for the importation of 10,000 coolies from India, to which the Government of India promised acquiescence, provided that existing disabilities affecting Indians already resident in the Transvaal were removed.
 In the same year a further dispatch was sent by the High Commissioner to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, enclosing a copy of the Government Notice, to the effect that the Government had resolved to put into practice that section of the Boer Law 3 of 1885 dealing with the relegation of Asiatics to special streets, wards, and locations in which alone Asiatics might reside and trade; that licences to trade elsewhere than in such locations should be refused Asiatics; that Asiatics who had held licences for trade outside bazaars at the beginning of the war might be granted renewals of such licences under the same conditions during their residence in the colony, but the licences should not be transferable; “that the educated and respectable Asiatics should be exempted from all such restrictions”. These modifications of existing disabilities were obviously directed towards satisfying the Indian Government, and inducing the latter to assent to the importation of the coolie labour required for the Transvaal public works. The Transvaal Government further proposed that immigration should be regulated by a law similar to those in force in the Cape and Natal, and to admit Indian as well as European languages in the education test to be imposed under the Act. This suggestion emanated from the Indian Government. On further consideration, however, the Government of the Transvaal retracted, and eventually opposed, the last proposal. They suggested by way of [an] alternative:
   An 		Immigration Restriction 		Law on 		the lines 		of the 		similar Cape 		and Natal Acts, 		providing, inter 		alia, an 		education test for would-be immigrants, 		for the purposes 		of which Indian 		languages should 		 not  be 		accepted; A 		measure dealing with 		Indians on 		the lines of 		the Government Notice 		(No. 356 of 1903), 		above referred to, providing:   Those 			Asiatics who satisfied 			the Colonial 			Secretary of the 			Colony that their mode 			of living 			is in accordance 			with European ideas 			should be allowed 			to live 			with their servants, outside locations, 			but not to trade outside locations 			unless they fall under (2);  That 			those Asiatics 			who had established 			business outside locations before the war should not be disturbed;   
 
    That 			with the two exceptions 			mentioned above, 			all Asiatics 			should be required 			to live 			and trade 			in locations, 			and should 			be prohibited 			from holding land outside. This provision not 			to apply 			to land now set aside 			and used for religious purposes;  All 			Asiatics entering the 			Transvaal, unless 			specially exempted, to take out a certificate of registration at a charge of £3;  No 			restriction to 			be put on the issue of hawkers’ licences, 			provided that the 			Immigration Law 			referred to 			above is passed.   
 In reply, the Secretary of State for the Colonies drew a distinction between those British Indians already resident in the Transvaal and would-be immigrants. He deprecated all save rational precautions for the safeguarding of public health and pointed out that:
 “An apprehended trade competition from the British Indians now in the country, whose number is now comparatively small, and will, under the proposed restrictions on immigration, be in a diminishing proportion, cannot be accepted as sufficient reason for the legislation proposed. His Majesty’s Government have steadily declined to allow this fear to influence their views in the past. On the contrary, for many years they repeatedly protested before the Empire and the civilised world against the policy and laws of the late South African Republic in relation to this subject. Those laws were, indeed, only partially enforced, while His Majesty’s Government is now asked not merely to sanction their strict enforcement, but to set aside by legislation the judgment of the Supreme Court, which has given to the British Indian rights for which His Majesty’s Government have strenuously contended....His Majesty’s Government hold that it is derogatory  to national honour to impose on resident British subjects disabilities against which we had remonstrated, and to which even the law of the late South African Republic, rightly interpreted, did not subject them, and they do not doubt that when this is perceived, the public opinion of the colony will not any longer support the demand which has been put forward.
 “The second Ordinance proposed, which will take the place of Law 3 of 1885, should, therefore, not interfere with the rights of those now in the country to obtain licences to trade outside locations. With regard to the
 question of the holding of land, British Indians who are entitled to reside outside locations must at least have the right to acquire property on the premises which they occupy for business purposes.”
With respect to the second—future immigrants—he added:
 “His Majesty’s Government, deeply as they regret the necessity of hindering the free movements of British Indians within the Empire, feel that they are unable to withdraw their sanction to the immediate introduction into the Legislative Council of the Transvaal of a measure restricting immigration on the lines of those Acts. It seems certain that those who
 still come in under the proposed Immigration Restriction Ordinance, and they should be very few, will not be Asiatics of a low class, and will not, therefore, be such persons as might properly be required, for sanitary reasons, to reside in a special location. I am of opinion that until it is proved that the Immigration Restriction Ordinance has failed to limit the influx to a minimum as it is expected to do, and in view of the absence of any legislation of the kind in the Cape Colony or Natal, the Ordinance to be passed in the present session should not limit the right of newcomers in respect of trade.”libtech_476_footnote
 It may be necessary to explain that towards the end of 1903 Habib Motan, a Pretoria merchant, had successfully contested the construction that had previously been placed upon Law 3 of 1885 in respect of the term “residence”. The effect of the new decision was to entitle Asiatics to trade (but not reside) outside of locations.
 In the same year the Government of the Transvaal decided to strictly enforce the section of Law 3 of 1885 requiring the payment of he £3 entrance fee, with the result that £16,743 were collected from 5,066 Indians and 515 Chinese, who were unable to satisfy the authorities that they had previously paid the fee to the Government of the Republic. Re-registration of the whole Asiatic community was likewise determined upon, against which, however, British Indians  protested, claiming that they had already fulfilled the requirements of the law. The High Commissioner advised them, however, not to press their objections. He assured them that registration was a protection to them, and added that:
 “Once on the register, their position was established, and that no further registration would be necessary, nor a fresh permit required. That registration gives you a right to be here, and a right to come and go.”
 Always anxious to conciliate, and with characteristic trust in the pledge of so high an authority, the British Indian community complied. The new certificates issued contained the names of the holders, place of birth and occupation, last address and signature, their wives, number of children, age of the holders, their distinctive marks and thumb prints.
 Thus “registration” now first became a device for the identification  of  Asiatics, including British Indians, but it was as yet voluntary registration, and not imposed by differential legislation, as has since been done in the form of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act of 1907.
 The Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance (No. 29 of 1906), subsequently re- enacted by the Responsible Government of the Transvaal, was the next step towards the reduction of the British Indian status. Under it, sub-section C of Article 2 of the Boer Law 3 of 1885, dealing with the registration of Asiatics, is repealed. This section had required only such “Asiatics”—being persons belonging to any of the native races of Asia, including the so-called coolies, Arabs, Malays, and Mahomedan
 subjects of the Turkish dominion—to “register” as chose to “settle in the Republic for the purpose of carrying on any trade or otherwise”, such “registration” to be effected within eight days after arrival, and to be effected free of charge in the case of those persons who settled in the Republic before the coming into operation of this law. There was thus no restriction upon “Asiatic” immigration, but merely a requirement, if the immigrant decided to settle, to pay a £3 fee, and so “enregister”. The repeal of this sub-section disposed of the implied right of Asiatics to enter the Transvaal in consideration of such payment. The Peace Preservation Ordinance, it may be remembered, had, since British occupation, been effectually employed to exclude Asiatic immigrants as undesirables.
 The Act of 1907 now compels every Asiatic lawfully resident in the colony to present himself afresh for registration, to satisfy the Registrar of Asiatics of his title to be in the colony, and, if successful, to submit to a personal examination prescribed under the regulations appended to the law of a character so offensive in detail as to have precipitated this hitherto submissive people into open revolt. An applicant is required to give his full name, race, caste or sect, age, physical description, residence, occupation, place of birth, date of first arrival in the Transvaal, where resident on May 31, 1902, father’s and mother’s name, wife’s name, sons and male wards under the age of eight years, their names, age, and relationship with their guardian. In addition, he is required to give the impressions of his thumb, index, middle, ring, and little fingers of both hands, and simultaneous impressions of the four fingers on each hand. It follows that existing titles of Asiatic residents obtained under the Transvaal Government, and reassured in 1903 by Lord Milner, are summarily invalidated, and the burden of re-establishing them is thrown upon their holders. Registration certificates voluntarily taken out under advice of the High Commissioner must be surrendered in exchange for other certificates, which must be carried on the person of every Asiatic of the age of sixteen years or over, and must be produced on demand made upon him by any member of a police force lawfully established in the colony or by any other person authorised by the Colonial Secretary. Registration is compulsory in respect of all lawfully resident Asiatics from eight years of age upwards, and failure on the part of the guardian of every such child under sixteen involves liability to a fine of £100, or three months’ imprisonment, with hard labour. The British Indians of the colony complain that the reduction of status suffered by them through the differential legislation of the Government of the Transvaal Republic was as nothing compared with the degradation to whichthey are now subjected under this law enacted in a British Colony. They point out that it brands them for all time as inferiors, as undesirables, and as being so untrustworthy
 as to require the identification and supervision peculiar to suspects and criminals. Be  it remembered that the Act applies to “Asiatics” lawfully resident in the colony, and that only such Asiatics as were established in the Transvaal before the annexation are “lawful residents”. The measure was explained by its framers as necessary on the ground of an alleged considerable unlawful influx of Indians into the country. No satisfactory evidence of any such considerable influx has so far been adduced. When
 
 towards the close of 1903 the then Registrar of Asiatics, Captain Hamilton Fowle, was formally interpellated as to such alleged unlawful influx, he replied that “there is no reason to believe that Asiatics are entering the colony without authority”. He further pointed out that while early in 1903 a large number of Asiatics did succeed in entering the colony without the necessary authority, they were soon arrested and sent over the border, and added, “it is practically impossible for any unauthorised Asiatic to remain in the colony for any length of time without being detected”. The more recent Chamney report consists of vague and unconvincing allegations of surreptitious entry, and is transparently inspired with a view to justifying the introduction about that time of the Ordinance. Shortly, it indicates that “during the year ending December 31, 1906, 876 male Asiatics entered or were found in the colony without permits legally held by them”. It is not denied that these “unlawful immigrants” may have entered at any time during the four years since 1902, and it is significant that only 215 of such cases were charged and convicted before the magistrates.
 The outcry of “considerable unlawful influx”, supplemented by charges of collusion between resident Asiatics and others desirous of smuggling [themselves] into the country, was met by repeated appeals from the leaders of the Indian community to appoint a Commission of Enquiry, and thereby once and for all to set any actual doubts at rest. For some unexplained reason this very sensible suggestion has been persistently ignored.
 In judging of the necessity and adequacy of the new Registration Act, it must  be remembered that the Peace Preservation Ordinance, by means of which Captain Hamilton Fowle was enabled to effectually exclude fresh Asiatic immigration, is still in operation, and heavily penalises trespassers. Asiatic applicants for re-admission are detained outside the colony pending the strictest investigation of their right to re- renter. If, for argument’s sake, there have been any such considerable infiltration as alleged, the new Registration Act provides no additional machinery for intercepting it. The Act concerns itself with the branding only of lawfully resident Asiatics. The utmost extent to which it can possibly affect the unauthorised entrant is to discover him after he has smuggled [himself] into the country; but this assumes that the delinquent will respond to the invitation to present himself for identification. If he should fail so to do, the Registration Act is no more capable of detecting him than was the Peace Preservation Ordinance, and the only weapon then left is the refusal of trading licences to non-holders of the new registration certificate. Thus it will be seen that the body of the lawfully resident Indians—merchants, small traders, laundrymen, &c.—of good reputation and long standing in the country are to be branded with the bar sinister of inferiority and reduced to the status of ticket-of-leave criminals, ostensibly in order that a few smugglers may be unearthed. The innocent are to suffer   to facilitate the discovery of suspected guilt.
 The prominence given to the humiliating regulations appended to the Act by way of illustrating its true character has been used to distract attention from the main British Indian contention. Ridicule has been cast upon an exaggerated
 sentimentalism which takes umbrage at a mere requirement to impress digit imprints upon a sheet of paper. Whilst lawyers, doctors, merchants of repute and long standing, and, for that matter, hawkers of good character might not unreasonably regard identification of so offensively minute and personal a character as casting the gravest aspersion upon their honesty and good fame, it cannot be made too clear that the regulations themselves, however repugnant, are regarded merely as an incidental, and that the root of the objection taken by British Indians is not to the details of its administration, but to the Act itself. As previously stated, submission to the Act is regarded by the Indians as involving communal degradation arising out of the compulsory statutory branding of this one particular section of the British community. Mr. Essop Ismail Mia, Chairman of the Transvaal British Indian Association, thus concisely states the case:
 “The attitude of my Association would not have been in any way altered had signatures been substituted for finger-prints. It is the sting of compulsion running throughout the Act that offends and bears so heavily on the community.        It is not the fact of the penalty or the severity of it that is
 resented, but the underlying assumption that Indians as a class are capable of
 impersonation and fraudulently bringing unauthorised immigrants into the country that is  most strongly, and  I  think rightly, objected to	knowing
 well that British Indians as a class have not been guilty of the practices above described, they manfully struggle to avoid the presumption which the Act has made tacitly, and which the framers of the law publicly declare as their conviction.”
 It is in defence of this principle—in order to preserve their individual and communal self-respect—that practically 13,000 loyal subjects of His  Imperial Majesty stand solemnly pledged to go to gaol and submit to the loss of worldly possessions, and even liberty itself. Could any more eloquent reply be returned to the taunt so often flung, that the Indian has no soul above his shop and his profits?
 THE IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION BILL constitutes the latest Transvaal product in the way of anti-Asiatic legislation. The incongruity of retaining the Peace Preservation Ordinance, enacted for the “maintenance of good order and government and public safety in view of the withdrawal of martial law”, on the Statute Book of a British colony now ruled by Ministers, who but recently were in arms against us, necessitated its early repeal. This is effected by section (I) of the Immigrants’ Restriction Bill, but the section concludes with the following significant proviso:
 “No such repeal shall affect or abridge any powers or jurisdiction by the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, 1907, conferred for the purpose of carrying out such Act, but the said Ordinance shall for all the purposes of such Act be deemed to remain of full force and effect.”
 In other words, the terms of the Peace Preservation Ordinance are preserved for exclusive application to Asiatics.
 The Bill gives permanence to the Registration Law. It disregards the right of residence of those British Indians who settled in the Transvaal before the war, and in
 
 many cases even paid £3 as the price of such residence under Law 3 of 1885, but who have for some reason or other not yet returned to the country.
 In defining the qualifications for immigration into the country, it excludes by way of educational test all save European languages and Yiddish.
 It requires even Indian applicants for admission who may pass the test prescribed by the Bill to enregister in terms of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, the registration regulations of which were ostensibly framed because of the assumed illiteracy of the majority of the Asiatics residing in the colony.
 It is argued with no little reason by the opponents of the Bill that Indians with  a sufficient knowledge of a European language to pass the educational test carry on their persons sufficient marks of identification, and that since it is hardly conceivable that any Indian of liberal education will ever accept its terms, this requirement is but an indirect mode of depriving Indians of the benefit of the  education clause of the Bill, and thus of barring their admittance into the country.
 The Bill makes no provision for facilities to Indian merchants already settled in the Transvaal for importing clerks, assistants, and servants necessary for the conduct of their business and households. Sub-section (C) of section (6) is remarkable as constituting a subtle attempt to indirectly amend the Asiatic Law Amendment Act. The latter provides for the fine and imprisonment of recalcitrant Asiatics, followed by notice to remove from the colony. Similarly, the Peace Preservation Ordinance empowers the issue of such notice to leave. Sub-section (C) of this Bill takes an important step in advance of either. It confers upon the local Government power to physically and forcibly deport at his own expense any person disregarding the notice of removal under the Asiatic Law Amendment Act. Due appreciation of the character of this measure would be impossible without a brief notice of the definition of the term
 in the Bill, “prohibited immigrant”. Asiatics incapable of writing from dictation or otherwise in a European language are classed among illiterates, paupers, prostitutes, and similar characters, as well as any person who, did he enter the colony, “would be liable to any law in force at such date which might render him liable if found therein  to be removed from, or to be ordered to leave the colony, whether on conviction of an
offence against such law or for failure to comply with its provisions or otherwise”.
 Finally, section (6) of the Bill makes a “prohibited immigrant”, and, as such, liable to forcible deportation, “any person who is deemed by the Minister on reasonable grounds to be dangerous to the peace, order and good government of the colony, if he remain therein”.
 It is objected, not without some show of reason, that the last-mentioned provisions are directed against passive resisters of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act and their leaders.
 It is prudently provided that the victims of this measure shall be liable to pay all expenditure incurred by the Government in carrying out such removal, whether from the colony or South Africa, or in the detention in the colony or elsewhere of any person pending his removal, the amount of such expenditure, on production to the Sheriff of the certificate of an officer of the Department setting out the items and total
 amount of such expenditure, to be recoverable by execution levied on the property in the colony of the person so liable, in manner provided for execution levied under a judgment of the Supreme Court.
 THE Raison D’etre
 
 If it be asked what is the motive force behind this rabid antagonism towards respectable British Asiatics, there can be but one reply. A survey of the legislation from 1885 to date, and of all that has been said and written on the subject, must make   it abundantly clear that the outcry is first and foremost an ebullition of trade jealousy. It will have been observed that, right along, the point of attack has been the trading licences. The legislators of the Republic were prompted to enact Law 3 of 1885 by European shopkeepers anxious to be rid of defenceless rivals. High above all the clamour of the “White Leaguers” of Boksburg, Krugersdorp, Potchefstroom, and similar dorps resounds the cry of “no coolie licences!” The attempt during 1903 to relegate Asiatics to bazaars was virtually abandoned, after the test case of Habib Motan v. the Transvaal Government had established the right of Asiatics to trade outside of bazaars and locations. The new Registration Act threatens non-renewal of trading licences to Asiatics failing to comply with its provisions.
 Trade rivalry, however, might in itself have proved insufficient to move the Legislature to action. Colour prejudice, seemingly indigenous to South Africa, has, therefore, been appealed to. Colonial imagination has been inflamed by hinting at the danger of complicating an already difficult situation by the presence of  a  permanent Asiatic element in addition to the existing coloured population. This argument has apparently sufficed to justify the jettisoning of pre-war pledges and obligations, and the consequent immolation of the small British Indian population upon the altar of a cheap expediency. A voiceless minority numbering less than 5 per cent. of the white population of the Transvaal, unrepresented either municipally or politically, their modest claim to reasonable treatment as civilised citizens of the Empire has been ruthlessly disregarded. The hopes and promises held out to them in the pre-war days by professed champions of their cause are, according to Sir Arthur Lawley, now more righteously broken than kept.
 It has been urged in extenuation of the anti-Indian legislation that it has the unanimous assent of the whole white population. The assertion is, however, open to serious question. It is submitted, on the other side, that only those who for selfish reasons are themselves interested in the riddance of the Indian competitor have committed themselves to any definite expression of opinion. Some have refrained from a desire to be on the winning side—the great majority, the mining and mechanic classes, from sheer indifference. But even granting such unanimous consent, can it be seriously contended that the pre-war pledges and promises, express and implied, to which this country stands committed, are to be incontinently abandoned, and that one section of the Transvaal community—the weaker—is, under the protection of our own flag, to beruthlessly down-trodden and stripped of every vestige of status at the behest of the other and stronger ?
 A detailed examination of the allegations made by those who clamour for the expulsion of the Asiatic would be interesting, were it possible within the scope of this small work. They include such pleas as “the reduction of the standard of living” and “unfair competition”; that “the Asiatic does not blend with the  European  colonists, and consequently can never be built into the body of the nation”. It may be briefly remarked, as to the former, that the British Indian does not compete with the labouring classes of the Transvaal, nor are there any Indian coolies in this colony. The shopkeepers and traders who comprise the majority of the Asiatic population, 88_ per cent of whom are British Indians, are, it is true shrewd business men, patient, persevering, and industrious; it, like their white rivals, they have rent and taxes to pay; they circulate the bulk of their receipts locally among the wholesale importers (Europeans), and not infrequently engage the services of medical men, lawyers, mechanics, &c. True, they are abstemious, especially in the matter of liquor, live a comparatively retired life, and do not dissipate their substance. Their trade lies chiefly with the poorer section of the community, and it is admitted that their competition has had the effect of keeping down the cost of the necessaries of life.
 That the Indian lives meanly is a foolish misunderstanding,  due to  the inability of the average Western to appreciate the niceties of Oriental dietary. Comparisons in such matters are particularly odious, and not infrequently dangerous to those venturing to draw them. A more intimate acquaintance with the Acts would show that Indian feeding is anything but inexpensive. One might, perhaps, fairly enquire whether the standard of comfort of even the humblest Indian hawker is inferior   to that of the unhappily large body of poor whites, bijwoners, and of Syrians, and raw Russians, the latter of whom are not inconsiderable competitors of the older white traders. Nor can it be denied that Indian stores compare favourably in every way with those of their European neighbours. The integrity and high standing of the Indian with the merchants with whom he trades are admittedly unassailable. His habits have been attacked as unsanitary. The author has enjoyed exceptional opportunities of convincing himself of the falsehood of this aspersion. During the plague of 1903-4 this cry was raised with especial vehemence, and in sheer self-protection it became necessary to obtain impartial inspection by independent medical experts. Their certificates proved conclusively that the structure and general arrangement of Indians’ shops and dwellings were, if anything, superior to the average. True, the old location on the fringe of Johannesburg, since destroyed, had been so shamefully neglected in the matter of sanitary service by the responsible authorities, that it had indeed become a veritable plague spot. The eradication of the plague was, however, very largely due to the untiring efforts, the sacrifices, and the co-operation of the Indians resident therein.
 As to the plea that the Indian will not blend with the rest of the community, what is this but a re-statement of the old fable of the boy who stoned the toad as a punishment for its being a toad? The Indian of the Transvaal a branded a pariah by statute; he is treated as such in practice; regardless of the obvious terminological inexactitude, he is indiscriminately dubbed “coolie”. One hears even in official
 circles such expressions as “coolie lawyer”, “coolie doctor”, “coolie merchant”. His women are “coolie Marys”. As has been already shown, he is accorded no place in the scheme of things, save on sufferance. He may not even own fixed property, although, curiously, he may be a mortgagee of such. He is even denied the not always obvious privilege of riding in the same municipal tramcars and Government railway carriages as his white fellow-colonists. His children are afforded no facilities for education except they attend the schools set apart for Kaffirs. Could there  be  less  encouragement for the Indian “to blend” and to associate himself more closely with the larger life of the community ?
 It is difficult to escape from the conclusion that the head and front of [the]Indian offending lies in the fact that he possesses a superabundance of those characteristics which, if found in his detractors, would be regarded as virtues to be extolled and emulated. Unhappily for his peace and safety, the Indian in South Africa is not content to remain the mere hewer of wood and drawer of water. Even despite the disadvantages of his environment, he succeeds in raising himself from lowly beginnings to ‘comparative affluence. Not infrequently he is able to send his sons to our Universities. Here, then, are the real elements of his offending. He presumes beyond his station. Were he but content to furnish unskilled labour, or to earn dividends, for his white fellow-colonist, spending his earnings so that his labour would remain a continuing quantity, not only would his presence be welcome, but no praise would be too high to be lavished upon him. If this be doubted, observe how, in the neighbouring colony of Natal, while the outcry against the better class Indians grows in volume, the Government of the colony steadily declines to abolish the importation of Indian coolie labour.
 Compared with the claims urged on their behalf by responsible English Ministers against the Government of the Transvaal Republic, the demands on this handful of our Indian fellow-subjects established in the Transvaal colony are pathetically modest. In deference to the prejudices of their white fellow-colonists, they do not press for either the municipal or political franchise. With a breadth of view worthy of more sympathetic appreciation, the Indian recognises the difficulties incidental to the Government by a small white minority of a vast native population. He is consequently agreeable to leave the control of the colony to white heads and hands. All that the Indian asks for is to be treated with the respect and consideration due to a civilised, albeit coloured, citizen of the Empire, to be protected from insult, humiliation, and spoliation. He does not claim that a young colony should throw its doors open to an indiscriminate Asiatic influx. He contends, however, that the educational test imposed upon prospective immigrants should be reasonable, and not pointedly directed against Indians. He claims, for instance, that Hindustani and Gujarati should be placed on at least an equal footing with Yiddish. He does, however, demand as an elementary right that lawfully resident Indians should be preserved from differential legislation based upon a presupposition of their inherent inferiority, and even criminality. He concedes the right of municipalities to regulate and restrict the issue of trading licences, and to impose the most stringent sanitary regulations, but
 he asks on what ground should his inability to become the owner of fixed property be perpetuated? Why, for instance, may he not purchase the premises in which his business is conducted ? Tramway and railway regulations excluding him from the use of cars and carriages used by whites, byelaws denying him the use of sidewalks, are surely unworthy of a British colony. Even in the matter of registration, the Indian has, with characteristic willingness to conciliate, proffered a compromise. Since so much importance has been attached by the Transvaal Government to re-registration of its Asiatic population, and in order to prove bona fides, the Indian community have offered to come forward and re-register voluntarily. They are prepared to surrender the titles they hold in exchange for other certificates, and even to give the all-important digit imprints. They further suggest that the Government might subsequently pass a short Act recognising the validity only of such new certificates as have been issued in this way.
 The difference between this suggested compromise and re-registration in terms of the Act cannot but be sufficiently obvious. Voluntary registration would be devoid of the sting of compulsion, and would constitute an act of grace, performed by the Asiatic community in deference to white sentiment, which in course of time might undergo conversion. Compulsory registration is recognised as signifying nothing less than the reduction of British Indians to the status of the Kaffir; as being more than likely of adoption as a precedent for anti-Indian legislation by the neighbouring colonies; and as a probable prelude to compulsory segregation in coloured locations.
 A brief resume, in the form of a table of comparisons between the British Indian position under the Boer Republic and since the annexation, may not be out of place, and cannot but be instructive.

 property.
 Asiatics were liable to be relegated to streets, wards, and locations specially set apart that purpose.
 Whereas Law 3 imposing the above disabilities was virtually inoperative British Indians being protected by His Majesty’s Government.
 Responsible English Ministers claimed for British Indians the equal rights or civilised subjects of the Empire. The British Government virtually  pledged itself to the reinstatement in their just rights of Transvaal British Indians.
 British Indian protests against the Boer law were supported by the Imperial Government, and the insistence by the Republic of its right to legislate indiscriminately against Asiatics  within its borders figured prominently in the causes that led up to the war.
 Generally, while theoretically British Indians were placed under the above disabilities, in practice the law was not strictly enforced.
 This is still the case.
 Asitics, including British indians, are still so liable, and are already theatened with such segregation.
 Since the annexation, and more especially since the grant of responsible Government, British Indians have failed to secure such Imperial protection.
 The British Government has apparently abandoned the  self-same Indians who resided in the colony prior to its annexation to the tyranny of  trade rivals, and of a Government largely composed of legislators who were responsible for the Boer Law 3 of 1885.
 The passive resistance by British Indians to the new Registration Act will, according to the threats of the Colonial Government, result in their expulsion from the colony. The Immigrants’ Restriction Act will confer the necessary powers.
 The restrictions upon the freedom of British Indians have been enforced with the utmost rigour, and the absence of a penalty clause to Law 3 of 1885 has alone saved the Indians from its worst conse- quences.
  In 	conclusion, the temptation to point a moral and to reflect upon the 	inconsistency of pre-war promises with post-war performances will 	readily be appreciated. Apart from the duty of a Government enjoying 	a powerful majority to protect the interests of a wholly 	unrepresented coloured minority, there arises the seductive question 	of the obligation of every member of the Imperial family to 	subordinate merely local interests, not to say predilections or 	prejudices, to the welfare of the Empire at large. It must, however, 	suffice here to point out how far such considerations have 	apparently failed to occupy any place in the policy of the 	Transvaal, which, with a population of barely a quarter of a million 	whites, has not hesitated to endanger Imperial authority and 	prestige by heaping indignity upon indignity upon representatives of 	the three hundred millions of India.
