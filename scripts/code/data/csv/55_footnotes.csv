libtech_68_footnote,"1In his “Letter to Narandas Gandhi”, 13/17-11-1930 (vide “Letter to Narandas Gandhi”, 13/17-11-1930), Gandhiji had explained: “The devotee ‘renounces all undertakings’. This means the devotee will not draw up schemes of future expansion. For example, if a merchant who deals in cloth now has any plans of selling fire-wood as well in the future, or if he, having one shop only, thinks of opening five more shops, that would be arambha (undertaking) on his part, and the devotee will have none of it. This principle is applicable to service of the nation as well. For instance,  a worker in the khadi department today will not take up cow-keeping tomorrow, agriculture the day after and medical aid on the fourth day. He will do his best in whatever has come to him. When I am free from egoism, nothing remains for me to do."

libtech_101_footnote,"3As a 	result of my sending 	abroad weekly bulletins 	of authentic 	news,  regarding 	the Civil 	Disobedience movement, I 	had been served 	with a 	notice to 	quit Bombay. 	As I had declined to comply, I was duly arrested, tried and 	sentenced to three months’ 	simple imprisonment, ‘A’ 	class, and 	sent to Bombay 	female jail at 	Arthur Road. 	There being no ‘A’ 	class accommodation in 	the Debtor’s 	jail, which had been 	temporarily turned 	into a jail 	for female 	political prisoners, I 	was put with 	the ‘C’ 	class prisoners for 	the first two 	nights, after which a 	small kitchen in 	the prison-yard 	was rigged 	up as my cell. 	But as 	nearly all 	the space was 	taken up 	by a large 	row of 	stoves, there was 	no room 	for me to sleep 	inside. This was a 	piece of 	good luck as 	it meant 	I had 	to be allowed 	to wander 	by day 	amongst the 	other prisoners in 	the yard 	and to 	sleep under the 	sky at night, 	while the rest were 	locked up 	in their barrack. It 	may be 	mentioned that 	the ‘C’ class 	political prisoners were 	mostly well educated 	women, used to 	a high standard of 	living, certainly higher 	than the Ashram 	standard. But the Bombay 	Government was 	particularly severe in 	its classification, 	Ba, Mrs. 	Naidu and 	myself being, as 	far as 	I can remember, 	the only 	women given ‘A’ class 	in the 	whole Province. A 	few were given ‘B’ 	class and all the rest ‘C’. The most vital 	difference in 	this classification was 	the food 	supplied.”—Mirabehn"

libtech_485_footnote,"1Mahadev Desai 	explains: ‘‘While the 	above was 	being dictated, 	we had 	a discussion 	about the two readings 	in Tulsidas’s 	verse: Bapu said, ‘‘I 	have heard both 	of them, but I prefer to 	read deha (body).” 	I remarked 	that the Vedantic 	idea that pride is 	the root 	of the 	body did 	not fit in well 	here. Perhaps the 	poet wanted to 	say that 	mercy is 	the root of 	religion and 	pride is 	the root of 	sin. Bapu said, ‘‘If 	we read 	deha,  he 	means that the 	body being the 	root of 	pride is 	an obstacle in 	the way of mercy. But to spend 	ourselves to the 	uttermost in 	service is 	purest mercy. This 	mercy should be 	cherished as 	long as 	we live.” I 	objected that that was 	so but 	it was 	not what the 	poet meant 	to say. 	Again Bapu’s interpretation was 	too subtle for 	the common man, while 	he could 	easily understand that 	pride is 	the root of 	sin. In 	any case, 	the latter 	half of 	the verse 	had nothing 	to do with 	the subject-matter 	of the 	letter.” (The 	Diary of Mahadev 	Desai, Vol. I, 	p. 111)"

When I take my pen intending to hit hard, the picture of the other man stands before my eyes and seems to say: ‘You do not know what I have to say for myself. I too have ideals, however much they may be obscured by my conduct. Judge me as you would yourself.’ I avoid all adjectives of judgement as poison and try in all that I say to be completely objective. This has become a habit, and I do not doubt that in all circumstances it is a healthy one. As regards this particular matter, the thought that after all the man takes his life in his hands weighs my judgment. As for the curious crowd, they, I suppose, find relief from the tyranny of daily circumstances in witnessing facts which show or seem to show that one man at least is able to rise above them.” (The Diary of Mahadev Desai, Vol. I, p. 128)"
