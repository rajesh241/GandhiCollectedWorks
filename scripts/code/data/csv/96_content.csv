     MESSAGE TO KINDERGARTEN SCHOOL   July 	7, 1947  	Are all the Bal Mandirs which are coming up these days worthy of the 	name? This is a question to be considered by all who are interested 	in children’s. education. The country needs good facilities for 	children’s education as much as it needs food, cloth and houses to 	meet its physical needs, for its future depends on the children. [From 	Gujarati]  Bihar 	Pachhi Dilhi, p. 290                  say. 	. . . They Muslim Leaguers backed by officials are out to create 	disturbances…. Another thing causing concern is the presence in 	our province of a large number of Punjabis who openly incite people 	to violence…. suggesting…that top leaders of Red Shirts should 	be done away with.”

  	I have your letter. You must have got my telegram. I hope Bharatlibtech_4_footnotehas regained health. Do not let him wander around.  	I wish you to get engrossed in the Mahila Ashram work. That is a 	major activity among the many activities of Jamnalal. One reason for 	keeping you near by is that you may get immersed in that work. Now 	stop having more children if both of you can exercise self- control 	so that you can look after the two you have and manage the Mahila 	Ashram work. The Ashram does need a worker like you.

 I sympathize with you in your misfortune. But it is ignorance to think that we suffer because of our misfortunes. Misfortune is really a test for us.

 July 7, 1947
 I am able to say from my own experience that the mind also is an important factor in recovering from illness. Fear, anger, impatience and depression aggravate the illness. The more cheerful you are the sooner will  you  recover.  You  should  therefore  try  to
 create such an atmosphere around you. It is a sin against God to fall ill. I have repeatedly pointed this out to Chi. Manudi and made her cry for neglecting her health. But I have noticed during these past two days that she has become a little more sensible. I can only hope that this will not prove temporary.

  	I have your letter. I know I have not been able to write to you 	often. How can it be anger? I am buried in work. Pakistan 	has come into being. But our duty remains the same.

  	I have your letter. My anxiety is that Kishorelalbhai is 	unnecessarily worried and he is leaving the house that he had built 	for 
 himself. I do not mind that he distrusts me. Time will show whether I deserved to be trusted. But let us leave everything to time.
 The Prabhakar episode I think is now closed. I presume that Shankaran’s accusation against Prabhakar was wrong. Prabhakar  flatly denies it. He will never do anything to discredit the Ashram. It is good that you had a talk with Aryanayakum about the dairy. He has not written anything to me. When he does I shall say if there is anything for me to say. I want you to do as much service as you can. What will he do by having only the building? But I cannot say anything. It is not very likely that Anna will continue to live in the Ashram now. Can she (Kamala) live in the Ashram without Anna and undertake to observe the rules of the Ashram? Anna says she can now take care of herself.
 It is a different thing if Ramprasad and Kanta, observing the rules of the Ashram and eating in its mess, can live there. Otherwise I think they have to leave the Ashram.
My stay here is uncertain.

  	What has happened to us today that we are killing one another in the 	name of religion? Can anybody tell me which religious scripture 	teaches this ?  	If you regard yourself as a true Muslim, you should issue a 	statement. You should do this, however, not because I am suggesting 	it. If you yourself feel in your heart that Muslims are committing 	an error in the name of religion, then you may issue whatever 	statement you deem fit. Don’t think that you should issue such a 	statement merely because Gandhi says so. Such a statement will have 	no effect. [From 	Hindi]  Bihar 	Pachhi Dilhi, p. 291

  	I know that even today we are apathetic with regard to this problem, 	because we look upon the practice as a part of dharma. But you 	should strive harder still.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,    NEW DELHI,  July 	7, 1947 
  	Last evening I told you why it was that the prospect of freedom that 	is about to be ours did not fill me with joy. Today I wish to tell 	you how you can turn a bad thing into a good thing. What has 	happened has happened. Nothing is to be gained by brooding over it 	or blaming others. In legal terms it will be only a few days before 	freedom comes into effect. All the parties have arrived  at  an 	agreement and they cannot go back upon their word. Only God an undo 	what man has decided to do.  	The easiest way would be for the Congress and the League to come to 	an understanding without the intervention or the help of the 	Viceroy. In this the League would have to take the first step. I do 	not in the least imply by this that the decision about Pakistan 	should be undone. It should be taken as final, no more open to 	discussion now. But if ten representatives of either party sit 	together in a mud hut and resolve that they will not leave the hut 	till they have arrived at an understanding, then I can say that the 	decision they arrive at will be a thousand times better than the 	present Bill which is before the British Parliament and which 	envisages the setting up of two Dominions. If all the Hindus and 	Muslims who come to see me or write to me do not    
 deceive me, then it is clear that no one is happy with the division of India. They all accept it against their will.
 There is also another method, perhaps as difficult. The army is going to be divided—the army which so far had one single purpose— whatever that purpose might have been. This division of the army certainly fills the heart of every patriot with fear and misgivings. Why are two armies being created? Are they to defend the country against foreign aggression or are they to fight against each other and prove to the world that we are good only for fighting and killing each other?
 I have deliberately painted before you this frightful picture so that you may be warned. The way to escape this is, at any rate in my view, attractive. Will the Hindu masses and all those who have taken part in the struggle for freedom pass the test today? Will they rise up and say that they have no need for an army or at least take a pledge that this army will not be used against their Muslim brethren whether they be living in India or Pakistan. By saying this they will turn their thirty-year-old weakness into strength. Maybe the method I suggest will be considered foolish. However, I must say that God has the power to turn foolishness into wisdom as He has done so many times in history. Those who have set out on the dangerous course  of  dividing the army should pay heed to what I say.

  DISCUSSION WITH DR. SUSHILA NAYAR AND 	ARUNA ASAF ALI 
 NEW DELHI,
 July 8, 1947 God has chastised me severely. I have not known a test more severe than this. What a high standard of morality we had when we
were slaves. We are about to suffer the greatest fall from that lofty
 height in the so-called “priceless freedom” which is approaching. What more is left to be witnessed now? How can I give you any idea of what is going on in my mind? At one time I feel that Bihar is calling me, at another time I hear the call from Noakhali where I succeed to some extent in establishing peace. When I came here from Patna a month ago, I imagined that I would be back at my work in a week. But in the course of this one month so many changes have taken place in the country that a family wouldn’t have seen as many in a generation. I am rotting in Delhi. However, I have not at all given up Noakhali and Bihar work. I am very keen to go to the Punjab also. But I cannot decide where to go. Being in this state of mind, I am following a great thinker who said, “If you cannot see your way, it is better to stay where you are.” So I am here. I cannot go to sevagram at present. I must either accomplish something or die in the attempt. I will think of something new only when I have reached one of these two places. There is no third way. At the moment I do not feel like giving any advice to the Ashram inmates. In all these years I have said much to them, made them do much work. Now every one of them should do what they think best. Ultimately all service is alike in value. The head is perched high in the body and it has great value but the soles, though at the very bottom and in contact with dirt, are not any lower in value. If the sole is pricked by a thorn and one is unable to walk, how much one feels it! Similarly those who have dedicated themselves to service may render it in any manner they like according to their ability and interest. To me every kind of service is valuable.

  INTERVIEW TO DEPUTATION FROM QUETTAlibtech_10_footnote 
 NEW DELHI,
 July 8, 1947 Pandit Malaviyaji had told me specifically that I must visit Uttarkashi once. He himself was to take me along. But that was not to
be. Now it occurred to me that I might visit the holy places which
 Malaviyaji described to me. For I do not at all hope to live for 125 years. Nor do I have that desire. I hope and trust that God will take me away while I am clinging to the aims and principles to which I have been devoted and before anything ugly happens to the country. Then Mirabehn is there. However, the weather there is not favourable at present and so I have postponed my going. Now I will come to the main thing.
 When people learnt that I was going on a pilgrimage to Uttarkashi they imagined that I must be having differences with the leaders and that that was why I was retiring to the Himalayas. Yes, it is true I had difference of opinion with the leaders concerning  the present situation because it seemed to me that the Ramarajya of my dreams was not materializing. But I do not worry because I have developed detachment and I am doing what I have been doing all along and what I feel is true. I do not worry if  anyone  is  not convinced by what I say. I will tell the world from the house-tops what is true. Since the people have agreed to be governed by the leaders, the latter should fulfil their obligations towards the former. It is a rule of democracy that the leaders cannot impose on the people what they do not want I have forebodings that the future of India will be something different from the people’s conception of it.  I  am therefore very much worried.
 Sometimes I wonder whether during the last thirty years I have not taken the country in the wrong direction. However, as I have confessed time and again, our non-violence was not that of the brave. As there was no other alternative we adopted it. Had it not been so we would not have been indulging in perfidious mass murders to solve mutual quarrels among brothers. Our struggle was only ‘passive
 
 resistance.’ Our struggle was based on the non-violence of the weak. Even then a great power had to leave the country. If I alone can adopt non-violence of the brave I can show to the world splendid results it can bring about.

  DISCUSSION WITH V. K. KRISHNA MENONlibtech_11_footnote 
 NEW DELHI,
 July 8, 1947
 We must integrate the Princely States. Otherwise as there has been one Pakistan there will be a thousand Pakistans. We must put the talents of the Princes to good use.
 The problem of Kathiawar is very difficult. When I suggested that Balwantrailibtech_12_footnoteshould be taken into the Working Committee I had done so after careful thought. He has been brought up in a cultured State like Bhavnagar. He renounced everything and worked there. Certainly Dhebar is also capable. But the two differ in talent and temperament.
 Moreover, in the whole of Kathiawar the  Bhavnagar State	is politically the most advanced. I have been associated with it from the time of Sir Prabhashankar Pattanilibtech_13_footnotelibtech_14_footnoteor even earlier, when I joined
 Shamaldas College.libtech_15_footnotelibtech_16_footnoteWhenever I think of Sir Prabhashankar Pattani,
 his image, white-bearded, floats before my eyes. He was also a poet. At that time he composed verses on the spinning-wheel, khadi and swaraj. I do not recall the words but they still ring in my ears. This biggest executive of a princely State began his spinning in a small village of Bhavnagar State. I will not take up your time in dwelling on the details. If I start telling stories about him, there will be no end of them. Let me therefore, come to the main point. His son Anantrai is also a very capable person.libtech_17_footnoteHis services should be utilized. . . .
 
 There are numerous small Stated in Kathiawar. They have been exploiting the people. Balwantrai will be able to tell you their whole history. I should therefore like you to discuss this subject with him. There is no doubt that he is a capable person. Dhebar is a good man, while Balwantrai is “capable”. That is the difference between the two. That is why I made the suggestion to Kripalani. If Kathiawar can be brought into line, it is bound to have an impact on other India States. Moreover Balwantrai has much knowledge of the Indian States. I may say you wouldn’t be far wrong if you called him the Sardar of Kathiawar. He has so much talent that I should like you to utilize his service if you can.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING      BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,    NEW DELHI,  July 	8, 1947 
  	Today I am late by ten minutes. I apologize to you for it. I had so 	much to do and so many people came to see me that I could not free 	myself earlier. Whatever I say these days, I say with great 	deliberation. I first prepare the notes of what I intend to say and 	only then speak. Today I kept writing for a long time and then went 	out to wash myself. The girls came to remind me that it was time but 	I did not hear them. The result has been this delay.  	A friend has today written me a letter in English. He says, “I do 	not know the national language. My language is Tamil. If I write to 	you in Tamil, you will have difficulty in understanding it even if 	you knew a little Tamil. I therefore write in English.”  	As you know I want everyone to write to me in  his  own language. 	The best thing would be for everyone to learn the language of North 	India which is Hindustani—midway between  Hindi  and Urdu. The 	writer has quoted some lines from Bernard Shaw. Bernard Shaw has hit 	out at the English. He display very pungent humour. He says that the 	English are never wrong. They do everything on principle. They fight 	on principle and plunder on principle. They enslave us only on 	principle. They killed their king to uphold democracy. Copying Shaw 	the correspondent makes un of me and 
 says that in the cause of freedom the British are dividing the country into two. But I know the English better than anyone else. They are leaving India because they know that they can derive no economic gain from continuing their rule in India and they have also realized that politically they can no longer keep us in subjection.
 During the first world war Martial Law was introduced in one part of the country. During the second world war Lord Wavell brought the whole of India under Martial Law. But now the English have realized that that kind of thing cannot go on, that keeping India in continuous subjection might be a financial liability. They therefore want to quit. There are still two ways to save the country as I explained to you yesterday. The English still control power. They have a large army here and till that army has left we cannot really say that the British have left. They can still make their presence felt. The British want to dismember the country. Their going should not be a signal to Hyderabad, Travancore and others to declare themselves independent. Where then would be India’s freedom? It has to be admitted that some of the recent events have created doubts in the people’s minds about the intention of the British. But so long as their bad faith has not been proved I shall not judge them. It is of course true that the British have been shirking the right step that should be taken  concerning  the Indian States. But if they leave India in a situation where the various parts fall apart and start fighting against one another there can be no greater blot on their prestige.

  A LETTER 
 July 9, 1947
 I also am a worshipper of art. Isn’t truth also an art? I would say that anybody who makes a distinction between truth and  beauty knows neither.
 He who has taken a vow of service, what need he think? He should reduce himself to a cipher, welcome whatever opportunity of service God Grants him from time to time and acquit himself in it to the best of his ability. It is not for us to think about the results. We should only take care that our motives are not selfish. We are merely instruments in God’s hands. Truly has Narasinha Mehta said: “To say in pride, ‘It is I who am doing this’—that is ignorance, like the dog’s who believes that he is carrying the cart under which he walks.” In that one line of verse the poet has explained man’s dharma.

  	I have thought about the Trustlibtech_19_footnote.  It seems to me we should not 	trouble Mavalankar. Why don’t you invite Saralabehn Ambalal? She 	is a wise lady. But it is for all of you to decide.  	Devdas should not be included. He is already overburdened. I think 	nobody should be included merely because of his name. The 	names of members of the Managing Committee seem all right. If 	Girdharlal Kotak and Maganlal are already there on the  	Committee, they should be consulted before their names are dropped. 	It is all right if they are dropped as per rules.  	If it is possible to devise some method of storing rain water, the 	experiment should certainly be made. If you can get water by sinking 	deep wells, that also is worth trying. It is very necessary to make 	some efforts in this direction.      
 If you decide to grow fruit trees, that also will ultimately be profitable. This whole subject is of importance for a region like Kathiawar.

  DISCUSSION WITH INDONESIAN VISITORS 
 July 9, 1947
 Non-violence is the only thing which can counteract any kind of atom bomb. However, I feel that you have no knowledge of non- violence. Let me ask you: suppose Russia, America and England combined together and attacked you, what kind of violence would you use against them and how? I feel that you could withstand it only if the whole of Asia helped you against it. Even then the European arms would be superior to yours. But Indonesia alone will be able to counteract all the three powers if you show courage, are prepared to die a brave death and adopt non-violence. Yes, it is true that everyone will be sacrificed. But no one will be able to subjugate you. The non- violence which we practised was not that of the brave. It was passive resistance. If we could have practised non-violence of the brave there wouldn’t have been this fratricidal carnage which is taking place now. Spiritual courage is more important than physical courage. If, therefore, not only India but the whole of Asia practised non-violence of the brave. Asia would have a different status. Unluckily the wave of violence has spread all over India. I must confess that all the hopes I have pinned on India will be belied if we are not able to practise non- violence of the brave. I hope at least that God will not make me a witness to it.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_20_footnote       BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,      NEW DELHI,  July 	9, 1947 
  	You will ask me why I went to see the Viceroylibtech_21_footnotetoday. Freedom is not yet ours. There is only 	hostility. They stop the trams as they like, they stab and loot. 	Freedom is like the sun but it does not seem to me that it is 	coming. The Viceroy calls me his friend. How can I be a friend of 	his? I am a friend of the sweepers, of the poor.  	The writer of the letter I spokelibtech_22_footnoteof yesterday reminds me that in 1940 I had said that 	I found violence in the air. He asks if I found violence in the air 	then, what do I find now? He has the right to ask. It cannot be said 	that things are going well in India. People are stopping trains, 	indulging in arson and plunder and stabbings. This is anarchy. 	People embezzle funds and adopt improper methods to make money. 	Others quietly part with money. There is untruth, violence, hatred 	and distrust in the air.  	Against this background comes the declaration of June 3. Hindus, 	Muslims and Sikhs have agreed to see India dismembered. Then came 	reports in newspapers of thefts, looting,  arson and murders. The 	correspondent sarcastically asks me if this is my idea of love. He 	says I have been a votary of truth and asks where that truth is now. 	Now the only question is, who is higher and who is lower? Where is 	the tolerance I have been talking about? If it is not there, who is 	responsible for it? Is it the Viceroy or is it someone else?  	My answer is that it is true that there is a stench every- where. I 	say I am responsible for it. For thirty years I have been telling 	the country to follow truth and non-violence. If my advice had been 	heeded, the result would have been different. You judge the tree by      
 the fruit. If the English go, does it mean that law and order should also go with them? Even people who talked that language of satyagraha had harboured thoughts of violence and intended at the very first opportunity to take to arms. The swaraj I had dreamed of is still a long way away. I do not wish to be a witness to this internecine strife. I do not wish to shed tears over what has happened in Multan, Rawalpindi, Garhmukteshwar, Bihar and Bengal, for I am a soldier. Nor do I wish to die. Neither the Hindus, nor the Muslim, nor the Sikhs can ensure their survival through the madness that has overtaken them. Money can be earned by the sword but no merit. The only way is for us even now to take to the path of non-violence. Therein alone lies our good and that of the world. Humanity demands that  the  British should bring about reconciliation between the two parties, between the two armies. I hope that the days that are left will be enough to achieve this. Then there is the question of the States. Fifteenth of August is the last day. There is still time. If reconciliation cannot be effected before that date, then I fear it will be too late. The British are stronger than we. They have immense military strength. Those who imagine that the British are finished as a military power are mistaken.

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 
 
 
 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 
 
NEW DELHI,
 July 10, 1947
  	I am often asked, now that Pakistan has been conceded, what is the 	duty of those of us who are in the Indian Union? I have spoken on 	this question many times but it comes up again and again. One 	possibility is that India and Pakistan will be enemies. The Muslim 	League often says that Hindus and especially the caste Hindus are 	its enemies. Must then the Hindus also consider the Muslims their 	enemies? At least that is not my way. And in my old age I cannot 	give up my way. My humanity tells me that the whole world is my 	friend. Cutting each other’s throats will not bring good to 	anyone. Friendship does not mean appeasement. A friend does not seek 	to appease another friend. If harsh words have to be said, they must 	be said. I have been asked, if I am against appeasement, what else 	have I been doing? When in 1944 I trudged my way in the sun on 	eighteen successive days to the Qaid-e-Azam’s house I was doing my 	duty. I did not seek to appease the Qaid-e-Azam. Had he accepted 	what I went to offer him all this blood that has now been shed would 	never have been shed. And all this poison would not have been 	spread. Also there would have been no third power in India and even 	after the formation of Pakistan, India would have been one. My talks 	with Mr. Jinnah were friendly. Appeasement today has a bad  	connotation. When Germany and England were hostile to each other, 	Chamberlain, who was the Prime Minister at the time, had sought to 	appease Hitler. It is not my view but that of many Englishmen that, 	had Chamberlain not chosen the path of appeasement, history would 	have been different. But since I do not consider anyone my  	adversary  why should I go out to appease anyone?  	Will the temples and the Gurudwaras in Pakistan be destroyed? My 	feeling is that they will not be. Will they stop the Hindus from 	going to the temples? I do not think that this is the meaning of 	Pakistan. Has not Daulatana Saheb said only today that none but 	enemies of Islam would say that Hindus and Sikhs could not follow 	their faith in Pakistan. If the Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan really 	get the same justice as the Muslims then I have not the least doubt 	that Islamic democracy is a lofty thing. If they consider all 	mankind as 
 having descended from Adam, how can they stop the followers of other religions from worshipping God in their own different ways. I think that Daulatana Saheb means what he says. I shall ask the Hindus of the Punjab and N. W. F. P. not to flee from their homes in fright. The Golden Temple is in Amritsar but what will happen to Nankana Saheblibtech_36_footnotelibtech_37_footnotefor which the Sikhs have made such sacrifices? It has to remain in Pakistan. There are so many Hindu temples in Hyderabad. I do not say that Hyderabad will become a part of Pakistan. Ninety-five per cent of the population there is Hindu. If all those Hindus are included in Pakistan, what will be the meaning of Pakistan? The great Jama Masjid will be in the Union. Shall we forbid the Muslims to say namaaz there? Then there is the Taj Mahal in Agra. And a Muslim University in Aligarh. Will Muslim students be stopped from studying there? Is there a place that does not have both mosques and temples? I find both wherever I go. Why then do the Hindus from the Punjab, Sind and N. W. F. P. want to flee to India? They should be brave. We have no use for the bravery that consists in burning down houses and killing innocent children. It is not bravery. It is devilry.
 But if people do leave their houses in Sind and other places and come to India, must we drive them out? If we do that, how can we call ourselves Indians? With what face can we shout Jai Hind? For what had Netaji fought? We are all Indians whether living in Delhi or Gujarat. They will be our guests. We shall welcome them saying that India is their country as much as Pakistan. If Nationalist Muslims also have to leave Pakistan we shall welcome them here. As Indians we all have the same status.
 There are still thirty-five days to August 15. Let us cease to be beasts and become men. We have all been put to the test and that includes the British. I have just received a telegram from Noakhali saying that now that Pakistan has come into being the Hindus who had suffered there are not likely to get any compensation. Why should they not get compensation? With Pakistan established it is all the more the duty of the Government there to protect the Hindus. The telegram also says that those who have committed murders and who are at present in prison are likely to be freed. I hope this will not be. The Pakistanis must demonstrate that the Hindus living in Pakistan will not be harmed in any way. Then we shall have reason to celebrate 15th of
 
 August as Independence Day. But if this does not happen, this independence is not for me nor, I am sure will it be for you. A lot can happen in these thirty-five days.

Now if you do not come here 	before the 15th of August, you will repent.”  	I admit that if I do not go to Noakhali before August 15, I shall 	repent. Why am I in Delhi? I ought to be either in Bihar  or  in 	Noakhali. I am restless here. I was not so in Noakhali. I walked 	long distances every day, visited ever new villages and met an 	immense number of people both Hindus and Muslims. I did some work in 	Noakhali, also in Bihar. There is a fire raging inside me. That fire 	will not rage after I go to Noakhali. I ask you to pray that God may 	quickly send me to Noakhali.  	I have not forgotten my pledge to do or die. From Noakhali I went to 	Bihar, for whereas in Noakhali only a few hundred people had died, 	in Bihar thousands were killed. So for me Noakhali and Bihar were 	alike. From there Jawaharlal summoned me here. Kripalani also sent 	me a wire calling me here, but what have I achieved here? Of course 	many people retort, “What could I achieve in Noakhali? If there is 	a settlement concerning the whole of India, there will automatically 	be a settlement concerning Noakhali.” But I proceed the other way. 	I had learnt when still a child the formula, “As in the microcosm 	so in the macrocosm.” My untutored and rustic mother also taught 	me to begin with myself and not to bother about the world. There is 	God to look after the world. I must therefore keep the pledge I made 	in Noakhali. [From 	Hindi]  Prarthana 	Pravachan–I, pp. 	237-8

  A LETTER 
 July 12, 1947
 He who has conquered anger has achieved a great victory in life.  I myself am not free from it. But I am ceaselessly striving and have made progress. The final result can be judged only after my death. Chi. Manudi’s health is deteriorating from day to day. Though I sometimes feel irritated by her carelessness in regard to it, I must admit that none from among the countless girls who came and worked with me acquitted herself as well as this girl of sixteen or seventeen did both physically and mentally in doing whatever work I assigned to her in Noakhali and Bihar. And even at the age of thirteen, she had rendered similar service to Ba. I have admired her ever since then. All this has a bearing on my reply to the question whether I have conquered anger. She has ruined her health in serving me, but if only she would give me co-operation, take proper rest, be careful about her diet and remain cheerful, I could help her to regain her health in a month and she would feel better than she ever did. But I have to remind her again and again. Though running a temperature, she was rolling khakharas for me yesterday. This made me angry. If I had scolded her, she would have started crying and the temperature would have risen still higher, instead of coming down. This anger bespeaks weakness both of body and mind. When the mind is full of agony, what can we expect but physical weakness? But I am confident that in the end I shall overcome this anger too.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,      NEW DELHI,  July 	12, 1947 
  	Today I have received a letter from a friend which says: “What is 	happening in the country today is very bad. People who went to jail 	during the satyagraha movement think they have done something  very 	big which should entitle them to be Prime Minister or Minister or 	Parliamentary Secretary or Governor of some province. They think 	they should have a motorcar. I have also been to prison twice and 	once I was with you in Yeravda. But I have remained a beggar and no 	one has ever bothered about me!”  	If someone has been to jail, has he done a favour to India? If this 	sort of mentality persists, I fear the Congress will perish. Those 	who are in the Congress should not even dream of such things. 	Arguing thus a Congressman may say that, since he has been to jail, 	his son should be married to the best girl in India or that his 	daughter should be married to the best young man in India. 	Jawaharlal has not become the Vice- President or the Prime Minister 	because he has been to jail. If he does not get his salary, he will 	not starve. Rajendra Babu might have become the Chief Justice of 	Patna High Court but he voluntarily gave up practice and chose to 	live the life of a fakir. Rajaji also has not become a minister by 	virtue of his jail-going. If is not my contention that they are all 
 angels. They are men like us and all men make mistakes. And how many of us can be absorbed in Government offices? It is an unworthy thought and should be given up. We must never think that we should get some reward for having gone to jail. The reward of doing one’s duty lies in the duty done.
 I have been asked: “Whereas in Pakistan Mr. Jinnah has been made Governor-General, here in India it is the Viceroy who has been made Governor-General. Why should this be so? The battle  for India’s freedom was fought by the Congress. The Muslim League has had no part in it. Whenever the Congress resorted to civil disobedience or satyagraha the League refused to co-operate. Even so the Congress cannot get an Indian as Governor-General. This is not just. This will mean that we shall be safe only if we kowtow to the British or we shall die.” I shall say that under the scheme that will come into effect on August 15, it does not matter whether the Governor-General is an Englishman, a Frenchman or a Dutchman, whether he is a brown- skinned Indian or a White or a Negro. If I had my way a Harijan girl would be the Governor-General. So if Lord Mountbatten becomes the Governor-General he will still be a servant of India. You will say this is the kind of talk to pacify children. Mountbatten, who is a scion of a Royal family, will not be anybody’s servant. But I am not deceiving you. I do not expect any reward from Lord Mountbatten. So long I have been fighting against him. Maybe you will say that the Congress leaders have been deceived by him. Do you mean to say that Jawaharlal, Sardar and Rajaji are so softbrained as to be taken in? True, as I have been saying what I had wanted has not come to pass. But Mountbatten will be Governor-General because we want him. If we did not want him he would not hold that office. But Mr. Jinnah may have chosen to be Governor-General in order to show off. We should not be jealous and we should not be angry. He wants to show to the world what Islam is. Let us see whether he makes of himself a master or a servant. If even a single Sindhi flees, then the responsibility for it will rest on the Governor-General of Pakistan. He will have to be just to all, like Abubaker or Omar, or Ali. I do not say they were all non-violent. But I have in mind their bravery and their chivalry. I understand from the newspapers that originally the idea had been for India and Pakistan to have one Governor-General in common. But Mr. Jinnah later went back on his word. Who was then to prevent him from becoming the Governor-General of Pakistan? In
 my view he did not do the right thing. When he had once agreed he should have accepted Lord Mountbatten as Governor-General and later if something had gone wrong he could have removed him. Now Islam is to be tested through Mr. Jinnah. He is assuming the Governor-Generalship of Pakistan with the whole world as witness. The world will now wait to see what special virtues Pakistan displays under him. The Congress has always been fighting against the British. Jawaharlal is a simple-hearted man. But the Sardar is a fighter. He used to quarrel with me because I trusted the British. When he himself has been caught up in their wiles, what can you or I hope to do? When he agrees that the Viceroy should be the first Governor-General of India, why should we object? We shall see whether he will serve India as Governor-General or betray her. It will be a new experience. There is wisdom in this and we have nothing to lose. After all we accepted Dominion Status on the advice of the Viceroy. He is an Admiral and a great warrior. Let us have him and if he does not come up to our expectations we can always fight with him.
 When I went to see the Viceroy he confided in me that the young man to whom Princess Elizabeth had been betrothed was like a son to him and he hoped that I would write a few words of blessings to him. So when the Viceroy’s daughterlibtech_47_footnotelibtech_48_footnotecame to see me two days ago I gave her a letter of congratulation addressed to the couple. She is such a sweet girl. At the prayer I offered her a chair but she declined the offer and sat down with us on the duree . And today I learnt from Rajkumari Amrit Kaur that the young Princess who has got engaged to be married will be the future queen of England because the king has no son. The Viceroy too has no son. Anyway if the Viceroy had been a bad man I wouldn’t have been so free with my blessings. I do not consider him a bad man. If Jawaharlal or Sardar Patel had become Governor-General in his place it would have been a dangerous thing. Besides, the Governor-General wields no effective power. He will have to act on the advice of Jawaharlal and his cabinet. He will only be a figurehead.
 But we have got into the way of thinking that Lord Mountbatten has great status and the English are capable only of devilry. Lord Mountbatten therefore will have to prove his honesty and love of justice and I am sure that he has come to India to do only justice.
 
 Many Muslims come to see me these days. They too are nervous about Pakistan. One can understand Christians, Parsis and other non- Muslims feeling uneasy, but why Muslims? They say they are treated as Quislings, that they will receive even worse treatment than the Hindus in Pakistan and after full power has been  transferred  to Pakistan their association with the Congress will be considered a crime according to the tenets of Shariyat. I do not agree that this is the meaning of Islam. What crime was committed by the Congress having Muslims within its fold? Do muslims by associating with the Congress become criminals? Do they not say Kalma or perform the namaaz? Has Islam changed so much since the time of the Ali Brothers? How can nationalist Muslims be called Quislings? I do hope  that  Mr.  Jinnah, while he protects the non-Muslim minorities in Pakistan, will also at the same time accord protection to these Muslims.

  SOCIALISMlibtech_49_footnote 
 Truth and ahimsa must come alive in socialism. This can only be possible when there is a living faith in God. Mere mechanical adherence to truth and ahimsa is likely to break down at the critical moment. Hence have I said that truth is God.
 This God is a living Force. Our life is of that Force. That Force resides in the body, but is not the body. He who denies the existence of that great Force denies to himself access to its inexhaustible power and thus remains impotent. He is like a rudderless ship which, tossed about here and there, perishes without making any headway. Many find themselves in this plight. The socialism of such people does not reach anywhere, what to say of the millions.
 If such be the case, why is there no socialist who believes in God? If there are such socialists why have they not made any  progress? Also there have been many believing in God; why is it they have not succeeded in bringing socialism?
 There is no effective answer to this. Nevertheless, it is possible to say that it has perhaps never occurred to a believing socialist that there is any connection between his socialism and his belief in God.
 
 Equally, men of God perhaps never felt any need for socialism. Superstitions have flourished in the world in spite of godly men and women. In Hinduism which believes in God, untouchability has, till of late, held undoubted sway.
 The nature of this Divine Force and its inexhaustible power have been matters of incessant quest.
 My claim is that is the pursuit of that quest lies the discovery of satyagraha. It is not, however, claimed that all the laws of satyagraha have already been formulated. I cannot say either that I myself know all the laws. This I do assert that every worthy object can be achieved through satyagraha. It is the highest and the most potent means, the most effective weapon. I am convinced that socialism will not be reached by any other means.
 Satyagraha can rid society of all evils, political, economic and moral.

  IN DEFENCEOFTHE OLDlibtech_50_footnote 
 The correspondent, from whose letter I had quote the other day, writes:
 I was in full agreement with the opinion you had expressed on the views set forth in a letter I wrote eleven years ago. Nevertheless, I lacked the courage to act up to them. I often say to myself, why go into the charcoal pit at all? Though you have placed before the world your conception of the ideal man with a view to promoting social good, nevertheless it seems to me that that good would be better served by keeping intact the restraints handed down by men of experience. It is true that awareness of distinction between man and woman should be removed. The feeling that woman is property should also go. But in propagating these tenets the harm that has been done by the communist Party is terrible. Kishorelalbhai objects even to sitting on the same mat with women. This perhaps only shows his orthodoxy. Nevertheless, the idea is not to be lightly set aside. We must not forget what the Gitalibtech_51_footnotesays: that whatever
 
 great men do, common people follow. Therefore, it seems to me that it is wisdom for those who have reached a higher state to act in accordance with the capacity of those many who belong to a lower state and this they will do in order to avoid the risk of weaker people resorting to thoughtless imitation. I admit, however, one apt argument in defence of your position, viz., that if there was nobody to demonstrate the feasibility of the higher state, society would cease to have faith in it. Therefore must be someone to demonstrate it. As to this all I can say is that every great person must be left to choose his behaviour after due appreciation of the pros can cons.
I like the above criticism. Everyone should learn to know his
 own weakness. He who, knowing his own weakness, imitates the strong, is bound to fail. Hence have I contended that everyone  should construct his own restraints.
 I do not think that Kishorelal refuses to sit on the same mat with a woman. I should be surprised if that were so. I could not appreciate such taboo. I have never known him to advocate it.
 I only see ignorance in likening a woman to a charcoal pit. It is an insult to both man and woman. May not a son sit beside his mother or a man share the same bench in a train with his sister. If he gets sexually excited in such company he is surely to be pitied.
 Although I grant that for the sake of social good much must be given up, I nevertheless feel that there is room for discrimination. There are nudist groups in Europe. I was asked to join one but I refused. I said that until it could be shown that there was a certain measure of purity in the individual, nudity was not desirable. This I said although I believe that theoretically speaking there is nothing harmful in both the sexes going about completely naked. Such was the case with Adam and Eve in their innocence. But immediately they became conscious of their nakedness, they covered themselves and fell from Paradise. We are in that fallen state. If we forget it, we shall harm ourselves. I consider this an instance of observing conditions for the sake of social good.
 It was in the interest of social good that pressure was brought to bear on me to give up insistence on the eradication of untouchability. Marriage of nine-year-old girls was defended in the name of social good. So was prohibition against crossing the seas. Such instances can be multiplied. Every custom has to be examined on its own merits.
 Restraints must not be such as to perpetuate differentia- tion between men and women. We must remember that in most of our
 daily transactions such differentiation has no place. Strictly speaking making such a distinction is relevant only on the occasion when one is overcome by sexual desire. Men and women who are overcome by this desire at all hours of the day show sickness of mind and cannot be instrumental in promoting social good. This is not the normal state of man. If the millions in villages were prey to such desire all day long they would be no good for any useful work.

 I have not the least doubt in my mind that food control must go now—as soon as practicable. If a few Indians die in consequence, I will shed no tears. But the idea that we should share the available food equally cannot be spread through laws, and even if legislation were to succeed in doing so, I would not praise it. On the contrary, I would not hesitate to charge it with having done violence to the human spirit.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,      NEW DELHI,  July 	13, 1947 
  	There have already been two occasions when I was late for prayer. It 	has happened again today. I did my best to be here before 7 o’clock 	but I did not succeed. I had gone to see the Viceroy. Since I am 	vegetating here I have to be doing something. So many things are 	happening here and a person like me has to be saying something or 	other. I went to the Viceroy at four expecting to be free early. But 	there were various other people there and the result was I got 	delayed. However, I am very happy to observe that the prayer  	started punctually.  	There has been a Press conference addressed by Mr. Jinnah. A report 	of it has reached me. He holds out the assurance that the minorities 	in Pakistan will not be put to any hardship. They shall be accorded 	the same treatment as Muslims. The Hindus will be free to visit 	their temples and the Sikhs their Gurudwaras.  	Of course, I cannot take anyone’s word at face value. Even today 	in Pakistan carnage and arson are rampant. This is happening in the 	Indian Union too. Who is doing this? Is it only the Muslims or are 	Hindus too responsible for it? I am flooded with letters of all 	kinds. People ask why they cannot live in peace. I ask Mr. Jinnah 	when his assurance will be put into practice. Will it be effective 	only  after August 15? Sind will be a part of Pakistan. The Muslim 	League has the most influence there. Mr. Jinnah has become the 	Governor- General. Still there is a king in England and so long as 	he is there we are in some way still connected with him through the 	Governor- General and the Governor-General still remains responsible 	to the king. Mr Jinnah also remains the President of the League. 	This further strengthens his status. He should act with justice. Why 	should Sindhis be running away from Sind? If even a single Sindhi 	leaves Sind it will be a matter of shame to Mr. Jinnah as 	Governor-General. The proof of a man’s word is his action.  	I do not know what has happened or not happened in U. P. But the 	Muslims of U. P. are walking in fear. They do not know whether they 	can continue to live there or not. But why can’t they live there, 	I 
 ask? I ask U. P. and Bihar as I ask Mr. Jinnah: Can Muslims live in those provinces or not?
 We have at last rid ourselves of the British. There was a time when they made us fight against each other. That time is now no more.
 The Muslims of U. P. have a grouse over the proportion of Government jobs to be given to them. They say that whereas up to now they held between 60 and 70 p. c. of Government posts, now it is proposed that they should have only 14 p. c. according to their population ratio. I cannot share this complaint. When all is said and done, how many of us can have Government jobs? What good can they do to us? And then we take up jobs in order to serve the public, not merely to further our own interest. If what has been the practice so far is continued it will not be just. If the doctors and lawyers have been fleecing the population till now, does it mean that they should continue to do so? If I am asked by someone whether the percentage of jobs so far allotted to them will continue, I can ask in turn who gave them that percentage and how? The Congress fought against the Government and the Government bribed those who fought the Congress. Now the Government will be ours. Why should the Government be obliged to bribe anyone? It is now imperative for us to abolish untouchability. Would the Government have had  the courage to open the temples through legislation? When I see that in Madras one temple after another is opening its doors to Harijans, it makes me happy. This is how dharma can be safeguarded. The same applies to Christians and Parsis. Our Government must be dedicated to raising the status of those who are downtrodden. If it does something for the Harijans, why should the Brahmins complain? Yes, if someone suggests that the Brahmins should be beaten and humiliated, then I shall say ‘no, that is bad’.
 If I can say anything on behalf of Muslims or the Indian Union, it is only this, that everyone should have justice. If this is ensured then there will be nothing more left to say and the pain of partition will have been forgotten.
 People say that the work of partition is finished, that the army has been divided, the navy has been divided. I say we have been weakened. Foreigners will say India has no navy. They will in their own interest align themselves with one or the other Dominion and thus this division of the army will become a cause of civil war. But I hope
 that Pakistan and India will be friends, that they will be just to their minorities.
 Even if wehave not learnt the lesson of ahimsa, we should at least from our thirty years of experience learn the lesson that we shall never again become slaves irrespective of whether we achieve this through violence or non-violence. I do not say that it should be only through non-violence. I have been saying this since I was in Bihar. People ask for guns and swords. I say, why do you want these weapons? Proclaim that you will never bow down. I said the same in Noakhali. If we can show that we have learnt this lesson after thirty years of experience, it will not matter whether people are violent or non-violent. If they come and ask me, I shall still say that they must follow only non-violence. If a single individual has to defy the world he can do so only through non-violence. Where there is non-violence, there is God. The sword breaks before it.

  	I have your letter. You cannot leave the Ashram in this manner.

He as- sures me that he has been 	guilty of no lapse. He has enter- tained no impure thoughts We 	should not, therefore, take any extreme step merely on suspicion. 	When the time to wind up the Ashram comes, I myself will give the 	call. There is room for much purification in us all. All vows have 	the same importance. Violation of any one of them amounts to 	violation of all. Relations of men and women attract our attention 	immediately. Moreover, we condemn such relations in a great many 	cases, but we ought not to assert positively that they really 	deserve our condemnation. All depends on the purity or otherwise of 	the mind. If my mind becomes affected by the sight of a woman’s 	picture, I have committed adultery. But though I used to sleep with  	     by my side,  	my mind remained unaffected and so I could claim that I committed no 	immoral act. That my claim might not be accepted by  others would be 	a different matter. That I should give up such practice if my 	co-workers cannot put up with it is also another issue. The point I 	am making is that we ought not to pass judgment on any action merely 	on the basis of suspicion. Though  all the vows are of equal 	importance, some of them may be easier to observe than others. The 	vow of ahimsa seems to me the most difficult of all. Any thoughtless 	remark constitutes violence. Getting angry with anybody is violence. 	You can think of many other similar instances and calm yourself. You 	will find that, though you have risen high, you have still further 	to climb. Be calm and continue the watch.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a copy of the Gujarati: C. W. 822.

 India has been partitioned. But the division of the army has greatly affected me. Do not these people realize that if either India or Pakistan is invaded by a foreign power, it is equally the duty of both to resist the aggression? How humiliating will it be for us if Pakistan and India cannot remain united even in such a crisis? If the army is divided, a situation will arise when both the armies will start fighting one another, and that situation will be very difficult to control. On the whole it is harmful to both the countries. And that is why I am requesting…libtech_62_footnoteto give a serious thought to this question. Even if we have not learnt non-violence in the last thirty years, we certainly will have realized that we will not be slaves to any third power, let alone the British. But I feel that… anything I say is not acceptable to people today. That is why I do not think too deeply over anything. I request these people to allow me to return to Bihar and then Noakhali. But the Viceroy and Jawaharal do not agree. And I do not want to go if it hurts their feelings.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,      NEW DELHI,  July 	14, 1947 
  	It is said that my speeches these days are such as to generate a 	feeling of pessimism. Indeed I am advised by some not to speak at 	all. It reminds me of a story about a painter. He placed a paint- 	ing on display with a notice that critics might mark the sport where 	they found the painting faulty. The result was that the painting was 	soon reduced to a blur of colours. The painter had wanted to show 	that it was not possible to please everyone and he was satisfied 	that he had created a good painting. I am in a similar situation. I 	never speak merely for the sake of speaking. I speak because I feel 	that I have a message to deliver.  	It is true that today there are differences between me and my 	closest colleagues. I do not approve of certain things that they 	have done or are doing. But it is not possible for me while I am in 	Delhi not to express my views on the present situation. What is at 	the root of these differences? If you go into it you will find that 	there is only one thing at the root of it. Non-violence is a creed 	with me while it has never been so with the Congress. The Congress 	accepted non-violence only as a policy—a policy has the status of 	a creed only so long as it is pursued. The congress has a perfect 	right to change its policy the moment it feels that it is no longer 	necessary to pursue it. But it is different with a creed. It remains 	for ever and it cannot be changed.  	In the Congress constitution non-violence is still the policy but in 	practice Congressmen have changed it. Legal pundits may well comment 	on it but you and I cannot do so nor should we. Why should 	Congressmen not change their policy? Besides, the constitution of 	the Congress says ‘peaceful’ and not ‘non-violence’.  	In 1934, at the Bombay Congress, I tried my best to have the term 	‘peaceful’ replaced by the term ‘non-violence’. But I was 	unsuccessful. Therefore anyone can, it he chooses, say that 	‘peaceful’ means ‘something little less than non-violent’. 	In my view there is no difference between the two. But my view is 	neither here nor there. It is the experts who must decide. You and I 	must only understand that the practice of Congress today is not in 	the least non-violent. If non- 
 violence had been the creed of the Congress, how would it be possible for it to support the army as it is doing today? If the army is so disposed it can crush the people and establish a militray regime. Shall  I give up the hope altoge-ther that people will ever listen to me? And if they will not listen to me, what harm does it do if I speak out? Why should they seek to stop me?
 I have repeatedly made it clear that the struggle that has been waged over the last thirty years was not a non-violent struggle. It was only passive resistance and such resistance is a weapon of the weak. It is not that people who use this weapon do not want to use the weapon of non-violence. It is simply that they do not know how to use it. If we had the courage for the battle of non- violence we would today be presenting to the world an entierely different picture of free India. But today we can show only a dismembered country where brother fights brother and no one can trust another. We are not able to attend to feeding and clothing the people and have nothing to offer those impoverished millions who can see God only in the form of bread and who have no interest in this unending violence.

 How can I today speak of tomorrow? Why should we, then, worry where I shall be and what I shall be doing next month? Why, we don’t even know what is going to happen the very next moment. Rama might take me away even while I am writing this letter. Without, therefore, worrying about the future, we should only think how best to do the duty at hand. You should stay on there and finish the Course in Nai Talim. Only afterwards should you think about what to do next. Otherwise, it will be with you as it was with Sheikhchalli in the story : the ghee will be spilt before it reaches hoem. You will not be able to finish the course in Nai Talim and will be left nowhere. One must undertake a task only after careful thinking and, having undertaken it, one must cling to it till death.

 If there is enmity between Hindus and Muslims today the masses are not to blame. Opportunists are to blame. Those who have any energy should devote themselves to the uplift of the country without harbouring any prejudices. If there is one great fault in us it is that we cannot refrain from criticizing individuals in public and our public is not educated enough to analyse and judge a speaker. Everyone has virtues and vices. Today when swaraj is about to come, the handful of scholars that we have should make available to the masses whatever they have. Our leaders are almost all becoming old. The scholars should devote themselves to training of the younger generation so that they can carry on our heritage. Mere criticism is not going to help anyone.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,     NEW DELHI,  July 	15, 1947 
  	The other day I spoke of the temples in Tamil  Nadu and Malabar that 	had been thrown open to Harijan and I especially mentioned the 	Rameswaram temple. It is a huge temple and there is a lot of 	superstition concerning it. Some thought that the entry of Harijans 	would pollute the temple. I have received a letter today complaining 	that I had not mentioned the Tirupati temple in Andhra    
 Desh which is also a great and acient temple. The correspondent asks me to rectify the omission and thus give satisfaction to the people of Andhra. I know the glory of this temple but I make no difference between Tamil Nadu and Andhra. Today the atmosphere is such that everyone wants separation.
 Some friends from Bengal have been to see me. They say that with the division of Bengal Hindus in East Bengal are haunted by the fear that the Hindus of West Bengal will forget them. It that happens I shall be pained. It will be very bad if Hindus thus forget Hindus and Muslims forget Muslims. Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Christians all are Indians. Religion is a private matter. If I wish to worship God, what power on earth can stop me from doing so? But If Mussalmans, Parsis, Hindus and Christians all consider themselves separate, what is left of India? I admit that is was hardly necessary to divide Bengal. I have lived among Bengali Muslims. I have walked with them in Noakhali. I found only love in their hearts. Why should Hindus have harboured fear of Muslims? The madness that had seized them would not have lasted for ever. In my view no harm will come to the Hindus of East Bengal. But many things have happened which we did not want to happen. Bengal has been partitioned. And India and Pakistan are separate countries. But we should proceed forward from what has happened and later put it right. Hindus and Muslims of East and West Bengal have always lived together and speak the same language. It the Hindus of East Bengal treat the Muslims there as friends, would the Muslims still want to kill them? When not a single Hindu considers Muslims his enemies, all will be friends.
 They also asked me if the Bengal  Provincial  Congress Committee will be dissolved since it too has been divided into two. In my view the division of Bengal does not apply to the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee. It should continue in its present form. It is outside Government laws. If it divides itself, then I will say that West Bengal has broken faith. The structure of the Congress today is such that at the very bottom there are village Congress Committees, Mandal Congress Committees, District Congress Committees, then Provincial and at the very top the All-India Congress Committee. Thus there will be Congress Committees in East Bengal as well as in West Bengal. Both will then constitute the B.P.C.C. The Congress belongs to all, to Muslims, Christians, Parsis and others. It is not going to change its character in the days to come. The Bengali friends also wonder whether East Bengal has been so impoverished that it must
 have even its ministers from West Bengal. But they should welcome this. For this will make for cohesion between East and West Bengal. East Bengal no doubt has an overwhelming majority of Muslims. But why should we assume that all Muslims are bad? So many Muslims were slaughtered in Bihar and yet I can say that the millions of Hindus in Bihar are not bad. It is wrong to condemn the whole community for the fault of a few individuals. It only goes to show that  we ourselves are not clean, that we are cowards, that we have not the courage of non-violence, for the courage of non-violence is the courage to die, never the courage to kill. There are vast armies in the world but considering the population of the world, they are only a handful. But we have got into the way of never being able to see straight. Whenever there is some incident somewhere we at once ask for the army to be sent. In Noakhali, Bihar, the Punjab and the N.W.F.P., wherever there were riots there was only one demand : that the army be sent for their protection. Why should people who ought to be brave want this?

             DEAR 	FRIEND,   LETTER TO LORD MOUNTBATTEN   BHANGI 	 COLONY, 	NEW DELHI,  July 	16, 1947 
  	I had a long talk with Panditji about Kashmir. He is firmly of 	opinion that I should go in any case, not minding it Qaid-e-Azam 	Jinnah or his deputy goes after my visit. He thinks, and I agree, 	that if now my visit is postponed, it will disappoint many persons 	in Kashmir. That I may not be allowed to see Sheikh Abdulla Saheb 	should not affect the Contemplated visit one way or the other. In 	the circumstances, I suggest that you should telegraph to the 	Maharaja Saheb that as my visit would not mean any speeches or 	public meetings, it shold not cause any embarrassment to the State 	and that I should go to Kashmir at the earliest possible moment.  	As I have said to you my suggestion is subject to your wish not to 	interfere with Panditji’s wishes in the matter. If, for any 	reason, you wish otherwise, I would not go. 
 If I go, I would go as a private visitor. Hence I would not think of putting the Maharaja Saheb to any trouble on my account. Friends would make arrangements for my stay.
 Finally, I should add that if, for any reason, I do not go to Kashmir, most probably Panditji would want to go for two or three days though he would prefer my going.libtech_74_footnote

  	I have your letter. I have the impression that I have already 	written to you something in reply to your criticism of my 	experiment.  	I am doing nothing just now. There has been no change at all in my 	conviction up to now. On the contrary, it is deepening with the 	passage of time. That is, I believe that even if only one 	brahmachari of my conception comes into being, the world will 	be redeemed. But 
 the task is an extremely difficult one. Any progress in that direction will of course be a gain. On the other hand, there is no doubt that if the assumption is erroneous, much harm can come of it. Just now there is only one aspect of the question that presents itself to me. That is, that the difference of opinion between Kishorelal and myself on this issue pains me, for behind that difference lies great anguish of mind on Kishorelal’s part. Were it not for that. I think the difference of opinion between us would not be so painful to me. I would advise you not to worry in the least about this issue as long as it is only at a theoretical stage.
I like you idea of going to East Africa for collecting funds.
 There can of course be no doubt about the necessity of the laws being repealed. But I am afraid they will not be totally repealed. The fact that some of the workers are selfish is certainly a handicap, but it seems right to me that you should go on doing the best that you can in a spirit of detachment.
 I think the changes with are taking place here will have an impact there. Let us see how things shape. The burden of work on me may or may not decrease, I don’t worry about that. You also need not worry.
 Prerhaps I may never be able to return to Sevagram. It seems likely that I shall have to stay on in these parts, that is, in Bihar and Noakhali.
 I have had a letter from Kaji.libtech_78_footnoteHe has complained against Dadoo and others. The letter is a long one. However, it has produced no effect on me, for have we not had similar experiences in the past ?
 I was indeed very happy to learn about your health and I wish you all success. I would even welcome your writing in detail on the subject. As a result of it you may even succeed where I failed and live up to a hundred and twenty-five years. For that, however, you should remember that diet is not the only thing. The chief thing is the mind. Food, of course, has an effect on the mind.
It is now 5 a. m. I must, therefore, get ready.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,      NEW DELHI,  July 	16, 1947 
  	The bhajan that was sung today has been known to me ever 	since I was a boy just entering high school. It appeared as a prayer 	in  a little book for children called Bal Mitra. It is 	a good and sweet bhajan and it teaches the truth that we 	should not be too concerned with the body. They body is there today 	and will be gone tomorrow. It will either be hurnt up and become 	ashes or go to the grave and become mixed with the soil. If it is 	cast into water it will be eaten up by marine life. In the end it is 	all the same. What does not sound so good in the bhajan is 	the words ‘‘after me the deluge’’. True it has been composed 	by Kabir, but what of it? I do not like it. In my humble opinion it 	shows selfishness. Why should the deluge overtake the world after I 	am dead? In the first place we do not really die. For the self is 	immortal. As for the world it is ever changing. It is God’s play. 	But we do not go wholly by what the bhanan says. If we did, 	where was the need of a Constituent Assembly? Where was the need of 	all the laws that our leaders are busy enacting. If they had all 	taken up the attitude of ‘‘after me the deluge’’, no one 	would have been doing anything for anyone. This sentiment, 	therefore, is an expression of extreme selfishness.  	Some newspapermen had been to see me. In the course of the talk 	Dravidastan was mentioned. Dravidastan comprises the Southern part 	of India beyond the Vindhyas. The languages spoken are Tamil, 	Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada. I have acquainted myself a little bit 	with each of these languages and I can say that the are all rooted 	in Sanskrit. If you hear Telugu spoken you will find that it is full 	of Sanskrit words. Tamil too has Sanskrit words in abundance. Only 	they have been given Dravidian dress. Malayalam too resembless 	Sanskrit. And the same is true of Kannada. I do not treat 	Dravidastan as something apart from India. The British have made us 	all one. Everyone living between Kashmir and Kanaya-kumari is an 	Indian. To make distinctions such as Aryans or non-Aryans or the 	Aryavrata and Dravidastan is foolish. I am quite certain about this. That 	leads to the question of language. We have here two 
 languages, Hindi and Urdu, which were developed in  India  by Indians. Their grammar is the same. I have combined these two to form Hindustani. This is spoken by many crores of people. It is the common language of Hindus and Muslims. If you sopke Sanskritized Hindi or Urdu laden with Arabic and Persian expressions such as Prof. Abdul Bari spoke, very few people would understand you. Does it then mean that we are to ignore the four languages of Dravidastan? That is not what I have in mind. All I want is that each province should use its own language for internal purposes but must learn Hindustani as the national language. All provinces have their own languages. Oriya, Bengali, Assames, Sindhi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, they are all distinct from Hindustani. Should we rather learn these languages or accept English as our national language? If I were to speak to you in English, very few of you would be able to understand me. We can only have a very meagre  smattering  of English even if we work hard at it for eight or 10 years. It is enough to drive the country mad. English therefore cannot be our national language. It can be the language of international communication. It can be the language of commerce, though even in this capacity it has not found universal acceptance so far. The national language of India can be no other than Hindustani. While provincial languages must remain, the language sopken by the largest number of people is Hindustani. I have been associated with the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. The kind of language used there is not easy to understand nor is very pure Urdu easily understandable. The language of the masses is Hindustani. We can created in it as much literature as we need. It is the duty of the people of Dravidastan to learn Hindustani alongside their own languages. If they could learn Hindustani in both Devangari and Persian scripts it would be even better. Thus they should be able to have a knowledge of both the languages. But if they want to learn just enough Hindustani to make themselves understood they can learn it in their own respective scripts. In Madras the Hindustani Prachar Sabha is engaged in the work of teaching people Hindustani through their own script.
 He freely admitted that if it was wrong for the Southerners not to learn Hindustani, it was equally wrong for the Northerners not to learn one or more of the Southern languages which had rich literature. He appealed to members from the South not to ask for an English speech in an Indian audience. They would then soon pick up Hindustani. Let them remember that India could exist as a free country only if it accepted moral government. Congress as a fighting machine against bondage was held together by its moral force.libtech_79_footnote
 
 
 It is a misfortune indeed that while we have hardly disposed of one question, with Pakistan formed, we are faced with the demand for Dravidastan. If this tendency persists, where will India be? What can be more paradoxical than that, while as a slave country we remained united, we should begin to break up as soon as freedom is gained ?

We have so many of those soldiers in India. Why did not they show their worth? We would not have witnessed two world wars which we did if there were any truth in the claim people make about the virtues of military training. And nobody can tell when a third world war may flare up. Both violence and non-violence have equal need for discipline and unity. Let me tell you that a peaceful and non- violent victory is far superior to a violent victory. There is not the least doubt about it.

They thought it was better to partition the country so that both the parts could live happily and peacefully rather than let the whole country go to pieces. About this I did hold a different view. My view was that no one could take an inch of land by resorting to violence and murder. Let the whole country be reduced to ashes. They could take the whole country by friendly negotiations and peaceful methods. But though non-violence is a creed with me, it is not so with the Congress. There is only one other person in  the country who has accepted non-violence as a creed and he is Badshah Khan. It is true that I had believed that our satyagraha struggles were based on non-violence. Only lately I realized that it was not true. I admit my mistake. I first started the satyagraha struggle in Sought Africa. At one of the meetings Mr. Hoskenlibtech_86_footnotelibtech_87_footnotesaid that Gandhi was fighting a weak man’s battle. I strongly contradicted him and produly said that what was needed for satyagraha was spiritual strength and not physical strength, and that we were fighting with soul-force. As you know we were quite successful in that struggle. Immediately after that I came away to India. I employed the same method here. At the time I did believe that people were fighting with genuine spiritual strength. I would not have launched the struggle if I had then realized that it was only ‘‘passive resistance’’. But God had willed to use me for this mission and so he blurred my vision. And because our fight was not one of non-violence we see the result today. There is arson,
 
 murder, loot and chaos all around.
 Non-violence and weakness are contradictory terms. I have been in public life for the last sixty years and I have never felt so much despair as I do now. I learnt from my childhood not to admit such a thing as failure. Nevertheless today I am struggling against this all- pervading darkness to find some light somewhere. Bear in mind that India will be wiped out from the face of the earth if she rejects the path of non-violence. Nay, the whole world may be on the way to perdition. Quite soon we shall be getting our freedom from  the  British. But if now we again lose that freedom, the word itself will be forgotten and its is quite possible that a military regime will take over. This is the reason for the despair that has taken hold of my heart. How wonderful is non-violence of the brave! I am trying day and night to cultivate it. It will be enough if I can cultivate the non-violence of the brave as far as I am concerned. I pray to God that He may give me that strength.
 I say to you that if someone comes to kill you, do not be afraid and do not move from your place but let him kill you. I shall be content if, when someone comes to kill me, I can remain composed, let myself be killed and pray to God that He may grant good sense to the killer—as these girls sing every day. I had said in the Asian Conference which was held here about four months ago that the man who made the atom bomb would have to come to India to study non- violence and the fragrance of the non-violence of India would permeate the whole world. Let us see when my hope materializes.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,      NEW DELHI,  July 	17, 1947 
  	We learn from newspaperslibtech_88_footnotethat the Indians in South Africa are being subjected to 	goondaism. They are being killed. I was in South Africa for 	twenty years and I know how Indians are treated in that country. 	There is a large number of Muslims there but they all call 	themselves Indians. May God give us all the sense at least to call 	ourselves Indians when we are in a foreign country.  	Recentlly Saruplibtech_89_footnotehad 	 been   to  the  United  Nations  along  with Justice Chagla and 	other to present before the world body the case of the South African 	Indians. Since then harassment of Indian in south Aftrica has taken 	a new form. It is not the law that has been unleashed against them 	but goondaism. If this goes on, how will the handful of 	Indians be able to live there? Once I marched into the Transvaal 	with two thousand people. Not a single Boer so much as touched us. 	Some of them ever gave us water to drink. We have plenty of water 	here. But it is not in such abundance there. People collect water 	when it rains and keep it stored in tanks. The Boers were friendly 	and we went wherever we wanted. But I see a different picture today. 	Now that we have two Governments here, I shall ask Mr. Jinnah and 	Jawaharalal to send a joint telegram to Smutslibtech_90_footnote. Mr. Smuts considers me his friend. As a friend I must 	entreat him to tell the Whites not to do physical violence to even 	one single Indian. And if he cannot make himself obeyed, he must 	resign. Lord Mountbatten too should not helplessly watch. He is an 	Admiral of the Fleet and is of Royal family. Philip Mountbatten, who 	is going to marry Princess Elizabeth, is like a son to him. Besides, 	up to the 15th of August he will be the Viceroy and afterwards the 	Governor-General. He should therefore make use of      
 these advantages and tell Smuth that India is now a Dominion even as South Africa is, that it is now a member of the vast family that is the British Commonwealth and that the ill-treatment of Indians in South Africa should forthwith stop.
 It has been said that Dominion Status is even better than full independence. But till I have tasted this fruit I cannot say whether it is nectar or poison. Maybe it is nectar. But let us first taste it.
 My advice to South African Indians is that they should live there as good citizens. Those of them who are wealthy should not neglect their Muslim brethren who are like untouchables there.
 I had been asked, now that temples in Tamil Nad and Andhra have been opened to Harijans, what is the situation with regard to temples in the U. P.? There are the temples in Hardwar for instance. Can Harijans visit these temples? In Travancore this was acheived long ago. Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar, the State’s Diwan, who at  the moment is perhaps a little angry with us, had presuaded the Maharaja to abolish untouchability by law. In the U. P., besides Hardwar there is Kashi. Can Harijans visit the temples there? If the Harajans cannot visit those temples, them I shall consider those temples impure. All the religions of the world are today faced with a severe test. Hindusim should in not 99 per cent but 100 per cent marks.

   DISCUSSION WITH SIKH VISITORS      NEW 	DELHI, 
  [On or before July 18, 1947]libtech_91_footnoteVISITORS : It is not good that you still trust the nationalist Muslims. The Leaguers are not at all satisfied with the Pakistan they have got. They want Ajmer,  Agra, Delhi and Aligarh. Only if you saw them yourself could you have and idea of the  atrocities 	perpetrated by them. Still you blame the Hindus alone.  GANDHIJI360 : 	Let me take your last point first. I grant  that  Hindus 	there are being very cruelly treated. But to take revenge here for 	this increases my shame. Why do you not face them there even with 	arms and defend yourselves? What do you gain by taking an eye for an 	eye?     Harijan, 	Sushila Nayyar 	reported this under the date-line July 18. 
 Now about your misgivings about the nationalist Muslims. It is not becoming for us to distrust them. I will give you my own  example. My eldest son Harilal often comes here. So many times he has given me his word that he will give up bad company and his many vices. And not once has he kept his word. But even so if he again comes to me today and promises that he will reform himself, how can I get angry with him? I will encourage him to keep his word. Only then is there hope of his reforming. In the same way we must trust the Muslim of India when they say that they will be loyal to India. But at the same time we should remain fully vigilant.
 The world cannot function without trust. Isn’t there a saying that faith makes the ships move? You have seen how much harm the British have done to India. I must confess the even now I have to be vigilant as far as they are concerned. And yet we would not have made so much progress it we had not trusted Lord Mountbatten.libtech_92_footnote
 We must however be prepared to fight the danger.
 The real preparation lies in purging ourselves of our inherent weakness, selfishness and disunity.

The reluctance to accept other people’s services is, to my  mind, 	a form of pride. True, it is a sin to exact service from other 	people    
 when we are in no real need of it, ourselves lolling the while in luxurious beds. But when we are too ill to attend to our needs, it becomes our duty to accept service from others, for the body is not our property but belongs to God.

 It is far better bravely to commit suicide than to yield out of fear and live. I see no violence in such suicide. There is violence in suppressing oneself and living in fear. Physically, suicide may be violence, but it is not so from a higher point of view. You will be able to see from this what sort of ahimsa it is that I cherish.

   TALK WITH CHINESE COUPLE      NEW 	DELHI, 
  July 	18, 1947  	There   is  no   reason   to   feel   unhappy.libtech_96_footnoteOn   the   contrary   I congratualte you that 	even though you hold such a high office you are not infatuated with 	this language. Besides, to me also English is a foreign language. So 	both of us are in the same plight. If 	America does not put her affluence to good use, its very    
 affluence will ruin it. If America tries to win friendship of other countries with the help of her money, and if China, Japan, Iran, India, Pakistan or any other country gets involved with her even in a small degree, both will come to grief. That is why I have been daily telling Rajendra Babu that import of foodgrains is the worst kind of slavery. There is nothing more degrading for a country than to beg from others when it cannot meet its requirements.
 It is a practical principle that if you want to be friends with someone and if you want the friendship to endure, you should not seek economic aid from them. So, however rich America may be we shall only become crippled if we seek economic aid from her.
 I am of the firm opinion that there is absolutely no need of machines either in India or in the rest of Asia. I have no use for machines which deprive men of employment and keep them starved and naked, no matter how much they are the fashion today and highly admired and how effective they may be in changing cities into paradises. I would certainly not feel sorry if there was an accident and all the machines were destroyed.libtech_97_footnote

  July 	18, 1947  	If only the women of the world would come together they could 	display such heroic non-violence as to kick away the atom bomb like  	a mere ball. Women have been so gifted by God. If an ancestral 	treasure lying buried in a corner of the house unknown to  the 	members of the family were suddenly discovered, what a celebration 	it would occasion. Similarly women’s marvellous power is lying 	dormant. If the women of Asia wake up, they will dazzle the world. 	My experiment in non-violence would be instantly successful if  I 	could secure women’s help. [From 	Gujarati]  Bihar 	Pachhi Dilhi, p. 354          
  
   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_98_footnote       NEW 	DELHI, 
  July 	18, 1947  Gandhiji 	began his speech 	by drawing 	attention to the 	bhajan of 	the evening 	and said 	that he did 	not know whether 	it was 	Mira’s. The 	tune was 	different from 	Mirabai’s ordinary 	tune. The sentiment 	was undoubtedly 	hers. It said 	God alone 	could extricate 	man from 	difficulties. Today India was 	passing through 	difficulties. Was she 	to look to man or God to 	deliver the country? If they believed in the bhajan 	, they were  to look to God and none else and they would be perfectly safe. The 	bhajan just sung is very much to the point, for we are today  	in great distress. We have no food to eat, no cloth to cover 	ourselves with. To whom shall we go for help? To Jawaharlal Nehru? 	Or Sardar Patel? For they have today become the rulers. The Viceroy 	has given up or is about to give up power. He will now be the 	Governor-General because we have chosen him to be so. Formerly 	important officials used to be appointed from London. But now the 	Indian Independence Bill has been passed and even the consent of the 	King has  been secured for it.  According 	to the Bill, the Governor-General would be appointed by them, the 	people of India, and not imposed on India as hitherto. Therefore 	Lord Mountbatten would be Governor-General of India. By their 	appointment precisely as a chaprasi 	would be. This was 	not said in disparagement. It was a compliment paid to Lord 	Mountbatten that he had been elected to be Indian Union’s servant 	deriving his appointment from them. It was necessary to say this in 	order to dispel the suspicion that still lingered in many minds. All 	power therefore is now in the hands of our people. But this  bhajan says that when we are in distress we do not go to 	anyone else, we go to God. He alone can help us. It we go about our 	affairs with God in our hearts, our affairs will prosper, otherwise 	not. He is the ruler of the world and our good lies in surrendering 	ourselves to Him.  	There is a newspaper called The Dawn, published from 	Delhi. Every day it is full of abuse. I too have my share of it. I 	generally laugh it away. But today the editor has published an open 	letter addressed to me. It is well phrased. He says I have been 	shouting that Mr. Jinnah is soon going to be put to the test and 	that I should stop    
 my shouting.
 May I ask the editor why the Hindus are running away in fear and despair from Karachi which is going to be the capital of Pakistan? Why are the Hindus frightened? The Sind Hindus are first-class businessmen. Why are they running away to Bombay, Madras and other places? It will not be they who will be the losers but Sind. For they will make money for themselves wherever they go. One finds Sindhis in South America. There is hardly any place in the world where Sindhis are not found. In South Africa the were making big money and they gave of it liberally to the poor. They have one vice, viz., drinking. They do not seem to be able to give it up.
 The Dawn asks why I address myself only to Mr. Jinnah and the other League leaders. What is happening in the U.P. which is my province? But Sind too is my province. The whole of India including Pakistan is my province. I consider myself a citizen of Pakistan but not because I want to claim any citizenship rights. I seek no office. All I want is just enough to eat, which God gives me. I know nothing about the U.P. Besides, I have not blamed anyone. The editor of The Dawn is a big man. If he thinks that what I say is not right, why does he bother? There are so many like me who go about saying what they want. But I had a talk with Pantji about the U.P. He told me that so far as he can he tries to protect the Muslims, but that the Government cannot reach everywhere because the  Muslim  Leaguers  are everywhere hurling abuses at the Hindus and provoking them. Occasionally Hindus too lose their temper. Pantiji admitted that what the Hindus did at Garhmukteshwar was not right. According to newspaper reports even the League leaders of the U.P. have praised the Work of the Pant Ministry.
 I should like to remind the Dawn editor that even if what he says is right and even if what Pantji says is not the gospel truth, there is no reason why for one Muslim throat cut in the U.P. ten Hindus throats should be cut in Sind or the Punjab. I want to live to see the day when this communal madness is forgotten. Whatever be our religion we should be Indians in action. Only then shall we be able to safeguard our freedom.
 If the Dawn editor truly wants to serve Islam, I shall tell him that this is not the way of Islam. As for saying things to Mr. Jinnah I have been saying what I like even to Lord Mountbatten and Jawaharlal Nehru. If Jawaharlal’s words and actions differ, I shall shun him even
 though he is a pandit. But I must advise the Dawn editor that he should flush the poison out of his pen. National newspapers contain many things that are good and many things that are bad. If we can agree and stop publishing news of mutual strife I shall consider that we have achieved something.
 Gandhiji said he had a suggestion to make to The Dawn and all the newspapers, whatever their hue, they should avoid all exaggeration. In order to give effect to the suggestion, they should appoint a joint board to which all reports about communal trouble would be submitted and even passed on the responsible Ministers and, when necessary, given publicity.
 His suggestion could find favour only if the editors realized their duty to the public and were anxious that a peremptory stop should be put to all communalism. Division having become a settled fact, it was surely time that the country was allowed to take up the task of feeding and clothing the ill-fed and ill-clad millions. The editors had a weighty part to play in the noble task. To foment trouble was ignoble.

  INTERVIEW TO NAGA LEADERSlibtech_105_footnote

 GANDHIJI: Why not now? Why wait for August 15? I was independent when the whole of India was under the British heel. You can be independent and if you have non-violence in common with me, no one can deprive you of independence.
 NAGA LEADERS: Government said that if we become independent military sanctions will be applied against us.
The Government is wrong. I will come to Kohima and ask them
to shoot me before they shoot one Naga.
 The trouble will not be started by us. It may be started in spite of us.
 You have opened a very large subject. Independence, yes. But if you say you will be independent of the whole world, you cannot do it.  I am independent in my own home. It I become independent of Delhi,  I would be crushed to atoms. I have not stored food. I have to get it from Delhi. I have not stored water here; vegetables I have to get. As I can see, you are all slaves. I am not. From where do you get your
 
 cloth?
 It is foreign cloth.
 Then you are slaves of foreigners. Will you go naked if the foreigners do not give you cloth? What of you food?
 We grow enough.
You cannot be in complete isolation.
 We do not talk of isolation.
 Then no army will deprive you of your freedom. Those days are gone.
 We will be friends with all.
 Then you are safe so far as India is concerned. India has shed blood for her own freedom. Is she going to deprive others of their freedom? Personally, I believe you all belong to me, to India. But if you say you don’t no one can force you.
 Is there any word for the Nagas?
 If I come there I will teach you the art of spinning and weaving. You grow cotton and yet you import cloth. Learn all the handicrafts. That’s the way to peaceful independence. If you use rifles and guns and tanks, it is a foolish thing.
 No, we certainly shall not do that.

I should like to 	draw your attention to a disturbing phenomenon and that is that 	everyone in the Congress wants to climb the ladder by using his 	connection with the Congress. It is something very dirty. Had 	Congressmen been only a handful and they had cherished such a desire 	one could have understood it, but the Congress has many crores of 	people in it and if they all harbour ambitions of advancement the 	Congress rule will be killed. Thre are only two kinds of poeple who 	must have jobs: those who have no other recourse left and those who 	want to serve without 
 any thought of self-interest. Since the Congress now holds the reins of administration in its hands, it now commands huge revenues and the spending of the revenues. If Congressmen should entertain the feeling that a portion of all the money that is spent should go to them and if the tax-payers get it into their heads that they no longer need pay taxes, it won’t do at all. It will mean that we have forgotten our duty and taken to unrighteous ways.
 I am being flooded with telegrams. I cannot say I am the only one to receive telegrams. Those who are in the seats of power, I am sure, must be receiving many more telegrams., Some  say  cow- slaughter must be stopped, particularly cows whic provide us milk and draught cattle should be saved. Perhaps the friends sending the wires do not know that even when I was in South Africa I was a devotee of the cow. And if we are devoted to the cow we have got to protect her. Unfortunately those who ought to be saviours of the cow have become devourers of the cow. People send me wires expecting me to persuade Jawaharlal and the Sardar to enact laws to protect the cow. But I will not do so. I will ask these devotees of the cow not to waste their money on telegrams. Let them spend that money on the cow. If they cannot themselves do so let them send the money to me. I must say that it is we who are responsible for cow-slaughter. We give the cows so little to eat and make the bullocks carry such heavy loads that they become like skeletons. We use the goad to make the bullocks go faster. What right have such people to demand the cow-slaughter be stopped? After all most cows are owned by the Hindus. Why do they sell them to slaughter-houses? No Hindu will think of buying a cow with a low milk yield. Goshala people might well buy one for they have money received from donations. The others go to slaughter- houses. I have never seen anywhere in the world such enfeebled cattle as in India. In the name of dharma we are practising adharma. No law that Jawaharlal Nehru or Sardar can enact wil stop cow-slaughter. There were laws even during the war, for milk was in demand. Even then milch cows were slaughtered and this will be the case there too. This will be the case in Pakistan.
 I have been asked some questions. Here is one: ‘‘One understands that the national flag that has been proposed will have a littele Union Jack in a corner. It that is so, we shall tear up such a flag and, if need be, sacrifice our lives.’’
ANSWER: But what is wrong with having the Union Jack in a
 conrner of our flag? If harm has been done to us by the British it has not been done by their flag and we must also take note of the virtues of the British. They are volunatrily withdrawing from India, leaving power in our hands. A drastic bill which  virtually  liquidates  the Empire did not take even a week to pass in Parliament. Time was when even very unimportant bills took a year and more to be passed. Whether they have been honest in framing the bill only experience will show. We are having Lord Mountbatten as our chief gate-keeper. So long he has been the servant of the British king. Now he is to be our servant. If while we employed him as our servant we also had the Union Jack in a corner of our flag, there would be no betrayal of India in this.
 This is my opinion. But I understand that the report is not true. It pains me that the Congress leaders could not show this generosity. We would have thereby shown our friendship for the British. If I had the power that I once had I would have taken the people to task for it. After all, why should we give up our humanity.

  A LETTER 
 July 20, 1947
 I am indeed impatient to go to Bihar, but a visit to Kashmir has also been mooted. The matter will be decided by the end of the month. The Kashmir visit will be only for two days. Doctors have suggested that I should not take Manu with me for those two days, for her health will not be able to bear the strain of the journy. But I believe that, even if it be only for two days, the Kashmir climate is bound to benefit her. Besides, even in her sleep she is often heard muttering, beseeching me not to leave her behind…libtech_107_footnotelibtech_108_footnoteHow then can I leave her here and go alone? Another suggestion also has been made, namely, that I should take her to Kashmir and leave her there with Begum Sheikh Abdulla. A month’s rest there, together with  the climate of Kashmir, will benefit her. I will, therefore, take her only if she agrees to this condition, otherwise, after returning from Kashmir I intend to leave for Calcutta and reach Noakhali on August 15 and I will take her along with me. This is just for your information. In the end I have to do what Manu wants.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER METTING         BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,     NEW DELHI,  July 	20, 1947 
  	Some people tell me—as they have a right to tell me—that what I 	say these days is not calculated to enthuse the people. They remind 	me that the political freedom for which we had been fighting, we 	have at last secured and by and by economic freedom will also come. 	All that may be true. Nevertheless I cannot rejoice on August 15. I 	do not want to deceive you. But at the same time I shall not ask you 	not to rejoice. After all I cannot expect everything to be ordered 	according to my wish. I did not want India to be partitioned but it 	has been partitioned. What good can come of crying over it? Even if 	something worse had happened, I would have had to put up with it. 	India’s partition has grieved me more than it could grieve you. I 	have been a rebel all my life. How can a rebel cry? When I went to 	Noakhali I found people crying and I wiped their tears. I told them 	nothing was to be gained by weeping fort the dead. But the people in 	whose hands we have entrusted the reins of power are big poeple. If 	they say that we should have celebrations on Independence Day, then 	you should do so. You should no worry why Gandhi does not join in 	the 
 celebration. The Congress does not force anyone to celebrate. That I shall not celebrate does not mean that the British will not be leaving. By August 15, a number of British officers will have already left the country. Those who remain will stay under our authority. They will be appointed not from London but by us.
 Unfortunately the kind of freedom we have got today contains also the seeds of future conflict between India and Pakistan. How can we therefore light the lamps? I shall consider freedom to have been secured only on the day Hindus and Muslims have cleansed their hearts. Only lately some Muslim League friends from the Punjab have held out the threat that if the Boundary Commission does not decide in their favour they will get what they want by fighting. The Sikhs also are holding out similar threats. But when we accept the principle of arbitration we must go by the award. We should not talk of fighting. I know only one kind of fighting and that is satyagraha. It purifies the soul. If that kind of fighting went on all the time in the world it would be very good for the world. I shall appeal to my Hindu, Sikh and Muslim brethren that once having accepted  the  Boundary Commission as the arbitrator they should accepts its award.
 Burma too will soon be a free country like India. The Burmese leader General U Aung San, has brought Burma to the gates of freedom. What does it matter that he was not a satyagrahi? He was a brave warrior and it is largely thanks to his efforts that Burma is about to get its freedom. It is a great tragedy that an armed gang of assassins killed him and his four comrades.libtech_113_footnotelibtech_114_footnoteHowever far we may be from him, his sudden death is a matter of grief to us. If such things are to continue, then the world has come to a sorry pass. I cannot believe that the assassins were dacoits. I had spent a long time in Burma. I am acquainted with Rangoon, Mandalay and other palces. Buddhism is the religion there as it is in the rest of Burma. Why should there be so much blod-shed in a country where Buddhism is the religion? I am sure behind these murders there is factional politiics. It is sad that this has happened when Burma is about to gain its freedom. I hope India will take a lesson from this tragedy. Let us pray that in this time of sorrow God may grant comfort to the people of Burma who like us have been fighting for their freedom and grant strength  to  the relatives of the dead to bear the grief. Let us also pray that the hearts of the murderers may change.
 
 The editor of The Dawn has in today’s issue of the paper accepted two of my suggestions.libtech_115_footnotelibtech_116_footnoteIt makes me very happy. He says that he can assure me that in Pakistan Hindus and Muslims will live as brothers. He further says that there should be  a  committe  of journalists which should examine reports of communal riots and should decide what should be published. He suggests that as I am a journalist myself I could become the chairman of such a committee. I must express to him my inability. I do not have the time. Also I am no longer fitted for this kind of work. Besides I am never at one place for long. How should I then preside over such a body? But if he is serious about it he can meet other editors and do something.
 I must finally say once again that only when the minorities both in India and Pakistan say that they are happy can freedom be said to have been really gained and only then will it be time for us to rejoice.

 I received you long letter only yesterday. Yours is the first letter I have taken up after the prayer. It is ten minutes past four just now.
 You are unnecessarily angry with…libtech_117_footnotelibtech_118_footnoteIs it her fault that she did not see you? Don’t you know that she feels deeply obliged to you? Is she likely to slight you. You have virtues and defects  in  equal measure. Let you defects remain with you. We will worship your virtues and extract from them whatever fragrance they are capable of giving.
 You will rise still higher if you give up defending me and you will also oblige me.
 I like what you say regarding your relatives. You should not copy me in the distinction you have seen me make in my behaviour between relatives and others. You should copy my virtues, but not my errors. Anything good I may do should be looked upon as golden. In such instances you should copy me both in speech and deed. You should, therefore, always keep in mind what I said regarding the
 
 brothers. I do not wish to make any change in it. My own sister is on her death bed, but I do not go to her, nor do I go looking for doctors. On the other hand, I did everything possible for Chakrayya. Draw a lesson from this if you can. If, nonetheless, you see any partiality in me, you should reject my partiality and copy only my concern for others. You should know that I also, like all living and lifeless things, have virtues and defects, and should behave accordingly. I think you did a wise thing in writing about this matter. It is because of that that I am able to explain my point of view to you. You may ask me for further explanation when we meet some time, if you and I remember the matter then. I liked your letter so much that, instead of tearing it up, I am giving it to Bisen and Manudi to read.

 BHANGI COLONY, NEW DELHI,
 July 21, 1947
 I had a letter from. . .libtech_120_footnotelibtech_121_footnoteShe says that I waste my time on Manu. Poor woman, how can she know that in my eyes that time is most valuably spent? For I have undertaken to be a mother to that girl, and by devoting time to achievement of that aim I wish to uncover to the world a great spiritual mystery similar to that which I have demonstrated concerning truth and ahimsa. I am no doubt a father to so many other girls, but why am I a mother to Manu alone? That, however, is a long story. Here I will say only this, that I saw in her the necessary readiness to look upon me as a mother. She is devoted to me as a daughter to her mother, is eager to serve me and is as innocent as a child. I have not seen in any other girl the virtues I have seen in her. God has, therefore, given me a means at the right time whereby I can prove to the world that if men could develop the attitudes of mothers, humanity would be saved. In India and in Pakistan, women are being wickedly dishonoured. If that is to be ended, I think men will have to learn to be not father but mothers. But I shall not dwell further on this subject. I am short of time. I am not at all happy that your health has again taken a turn for the worse. I don’t see your articles in Harijan these days. I should like you to go on writing something, if necessary, with somebody’s help. For my part, I can barely cope with my work. I have Sushila and Rajkumari with me now and hope, therefore, that I shall get their help. Thingking over the matter, I even feel that I should stop the Harijan.
 Chi. Manudi is improving gradually. But as soon as she feels better, she starts running about and falls ill again. As a result, I have to pay more attention to her when she is well than when she is ill. But I see that even she is being carefull now.
 Probably I shall have to go to Kashmir towards the end of this month… also is here. She has returned ill from Noakhali. I will see what I can do for her.

  LETTER  TO KISHORELAL G. MASHRUWALA 
 NEW DELHI,
 July 21, 1947
 
CHI. KISHORELAL,
 I have your letter. Whether you call it my despondency or grief the cause of it is the same. How can non-violence overcome the prevailing violence? Passing through the turmoil, I have realized that although our 30 years’ struggle could be called non-violent, it was not firmly founded on non-violence and so it ought not to have been so called. If it were not regarded as non-violent, my energy would not have been spent over it. That is why God made me blind and allowed me to be used. How can we create non-violence out of what was mistakenly called non-violence but which was really violence? Isn’t it all wrong training? How can one have the right training now, i. e., in true non-violence, after having had 30 years of wrong training? We may name this churning of the heart anguish or anything else you like.
 Is your analysis correct? If we are cautious and take the right steps we can undo our earlier lapses. But who will do it and how? There is a barrier everywhere which we must cross.
So being far away don’t magnify my anguish.
 I am happy. One thing is true; the heat here does not agree with me but I don’t feel like going to the hills either. There is nothing to worry about.
 Blessings to you all from

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 
 NEW DELHI,
 July 21, 1947
 A friend from Pakistan writes :libtech_135_footnotelibtech_136_footnote“You in India are talking about celebrating August 15. Have you ever considered how we, the Hindus in Pakistan are going to celebrate it? Our hearts  are  full  of  forebodings for that day, Will you say some- thing about this? For us the day will be one for confronthing troubles, not at  all  for celebration. The Muslims here have already begun to frighten us. We do not know what the Muslims in India think. Will they also not be frightened? We are even scared that attempts may be made to convert us on a large scale. You will say that we must ourselves safeguard our faith. This may be possible for an ascetic. It is not so for a householder.”
 Mr. Jinnah is now going to be the Governor-General of Pakistan. He has said that non-Muslims will be treated exactly as the Muslims. My advice is that we should trust him and hope that non- Muslims in Pakistan will not be ill-treated. And also the Muslims in India will not be ill-treated. My feeling is that now that there are two States, India can ask for guarantees from Pakistan.
 I nevertheless feel that August 15 is not day  for  celebrationlibtech_137_footnotewhilst the minorities contemplate the day with a heavy heart. It will be a day for prayer and introspection. Only, if the two countries are to be true to themselves they should start being friends right now. Either all
 
 should together celebrate August 15 as brothers or it should not be celebrated at all. The day for rejoicing over freedom will be when we feel sincere friendship for each other. But this is my own individual opinion and nobody seems to share it.
 The same friend from Pakistan then asks me: ‘If all the Hindus of Pakistan or a very large number of them come away from Pakistan, will India give them shelter ?’
 I think that such people should certainly be given shelter. However, if the well-to-do among them want to live in their old style, that will be difficult. In any case, they should certainly be given a place to live and they should be paid for their work. But I shall continue to hope that no non-Muslim will be forced to flee Pakistan out of fear and no Indian Muslim will flee his motherland.
 The correspondent further asks: “What will happen to houses and landed property left behing in Pakistan ?”
 I have already said that the Government of Pakistan should pay the market price of the land and houses. The practice in such matters is that the other Government also has a say. In this case it will be the Government of India. But why should I assume that the matter will go so far? It will be the duty of the Government of Pakistan to pay the price of such land and houses to the owners.
 The correspondent reminds me that I consider myself a practical idealist. But what is going on in the country is in- human. Can non- violence be practised towards the criminal, and if so, how? My endeavour always has been so to practise my ideal that it should produce results even though I May not always succeed. Whom shall I call criminal? All those described as criminal by Manu cannot be put to death today. Today attempts are being made to abolish capital Punishment and reformers even go so far as to advocate abolition of all corporal punishment. They say that evil-doers  should  be considered as sick and hospitals should be set up for them as for those suffering from other diseases. What I mean to say is that everything that goes by the name of scripture should not be accepted as  scriputure. Only that should be accepted as scripture which takes into consideration the various changes that are continually taking place. Attitudes keep changing from age to age. There are few laws which remain unchanged for ever. And then it is not everyone’s province to punish criminals. This right belongs to the elected body or the government. The government makes laws and then courts are set up to
 dispense justic according to those laws. If that were not so there would be the risk of all of us becoming criminals. The murders that were committed in Burma were brutal. Now we understand that they were political murders.libtech_138_footnoteI am sure that the murderers regarded their victims as criminals. Our terrorists did not accept my advice. They sincerely told me that those whom them murdered were criminals. They never regarded themselves as criminals. That is why I say that he who takes the law into his own hands commits an offence. He commits violence against the people. Only an elected Assembly can dispense with the obligation to be non-violent. What is happening in the world today is brutality.

  A TERRIBLE CONTRASTlibtech_139_footnote 
 Prof. Kumarappa is at present in London. From his letter received from there I quote the following extracts :
 The air travel, as I explained to you, is extremely dull as the sense of motion that we get on surface travel is practically absent. From our height you can see nothing but the bare red earth with some streaks indicating rivers. Trees, etc., are not visible except as chumps of grass here and there. . . .
 Last evening I strolled all over Marble Arch, Hyde Park, Kensington, Westminster, Whitehall, James’ Park, Piccadilly, Bond Street, etc., clad in my dhotijamma. London is hot even for that. Our old-time London of plenty and pleasure seems to have undergone a radical change. There seems to be very effective rationing in which a great deal of credit should be given to the willing co-operation of the public in restraining themselves in the interests of all. This is in striking contrast to our lack of a public conscience. I used to think the efficiency of rationing here was a credit to the efficiency of the Government machinery here. But I think now that it is largely due to public self-control that even black markets are not able to hold their own. Our culture though based on self-discipline and self-control has to extend its influence to public behavior. This should be the foundation of our swaraj.
Assuming the correctness of the information the writer gives, the
 
 contrast between the willing co-operation in London and the black marketing with all its implication here is terrible.

  REALIZATION OF DIFFICULTY 
 An English sister reading my recent speeches giving a glimpse of my grief over the happenings in India writes :
 Does not this deep agony, this descent into hell, this  feeling of something near despair, mean that you ought to extend your life-span even further than 125 years? How very much easier it would be to die!. . . Day and night one feels the narrow of hell. . . .
I know that she is not joking when she expects me to extend my
 life-span even further than 125 years. She is a brave woman of great faith. With me there is no question of extending my life-span even to one day longer than the allotted time. I am fatalist enough to believe that not a blade of grass moves but by His will. What I have done and still would wish to do is to aspire after a life of 125 years, provided that it is a life of uttermost service of humanity. But such a wish becomes quite empty if it is not accompanied by the requisite correctness of conduct. Answering the description of a steadfast man of the Gita, such are the lines according to Sir Edwin Arnold’s rendering :libtech_140_footnote
 I confess that in spite of my trying to reach the state, I am far away from the condition of equipoise. I realize how difficult it is in the face of the storm raging round us.
She says in the same letter :
 The only comfort is that mankind, some of it, has discovered its innate impotence apart from God.
The motto in her letter-head is:
 In hearts too young for enmity
 There lies the way to make men free. . . .
How true and yet how difficult!

[From 	Hindi]  Bihar 	Pachhi Dilhi, p. 379     TALK TO REFUGEE STUDENTS   NEW DELHI,  July 	22, 1947  	If you ask me, my advice can appeal to you only if you have no love 	for degrees. Only then can I give you time. If you want degrees you 	can work for them without giving thought to anything else. You     
 will think it natural in me, an old man from your point of view, to advise students not to run after degrees. However it is not so. I say what I do with the fullest sense of responsibility. All that you learn is not real learning. It is no more than stuffing you merely with a knowledge of the letters. Ture education is that which proves useful in life and makes you industrious.
 Students have played a big role in helping the country win its freedom. If students forget communalism and learn humanism they can easily bring about the unity which neither the laws nor the  Viceroy, nor Jawaharlal Nehru and other leaders can bring about. Let them persuade their school fellows, their parents, their sisters and purify the atmosphere in their schools, their homes and their neighbourhood. Student life is the foundation of life. It is a prepara- tion for adult life. The building can be strong only if the foundation is strong. Therefore, instead of wasting time in memorizing false history, devote yourself to true knowledge. Certainly history will give you a sort of knowledge but you should acquire the knowledge which will provide you with food for life. Teach sanitation in your camp, learn to look after the sick, take lessons in nursing, organize bhajans  and games for recreation in the evening so that those who are unhappy may forget their sorrow for a while and be comforted, the children get some knowledge of the letters and physical exercise and learn to keep their bodies and minds clean. The rainy season is approaching. Make arrangements through collective labour to protect yourselves from the rains. You can do so many such things. If you do that you will certainly learn so many things which you will never learn in your colleges. Knowledge gained through experience is far superior and many times more useful than bookish knowledge. I have no doubt about that.

  TALK WITH VISITORS 
 NEW DELHI,
 July 22, 1947
 I do not consider myself a mahatmalibtech_147_footnotelibtech_148_footnoteI am, like you, an ordinary human being and want to serve the people as long as God gives me the strength to do so. Moreover, anyone who is not distressed or ashamed by the carnage that is going on in the country must either be God or a hard-hearted man. I am neither. I feel unhappy that every day innocent men, women and children are being murdered. The reason for all this is that what I had believed to be non-violence was not pure non-violence. I have now realized it but it is too late. Even so  I am certain that if we want to bring about peace in the world there is no other way except that of non-violence.
 Q.   Now perhaps you will honour the British since they have willingly agreed  to your terms.
G.    Personally I never had any complaint against the  British.  I
 have no likes or dislikes for persons, for I consider every individual a friend and I have benefited from this. Let me make one thing clear. The British are not doing us a favour in leaving the country. They are going because circumstances have rendered their going inevitable. They ruined India during their 150 years of rule. They could have atoned for it if they had gone leaving the country whole. I must say that they have taken advantage of our weakness of will to create dissensions among us, whether knowingly or unknowingly. The fault no doubt is ours. We were so stupid as to go to them for justice. We should have told them, “Hand over the country to us. We shall settle our own affairs.” It was our mis-fortune that a third party had to meddle in our domestic affairs. For this state of affairs we have to thank the power that kept us in slavery for so long. All the same the English are my friends. Many Englishwomen are staying with me as my daughters. They have so many things to teach us. I am sure if they can remain on terms of friendship with India, both the countries will benefit. England and America have gained nothing  from  their advance in technology and by manufacturing atom bombs. But I have
 
 
 no doubt that if our so-called backward country pursues the path of non-violence it will have a place of glory in the world. I may not live to see that. My co-worker Jawahar, who is like a son to me, is working hard to make my dream come true. He will show light to the whole world. Jawahar and his colleagues appear old. The struggles of satyagraha and frequent incarcerations have reduced their expectation of life by twenty to twenty-five years. But I believe that not a blade of grass moves except by His will and I am, therefore, confident that though they are old their contribution in bringing stability to a totter- ing world will be very significant.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,     NEW DELHI,  July 	22, 1947 
  	I have received a letter today. It says: ‘You have given Lord 	Miuntbatten too much of a build-up. You seem to imply that Lord 	Mountbatten can do no wrong. But if you will remember at the Second 	Round Table Conferencelibtech_149_footnotelibtech_150_footnoteyou had said that when  freedom was achieved the 	Viceroy’s house would be turned into a home for Harijan children 	or a hospital. Your present attitude is not  in conformity with 	this.’  	I do not give anyone any kind of build-up. I want nothing from Lord 	Mountbatten. And be wants nothing from me. I do not want even titles 	and he has nothing else to give. It is said that I am always 	rebuking my own people and never can find anything good to say of 	them. So far as Lord Mountbatten is concerned he must for the moment 	continue to live in the Viceroy’s house. If I could drag him out 	of it I would keep him with me. But he has to meet the Princes there 	and rectify the mistakes of the past. He has to undo the harm those 	mistakes have done. And he has been made Governor-General precisely 	because he can work with speed. Giving him this office does    
 not imply any flattery of him. And do you think Jawaharlal and Sardar Patel are the kind of people to flatter anyone? But if the Viceroy has deceit in his heart only he will be the loser. My sixty years’ experience tells me that he who seeks to deceive other deceives only himself. But I do not really know whether Lork Mountbatten will remain permanently in the Viceroy’s house or whether it will be made into a hospital. Only Jawaharlal and Sardar will know about it.
 Another correspondent wants to know if the proposal to retain British officers in the army and the partition of the army has my approval. The correspondent should rather ask me if I approve of the retention of the army itself. Keeping an army, whatever its nature or size, can have no support from me. But times have changed. I had fondly assumed that we were all or almost all non-violent. But my eyes have now been opened. What I had taken to be non-violence, I now see, was only passive resistance. Passive resistance is resorted to by a person who does not have arms. We were simply obliged to be non-violent while we had violence in our hearts. And now with the British withdrawing from India we are spending that violence in fighting against each other. I am certain that I never had any violence in my heart. But what am I to do about others? They argue that the fact they were non-violent in the fight against the British does not necessarily mean that they should be non-violent now. The fault is mine. My teaching during the last thirty-two years was imperfect. If I am asked I will still say that I am not for maintaining an army. Is India going to be a military State? From Bengal, the Punjab and Bihar there are demands for the army to be sent. If at one place it is Hindus who want the army to protect them, at another it is Muslims. I therefore have no knowledge about how the army is going to be divided and I do not care to waste my time over things which do not interest me.
 Four sisters came to congratulate me today because the tricolour with the weel has been adopted as the national flag of India. I see nothing in it for congratulations. I am told that instead of the charkha there is only a wheel on the flag. But it is all the same to me whether they keep or do not keep the charkha. Even if they cast it away I will still have it in my hand and in my heart.
 A friend tells me that the charkha is still there on the flag. Another friend tells me that it is not there, that it has been discarded
 
 even while I am still alive. I do not know. What I do know is that even if the charkha wass shown on the flag but was not in people’s hearts, both the flag and the charkha would be fit only to be burnt. But if the charkha had a place in the hearts of the people, then it would not matter whether it was placed on the flag or not. I only want that the country should have only one flag and everyone shold salute it. It made me very happy to hear that in the Constituent Assembly both Chowdhary Khaliq-uz-Zaman and Mohammed Sadullah, saluted the flag and declared that they would be loyal to the Nationla Flag. If they mean it, it is a good sign.
 But a telegram received from Sylhet is very disturbing. The referendum there is over but harassment of the people continues. Why have the Muslims there gone crazy? Nationalist Muslims are being killed and the telegram says that someone should be sent there as an observer. Whom can I send? It is only for Kripalani or Jawaharlal to find someone. I feel I ought to go to Noakhali now. Sylhet is close to Noakhali. But how can I go? I am imprisoned here. I am convinced that there is not a word of untruth in the telegram. The sender has signed his name too. It is reported that after the referendum Muslims burnt down a Harijan colony. It is a matter of shame. On one side we have Khaliq Saheb and Sadullah Saheb saluting the National Flag, on the other side in Pakistan such grisly things go on.
 From Karachi comes a letter. It is from a rich man who says that the Pakistan Government has taken over his house. He is  in  a quandary, for he has nowhere to live. I must say to Mr. Jinnah and the other leaders there that I am shocked. At such a juncture instead of rejoicing we must pray that we may be rescued from this morass and have an opportunity to taste the fruits of freedom, the freedom of which we have so long been dreaming. This is indeed a time for prayer.

 Learning a language is certainly very useful. It also helps in one’s mental growth. But the present practice of teaching the pupils compulsorily through English must be stopped now.

  A LETTER 
 July 23, 1947
 You suggest that the Government should promote education by spending crores of rupees and setting up universities. I cannot swallow the suggestion. There is no dearth in our country of people who have an interest in education. There are thousands and hundreds of thousands of them. They should form an organization and take up this work. A cultivator who wishes to grow corn ploughs and sows the field at the right time. If educationists, similarly, utilize  this  opportunity and work along the right lines in this field, their institutions will overflow with money. The university will be able to maintain itself through the labour of the students who join it. And if it becomes a people’s institution, the public also will help of their own accord. True, it will also need some Government help, which it will certainly get. If, however, the university is run along the lines I have indicated, it will become self-supporting.

 they take to doing household work they will create an atmosphere in which doing such work will no longer be regarded dishonourable but on the contrary will be respected. As a result the financial condition of the downtrodden middle class will improve and with it the education of their children, their health and their living condition also will improve. We can then feel proud of our country.

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 
 NEW DELHI,
 July 23, 1947
 Before the prayers started someone passed a note to Gandhiji. In it the writer had asked him whether he had seen God face to face. Answering the question after prayers, Gandhiji said that he had not seen God face to face. If he had, he would have no need to be speaking to them. His thought would be potent enough to render speech and action on his part unnecessary. But he had an undying faith in the existence of God. Millions all over the world shared that faith with him. The most learned could not shake the faith of illiterate millions. The bhajan sung during  the  prayers described the way to see God face to face. The poet asked the aspirant to shed anger and desire and to be indifferent to praise or blame if he expected to reach the blessed state. Gandhiji compared nirvana to Ramarajya or the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. The dream of Ramarajya was far from realization. How could it happen when they had all along been nursing violence in their hearts under the garb of non-violence?libtech_163_footnote
 Today I wish to say something about salt. People say there was a time when I had marched to Dandi for salt but today there is no salt to be had or, if there is, an exorbitant price has to be paid for it. I can only bow down my head in shame. People say that although salt tax has been abolished it has not affected the price. Salt is not rationed but there is black-marketing in it. Traders are so mean that they derive huge profits even from salt. But we have become lazy.
 There are many places in the countryside where people can make salt for themselves at no cost. This concession had been got even at the time of my agreementlibtech_164_footnotelibtech_165_footnotewith Lord Irwin. If we were not lazy we would be getting salt not only cheap but also clean. The salt available
 
 
 in the market is very dirty. The reason is that people do not take pains. The salt that was given to me in jail I used to clean myself. We have become so selfish today that we cannot even let people have salt at a low price. How can we call a regime Ramarajya where even salt is denied to the people? Salt is needed not only for human beings but also for animals. What I fear is that now as a consequence of partition both the countries will need to increase their revenues and they may impose tax on salt. But will they be so lacking in sense as to deprive people even of salt? If that happens, too great a price will have been paid for freedom.

 CHI. JAWAHARLALlibtech_166_footnote,
 I did not say anything yesterday about the Maulana Saheb. But my objection stands. His retiring from the cabinet should not affect our connection with him. There are many positions which he can occupy in public life without any harm to any cause. Sardar is decidedly against his membership in the cabinet and so is Rajkumari. Your cabinet must be strong and effective at the present juncture. It should not be difficult to name another Muslim for the cabinet.

 CHI. VALLABHBHAI,
 The more I think of it the more I am convinced that I should leave here as soon as the Kashmir affair is settled. I do not like much of what is going on. I do not say that for that reason it should be changed; but only that I should not be said to be associated with it. Moreover, I must reach Bihar and thence Noakhali before the 15th. That too is urgent work. I would request you not to detain me any more. There are still four or five days in any case.
 I even feel that Harijan should now be stopped. I do not like leading the country in an opposite direction. Please think over all this when you have time.

 Inciting the workers in this manner and making inflammatory speeches against the capitalists is not going to help. That will only lead to conflict and the economic problem will remain unsolved. Both the sides should adopt the method of reasoning and persuasion. Don’t you see that, at a time when the communal virus is spreading, by exploiting the situation and pouring abuse on the Congress you are not furthering your own cause? I hope the reports in the papers are false. Please let me know. Do remember that both the Congress and your party pursue the same goal, which is eradication of poverty in the country and peace and prosperity for all. But the methods are different. We are passing through such difficult times that if the country’s leaders and the people become divided into opposite camps, I don’t know what will be the fate of the country. Please think whether the words of experienced old man, who has trained you all like his sons, have any substance in them. If you think that they have, then I don’t at all wish to press you to join the Congress against your will but I do wish to suggest that you engage yourself in constructive activities like communal unity, etc. If you find no substance in what I have said, then tear up this letter.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,      NEW DELHI, July 	24, 1947 
  	As I have said/repeatedly, when one is at prayer or engaged in 	similar sacred activity one does not smoke. Christians drink  and 	smoke a good deal but I have never yet seen a Christian drinking or 	smoking when in a church. The same rule applies to mosques and 	gurudwaras. This place of course can be called a temple, a church or 	a mosque, since our prayer consists of texts taken from every 	religion. It would be good if you gave up smoking. Though I know 	that you are not going to do so on my asking you, still those who 	want to smoke can go out of the congregation and do so.  	Then some people get up and walk away while the prayer is still 	going on. It may be they do not find it interesting. But interesting 	or not, our purpose after all is to utter the name of God. The rule 	is that till the prayer is ended—and it is I who end it—no one 	should leave.  	The Charkha Sangh has a stock of old tri-colour flags valued at Rs. 	2 lakhs. The Charkha Sangh is an organization of very poor      24-7-1947. 
 people. I am its President. The people working in that organization are paid very little. They want to know what they are to do with the flags. There is not much difference between the new and the old flag except that the old one was a little more elegant. The old flag had the charkha. The new one has the wheel but not the spindle and the mal. The new flag does not render the old flag redundant. Even after the king is dead, the kingdom remains and old coins are not discarded for the new ones. When the new coins are issued old coins do not suffer any depreciation of value. Therefore, so long as there is even one old flag in stock at the Gandhi Ashram the two flags will have the same value. People who have old flags should not tear them up and if they want to buy more flags they should buy the same flags from the Gandhi Ashram so that Rs. 2 lakhs worth of goods are not wasted. Of course in future the Charkha Sangh will make flags only of the new design.
 I have two questions before me today. A correspondent wants to know what will happen to the Congress after August 15 and what its programme will be. He says that till now anyone wishing to join the Congress had to swear an oath that he would fight for the freedom of India through truthful and non-violent means. Now that freedom of India has been won he wants to know what the position will be.
 The Congress alone can tell what its programme will be. As a humble servant of the Congress I know that so long the task before us had been to fight foreign rule. We became rebels and we dislodged that rule. Outwardly we followed truth and non-violence. But inwardly there was violence in us. We practised hypocrisy and as a result we have to suffer the pain of mutual strife. Even today we are nurturing attitudes that will result in war and if this drift is not stopped we shall find ourselves in a conflict much more sanguinary than the Mutiny of 1857. India then did not have enough awakening and the mutiny was confined only to the sepoys. All that we did was to cut down Englishmen. In the end the British army overcame the mutineers. God forbid that the present strife should ever assume such dimensions. Therefore not only out of regard for truth and non-violence but also in the interest of the country, for which hundreds of thousands faced imprisonment and suffered hardships, I shall appeal to you not to prepare for warfare. For by so doing you will not only lose the country’s freedom but you will send it back into slavery. England,
 Russia, America or China—any of these countries may attack and enslave us. Do you, on the fifteenth of August, went to witness the spectacle of Hindus fighting Muslims and the Sikhs being crushed between the belligerents? I would rather that there was an earthquake and we all were crushed to death. Therefore since the  Congress  belongs to all India it should see to it that Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, and all the other communities are kept happy. I do not suggest that you should try to appease the Muslims or become cowards. I have never advocated cowardice. We should bravely pacify the people. This  should be the chief programme of the Congress.
 Although I have been President of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan twice it is my firm opinion that Hindi in Devanagari script can never become the national language of India. Today many of our leaders say that Gandhi talks nonsense. He is always out to appease the Muslims. Jinnah Saheb, however, while talking of two nations had accused me of wiping out Urdu. Thus today I am regarded as an enemy of both the languages. But I want to remain a friend of both. My claim that if there is any true friend of India, it is Gandhi, will be vindicated in the eyes of God. I can even today point out so many Hindus who neither know Hindi nor can write In Devanagari. We will have to adopt a language which is a mixture of Hindi and Urdu as the national language if Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Sikhs are to live here. I have no doubt that the language you speak can become a great language.
 An Indonesian leader Sjahrir is on a visit here. He will meet Jawaharlal Nehru and Mr. Jinnah. India can give Indonesia its moral support which will be more effective than any military aid.
 An Englishman says in a letter that now that India has been partitioned it will no longer have the status of a great nation. I do not agree, provided the two parts remain friendly with each other.

Is there no other language than English for our work? 	Oh! what culture, what convenience!libtech_183_footnote  From 	Hindi: C.W. 10265. Courtesy: Purushottam Prasad     HINDI v. HINDUSTANI  Shrimati 	Perinbehn Captain writes :libtech_184_footnote  It 	was with shame, disgust and sorrow that I heard on the Delhi radio 	that our own group of men wished to dethrone our national language. 	. . Please write to me fully what you would like: (1) our Hindustani 	Committee to do, (2)         
 our honest and self-sacrificing Hindustani pracharaks to do, and (3) last but not least, those of our countrymen—Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Christians and Jews, who have accepted and loved Hindustani as understood by the Congress resolution, to do . . .
 Please try and prevent our friends from losing their vision through hatred and thereby losing all hopes of linking in true friendship and love the whole country from Kashmir to Kanya Kumari and Assam to Sind.
 This represents the common grief of many nationalists like her, labelled congressmen or not. Since this letter was written the threat has been postponed for two months or until such time as the Constituent Assembly meets again. It is a wise postponement which gives time for passions to cool down in order to allow clear thinking.
 Let the Hindu, by their conduct, direct or indirect, disprove the Muslim League statement that we, the Hindus and the Muslims of India, are not one nation but two and that too because  of our respective religions. Congressmen have declared from the very inception of the Congress that India is one nation composed of men belonging to all religions and sects known in the whole world and it has proved the claim often enough at crucial moments in spite of many lapses which it would be easy to fling in its face.
 Dadabhai Naoroji, whose grand-daughter has written the above letter with so much feeling, has become and still remains the only Grand Old Man of India.
 Pherozeshah Mehta became the uncrowned king of the Bombay Presidency and after Dadabhai Naoroji’s death ruled the Congress by right of service unselfishly rendered.
 Who was Badruddin Tyabjee—at one time President of the Congress? Was he not a Mussalman every inch of him? Was he any the less an Indian? India has many religions but only one nationality and this, I dare to say, in spite of its two divisions. They may persist for a long time, but we must not be enemies one of the other for a single minute. It takes two to make a quarrel, but friendship does not require reciprocity. That which requires reciprocity is a bargain. This friendship, otherwise called love or non-violence, belongs not to the cowardly but to the brave and the seeing.
 I entirely endorse Perinbehn’s remark that not Hindi, highly Sanskritized written in the Nagari characters, nor Urdu, highly Persianized written in the Urdu characters, can even be  the  link between two or more communities in India. It can only be Hindustani
 
 which is a fusion of the two forms robbed of their artificial character and written either in the Nagari or the Urdu characters. This natural fusion has been going on for many years and like all natural  processes, it has been slow but nonetheless sure. It does not matter to me whether any Muslim brother reciprocates or not, by trying to understand my form of speech or writing, but surely I am richer for endeavouring to understand his form of speech and writing. Speaking to many Muslim divines I have not found it difficult to explain my meaning through Hindustani, though I have never  attempted  to pretend to speak their high-flown Persianized Urdu. They have as a rule been the losers and I invariably the gainer. What is true of me is true, I am sure, of many more.
Now about her main questions:
 Every member of the Hindustani Committee is to live up to his creed, that is to say, he or she should himself or herself master both the scripts and be familiar with a mixture of the two forms, Hindi and Urdu. This will happen when both are diligently studied  in  their simple forms. And when this first requisite is fulfilled, he or she must try to induce others to acquire the knowledge.
 Secondly, if the Hindustani pracharaks are honest  and sacrificing they are bound to infect their surroundings with the spirit that actuates them.
 Thirdly, those who have accepted Hindustani as the national language of the whole of India and love it, have to prove their acceptance by speaking and writing only in Hindustani, when it is meant for those who do not know the mother tongue. Thus a Tamilian will speak only in Tamil to a fellow Tamilian, but with a non-Tamilian he will make use of Hindustani and not English as is now the wont.

  SCHEDULED CASTES 
 A correspondent writes:
 If the Scheduled Castes of x area are included in Pakistan, they would probably have no alternative other than embracing Islam.
The  correspondent  is  well  educated   and   is   an   M.L.A. The
 question immediately arises as to what will happen to the Scheduled Caste  member  in  the   Pakistan   areas  where  they  are   not  living  in
 contiguous areas. Will they all have to embrace Islam? I can only say that their religion must be very poor stuff if it admits of change like one’s clothes. Religion (binding faith)‚ is made of sterner stuff; it is a deep personal matter, more personal than honour. To be true, it must be able to defy coercion of the extremest type.
 So much for those who are in fear of compulsory conversion. But what about those who inspire men and women with such fear? I have heard it seriously argued that people have often mistaken voluntary for compulsory conversion. I think the argument does not carry any conviction. People have been known in all ages to resort to conversion when they have known their friends,  relations  or neighbours to profess conversion under duress. When, therefore, there is suspicion all round, conversion should be stopped altogether. Here I remind myself of the argument of the correspondent used only the other day that my ‘brave’ words about personal religion would be all right if they were confined to sannyasis but not to householders who were exposed to a variety of temptations from life. Though I do not endorse this argument, for it weakens those on whose behalf it is led, I cannot help feeling that there is considerable force in it, especially when it is made applicable to members of the Scheduled Castes who have been ill-treated by their fellow Hindus and would, therefore, yield to compulsion in the hope of avoiding ill-treatment from their fellows who arrogate to themselves superiority, falsely so-called. Frequently this compulsion assumes subtle forms, as for instance, free grants of land or offer of service even beyond merit.

If the strength of resolution is rooted in the heart, it will not yield or submit to any amount of force or coercion.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,      NEW DELHI, July 	25, 1947 
  	Rajendra Babu tells me that he has received some 50,000 postcards, 	between 25‚000 and 30‚000 letters and many thousands of 	telegrams demanding a ban on cow-slaughter. I spoke to you about 	this before. Why this flood of telegrams and letters? They have had 	no effect. I have another telegram which says that a friend has 	started a fast for this cause. In India no law can be made to ban 	cow-slaughter.  I do not doubt that Hindus are forbidden the 	slaughter of cows. I have been long pledged to serve the cow but how 	can my religion also be 
 the religion of the rest of the Indians? It will mean coercion against those Indians who are not Hindus. We have been shouting from the house-tops that there will be no coercion in the matter of religion. We have been reciting verses from the Koran at the prayer. But if anyone were to force me to recite these verses I would not like it. How can I force anyone not to slaughter cows unless he is himself so disposed? It is not as if there were only Hindu in the Indian Union. There are Muslims, Parsis, Christians and other religious groups here. The assumption of the Hindus that India now has become the land of the Hindus is erroneous. India belongs to all who live here. If we stop cow-slaughter by law here and the very reverse happens in Pakistan, what will be the result? Supposing they say Hindus would not be allowed to visit temples because it was against Shariat to worship idols? I see God even in a stone but how do I harm others by this belief? If therefore I am stopped from visiting temples I would still visit them. I shall therefore suggest that these telegrams and letters should cease. It is not proper to waste money on them.
 Besides some prosperous Hindus themselves encourage cow- slaughter. They do not do it with their own hands. But who sends all the cows to Australia and other countries where they are slaughtered and whence shoes manufactured from cow- hide are sent back to India? I know an orthodox Vaishnava Hindu. He used to feed this children on beef soup. On my asking him why he did that he said there was no sin in consuming beef as medicine. We really do not stop to think what true religion is and merely go about shouting that cow- slaughter should be banned by law. In villages Hindus make bullocks carry huge burdens which almost crush the animals. Is it not cow- slaughter, albeit slowly carried out? I shall therefore suggest that the matter should not be pressed in the Constituent Assembly.
 Where trees are in abundance, rainfall too is abundant. The foliage in a forest attracts precipitation from clouds like milk from the udder of a cow. It is a law of nature that where there are no trees there is no rainfall and the land soon becomes a desert. I spent many years in Johannesburg. The climate there is very salubrious. After they planted trees there, rainfall too has been favourable. Therefore the programme of tree-planting that the authorities in Delhi have started is a very good thing. Those who have no spare patch of ground can still
 grow vegetables in earthen pots.
 I have been asked, ‘Since in view of the atrocities being perpetuated by Muslims it is difficult to decide which of the Mus- lims are to be trusted, what should be our attitude towards the Muslims in the Indian Union? What should the non-Muslims in Pakistan do?’
 I have already answered this question. I again repeat that all the religions of India today are being put to the test. It has to be seen how the various religious groups such as the Sikhs, the  Hindus,  the  Muslims and the Christians conduct themselves and how they carry on the affairs of India. Pakistan may be said to belong to Muslims but the Indian Union belongs to all. If you shake off cowardice and become brave you will not have to consider how you are to behave towards the Muslims. But today there is cowardice in us. For this I have already accepted the blame. I am still wondering how my 30 years’ teaching has been so ineffective. Why did I assume, to begin with, that non- violence could be a weapon of cowards? Even now if we can really become brave and love the Muslims, the Muslims will have to stop and think what they could gain by practising treachery against us. They will return love for love. Can we keep the crores of Muslims in the Indian Union as slaves? He who makes slaves of others himself becomes a slave. If we answer sword with sword, the lathi with lathi and kick with kick, we cannot expect that things will be different in Pakistan. We shall then lose our freedom as easily as we have gained it.
 I like the statement that has been issued on behalf of the future Governments of India and Pakistan. But I wish to see it implemented. However, we cannot assume that they will not do in Pakistan what the statement says. To assume this will mean preparing for war. The two armies will confront each other and the two-nation theory of Mr. Jinnah will have been proved true. I pray to God that He may not let us drift into such a situation.

  DISCUSSION WITH A CONGRESSMANlibtech_187_footnote 
 NEW DELHI,
 [Before July 26, 1947]libtech_188_footnoteA Congressman came to Gandhiji the other day asking him how he would reorganize the Congress under the new set-up. Gandhiji was emphatic that if the
 Congress was to live as a potent force, it must become a body of constructive workers. Constructive work, he knew, had never been over-popular. He thought that it was never more necessary than now. Without the backing of constructive work and penetrating the villages, their legislators would practically be idle and the voters would be exposed to the machinations of the vote-catchers. The labour vote would presently be a drop in the ocean in the face of adult suffrage both for men and women.  It was probably the boldest experiment known to the world on a vast scale. Unless it was well planned and all attendant dangers anticipated and provided against, adult suffrage might well prove a deluge drowning the whole country. He (Gandhiji) knew nothing so effective for the purpose as a well-thought-out constructive programme.

  A LETTER 
 July 26, 1947
 I have your letter. If a man believes that a peepul tree is haunted by a ghost, he will not get rid of his fear by going to the tree again and again. Only if he visits the tree several times in the company of a person who does not share his fear and nothing happens to him, will his fear go. This can happen in the case of brahmacharya only if a man of conventional ideas lives in the company of a perfect brahmachari from time to time. But then, how are we to find such a brahmachari? And who will accept such a claim by anybody?
 The example of the peepul tree and the ghost is applicable only up to a certain point. I hope you know that I have never claimed that I am a perfect brahmachari.
 When shall I know that state supreme, When will the knots outer and inner snap?
 I write this for a seeker. Just now it is not germane to go further than this. If the seeker finds his path, it might be pertinent to go further.
 I have no doubt that if the Congress wishes to preserve its strength, it must vigorously pursue the constructive programme.
 You worry about me from your sick-bed. But there is One who worries about you and me and everybody else; why don’t you leave everything to that Almighty? And if I am destined to give still more service, nothing will happen to me. For you, prayer is the only unfailing remedy.

  LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL 
 VALMIKI  MANDIR,
 NEW DELHI,
 July 26, 1947
 CHI. VALLABHBHAI,
 Two Khaksars came to see me yesterday. One of them wept bitterly. The other complained that although an official had assured them that now nothing would be done to them since they were going away, yet there was firing in the mosque the same evening, that many were killed, that an old man of seventy received seven bullets, that no one knew how many had died and how many had survived and that for three days the Khaksars were kept there without food and water, unable even to go out to answer calls of nature.
 I was stunned to hear all this. I rebuked them. I said it could not be true. I said, “Sardar told me only today that since the Khaksars would not leave the mosque police officials had to enter the mosque, that they did so with the permission of the Imam, that the action that was taken was ordered by the Muslim officer, that no violence had been used, nothing beyond tear-gas had been fired and that no one had been killed. I therefore cannot swallow what you say.” They answered, “If that is what your Sardar says, how can we hope to be believed? What use asking for justice now? One day you will know. Truth will be out.” I said, “If I hear of a wrong being done I do not hide it even for the sake of my dear ones. I shall say no more. I will do my duty.” Now if there is anything in this please let me know.libtech_191_footnote

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       NEW 	DELHI, 
      BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  July 	26, 1947 
  	I personally feel that a barrister and a scavenger should get equal 	wages. But it is easier said than done. And it is not something that 	can be accomplished through strikes. We should for the time being 	accept and assimilate the rise in salaries recommended by the Pay 	Commissionlibtech_195_footnotelibtech_196_footnoteand then proceed to build   up  public  opinion  in 	favour of the principle of equality of wages. Strikes too are 	governed by a logic. Nothing is gained by indiscriminate strikes. 	Today unfortunately strikes are sweeping the country. There are 	strikes even where people have their own governments. I think that 	under British rule we did not have so many strikes. Today I have 	received  a  telegram from Calcutta and I also see from newspapers 	that the employees of the Accountant-General’s office have gone on 	a pen- down strike. The strike includes the employees of the Post 	and Telegraph department which operates not for the good of any 	particular individual but for the good of the community. It is true 	that it has some big officers getting huge salaries and it is unjust 	that the members of the subordinate staff should be paid such low 	salaries. Why should the difference in salaries be so great as it 	is? This was started by the British and we liked it and continued 	it. But if people    
 were to put down their pens, what would become of India? If through strikes they bring about a little rise in salaries it would not be a great thing. The method is wrong and is harmful to the  country.  The present plight of India brings to my mind the story of the goose that laid golden eggs. The owner of the goose wishing to have all the eggs at once killed her. As a result not only did he get no more eggs but he lost the goose as well. The administration that has come into our hands in somewhat like that goose. If we want to get out of it all the eggs together it will surely die and so shall we.
 Strikes as I have said have a logic. I first tried the weapon of strikes in South Africa. Indians there were treated as coolies. Strikes had then a meaning because they had no other way of making themselves heard. Therefore anyone who knows anything  about strikes will only say to the strikers everywhere that the path they have chosen will be their own undoing. India has already been partitioned and if the strikes continue God alone knows what will become of India. It is our duty quietly to go on doing the work that we have been doing. As a result of the recommendations of the Pay Commission the emoluments of the low-paid employees have been considerably raised. If you go on demanding more and more India will go  bankrupt. It is true that the Government receives crores of rupees in revenue but that money cannot be spent for the benefit of only a handful of people. The largest share should go to the villagers from whom it comes.
 Recently there has been a workers’ strike in Bombay. The Government there had already given one or two crores of rupees to the workers, but they were not satisfied and in order to show their strength resorted to a token strike. What they ought to have done was to accept what they had been given and set about cultivating public opinion in their favour. But they chose the way of strike.  The Congress itself has become did into many factions and I am told that one of the factions was behind the strike. These token strikes, even if they last only a couple of hours, show a kind of arrogance. The party organizing such a strike seeks thereby to demonstrate its hold on the workers. What purpose otherwise can such a strike serve? The country can gain nothing from such strikes. Therefore what the workers of Bombay did seems to me wrong.
 Must we destroy ourselves through such strikes? The motive behind them is not service of the country but selfishness pure and
 simple. The British have hardly left the country. The reins of the Government have hardly come in our hands and we have started fighting over money. I hold in principle that a barrister and a scavenger should receive equal payment. But a barrister is able to snatch more and we gladly let him. I too was once a barrister but I found the idea of thus making money repugnant and I became a Bhangi. But where are we to find men who will have the talent to work as Governors, barristers, traders and the like? And who will be satisfied with the e wages of a scavenger? Even a tailor is able to earn four or five rupees a day. But who will pay a scavenger that much? The need today is for man to change his nature, to cultivate generosity and not to cut other people’s throats to further his self-interest. If the assassinations in Burma cannot teach us a lesson, then what is going to be the plight of India and the world?

  DISCUSSION WITH AN AMERICAN PACIFISTlibtech_197_footnote 
 NEW DELHI,
 [Before  July  27,  1947]libtech_198_footnoteA young American pacifist came to see Gandhiji some days ago. He had brought a note of introduction from Miss Muriel Lester. He told Gandhiji how she had
 carried the message of peace to young Americans during the war and explained to them why they should stay out of the war. He asked Gandhiji how young American pacifists should behave today.
 Gandhiji’s reply was that they should behave as they would if the war was still going on. Even if they are a few individuals, they should not hesitate to do the right thing. The few would multiply into many.
 The Friend was eloquent about Miss Lester. He had great admiration for her. He thought she was one of the greatest women. Gandhiji said:
 She herself would contradict it. There are many great women, but few good women. If you had said that she was a very good woman, you would have been right. A true pacifist’s language must
 
 
 
 be correct and thought exact. If you want to play your part effectively in this movement against war, you have to model your life accordingly. The movement against war is intrinsically sound. No one can question the value of peace. Yet it has not made enough headway. The fault lies with the pacifists.
 The friend turned back to what Gandhiji called inexact language on his part because he had described Miss Lester as one of the greatest women. He said he had called her great because she was good.
 Gandhiji retorted that he never knew that goodness and greatness were synonymous terms. A man might be great, yet not good.

  THE NATIONAL FLAGlibtech_199_footnote 
 The National Flag has been in existence since 1921. Those who say that what was so far the Congress Flag has now become the National Flag of India make a meaningless fuss and at the same time insult the Congress. The Congress has been national from its very inception. It has never been sectional. It embraces all sections and all Indians. Of course, it is open to the Congress to become sectional and commit suicide. If God’s wrath descends upon it the calamity may well overtake it. Nevertheless, many will be praying that such a misfortune may not overtake it. Is it possible that Jinnah’s jibe that the Congress is national only in name but Hindu in action, will be proved just?
 Here, however, we shall confine ourselves to the Flag. What has happened is that, having acquiesced in the division of India, the Congress has nevertheless delivered it from the British domination and has taken over the larger part. Therefore, the flag under which the Congress has fought so many non-violent battles will now be the flag of the Government of free India. I see no haughtiness in this. The joy that one finds in climbing the Himalayas, the views one sees, are not to be had on reaching the top. The pleasure lies in the journey, not in arriving at the destination. Similarly the pleasure that it gave us to fight under the National Flag has now come to an end.
 I have just reread an article I wrote for Young India of April 13, 1921. I advise the reader to glance through that article. It is
 
 reproduced in this issue. The modified Flag has value only if it carries the significance attached to it. If it does not, it is to me valueless.
 There is reason for this caution. Some say that the original flag has gone, that a new age has begun and with it have come new ways, and that the flag will be one to befit this new age. I have not known   a worthy son to whom his mother appeared ugly. It may be possible to gild pure gold, but who can make his mother more beautiful? Hence, in my opinion nothing would have been lost if no changes had been made in the original flag. People are saying ‘the charkha was old women’s solace and Gandhi’s toy; but swaraj is not for old women. It is for the warrior and we therefore want the Asoka emblem with lions and if the lions do not find a place on the flag, it is merely for artistic consi-derations: they cannot be reproduced on cloth. But the lions must feature somewhere or other. We have had enough of cowardliness. Nobody has yet had the experience of the non-violence of the brave. We shall talk about it when we see it. It is the lion who is the king of the forest. Sheep and goats are his food. We are tired of wearing khadi. Now we shall wear clothes made of glass. Our forefathers used cloth to cover themselves. We wear clothes to adorn ourselves. Clothing therefore should be such as will show to advantage every limb of the body. The improved flag has no need of khadi. We do not want to disfigure with khadi the shop windows of our towns. The poor in the villages may by all means wear khadi. We shall not treat it as an offence. Old women in their huts may spin away on the charkha. In this new age this should be considered a favour.’
 I will refuse to salute the flag that is modified on the above lines however artistic it may appear.
 Happily there is the other side which says: ‘The new flag is merely an improved design of the original. The spinning-wheel continues on it. That it is without the spindle and the mal, is a failing of art. A picture after all is only a picture. It always leaves something for the imagination. The spinning-wheel in a picture has no slivers and no spinners at work on it. These are left for the imagination to fill in. This rule applies as well to the improved design of the flag. Thus conceived, the improve-ment must appear innocent.  This  tricolour flag with the wheel will certainly consist of hand-spun and hand- woven khadi. Our country has called it khadi whether it is woven from hand-spun cotton or silk. When the original conception is kept intact
 
 there is no harm in making a conce-ssion to art. When the country was at war with a foreign power, art lay in being engaged in the battle. Now that it has ended in success, art must have  a place,  though perhaps, a subordinate one. Otherwise we shall not be able  to perpetuate the memory of the struggle.’ This is another interpretation. If any further interpretations not inconsistent  with  this  are added I see no harm in it. One may see some other subtle meaning in the same three colours. Those who see unity in the diversity of the universe may find it in the three colours. Looking at the wheel some
may recall that Prince of Peace, King   Asoka, ruler of an empire,  who
 renounced power. He represented all faiths; he was an embodiment of compassion. Seeing the charkha in his chakra adds to the glory of the Charkha. Asoka’s chakra represents eternally revolving Divine Law of ahimsa.

  	You are quite right. I can do nothing in a matter such a this. To 	the innocent, punishment is like a reward, and the guilty repays a 	part of his debt through it. Both, therefore, should shed fear and 	appear in the court without any lawyers. I will go through the 	draft. If God requires my services. He will let me live not a 	hundred and twenty- five but a hundred and fifty years, and if He 	doesn’t require them any longer He may take me away even today. 	One must live as Rama bids.

Desai     A LETTER   July 	27, 1947  	It is a great mistake for a man to believe that he is always right 	and others are always wrong. Nothing in the world is wholly perfect 	and nothing wholly imperfect. Nothing is wholly good or wholly bad. 	It is we who think things to be perfect or imperfect, good or bad. 	How  I wish you would learn to look at things in this way.  	I shall most probably leave Delhi at the end of this month. Where I 	go will be decided tomorrow. I must reach Noakhali on August 15. But 	everything rests in the hands of God. libtech_201_footnote  	If we do not pay vigilant attention to the villages, I do not know 	what will happen. After all, how many prosperous cities and towns 	are there in India? No more than can be counted on one’s fingers. 	They do not make the country prosperous and happy. India means her  
 seven hundred thousand villages. If there was but one worker  selflessly working in each village, then in a year’s time India’s face would be transformed. But unfortunately “a worker” has now come to mean something exactly the opposite of this. I can see from the letters that I receive that a kind of reaction has set in among the workers. Without dwelling further on this point, let us hope that everybody will work with God as witness. I am quite well. Chi. Manudi also has improved a little, though not quite as much as one would wish. Probably we shall go to Kashmir and I hope that she will benefit from the magic climate there and improve during the two days’ visit. Here is Rajendra Babu coming, and I am also being reminded by Lady Watch that it is time for my walk. So I obey her and stop here.
 Blessings to you all from

  A TALK TO VISITORSlibtech_202_footnote 
 NEW DELHI,
 July  27,  1947
 That is what I say. We shall have to give the country a different lead. For this we shall have to train a whole army of workers. Their sole concern should be to mix with the people, familiarize themselves with their hardships and make them understand that now the country is theirs and the Ministers are people elected by them. It is an insult to the people rather than the Ministers if there are such demonstrations. However, if there is injustice done to the people, they can take the Minister concerned by the ear and remove him. We should now cultivate that kind of power. The Ministers are there not to rule over the people but to serve them. I gave the same advice to the Socialists. But even a person like …libtech_203_footnotelibtech_204_footnotedoes not understand. I do hope to convince
 
 
 him though. The Congress should forget its struggle against  the British and launch a movement to educate the public in democracy. We had gained one thing in our struggle against the British and that was that we could speak with one voice and say to the British that they must quit India. There was none in India who said: ‘Let them stay’… Similarly we must now say with one voice that we shall make our country prosperous, we shall not let even a single person go unfed and unclothed, we shall make our lives lofty, peaceful and happy. We should be prepared to make any sacrifices necessary to that end. In our struggle against the British we risked our lives. Thousands of people died. But that will not be so in our new movement. The only thing that will be wanted is that the rich should give of their riches. But the method of extracting money from them will not be the one suggested by the Socialists and Communists like Lohia, Ramgopal and others. Their method will lead to the moral and economic degradation of the labourers rather than that of the capitalists. Poor workers are like the sheep. They follow whichever way they are led. If they take to the ways of duplicity, destruction, plunder, it will be difficult to bring them to the right path. Besides, if they continue going on strike, they will go without wages. It is solely out of a desire for cheap leadership that these so-called leaders have brought the working class under their influence.

   MESSAGE TO ARMY OFFICERS       NEW 	DELHI, 
  July 	 27,  1947  	I have only one message for you. You have got your guns and 	sten-guns and you are proficient in killing men and all living 	things. Instead of that you should learn the art of using the 	sickle, ploughing the land and producing the food necessary for men 	and other living beings. Forget violence and gain proficiency in 	non-violence. Maybe from this you will think that I have gone mad. 	But look at the way Capt. Shahnawaz and Col. Jiwansingh live and 	work today. They have ceased to be army officers and have become 	public servants and farmers. Thus they have become more powerful. 	They are themselves happy and have made people happy. One of them is 	a Muslim and is 
 doing wonderful work in Bihar. The other, in spite of being a Punjabi and orthodox Sikh, has identified himself with the Muslims of Noakhali. I mention just these two names because I happen to remember them. But many such persons have come to me. They have changed their lives and have become happy. Such a time is now coming. You note down in your diary that the world will curse the scientist who has made the atom bomb. People have wearied of bloodshed. They would like to follow the path of non-violence and peace. India alone can give a lesson in that. America has great riches. Even other countries have more money than we have. Because they have money, they are investing in devices of mass destruction. That is why our scriptures and the Gita teach us not to hoard wealth. The right way of becoming happy is the observance of truth, non-violence, non-hoarding, celibacy, non-stealing and physical labour. This is as true as a geometrical theorem. Our army will lead the world if it adopts non-violence instead of violence.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       NEW 	DELHI, 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  July 	27, 1947 
  	There are more than 800 princely States in India. Some of them are 	very large and some very small. Recently the Viceroy had summoned 	the Princes to Delhi. So long the States had functioned under the 	protective umbrella of the British Empire which has now been taken 	away. The Viceroy spoke to them in very gentle terms. I liked his 	speech. He advised these rulers that they should all opt for either 	India or Pakistan. His speech was not a brief one. What hurt me was 	that in his lengthy address there was not even a mention of the 	States’ people. The relationship of the British Government was 	with the rulers of the States. The subjects of the States did not 	figure anywhere. Therefore, when paramountcy lapses these States 	legally become independent and the British Government cannot 	interfere, but after all the rulers have certain duties and 	obligations. The States’ subjects can no longer be ruled at the 	point of the bayonet. But the security they have under the British 	protection is no longer there. 
 Take some large State—Cochin, for instance. It has an extensive sea coast. It cannot enter into treaty relations with the whole world in order to ensure its security and it was the duty of the Viceroy to point this out. I would have been happy if he had somewhere in his speech also mentioned the States’ People. Since I was born in a Kathiawar State as a subject I have a right to say something about this question. Formerly if a ruler wanted so much as to employ a Dewan he had to seek permission from the Viceroy. They certainly did not like this. If, therefore, they now have been deprived of British protection, they are also free of British pressure. But there is now pressure from their people. So, if the rulers want to stay as rulers, they can only do so as servants of their people. They should seek the advice and  co- operation of their Prajaman-dals in the work of administration. It is true that the Prajamandals have no experience of administration. But then even the leaders of the Central Government have had no previous experience of administration. This does not mean that the rulers should nominate twenty or twenty-five persons and call them Prajamandal. They should do whatever they do with sinceri-ty. So far as the question of their joining Pakistan or the Indian Union is concerned, regard will have to be paid to the geographical situation. A State in Gujarat or Kathiawar cannot unite itself with Bengal. The States thus cannot free themselves from the constraints of geography.
 It is curious that the British have not said that the paramountcy which they had so long exercised now vests in India and Pakistan. This has complicated the problem both for India and Pakistan. I must say that the rulers are now on their trial. They may remain rulers but they must be servants of the people in fact.
 I am saying this not because the Viceroy has complained to me about the rulers or that Jawaharlal or Rajendra Babu have said anything to me. The fact is that people are now watching what the Indian Government and Pakistan Government will do?
 But what is the plight of the States’ People? Are they happy at the thought of the coming freedom? Will they celebrate the day of independence? As for me I shall fast on the day and my prayer will be: ‘O God, now that India is free do not destroy her.’
 The States form one-fourth of the area of the country. Will the 10 crore subjects of the States celebrate August 15 as Independence Day? If the Princes declare that they will from now on be servants of their people, then all will be well. Then the taxes they raise from the
 people will be for the uplift of the people. They will return their revenue ten times over not in the form of money but in the form of schools, hospitals, roads, gardens and public parks.
 Jawaharlal and Sardar Patel have made no comment on the speech of the Viceroy though they could not be very happy in their hearts. But why should we have any poison in our hearts ? It is like a game in which all one’s cards must be placed on the table. Only when there is no poison in our hearts can we genuinely celebrate August 15 as Independence Day.

I hope you know that you 	can free yourself from my discipline whenever you wish. That means 	that you are free to go back on your promise.

  	I have your letter. I have gone through Kishorelal’s letter. I 	understand Manilal’s view. I prefer mine. If Sita were to marry 	today, she would not have my blessings. The world endures through 	vows. If I had not taken a vow before my mother, today I would be a 	drink- addict, a meat-eater and a lecher. If I was saved from these 	three vices, the credit goes to the vow. And I had not taken the vow 	of my own free will, but at my mother’s instance and through my 	eagerness to go to England.  	But in this case you are the mother and Manilal is the father, and I 	admit that the father and the mother know better  than  the 	grandfather. Therefore, what you two advise will be best. If you 	leave the decision to me, I shall not be able to take any other 	view. I send herewith the letter which I received from Sita today. I 	have repliedlibtech_213_footnotelibtech_214_footnoteto her. I think she will send the letter to you. I 	should be happy if you could come to some definite decision.

      	[From Gujarati]  Bapuna 	Patro-2: Sardar Vallabhbhaine, p. 	358     SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS, I 	shall answer some questions today.  Blessings 	from  BAPU            NEW DELHI,  July 	28, 1947 
  Q. After 15th of August 	will there be two Congress organizations in the two countries or 	only one or would there be no Congress at all ?  A. I think then the need 	for an organization like the Congress will be still greater. Its 	programme will no doubt be altered. If the    
 Congress does not foolishly accept the two-nation theory, there will be only one Congress in the whole country. The partition of India does not and should not mean the partition of the Congress. The partition of India into two sovereign States does not mean that India is two nations. Sup- posing one or more Princely States kept out of the Union, would the Congress turn their representatives out of the Congress ? Would the States’ people not expect it to take even greater interest in their welfare ? Of course the problems that this will create will be even more complicated and some of them will be more difficult of solution, but there still will be no reason for the Congress to be broken up into two. It will require greater political acumen, greater depth of thought and much more patient deliberation and decision. We must not anticipate incapacitating difficulties.
 Q.  Will the Congress now become a communal organization ?  A demand is being vociferously raised that since the Muslims now consider themselves a separate nation, we too should candidly call ourselves Hindu India and place upon the country the deep imprint of Hinduism ?
 A. The question betrays sheer ignorance. The Congress can  never become an organization of the Hindus. Those who seek to make it such will be doing great harm to India and Hinduism. India is the country of the millions but their voice is not heard. It is only the vociferous sections living in cities who talk of two nations. We should not mistake their voice for the voice of the millions.
 Then it must be remembered that Muslims in the Indian Union have not said that they are not Indians and Hinduism with all its shortcomings has never encouraged separation. People professing different religions have mingled to form the Indian nation and they are all citizens of India and no section has the right to oppress another section. The power derived from the sword or from numbers is not real power. Truth is real power.
 Q. What attitude should non-Muslims  adopt  towards  the Pakistan flag!
 A. The Pakistan flag for the time being will be the Muslim League’s flag. If the Muslim League represents Islam then the Muslims all over the world should have one flag and those who are not hostile to Islam should respect that flag. I do not know the flags of Islam, Hinduism, Christianity or of any other religion. And if I have not made a deep study of Islam, I can be mistaken about its flag. If the flag of Pakistan, whatever its colour, represents all the people
 living in Pakistan then I shall salute that flag and so shall you. In other words the two Dominions cannot become enemies of each other. I am watching with much interest and more fear what attitude the Dominion of South Africa adopts towards India. Can the people of South Africa hate the people of India ? Will the South African Whites still refuse to travel with Indians in the same compartments?

  	You must not assume the entire responsibility for Pushpa. In fact 	you ought not to assume any. You are under my discipline. You 	should, therefore, assume only as much of that responsibility as I 	entrust to you. In doing that lies your good, as also mine, and that 	of Pushpa and of the Ashram too. It is indeed a good thing that you 	have lost the capacity to judge people. There was a time when you 	possessed it in good measure. But you were more inclined to see the 	defects of men and of institutions. You know the results of doing 	that. And so you became a sannyasi, wandered about and 	submitted yourself to a great many hardships. And now you are back 	where you were. I see nothing but God’s hand in this. I think it 	will be best for you to assume no responsibility not entrusted to 	you by me. That is your real dharma and only by acting in that way 	can you keep a watch on the Ashram. I have also explained to you the 	meaning of keeping  a  watch.libtech_223_footnotelibtech_224_footnoteIt 	 means  that  you  should  maintain  the   highest standard of 	purity in your own conduct so that everybody else may look upon you 	as the ideal to be followed. I know  of  no  better method of 	keeping a watch. To notice and point at people’s defects does not 	mean keeping a watch. You are sometimes swayed  by emotion and act 	thoughtlessly. I heard that you undertook a fast once again. There 	was no need at all to do that. To permit Pushpa to slacken in the 	least degree in the observance of rules will  be tantamount to 	betraying her. It was I who admitted her to the Ashram at some risk. 	I pained her parents by doing that. She has  not  succeeded in 	becoming a perfect devotee. She has realized that she is far away 	from that sublime state. But her wilfulness …libtech_225_footnotelibtech_226_footnotehave 	not yet vanished. She has still not realized the importance of 	abiding by the rules. You should, therefore, humbly renounce your 	claim to be Pushpa’s elder brother or father or guardian. She must 	observe the Ashram rules with the utmost punctiliousness and become 	one with it       
 as sugar becomes one with milk. Till she merits such a certificate, I shall not be relieved of my worry on her account. I owe a responsibility to her parents. Even if her renunciation in giving up her intention to marry the person whom she wished to marry was not the result of selfishness or wilfulness, she has yet to demonstrate that it was an act of supreme self-abnegation. I don’t have to explain this to you.

 I hope you don’t assume that you would understand better what is written in Gujarati if the same was written in English. But I know of many Parsi friends who have distorted their mother tongue to such an extent that they use it only at home and only in talking with the servants.

  A LETTER 
 July 29, 1947
 I have your letter of gentle rebuke and advice. It is true that I have got involved in too many things. But do not all the planets revolve round the sun? Similarly, all my activities revolve round the unity of India. And rest assured that either I shall die or this inhuman conduct of ours will cease. There is no third possibility.
 I am leaving for Kashmir the day after tomorrow. I shall not make any public speeches or address meetings there. The Viceroy also feels that in the present circumstances it would be better if I went rather than Jawaharlal. I shall be there for tw days, then reach Calcutta around the 8th and from there Noakhali on the 15th. But it will be as God ordains. You know that without His will not a leaf moves.

  A LETTER 
 July 29, 1947
 Anybody who wishes to serve always finds enough for  his  needs. He can indulge in no luxuries, of course. If, therefore, you wish to live in the Ashram for the sake of service, you should be content with whatever you get. Otherwise you should leave the Ashram and find a job. A person like you should have no difficulty in finding one. There is no third course open to a public servant.

     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  July 	29, 1947 
  	I have many important things to talk to you about today. I am told I 	should go to Kashmir. I am not particularly desirous of going there 	nor should I be. It is a beautiful place, hemmed in by Himalayan 	peaks. But there are many other beautiful places in the world and 	many other places of pilgrimage. I once did want to go to Kashmir.    
 The  Maharaja  of  Kashmir  had  invitedlibtech_234_footnoteme   and   Sir   Gopalaswami Ayyangar was his Prime Minister. But I can go to Kashmir only when God wills it.
 When some time ago Pandit Jawaharlal had been detained in Kashmirlibtech_235_footnotewe needed him here. Maulana Azad was the President of the Congress. He wanted to have Jawaharlal back from Kashmir. Lord Wavell also felt the need of Jawaharlal’s counsel and both Wavell and Maulana Saheb were worried. The Maulana then sent word to Jawaharlal that the mission he had undertaken was the mission of the Congress and as a matter of discipline he ought to return when the Congress wanted him to return. Jawaharlal agreed but he said that he would again be going to Kashmir. The Maulana said the matter could be taken up later and if necessary I could be sent there. I also told Jawaharlal that no one could prevent him from doing so later.
 Now the Government has changed, the Viceroy has changed.  I said I was prepared to go to Kashmir so that Jawaharlal might not be disturbed in what he was doing. But there were several complications and I said I would go if the Viceroy advised me to go. The Viceroy told melibtech_236_footnotelibtech_237_footnotethat  he  himself  was  going  to  Kashmir  and  that  I  might postpone my visit. So I did not go. And now the situation is such that either Jawaharlal or I should go to Kashmir. He cannot go. There is too much work for him here. Of course the climate of Kashmir is very good and, if he went there, he would gain in health. But there are also lots of problems there. If the head of the Interim Government makes a journey to Kashmir, it can be interpreted as an attempt on his part to make Kashmir accede to India. Therefore, it seems that it would be better for me to go.
 Kashmir has a Maharaja and also the subjects of the Maharaja. I am not going to suggest to the Maharaja to accede to India and not to Pakistan. This is not my intention. The real sovereign of the State are the people of the State. If the ruler is not a servant of the people then he is not the ruler. This is my belief and that is why I became a rebel because the British claimed to be the rulers of India and I refused to recognize them as rulers. Now they are about to leave
 
 India. Those who had come to rule have agreed to be servants. They now want to be servants in thought, word and deed. Mountbatten now will be Governor-General not because the King has so appointed him but because we, the Interim Government, want to make him the Governor-General. My idea was that a Harijan girl should be made the Governor-General. But I can see that under the present circumstances it is not possible because we have to negotiate with the Princes and attend to various other problems. Yes, when democratic rule is firmly established then it will be possible to do so.
 So long the Maharaja of Kashmir could do as he liked under the protection of the Viceroy. Now the power belongs to the people. I do not want that the Maharaja should be inconvenienced. The pandits and mullahs in Kashmir know me at least by name. I have given a lot of money to Kashmiris. In Kashmir, shawl-making, embroidery, etc., are well developed handicrafts. The charkha also has done good work there. The poor people of Kashmir know me.
 The people of Kashmir should be asked whether they want to join Pakistan or India. Let them do as they want. The ruler is nothing. The people are everything. The ruler will be dead one of these days but the people will remain. Some people wonder why I cannot say all this through correspondence. But that way I can do even Noakhali work through correspondence. I do not want to do anything in public when I am in Kashmir. I do not want even a public prayer, though I may have it, for prayer is part of my life.
 Now as for my advice  that  we  should  fast  and  pray  on August  15,  I  may  say  that   I   do  not   intend   to   mourn.   But   it is a matter of grief that we have no food and no clothes. Human beings kill human beings. In Lahore, people cannot leave their houses for fear that they will be killed. These are not the conditions in which we can rejoice and feast.
 On April 6, 1919, the whole of India had woken up. But there were no celebrations on the day. I told Hindus and Muslims and everybody to pray, fast and spin. There was no enmity between the Hindus and Muslims at that time and everyone celebrated the day by fasting. The excitement that was witnessed on that 6th of April is something that one may not witness again. Today it is  more  imperative for people to fast. Millions are starving. It was a time when even collecting a crore of rupees for the Tilak Swaraj Fund was difficult. We did not have the power in our hands. Today we have
 many crores of rupees in our hands. We shoulder a great responsibility. At such a time if we are not humble what will happen? If on August 15 we feast and gorge, what will Rajendra Babu do on August 16? What will he feed the people on? I shall, therefore, say that we must celebrate the day but by fasting, praying and spinning. Yes, we should not mourn.

Where  has  he   the 	time? How is it that all the memorial committees require big names? 	Has no memorial an independent importance of its own? If there is 	any intrinsic worth in Pali literature, some persons are bound to be 	attracted to it.  	I feel that we should do only as much as  the  Advisory Committee  	accepts.  Further  than  that  I   shall   not  be   able   to   go. 	I  remember  the  episode  about  Bhai  Prabhu.  The whole  of   it  	 was a painful affair. “In the very act of protesting innocence,” 	as the saying goes, “the man betrayed himself.” If he writes 	something to me, I will send it to Jiwanlal and then the path will 	be clear before him. I am now leaving Delhi. I am going to Kashmir. 	From there I will go to Patna and thence to Noakhali. If I reach 	Noakhali, a new life will take shape there. 
     [PS.]  Blessings 	from  BAPU   I showed 	to J. the papers which you sent to me regarding Goa. 
  	He said he had copies of those papers. Our representative in Goa 	sends him copies of all his dispatches. Let events take their own 	course now. Nobody should force Goa to join either this or the other 	part. For the present it will be enough if it joins the Indian 	Union. It seems    
 wants to grab things. You may give what guidance you can from there.

  A LETTER 
 July 30, 1947
 I am going to Kashmir. I am going only in order to see for myself the condition of the people. In any case I shall have a glimpse of the Himalayas. Who knows if I am going there for the first and the last time? I was very eager to go to Uttarkashi, but that does not seem possible now. libtech_239_footnote
 Money comes seeking a man who wants to do public service. The progress of any public work is never held up for want of funds. If it is held up, we should conclude that there is some deficiency in us. I have had many experiences in my life which illustrate this.
 Don’t you remember the example of Sabarmati? Maganlal and I were greatly worried, and then all at once a motor-car came up and stopped in front of the Ashram and a stranger placed a large wad of notes in my hands.
 Wasn’t that also the fate of Narasinh Mehta’s hundi? And isn’t the story of Draupadi’s garment similar? If, therefore, we put our trust in God and go on serving in a selfless spirit, our work will never be held up. . . .
 I know that the atmosphere in Noakhali is full of fear. But my workers are there and I am sure that they will lay down their lives before any Hindu can be killed. That, at any rate, is my hope.

  LETTER TO HARIBHAU UPADHYAYA 
 SEVAGRAM,libtech_240_footnote
 July  30, 1947
 BHAI HARIBHAU,
 I had no talk with Balkrishna apart from polite enquiries after his health and so on. Where was the time? I did tell him to see me at four but he did not want to say anything.
 I think I have replied to Kotwal. I do not in the least relish the idea of his going to jail in Ajmer. There is absolutely no need to come here. Why should he at all go to jail? Let him do whatever constructive work he can in Indore. If he does not get my letter, let him consider this as my reply to him.
 Mishrilal had lost much weight. Now he should take it easy. The same is the case with Kanaiyalal Khadiwala. Many useless persons went to the U.P. I know it.
 I was glad that you gave me news about Harilal. I am keeping fairly fit these days. You should think it a matter of duty to give yourself rest.
 We are waiting for the rains. If it does not rain, people will suffer.

 NEW DELHI,
 July  30,  1947
 BHAI HASAN libtech_241_footnote,
 I have had a talk with Shuklajilibtech_242_footnote. I find that you have lost the confidence of the others. Under the circumstances you had better resign from the Ministry without rancour and devote yourself to whatever other public service you can take up. This should not cause resentment. A ministry can work only with a homogeneous team. This is only my advice. Do as your inner voice prompts.
       From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal     SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING   Blessings 	from  BAPU          NEW 	DELHI, 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  July 	30, 1947 
  	This is my last day here. From tomorrow there  will  be  no prayer 	meeting.  Of  course,  if  you  gather  here  for  prayer,  it  will 	be good. But I shall not be present. If God grants I shall be in 	Shrinagar by day after tomorrow. As I said yesterday, I shall  be 	staying there for two or three days. I have no particular business 	to attend to. I am not going there to attend a public meeting. I am 	only going there to meet the people. I  shall  not  return  	empty-handed. But that is in the hands of God. I am only keeping a 	promise in going. After the promise is fulfilled I shall get away. 	From there I go to Noakhali.  	I have a letter from a Bihari Muslim saying that now in Bihar  	Hindus  and  Muslims  are  living  as  brothers.   Mr.   Ansarilibtech_243_footnote,  a Minister in Bihar, tells me that now there are no 	riots there. People are returning by special trains but they are not 	coming at the expense of      
 the Bihar Government. The Bihar Government is not sending them. The Bengalis had taken away people and it was for them to send them back. I shall advise the Bihar Hindus that they should accept the Muslims who are returning to Bihar. They should not depend on the Government. So long we have had to depend on the Government because power was not in our hands. Now that power is in our hands no one can say that the work has to be done by the Government. The country has been partitioned. I feel it was bad but bad or good it is now an accomplished fact. Pakistan in fact is nothing. Only the Government has been divided. This is all that I want to tell the Biharis.
 Now I want to say something about Bombay. The Bombay Government have decided that the salaries of its employees will be increased according to the recommendations of the Pay Commission. I  have  been  guilty  of  exaggeration.  I   had   saidlibtech_244_footnotethat   the   salaries had  already  been  increased.  As  a  matter   of   fact   this   has   not yet happened.  Still,  since  a  decision  has  been taken the  salaries will certainly be revised. Why then should the employees go on hunger-strike?
 I have received a telegram from there saying that if I intervene, some agreement can be arrived at. I have said I do not hold any power. Of course they are all my friends. They have worked with me and they say that they will abide by my decision. But I cannot say anything. Ashok Mehta is there. He also wants to leave things in my hands. I must express my inability. So long we did not have power in our hands. Now that we have the power why should I destroy that power by my interference? I do not wish that people should make me  a dictator. Only God can take work from me. The Government has done its work. It has agreed to implement the recommendations of the Pay Commission. Why should I spoil the thing by my intervention ? Therefore, they should not expect me to do anything about it. The employees should also not indulge in token strikes and the like. I say this in all humility. I am their friend as well as the friend of the Government and of the Rajas. They should not persuade me to do anything which is wrong. It is the duty of all the parties to get all work done by the Government that will assume office on August 15. In the days of British rule we were hampered. We tried to assert ourselves. We started a non-violent battle. We can still do so. But we have got to be equipped for it. Public opinion has to be prepared.
 
 Take, for instance, the question of banning cow-slaughter. Shall we bring coercion to bear on the Muslims ? Then why not on the Hindus? Why not on the Parsis? Cow-protection cannot be ensured in this manner. If we follow our respective faiths the cow can be saved without resort to legislation. I want that even Muslims should not slaughter cows. They should not eat beef. But this has to be left to them. We should not assume in our pride that since power has now come into our hands, we can force others to our will through law. I want that we should make proper use of the swaraj which we have won. Let us follow the path of dharma, so that the real swaraj we want may be ours soon.

  EVEN PROUD GUJARAT!libtech_245_footnote 
 Shri Maganbhai Desai has sent me a copy of his correspondence with Shri Ratanlal Parikh. The latter writes :
 The report in the newspapers of the Congress decision in regard to Hindi has made a great impression on the public mind. People are so much opposed to the Urdu script that it is as well that the move in support of it is no longer a live issue. Even staunch Congressmen have begun to oppose it. This means that the number of candidates for Hindustani examinations to be held in February is likely to be greatly reduced.
I hope that what Shri Ratanlal says is not true. Gujarat must not
 commit this folly. I do not approve of the dislike of the writers for Urdu, though of course I can understand it. But for the life of me I cannot understand this thoughtless dislike of the script. Does it not betray a bankruptcy of practical sense? The Gujaratis as businessmen do not discriminate between friend and foe. They gladly take money from both. Will they not show the same business sense in politics?
 In Delhi  I  daily  come  in  contact  with  Hindus  and  Mus- lims. Most of the Hindus speak a language which  has  very  few Sanskrit words and many more Persian words. They or the vast majority  do  not  know  the   Devanagari   script.   They  write  to   me in Urdu or in indifferent English and when I take them to task for writing in English, they write in Urdu. If the national language is to be
 
 
 Hindi and the script only Devanagari, what will be the plight of these Hindus?
 But I confess that in this matter I have a bias for  Muslim brethren, though not of Gujarat. The Muslims of Gujarat do not know Urdu. They can learn it with difficulty. Their mother tongue is Gujarati. But the language of the Muslims in North India  is Hindustani, that is to say, simple Urdu. The millions of villagers of India have nothing to do with books. They speak Hindustani, which the Muslims write in the Urdu script, while of the Hindus some write in Urdu and some in the Nagari script. Therefore, the duty of people like you and me is to write in both the scripts. The Gujaratis decided to perform this duty with gladness. They found joy in doing this. It was not a bitter draught. Why then have they developed a dislike for the Urdu script now? For me it has become all the sweeter in the present atmosphere of bitterness. The non-Pakistani muslims are all the dearer to me. They must not look up to Pakistan for their safety. Such a thing would be a shame for Hinduism. Sanatana Hindu Dharma is not narrow. It is liberal. It is not circumscribed like the frog in the well. It is the dharma of mankind. A Malayali commentator of the Mahabharata has, in my opinion rightly, called it the history of mankind. Be it as it may, the word Hindu is not derived from Sanskrit. The foreigners called the inhabitants on this side of the river Sindhu Hindus. We have adopted the title. Manu is not the name of any one man. The Law of Manu is known as Manava Dharma Shastra (the Law of Mankind). This Law has human origin. One can only guess as to how many of the shlokas are the original work of Manu and how many are interpolations. Dr. Bhagwandas has pointed out a number of interpolations. The Arya Samaj looks upon certain others as such. There has been some difference of opinion even on the interpretation. In my opinion whatever out of them appeals to the head and heart of the wise, is the law for mankind. There is, therefore, always room for addition or deletion. The shlokas looked upon as interpolations are the result of the efforts, successful or unsuccessful, of the reformers in different ages. Such a law belongs to all mankind. It does not permit of discrimination on grounds of caste and class. It knows no distinctions between Hindus, Muslims and Christians—all are equally men. How can one believing  in  this  Shastra  make distinction between one person and another. “This is mine and that is someone else’s, is the calculation of narrow minds’ is one of the pearls of wisdom. Going by this immortal shloka you and I cannot discriminate
 between Hindustan and Pakistan. What even if you and I happen to be the only ones having such a belief. If we are true, others are bound to follow us.
 The Congress has always had this broad vision. Today it is needed more than ever before. India has accepted partition at the point of the bayonet. This cannot be undone in the same way. The two can become one only when there is heart unity.
 The omens today seem to point to the contrary. In this crisis the Congress must stand firm like a rock. The national language can only be one, not two. It cannot be Persianized Urdu or Sanskritized Hindi. It must be a beautiful blend of the two simple forms written in either script. How I wish Gujarat would remain unaffected by the gathering storm. Will those who have soared high now crash at the first blow? If I have my way, this will not happen. There is a Gujarati hymn which says, “Will he who has been purified by the fire of love ever turn back?” Let us follow the poet. Let us not turn away from the Urdu script. We must not turn back.

 CHI. CHIMANLAL,
 Yesterday I despatched the letters to you. I am sending three Europeans to you. Please look after them. Give them lots of work. Since they are poor they will need to be cared for. Do not show them undue importance. Treat them as you would our own people. They do not even take milk. If you find them a burden, you can send them on their way. They are good men. They are hard-working. Prabhakar and Wardekar have already come to know them.
 Please take good care of the cows. Take Balvantsinha, Parnerkar and Aryanayakum into your confidence in all maters. Do what Jajuji says. In my view Sevagram cannot do without milk. Maybe we should dispense with the condition that everyone should get milk only from the village. Do what you think is right.

 Replying to a question by the President of the Punjab Student Christian League, Gandhiji said:
Foreign missionaries will not be asked to quit India. Indian
 Christians will be free to occupy high official positions in the Indian Dominion.
 Asked if non-Christians in the Indian Dominion would have freedom to embrace Christianity, Mahatma Gandhi said he would be guided in this connection by the rules and laws framed.
Christ came into this world to preach and spread the gospel of
 love and peace, but what his followers have brought about is tyranny
 
 
 and misery. Christians who were taught the maxim of ‘Love thy neighbour as thyself,’libtech_252_footnoteare divided among themselves.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING      RAWALPINDI,libtech_253_footnote 
  July 	31, 1947  Speaking 	after the Ramdhun 	he said 	that he had 	received two 	letters which he 	would like to answer. The 	first was in English. The handwriting was good but that was 	little consolation for 	him. The 	British were quitting 	India but the people 	had become 	so used 	to slavery 	that they still 	could not shake 	off the lure of 	the English 	language which 	few could 	ever hope to master. 	This linguistic 	conquest constituted a 	worse type 	of slavery 	than the conquest 	by the 	British sword. Every 	language was good in 	its own place. 	He would 	not ask the Zulus 	or the 	Dutch in 	South Africa to 	learn Gujarati, 	for instance, 	Similarly, he would 	not ask all the sisters 	assembled there to learn 	English. That 	was neither 	possible nor desirable. 	His mother 	tongue was Gujarati. 	He loved 	it. But he 	would not 	think of 	making it 	the lingua 	franca of India. 	There were hardly a 	crore of 	Indians who 	spoke Gujarati 	but there 	were nearly 21 crores 	who talked 	in Hindustani; 	whether they could read 	or write 	was a 	different matter. 	Hindustani was written in the Urdu or Nagari script.  The 	second letter was 	 written  in 	 beautiful  Urdu  	handwriting.  He 	 en- couraged all 	those who 	came in contact 	with him to 	learn the 	two scripts and 	he was 	proud of 	the fact. He 	would rather 	teach Urdu to 	his boys and girls than 	teach them English.  In 	the letter 	written in  English, 	the writer 	had asked 	him to 	 spend at 	 least a 	week in 	Rawalpindi and 	see with his own eyes 	what the  Hindus  had  suffered. Why 	should he 	wish to 	go to Kashmir ? 	His  reply was  that ever  since he  had 	gone to 	Delhi he 	had wanted 	to come 	to the 	Punjab. He 	wanted to 	visit Lahore, 	Amritsar and 	Rawalpindi. But 	he believed 	that he 	was in 	God’s hands. God 	was the Master 	of all the universe 	and He could 	upset the plans 	of men. 	The original 	plan was that 	he would spend a day at Lahore and Amritsar, two days at Rawalpindi 	and at least ten days in Kashmir. Now he had only two or three days 	for Kashmir. And that too was 	in fulfilment 	of a promise.       
 Though he could not stay in the Punjab, he had not forgotten them. He had to reach Noakhali before the 15th. That again was in fulfilment of a promise. He was a devotee of Rama and Rama had said that a promise must be kept at any cost. He referred to the black flag demonstration that Hindu young men had arranged at the Amritsar railway station. All the time the train stopped they kept shouting ‘Gandhi, Go Back’ in English. He had to close his ears as he could not stand the noise. He closed his eyes also and kept on repeating God’s name. They were too noisy and too excited, else he would have liked to get down and ask them what harm he had done to them to deserve such noisy hostility. He knew however that praise and blame must be received with equanimity. At the other stations people were extremely well-behaved and cordial. He had not been disturbed during the night and he was grateful for it.
 In the second letter the writer had objected to the projected recitation from the Koran. If the people had been quiet, they would have heard the verse from the Koran. It was a fine verse and he saw no reason why he should avoid it simply because it was from the Koran and written in Arabic. No one could object to the  sentiments  expressed therein. If they wished to live in peace as brave men and women, they must cultivate the virtue of tolerance. The only right way of fighting the misled Muslims was the way of love. But if they did not appreciate it, they had the crude way of retaliation open to them; but to Insult the scriptures of either religion because of the misdeeds of its followers was a thing which he could never understand.

  BURIED ALIVE? 
 A correspondent from Hyderabad (Deccan) writes: “Gandhi is being buried alive.”
 Gandhi means Gandhi’s ideals. It is through these ideals that we have reached where we are. But we are kicking away the very ladder over which we have climbed so high. And it is those who are considered Gandhi’s greatest followers who are doing this. Hindu-Muslim unity, Hindustani, khadi and village industries have been completely forgotten. Those who still talk about them are either themselves deceived or are deceiving others.
This is by far the best way of burying me alive. But can I believe
 that I have already been buried ? Who is my greatest follower and who is the smallest ? I have only one follower, that is myself, or all Indians. My followers are those who have faith in the above-  mentioned activities. I do hope that crores of villagers do believe in these few things. Even then the allegation is quite true. However, I find that even the members of the Muslim League have started saying that we are all brothers. It has even been accepted that we are citizens of both the States. For the time being there is no need for passports. That will become necessary if either of the two countries introduces them. Let us hope that passports will never be needed and let us so behave that they will not be needed.
 Let us hope that neither of the communities will give up khadi and cause harm to the village industries. I have already written about Hindustani. How can we give it up? How can the Muslims whose mother tongue is Urdu give it up? They have to make their Urdu simple. Similarly the Hindus will have to make Hindi simple. Only then can the two communities understand each other. The correspon- dent has forgotten the most important thing. The Hindus have to purify themselves by eschewing untouchability and caste differences. Similarly, Muslims have to purify themselves by giving up their hatred of Hindus.

  THE TRI-COLOUR 
 The correspondent from Hyderabad who wrote “Gandhi is being buried alive”libtech_256_footnotewrites further on :
 The tri-colour was the symbol of our struggle. A grave sin has been committed by taking away the wheel from it. The new wheel or the old Asoka Chakra has no connection with Gandhi’s wheel; indeed it is incompatible with it. Gandhi’s wheel was above religion while the new wheel is a symbol of Hinduism. Gandhi’s wheel is a sign of ‘non-violent economy’ while the new one represents the Sudarshan Chakralibtech_257_footnote(as Shri Munshilibtech_258_footnotesays in his broadcast) which represents violence. In this way the new flag will encourage the violent tendencies in the nation. A deliberate attempt is being made in that direction. This is not the way to bring Pakistan back into the fold but to perpetuate the division.
 I have not read what Shri Munshi said. The national flag is doomed if it signifies what the correspondent says. Under no circumstances can the Asoka Chakra become a symbol of violence. Emperor Asoka was a Buddhist and a votary of non-violence. The Sudarshan Chakra can have no connection with the wheel in the flag. According to me the Sudarshan Chakra is a symbol of non-violence. But that is my personal view. Generally the Sudarshan Chakra is believed to be an instrument of violence. We can say from the debates which took place on the new flag that if it has not rendered the spinning-wheel valueless it has without doubt diminished its value. Whether the Asoka Chakra and the spinning-wheel are the same thing will ultimately depend on the behaviour of the people.

     THE REASON FOR ADDITIONlibtech_259_footnote   	During the three days I passed in Srinagar, though I had prayers in 	the compound of Lala Kishorilal’s bungalow, where I was 	accommodated, I made no speeches. I had so declared before leaving 	Delhi. But some of the audience sent me questions. One was :  I 	attended your prayer meeting last evening in which you recited two 	prayers of the other communities. May I know what is your idea in 	doing so and what you mean by religion ? As 	I have observed before now, the selection from the Koran  	was introduced some years ago on the suggestion of Raihana Tyabjilibtech_260_footnotewho was then living in the Sevagram Ashram and the one 	from the Parsi prayers at the instance of Dr. Gilder who recited the 	Parsi prayer       
 on  the  break  of  my  fastlibtech_261_footnotelibtech_262_footnotein   the   Aga     Khan   Palace   during   our detention. I am of opinion that the addition enriched the prayer. It reached the hearts of a larger audience than before. It certainly showed Hinduism in its broad and tolerant aspect. The questioner ought also to have asked why the prayer commenced with  the Buddhist prayer in Japanese. The selection of the stanzas of the prayer has a history behind it befitting the sacred character. The Buddhist prayer was the prayer which the whole of Sevagram resounded in the early morning when a good Japanese  monklibtech_263_footnotelibtech_264_footnotewas staying at the Sevagram Ashram and who by his silent and dignified conduct had endeared himself to the inmates of the Ashram.

  SPEECH AT GURUDWARA, PUNJA SAHEBlibtech_265_footnote 
 [August 5, 1947]libtech_266_footnoteReplying to the address Gandhiji [said he] did not consider it possible that Eastern Punjab should be handed over entirely to the Sikhs to govern. He felt that
 Sikhs should never entertain such an unworthy ambition. The Sikhs were reputed, and rightly, to be a warlike race. With them of all the persons in the world, merit and merit alone should be the sole test for holding any office. He hoped that throughout the two dominions merit would be the sole test.  The speaker invited the Sikhs to lead in this desirable competition.
 Coming to the protection of Punja Saheb, Nankana Saheb and the other Gurudwaras that may be found in Pakistan or elsewhere, he said:
One Sikh is equal to one and a quarter lakh men.  Why should
 he beg for anyone’s help? If they have the mettle no one can cast an evil eye on Punja Saheb. But these days the Sikh brethren have taken to luxury and enjoyment. I do not intend to say that Sikhs alone have fallen into that habit. Among others women also have taken to fashionable ways though to a lesser degree.  But do not think that I
 
 
 am defending them. Some take liquor in large quantities while others take less but that does not mean that it is a virtue to drink less. Similarly it is not a virtue to be less fashionable. As long as true Sikhs are alive no one can cause you any harm.
 Do not look to any other power outside yourselves for the protection of these shrines. I would like every Sikh to be a defender of his faith and, therefore, of all the Gurudwaras and not merely of Punja Saheb which is one of the greatest. At the same time I want you to shed all fear about the future. I would ask you to rely upon the plighted word of the Muslim leaders. They have got their Pakistan. They have no quarrel now with anyone in India—at least they should have none. If your fears materialize and any attempt at desecration of the Gurudwaras is made by the Muslims, it will be contrary to the tradition of Islam as I know it. And those Muslims who take part in such desecration would be partakers in  the  destruction  of  Islam. Every faith is on its trial in India. God is the infallible Judge and the world which is His creation will judge the Muslim leaders not  according to their pledge and promises but according to the deeds of these leaders and their followers. What I have said of the Muslim leaders is also true of the leaders and followers of other faith.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_267_footnote     WAH, 
  August 	5, 1947  Gandhiji 	said that he was glad that he was able to visit the Refugee Camp at 	Wah and see the patients in the Camp hospital and other appointments 	in connection with it. He was glad too that he was able to pay what 	was his second visit to Punja Saheb. He had a talk with the 	representatives of the Camp.  Before, 	however, he dealt with matters arising out of these talks with the 	representatives of the refugees, he said that he would like to say a 	word about his visit to Kashmir. He had made up his mind not to hold 	any public meeting or address them but he was able see the workers. 	Begum Saheba (wife of Sheikh Abdullalibtech_268_footnote) was constantly 	with him throughout the three days he was in Srinagar. He was able 	also       
 to see the Maharaja Saheblibtech_269_footnote, the Maharani Saheb and Prime Minister Kak Saheblibtech_270_footnote. He was sorry that he was not able to see Sheikh Abdullah who was undoubtedly the leader  of the Kashmiris. He had not gone there see the Sheikh Saheb. He was able, however, to hold public prayers for two days in Kashmir and one day in Jammu. These were attended by thousands. He could say that on August 15, all being well, legally the State of Kashmir and Jammu would be independent. But he was sure that the State would not remain in that condition for long after August 15. It had to join either the union or Pakistan. It had a predominantly Muslim population. But he saw that Sheikh Saheb had fired Kashmiris with local patriotism. British Paramountcy would terminate on the 15th instant. Real paramountcy would then commence. He referred to the paramountcy of the Kashmiris. They had one language, one culture and, so far as he could see, they were one people. He could not distinguish readily between a Kashmiri Hindu and a Kashmiri Mussalman. In the large deputation that he saw it was very difficult for him to know whether it was predominantly Muslim or Hindu. Whatever it was, he had no hesitation in saying that the will of the Kashmiris was the supreme law in Kashmir and Jammu. He was glad to say that the Maharaja Saheb and the Maharani Saheba readily acknowledged the fact. He had the good fortune to read what was euphemistically called the Treaty of Amritsarlibtech_271_footnotebut which was  in reality a deed of sale. He supposed that it would be dead on August 15. The seller was the then British Governor-Generallibtech_272_footnoteand Maharaja Gulab Singh was the buyer. The treaty going, would the State revert to the British and therefore, to England? If to India, to which part ? He held that without going into the intricacies of law which he had no right to dilate upon, common sense dictated that the will of the Kashmiris should decide the fate of Kashmir and Jammu. The sooner it was done the better. How the will of the people would be determined was a fair question. He hoped that the question would be decided between the two Dominions, the Maharaja Saheb and the Kashmiris. If the four could come to a joint decision, much trouble would be avoided. After all Kashmir was a big State; it had the greatest strategic value, perhaps in all India. So much for Kashmir.
 He would now deal with the question of the refugees. Among them they were nearly 9,000. The Hindus and the Sikhs who discussed the question with him said that they were afraid of the approach of August 15. He confessed that he did not in any way whatsoever share the fear. Nor could he appreciate it. The Muslims had got their Pakistan. They could now have no quarrel with the Hindus and the Sikhs of the Punjab. Jinnah Saheb and other Muslim Leaguers had given assurances that the non- Muslims were as safe in Pakistan as the Muslims. He invited the audience to accept the assurance. Supposing that the assurance proved untrue and the worst fears
 
 
        created       
 of the refugees proved true, it would be the beginning of the ruin of Islam.  He refused   to believe that Muslim leaders would be guilty of such a suicidal act. He asked the refugees, men and women, to dispel all fear. If he could put off his departure for Noakhali, he would gladly pass August 15 in the midst of the refugees at Wah. He proposed, however, to do the next best thing. The audience saw Dr. Sushila Nayyar taking notes of what he was saying. She herself belonged to the district of Gujrat in Western Pakistan. He had conferred with her before coming to the prayer meeting and though she was otherwise to accompany him to Noakhali, she had accepted his advice to stay with the refugees on his behalf, in order to help them to dispel all fear about August 15. He knew that she had no such fear. She was with him in Noakhali as was also her brother Pyarelal. She was posted in one of the worst-affected areas of Noakhali and through medical assistance she had become popular among the Muslims as she was undoubtedly among the Hindus. He had just heard from the District Commissioner who was a Muslim, that the refugees in and about Rawalpindi had nothing to fear. They should feel as safe as the Muslim inhabitants.

  NOTE ON KASHMIR VISITlibtech_273_footnote 
 [August 6, 1947]libtech_274_footnoteNo public prayer was held on the day of arrival but I appeared before them twice or thrice and said that I could not make any public
speech,   not  because  there  was  any  prohibition  but  because  I  had

 that with the lapse of British Para-mountcy the true Paramountcy of the people of Kashmir would com-mence.

 Bakshi (Ghulam Mohammadlibtech_276_footnotelibtech_277_footnote) was most sanguine that the result of the free vote of the people, whether on the adult franchise or on the existing register, would be in favour of Kashmir joining the Union provided of course that Sheikh Abdullah and his co-prisoners were released, all bans were removed and the present Prime Minister was not in power. Probably he echoed the general sentiment. I studied the Amritsar treaty properly called “sale deed”. I presume it lapses on the 15th instant. To whom does the State revert? Does it not go to the people ?

   TALK WITH CONGRESS WORKERS       LAHORE, 
    Mahatma 	Gandhi said :  August 	6, 1947 
  	The rest of my life is going to be spent in Pakistan, maybe in East 	Bengal or West Punjab, or perhaps, the North-West Frontier Province.  In 	answer to a question by Dr. Lehna Singh, General Secretary of the 	Punjab Provincial Congress Committee, Gandhiji said that if the 	Pakistan flag was such as would ensure equal rights and full 	protection to the minorities, they should all accept and honour the 	flag, and have absolutely no hesitation in saluting it. He added : I 	would ask you not to disown the Pakistan flag merely on the  	ground that it bears the crescent. I must, however, say that in case 	no assurance of the kind I have mentioned is forthcoming, at least I 	will refuse to salute the flag.  Replying 	to a similar question in connection with the flag of the Indian 	Union, he said: I 	must say that if the flag of the Indian Union will not contain  	the emblem of the charkha I will refuse to salute that flag. You 	know the National Flag of India was first thought of by me and I 	cannot conceive of India’s National Flag without the emblem of the 	charkha. We have, however, been told by Pandit Nehru and others that 	the sign of wheel or the chakra in the new National Flag symbolizes 	the  charkha also. Some describe the wheel-mark as Sudarshan Chakra, 	but I know what Sudarshan Chakra means.  Referring 	to the Punjab, Gandhiji said :  	My heart has always been with the Punjab and the sad tales of woes 	and sufferings of the Punjab which I have been hearing, have made me 	always think of the Punjab. Do not think that I have forgotten your 	province. I am fully aware of the sufferings of the Punjab. I have 	been yearning to come to the Punjab ever since I came to Delhi, but 	there were certain forces which were against my coming to this 	province. My 10 present place is in Noakhali and I would go there 	even if I have to die. But as soon as I am free from Noakhali I will 	come to the Punjab. I hope to be free from Noakhali very soon. I 	am grieved to learn that people are running away from the 
 West Punjab and I am told that Lahore is being evacuated by the non- Muslims. I must say that this is what it should not be. If you think Lahore is dead or is dying, do not run away from it, but die with what you think is the dying Lahore.
 When you suffer from fear you die before death comes to you. That is not glorious. I will not feel sorry if I hear that people in the Punjab have died not as cowards but as brave men. I am not prepared to submit to any kind of compulsion or any interference with religion.  I would refuse to stop saying ‘Rama’ if I am forced to do so and would prefer to be murdered. Similarly I cannot be forced to salute any flag. But if in that act I am murdered I would bear no ill will against anyone and would rather pray for better sense for the person or persons who murder me.
 My conception of a Sikh has always been of a brave person, who does not fear death, but who will not do any harm  to  any innocent person.
 Gandhiji said that if the present quarrel between Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs continued it would serve as an invitation to any foreign power to come and invade India. He, therefore, made an earnest appeal to put a stop to the present quarrel which did not credit either community.

 GANDHIJI: What will happen to this one?
 GUARD: The passengers from the other compartment will occupy it.
 If it is good enough for them, it should be good enough for me, too. How can I think of making myself comfortable at  others’ expense!

 Do not harass poor passengers and do not take bribes. That will be the greatest service you can render to me.

  I 	am a subject of 	the Union 	of India 	to which 	I pledge 	my loyalty 	in all 	circumstances.  I 	repudiate the 	theory that Hindus and 	the Muslims are 	two separate Nations 	and hold 	the view 	that all the people 	of India, 	to whatever 	race or 	religion they may 	belong, are 	parts of 	one Nation.  I 	shall to 	conduct myself in 	all my 	actions and 	speech as 	to strengthen this 	idea of One 	Nationality of 	all the inhabitants 	of this 	ancient and 	sacred land.  If 	at any time I 	am found 	guilty of a 	breach of 	this declaration, 	I shall 	render myself liable to 	removal from any 	office or 	post of 	profit that I 	may be 	holding at the time. 
The wording may admit of improvement. But the spirit behind
 is surely admirable and worthy of adoption if we are to get out of unhealthy growth in the body politic.

   NOTES  
 WHY  NOT INDIAN?
 His second question was why Lord Mountbatten was selected as the first Governor-General. The reason so far as I know is properly guessed by the questioner. There was no equallysuitable Indian for the post. He, being the part, if not the sole, author of the conception lying behind the Indian Independence Bill, seemed to the members of the Interim Government to be the fittest person to pilot the ship of State safe through the troubled waters. The appointment if it was a
 credit to the British, was equally a credit to the Indian statesmen who had shown themselves free from prejudice and who were capable of rising above prejudice. They showed that they were brave enough to trust their erstwhile opponents.
 THE MINORITIES
 He next asks why I do not agree that the minorities should quit their respective dominions.
 No one has asked me to agree. But I should oppose any such movement There is no occasion to distrust the majority in either Dominion. And in any case, now that there are two sovereign States in India, each has to ensure the proper treatment of the minorities in the other. Let us hope that such a contingency will never arise. I hold too that every right carries with it a duty, better still, there is no right which does not flow from duty duly performed.
 LEAVING POLITICS AFTER THE 15TH?
 Fourthly, he asks whether I would leave politics after the 15th when India will be free.
 In the first instance there is no freedom approaching the Kingdom of God. We seem to be as far from it as ever. And in any case the life of the millions is my politics from which I dare not free myself without denying my life work and God. That my politics may take a different turn is quite possible. But that will be determined by circumstances.
Lastly he says :
 You have done a lot of work in Bihar; why was the Punjab ignored?
 All I can say is that my not going to the Punjab must not be counted as my neglect of the province. Nevertheless the question is quite apposite and has been asked more than once. The  neatest  answer I gave was that I had no call from within and my counsellors gave me no encouragement.

   STUDENTS’ DIFFICULTIES  
 There is an attempt today to bring together all the existing students’ organizations in a national convention, to revise the basis of the student movement and to evolve a united national organization of students. What, in your opinion, should be the scope of this new organization? What activities should this students’ organization undertake in the new circumstances in the country?
There is no doubt that there should be one national organization
 including the Hindus, the Muslims and the others. Students are the makers of the future. They cannot be partitioned. I am sorry  to observe that neither the students have thought for themselves nor have the leaders left them to their studies so that they can become good citizens. The rot began with the alien government. We, the inheritors, have not taken the trouble to rectify the errors of the past. Then the different political groups have sought to catch the students as if they were shoals of fish. And stupidly the students have run into the net spread for them.
 It is therefore a herculean task for any students’ organization to undertake. But there must be a heroic spirit among them who would not shrink from the task. The scope will be to knit them together into one. This they cannot do unless they will learn to steer clear of active politics. A student’s duty is to study the various problems that require solution. His time for action comes after he finishes his studies.
 Today students’ organizations are more concerned with passing resolutions on political affairs than devoting their energies to the task of national reconstruction. This is partly due to the attempts which political party have been making to capture the students’ organizations for their party purposes. Our present disunity too can be traced to these party politics. We, therefore, want to evolve some method by which we can prevent the repetition of all this party politics and disunity in the proposed national union of students. Do you think it is possible for the students’ organizations to eschew politics completely? If not, what, in your opinion, is the extent to which students’ organizations should interest themselves in politics?
This   question  is  partly answered  above.	They  must  eschew
 active politics. It is  a  sign  of  one-sided  growth  that  all  parties  14 have made use of the student world for their purpose. This was probably inevitable when the purpose of education was to create  a
 race of slaves who would hug their slavery. That part of the business is over, I hope. The students’ first business is to think  out  the education that the children of a free nation should receive. The education of today is obviously not such. I must not go into the question as to what it should be. Only they must not allow themselves to be deceived into the belief that it is the function only of the elders in the university senates. They must stimulate the faculty of thinking.  I do not even remotely suggest that the students can force the situation by strikes and the like. They have to  create  public  opinion  by offering constructive and enlightened criticism. The senators having been brought up in the old school are slow to move. They can truly be acted upon by enlightenment.
 Today, the majority of students are not interesting themselves in national service. Many of them are cultivating what they consider ‘fashionable’ western habits, and more and more students are resorting to bad habits like drinking, etc. There is little efficiency and little desire for independent thinking. We want to tackle all these problems, and build up character, discipline and efficiency in youth. How do you think we can do it ?
This deals with the present distemper. It will disappear when a
 calm atmosphere is produced, when the students cease to be agitators and take to sober studies. A student’s life has been rightly likened to the life of a sannyasi. He must be the embodiment of simple living and high thinking. He must be discipline incarnate. His pleasure is derived from his studies. They do provide real pleasure when study ceases to be a tax the student has to pay. What can be a greater pleasure than that a student marches from knowledge to more knowledge?

   IS HE BURIED ALIVE ?  
 There is substance in the biting criticism.libtech_288_footnoteBut  I  cling  to  the hope that I am not yet buried alive. The hope rests on the belief that the masses have not lost faith in them. When it is proved that they have, they will be lost and I can then be said to have been buried alive. But so long as my faith burns bright, as I hope it will even if I stand
 
 alone, I shall be alive in the grave and what is more, speaking from it. The correspondent forgets untouchability and prohibition.  The former is rapidly disappearing. And it looks as if prohibition is coming. I am quite sure that if the Congress forsakes the ideals it adopted in 1920, it will commit suicide.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_293_footnote       PATNA, 
  August 	8, 1947  Gandhiji 	began his speech 	by saying 	that he was 	sorry that he 	could not 	come to 	Bihar earlier. But even in Delhi and other places he worked for 	Bihar and Noakhali. His ‘do-or-die’ 	determination was guiding 	him in all spheres, 	and for the fulfilment 	of that determination he 	was going 	to Noakhali.  He 	must reach Noakhali two or three days before August 15 as the people 	there were extremely nervous, although he knew that nothing was 	going to happen. Unnecessary panic did not help anybody and if 	people were brave and god-fearing it did not matter if they lost 	their lives. He was going to Noakhali to allay panic.  He 	did not know what God had ordained and he also could not say what 	the Government would do. To him the whole of India was his country 	and he could not reconcile himself to the idea of partition in 	water-tight compartments. He wanted to live both in Hindustan and 	Pakistan and both were his homelands. Similar was the    
 case with Jinnah Saheb. Muslims had got Pakistan. Now it was incumbent on the people of both Hindustan and Pakistan to live like good human beings and bring peace to the country.
 Gandhiji warned the Hindus of Bihar never to think of repeating their crime of last year and said that they should help in rehabilitating all the refugees who were returning from Bengal. Love was the highest virtue and they should cultivate it for all. He hoped that he would be able to proclaim from Noakhali that Hindus and Muslims were forgetting their past and were living in brotherly feeling for each other.
 The 15th is the day of our trial. Observe a fast on that day.  Everyone should  do his duty. No one should create any disturbance. The independence we are going to  get is not of the kind we can celebrate by having illuminations. We do not have foodgrains, clothes, ghee or oil. So where is the need for celebrations? On that day we have to fast, ply the charkha and pray to God. We did not have illumination on April 6, did we?  Didn’t we celebrate the declaration of that day by fasting from April  6 to April 13? Moreover that day was better than today’s independence. Brothers did not quarrel between themselves as they do now. Everyone could freely go to temples or mosques.libtech_294_footnote
 Mahatma Gandhi expressed his desire to return to Bihar after three weeks’ stay in Noakhali and said that on his return he would stay in Bihar for about a fortnight.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        SODEPUR, 
  August 	9, 1947  Gandhiji 	devoted the 	whole of 	his address 	to the 	situation in 	Calcutta. His 	destination, he 	said, was Noakhali 	but he 	had been listening 	the whole day long to 	the woes of 	Calcutta. Some 	Muslim friends and 	also some Hindus 	complained that they 	(Hindus) seemed to have gone mad, not that the Muslims had become 	wiser. But now 	that the 	Muslim police and 	officials were 	almost withdrawn and 	replaced by 	Hindus, the Hindus had 	begun to believe that they were now free to do what they liked  as 	the Muslims 	were reported 	to have 	done under the League 	Ministry. He was 	not going 	to examine 	what was done 	under the League 	Ministry. His 	purpose was 	undoubtedly to 	know what his co-worker 	Dr. Ghosh’slibtech_296_footnoteMinistry was 	doing. Was 	it true 	that the Muslims were 	living in 	terror? If 	it was at 	all true, 	it was 	a severe 	reflection on 	the Congress 	Ministry. He 	was rightly 	asked before he went 	up to 	Noakhali to 	tarry in 	Calcutta to 	‘pour a 	pot of 	water over the 	raging fire’ that was 	burning Calcutta. He 	would love to 	give his 	life if 	thereby he 	could contribute to 	the quenching 	of mob 	fury. He would 	never be able 	to subscribe 	to the 	theory that 	the doings in 	Calcutta were 	the result 	of goondaism. 	He held that 	the crude 	open goondaism 	was a 	reflection of 	the subtle 	goondaism they 	were harbouring within. 	Hence it 	was the duty 	of the 	Governments to 	hold themselves 	responsible for the acts 	of the 	goondas so 	called. He 	hoped that Calcutta 	would not present 	the disgraceful 	spectacle of hot goondaism when they were entering upon full responsibility.  Harijan, 	24-8-1947

   INTERVIEW TO CONGRESS MINISTERS  
 August 10, 1947
 The Congress Ministers of the Government of Bengal interviewed Gandhiji at
 3.30 p. m. One of the questions which they wanted to discuss was the manner in which the 15th should be celebrated. Gandhiji said, according to him, the advice could only be for fasting, prayer and a dedication to the spinning-wheel. What else could they do when all around the country was burning, when people were dying from lack of food and clothing?
 The question of the relation between Pakistan and India was also raised by one of the Ministers. Gandhiji said :
Each State should perform its duty properly. If the conduct is
 straight, there is likelihood of reunion. But what he witnessed today was a preparation for hostility not for friendship.
 My Days with Gandhi, p. 256
 
   DISCUSSION WITH MOHAMMED USMAN AND OTHERS  
 August 10, 1947
 Mohammad Usmanlibtech_297_footnoteagain came. A large Muslim deputation accompanied him. They entreated Gandhiji to stay on in Calcutta even if it were only for two more days :
 We Muslims have as much claim upon you as the Hindus. For you yourself have said you are as much of Muslims as of Hindus.
 GANDHIJI: I am willing, but then you have to guarantee  the peace of Noakhali. If I do not go to Noakhali before the 15th on the strength of your guarantee and things go wrong there, my life will
 
 
 become forfeit; you will have to face a fast unto death on my part.libtech_298_footnote
 Gandhiji told them that though he was anxious to reach Noakhali as soon as possible, in deference to their wishes he could postpone going from the 11th August to the 13th.
 Mahatma Gandhi—The Last Phase, Vol. II, p. 363
 
    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       SODEPUR, 
  August 	10, 1947  Gandhiji 	said that he 	had thought 	that he 	was to 	go to Noakhali the 	next day (Monday). 	Owing to the 	pressure from 	many Muslim friends who 	had seen him, he had 	decided to 	stay to 	see if he could 	contribute his share 	in the return 	of sanity 	in the 	premier city of 	India.libtech_299_footnoteThe argument 	of the Muslim 	friends went home. He had 	at the same time said 	that if he did 	not go to Noakhali 	and any mishap 	took place, 	his life 	would become forfeit as 	he had said 	already about Bihar. He 	had seen 	the Ministers 	and others 	too during 	the day. 	He would 	like to see 	the places where 	destruction was said 	to have 	been wrought by the 	Hindus. He 	had also 	learnt that there were parts of 	Calcutta which were 	inaccessible to the Hindus, though many premises therein used to  be 	occupied by 	them. Similar 	was the case with the 	Hindu localities. He 	hung his 	head in 	shame to 	listen to 	this recital 	of man’s 	barbarism. He 	would love to 	go to these 	places and see for 	himself how 	much truth there was 	in these 	recitals. He was 	told that there were not 	more than 23% 	Muslims in 	Calcutta. It 	was unthinkable 	that such 	a minority 	could coerce the majority 	without countenance from or 	incompetence of 	authority. Similarly it 	was unthinkable 	that in 	the midst of 	a government 	which knew the art of 	government, the 	majority could for 	one moment be 	permitted to 	coerce the 	minority. He 	was also 	told that as the 	Muslim police and 	officers were 	alleged to 	be doing before, now 	that the Congress 	Ministry was in 	power, the 	Hindu police 	and officers 	had become 	partial in the 	administration of 	justice. If 	this wretched 	spirit of communalism 	had entered 	the police 	force, the prospect 	was bleak 	indeed. He hoped that the police would realize the dignity of their profession.

I do not know whether I have been clear enough to give you any comfort.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       SODEPUR, 
  August 	11, 1947  	This evening I must devote to answering some questions addressed to 	me. One of them complains that prominent men were admitted but 	comparatively unknown persons were insulted. There was an inordinate 	rush throughout the day, it being Sunday. I agree that when there is 	such a rush, there should be no distinction made between known and 	unknown persons. But I had given previous appointments to some who 	had to be admitted.  Then there were many    
 who were specially working for the day. I would, therefore, plead with those who may feel disappointed on such occasions to have forbearance and patience as I would plead with the volunteers to be uniformly courteous and gentle with the public.
 I read something about the Chittagong flood the day before yesterday, when I came to Calcutta. This is the third day and I see that the angry waters have not subsided, and the extent of loss of life and property no one can yet assess with any degree of accuracy. It is hardly necessary to remind ourselves in the face of such catastrophe that we may not think of East or West or Pakistan and Hindustan. Adversity makes strange bed-fellows. Surely then those who were bed-fellows till yesterday must not cease to be at least on such occasions, whatever their political or religious differences might be or might have been. It is a calamity to cope with not merely for East Bengal but for the whole of Bengal, and not for Bengal only but certainly for the whole of India. There must be a strong reliable committee to collect and distribute funds. Local men come first. Round them can arise an all-Bengal relief committee, and if need be an all-India one. No trouble need be given to all India if Bengal alone can cope with the situation. My whole heart goes out to Chittagong in its dire calamity. May the survivors bear it with fortitude.
 Correspondents continue to ask all sorts of questions about appointments of Governors, Ministers and the like, as if I was  a member of the Congress Working Committee or could affect its decisions. I know and admit that I have and shall always retain by right of service a place in the hearts of Congressmen.  I know too that   I shall forfeit that place immediately I begin to overstep my limits. Legal status I have none, moral status can be retained only so long as the moral platform is firmly held.
 Do you agree that the leaders of both the communities should go to East and West Bengal and show that they have no differences now to quarrel over?
My answer is emphatically yes, if the leaders are one at heart.  If
 the word belies the thought, the going about will be worse  than  useless. The newspaper war still continues. I would always prefer an open war to the war of hearts. Are we sure that the leaders trust one another? My fear is that neither at the top nor at the bottom are we cleansed of hypocrisy. I can, therefore, but repeat my old argument that we must unlearn the habit of retaliation in every shape and form.
 Blow for blow is a crude form and probably more excusable than the subtle one of evil thought for its kind. Thought is the root of speech and deed. I am sorry that I am unable to return a more comfortable answer. There is none that I know. This is said to hearten ourselves, not to dishearten us. For I have said the naked truth. Within my experience it ever heartens. Is it not heartening to know the true remedy for a disease? Any other is a palliative and in the end aggravates the disease.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       SODEPUR, 
  August 	12, 1947  Gandhiji 	said that the 15th 	instant was 	to be a 	landmark in 	India’s history. It 	was a 	day when 	India would be declared 	free of 	the foreign 	yoke. It 	was to 	be an independent 	nation. He had 	explained how 	the day was to be 	observed,libtech_311_footnotebut he 	was probably 	alone in the view. 	Already there was an 	announcement that the 	Muslims of 	Calcutta were to observe 	it as a day 	of mourning. 	He hoped 	that it was 	not true. No 	man could be 	compelled to 	observe the 	day in a 	particular manner. It 	was to 	be a perfectly 	voluntary act. He would 	ask his Muslim 	countrymen not to mourn 	over the freedom. 	The present 	distemper was to go. What 	were the Hindus 	in Pakistan 	to do? 	They should 	salute the Pakistan 	Flag if 	it meant the freedom 	and equality 	of all 	in every 	respect, irrespective of 	caste, colour or 	creed. He 	had heard further that on 	that day 	the Indians in 	the French 	and Portuguese 	possessions were to 	declare their freedom 	from France and Portugal respectively.  That, 	he said, 	would be a 	thoughtless act. 	It would 	be a 	sign perhaps 	of arrogance. 	The British 	were retiring, not 	the French and the 	Portuguese. He, undoubtedly, 	held the view 	that the Indians 	in these 	possessions were bound to 	merge in Independent 	India in 	good time. Only the 	Indians in 	those territories 	should not take 	the law in 	their own 	hands. They had 	constitutional means 	open to them 	and then 	there was their 	Chief Minister who 	had vindicated the 	freedom of 	Indonesia. Surely, 	he was 	not going to neglect 	his own kith and kin in 	the two possessions. 	If they 	had any doubt 	about the validity 	of his 	advice, they 	should act on 	Panditiji’s advice.  He 	then came to 	another important 	subject. They knew that 	he prolonged 	his stay 	in Calcutta 	by two 	days at the 	instance of 	Muslim friends. Last 	night Shaheed Saheb 	Suhrawardy had come to see him. He had suggested that it would be 	contrary to his 	(Gandhiji’s) practice 	to leave 	Calcutta while it was 	going through the 	horrors of 	communal strife. Shaheed Saheb had suggested that Gandhiji should prolong his stay    
 in the city and work until real peace was restored. Gandhiji had replied that  Suhrawardy Saheb and he should live under the same roof in the disturbed parts. It would be best to live unprotected by the police or the military. In brotherly fashion, they would approach the people, argue with them and tell them that now that partition had taken place by agreement, there was no longer any reason why the parties should quarrel. The decision of the Boundary Commission was going to be announced in a day or two, and it was in the fitness of things that all the parties should abide by the decision in a becoming manner. After all, the parties had appointed an arbitration tribunal. They were in honour bound to abide by the Award whatever it was.
 Gandhiji’s proposal to Suhrawardy Saheb was of such an important nature that the latter could not afford to give a hasty reply. Gandhiji had, therefore, asked Shaheed Saheb to consult his aged father as well as his daughter before coming to a decision.
 During the afternoon, Mr. Usman, the ex-Mayor of Calcutta, had arrived with Shaheed Saheb’s message stating that the latter had accepted Gandhiji’s proposal without reservation. It was now time, therefore, for the two friends to choose quarters in the midst of the worst-affected areas and see what could be done by joint effort.
 Gandhiji said that he was warned that Shaheed Saheb was not to be relied upon. The same thing was said about him (Gandhiji) also. He was des- cribed as the worst enemy of Islam. He was supposed to be a consummate hypocrite. God alone knew men’s hearts. He asserted that he spoke and acted as he believed. He had known Shaheed Saheb since the days of the Faridpore Conferencelibtech_312_footnote, to which the late Deshbandhu had taken him. Nobody had any right to prejudge anybody. He would trust as he expected to be trusted. Both would live under the same roof, and have no secrets from each other. They would together see all the visitors. People should have the courage to speak out the truth under all circumstances and in the presence of those against whom it had to be said.
 Gandhiji finally referred to what the common citizens could do in order to help the cause. They were to bless them on the mission on which they were embarking.

   DISCUSSION WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF DEMONSTRATORSlibtech_319_footnote  
 HYDARI  MANSION,  CALCUTTA,
 August 13, 1947
 Presently the representatives of the demonstrators were ushered in to meet Gandhiji. One of them began :
 Last year when Direct Action was launched on the Hindus on August 16, you did not come to our rescue. Now that there has been just a little trouble in the Muslim quarters, you have come running to their succour. We don’t want you here.
GANDHIJI: Much water has flown under the bridge since August
 1946. What the Muslims did then was utterly wrong. But what is the use of avenging the year 1946 on 1947? I was on  my  way  to Noakhali where your own kith and kin desired my presence. But I now see that I shall have to serve Noakhali only from here. You must understand that I have come here to serve not only Muslims but Hindus, Muslims and all alike. Those who are indulging in brutalities are bringing dis-grace upon  themselves and the religion they represent. I am going to put myself under your protection. You are welcome to turn against me and play the opposite role if you so choose. I have nearly reached the end of my life’s journey. I have not much farther to go.  But let  me tell you that if you again go mad,  I will not be a living witness to it. I have given the same ultimatum to the Muslims of Noakhali also; I have earned the right. Before there is another outbreak of Muslim madness in Noakhali, they will find me dead. Why cannot you see that by taking this step I have put the burden of the peace of Noakhali on the shoulders of Shaheed Suhrawardy and his friends—including men like  Mian Ghulam Sarwar and the rest? This is no small gain.
 
 
 Gandhiji’s car arrived. They shouted : ‘Why have you come here ? You did not come when we were in trouble. Now that the Muslims have complained all this fuss is being made over it.  Why did you not go to places from where Hindus have fled?’ . . .
 The situation threatened to take an ugly turn. Gandhiji sent some of his men outside  to expostulate with the demonstrators and tell them to send in their representatives to meet him.”
 
 We do not want your sermons on ahimsa. You go away from here. We won’t allow the Muslims to live here.
This means that you do not want my services. If you will co-
 operate with me and allow me to carry on my work, it will enable the Hindus to return and to live in all the places from where they have been driven out. On the other hand, it will profit you nothing to remember old wrongs and nurse old enmities.
 An eighteen-year-old youngster interposed:
 History shows that Hindus and Muslims can never be friends. Anyway, ever since I was born I have seen them only fighting each other.
GANDHIJI: Well, I have seen more of history than anyone of you,
 and I tell you that I have known Hindu boys who called Muslims ‘uncle’. Hindus and Muslims used to participate in each other’s festivals and other auspicious occasions. You want to force me to leave this place but you should know that I have never submitted to force. It is contrary to my nature. You can obstruct my work, even kill me. I won’t invoke the help of the police. You can prevent me from leaving this house, but what is the use of your dubbing me an enemy of the Hindus ? I will not accept the lable. To make me quit, you have to convince me that I have made a mistake in coming here.
 Thus it went on till eight o’clock. At last Gandhiji said :
 I put it to you, young men, how can I, who am a Hindu by birth,  a Hindu by creed and a Hindu of Hindus in my way of living, be an ‘enemy’ of Hindus? Does this not show narrow intolerance on your part?
 His words had a profound effect. Slowly and imperceptibly the opposition began to soften. Still they were not completely converted. One of them said: “Perhaps we should now go.” Gandhiji replied :
Yes, you must go. It is already late. Come again in the morning
when you have thought things over.libtech_320_footnote

    LETTER TO SUSHILA GANDHI        CALCUTTA, 
     CHI. 	SUSHILA,  August 	14, 1947 
  	I had received your letter, but could get no time at all to reply to 	it. I am writing this after the morning prayer. I am being fairly 	severely tested here. Instead of going on to Noakhali, I have got 	stuck here. Yesterday I came here to live in a Muslim’s house. 	This one fact, however, will not give you a complete picture of the 	situation and  I have no time to write more.  	You are unnecessarily taking things to heart. Manilal’s letter is 	so transparent and so innocent. He has only poured out his heart in 	it. You had a right to draw the inference you did from the previous 	letter. Notwithstanding his own desire he had no objection to your 	staying on in Akola. But that letter did not reveal all he had in 	mind. You should now join him at the earliest opportunity.  	Sita will have what is destined for her. I don’t know what I shall 	be able to do. This time my train passed through Banaras. But it was 	late by four hours and Sita could not have come to the station at 	that time of night. But I think you yourself will be in a better 	position to think over the matter and decide. It is useless to come 	and see me. Rama alone knows where I shall be tomorrow. It looks 	like I shall be here. But if I am not here, where will you go 	wandering after me? If you need the advice of an elder, Kishorelal 	is there. You are bound to benefit by following his advice. What 	does it matter if our views do not agree? Each individual thinks 	differently. Maybe in this matter both of us think alike. But that 	need not worry you. You should do only what seems right to you. I 	have made the above suggestion in case you cannot do that. Manilal’s 	letter is enclosed. Though it was in my file, nobody is likely to 	have read it. Everybody abides by the restrictions I place on them. 	The file is not likely to fall into any stranger’s hands these 	days. There are only three persons with me, Bisenlibtech_334_footnote,  Abha or Radha (Manu).  But what does it matter who 	is with me? What can you have which you might want to keep private?    
 Manilal’s and your letters are never sentimental. I, therefore, think that anybody who reads them is bound to learn something from them.
 Remain calm and take every step after careful thinking. If you have any attachments overcome them.
 If you reply to  this letter,	address it C/o Khadi Pratishthan, Sodepur.
 Krishna wasn’t there either in  Kashmir or Lahore. I am getting a copy made of this.

   DISCUSSION WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF DEMONSTRATORSlibtech_335_footnote  
 August 14, 1947
 Gandhiji pointed out to them that united action on the part of Suhrawardy and himself in Beliaghata was only the first step. If and when the Hindus of Beliaghata invited their Muslim neighbours to return, they would next move to a predominantly Muslim area, where they would stay till the Hindus were invited to return and so on till each community had invited its neighbours to return to their former houses all over Calcutta. This time the young men were completely won over.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_336_footnote  
 BELIAGHATA, CALCUTTA,
 August 14, 1947 He first said that the next day was the day fixed for deliverance from the foreign yoke.  It was, therefore, a great day.  They were bound to celebrate it.  In his
 opinion it was a day when both the Dominions were to shoulder a heavy burden. He invited everyone to have twenty-four hours’ fast and prayer during the day for the well-being of India as a whole and pass it in spinning as much as possible. For it was hand-spinning that had knit the poor and the rich together and that had given occupation to countless men and women who were without occupation.
 
 He then returned to the reason for his postponing the visit to Noakhali and coming to stay in the present place. He said that Shaheed Saheb had come to see him and induce him to do his bit in bringing about peace in Calcutta which was burning. The appeal had its effect upon him.  He agreed provided Shaheed Saheb went with him  to the affected areas and stayed there under the same roof with him, till the fury had abated and till complete friendship between the two communities was restored. Therefore, they were to work with one mind without mental reservation and without any secrets in the matter from one another. Shaheed Saheb had taken one night to confer with his aged father and his daughter and had sent over his decision the next day.libtech_337_footnoteAnd he had sent one message which brought them to the present place yesterday. He had had many warnings also against Shaheed Saheb.  He was unaffected  by the warnings. He was bound to believe his word as he expected him to accept his (Gandhiji’s) word. Let them not think that they were to neglect the parts of Calcutta which were deserted by their Hindu inhabitants and were occupied by Muslims. They were working for the peace of the whole of Calcutta and he invited his audience to believe with them that if Calcutta returned to sanity and  real  friendship,  then Noakhali and the rest of India would be safe. He mentioned that Shaheed Saheb was in the building, but he had, with his consent, kept himself away from the meeting as he wanted to avoid being the slightest cause of irritation to the meeting.libtech_338_footnoteBut he was glad that the audience had exhibited becoming tolerance and gave him the courage to bring Shaheed Saheb to the meeting. After all they should live and work together in the open and perfect co-operation if their difficult mission was to succeed.

 MY DEAR AGATHA,
 This letter I am dictating whilst I am spinning. You know, my way of celebrating great events, such as today’s, is to thank God for it and, therefore, to pray. This prayer must be accompanied by a fast, if
 
 listen to Suhrawardy, he beckoned him.	”  Suhrawardy’s unequivocal admission of
 responsibility for the ‘Great Calcutta Killing’ . . . had a profound effect on the crowd. ‘It was the turning point,’ Gandhiji afterwards remarked. ‘It had a cleansing effect, I could sense it.’ ”
 
 the taking of fruit juices may be so described. And then as a mark of identification with the poor and dedication there must be spinning. Hence I must not be satisfied with the spinning I do every day, but I must do as much as is possible in consistence with my other appointments.
 I got through Amrit your first letter at 4 o’clock  in  the  morning. I have through her your second letter. This has been brought by Rajaji, the Governor of West Bengal. Rajaji could not afford to come himself. The Government House is surrounded by a huge admiring crowd. He is, therefore, a prisoner in his own house. He sent his secretary with Rajkumari’s packet.
 You refer me to Winterton’s speech, which you will be surprised to learn, I  have not read.libtech_339_footnotelibtech_340_footnoteThe speeches during the debate on the Independence Bill, I was not able to read. I rarely get a moment to read newspapers. Some portions are either read to me or I glance during odd moments. What does it matter, who talks in my favour or against me, if I myself am sound at bottom? After all you and I have to do our duty in the best manner we know and keep on smiling. Rest from the papers. I am about to finish my spinning. Therefore I must think of other things.
 My love to all our friends. I was glad to find that Carl Heath was well enough to preside at the gathering described by you.

   LETTER TO RAMENDRA G. SINHA  
 BELIAGHATA, CALCUTTA,
 August 15, 1947
 DEAR FRIEND,
 I must take you at your word. As you say, your father had in him non-violence of the brave. Such a one never dies, destruction of the body has no meaning for him. Therefore, it is not right for you, your mother [or anyone]libtech_341_footnoteto mourn over the death   of  your  brave father. He has left, in dying, a rich legacy which I hope you will all deserve. The best advice I can give is that you should all do whatever you can for the building up of the freedom that has come to us today and the first thing you can do is to copy your father’s bravery.
 Bravery of non-violence is shown in a variety of ways, not necessarily in dying at the hands of an assassin. There is no doubt that if you earn an honest price for the [loss]libtech_342_footnotelibtech_343_footnoteof your [dear ones]libtech_344_footnotelibtech_345_footnotethat by itself will be a contribution to the preservation of the [dearly earned freedom].libtech_346_footnote

   ADVICE TO WEST BENGAL MINISTERS  
 August 15, 1947
 From today you have to wear the crown of thorns. Strive ceasel- essly to cultivate truth and non-violence. Be humble. Be forbearing. The British rule no doubt put you on your mettle. But now you will be tested through and through. Beware of power; power corrupts. Do not let yourselves be entrapped by its pomp  and pageantry. Remember, you are in office to serve the poor in India’s villages. May God help you.

   TALK WITH C. RAJAGOPALACHARI  
 CALCUTTA,
 August 15, 1947
 The new Governor of the province, C. Rajagopalachari, paid him a respectful visit and congratulated him on the “miracle which he had wrought”. But Gandhiji replied that he could not be satisfied until Hindus and Muslims felt safe in one another’s company and returned to their own homes to live as before. Without that change of heart, there was likelihood of future deterioration in spite of the present enthusiasm.

   TALK WITH COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS  
 CALCUTTA,
 August 15, 1947
 At 2, there was an interview with some members of the Communist Party of India to whom Gandhiji said that political workers, whether Communist or Socialist, must forget today all differences and help to consolidate the freedom which had been attained. Should we allow it to break into pieces? The tragedy was that the strength with which the country had fought against the British was failing them when it came to the establishment of Hindu-Muslim unity.
 With regard to the celebrations, Gandhiji said:
 I can’t afford to take part in this rejoicing, which is a sorry affair.

 Gandhiji explained in detail why the fighting must stop now. We had two States now, each of which was to have both Hindu and Muslim citizens. If that were so, it meant an end of the two-nation theory. Students ought to think and think well. They should do no wrong. It was wrong to molest an Indian citizen merely because he professed a different religion. Students should do everything to build up a new State  of India which would be everybody’s pride. With regard to the demonstration of fraternization he said:
I am not lifted off my feet by these demonstrations of joy.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_347_footnote        CALCUTTA, 
  August 15, 1947 Gandhiji congratulated Calcutta on Hindus and Muslims meeting together in perfect friendliness. Muslims shouted the same slogans of joy as the Hindus. They  flew 	the tricolour without the 	slightest hesitation. 	What was more, 	the Hindus 	were admitted 	to mosques 	and Muslims 	were admitted to the 	Hindu mandirs. 	This news 	reminded him 	of the 	Khilafat days 	when Hindus and 	Muslims fraternized with 	one another. 	If this 	exhibition was 	from the heart and was not a 	momentary impulse, it 	was better 	than the Khilafat 	days. The simple 	reason was that 	they had both 	drunk the poison 	cup of disturbances. 	The nectar 	of friendliness 	should, therefore, taste sweeter 	than before. 	He was 	however sorry 	to hear 	that in a 	certain part 	the poor 	Muslims experienced 	molestation. He hoped 	that Calcutta 	including Howrah will be 	entirely free 	from the communal virus for ever. Then indeed they need have no fear 	about East Bengal and 	the rest of 	India.  He 	was sorry, therefore, to 	hear that madness still 	reged in Lahore. 	He could 	hope and feel sure that 	the noble example of 	Calcutta, if 	it was sincere, 	would affect the 	Punjab and 	the other parts of 	India. He 	then referred 	to Chittagong. 	Rain was 	no respecter 	of persons. 	It engulfed both 	Muslims and 	Hindus. It 	was the duty 	of the 	whole of 	Bengal to 	feel one 	with the 	sufferers of 	Chittagong.  He 	then referred 	to the 	fact thet the people 	realizing that India 	was free, 	took possession of 	the Government 	House and in 	affection besieged their 	new Governor Rajaji. 	 He would be glad if it meant only a token of the people’s power. 	But he would  be sick 	and sorry 	if the 	people thought 	that they could do 	what they liked with the 	Government and other 	property. That 	would be criminal 	lawlessness. He hoped, 	therefore, that they had 	of their 	own accord 	vacated the Governor’s 	palace as readily 	as they 	had occupied 	it. He would 	warn the people 	that now that 	they were free, they 	would use the freedom 	with wise restraint. They should know that they were to 	treat the 	Europeans who 	stayed in 	India with the 	same regard as 	they would expect for 	themselves. They 	must know that they were masters 	of no one 	but of themselves. 	They must not compel anyone to do anything against his will.  Harijan, 	24-8-1947          
  
   MIRACLE OR ACCIDENT?libtech_348_footnote  
 Shaheed Saheb Suhrawardy and I are living together in  a  Muslim manzil in Beliaghata where Muslims have been reported to be sufferers. We occupied the house on Wednesday the 13th instant and on the 14th it seemed as if there never had been bad blood between the Hindus and the Muslims. In their thousands they began  to  embrace one another and they began to pass freely through places which were considered to be points of danger by one party or the other. Indeed, Hindus were taken to their masjids by their Muslim brethren and the latter were taken by their Hindu brethren to the mandirs. Both with one voice shouted “Jai Hind”  or “Hindu- Muslims! Be one”. As I have said above, we are living in a Muslim’s house and Muslim volunteers are attending to our comforts with the greatest attention. Muslim volunteers do the cooking. Many were eager to come from the Khadi Pratishthan for attendance, but I prevented them. I was determined that we should be fully satisfied with whatever the Muslim brothers and sisters were able to give for our creature comforts and I must say that the determination has resulted in unmixed good. Here in the compound numberless Hindus and Muslims continue to stream in shouting the favourite slogans. One might almost say that the joy of fraternization is leaping up from hour to hour.
 Is this to be called a miracle or an accident? By whatever name  it may be described, it is quite clear that all the credit that is being given to me from all sides is quite undeserved; nor can it be said to be deserved by Shaheed Saheb. This sudden upheaval is not the work of one or two men. We are toys in the hands of God. He makes us dance to His tune. The utmost therefore, that man can do is to refrain from interfering with the dance and that he should render full obedience to his Maker’s will. Thus considered, it can be said that in this miracle He has used us two as His instruments and as for myself I only ask whether the dream of my youth is to be realized in the evening of my life.
 For those who have full faith in God, this is neither a miracle nor an accident. A chain of events can be clearly seen to show that the two were being prepared, unconsciously to themselves, for fraternization.
 
 In this process our advent on the scene enabled the onlooker to give us credit for the consummation of the happy event.
 Be that as it may, the delirious happenings remind me of the early days of the Khilafat movement. The fraternization then burst on the public as a new experience. Moreover, we had then the Khilafat and swaraj as our twin goals. Today we have nothing of the kind. We have drunk the poison of mutual hatred and so this nectar of fraternization tastes all the sweeter and the sweetness should never wear out.
 In the present exuberance one hears also the cry of ‘Long Live Hindustan and Pakistan,’ from the joint throats of the Hindus and the Muslims. I think it is quite proper. Whatever was the cause for the agreement, three parties accepted Pakistan. If then the two are not enemies one of the other, and here evidently they are not, surely there is nothing wrong in the above cry. Indeed, if the two have become friends, not to wish long life to both the States would probably be an act of disloyalty.

  	Your two letters the same day. It was impossible for me to write to 	you before. This I am writing just after the morning prayer. Your 	letter together with the other post I read yesterday after the 	morning prayer and the time for the walk was on. During the day 	there is hardly any quiet. I am in a Muslim house. They are all very 	good. I have taken no one from Sodepur. Hence the help I need comes 	only from Muslim friends. This is not for me a new experience. It 	reminds me of old days in South Africa and the Khilafat days here. 	For the moment I am no enemy. Who knows how long this will last? 	Hindus and Muslims have become friends practically in a day.  	Suhrawardy has become transformed, so it looks. His association was 	the condition of my stay in the disturbed area of Calcutta.

Everyone living 	in it should 	be entitled 	to profess 	his religion 	without let or 	hindrance, so 	long  as 	the citizen 	obeyed the common 	law of 	the land.

 did during the foreign regime.
 While discussing these matters with Principal Kellas, Gandhiji incidentally remarked that although we had thrown overboard British political supremacy, we have not yet been able to throw overboard the cultural one. In his characteristic style, he said:
 We have discarded foreign power, not the unseen foreign influence.
 What he would like the new India of his dream to do was to lay the foundation of a new life in keeping with its natural surroundings. In every State in the world today, violence, even if it were for so-called defensive purposes only, enjoyed a status which was in conflict with the better elements of life.
 ‘The organization of the best in society,’ was the aim to which new India should dedicate herself; and this could be done only if we succeeded in demolishing the status which had been given to goondaism today.
 One of the scientist members of the staff then asked Gandhiji what scientific men should do if they were now asked by the free Indian Government to engage in researches in furtherance of war and the atom bomb? Gandhiji promptly replied:
Scientists to be worth the name should resist such a State unto
death.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        CALCUTTA, 
  August 	16, 1947 Gandhiji 	expressed his pleasure that at the Chittaranjan Seva Sadan  the tricolour was hoisted by 	an elderly Harijan Mehtrani 	who is faithfully 	serving the  institution. 	Similarly, for a 	District Congress 	Committee (of which 	he had 	forgotten the 	name for 	the moment), a 	Harijan girl performed 	the hoisting 	ceremony. This was along 	right lines and in 	keeping with 	the present fraternal 	spirit of 	Calcutta. He 	hoped that the 	spirit was 	permanent and 	that there would be 	no trace of 	untouchability or 	inequality in 	Hinduism and 	that Hindus and 	Muslims being 	from the same God, would 	never quarrel among one 	another. If 	this spirit 	persisted, it 	would spread 	throughout the length and breadth of India.  Then there would be no 	fear of disturbance  in Noakhali 	or the Punjab.  He 	then proceeded to refer to the crowd taking possession of the 	Government House. Historians have testified that in ancient India, 	people had no need to lock 
 their doors. In Ramarajya thefts were not known. Such is our tradition of honesty and truth. It was a matter of shame that there was a show of the military to induce the crowd to vacate the Government House. He was also grieved to learn that some plate in the Government House was pilfered. He would be glad to find that the plate was returned to the Government House. He then mentioned that an American friend who was the Qaid-e-Azam told him the day before that the Qaid-e-Azam said that India would show to the world that there was no longer any quarrel between the two and that there was no majority and minority community. Rajaji, their Governor, confirmed the same information.

   AN INDIAN GOVERNOR  
 In construing the word India, here it includes both Hindostan and Pakistan. Hindustan may mean the country of the Hindus strictly so called, Pakistan may mean the country of the Muslims. Both the uses are,in my opinion, irregular. Hence, I have purposely use the word Hindostan.
 The Khilafat-Swaraj-Non-co-operation Resolution of 1920 passed in Calcutta at the Special Session of the Congresslibtech_356_footnotelibtech_357_footnote, which has brought freedom from the British yoke, was for both the Hindus and the Muslims, designed to induce self-purification so as to bring about non-co-operation between forces of evil and those of good. Hence
  An 	Indian Governor should, 	in his 	own person and 	in his 	surroundings, be 	a teetotaller. 	Without this, 	prohibition of 	the fiery 	liquid is well-nigh inconceivable.  He 	and his surroundings 	should represent 	hand-spinning as a visible token of identification with the dumb millions of India, a 
 
 
 token of the necessity of ‘bread labour’ and organized non-violence as against organized violence on which the society of today seems to be based.
  He 	must dwell 	in a 	cottage accessible to 	all, though 	easily shielded 	from gaze, 	if he is to do efficient 	work.  The British  Governor 	naturally represented British might. 	For him and his was 	erected a 	fortified residence—a 	palace to be occupied 	by him 	and his numerous 	vassals who sustained 	his Empire. The 	Indian prototype 	may keep 	somewhat pretentious 	buildings for receiving 	princes and ambassadors 	of the 	world. For 	these, being 	guests of 	the Governor, 	should constitute an 	education in 	what “Even Unto This 	Last”— equality 	of all—should mean 	in concrete 	terms.  For 	 him no expensive 	furniture, foreign or 	indigenous. Plain living 	and high 	thinking must 	be his motto, not to 	adorn his 	entrance but to 	be exemplified in 	daily life.  For 	him there can 	be no untouchability 	in any 	form whatsoever, 	no caste 	or creed 	or colour 	distinction. He must 	represent the 	best of 	all religions 	and all things 	Eastern or Western. 	Being a 	citizen of 	India, he 	must be 	a citizen 	of the 	world. Thus 	simply, one reads, did 	the Khalif Omar, with 	millions of 	treasures at 	his feet, 	live; thus 	lived Janaka of ancient 	times; thus lived, as I 	saw him, the 	Master of Eton 	in his 	residence in 	the midst of 	, and 	surrounded by, 	the sons of the 	Lords and 	Nabobs of 	the British 	Isles. Will the 	Governors of 	India of 	the famished millions do less?  He 	will speak the 	language of 	the province 	of which 	he is 	the Governor 	and Hindustani, 	the lingua 	franca of India 	written in the 	Nagari or 	Urdu script. 	This is neither 	Sanskritized Hindi 	nor Persianized 	Urdu. Hindustani 	is emphatically 	the language 	which is 	spoken by 	the millions 	north of the 	Vindhya Range. 
 This does not pretend to be an exhaustive list of the virtues that an Indian Governor should represent. It is merely illustrative.
 One would expect that the Britishers who have been chosen by Indian representatives as Governors and who have taken the oath of fealty to India and her millions would endeavour as far as possible to live the life an Indian Governor is expected to live. They  will represent the best that their country has to give to India and the world.

   GOD IS GOOD  
 Not in the same sense as X is good. X is comparatively good. He is more good than evil, but God is wholly good. There is no evil in Him. God made man in His own image. Unfortunately for us man has fashioned Him in his own. This arrogation has landed man- kind in a sea of troubles. God is the Supreme Alchemist. In His presence  all iron and dross turn into pure gold. Similarly does all evil turn into good.
 Again God lives but not as we. His creatures live but to die. But God is life. Therefore goodness and all it connotes is not an attribute. Goodness is God. Goodness conceived as apart from Him is a lifeless thing and exists only whilst it is a paying policy. So are all morals. If they are to live in us they must be considered and cultivated in their relation to God. We try to become good because we want to reach and realize God. All the dry ethics of the world turn to dust because apart from God they are lifeless. Coming from God, they come with life in them. They become part of us and ennoble us.
 Conversely God conceived without Goodness is without life. We give him life in our vain imaginings.

    SPEECH AT NARKELDANGAlibtech_360_footnote        CALCUTTA, 
  [August 17, 1947]libtech_361_footnoteGandhiji said 	that there were 	indications that 	all was not well with the Muslims. Some Hindus were now beginning to feel that they had the upper hand, and  some 	Muslims were 	afraid that 	they would have to play 	the underdog in 	the Union 	today. Gandhiji said 	that this would be 	shameful indeed. 	If a 	minority in 	India, minority 	on the 	score of 	its religious 	profession, was made to 	feel small 	on that 	account, he 	could only say 	that this India was 	not the India of 	his dreams. In 	the India for whose 	fashioning he had 	worked all 	his life every man 	enjoyed equality of 	status, whatever 	his religion 	was. The State 	was bound 	to be wholly 	secular.  He went 	so far as to say 	that no denominational 	educational institution in 	it should enjoy State 	patronage.  All 	subjects would thus 	be equal 	in the 	eye of the 	law. But every single 	individual would be 	free to 	pursue his 	own religion without let 	or hindrance 	so long 	 as it did 	not transgress the 	common law. The 	question of 	the protection 	of minorities 	was not good enough for 	him; it rested 	upon the recognition 	of religious 	grouping between 	citizens of the same State. What  he 	wished India 	to do, 	was to assure 	liberty of religious 	profession to every 	single individual. Then 	only India could be 	great, for 	it was perhaps the 	one nation in 	the ancient 	world, which had 	recognized cultural 	democracy, whereby it was 	held that 	the roads to God were 	many, but the goal was one, because God was one and the same.  In 	fact the roads were as many as there were individuals in the world.  Harijan, 	31-8-1947      SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_362_footnote      CALCUTTA,  August 	17, 1947  Gandhiji 	said that it was well for Shaheed Saheb to speak sweet things. They 	were justified. There was no exaggeration in his speech. But he felt 	bound to draw attention to certain disturbing things. They should 	not be drowned in the pardonable      
 exuberance they were witnessings. There were isolated spots in Calcutta where it was  not all well. He had heard that in one spot the Hindu residents were not prepared to welcome back the Muslim residents who were obliged to leave their places. All this was bad. It was like a bad boil in an otherwise wholesome body. If the boils were not looked after in time, they might poison the body.
 Then he mentioned a letter he had received from Mahammed Habibullah Bahar. Secretary of the Muslim League. He made a worthy suggestion about  a  joint influential committee going to the East and West of Bengal and consolidate the good work being done in Calcutta. He hoped the suggestion would be quickly acted upon. Another suggestion was that the havoc caused by the flood in the East Bengal should be a joint concern of the Hindus and the Musalmans. He agreed and hoped that there would be a body of Hindu and Muslim workers who would tackle the subject efficiently. Both grain and workers were wanted more than money. The Mayor of Calcutta had sent him a cheque for Rs.15,000 in aid of relief. He was thankful for the cheque. He would see to it that it was well employed.
 Gandhiji then turned to Chandranagore from which the news was received that the Administrator’s bungalow was surrounded by those who called themselves satya- grahis but were in fact duragrahis, if the statement received by him was true. It was suggested that he had approved of the step. He must say it was wholly untrue. Some persons had come to him and he had said that this was no time for satyagraha. There never could be any for duragraha. Pandit Nehru was there to look after such affairs. After all the French were a great people, lovers of liberty.  They must not be subjected   to any strain by India which had come in possession of liberty. India was bound to protect the French possessions in India against any untoward action by the Indians. So he was glad that the Chief Minister had proceeded to Chandranagore to find out the truth and do what he could.
 Continuing, Gandhiji dealt with way in which the people were treating the police who were posted to protect Shaheed Saheb and him. It was most improper to disregard the police instructions. He had seen them undertaking their difficult task with exemplary patience and courtesy. It was wrong for crowds to take the law in their own hands. That way lay slavery, not freedom. He warned the public that he was thinking of approaching the authorities to withdraw their forces, for he did not like them to be subjected to insult for doing a public duty. He, however, expected that the crowd would become perfectly orderly, so that the contemplated withdrawal might not  be necessary. The police and the military today were after all servants of the public and not their masters.
 Lastly, Gandhiji referred to the coming Id celebration. For twenty years in South Africa he had participated in the celebration with Muslim friends in masjids. Now that a flood of goodwill was sweeping over the city of Calcutta, he expected
 everyone to take such steps as would render the friendly feeling permanent. It was easy to share in a rising tide of emotion; but it was quite another matter to produce constructive workers who would toil from day to day in order to consolidate the feeling. Gandhiji would love to see such work in the city, for, he was sure that its effect would then be felt by the rest of the country. If they failed to do this, Gandhiji warned them, today’s freedom would prove only a nine-day wonder.

 This does not mean that you should get a new one. Of course, if a watch with radium and alarm was available, I would surely exchange. But even that for how long? Our days are now numbered. We must be resigned to whatever we get. If something improper is presented, we must put it aside. But I am digressing.
 The watch seems to be keeping accurate time. How is it that Urmila does not come to lend her shoulder? Let her study a lot. But she should not fall prey to the present-day business. You must have understood what I am hinting at.

Because of the misdeeds of the majority, who were Hindus in Kanchraparalibtech_369_footnotelibtech_370_footnote,  the 	Chief Minister, Shaheed 	Saheb, he and 	others had 	to go to Kanchrapara. 	Then on return 	they were stopped by 	parties who 	wanted to 	acclaim their 	joy.

He then 	warned them 	against being 	unduly elated by all 	the fraternization that 	they were witnessing. 	Behind it there 	were pointers like 	Barrackpore,libtech_371_footnoteKanchrapara and 	other places he 	could mention. He 	would not 	let them plead excuse or 	extenuation. There was 	neither excuse 	nor extenuation for the majority in Pakistan or Hindustan.  If the Hindu majority treasured     
 their religion and duty, they would be just at all cost. They would overlook the limitations or mistakes of the minority who had no one but the majority to look to for justice. He had to listen not without shame and sorrow to the statement that a Muslim  friend made to him.  He said with a sigh that there was nothing left but a kind   of subjection to the Hindu majority and they might have to suffer in silence the playing of music before mosques whilst they were offering prayers. He would have no such despair on the part of Muslims. The friend, who made the remark, did not realize that he unconsciously implied that Muslims majority would inflict revenge in Pakistan. He hoped it would never be so either in Hindustan or Pakistan. The proper thing was each majority to do their duty in all humility, irrespective of what the other majority did in the other State. He suggested , therefore, that until the Prime Ministers of Pakistan and the Union agreed upon another course in both the States, the practice that was followed during the British regime often under compulsion, should be fully and voluntarily followed in both the States. Those who thought that they could haughtily impose their will on the minority were foolish and were vastly mistaken. If, therefore, they wanted to consolidate the prevailing goodwill, they would see to it that they acted on the square under all circumstances.

   TALK WITH STUART NELSONlibtech_372_footnote  
 
 CALCUTTA,
 [Before August 20, 1947]libtech_373_footnote
 Professor Nelson asked him why it was that Indians who had more or less successfully gained independence through peaceful means, were now unable to check the tide of civil war through the same means?
 Gandhiji replied that it was indeed a searching question which he must answer. He confessed that it had become clear to him that what he had mistaken for satyagraha was not satyagraha but passive resistance—a weapon of the weak. Indians harboured  ill will and anger against their erstwhile rulers, while they pretended to resist them non-violently. Their resistance was, therefore, inspired by violence and not a by regard for the man in the British,whom they should convert through satyagraha.
 
 
 Now that the British were voluntarily quitting India, apparent non-violence had gone to pieces in a moment. The attitude of violence which we had secretly harboured, in spite of the restraint imposed by the Indian National Congress, now recoiled upon us and made us fly at each other’s throats when the question of the distribution of power came up. If India could now discover a way of sublimating the force of violence which had taken a communal turn, and turning it into constructive, peaceful ways, whereby differences of interests could be liquidated, it would be a great day indeed.
 Gandhiji then proceeded to say that is was indeed true that many English friends had warned him that the so-called non-violent non-co-operation of India was not really non-violent. It was the passivity of the weak and not the non-violence of the stout in heart who would never surrender their sense of human unity and brotherhood even in the midst of conflict of interests, who would even try to convert and not coerce their adversary.
 Gandhiji procceded to say that this was indeed true. He had all along laboured under an illusion. But he was never sorry for it. He realized that if his vision were  not covered by that illusion, India would never have reached the point which it had today.
 India was now free, and the reality was now clearly revealed to him. Now that the burden of subjection had been lifted, all the forces of good had to be marshalled in one great effort to build a country which forsook the accustomed method of violence in order to settle human conflicts whether it was between two States or between two sections of the same people. He had yet the faith that India would rise to the occasion and prove to the world that the birth of two new States would be, not a menace, but a blessing to the rest of mankind. It was the duty of Free India to perfect the instrument of non-violence for dissolving collective conflicts, if its freedom was going to be really worth-while.

    TALK WITH STUDENTS        CALCUTTA, 
  [Before 	August 20, 1947]  Gandhiji 	first asked them if any of them had taken part in the riots, to 	which they replied in the negative. Whatever they had done was in 	self-defence; hence it was no part of the riot. 
 This gave Gandhiji an opportunity of speaking on some of the vital problems connected with non-violence. He said that mankind had all along tried to justify violence and war in terms of unavoidable self-defence. It was a simple rule that the violence of the aggressor could only defeated by superior violence of the defender. All over the world, men had thus been caught in a mad race for armaments, and no one yet knew at what point of time the world would be really safe enough for turning the sword into the plough. Mankind, he stated, had not yet mastered the true art of self- defence.
 But great teachers, who had practised what they preached, had successfully shown that true defence lay along the path of non-retaliation. It might sound paradoxical; but this is what he meant. Violence always thrived on counter-violence. The aggressor had always a purpose behind his attack; he wanted something to be done, some object to be surrendered by the defender. Now, if the defender steeled his heart and was determined not to surrender even one inch, and at the same time to resist the temptation of matching the violence of the aggressor by violence, the latter could be made to realize in a short while that it would not be paying to punish the other party and his will could not be imposed in that way. This would involve suffering. It was this unalloyed self-suffering which was the truest form of self-defence which knew no surrender.
 Someone might ask how it could be called self-defence if through such non- resistance the defender was likely to lose his life. Jesus lost his life on the Cross and the Roman Pilate won. Gandhiji did not agree. Jesus had won, as the world’s history had abundantly shown. What did it matter if the body was dissolved in the process, so long as by Christ’s act of non-resistance, the forces of good were released in society?
 This art of the self-defence by means of which man gained his life by losing it, had been mastered and exemplified in the history of individuals. The method had not been perfected for application by large masses of mankind. India’s satyagraha was a very imperfect experiment in that direction. Hence, during the Hindu-Muslim quarrel, it proved a failure on the whole.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_383_footnote       CALCUTTA, 
  August 	20, 1947  Gandhiji 	drew attention to Chittagong and said that it was their duty to 	collect funds, distribute food and clothing and medical necessaries. 	Enough volunteers should be sent to afford relief. He was glad to 	find that the Marwari Relief Society as also the Friends’ Service 	Unit under Mr. Muirhead had already sent workers to the scene.  Referring 	to the Punjab, 	Gandhiji said that he had 	received letters to 	the effect that now that 	there was 	peace in 	Calcutta, he 	should proceed to 	the Punjab. 	He said 	that when God called 	him, he 	would most 	certainly go 	there. But 	the two Prime Ministers 	of the 	two Dominions had 	announced that their 	major preoccupation would 	be to restore 	complete peace in 	the Punjab. 	They would use every 	resource at 	their disposal to 	establish peace 	and they would mobilize 	public opinion in the 	Punjab. This 	should be enough 	for them 	to hope 	that things in the Punjab 	would be as good 	as in 	Calcutta. The 	two Prime Minister of 	the Punjab and 	Master Tara Singh and 	Master Giani 	Kartar Singh have said likewise.  Mentioning 	about the Central Peace Committee, Gandhiji said that it should 	consolidate the results so far achieved. They had to see that poor 	Muslims were rehabilitated just as the Hindus had to be 	rehabilitated in the areas from which they had been evacuated. Local 	peace committees should be set up in each mohalla; 	and     
 they must find at least one Hindu and one Muslim of clean heart to work together. These committees must tour the areas under their jurisdiction. They should work to create the feeling of friendliness wherever it was lacking. For the purpose of rehabilitation they would have to go into details. Food, shelter and clothing had to be found for the evacuees returning to their homes. It would be a great day indeed for Calcutta if its men and women co-operated in this manner to consolidate their good feelings, which had been so much in evidence during the last few days. In this task all  the parties were to co-operate. For, now that all the parties concerned had come to an agreement with regard to the division of India into two dominions, there was no longer any reason to quarrel and they could join hands in the task of restoring peaceful conditions.
 Gandhiji then referred to the question of flags. Personally he was of opinion that as the two States were on friendly terms with each other, there was no reason why they could not display each other’s flags in the two Dominons just as England and America could do.
 Gandhiji then referred to the proposal of stopping cow-slaughter by means of legislation in the Indian Union.  He said that he was of opinion that if they tried to do so through law, it would be a great mistake. He had been a devotee of the cow for over half a century. She had a permanent place in the economy of India. The cow can indeed be saved if they could win over the hearts of the Muslims in such a way that they voluntarily understood the responsiblity out of deference to the feelings of their Hindu friends. This had been abundantly demonstrated during the Khilafat days. Now that India was free, the same old relation could be restored if they behaved towards one another correctly.
 Hinduism, he lastly said, would be wrongly served if compelling legislation was resorted to in such matters. Hinduism could be saved only by doing unadulterated justice to man to whatever religion he might belong.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_385_footnote        CALCUTTA, 
  August 	21, 1947  Gandhiji 	drew attention to the 	two flags of 	Pakistan and 	the Indian Union that 	were being prominently 	flown among the audience 	and hoped 	that that pleasing sight 	would be universal 	in India. 	He was 	glad too that Shaheed 	Saheb had suggested 	the revival 	of the 	slogan ‘Hindu-Muslim 	ki Jai’, 	for it 	was started 	during the palmy 	Khilafat days. He 	recalled the memory of the old days when a Muslim fellow-prisoner 	used to sing Iqbal’s Sare 	Jahanse Achchha. He 	used to 	have it 	sung equally 	sweetly  by 	the late Saraladevi 	Chowdharani. The third 	time was this 	evening when he heard 	it sung 	with equal sweetness and 	force. The 	words of the 	poem were as sweet 	as the 	tune. And 	among them what could be 	sweeter than that 	religion never taught mutual 	hatred? He hoped and prayed that the beginning thus auspiciously 	made would last for ever 	and that 	they would never resort to 	the sword for 	the solution of 	their difficulties. 	If that 	was to be so, 	they would see 	that no untoward 	incidents were 	allowed to 	happen and 	flimsy things were 	not exaggerated 	so as to make 	them look like a communal 	disturbance as had come 	to his notice 	even that very day. He 	pleaded, too, 	that a 	strong rehabilitation 	committee might collect enough funds to 	give aid 	where it 	was required.  Absolute 	impartiality was needed 	to bring 	all the evacuees back to 	their places. 	There was a 	complaint that 	certain Muslims, who 	used to supply 	carts for 	transfer of 	goods from place to 	place, were displaced 	during the direct-action 	days. They 	had not found any 	other occupation. He 	was clear 	that if 	the state- 	ment was 	true, they 	should be 	reinstated. What 	was then to be done 	with the substitutes who 	were imported 	from other provinces? 	It was 	a ticklish 	question. But it 	was not 	beyond the 	wit of merchants. Where 	there was a will, 	there was a way. 	In scrupulous 	attention to 	such matters 	lay the foundation 	for permanent 	unity. There was, too, 	 the question 	of landlords 	taking undue advantage of 	the evacuees 	who were eager 	to return. 	They must not expect 	payment for the days 	that the  bustees 	 were unoccupied  or 	think of 	charging higher rents. He 	added that if 	they were quite honest in 	all their 	dealings both the 	communities were true to 	one another, he 	was sure that the 	union of 	hearts would 	act unfailingly on 	the Punjab 	and help the good work 	that was being done 	by the 	ministers of 	the two Dominions.  He 	then came to the Award of the Umpire in the Boundary Commission. The      
 Umpire was chosen by all the parties to the dispute.  It would be unjust and unworthy to impute motives to the Umpire. He was specially invited by the parties to the thankless task. The parties and the public they represented, were loyally to abide by the Award. No Award that he knew—and he had to do with many arbitrations— completely satisfied the parties. But having made the choice they were bound to carry out the terms of the Award. No doubt the best way was for the parties to adjust differences themeselves. This royal road was open to them any time as Khwaja Saheb Nazimuddin and Dr. Ghosh, the two Premiers, had wisely pointed out.
 He knew that the Muslims of Murshidabad and Malda were as gravely disappointed as the Hindus in Khulna or Gopalganj and the Buddhists in the  Chittagong Hill tracts. The latter had gone to East Bengal. He would say to all these parties that it was not only foolish but unbecoming to quarrel over the Award. It should not matter that on the 15th, the day was celebrated according to the national division. If he had been consulted he would have advised non-celebration because of the state of uncertainty. But having by mistake flown in the respective places the wrong flag, there should be no hesitation whatsoever in replacing the wrong flag by the right one. But as he had already said, there was no flag wrong in their Dominion for the simple reason that there was no quarrel left between the parties. Both the Dominions had sincerely professed mutual friendship and mutual regard. Therefore, he would advise the parties to fly both the flags of both the Dominions or be equally respectful whichever flag was flown for the time being.
 He could not understand the misgivings of the Muslims in that Murshidabad and Malda went to West Bengal, nor could he understand the misgivings of the Hindus  in Khulna and Gopalganj and of the Buddhists in the Chittagong Hill tracts. For, in view of the friendship professed by all the parties, there was not the slightest occasion for entertaining any fear. Surely, there would be no compulsion used against the minorities in either of Bengal. The minorities would enjoy equal rights with the majorities.

   HOW TO SAVE THE COW?  
 There is serious ignorance about the place of the cow in Hinduism and in the economy of Indian life. At the same time that India has become independent of foreign rule, by common consent it has been cut into twain so as to induce the untenable belief that one part is popularly described as Hindu India and the other part as Muslim India. Like all superstitions, this of Hindu and Muslim India will die hard. The fact is that the Indian Union and Pakistan belong
 equally to all who call themselves and are, sons of the soil, irrespective of their creed or colour.
 Nevertheless, a large number of local Hindus have begun to believe in the superstition that the Union belongs to the Hindus and the that, therefore, they should enforce their belief  by  law  even among non-Hindus. Hence an emotional wave is sweeping  the country, in order to secure legislation prohibiting the slaughter of cows within the Union.
 In this state, which I hold, is based on ignorance, claiming to be  a knowing lover and devotee, second to none in India of the cow, I must try in the best manner I can to dispel the ignorance.
 Let us at the outset realize that cow worship in the religious sense is largely confined to Gujarat, Marwar, the United Provinces and Bihar. Marwaris and Gujaratis being enterprising merchants, have succeeded in making the greatest noise without at the same time devoting their business talent to the solution of the very difficult question of conserving the cattle wealth of India.
 It is obviously wrong legally to enforce one’s religious practice on those who do not share that religion.
 In so far as the pure economic necessity of cow protection is concerned, it could be easily secured if the question was considered on that ground alone. In that event all the dry cattle, the cows who give less milk than their keep and the aged and unfit cattle would be slaughtered without a second thought. This soulless economy has no place in India although the inhabitants of this land of paradoxes may be, indeed are, guilty of many soulless acts.
 Then how can the cow be saved without our having to kill her off when she ceases to give the economic quantity of milk or when she becomes otherwise an uneconomic burden? The answer to the question can be summed up as follows:
  By 	the Hindus 	performing their duty towards the 	cow and her progeny. 	If they 	did so, our cattle 	would be the 	pride of 	India and 	the world. 	The contrary 	is the case today.  By 	learning the 	science of 	cattle-breeding. Today 	there is perfect anarchy 	in this work.  By 	replacing the 	present cruel method of 	castration by 	the humane 	method practised in the West. By 	thorough reform of 	the pinjarapoles 	of India 	which are 
 
 today, as a rule, managed ignorantly and without any plan by men who do not know their work.
  When 	these primary things are 	done, it 	will be 	found that 	the Muslims 	will, of their 	own accord, 	recognize the necessity, 	of only 	for the 	sake of their 	Hindu brethren, of not 	slaughtering cattle for 	beef or otherwise. 
 The reader will observe that behind the foregoing requirements lies one thing and that is ahimsa, otherwise known as universal compassion. If that supreme thing is realized, everything else becomes easy. Where there is ahimsa, there is infinite patience, inner calm, discrimination, self-sacrifice and true knowledge. Cow-protection is not an easy thing. Much money is wasted in its name. Nevertheless,  in the absence of ahimsa the Hindus have become destroyers instead of saviours of the cow. It is even more difficult than the removel of foreign rule from India.libtech_386_footnote

 One of the teachers had submitted a statement about her experiences with regard to the method of training itself.
 But Gandhiji did not wish to enter into the actual details of the training course; he was sure this had to be adjusted to the conditions and needs of rural Bengal and the details must naturally be worked out by the teachers from their own experience.
 The question which Gandhiji took up for discussion was asked by one of the trainees: In view of the resistance encountered from the rural people and the numerous disappointments which they had to face, how would Gandhiji advise them to proceed, so that success could be ensured?
 Gandhiji began by saying that he was glad that a very fundamental question had been raised. He had, however, only one answer for it. The education through which India had passed for over a century was essentially designed for a particular purpose. In order to feed the interests of capitalism , the entire economic life of India had been changed, the city had become the centre of gravity and not the village; the village had been dethroned from its position of supremacy and virtually been
 
 converted into a slum, kept as far away from city as practicable. The educational system had been planned to supply the needs of this lop-sided economy. If, now, we wanted to create a new India our outlook must be changed altogether. Democracy has to be built up inch by inch in economic, social and political life. Considering the magnitude of the task, it would naturally require a very stout heart to grapple with the problem.
 To the trainees, his advice was one. They must be brave, intelligent and persevering. The villagers might not readily respond. They might  even  prove  hostile. Many interests would have to be disturbed before the ne- cessary change could be effected. But non-violent workers should choose the line of least resistance. They should suffer in their own persons before they could aspire to gain the co- operation of the inert or hostile villagers.  Day  in and day out, they must persevere  at their chosen task, whether it was village sanitation or the imparting of education to a few children, whomperhaps nobody else would care to touch. They might not have the resources to supply their own bread. But even then, through hunger, they must persist without retirement, without bitterness. Then only would their conduct strike the imgination of the villagers; and this element of surprise would open the way to their hearts. Once the inert mass had begun to yield, work would make rapid progress.
 Another trainee then said that there were no signs of response from the villagers even after a year of patient work. Gandhiji comforted her by saying that one year’s work was not enough. We had to sweep aside the accumulated debris of centuries of subjugation. Even a lifetime might not prove enough.libtech_393_footnoteIf our education had been otherwise, we might not have perhaps yielded so readily to despondence. We had to steel our hearts and look towards the bright future to enable us to get out of  the Slough of Despond. So long as we persevered, the struggle itself was victory. It was only courage of this kind which could lead India to the New Age.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_394_footnote        CALCUTTA, 
  August 22, 1947 Gandhiji drew 	attention to 	the fact 	that while some men in the audience responded and kept time, the women hardly responded.  He said that those who had  some 	experience knew the power 	that the  Ramdhun, 	  meaning recital of 	God’s name  from 	the heart, meant. He knew the power that lakhs of soldiers marching 	in step to the tune of their band meant. The desolation that 	military prowess had wrought in the world, he who ran could see. 	Though the War said to have ended, the aftermath was worse than 	actual warfare. Such was the bankruptcy of military power.  Without 	the slightest 	hesitation he 	was there 	to contend 	that the 	power exerted by the Ramdhun 	recited by 	millions of 	mankind with 	true beat of time, 	was different 	in kind 	from and infinitely 	superior to the 	display of 	mili- tary strength. 	And this 	recital of 	God’s name from the 	heart, would produce 	lasting peace and 	happiness in 	the place 	of the 	present desolation they 	wit- nessed.  That 	brought him 	 to what 	was going on in the 	Punjab. If 	there was lasting 	peace in 	Calcutta, it 	must have 	its effect on 	the Punjab. 	But it 	was not so 	as yet. He 	felt sorrow 	and shame 	to learn 	that the Hindus 	were leaving Lahore and 	the Muslims were leaving 	Amritsar. It was 	deplorable that 	the Muslims should 	distruct the former. 	He hoped 	that the Muslims and the Hindus and the Sikh leaders would stop the reported exodus.  Gandhiji 	referred then to the 	visit he 	had from some Muslims 	from Kharagpur. Though 	now there 	was comparative 	quiet there, there was no 	assurance that it 	would last. They 	complained that 	the Hindu officer was 	partial. He 	hoped this 	was not so. He must 	warn all the officers 	and their 	men in 	the police 	force that in their 	work they were 	neither Muslims nor Hindus nor Sikhs. They were Indians bound by 	oath to give full 	protection to 	the afficted 	without regard to their 	religion. Thereby they 	did not cease 	to be Muslims, 	Hindus or Sikhs, 	but became better.  Religion 	was a 	personal matter and 	if we succeeded 	in confining 	it to the 	personal plane, all 	would be well in our political 	life. The 	manifestation of 	brotherhood which was 	being witnessed today 	would prove a passing 	show if we did 	not consolidate it 	by suitable acts 	in the 	social and 	political spheres. If 	officers of 	the Government 	as well 	as members 	of the 	public undertook the 	responsibility and 	worked wholeheartedly for 	the creation of 	a secular State, we 	could build a 	new India that 	would be the glory of the world.

   A NOTElibtech_395_footnote  
 The average quantity of milk that the cow in India yields is said to be roughly 2 lb. per day , that of New Zealand 14 lb., of England 15 lb., of Holland 20 lb. The index figure for health goes up in proportion to the increase in the yield of milk.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_396_footnote       CALCUTTA, 
  August 	23, 1947 Gandhiji 	first referred to the cry of Allah-o-Akbar 	to which some Hindus 	had objected. 	He held that it was probably a cry than which a greater one had not 	been  produced 	by the 	world. It 	was a 	soul-stirring religious 	cry which meant, 	God only 	was great. 	 There was nobility 	in the meaning. Did it become 	objection- able because it was 	Arabic? He 	admitted that 	it had 	in India 	a questionable 	association. It often 	terrified the Hindus because sometimes the Muslims in anger come out 	of the mosques with that 	cry on 	their lips to 	belabour the 	Hindus. He 	confessed that the 	original had 	no such association. 	So far 	as he knew, 	the cry had no 	such association 	in other 	parts of 	the world. 	If, therefore, 	there was to 	be a lasting 	friendship between the 	two, the Hindus 	should have no hesitation 	in uttering 	the cry together 	with their 	Muslim friends. God 	was known by many 	names and had many attributes. 	Rama, Rahim, 	Krishna, Karim, were all 	names of the 	one God. Sat Shri 	Akal, was 	an equally 	potent cry. Should 	a single 	Muslim or Hindu 	hesitate to 	utter it? It 	meant that God was and nothing else was. The Ramdhun had the same virtue.  He 	then came to Vande 	Mataram. That was no 	religious cry. 	It was 	a purely 	political cry. The 	Congress had to examine it.  A reference was made to Gurudev about  	it. And both the Hindu and the Muslim members of the Congress 	Working Committee had to 	come to 	the conclusion 	that its 	opening lines were free 	from any possible 	objection, and 	he pleaded 	that it 	shoud be 	sung together 	by all 	on due 	occasion. It 	should never be 	a chant to 	insult or 	offend the 	Muslims. It 	was to be remembered that 	  it was the cry that had fired political Bengal. Many Bengalis had given up their lives     
 for political freedom with that cry on their lips. Though, therefore, he felt strongly about Vande Mataram as an ode to Mother India, he advised his League friends to refer the matter to the League High Command. He would be surprised if, in view of the growing friendliness between the Hindus and the Muslims, the league High Command objected to the prescribed lines of theVande Mataram, the national song and the national cry of Bengal which sustained her when the rest of India was almost asleep and which was, so far as he was aware, acclaimed by both the Hindus and the Muslims  of Bengal. No doubt, every act, as he pointed out the previous evening, must
 be purely voluntary on the part of either partner. Nothing could be imposed in true friendship.
 The third thing he referred to was about his friend Shaheed Suhrawardy. He was receiving verbal complaints and complaints by letters that Shaheed Saheb was not to be trusted and that the Hindus had suffered a lot during the tenure of his ministry. The complaint was not new. He knew it before they embarked on the join mission which seemed to be bearing unexpectedly good fruit. It was due to the givers of the warning that he should deal with it. He had not had the time even to discuss the matter with his friend. He was in no hurry. His was a trusting nature. He had never lost anything by trusting in good faith. Just as he would expect others to believe his word, unless he was proved untrue, he would likewise believe the word of another. That, he  held, was the only honourable way of living among men. He held that man never lost by trusting and that the deceiver ever lost. He would have to answer for his crime before his Maker. He could say that during the few days they were together, he had found no occasion to regret the friendship. This he could tell them, that without his  association in the work, he (the speaker) would have able to do nothing.
 He referred next to a deputationlibtech_397_footnotehe had from the Punjabi friends, who had drawn a terrible picture of what was said to be going on in the Punjab and who on the strength of the information asked him immediately to proceed to the Punjab. They had informed him that before the killing and arson in the Punjab, what had happened in Bengal was nothing. They added that Lahore was almost denuded of the Hindus and Sikhs as was Amritsar of the Muslims. He hoped that the information was highly coloured. The Punjabis of Calcutta could not know the true situation in the Punjab. Be that as it may, he was sure that if the Hindus, the Sikhs and the Muslims of Calcutta were sincere in their profession of friendship, they all would write to their follows in the Punjab and ask them to desist from mutual slaughter.  The declarations of the Dominion Premiers could not go in vain. He could not believe that the Punjab leaders would not like any non-Muslims in the Pakistan part and non-Hindus and non-Sikhs in the other part. The logical consequence would be that there would be no
 
 gurudwaras and mandirs in the West Punjab and no mosques in the East Punjab. The picture was too gruesome to be ever true.
 Lastly, he came to the nationalist Muslims who were good enough to see him. They twitted him for giving importance and life to the Muslim League and neglecting the nationalist Muslims. He could not plead guilty to either charge. The League had gained importance without his or the Congress aid. It became great because, rightly or wrongly, it caught Muslimfancy. The Congress and he had to deal with and recognize the fact that faced them. He was not sorry for having visited Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah eighteen times in Bombay. His friends should also know that he alone could have done nothing without Shaheed Saheb and Osman Saheb and the other League members. There was no question of neglect of the nationalist Muslims. Nationalism  of a  man was its own merit.  It demanded no recognition.  He would advise his friends  to remain what they were and exhibit in their every act courage, self-sacrifice and true knowledge born of study and he was certain that whether they were few or many they would make their mark on India’s future. He would even advise them to join the League and oppose it from within, whenever they found it to be reactionary. Whilst he said all this, he would advise his League friends to approach the nationalist Muslims in a friendly spirit,whether they remained out or came in. True friendship did not admit of exclusion without the soundest reason.

   IS “HARIJAN” WANTED?libtech_398_footnote  
 CALCUTTA,
 August 24, 1947
 It occurs to me that now that freedom from British rule has come, the Harijan papers are no longer wanted. My views remain as they are. In the scheme of reconstruction for Free India, its villages should no longer depend, as they are now doing, on its cities, but cities should exist only for and in the interest of the villages. Therefore, the spinning-wheel should occupy the proud position of the centre round which all the life-giving village industries would revolve. But this  seems to be receding into the background. The same thing can be said of many other things of which I used to draw a tempting picture. I can no longer dare to do so. My life has become, if possible, more tempestuous than before. Nor can I at present clam any place as a permanent habitation. The columns are predominantly filled by  my
 
 
 after-prayer speeches. In the original I contribute, on an average, only one and a half columns per week. This is hardly satisfiactory. I would like, therefore, the readers of the Harijan weeklies to give me their frank opinion as to whether they really need their Harijan weekly to satisfy their political or spiritual hunger. They should send their answers to the Editor of the Harijan, Ahmedabad, in any of the languages in which they get their weekly, telling me very briefly at the same time, why, if they need it In the left hand upper corner of the envelope containing the answer, the writer should state: “About Harijan”.

 August 24, 1947
 Punjabis in Calcutta have been pressing me to go to the Punjab at once. They tell me a terrible story. Thousands have been killed. A few thousands girls have been kidnapped! Hindus cannot live in the Pakistan area, nor Muslims in the other portion. Add to this the information that the two wings of the army took sides and worked havoc! Can any of this be true?
 When do you think I should go to the Punjab if at all? I have still work in Calcutta, then in Noakhali and Bihar. But everything can be laid aside to go to the Punjab if it is proved to be necessary.libtech_399_footnote

  	I have your letter. I was glad that you wrote frankly. All I said 	was that I would not object if you decided to go to Jugatram. Your    
 duty is to live in the Ashram and overcome all your ignorance. The Ashram, such as it is, is your refuge, Your good lies in doing as I advise, since you have faith in me and have made yourself my daughter. The final responsi-bility should rest with me. You should welcome anything that Chimanlal or Balvantsinha may say. But if you do not like it, you can refer it to me.
 Bhansali  is	a respected elder. But in my estimate he is unworldly, an avadhuta.  He cannot be an example for you to follow.  It would do you no good to let you accompany me on my tours.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING      CALCUTTA, 
  August 	24, 1947 In 	thanking the Corporation for the address, Gandhiji said he could not 	help recalling 	the late Dr. P. C. Ray under whose roof he had lived for one month 	in 1901.  When 	he was with the late Deshbandhu, he used to see him with a few 	friends engaged  in 	lively but 	strictly scientific 	conversation under the 	shadow of 	the Orchelony Monument 	near which they had met. 	That was their 	recreation. Gandhiji asked Dr. 	Ray whether they had any 	drinks or eatables. Dr. Ray emphatically said, “No.” Their food and drink consisted of their instructive as distinct from idle conversation.  Referring 	to the 	address, Gandhiji said 	that this was third 	time he was 	receiv- ing an 	address from 	the the Corporation. 	The first 	was given 	to him by the 	Deshbandhu when he was 	the Mayor.libtech_400_footnoteHe 	recalled the 	fact that the caskets 	were then 	auctioned in 	the interest 	of the 	Harijans. He 	hoped that this casket 	too would 	be sold 	 in the 	same interest by 	the Mayor.  He 	would repeat what he had said in answer to the first address that he 	could not be satisfied 	till Calcutta had become 	the premier 	city in the 	world for 	sanitation. He 	included in 	this the 	sanitation of 	the streets in 	Calcutta which was 	absent today. The 	citizens should have 	healthy minds in 	healthy bodies. That 	they would have 	no goondas, 	no vagabonds, 	no drunkards. 	If the mortality 	in Calcutta 	was to be reduced, 	Calcutta should be 	flowing with clean milk. 	Today it was a most 	difficult commodity to procure. 	Then he 	would expect the 	corporators, by 	honest application, to 	put the 	friendship between the Hindus and the Muslims on a permanent footing in the manner    
 Shaheed Saheb had pointed out.
 Gandhiji said that he had a message from Khwaja Saheb Nazimud- dinlibtech_401_footnotethat he (Gandhiji) should help in procuring at least 500 tons of rice
 out of the shipment that was coming from Burma. The need was so urgent that the ship with the rice should be diverted to Chittagong to deliver the 500 tons. He gladly assciated himself with the request and he hoped that Dr. Rajendra Prasad would, if it was at all possible, allow 500 tons of the precious cargo to be delivered at the Chittagong port.
 In this connection he could not help mentioning the complaint that petty officials in charge of flood relief confined the distribution to Muslim sufferers only. He hoped the news was not true. If unfortunately it was, he had no doubt that the ministers and high-rank officials would redress the wrong. If the two Dominions were to live creditably and as friends, the communal spirit would be wholly purged. It was up to the Hindu and Muslim leaders to see that the seeds of poison that were sown, while they were fighting, would be removed forthwith. Then he said he deplored the fact that the Muslims in Government services when the choice was offered to them, preferred Pakistan and the Hindus, the Indian Union. The choice was made, he did not doubt, in haste. He would be sorry to find that the communal virus had entered the services. He advised that the two Premiers should confer with each other and if it was  at all honestly possible, the services should be given the opportunity to reconsider their choice.  It would be a sorry things for India if Hindu officials could not be trusted  by Muslims and vice versa. Much would depend upon the leaders who influenced the services and the public.
 Lastly, he had heard that Khulna was to celebrate its entry into Pakistan. He deplored such celebration after the Award. But he was consoled by Shaheed Saheb that celebration would be joint and that the Hindus were associating with it. Nevertheless, he could not regard the example with happiness. The jubilant parties ought to restrain themselves, as the aggrieved ones should accept the Award with perfect resignation. It must be regarded as final except to the extent that the ministers of the two Dominions agreed to vary it for the mutual satisfaction of the parties concerned. There was no other worthy or gentlemanly way.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_405_footnote        CALCUTTA, 
  August 	25, 1947  	I am sorry that today being my silence day I cannot speak to you. I 	have, therefore, to write out what I wish to say to you. I have been 	speaking every day about the vital duty of the Hindus in Western 	Bengal, who are the majority community, towards their Muslim 	brethren This duty they will perform truly, if they are able to 	forget the past. We know how all over the world enemies have become 	fast friends. The example of the Britons and the Boers who fought 	one anotherstrenuously, becoming friends we all know. There is much 	greater reason why the Hindus and the Muslims should  become 	friends. We cannot do that if we are not great enough to shed all 	malice.  	This evening I wish to devote to Sylhet. I have received frantic 	telegrams from Sylhet about the serious riots that have broken out 	there. The cause is not known. I am sorry that I am unable to go 	just now to Sylhet, nor am I vain enough to think that my presence 	would immediately abate the mob fury. I know, too, that one should 	not without peremptory cause abandon his present duty, however 	humble it may be, in favour of one which may appear to be higher. To 	adopt the Salvation Army language, we are all soldiers of God to 	fight the battle of right against wrong, by means which are strictly 	non-violent and truthful. As His soldiers ours is “not to reason 	why”, ours is “but to do and die”. Though, therefore, I am 	unable to respond to the urgent call of the sufferers of Sylhet, I 	can appeal, not in vain, to the authorities in East Bengal in 	general and Sylhet in particular to put forth their best effort on 	behalf of the sufferers and deal sternly with the recal-citrants. 	Now that there is peace between the Hindus and the Muslims, I am 	sure the authorities do not relish these ugly outbreaks. It would be 	wrong and misleading to underestimate the  trouble  by calling it 	the work of goondas. The minorities must be made to realize    
 that they are as much valued citizens of the State they live in, as the majority. Let the Premiers of the two divisions of Bengal meet often enough and jointly devise means to preserve peace in the two States and to find enough healthy food and clothing for the inhabitants and enough work for the masses in East and West Bengal. When  the masses, Hindu and Muslim, see their chiefs acting together and working together honestly, courageously and without intermission, the masses living in the two States will take the cue from the leaders and act accordingly. To the sufferers I would advise bravely to face the future and never to give way to panic. Such disturbances do happen in the lifetime of a people. Manliness demands there should be no weakness shown in facing them. Weakness aggravates the mischief, courage abates it.
 Gandhiji first apologized to the vast audience for having to stand or sit on the wet and muddy ground. He then referred to the insult that was done to Shaheed Saheb at a meeting held in honour of Major General Shah Nawaz in Howrah. The General had gently rebuked the men who were guilty of discourtesy.
 Gandhiji said that the past must be forgotton and whilst they were both acting together for a common cause without mental reservations, the insult done to one was done to the other also. And as they together tried to represent Hindu-Muslim unity, the insult done to a Hindu or a Muslim, was an insullt done to the two partners.
 He then referred to the visit of Punjabi friends who pressed him to visit the Punjab as early as passible. He assured them that he was in constant correspondence with Panditji. After all, the Punjab was as much his as any other part of India, for he claimed to be the servant of the whole of India. Moreover, he had passed six months  in that Province during the Martial Law days. He would hasten to the Punjab as early as necessary. Indeed, he was wanted in Sylhet, Malda, Murshidabad and other places. It was not given to any one man to cover all calls upon his time nor was it healthy to depend upon man’s assistance in times of trouble. It was manly and dignified to rely upon God for the dissolution of all troubles. He was the only infallible Help, Guide and Friend.
 He then pointed out that rehabilitation was not going on smoothly. The landlords seemed also to be in the way. They were in duty bound to invite and receive evacuees with open arms. He expected them not to charge or expect rents for months or days enforced absence.
 The last thing he referred to was a letter from a Muslim who described himself as a sufi. He had sent this communication through Shaheed Saheb.
 The purport was that in his opinion there was nothing common between Hinduism and Islam and that the two could not be as if they were one. For, he argued that the Hindus did not believe in the one and only God but held cows and goats as superior to man and believed in high and low, whereas Islam was a brotherhood in
 which there was no hierarchy and which believed in one God as Allah. In this there was a carica- ture of Hinduism. There was no Hindu who put animals, the cow and the goat, before man. But he submitted that if anyone like him believed himself to be the lowest in God’s creation, there was nothing wrong. It was a sign of true humility. He held that every Hindu believed in the one and only God. He admitted that excrescences had grown round Hinduism and that its votaries had not always been true to Hinduism undefiled. It was, therefore, up to an impartial man to understand Hinduism as its votaries like him understood it, just as it was the duty of an impartial Hindu to understand Islam as a good Muslim understood it. That, he held, was the safest rule of interpretation for any faith. Then it would be found that all great religions sprang from the same source and the fundamentals were common to them all.

Now for your reply to the League memorial, I find it weak at several 	places. Of course I have not been able to go deep into the matter. 	Probably such a lengthy reply was not even required. On page 9 you 	have stated about Rajbir that Hindus had committed no great    
 crime. Some youths had done something and the Hindus extinguished the fire. Then why the collective fine of Rs. 5,000? Similarly in the fourth column you say there was insufficient evidence. But a fine was imposed. There are similar inconsistencies at some other places too. Perhaps there is no occasion for such a lengthy reply now. For whom has the memorial been drafted?
 I shall be able to answer your query about non-violence only after looking up the book. I shall try to obtain the book.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_416_footnote       CALCUTTA, 
  August 	26, 1947 There 	was a huge crowd at the meeting and the audience was talking among themselves, creating a 	noise which, Gandhiji said, disabled him from speaking as he  wanted 	to.   As, however, a large part of the audience was patient, he said 	he would say   a 	few words. 	He referred 	first to 	the fact that 	rehabilitation was 	not proceeding as 	rapidly as could be 	wished. If the process was not completed in time and the evacuees  	did not return to 	their places, the 	peace, in 	spite of 	the very large meetings 	every day, would prove 	transitory. He drew 	pointed attention to the 	fact that the 	Lake Area was 	inhabited by rich 	men. If they 	made up their 	minds to do their 	duty, it was 	possible for 	them to 	make their contribution 	to the 	rehabilitation scheme. If 	the police 	but did their duty without fear or favour , he said, half the work would be done.  He 	next referred 	to the 	visit he 	had from Anglo-Indian 	sisters and brothers. 	While he 	was not able to 	address them at 	a meeting, he 	would gladly mention them 	at one 	of his 	prayer meetings. 	During the foreign 	regime, they 	were a favoured 	community. He 	could not hold out any 	hope that the favoured 	treatment would be 	continued during 	independence. But they 	are entitled 	to  the 	 full  justice  that  was 	 the right of every 	citizen. The Anglo-  Indians 	were as much citizens as any other group in India. It was the duty 	of both the Hindus and the Muslims to regard them as fully their 	equals and as brothers and sisters.  He 	then referred to the provincial spirit that seemed to be infecting 	the pro- vinces. Thus he saw in the papers that some Assamese 	thought that Assam belonged exclusively to the Assamese. If that 	spirit fired every province, to whom could India belong? He held 	that the people of all the provinces belonged to India and India 	belonged to all. They only condition was that no one could go and 	settle in another    
 province to exploit it or rule it or to injure its interest in any way.  All were servants  of India and they lived only in the spirit of service. The same provincial spirit was reported from Bihar against the Bengalis. The extreme instance reported was from Darjeeling. It was said that there was a Gurkha League whose business it was to resent the entry into Darjeeling of the plainsmen. They were reported to be resorting to force for the prosecution of their purpose. He hoped that the poison was confined to a very few young men who lacked imagination and love for India. He had the pleasure  of meeting distinguished Gurkha officials who took pride in considering themselves part of India. He had provided the golden rule of conduct. No one could dare migrate to any province to its injury and no force should be used to attain one’s end.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_420_footnote        CALCUTTA, 
  August 	27, 1947  Gandhiji 	said that the present 	was his second 	visit to Motiaburz. 	The first 	was when 	Maulana Saheb Abul Kalam Azad and 	he visited 	them years ago because 	there was 	a fight between Hindus 	and Muslim 	workmen. Fortunately when they reached the 	scene of 	trouble, it 	was almost over but 	they got 	undeserved credit. The 	present was 	a happy occasion. The 	Hindus and 	the Muslims had 	adjusted their 	differences and had 	become friends. He 	hoped that 	this was a lasting 	friendship. He wanted 	to say 	a few 	words to 	the workmen 	in the 	working men’s locality. 	He hoped 	that there was no 	distinction between the 	Hindus and 	the Muslims in 	labour. They were all 	labourers. If 	the communal canker 	entered the labour ranks, 	both would 	weaken labour  and therefore, 	themselves and the 	country. Labour was 	a great 	leveller of all 	distinctions. If 	they realized that truth, 	he would 	like them to go a step 	further. Labour, because it 	chose to 	remain unintelligent, 	either became subservient 	or insolently 	believed in damaging 	capitalists’s goods and 	machinary or 	even in 	killing capitalists. He 	was a 	lobourer by 	conviction and 	a Bhangi. 	As such 	his interests 	were bound with those of 	labour and he wished to 	tell them that violence would never save them. They would be killing 	the goose that laid 	golden eggs. 	What he had 	been saying for 	years was that labour was 	far superior to 	capital. Without 	labour gold, silver and 	copper were a 	useless burden. It 	was labour 	which extracted precious 	ore from 	the bowels 	of the 	earth. He 	could quite conceive of 	labour existing without 	metal. Labour was 	priceless, not 	gold. He wanted marriage between capital and labour. They could work 	wonders in co-operation. 	But that could 	happen only when labour 	was intelligent 	enough to co- 	operate with itself 	and then offer 	co-operation with 	capital on 	terms of 	honourable equality. 	Capital controlled labour because it 	knew the art of 	combination. Drops in 	separation could only 	fade away; drops in 	co-operation made the 	ocean which carried 	on its broad 	bosom ocean greyhounds. 	Similarly, if all 	the labourers in 	any part 	of the world combined 	together, they 	could not 	be tempted by higher 	 wages  or helplessly 	allow themselves 	to be attracted 	for a 	pittance. A 	true and 	non-violent combination 	of labour 	would act like a 	magnet attracting to 	it all the needed 	capital. Capitalists 	would then exist only as 	trustees. When 	that happy day dawned, 	there would 	be no difference 	between capital and 	labour. The 	labour will have ample 	food, good 	and sanitary 	dwellings, all the 	necessary education for 	their children, 	ample leisure 	for self-education and proper medical assistance.  Then 	he came to the nationalist Muslims who had sent him the following    
 note:
 You have expressed the opinion that the nationalist Muslims should join the
 League. Then does it imply that the Congress has now become a communal organization.
 Gandhiji said that he was not guilty of asking them to discard nationalism or of expecting the Congress to be another Hindu Sabha. He hoped that the Congress would never commit suicide by being communal organization. When the Congress ceased to represent all who were proud to call themselves Indians, whether prince or pauper, Hindus, Muslims or any other, it will have destroyed itself. Therefore, he could not advise a Muslim Congressman to join the League if the condition of joining the League was to discard or suppress his Congress membership. He would vote for those resolutions of the League which were in the nation’s interest and against those which were contrary to the nation’s interest. He had in mind several Muslims of staunch faith who were neither in the Congress nor in the League. He advised the nationalist Muslim friends to join the League if they wanted to affect the Muslim masses. Real nationalists needed no encouragement from him or anyone else. Nationalism, like virtue, was its own reward. His one warning was that they should never think of power or bettering their worldly prospects by joining the one or the other organization. A nationalist would ever think of service, never of power or riches. There could be one President of the Congress or the League. Presidentship came by merit and strength of service. The League had become what it was, not by his or Congress cajolery. The Qaid-e-Azam was an able President, whom neither riches nor titles could buy. He was a front-rank barrister and rich man. Being the son of a merchant he knew how to multiply his earnings as a lawyer by wise investments. This acknowledgement did not mean that Gandhiji liked all his ways or that the latter had led the Muslims in the right way. He had his differences with the Qaid-e-Azam and the League. But he could not withhold merit where it was due. It was, he hoped, clear to the nationalist Muslims under what conditions he advised them to join the League.
 Gandhiji then came to the question addressed to him by some members of the Azad Hind Fauj.libtech_421_footnote

    LETTER TOD. B. KALELKAR      CALCUTTA, 
    CHI. 	KAKA,  August 	28, 1947 
  	I have your letter. I had told Amritlal that so long as the 	substance of my draft resolution was preserved he could make in it 	any changes he liked. And in the last resort the general body of the 	Conference has an unfettered right to alter even the substance. It  	would, of course, be a question whether it could retain me after it 	has altered the substance. But that will be considered if and when 	such an     
 occasion arises.
 I might agree that the teaching of two scripts at the same time can be unscientific, but I regard knowledge of both the scripts indispensable, so much so that I would not give a certificate even for the first course in the national language to a candidate who did not know both the scripts. He would be eligible for the certificate only when he had learnt the second script, too.
 It is not correct to say that because I have not used the phrase “whereas” in the draft resolution, the language of the draft is not legal. The word is used in court documents. And those who draft the resolutions are mostly lawyers, they use the language of court documents and make the resolutions uncouth. After all even a resolution is an appeal.
 The Conference has a right to make changes under pressure of new circumstances. I do not, in this case, wish to yield to such pressure because I think that that will harm the country. Hence my emphaitc advice in the present circumstances is to be cling all  the  more resolutely to the policy to which we have adhered till now.
 To me, ever since I understood the problem, Hindi and Hindustani have been two forms of the same language. And there will be a difference between Urdu and Hindustani as there is between Hindi and Hindustani.
 I would, thus, describe Hindustanias a language midway between Urdu and Hindi, one which would bring about a confluence of the two. Accordingly, if in course of time only one script survives in use, Hindustani will have become and will remain one from of Hindi and Urdu.
 We need not object if the Governments do not make knowledge of the two scripts obligatory but only encourage it. If we keep our house in order and clean it regularly, we shall have done our duty.
 It will be tantamount to harassing the Urdu-speaking people to make the Nagari script compulsory for all. I  would,  therefore, earnestly appeal to all the members of the Conference that  they should not only acquire a good knowledge of both the scripts, but also boldly advocate such a policy in public. Only then shall we be able to influence the various State Governments.

  August 	28, 1947  Gandhiji 	addressed after prayer 	the students 	of Calcutta. 	He said 	that he had 	done teaching 	in his 	own way from his 	early youth and 	probably the 	very first 	meeting he 	addressed after his 	return to 	India in 	1915 was 	that of 	students. Since then 	he had 	addressed numerous 	student-meetings throughout his many 	wanderings in India. He 	was not new to them nor 	were they new 	to him. But 	of late he 	had ceased to 	address meetings as he 	used to 	do before. He 	was, therefore, glad that 	he was 	able to 	address the 	students. Their 	Vice-Chancellor was 	good enough to 	see him about the 	evening’s proceedings. 	He was nervous 	about the students’ 	behaviour  towards 	 Shaheed Saheb. He 	said that he 	would have only the 	prayer and 	his usual after-prayer 	speech. It 	should not 	have been so. Everywhere 	there appeared 	to be anarchy 	in the 	student world. They did not 	tender obedience to their 	teachers and their 	Vice- Chancellor. 	On the 	contrary. they 	expected obedience from 	their teachers. It 	was a 	painful exhibition on 	the part of 	those who 	were to 	be the future leaders of 	the nation. They 	gave an exhibition 	of unruliness 	that evening. 	He was 	forced with 	placards in 	the foreign tongue depicting his comrade Shaheed Saheb in unbecoming language. He     
 suggested to them that inasmuch as they had insulted Shaheed Saheb, they had insulted the speaker. Shaheed Saheb could not be insulted by the language used against him. But the speaker could not take up that attitude. The students should be, above all, humble and correct. They had an object lesson in their Vice-Chancellor. The Chief Minister, Shaheed Saheb and he sat on the platform provided for them but the Vice-Chancellor sat among the rest of the visitors. His humility reminded him of Krishna who, when Raja Yudhishthira performed his yajna, chose the menial work of washing the feet of the guests. Thereby he showed his innate nobility. The greatest to remain great had to be the lowliest by choice. If he could speak from his knowledge of Hindu belief, the life of a student was to correspond to the life of a sannyasi up to the time his studies ended. He was to be under the strictest discipline. He could not marry nor indulge in dissipation. He could not indulge in drinks and the like. His behaviour was to be a pattern of exemplary self-restraint. Had they lived at all up to the pattern, they would not have done what they did at the prayer meeting.libtech_426_footnote
 The evening before he had a notelibtech_427_footnotefrom some members of the Azad Hind Fauj as to his opinion about them. He said that he had come in close contact with some of the officers of the Fauj. In referring to the Fauj he felt constrained to refer to Nataji who, he was of opinion, was dead in the body but lived in the servants of India. He had the pleasure of coming in touch with Subhas Babu when the latter had just returned from England with the determination to sacrifice a lucrative career that was open to him. He perferred selfless service to selfish ambition and placed himself under the Deshbandhu. Therefore he was able to come in close touch with the speaker. Though Subhas Babu became a non-violent non-co-operator, he never saw eye to eye with the speaker in his unadulterated non-violence. His was a life full of perilous adventure and romance. His daring was unequalled. He scraped together an army composed of Indians drawn from all provinces, belonging to all religions and by his glorious example he had infused into them the spirit of willing discipline and obedience. It was not a small thing for his handful of army which his genius had scraped together to offer battle to the mightiest empire of modern times. Gandhiji was told by the officers of the Azad Hind Fauj that Subhas Babu had advised the members of the Army to carry out what he (Gandhiji) might suggest; for the struggle in India was of his (Gandhiji’s) conception as the struggle outside India was of Netaji’s. His answer to the question asked was that the members of the Azad Hind Fauj were not to expect to be absorbed in the current military ranks nor to be a separate unit of the army in any of the two parts of India. He held it to be impracticable at least for some time to come. The best thing for them was
 
 to work as a separate compact body of servants of India. It would be best for them to hold together on a plot of land, to turn their swords into ploughshares and grow more food for the hungry millions. If they did not like the suggestion, they should be absorbed into the civil life and serve the country. ‘Once a soldier always a soldier’, would be a dangerous doctrine in free India. He had lived in South Africa for 20 years where every Boer was a first-class soldier when soldiering was necessary, otherwise he was a wonderful farmer. Such was General Bothalibtech_428_footnote. Such is Field Marshal Smutslibtech_429_footnote. He is a great lawyer, a great farmer, owning a magnificent farm and everyone knew him to be a distinguished soldier. What was Netaji himself? Was he less than Field Marshal Smuts? Soldiering was never his profession. Today when India was shaking with communalism and fratricidal disturbances, let the members of the Fauj set a noble example of what they were under Netaji, who evoked such affection from his men that he (the speaker) had known his officers being unable to think of him without tears. Let them translate that affection into action.
 That in spite of all his affection and respect for Netaji, they had differences of opinion was a matter of no consequence. Such divergence would exist between the best of friends. Let the students too, whether, they believed in violence or non- violence, understand that strictest discipline was common to both.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_451_footnote      CALCUTTA, 
  August 	29, 1947  Gandhiji, 	therefore, commenced his 	speech by 	congratulating Shaheed 	Saheb and 	the other Muslims on 	standing. He 	purposely kept 	seated because he 	had learnt that 	their culture did not 	require standing as 	a mark of 	respect when any 	national song 	or bhajan 	was sung. It 	was an 	unnecessary importation 	from the West. A 	respectful posture 	on such 	occasions was the correct 	attitude. After all, it 	was the mental attitude 	that mattered, not the 	superficial appearance. 	He then 	suggested that there should be 	one universal 	notation for Vande 	Mataram, if 	it was to 	stir millions; 	it must 	be sung 	by millions 	in one 	tune and 	one mode. After all, 	national songs could only be 	two or 	three. But they should 	all have their 	common notation. It was 	up to the 	Santiniketan authorities or some such authoritative society to produce an acceptable notation.  Gandhiji 	then referred to the Christians. He had had the pleasure of 	receiving them the day before. They said that the major communities 	had taken care of themselves but what was to happen to the Christian 	Indians? Were they to have no      was 	sung everyone including Suhrawardy and other Muslims had stood up. 
 seats in the Governments or the legislatures? He told the friends that the poisonous favouritism of the foreign rule was dead and gone. Merit should now be the sole test. In a well-ordered society there should be no minority. Why should they not feel that they were of the forty crores, but not a mere handful in the forty crores? Whatever their religion, all born in India and proud of their birth were equal in the eye of the law. On the strength of merit, i.e., intellectual capacity, self-sacrifice, courage and incorruptibility, a Christian could be the Chief Minister without exhibiting greater merit than a Hindu or Muslim. Religion was a purely personal matter. He expected that what was true of the Union was equally true of Pakistan. He asked his Christian brethren also not to take their Christianity as it was interpreted in the West. They knew that there they fought with one another as never before. After all Jesus was an Asiatic depicted as wearing the Arabian flowing robe. He was the essence  of meekness. Gandhiji hoped that the Christians of India would express in their lives, Jesus, the crucified of the Bible, and not as interpreted in the West with its blood- stained fingers. He had no desire to criticize the West. He knew and valued the many virtues of the West. But he was bound to point out that Jesus of Asia was misrepresented in the West except in individuals.
 Then he answered the question whether the minorities would have recognition as religious minorities had; thus, whether Bengalis of Bihar, though a minority, would have recognition. This was a ticklish question. In his opinion an Indian was a citizen of India enjoying equal rights in every part of India. Therefore, a Bengali had every right in Bihar as a Bihari. But he wished to emphasize that a Bengali must merge in the Bihari. He must never be guilty of exploiting Biharis or feeling a stranger or behaving as a stranger in Bihar. If the speaker brought his Gujarat manners to Bengal and imposed himself on the province, he would expect the Bengalis to expel him. He could not then claim the rights of an Indian as against Bengalis. All rights flowed from duties previously and duly performed. One thing he must stress, that in both the Dominions of India, the use of force for the assertion of rights must be eschewed altogether if they were to make any progress. Thus, neither the Bengalis nor the Biharis could assert themselves at the point of the sword, nor could the Boundary Commission Award similarly be changed. It was the first lesson to be learnt in a democratic, independent India. Their independence was yet only a fortnight old. Liberty never meant the licence to do anything at will. Independence meant the voluntary restraint and discipline, voluntary acceptance of the rule of law in the making of which the whole of India had its hand through its elected representatives. The only force at the disposal of democracy was that of public opinion. Satyagraha, civil disobedience and fasts had nothing in common with the use of force, veiled or open. But even these had restricted use in democracy. They could not even think of them whilst the Governments were settling down and the communal distemper was still stalking from one province to another.

   ABOUT STUDENTSlibtech_452_footnote  
A correspondent says :
 You have begun writing in time about the student world of India. Your opinion was highly necessary. The late H. G. Wells has somewhere described the students as “Undergraduate Intelligence”. The exploitation of the half- baked student world is highly dangerous. It tears the students under exploita- tion from the essential work of study and its assimilation. In these critical times the harm done by the exploitation of “Undergraduate Intelli-gence” recoils upon the exploiters. Your writing referred to above gives rise to one question: Was it not Gandhiji who first drew the students to politics? I know that this is not true. But it is necessary for you to reiterate your position.
 The second thing is: What should students’ organizations do? What should be their objective? Today, as you know, students’ organizations are considered as stepping-stones to entrance into political life. Some exploit them for that purpose.
Only during this week I had the misfortune to experience what
 harm “Undergraduate Intelligence” can do. I was invited by the Vice-Chancellor to address a students’ gathering.libtech_453_footnotelibtech_454_footnoteSad to say,   they indulged in a hostile demonstration against Shaheed Saheb. Afterwards they saw reason and they repented. And they gave a demonstration of how half-baked intelligence could do right under wise guidance. This would be apparent from the report of my post- prayer speech in the current issue of the Harijan.
 Let me hope that the rendering into Gujarati in the columns of the Harijanbandhu will be quite in keeping with the original in English. The English rendering is the translation of the speech that was delivered in Hindustani. But it has not been possible to give the properly edited Hindustani and its authorized English translation. Who could shoulder that burden? I have deprived myself of the assistance of Pyarelal and Dr. Sushila Nayyar, who are engaged in better work. Rajkumari’s services have been unavailable for several months. Now she has become a Minister.
 If there is one compact students’ organization, it can become a mighty instrument of service. Their objective can only be one: Never
 
 Harijanbandhu, 7-9-1947.
 for the purpose of finding a lucrative career but fitting themselves for the service of the motherland. If they were to do so, their knowledge would attain a great height. Agitation is only for thsoe who had completed their studies. While studying, the only occupation of  students must be to increase their knowledge. Education, as it is prescribed today, is detrimental, conceived in terms of the masses of India. It is possible to show that the present education has been of some use to the country. I regard it as negligible. Let no one be deceived by it. The acid test of its usefulness is this: Does it make, as it should, an effective contribution to the production of food and clothing? What part does the student world play in stopping  the present senseless slaughter? All education in a country has got to be demonstrably in promotion of the progress of the country in which it is given. Who will deny that education in India has not served that purpose? Hence one purpose of the organization should be  to  discover the defects of the present education and seek to remove them so far as possible in their own selves. By their correct conduct they will be able to convert to their view the heads of education. If they do so, they will never be entangled in party politics. In the revised scheme, constructive and creative programme will naturally have its due place. Indirectly their action will keep the politics of the country free of the spirit of exploitation.
 Now for the first question. What I said in the matter of students’ education at the time of the country’s battle for freedom is evidently forgotten. I did not invite the students to devote themselves to politics whilst they were in schools and colleges. I had suggested non-violent non-co-operation and that they should quit these educational institutions and throw themselves into the battle for freedom. I had encouraged national universities and national schools and colleges. Unfortunately, the snare of the education given in our schools and colleges was too strong for the students. Only a handful were able to disengage themselves from it. Thus it is not proper to say that I drew the students to the politics of the country. Moreover, when, after 20 years of exile in South Africa, I returned to India in 1915, the students, while they were engaged in their studies, had already been drawn to political life. Probably, there was no other way. Our foreign rulers had so devised the whole life of the country that nobody could engage in politics suitable for the deliverance of the country from bondage. The
 foreign rulers had so devised and controlled the education of the country that the youth remained under that control and millions were kept in comparative darkness. This was the way in which foreign control was rendered as permanent as possible. Therefore, apart from the colleges and schools controlled by foreign rulers, patriotic workers were left with no other choice. To what extent this foreign education was misused need not be considered here.

 If I am not going to the Punjab, would I be of much use in Delhi as an adviser or consultant? I fancy I am not built that way. My advice has value only when I am actually working at a particular thing. I can only disturb when I give academic advice as on food, clothing, the use of the military. The more I think, the more I sense the truth of this opinion.

My 	Days with Gandhi, p. 	268   
    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING      CALCUTTA, 
  August 	30, 1947  Gandhiji 	said that this was 	Shaheed Saheb’s 	constituency. He was, 	therefore, glad 	that he was expected 	to visit 	Barasat. He noticed 	the absence 	of the Pakistan 	flag or 	the Muslim 	League flag. Why did not 	the Hindus of 	Barasat go 	out of 	their way 	to invite their Muslim 	brethren to fly 	the Pakistan flag 	side by side 	with the tricolour? That 	never meant that the Muslims 	were to 	impose the 	Pakistan flag 	or the 	League flag on 	the Hindus. 	He would 	apply the same 	rule where the Muslims 	were in a majority. 	If a Hindu 	girl was in 	their midst, they should 	encourage the solitary 	girl to unfurl 	the tricolour 	and recite 	Ramdhun. That 	was the sure 	sign of Hindu-Muslim 	friendship which 	then would be capable 	of bearing 	the severest 	strain upon it. 	No doubt, they learnt the daily tale of family strife in the Punjab. It had become difficult    
 for the Muslims to live in the East and the Hindus and Sikhs in the West. Was there to be a transfer of crores of population? The way to stem the tide of this savagery and inhuman conduct was for the Hinuds and Muslims of the two divisions of Bengal to preserve their equanimity and to demonstrate by their unbreakable friendship the way for all the communities to live. The way of mutual strife and exclusiveness was the way to perdition and slavery. If there was heart friendship, he could not understand the objection of Muslims, wherever they were in a majority, to being included in Western Bengal as in Murshidabad and Malda or for the Hindu majority, to being included in Pakistan. This was a sign not of friendship but of unworthy and mutual distrust.
 He then referred to a letter he had received from the local Gurkha League saying that he was misinformed by his correspondent on the strength of whose letter he had issuedlibtech_467_footnotehis advice to the Gurkhas of Darjeeling. They contended that they claimed to be as much Indians as any. They could have no repugnance towards the Bengalis or the Marwaris who had settled in Darjeeling. But they expected Gandhiji to share their apprehension if they found the Bengalis or the Marwaris to be lording over them. Let them not be proud of their learning or riches and treat the Gurkhas as if they were born   to be bearers of burden. Would he not expect perfect equality among them and expect the Bengalis to lift them up by giving them knowledge of letters and the Marwaris to share with them the secret of conducting honest trade? Gandhiji said that he had no hesitationin endorsing the Gurkha position and hoped that the Bengalis, Marwaris and others who had settled on that beautiful hill, would share with their Gurkha brothers their best and show them that they were their friends and servants, in no sense exploiters.
 He then came to refer to a question which Professor Nirmal Kumar Bose had prepared for him as a result of his discussions with visitors. What did he mean by bread labour and what was its application to the present state? The economics of bread labour was the living way of life. It meant that every man bad to labour with his body for his food and clothing. If Gandhiji could convince the people of the value and necessity of bread labour there never would be any want of bread and cloth. He would have no hesitation in saying to the people with confidence that they must starve and go naked if they would neither work on the land nor spin and weave. They read in the papers that the whole of India was on the brink of starvation and nakedness. If his plan was accepted, they would soon find that India had enough food and enough khadi which the masses would produce for themselves. No doubt they should be assisted in the matter of using the land wisely and should also be supplied with spinning and weaving accessories, and instructors. He added that he had not hesitated even to discuss libtech_468_footnotehis method with Mr. Casey (Governor of Bengal) who was taking keen
 
 interest in the water supply of Bengal. No doubt, Mr. Casey’s was gigantic scheme requiring years and tons of money. His was an efficient but unambitious and inexpensive programme.

   QUESTION BOX  
 QUESTION: You have often stated while you were in Noakhali that failure of your mission there would be the failure of your own ahimsa and not of ahimsa itself. In the light of what has been achieved here (Calcutta), do you think that your ahimsa has succeeded or is on the way to success?
 ANSWER: It is a correct statement that has been attributed to me. Ahimsa is always infallible. When, therefore, it appears to have failed, the failure is due to the inaptitude of the votary. I have never felt that my ahimsa has failed in Noakhali, nor can it be said that it has succeeded. It is on its trial. And when I talk of my ahimsa I do not think of it as limited to myself. It must include all my co-workers in Noakhali. Success or failure would, therefore, be attributable to the aggregate of the activities of my co-workers and myself.
 What I have said about Noakhali applies to Calcutta. It is too early to state that the application of ahimsa to the communal problem in this great city has succeeded beyond doubt. As I have already remarked, it is wrong to contend that the establishment of friendliness between the two communities was a miracle. Circumstances were ready and Shaheed Saheb and I appeared on the scene to take the credit for
 
 what has happened. Anyway, it is premature to predicate anything about the application. The first thing naturally is that we, the two partners, have one mind and are believers in ahimsa. That being assured, I would say that if we know the science and its application, it is bound to succeed.

    ADDRESS TOMUSLIM MERCHANTSlibtech_474_footnote       CALCUTTA, 
  August 31, 1947 In his speech before the moneyed men Gandhiji said that he want to them as a beggar. Somehow or other when he began life after studies he found that he had the  gift of begging from the rich and the poor alike. He hoped that his appeal would not  go 	in vain. There 	were two ways of rebuilding 	and rehabilitation—either 	the Government or 	the rich 	men of 	Calcutta had 	to find 	the money. 	He held 	that if the 	Government found the 	funds, it would carry no merit. But if the moneyed men took up the 	duty, it 	carried double merit. 	They as 	citizens,would have 	of their 	own free will 	discharged their duty and 	it would be a substantial proof of real friendship between the 	communities.  Mahatma 	Gandhi in 	his speech 	congratulated the 	organizers of 	the function 	which was to cement 	Hindu-Muslim unity. He 	asked them to form their 	own committees, 	for raising 	funds, and making 	expenditure for 	rehabilitation work. 	Those who 	were interested and 	those who 	were in a 	position to 	pay should 	sit together 	and devise 	the programme. 	They should not 	merely think of 	rehabilitating these 	poor sufferers 	in the kind of bustees 	that existed today 	and which 	the poor 	had been 	forced to 	choose as 	their abodes. 	But they should 	think more as 	to how these people 	could live 	with comfort. Those who 	had money should not 	think that it 	was for themselves 	alone. As 	a matter of 	fact, they must look upon 	themselves as trustees 	and should 	pay for 	the cause of 	suffering humanity. They 	knew that Dr. P. 	C. Ghosh, their Chief 	Minister, wanted 	a crore 	for rehabilitation 	work. They should apply 	themselves to 	that. If 	Hindus and 	Muslims, rich and 	poor, could work 	together, it was bound 	to have 	effect in East and West 	Punjab and the work that they would do here would be the work for 	the whole country.libtech_475_footnote  The 	spectacular meetings 	were, no 	doubt, necessary, 	but they 	were not all. 	That which 	led to 	permanent friendship was 	contented rehabilitation. 	All parties, 	all groups, 	had to 	do their duty in 	the direction. 	For the purity 	of hearts 	it was 	necessary for 	all to forget 	the past. 	Forgetfulness properly cultivated was 	a great 	gift. It was 	a rich 	gift bestowed upon 	man by 	the Maker. 	The rich 	men would 	not be 	able to 	put their 	hands into their pockets, 	if they 	had not the faculty for 	forgetting the 	past. He asked 	the rich 	men, after Shaheed Saheb and 	he had withdrawn, to 	sit together and 	not to leave the Hotel till they had come to a wise decision.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 
 
CALCUTTA,
 
  August 	31, 1947  After 	prayer Gandhiji said that as he had addressed the meeting of the 	wealthy men, he did not propose to say much to the audience. He was 	glad to be informed by Kamal Babu, their M.L.A., that there was now 	perfect friendship between the two communities and that the evacuees 	were ready to return. The great obstacle was that the factories 	where they were earning their livelihood had not started working. 	The Muslim neighbours had undertaken to renovate the evacuated 	premises. If all the information was cent per cent true, the truth 	will work its way into the whole of the affected parts of Calcutta. 	He informed the audience that he proposed to leave for Noakhali on 	Tuesday. If Shaheed Saheb too could accompany him at the same time, 	he would do so. He did not propose to stay in Noakhali for long and 	hoped to return to Calcutta to finish the work that had begun under 	happy auspices. Meanwhile, he hoped that the work of rehabilitation 	would be continued with double speed. It did not admit of delay if 	there was to be lasting peace.  Harijan, 	21-9-1947      TALK WITH PYARELALlibtech_476_footnote    August 	31, 1947  	My resolve to go to Noakhali has collapsed after this evening’s 	happenings.libtech_477_footnoteI 	cannot go to Noakhali or   for  that  matter  anywhere when Calcutta 	is in flames. Today’s incident to me is a sign and warning from 	God. You have for the time being, therefore, to return to Noakhali 	without me. You can tell the people of Noakhali that if my 	colleagues for any reason cannot be there, they will find me, 	surely, in their midst.  And 	then casually he hinted that if the conflagration spread he would 	have no alternative but to fast. Have 	I not often said that there is yet another fast in store for 
 me?   Harijan, 	14-9-1947, and 	Mahatma Gandhi—The 	Last Phase, Vol. II, 	p. 404 
     
  
   A NOTE  
 [August 1947]libtech_478_footnote
 I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen, and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything by it? Will it restore him to a control over his own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to swaraj for the hungry and spiritually starving millions?
Then you will find your doubts and yourself melting away.

    LETTER TOVALLABHBHAI PATEL      CALCUTTA, 
     CHI. 	VALLABHBHAI,  September 	1, 1947 
  	I got your letter. Bhopal (Nawab’s) letter is strange.libtech_483_footnoteI  did  not like it. Your task is hard indeed. May 	God grant you the necessary strength. If Bhopal plays the game, 	Hyderabad’s problem will be easy to solve. And the same will be 	true of Pakistan.  	I have already sent you my programme, but now even that is as good 	as cancelled. We were to go to Noakhali tomorrow morning. So Shaheed 	Saheb went home. I am the only elderly person in the house. Dinshaw 	Mehta is here, but what can he do? He does not know the language and 	his large body is of no use.  	Someone received knife wounds in Machhva Bazaar. No one knew who 	stabbed him. People brought him here for demonstration. Perhaps they 	wanted to attack Shaheed Suhrawardy, but they could not find him; so 	their anger was turned on me. There was an uproar in the front yard. 	Both the girlslibtech_484_footnotewent 	out among the crowd. I was in bed about to go to sleep. Our Muslim 	landlady came in to have a look as she was afraid I might come to 	harm. I sensed danger and got up. I broke my silence. My vow permits 	me to break it on such occasions. I went to face the crowd but the 	girls would not leave my side. Other people also surrounded me. 	Glass windows were being broken and they started smashing the doors 	also. There was an attempt to cut the wires of the electric ceiling 	fans but only a few were snapped. I started shouting at the crowd, 	asking them to be quiet. But who would listen? I could, moreover, 	speak only Hindustani and they were Bengalis. There were also some 	Muslims nearby. I asked them not to strike back. So they merely 	stood around me. There were two groups; one trying to     
 incite the crowd, the other trying to pacify it. There were two policemen also. They also used no force. With folded hands they addressed [the crowd] in a loud voice and they stopped me. Kalyanam suggested that I should go and sit inside. Bisen was in the centre. He was wearing only pyjamas and was taken for a Muslim. Bricks were thrown. One hit a Muslim. No one was wounded, but the brick could have struck me. The Superintendent of Police came soon after and the youngsters dispersed after causing considerable damage to the house. Prafulla Babulibtech_485_footnotelibtech_486_footnoteand Annadalibtech_487_footnotelibtech_488_footnotearrived. Prafulla suggested the posting of more police guard but I objected. Everyone suspects the Hindu Mahasabha [was behind the attack]. I have asked them to see Syamaprasadlibtech_489_footnotelibtech_490_footnoteand Chatterjilibtech_491_footnotebefore arresting the mischief-makers and not to do anything in a hurry. Such is the position here. I could thus go to bed only at 12.30 a. m. Of course I had to get up at the usual hour.
Please tell Jawaharlal about this when you meet him.

    TALK WITH MARWARI DEPUTATIONlibtech_498_footnote      CALCUTTA, 
  September 	1, 1947  	Go in the midst of the rioters and prevent them from indulging in 	madness or get killed in the attempt. But do not come back alive to 	report failure. The situation calls for sacrifice on the part of 	top- rankers. So far the unknown, nameless rank and file alone have 	been the victims of the holocaust with the one exception of the late 	Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi.libtech_499_footnoteThat is not enough.libtech_500_footnote  Harijan, 	14-9-1947      STATEMENT TOTHE PRESS    September 1, 1947 I regret 	to have to report to you that last night some young men brought to 	the compound a bandaged man. He was reported to have been 	  attacked   by   some   Muslims.  The   Prime   Ministerlibtech_501_footnotelibtech_502_footnotehad 	  him  	examined and the report was that he had no marks on his body of 	stabbing which he was said to have received. The seriousness of the 	injury however is not the chief point. What I want to emphasize is 	that these young men tried to become judges and executioners. This 	was about 10 p.m., Calcutta time. They began to shout at the top of 	their voices. My sleep was disturbed but I tried to lie quiet not 	knowing what was happening. I heard the window-panes being smashed. 	I had lying on either side of me two very brave girls. They would 	not sleep but, without my knowledge, for my eyes were closed, they 	went among the small crowd and tried to pacify them. Thank God the 	crowd did       
 not do any harm to them. The old Muslim lady in the house endearingly called Bi-Amma and a young Muslim stood near my matting, I suppose, to protect me from harm.
 The noise continued to swell. Some had entered the central hall and began to knock open the many doors. I felt that I must get up and face the angry group. I stood at the threshold of one of the doors. Friendly faces surrounded me and would not let me move forward. My vow of silence admitted of my breaking it on such occasions and I broke it and began to appeal to the angry young men to be quiet. I asked the Bengali grand-daughter-in-law to translate my few words into Bengali. All to no purpose. Their ears were closed against reason.
 I clasped my hands in the Hindu fashion. Nothing doing. More window-panes began to crack. The friendly ones in the crowd tried to pacify them. There were two police officers. Be it said to their credit that they did not try to exercise authority. They too clasped their hands in appeal. A lathi blow missed me and everybody round me. A brick aimed at me hurt a Muslim friend standing by. The two girls would not leave me and held on to me to the last. Meantime the Police Superintendent and his officers came in. They too did not use force. They appealed to me to retire. Then there was a chance of their stilling the young men. After a time the crowd melted.
 What happened outside the compound gate I do  not  know except that the police had to use tear gas to disperse the crowd. Meantime Dr. P. C. Ghosh, Annada Babu and Dr. Nripen walked in and after some discussion left. Happily Shaheed Saheb had  gone  home to prepare for tomorrow’s proposed departure for Noakhali. In view of the above ugly incident which no one could tell where it would lead to I could not think of leaving Calcutta for Noakhali.
 What is the lesson of the incident? It is clear to me that if India is to retain her dearly won independence all men and women must completely forget lynch law. What was attempted was an indifferent imitation of lynch law. If the Muslims misbehaved, the complainants could, if they would not go to the ministers, certainly go to me or my friend Shaheed Saheb. The same thing applies to Muslim complai- nants. There is no way of keeping the peace in Calcutta or elsewhere if the elementary rule of civilized society is not observed. Let them not think of the savagery of the Punjab or outside India. The recognition of the golden rule of never taking the law into one’s own hands has no exceptions.
 My secretary Devprakash in Patna wires:  “Public agitated Punjab happenings. Fell statement necessary impressing  duty  of public and the Press.” Shri Devprakash is never unduly  agitated. There must be some unguarded word by the Press. If that is so at this time when (we) are sitting on a powder magazine, the Fourth Estate has to be extra-wise and reticent. Unscrupulousness will act  as  a lighted match. I hope every editor and reporter will realize his duty to the full.
 One thing I must mention. I have an urgent message calling me to the Punjab. I hear all kinds of rumours about recrudescence of trouble in Calcutta. I hope they are exaggerated if not quite baseless. The citizens of Calcutta have to reassure me that there would be nothing wrong in Calcutta and that peace once restored will not be broken.
 From the very first day of peace, that is 14th August last, I have been saying that the peace might only be a temporary lull. There was no miracle. Will the foreboding prove true and will Calcutta again lapse into the law of the jungle? Let us hope not, let us pray to the Almighty that He will touch our hearts and ward off the recurrence of insanity.
 Since the foregoing was written, i. e., about four o’clock during my silence, I have come to know fairly well the details of what has happened in the various parts of the city. Some of the places which were safe till yesterday have suddenly become unsafe. Several deaths have taken place. I saw two dead bodies of very poor Muslims.libtech_503_footnoteI saw also some wretched-looking Muslims being carted away to a place of safety. I quite see that last night’s incident so fully described above pales into insignificance before this flare-up. Nothing that I may do in the way of going about in this open conflagration could possibly arrest it. I have toldlibtech_504_footnotethe friends who saw me in the evening what their duty is. What part am I to play in order to stop the rot? The Sikhs and the Hindus must not forget what East Punjab has done during these few days. Now the Muslims in West Punjab have commenced the mad career. It is said that the Sikhs and the Hindus are enraged over the Punjab happenings.
I have adverted above to an urgent call for me to go to the
 
 Punjab. But now that the Calcutta bubble seems to have burst, with what face can I go to the Punjab? The weapon which has hitherto proved infallible for me, is fasting. To put an appearance before a yelling crowd does not always work. It certainly did not last night. What my word in person cannot do my fast may. It may touch the hearts of all the warring elements even in the Punjab if it does in Calcutta. I therefore begin fasting from 8.15 p.m. to end only if and when sanity returns to Calcutta. I shall as usual permit myself to add salt and soda bicarblibtech_505_footnoteto the water I may wish to drink during the fast.
 If the people of Calcutta wish me to proceed to the Punjab and help the people there they have to enable me to break the fast as early as may be.libtech_506_footnote

   DISCUSSION WITH C. RAJAGOPALACHARIlibtech_507_footnote  
 September 1, 1947
 RAJAJI: You don’t expect me to approve of your proposed step.   Can you  fast against the goondas ?
GANDHIJI: The conflagration has been caused not by the goondas
 but by those who have become goondas. It is we who make goondas. Without our sympathy and passive support, the goondas would have no legs to stand upon. I want to touch the hearts of those who are behind the goondas.
 But must you launch your fast at this stage? why not wait and watch a little?
 It would be too late afterwards. The minority Muslims cannot be left in a perilous state. My fast has to be preventive if
 
 it is to be any good. I know I shall be able to tackle the Punjab too if I can control Calcutta. But if I falter now, the conflagration  may spread and soon, I can see clearly, two or three powers will be upon us and thus will end our short-lived dream of independence.
 But supposing you die, the conflagration would be worse.
At least I won’t be there to witness it. I shall have done my bit.
More is not given a man to do.
 But why add sour lemon juice to water, if you are to put yourself entirely in God’s hands?
You are right. I allowed it out of weakness. It jarred on me even
 as I wrote it. A satyagrahi must hope to survive his conditional fast by a timely fulfilment of the condition.

    LETTER TOVALLABHBHAI PATEL       CALCUTTA, 
  September 	1/2, 1947  CHI. 	VALLABHBHAI,  	Today here they are preparing to fight. I have just returned after 	seeing the dead bodies of two Muslims who had died of wounds. I hear 	that riots have broken out in many places. Thus what was regarded as 	a miracle has proved a short-lived nine-day wonder. Now    
 I am thinking what my duty is in the circumstances. I am writing this at about 6 p. m. As the post will go only tomorrow, I shall be able to add something more. Jawahar wires that I should go to the Punjab.libtech_509_footnoteBut how can I leave Calcutta now? I am thinking within myself and silence helps in that. See the accompanying wire from Mirpur Khas. What could it mean? I have not replied.
 4.45 a. m., September 2, 1947 This much was written last evening. After that I heard much more. A number of people came to see me. I went on thinking of my
own duty. The news I received settled it and I decided to undertake a
 fast. It began at 8.15  last evening. Rajaji called at night. He admonished me a lot, tried hard to persuade me not to go on a fast. But none of his arguments appealed to me. I saw my duty clearly before me. You should not worry, nor should anyone else. Worrying is not going to help. If the leaders are sincere the riots will stop and the fast will be broken. If the riots continue what will I do by merely being alive? What is the use of my living? If I lack even the power to pacify the people, what else is left for me to do? If God wants to make use of me, He will enter the people’s hearts and calm them down and preserve my body. I have started the fast only in His name.
 May God keep all of you safe. In this holocaust, no one else can do anything.

 I would have started for Lahore today but for the flare-up in Calcutta. If the fury did not abate, my going to the Punjab would be of no avail. I would have no self-confidence.

   DISCUSSION WITH SARAT CHANDRA BOSElibtech_515_footnote  
 September 2, 1947
 GANDHIJI (laughingly): So, it needed a fast on my part to bring you to me?
 SARAT BOSE: I had a feeling that you no more cared for me. But I will not tax your strength. Are you permitted to talk?
I have to, at least in pursuance of the object for which I am
fasting.
 I have always been opposed to partition. I have never made any secret of my views. I am a frank man. I did not come before because, as I have already said, I had a feeling that you had not much use for me.
Representatives of all groups and parties have come and asked
 me why I did not send for you. Some of them said, they had a suspicion that the Forward Bloclibtech_516_footnotelibtech_517_footnotepeople were behind the disturbances. I told them that Sarat Bose knows my door is always open to him. He will come whenever he thinks fit.
 That you have wronged me doth appear in this. In your prayer addresslibtech_518_footnoteyou said   I was spending money like water. . . in corrupt practices.
Was it not then your clear duty to come to me and remove my
 doubts—if they were ill-founded? It is the privilege of friendship to speak out one’s mind unreservedly without the fear of being misunderstood. Otherwise what is friendship worth? Even your Suhrawardy has said, you spend money like water. But if you had a grievance on that score, why did you not contradict it publicly? Or you could have written to me. I would have then either explained to you what I meant, or you would have removed the misconception under which I was labouring. I would have then withdrawn my remarks. That was what true friendship demanded.
 Let bygones be bygones. What is your complaint now against the Forward
  Bloc?   The Hindu Mahasabha 	people say Forward Bloc people are 
 behind 	this holocaust. I owe it to you to place their allegation before      
 you.
 
 
You may believe it if you like. But I tell you, a number of Hindu Mahasabha
  people 	are behind this business. It is they who are inciting the Sikhs by 	telling them that it is unmanly on their part passively to look on 	while the Punjab is burning. I could even mention names. Mutual 	recrimination will lead us nowhere. I am not here to  	judge. My fast is an appeal to everybody to search his heart. It 	should result in all-round self-purification. When the initial 	cleansing of the hearts has been effected, parties of Hindus and 	Muslims should go out together to patrol the troubled areas and 	relieve the police of its arduous duties. Or they should openly say 	they want to fight. What is the use of the Forward Bloc and the 	Hindu Mahasabha bandying words and engaging in mutual recrimination? 	How long can we carry on with the help of the police and the 	military?libtech_519_footnote  	The best use I would have for such tea would be to pour it down the 	drain. But, perhaps, you will retort that strong tea is better than 	weak independence.  The 	deterioration in Bengal set in with the introduction by Suhrawardy 	of armed police from the Punjab. Does he now want the British? No, 	he did not say the British. He only said mixed. But there I  	have a bone to pick with him too. If the hearts of our volunteers 	could be cleansed, peace would immediately return. For that, 	cleansing of the hearts on the part of the leaders is necessary. 	Then alone will they be able to give the masses a clear lead. This 	today is lacking. You should first declare in unequivocal terms what 	you stand for and then back it by appropriate personal example. If 	in the course of it, some topranking leaders are killed, I will not 	grieve. On the contrary, I shall dance with joy. I told the same to 	some leading members of the Marwari community who came to seek my 	advice yesterday.libtech_520_footnotelibtech_521_footnotePeace processions by themselves will be an empty show 	if the basic honesty of intention on the part of the leaders and the 	rank-and-file workers is not there. If such a volunteer organization 	wedded to non-violence and ready to make the supreme sacrifice for 	the achievement of unity and peace begins functioning, I will not 	mind if the entire police force in the city is withdrawn. And if in 	the result the whole of Calcutta swims in blood, it will not dismay 	me. For it will be willing offering of   
   Bose.     
 innocent blood. I know how to tackle such a situation. You and I shall then have to rush barefoot in the midst of the flames and work without respite day and night till either peace is restored or we are all dead. That is my conception of a peace mission—not a mealy-mouthed, milk-and-water business. I do not care if I am alone in these thoughts. Enough unto me is my faith. I shall be content if I get honest and whole-hearted co-operation of you all in this work. We shall then be able to control the situation in the Punjab too.
 I had the authorities withdraw the armed police guard that was posted at my residence. Unfortunately, it has again come back. I have suffered it to remain not for mine but for Suhrawardy’s sake. He feels nervous. If on the night of the 31st August, he had not luckily gone out to get ready for the journey to Noakhali, who knows what might have happened to him, and consequently to me?
 I have often asked why there should be any further trouble now that the League and Jinnah have got what they wanted. If only Jinnah had accepted my offer embodied in the Rajaji Formulalibtech_522_footnote, all this could have been avoided. I was prepared to go even further. If after the
 British had quitted, the collective wisdom and statesmanship of India were still unable to achieve a peaceful solution, I would have invited the Muslim League to take charge of the Government.libtech_523_footnoteThe Congress Ministers would have made way for them if I had asked them to. Pandit Nehru and the Sardar had told me that they would carry out my orders if I took over command.
 I shall endeavour to do my best on your lines for the establishment of peace.

   DISCUSSION WITH P. C. GHOSH  
 September 2, 1947
 GHOSH: You have been very unfair to the Ministry in undertaking the fast without taking them into your confidence.
 GANDHIJI: Perhaps you are right. But the conflagration was spreading so fast that evry moment counted. Any avoidable delay would have meant further loss of innocent lives.
 
 
 I do not wish to prolong the argument.libtech_524_footnote
That is just like you. I had expected of you nothing less.
 One thing, however, strikes me. You have launched your fast at a time when a section of the Hindus have begun to look upon you as their enemy. They foolishly feel that by asking them to practise non-violence, when the other side has shed all scruples, you are being very unfair to them. I would have had nothing to say if you had declared a fast for anything wrong that the Ministry did.
All this is wide of the mark. Don’t you see, this now gives me
 the right to fast against the Muslims, too. My fast is intended to serve both the communities. The moment the Hindus realize  that  they cannot keep me alive on any other terms, peace will return to Calcutta.
 Your fast weighs down on us more than anything else. How can we effectively set to work under the heavy weight of your fast?
It is a wrong way of looking at the thing. My fast is intended to
 strengthen your hands and to spur everybody to greater activity. You will be done for if you regard it as an oppression.
 H. S. Suhrawardy, intervening, said: Already Hindus and Muslims are feeling the pressure. Let us call their representative together and confer with them at the earliest opportunity.
 Dr. Ghosh replied that he had already invited the representatives of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs to meet him the next day. He asked: “Should it be here or at my residence?”
 “Not here but at the Chief Minister’s residence,” suggested Suhrawardy. Gandhiji supported Suhrawardy’s suggestion. A preliminary conference should be held at the Chief Minister’s residence. Afterwards all or a few out of them could come to him, if necessary.
That was also the procedure followed at the time of my twenty-
one days’ fast at Delhi in 1924.libtech_525_footnote
 Dr. Ghosh told Gandhiji of the stringent action his Ministry had already taken in regard to the Press. Any paper indulging in inflammatory propaganda would summarily be suspended.

   DISCUSSION WITH SYAMA PRASAD MOOKERJEE  
 September 2, 1947
 Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee was the next to come. He was accompanied by some other Hindu Mahasabha leaders. Before he could say anything, Gandhiji made solicitous inquiries about his health. This concern for him, by one who was himself fasting, touched Dr. Mookerjee deeply.
 DR. MOOKERJEE: The general feeling here now is in favour of peace. But there is danger of a delayed repercussion in East Bengal. The news from Dacca is disturbing. There may be a flare-up there any moment.
GANDHIJI: It is inevitable if the situation here does not improve
immediately.
 DR. MOOKERJEE: From tomorrow Hindustan National Guards (of Hindu Mahasabha) will be patrolling the streets along with the Muslim National Guards.
 SUHRAWARDY: The bulletins about Gandhiji’s health ought to be more widely publicized. His fast must be terminated within two days.
I will break my fast when Dr. Mookerjee reports that all is quiet
in Calcutta—not before that.

   TALK WITH DINSHAW MEHTA  
 September 3, 1947
 On the 3rd September, the second day of the fast, when Dr. Dinshaw Mehta saw him in the morning, Gandhiji reported that he had had a very peaceful night both physically and mentally.
GANDHIJI: I am not at all anxious to terminate my fast. At this rate
 though the body might become weaker and weaker I feel I could go on even for one month.
 DR. MEHTA (misunderstanding Gandhiji’s meaning): Yes, if you can take that much amount of water there will be no difficulty.
 What I meant to say was that I have a feeling of the presence of God within me this time as  never before.	If Ramanama has fully
penetrated my heart, I am sure, I shall not need to drink even water to survive.

   DISCUSSION WITH HINDU-MUSLIM 		REPRESENTATIVESlibtech_529_footnote  
 September 3, 1947
 One of the Muslims, a prominent member of the Bengal Muslim League, with tears in his eyes entreated Gandhiji to give up his fast. “I worked with you during the Khilafat movement. I undertake that no Muslim in this area will again disturb the peace. Your mere presence in our midst is an asset to us. It is the guarantee of our safety. Do not deprive us of it.”
GANDHIJI: My presence did not check the rowdies the other day.
 My word seems to have lost its power so far as they are concerned. My fast will now be broken only when the conflagration ends and the glorious peace of the last fifteen days returns. If the Muslims really love me and regard me as an asset, they can demonstrate their faith by refusing to give way to the instinct of revenge and retaliation even if the whole of Calcutta goes mad. In the mean time, my ordeal must continue.
 The Hindu representatives also gave a similar assurance and promised to live in peace with their Muslim neighbours. Gandhiji remarked :
The leaven has begun to work.
 But it was not enough, he added. Not till the condition which he had laid down was fulfilled in letter and in spirit, he told the deputation, would he give up the fast. To give it up prematurely from a desire to live would be a denial of God. He asked the
 
 deputation, instead, to work for peace with still greater will and determination. The friends retired with heavy hearts.libtech_530_footnote

   INTERVIEW TOA BRITISH JOURNALISTlibtech_531_footnote  
 CALCUTTA,
 [Before September 4, 1947]libtech_532_footnote
 An English journalist came to Beliaghata the other day. It was a busy day for Gandhiji and he could spare only a few minutes. . . .
 Although Gandhiji’s activities ranged from wide social and political fields to
 the smallest and intensely personal ones, the journalist asked him, how he was able  to maintain a spirit of detachment in such a surprising manner. Gandhiji replied that it was not true that he was never off his balance. Such occasions were rare, yet the long exercise of self-restraint enabled him, through God’s grace,  to  keep  his  irritation within very narrow bounds.
 This led the interviewer on to a more fundamental question. From a reading of Gandhiji’s writings, the friend had gathered that the root  of  all  of  Gandhiji’s activities was the desire for moksha, emancipation. But why was not this aspect emphasized sufficiently ?
 Gandhiji replied by taking recourse to a simile. He said the desire for moksha was indeed there, but it was not meant for anyone other than the individual himself. The world was interested in the fruits, not the root. For the tree itself, however, the chief concern should be not the fruit, but the root. It was in the depth of one’s own being that the individual had to concentrate. He had to nurse it with the water of his labour and suffering. The root was his chief concern. But society was concerned with the fruit alone. It had no other data for judgment than the fruits. Was not a tree judged by its fruits?
 It was this practice of trying to limit himself to the root, and then not be
 concerned about the fruit that had given Gandhiji the apparent detachment which the English friend had noticed. But, in his personal opinion, he was yet far from the fullness of its realization. He was still a soul yearning to be wholly free, but ever failing to reach the ideal which he knew to be true., Hence, it would be enough if he could take care of the immediate task before him, whether great or small, with all the care and freedom from bias or mental worries which he could bring to bear upon it.

   RIGHT OR WRONGlibtech_533_footnote  
 Among my correspondence there is a typical letter in Gujarati from which I give below the following summary :
 In the Young India of 15th September, 1927 A. D., in your Madras speechlibtech_534_footnotereported therein, you have said that that which is opposed to true economics is not religion and that economics which is inconsistent with religion is not true and should, therefore, be denounced.
 I am aware that you have held the view for many years, but it has not commanded universal acceptance. Therefore, it seems to me that your devoting your time and energy to the abatement of atrocities being committed in the name of religion is not proper. Where is your constructive programme today? The National Congress has the reins of Government in the best part of India. Complete political independence is in our hands. The British power has quitted. In such a case, is it not well that you should devote your  energy to the prosecution of the constructive programme and through it demonstrate to the country that religion and economics are not two opposites? . . .libtech_535_footnoteYou write nothing against the unmoral economics of India. The consequence is that credulous people have begun to believe that you are behind the present economic policy of the Congress Government. I have begun to believe that you, who are the  creator of constructive programme, are now destroying it. So far as I know, there is not a single institution connected with khadi or village industries which is based on true economics and on principles of self-sufficiency.
 This writer has written in a moment of excitement. Therefore, he has not been able to express the whole truth. The main fact is that communal unity is a vital part of my being. It was so when khadi and all the village industries were not even conceived by me. At the time communal unity possessed me, I was a lad twelve years old, just a beginner in English. It was then that I had realized that all Hindus and
 
 Harijanbandhu, 14-9-1947.
 
 Muslims and Parsis were sons of the same soil and, as such, were pledged to complete brotherhood. This was before 1885 when the Congress was born. Moreover it should not be forgotten  that communal unity is itself an integral part of the constructive programme. For it I have run many a risk. It is my conviction that if that unity is not achieved, the constructive programme cannot make substantial progress, at least not at my hands. For I should not know how to prosecute it in the midst of communal  disturbances.  The logical consequence of my correspondent’s argument will be that I should not have hastened to Noakhali and thence to Bihar. That is to say, the work that I know how to tackle and which I have been doing for years, I should neglect in the nick of time. Surely this is impossible for me to do. To neglect it for the sake of the other items of the constructive programme would be tantamount to neglect of immediate duty. The result would be, I would have given up what was in my hands and got nothing for the manifest breach of duty.
 Those who are in charge of the Congress Government are my fellow-workers. It is possible to say that they flourished in company with me in the Congress and now occupy top places. If I have failed to convince them of the soundness and feasibility of the economics referred to by the correspondent, how should I expect to convince others? They do not feel that they would be able to carry the people of India with them in the prosecution of what may be summed up as the ‘Khadi Economics’ and to renovate the villages of India through village industries.
 He (the correspondent) rather suggests taht I should prepare Shri  Jajujilibtech_536_footnotelibtech_537_footnote,  Shri  Kumarappalibtech_538_footnotelibtech_539_footnoteand  such  like   to   take   the   reins   of Government in their hands. What hallucination is this? What right have I so to prepare people? Government of the people, by the people and for the people cannnot be conducted at the bidding of one man, however great he may be. Again who are more capable or penetrating than the present holders of the reins of Government? When more capable men are found, I am sure they will give place to their betters. As far as I know them they are not place-hunters. Therefore without being told by anybody they will of their own accord give place to abler hands and feel grateful for what will amount to a relief for them.
Let no one make the mistake of thinking that I can replace any
 
 one of them. I know that they would welcome me if I was ready to shoulder the burden. But I must confess that I have not unlimited capacity in me. That belongs to God, whom I love to invoke as Rama. But I am only His humble devotee. His devotees cannot claim to be He. They have got to dance to His tune.
 It is worthy of note, too, that they themselves are giving the best part of their time to the very work of communal harmony, which I try to do. I in my own way, they in theirs. For they, too, believe with me that so long as this question is not satisfactorily settled and peace does not reign in India, nation-building works can make little or no progress.
 Finally those who think like my correspondent should realize that the constructive programme, to be of any use, has to be reduced to practice by the millions of India. For that purpose we  need thousands of workers. it is of little consequence that it was conceived by one brain. It has been before the country for years. The All-India Spinners’ Association, the Village Industries Association, the Goseva Sangh, the Talimi Sangh, the Hindustani Prachar Sabha, the Adivasi Seva Sangh, the Harijan Sevak Sangh and such others which might have escaped my memory, came into being for that very purpose and are still working according to their capacity. All of them have realized the necessity and beauty of the relation between religion and economics. Whilst I am doing communal work, my interest in other constructive activities has not flagged. Whenever I can, I take part in their deliberations too. More should not be expected of me. I dare not leave the work in hand, being tempted to run after another, probably better. Hence the warning that the correspondent has given me should really be taken to heart by himself and by those who think alike and they should whole-heartedly devote themselves to the service of the nation in which they may be engaged.
 I have repeated times without number that for national work it is not necessary that national workers should have political power. But it is necessary for the people to keep in constant touch with those whom they put in power. These can easily be counted. They are too few. But if the people were to realize their power and use it wisely and well, things would right themselves. Our independence is a new-born baby eighteen days old. It is inconceivable that things would of themselves be arranged harmoniously. Moreover those who have been placed
 in power are themselves new to this vast administrative work. They are assiduously adapting themselves to it.

   LETTER TOKHWAJA NAZIMUDDINlibtech_540_footnote  
 September 4, 1947
 This will be presented to you by Pyarelal.  You may know  that Satis Babu and some inmates of Khadi Pratishthan together with the helpers, whom I brought with me from Delhi, were posted in Noakhali to help the terror-struck and demoralized Hindus and, if possible, to prevent them from running away from Noakhali.        In
 doing so, I felt that I was serving the Muslims, too,  of  Noakhali, though they stood in no need of help from me. But on reaching there  I found taht I could be of some help to them also. I had announced that I would do or die in Noakhali in the sense that I would prefer to die there unless through what I could do the two communities should become friends. Meantime, there came a call from Bihar. . . and I hurried to Bihar, this time to help the Muslims  of  whom  large numbers had already fled to Bengal, Sind and other Muslim-majority parts. Since then I have not been able to return to Noakhali. When at last I came to Calcutta on the 9th ultimo, I found myself caught by Shaheed Saheb and here I am. The sequel you know.
 I am dictating this letter from my bed. Everybody consoles me by saying that the first fifteen days of peace will soon return. If so, I may be able to break my fast early enough to enable me to resume my work forthwith. I have an urgent call from both parts of the Punjab, which have gone, in my opinion, utterly mad. Meanwhile, I would like you to tell me all about Noakhali. Pyarelal will tell you all about it from my point of view. I know that you have become

   TALK WITH DR. SUNIL BOSElibtech_543_footnote  
 September 4, 1947 Gandhiji told him he could not exclude relevant talk. Such necessary loss of  energy was inevitable. He was certainly desirous of living, but not at the cost of work
 that duty demanded. He said :
 I can’t interrupt the work which has made me fast and which makes me live. If my life ebbs away in the process, I would feel happy.

   DISCUSSION WITH FRIENDSlibtech_544_footnote  
 September 4, 1947
 The present occasion was not one in which there was scope for a sympathetic fast. Hindus and Muslims had fought for one whole year, at the end of which the major parties had agreed that India should be divided into two States. Both had Hindu and Muslim subjects. It was now time for everyone to create the sense of common citizenship, to rebuild the land so that men might taste the fruits of freedom. To this end all should work. Gandhiji said that if the friends had come to him only for the sake of saving his life, it was nothing.
 Referring to the Poona Fast which ended with the desired amendment of the Communal Award, [Gandhiji said that] it was suggested by some that though the amendment was not to their desire, they accepted it for the sake of saving his life. This was a wholly wrong approach. Such fasts were intended to stir the conscience and remove mental sluggishness. Truth could not be sacrificed even for the sake of saving a life, however precious it was. Gandhiji, therefore, warned the present company that they should create real Hindu-Muslim unity by educating the people in a sense of common citizenship of the State, where every single man enjoyed perfect equality of rights which flowed from duty performed. If they worked with this aim in view, and succeeded after a few days’ effort in making the Muslims in Calcutta feel safe where they now did not, it would be time for him to break the fast. Gandhiji was
 
 clearly of opinion that although his work was now confined to Calcutta, yet his one aim with respect to the Hindu-Muslim question was that the solution would be complete only when the minority, whether in the Indian Union or in Pakistan felt perfectly safe even if they were in the minority of one. There would be no favoured and no depressed community anywhere. All should forget their religious affiliations. He was working to this end. He was working in such a manner that the majority community in each State should go forward and create the necessary conditions for freedom.
 Someone asked him: Was it possible that his fast would have any effect on the anti-social elements in society? Today, i.e., during the present recrudescence, it was this element which had gained the upper hand. Could their hearts be converted by Gandhiji’s crucifixion ?
 Gandhiji’s answer was very clear and emphatic. He said that goondas were there because we had made them so. During the past one year of anarchy, it was understandable how these elements in society had gained respectability. But the war between Pakistanis and those for Undivided India had ended. It was time for peace- loving citizens to assert themselves and isolate goondaism. Non-violent non-co- operation was a universal remedy. Good was self-existent, evil was not. It was like a parasite living on and round good. It would die of itself when the support that good gave was withdrawn. The hearts of the anti-social elements may or may not be changed; it would be enough if they were made to feel that the better elements of society were asserting themselves in the interest of peace and in the interest of normality.
 To the interviewers from Central Calcutta Gandhiji’s advice, therefore, was thet they should desist from a sympathetic fast, go forth among the oppressed in each quarter, assure them that they were safe and rebuild life so that safety would be a permanent feature of the new State of India. He would personally have loved to move about from quarter to quarter in Calcutta in order to place his views before the various bodies, but his physical condition would not permit it. If others worked, how could he rest? Yet he was bound to make his contribution. He felt that it should be in the shape of a fast.
 Harijan, 14-9-1947
  
   DISCUSSION WITH A DEPUTATIONlibtech_545_footnote  
 September 4, 1947
 Gandhiji told them that he would break his fast only when they could assure him that there would never again be recrudescence of communal madness in the city even though the whole of West Bengal and, for that matter, India, might go forth into  a blaze, and the Muslims themselves would come and tell him that they now felt safe and secure and, therefore, he need not further prolong his fast.libtech_546_footnoteHe did not expect, he proceeded to explain, to be able to control all the goondas in the city, though he would love to, as he had not the requisite degree of purity, detachment and steadfastness of mind. But if he could not even make them purge themselves of the communal virus, he would feel that life was not worth living and he would not care to prolong it. They had referred to the oppression of his fast. He could not understand that. Why should they have a feeling of oppression if what they had told him came right from their hearts? If a single step was taken under pressure of the fast, not from conviction, it would cause oppression; but there should be no oppression if there was complete co-operation between the head and the heart.
The function of my fast is to purify, to release our energies by
 overcoming our inertia and mental sluggishness, not to paralyse us or to render us inactive. My fast isolates the forces of evil; the moment they are isolated they die, for evil by itself has no legs to stand upon. I expect you therefore to work with even greater vigour under the instigation of my fast, not to feel its oppression.

   ADVICE TODEMONSTRATORSlibtech_547_footnote  
 September 4, 1947
 My penalty for you is that you should go immediately among the Muslims and assure them full protection. The moment I am convinced that real change of heart has taken place, I will give up the fast. Let me tell you I am as anxious to end the fast as you, as I want to proceed to the Punjab at the earliest. That is what is sustaining me in my ordeal. But if you do not now hurry up it may be too late. I cannot last for many more days.

   DISCUSSION WITH CITIZENS’ DEPUTATIONlibtech_548_footnote  
 CALCUTTA,
 September 4, 1947
 The deputation told Gandhiji that they had been to all the affected parts of the city and there was quiet everywhere. They would hold themselves responsible for anything untoward that might happen thereafter. They had every reason to hope that there would be no recrudescence of trouble which they maintained was “really not communal” but “the work of the goondas”. They requested him to terminate his fast.
 After some reflection Gandhiji spoke. He deprecated the suggestion that the outbreak of violence was not communal in character but really the work of the goondas.
It is we who make the goondas and we alone can unmake them.
Goondas never act on their own. By themselves they cannot function.
 It was the cowardice or passive sympathy of the average citizen or “the man with a stake” that gave the so-called goondas the power to do mischief.
My fast should make you more vigilant, more truthful,  more
careful, more precise in the language you use. You have all come here
 
 out of affection for me to ask me to give up my fast. The ringleaders also have been to see me and have apologized for what they have done.libtech_549_footnoteBut before I can accede to your request, I want to ask you two questions: (1) Can you in all sincerity assure me that there never will be repetition of trouble in Calcutta? Can you say that there is  a  genuine change of heart among the citizens so that they will no longer tolerate, much less foster, communal frenzy? If you cannot give that guarantee, you should rather let me continue this fast. It won’t hurt me. When a man fasts like this, it is not the gallons of water he drinks that sustains him but God; and (2) if trouble breaks out—since you are not omnipotent or even omniscient—would you give me your word of honour that you would not live to report failure but lay down your life in the attempt to protect those whose safety  you  are pledging? You should remember, too, that if you break your pledge after giving it to me, you will have to face an unconditional fast unto death on my part. I do not wish to live in a fool’s paradise. If you deceive me, if you say one thing and mean another in your heart, my death will be upon your heads. I want a clear and straight answer. Your assurance must be in writing.
 SUHRAWARDY: You had said that you would break the fast when Calcutta returned to sanity. That condition has already been fulfilled. In asking us to give a guarantee for the future, are you not imposing a fresh condition ?
 Characterizing Shaheed’s argument as “legalistic”, Gandhiji replied that no fresh condition was being imposed. All that was implied in the original terms of the fast.
What I have spoken now is only a home truth to make you know
 what is what. If there is complete accord between your conviction and feeling, there should be no difficulty in signing that declaration. It is the acid test of your sincerity and courage of conviction. If you sign it merely to keep me alive, you will really be compassing my certain death.
 SUHRAWARDY: In such a big city, things may happen in spite of our best efforts. Surely, you cannot fast for any stray incident that may happen.
 Gandhiji explained to Shaheed that he had missed his point. He did not mean that Calcutta would become completely free from all crime for good. All he meant was that even if madness should seize the whole country, Calcutta would not lose its head.libtech_550_footnote
 
 SUHRAWARDY: Now that even the Muslims have joined in the appeal, won’t you break your fast? This shows that they have fully accepted your peace mission although they are the aggrieved party in the present riots. It is all the more strange because at one time they looked upon you as their arch enemy. But their hearts have been so touched by the services you have rendered them that today they acclaim you as their friend and helper.
 RAJAJI: If I may vary the language, I would say that he is safer today in the hands of the Muslims than in those of the Hindus.
G. Do not think of Muslims as the aggrieved party. The essence
 of our present peace mission is that we are to forget the past. I do not want the Muslims to feel that in West Bengal they are the underdog. Unless we can forget the distinction, we will not have done solid work.libtech_551_footnote
 S. But, Sir, is it any good my signing this document? I may any time be called to Pakistan and then what happens to my pledge ?
G. You must in that event have confidence that those whom you
leave behind will deliver the goods. Moreover, you can come back.
 S. I have no desire to hoodwink you and I never will do so deliberately.
 G. Well, I will break this fast now and leave for the Punjab tomorrow. I shall now go there with far greater strength and confidence than I could have three days ago.
 S. You cannot leave tomorrow. Your presence is necessary here at least for a couple of days yet to consolidate the peace.

 Kripalani proposed that they might confer among themselves leaving Gandhiji for a while. Just then they received an appeal signed by Hindu and Muslim representatives of the “worst affected” localities.  The  signatories  had  promised  “not to   allow any untoward incident” and begged Gandhiji to break his fast. When Suhrawardy read out the appeal and remarked that their effort had not been in vain, Gandhiji replied, “Yes, the leaven is at work.”  What follows is extracted from Pyarelal’s report   in Harijan.
   SPEECH BEFOREBREAKING OFFAST  
 CALCUTTA,
 September 4, 1947 I would like to tell you something before breaking the fast. I am breaking this fast so  that I  might be  able to  do  something for the
Punjab. I am doing so at your assurance and not for any other reason.
 It would indeed be very unfortunate if anything happened to make me regret my step. I would like to live—as people tell me—to serve all the more. I have the will power to live and would like to live but I do not want to be deceived in order to live. I expect that the Hindus and Muslims here will not force me to undertake a fast again. On the first day Rajaji had asked me whether I had undertaken the fast hoping for something to happen. I told him that people would not let me prolong the fast. It lasted for three days, it could have for thirty.
 Still I would like to warn you that you should not be lulled into complacence after I break my fast. What happens here is bound to have its effect in the Punjab and Noakhali. If something happens here how can I control the rowdy Muslims in Noakhali? Calcutta today holds the key to the peace of the whole of India. If you want to achieve great things, you must work for them. Even if the whole world went up in a blaze, Calcutta should remain untouched by the flames. May God grant wisdom to everyone. These girls have just now sung Ishwar Allah tere nam, sabko sanmati de Bhagwan. And, of course, above all, there is God, our witness.libtech_552_footnote

   MESSAGE TO UNESCO CONFERENCE ON EDUCATIONlibtech_553_footnote  
 [Before September 5, 1947]libtech_554_footnoteI am deeply interested in the efforts of the United Nations Economic, Social and Cultural Organization to secure peace through
educational and cultural activities. I fully appreciate that real security
 and lasting peace cannot be secured so long as extreme inequalities in education and culture exist as they do among the nations of the world. Light must be carried even to the remotest homes in the less fortunate countries which are in comparative darkness, and I think that in this cause the nations which are economically and educationally advanced have a special responsibility. I wish your Conference every success, and I hope that you will be able to produce a workable plan for provinding the right type of education particularly in countries in which opportunities for education are restricted owing to economic and other circumstances.
 Harijan, 16-11-1947
 
   APPEAL TOFRIENDS  
 [Before September 5, 1947] Gandhiji has been receiving letters and telegrams from friends asking for permission to come to Calcutta to help in any matter. Gandhiji would warn friends against rushing to Calcutta. Any such arrival would complicate matters. He has efficient nursing and other necessary attendants. He, therefore, requires no extra help
 for his bodily assistance.
 Accommodation in his new residence is strictily limited as it is all over Calcutta. Food is rationed. In this condition of scarcity Gandhiji is of opinion that those friends including Ashram members, who are naturally anxious to be near him should understand him and respect his wish that they should restrain themselves against their natural desire. They will help him
 on the contrary by strict adherence to their duty in which they are at present engaged.
 Gandhiji wishes to add that he is perfectly at peace and ease and has fullest trust in God’s succour.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 
 
CALCUTTA,
  Spetember 	6, 1947  Gandhiji, 	referring to the 	Deputy Mayor’s speech, 	said that the word 	farewell was 	misapplied. He 	had made 	his home 	in Calcutta 	among the 	Muslim friends in 	Beliaghata and 	not in Khadi 	Pratishthan, Sodepur, 	which was his permanent 	home. He 	would not 	even allow Hemprobha 	Devi and 	her co-workers to 	come to 	his new 	abode for 	looking after 	him. He said 	that he would 	be satisfied 	with what Muslim 	friends gave 	him in the 	shape of 	service. He 	had made no mistake. He 	was accustomed to 	living comfortably in 	Muslim homes in South Africa.  He 	then referred to the martyrdom of Sachin Mittralibtech_561_footnoteand Smritish 	Banerjee. He was not 	sorry. Such innocent 	deaths were necessary 	to keep 	the two communities 	together. Let 	them not 	make the 	mistake that such martyrs 	were to be found 	among Hindus only. He 	could cite 	several instances of 	Muslims who 	had lost their lives in 	the act of 	protecting Hindus. He 	had had similar 	personal experiences in 	life. There 	was evil 	and good 	among all communities 	and climes. 	That brought him to 	Shaheed Saheb 	about whom he had many Hindus coming to him, and many letters from 	them to the effect 	that he 	was a 	fool to 	have accepted 	Shaheed Saheb as 	his associate 	in the 	task.  He 	must say 	that he 	was no 	fool.  He 	knew what he 	was doing. 	 He had 	nothing  to do with 	what Shaheed Saheb had 	done in 	the past. 	But he 	(Gandhiji) was 	there to 	testify that he 	(Shaheed Saheb) had 	given his 	full co-operation all 	the precious days 	they were together. He 	was free 	to confess 	that without his valuable 	help they would not 	have found him 	(Gandhiji) working in 	their midst. It 	was an insult to 	intelligence to think 	that there 	could be any 	base motive 	behind the work 	into which he 	had thrown 	himself with his whole 	heart. He had 	a palatial 	house and a 	brother whom he 	regarded as 	superior to 	him in 	talent. He 	had another 	whom Gandhiji 	had had the 	pleasure of 	knowing in 	London at 	the Round Table 	Conference and 	who was Vice- Chancellor 	of the 	Dacca University. 	His uncle 	Sir Abdulla 	was the author 	of the 	Sayings of 	the Prophet. 	If they distrusted 	the motives, they 	would  be  vastly 	mistaken. Neither they 	nor anybody else 	had any right to 	question a 	man’s motives. 	The speaker 	said that he would 	not like 	his motives 	to be judged 	by his 	actions. That 	was the only right way 	to get 	on with 	people. They 	should know that he had 	been condemned 	as enemy 	No. 1 	of Islam 	and that 	in spite 	of his 	protestations to 	the contrary. 	Would the audience, 	therefore, like the 	Muslims never to 	accept his 	actions  at 	their worth?  Lastly 	let them consider the awful consequence of such distrust. I might 	ruin the present unity and thus jeopardize what probably was the 	only chance of saving the Punjab from fratricidal strife.  He 	then referred to the Shanti Sena and other organizations which were 	doing    
 strenuous work to preserve peace. Women had come forward to do their bit. The students had excelled themselves in their devotion to the cause of communal amity. Some young men had brought their unlicensed arms including stenguns, hand- grenades and other less destructive weapons. He thanked them for their courage in bringing them to him. He hoped that the good example would be copied by all possessors, Hindus and Muslims, of unlicensed arms. It would be a proof of mutual trust and trust in God. He was assured by the Chief Minister that those who delivered up such arms within a given date (the shorter the better) would be thanked for their open help in the work of peace and that no punishment would be inflicted on them, now or hereafter, for what was undoubtedly an offence. He asked, therefore, all such possessors to deliver these to the authorities or to their friends, to be delivered to the authorities.
 He congratulated the Corporation staff which the Deputy Mayor told him, had worked the whole night for completing the arrangements for the meeting which was so well attended in spite of the rains.
 Last of all, he told them that by breaking the fast only after one day’s absence of strife, on the strength of the pressure of friends drawn from all communities in Calcutta and outside, he threw the burden on them of preservation of peace at the cost of their lives.libtech_562_footnoteLet them not be guilty of having, though unwittingly, brought about his death by the abrupt end of the fast. He could have, as they might have, waited for some days to enable him to gauge the situation for himself, but he could not properly do so in the face of the earnestness of friends, say like Shri N. C. Chatterjee, the President of the Hindu Mahasabha, Shaheed Saheb and others too numerous to mention, but he threw all the greater weight on the shoulders of all Calcutta citizens and sojourners. What they wanted was not peace imposed by the Government forces but by themselves.  If, unfortunately it was broken, there would be no alternative but  a fast unto death. He could not, like a child, play with them and each time say, he was going to break his fast if they resumed sanity. He made that solemn declaration for Bihar, then for Noakhali and now for Calcutta. As his life was made, he had no other alternative. If God willed that he should still do some service, He would bless all with wisdom to do the right thing in the matter. Consider the consequence of Calcutta remaining sane. It must mean the automatic sanity of all Bengal, East and West. It meant also Bihar and consequently the Punjab where God was sending him, and if the Punjab came to its senses, the rest of India was bound to follow. So may God help them all.

Courtesy: 	National Archives of India        SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_569_footnote      CALCUTTA,  September 	7, 1947    Gandhiji 	said within the last few days the Shanti Sena had done excellent 	work and there appeared to be a need for them in Calcutta. He was 	going away but would be watching the situation. Those who belonged 	to the Shanti Sena must be prepared to sacrifice themselves in the 	interest of peace. If they really counted themselves as members of 	that organization they should come in between warring factions and 	stop the fight even to the extent of losing their lives. They were 	fighting not with swords but with love.  Soldiers 	who go to war, Gandhij continued, die and those who remain alive are 	acclaimed as heroes. Mahatma Gandhi said it was really those who 	died that kept others alive and they were the real heroes. Some 	members of the Shanti Sena had sacrificed their lives in the cause 	of peace. They were the real heroes and peace had been restored on 	account of their sacrifice. Gandhiji wished to see whether this 	peace     
 was going to be permanent —whether it was founded on true friendship and love.
 There was another work before them and that was to bring back those to their homes who had been driven away or whose homes had been looted or destroyed. They had got to provide shelter for them as well as food till they were able to stand on their own legs. The Central Peace Committee had taken up this work and a Finance Committee had been formed to raise funds for the purpose. The work had to be done as soon as possible. They were not to see whether other people were doing the same thing elsewhere. Gandhiji did not wish to hear any Hindu saying that he should first see what Muslims were doing to rehabilitate the Hindus and vice versa.
 Mahatma Gandhi concluded by saying that each one should start to be good irrespective of what anyone else was doing; and the goodness of one would be reflected in another.

   SPEECH AT GOBRA LEPROSY HOSPITALlibtech_570_footnote  
 CALCUTTA,
 [September 7, 1947]libtech_571_footnoteGandhiji visited the Leprosy Hospital this evening before leaving Calcutta. Addressing the patients and the staff he said that the he considered it wrong that
 leprosy should carry more stigma than any other infectious disease. Real stigma in
 his opinion attached to moral ailments rather than to physical ones. Drunkards, gamblers and those who suffered from such other ailments of society deserved far more abhorrence than a disease like leprosy. He advised them to take refuge in God. He alone was the Healer of all ailments—physical, mental or moral.libtech_572_footnote
 The members of the asylum had no occasion whatsoever to feel dejected. The fact that moral lepers were worse than the physical ones was surely a matter of some consolation to them. The real consolation lay in their utter reliance on God. Then they would not feel the want of games and other aids to whiling away time. This however did not mean that society did not owe a great duty to the lepers in its midst who after all were the outward symbol of society’s many blemishes which being general were not noticed. He thought that the abhorrence which was shown towards lepers was a superstition born of ignorance. This he had learnt during his visits to most of the leper asylums of India.

   A NOTE  
 [After September 7, 1947]libtech_573_footnote
 A gentleman from Phulwari Sharif came to see me yesterday. He stated that the returning Muslims are being threatened by  Hindus there who do not allow them to cultivate their fields. Sikhs come from outside and say all sorts of things. If this is correct, do enquire into the matter; and people must be prevented from behaving thus. You may publish this note, if necessary, to do so. A fake picture of a naked woman is being distributed. It is very bad if it is a fact.

   TASK BEFOREMINISTERSlibtech_574_footnote  
 I have before me quite a number of letters fiercely criticizing what they consider to be their luxurious life. They accuse them too of favouritism, even nepotism. I know that much criticism comes from ignorance. Ministers should not be sensitive. They should take in good part even carping criticism. They would be surprised if I were to send them the letters I receive; probably, they receive worse. Be that as it may, the moral I draw from them is that the critics expect much more from these chosen servants of the people than from others in the way of simplicity, courage, honesty and industry. In this matter we cannot imitate the English rulers of the past, except perhaps in industry and discipline. The whole purpose of this note will be served if on the one hand the ministers profit by valid criticism and the critics learn to be sober and precise about their facts. Inaccuracy or exaggeration spoils a good case.

   BIHAR FORBIHARIS AND INDIA  
 Bihar is undoubtedly for Biharis but it is also for India. What is true of Bihar is equally true of all the provinces in the Union. No Indian can be treated as a foreigner in Bihar as he may be treated in Pakistan of today and vice versa. It is necessary to bear this difference in mind if we are to avoid difficulties and heart-burn[ing].
 Though then every Indian of the Union has a right to settle in Bihar, he must not do so to oust the Biharis. If the qualification was not actively operated, it is possible to conceive such an inrush of non- Bihari Indians as to flood out the Biharis. We are thus forced to the conclusion that a non-Bihari who settles in Bihar must do so to serve Bihar, not to exploit it after the manner of our old masters.
 This way of examining the proposition brings us to the question of the zamindars and the ryots. When a non-Bihari enters Bihar for the sake of making money, he will in all probability do so to exploit the ryot in league with the zamindars. If the zamindars really became the
 
 trustees of their zamindari for the sake of the ryots, there never could be an unholy league as has been here conceived. There is the difficult zamindari question awaiting solution in Bihar. What one would love to see is proper impartial and satisfactory understanding between the zamindars, big and small, the ryots and the Government, so that when the law is passed it may not be a dead letter nor need force be used against the zamindars or the ryots. Would that all changes, some of which must be radical, took place throughout India without bloodshed and without force! So much for the newcomer from the other  provinces of India.
 What about the services? It seems that if the provinces are all to make equal progress in all directions the services should be largely confined to the inhabitants of the province concerned for the sake of India as a whole. No province and no tribe or clan can be kept backward if India is to stand up erect before the world. It will never do so through its arms of which the world is sick. It must shine through its innate culture expressed in every citizens’s life and in the socialism I have recentlydescribed in these columns. That means elimination of all force for the sake of popularizing one’s doctrines or schemes. A thing which is truly popular rarely, if ever, requires force save that of public opinion to make itself acceptable to all. Therefore, the ugly scenes of violence by individuals witnessed in Bihar and Orissa and Assam should never have been. Popular Governments are functioning to redress any irregularity or encroachment by persons from other provinces. The provincial Governments are bound to give full protection to all the comers from outside their provinces. “Use what you consider yours so as not to injure others,” is a famous maxim of equity. It is also a grand moral code of conduct. How apposite today?
 Hitherto I have dealt with the question of new arrivals. What of those who were on the 15th of August in Bihar—some in Government employment and some otherwise employed? So far as I can see, they should be on the same footing as the Biharis unless they make another choice. Naturally they should not form a separate colony as if they were foreigners. “Live in Rome as the Romans do,” is a sound commonsense maxim so long as it does not apply to Roman vices. The process of progressive blending must be one of rejecting the bad and absorbing the good. As a Gujarati in Bengal, I must quickly absorb all that is good in Bengal and never touch that which is bad; I must ever serve Bengal, never selfishly exploit it. The bane of our life is our exclusing provincialism, whereas my province must be co-
 
 extensive with the Indian boundary so that ultimately it extends to the boundary of the earth. Else, it perishes.

   PROHIBITION OFINTOXICANTSlibtech_575_footnote  
 This is the fittest time for this reform. Thesre is a people’s Government. Both parts of India including the Indian States are ready for the reform. All over the two parts there is a shortage of foodstuffs and clothing. Dare one think of indulging in intoxicants—drinks or drugs—when people are on the border-land of starvation and nakedness? The money spent on wines and opiates is not only a waste, but it adds to it loss of self-control. One labouring under the influence of intoxicants will do things which he will never do in a sober state. Thus from every point of view prohibition is a vital necessity.
 We cannot eradicate the evil merely by passing laws. The addict will manage to satisfy his craving anyhow. Those carrying on the black trade will not readily give it up.
 Therefore the following steps will have to be taken simult- aneously in order to make a success of the reform :
 Passing 	of the requisite law Educating 	public opinion  Opening 	at the 	same place as grog 	shops refreshmentrooms 	selling harmless drinks 	and providing 	innocent entertainment in 	the form 	of books, newspapers, games, etc.  The 	income from 	the sale of intoxicants 	should be spent 	on cultivating 	public opinion in favour 	of prohibition. 
 It is criminal to spend the income from the sale of intoxicants on the education of the nation’s children or other publice services. The Government must overcome the temptation of using such revenue for nation-building purposes. Experience has shown that the moral and physical gain of the abstainer more than makes up for the loss of this tainted revenue. If we eradicate the evil, we will easily find other ways and means of increasing the nation’s income.

    STATEMENT TOTHE PRESS      NEW 	DELHI, 
  September 	9, 1947  	‘Man proposes, God disposes’ has come true often enough in my 	lifetime as it must have done in many others’. I knew nothing 	about the sad state of things in Delhi when I left Calcutta on 	Sunday last. On reaching Delhi, I have been listening the whole day 	long to the tale of woe that is Delhi today. I saw several Muslim 	friends who recited their pathetic story. I heard enough to warn me 	that I must not leave Delhi for the Punjab until it had regained its 	former self.  	I must do my little bit to calm the heated atmosphere. I must apply 	the old formula “Do or Die” to the capital of India. I am glad 	to be able to say that the residents of Delhi do not want the 	senseless destruction that is going on. I am prepared to understand 	the anger of the refugees whom fate has driven from West Punjab. But 	anger is short madness. It can only make matters worse in every  	way. Retaliation is no remedy. It makes the original disease much 	worse. I, therefore, ask all those who are engaged in the senseless 	murders, arson and loot to stay their hands.  	The Central Government, the ablest, the most courageous and the most 	self-sacrificing team that the Union could produce, have not been in 	the saddle for even a month after the declaration of Indian 	independence. It is criminal and suicidal not to give them a chance 	to set the house in order. I am fully aware of the shortage of food. 	Mob rule is dislocating everything making distribution of 	food-stuffs all but impossible. May God restore peace to distracted 	Delhi.  	I would close with the hope that Calcutta will fulfil the promise 	made on my departure and which sustains me in the midst of the 	surrouding madness.  Harijan, 	21-9-1947 
  
   TALK WITH P. C. JOSHI  
 [After September 9, 1947]libtech_576_footnote
 Answering Shri P. C. Joshilibtech_577_footnote, Gandhiji said:
 First of all I want you not to report our conversation in any paper. Not that I have anything to conceal, but it will not help the cause. The situation for me is baffling. I do not remember  an  occasion in my life– and it has been a life full of struggle–when I have felt baffled as I am doing today. It is a matter of shame for us that the Mussalmans in the Union should feel downcast. Here there should be no room for a single person to feel downcast. Is it so today? No. Only today I heard that Dr. Kitchlewlibtech_578_footnotelibtech_579_footnotehas had to leave his home. It is a frightful thing that he cannot stay in his own house and has to go to Kashmir. I wholly endorse your remark that no one in the Union can afford to say that we are doing this by way of retaliation, and that too of a savage type. We must not degrade ourselves by following the ways of Pakistan. Somehow or other I have never felt so resourceless as I am doing today. You say mobilize all the democratic forces and give them the marching orders. But I feel like a General without an army. To whom am I to give orders?
 JOSHI. It is not true. The General has no confidence in himself. He is not calling the army. Calcutta was a hundred times worse than Delhi.
 GANDHIJI. You do not know the story of Calcutta.  There  it  looked literally like overnight conversion. It would not have happened but for the incident that night You know the details of the attack on me. They saw my behaviour with their own eyes. That turned the wave. The Muslim mind was ready. The trading mind was tired of strife and the mischievous elements saw that whatever they did was a misfire. They must desist.
 It was like the overnight conversion of the European mind in South Africa. I was lynched. I might have been killed but for the resourcefulness of the European Superintendent of Police. When the whole thing including my interview appeared in the press the next
 
   1947.      
 morning, the Europeans felt ashamed and the atmosphere changed.libtech_580_footnoteIf some such thing happened here, my mission would succeed. But I am afraid it will not happen.
 JOSHI. No. They have learnt the lesson. They want the old man to quit and then have a second round.
 GANDHIJI. Yes. I know that. That is why I have pledged myself to do or die in Delhi.
 Joshi: You have made the nation. You must take them on. Give the call.
 GANDHIJI. I have made them and I have unmade them. I have not mastered your technique. I have not got that amazing self- assurance and I am not sorry for it. I simply say take me for what I am worth.
 I have no enemies. Therefore the Communists too in spite of all their differences with me come to me. They came in Noakhali too. I had given them five minutes. But I took to them and gave them an hour and asked them to come again. I know the stuff you are made of Most of you are young men. I shall pick from you what I can.
 JOSHI. Do not say that.
 GANDHIJI. I mean what I say. I am biding my time. I am very patient. My patience is being taxed to the utmost. Keep in touch with me. Kumaramangalam sees me often. So does Habib, Dr. Mahmud’s son. He is a fine young man. He never puts his parents in an awkward position, never comes in their way, but goes on with his work. And he is so brave. I keep myself in touch with all who come to me. I know you have some fine stuff amongst your ranks. If you had just riff-faff who have their own axes to grind, you cannot lead such a party.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_581_footnote       NEW 	DELHI, 
  September 	10, 1947  BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	When I reached Shahadara Sardar Patel, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and 	others were there to welcome me. But I did not find the usual smile 	on the Sardar’s lips. Gone too was his jocular temperament. After 	alighting from the train I found some police personnel and others 	also equally sad. Has the city of Delhi which always appeared gay 	turned into a city of the dead? Another surprise was in store for 	me. Instead of the Harijan colony where it was a pleasure to stay I 	was taken to the palatial Birla House. I was greatly pained to know 	the reason for this. Even so, I was pleased to stay in a house where 	I had often come and stayed on earlier occasions. Whether I stay 	with the Valmiki friends in the Harijan colony or at the Birla 	House, I am a guest of the Birla brothers. Even if I am in the 	Harijan colony their men look after me with total devotion. It is 	not the Sardar who is responsible for this. He can never be so weak 	as to be concerned about my safety in the Bhangi Colony. I am always 	very happy to be in the midst of the Harijans, though, I cannot live 	in the very houses in which the Bhangis, through the negligence of 	the New Delhi Committee, are packed like sardines.  	I have been brought to stay at Birla House because refugees have 	been accommodated in the Harijan colony. Their need is much greater 	than mine. But is it not a shame on us as a nation that there should 	be any problem about refugees in our country? Along with Pandit 	Nehru and Sardar Patel, Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah, Liaqat Ali Khan and 	other Pakistani leaders had declared that in the Indian Union as 	well as in Pakistan the minority communities would receive the same 	treatment as the majority communities. Did the leaders of these 	Dominions make such declaration to please world opinion or was it 	their intention to prove that there was no difference between their    
 words and deeds and that they would be ready to lay down their lives in order to fulfil their promises? If that is so, I would like to ask why were the Hindus, Sikhs and the proud Amils, and their friends forced to leave Pakistan? What has happened in Quetta, Nawab Shah and Karachi? The reports of tratic events in the West Punjab are heart- rending. The leaders of the Indian Union and Pakistan cannot fling their hands in despair and say that it is all the doing of the goondas. It is the duty of the Dominions to accept full responsibility for the actions of its people—their duty is “not to reason why” but “to do and die”. Now they are not forced to do anything against their will under the crushing burden of Imperialism. Today they can do anything they choose. But if they wish to face the world with honesty, freedom should not mean that there need be no rule of law in both the Dominions. Would the Union Ministers declare their bankruptcy and shamelessly say that the people of Delhi and the refugees who are staying there do not, of their own free will wish to abide by the law of the land? As for me, I would expect the Ministers to stake their own lives in fighting this madness rather than submitting to it.
 Even at the house where I am staying, fruits or vegetables are not available. Is it not shameful that the Subzi Mandi has stopped receiving any supplies of vegetables because some Muslims have fired some shots? During my rounds in the city I heard complaints that the refugees do not get their ration. And whatever is being supplied to them is not fit for human consumption. If the responsibility for this lies with the Government, it equally lies with the refugees who have brought to a standstill even the essential services. Why do they not realize that they are harming their own interests by resorting to such action? Had they trusted the Government for the solution of all their problems and behaved like law-abiding citizens, I know and they should know it, too, that most of their problems would have been solved.
 I visited the camp of the Meos near the Humayun’s Tomb. I was told that they had been turned out from the States of Alwar and Bharatpur. They said they had nothing to eat except what the Muslim friends had sent to them. I know that the Meos are an easily excitable community and can create a lot of trouble. But the remedy does not lie in driving them out to Pakistan against their wishes. The real
 remedy lies in treating them as human beings and their weaknesses should be treated as any other illness.
 Then I went to the Jamia Millia. I had lent a  big hand  in building up that intitution. Dr. Zakir Husain is a dear friend of mine. He narrated his experiences with great anguish. But he had no bitterness in his heart. Recently he had to visit Jullunder. Had a Sikh Captain and a Hindu railway official not come to his help in time, the Sikhs in their mad fury would have killed him for being a Muslim. Dr. Zakir Husain thanked those people as he narrated his experiences to me. Just imagine, the national institution where many Hindus have been educated, is now afraid that angry refugees and the people who instigate them may attack it. I met the refugees who have been somehow accommodated in the compound of the Jamia Millia. When I heard their tragic tales I hung my head in shame. Then I went to the refugees camps at Diwan Hall, Wavell Canteen and Kingsway. I met the Sikh and Hindu refugees there. They had not yet forgotten my past services to the Punjab. But I noticed some angry faces in all those camps. Those people can be forgiven. they talked to me in sharp tones for being harsh to the Hindus. They said that I had not undergone the hardships that they did, and not lost my kith and kin. they said I had not been compelled to beg at every door. They asked me how I could comfort them by saying that I had been staying at Delhi to do my utmost to establish peace in the capital of the country. True I cannot bring back the dead. But death is a gift of God to all living things — human beings, animals. The difference is only of time and manner. Hence right conduct is the royal path to be followed, which makes life beautiful and worth living. Today a Sikh friend told me that he is a Sikh by birth but could not claim to be a true Sikh in the light of the Granth Saheb. I asked him if he knew any true Sikh. He could not point out even one. Then I politely told him that I claimed to be such  a Sikh. I said I was trying to live like a true Sikh according to the Granth Saheb. There was a time when in Nankana Saheb I was described as a true friend of the Sikhs. Guru Nanak made no distinction between Hindus and Muslims. For him the whole world was one. Such is also my sanatana dharma. Being a true Hindu I also claim to be a true Muslim. I always recite the great Muslim prayer in which it is proclaimed that God is one and He protects the whole world by day
 and night.
 I would like to tell the refugees that they should live truthfully and without fear. They should not entertain any thoughts of revenge or hatred. They should not act rashly out of anger and impulse and thus throw away the golden apple of freedom won at a great cost.

   TAKE CARE  
 Unless the Governments and their Secretariats take care, the English language is likely to usurp the place of Hindustani. This must do infinite harm to the millions of India who would never be able to understand English. Surely, it must be quite easy for the provincial Governments to have a staff which would carry on all transactions in the provincial languages and the interprovincial language, which, in my opinion, can only be Hindustani written in Nagari or Urdu script.
 Every day lost in making this necessary change is so much cultural loss to the nation. The first and foremost thing is to revive the rich provincial languages with which India is blessed. It is nothing short of mental sluggishness to plead that in our courts, in our schools and even in the secretariats, some time, probably a few years, must lapse before the change is made. No doubt a little difficulty will be felt in multi-lingual provinces, as in Bombay and Madras, until redistribution of provinces takes place on a linguistic basis. Provincial Governments can devise a method in order to enable the people in those provinces to feel that they have come into their own. Nor need the provinces wait for the Union for solving the question, whether for interprovincial speech it shall be Hindustani written in either Nagari or Urdu script or mere Hindi written in Nagari. This should not detain them in making the desired reforms. It is a wholly unnecessary controversy likely to be the door through which English may enter to the eternal disgrace of India. If the first step, that is, revival of provincial speech in all public departments, takes place immediately, that of inter-provincial speech will follow in quick succession. The provinces will have to deal with the Centre. They dare not do so through English, if the Centre is wise enough quickly to realize that they must not tax the nation culturally for the sake of a handful of
 Indians who are too lazy to pick up the speech which can be easily common to the whole of India without offending any party or section. My plea is for banishing English as a cultural usurper as we successfully banished the political rule of the English usurper. The rich English language will ever retain its natural place as the international speech of commerce and diplomacy.

 But I do not see religion anywhere in evidence today. And if it is a religious symbol, the restriction as regards its size should not matter.
 Gandhiji told them that it was wholly irrelevant and even improper to cite legal precedents to break healthy restraints under which alone society could grow in a state of liberty. The kirpan, which the Sikh religion enjoined upon its votaries, was a symbol of purity and self-restraint. It was a weapon for the defence of innocent women and children and old or disabled persons against tyranny in the face of overwhelming odds; never a weapon of offence or to be used in retaliation against defenceless women and children. Even during the war against the Muslims, the code was to tend the wounded on both sides. The kirpan had of late been used for totally indefensible purposes and he who used it wrongly forfeited the right to carry it.

    STATEMENT TOTHE PRESS        NEW 	DELHI, 
  September 	11, 1947  	During the day, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur took me and Dr. Sushila Nayyar 	to the Irwin Hospital which devotes its energies only to the 	treatment of injured persons, irrespective of caste or creed. Among 	the patients was a child, hardly five years old, who had received a 	bullet wound. The doctors and nurses were working under great 	stress. The majority of patients were Muslims, as the Hindus and 	Sikhs were transferred to other hospitals.  	I understand from Rajkumari that it was well-nigh impossible to 	supply refugee camps with Bhangis for attending to the cleaning of 	the latrines and general sanitation. Any infectious disease like 	cholera might break out. I have no doubt whatsoever that the 	refugees should look after sanitation, including latrine cleaning in 	their own camps and should do some useful work with the approval of 	the camp superintendent. There can be no exception to this rule, 	save for persons who are incapable of physical exertion. All camps 	should be models of cleanliness, simplicity and industry.  	During the day I had a visit from the Pakistan High Commissioner, 	who is an enthusiastic believer in communal peace and friendship. I 	had a visit too from Sikh friendslibtech_584_footnotelibtech_585_footnotetwice 	during the day. They were sore about the kirpan order of the 	Government of India. They have promised to give me their requirement 	in writing before I speak to the Government. They further said that 	allegations made against them were highly coloured. They said they 	could have no quarrel with the Muslims or any other communities 	living in the  Union. they were anxious to be law-abiding citizens 	of the State.  Harijan, 	21-9-1947            
  
    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        NEW 	DELHI, 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  September 	12, 1947 
  	The very first thing I want to tell you is that I have received 	disturbing newslibtech_586_footnotefrom 	the Frontier Province.  I am, of course deeply pained to hear it. I 	have spent considerable time in the Frontier Province. Badshah Khan 	was with me. I stayed with Dr. Khan Saheb. I used to have friendly 	meetings with members of the Muslim League. And now I am amazed that 	the Hindus and Sikhs cannot live there in peace. There used to be a 	considerable population of Hindus and Sikhs there but their number 	was small compared to that of the Muslims. However, it is not the 	number that matters. Even an innocent child should be able to live 	there in safety.  	What I think to myself I may as well convey to you, that is, we 	should not get angry. We can, of course, feel the the pain. We ought 	to feel sympathy and concern for our brothers who are in trouble. It 	is natural to feel, ‘why not kill the Muslims because our brothers 	have been killed.’ But I for one cannot kill even the actual 	murderers of my brothers. Should I then prepare myself to kill other 	innocent people? I do not believe in meeting evil with evil. He who 	indulges in evil words and deeds turns brutal; he becomes senseless. 	Let me narrate an incident of my childhood days. I think I was about 	ten years at that time. My elder brother had fallen ill. He had 	almost become mad. But everyone took pity on him. We sent for 	several doctors but not for a jailor, and we did not send him to 	jail. We did not send for soldiers because he had gone mad. My 	father was in  a position to do anything he wanted to do. But why 	did he refrain from doing any such thing? After all he was his son. 	And how could my father kill his own son? So all these people are 	like my own sons, like my own brothers. I would like to request you 	not to regard  the Muslims as your enemies. I can point out any 	number of Muslims who are my friends. Just because the country has 	been divided into India and Pakistan, it does not befit us to 	slaughter the Muslims who have    
 stayed behind. The Government of Pakistan has forgotten its duty. I shall appeal to the Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah who is the Governor-General of Pakistan to desist from such policies. If the Press reports are correct, I would tell him that the Hindus and Sikhs have remained in Pakistan to serve him. Why are the Hindus and the Sikhs scared now? Because they are afraid that they and their wives would have to die and that their wives would be abducted. They are in danger and so they are fleeing. Why is it so under that Government? I want to tell my people that they should not become so barbaric. If the Hindus and the Sikhs say that they would take revenge on the local Muslims because the Hindus and the Sikhs in Pakistan are in trouble, they have been destroyed there and have fled leaving their property worth millions, it will be sheer bar-barism. I have seen the terrible plight of the Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan. I have lived in Lahore. Do you think I am not pained? I claim that my pain is no less than that of any Punjabi. If any Hindu or Sikh from the Punjab comes and tells me that his anguish is greater than mine because he has lost his brother or daughter or father, I would say that his brother is my brother, his mother is my mother, and I have the same anguish in my heart as he has. I am also a human being and feel enraged but I swallow my anger. That gives me strength. What revenge can I take with that strength? How should I take revenge so that they feel repentant for their crimes and admit that they have committed grave crimes? You all know what the Muslims have done in West Punjab. What can we do if Muslims are destroying religion? What are we going to do about it? Should I say that the Hindus and Sikhs of Delhi and those who have come from outside should become barbarians because Muslims are becoming  barbarians?
 I had gone to the Jama Masjid today. I met the residents of that area. I also met their womenfolk. Some of the women wept before me and some brought their children to indicate their sad plight. Should I narrate to them the plight of the Hindus and Sikhs in West Punjab and in the Frontier Province? Will it mitigate the sorrow of the Hindus and Sikhs of the Punjab in any way? The people of Pakistan resorted to ways of barbarism, and so did the Hindus and Sikhs. And so, how could one barbarian find fault with another barbarian? That is why I would like to appeal to all of you to save Hinduism and Sikhism, save India and Pakistan and thus save the whole country. If we remain good to the end, the Muslims of Pakistan would have to be good too. That is the law of the world. No one can change it. This old man, who had   made   a   considerable   study   of   religion   and   tried   to serve
 
 everybody, is telling you this. I have had enough experience in my 78-79 years. I have stayed outside India for twenty years. I lived in South Africa, the land of the Negroes, but never gave up Ramanama. I can say in the light of my own experience that it is not for us to avenge anybody’s wrongs. He who does good to one who has been good to him is a mere Bania and a pseudo-Bania at that. I say that I am a Bania myself; and I am a true Bania. May you not become pseudo-Banias. True human being is he who does a good turn for evil.  I learnt this in my childhood. I still believe in the rightness of this. I would like you to return evil with good.
 Those people were lying in the mosque in a sad state. They did not gather in such large numbers on Friday for fun. They had heard that I had done something for the Muslims in Calcutta and Bihar and something for the Hindus in Noakhali. They thought it was good that  I had gone to meet them. They wanted to know what I could do for them as one who called himself a sanatani Hindu and on that account claimed to be a Muslim, Sikh, Parsi and Christian. A mother said her child was dead and she did not know what to do. I told her: “What can  I tell you, dear lady? Think of God. He would be kind to you. What if your child is dead? What if everybody is dead? You would be going that way yourself—if not by knife, may be of cholera. You are not going to live forever, are you? Hence, think of God. What are you going to gain by crying over it?’
 Let us know our own dharma. In the light of our dharma I would tell the people that our our greatest duty is to see that the Hindus do not act in frenzy, nor the Sikhs indulge in acts of madness. I wish to tell you that all those Muslims who have left their places should be sent back. I do not have the courage to send them back right now. But we must keep it in mind that they have got to be sent back. Till the Muslims are able to return to the places from which they have fled, we cannot have peace of mind. There is of course one point to consider. Today people tell me that the Muslims keep arms in their houses, they keep ammunition, machine-guns, and sten-guns which I have not even seen. For instance, this is the case in Subzi Mandi. I am prepared to believe everything. But why should we be afraid of this? I would tell the Muslims and I am telling everybody in Delhi that they should declare with God as witness, that there is no reason for them to be killed for the crimes committed in Pakistan. We are your friends and we all belong and shall ever belong to India. Delhi is no small place. It is the capital of the country. Here we have the grand Jama Masjid and
 also the fort. You have not built these nor have I built them. They have been built by the Mughals who ruled over us. They had become part of India. By telling the Muslims today to leave the country do you mean to say that you going to take possession of the Jama Masjid? And if that is your intention, do you know the implication? Just think about it. Are we going to stay in the Jama Masjid? I cannot agree to any such proposal. The Muslims must have the right to visit that place. It belongs to them. We are also proud of it. It is full of great artistic beauty. Shall we raze it to the ground? That can never be.
 I appeal to the Muslims that they should open-heartedly declare that they belong to India and are loyal to the Union. If they are true to God and wish to live in the Indian Union, they just cannot be enemies of the Hindus. And I want the Muslims here to tell the Muslims in Pakistan who have become the enemies of the Hindus, not to go mad: ‘If you are going to indulge in such madness, we cannot co-operate with you. We will remain faithful to the Union, and salute the tricolour. We have to follow the order of the Government.’ These Muslims themselves should tell all the other Muslims to surrender all their  arms. It is the duty of the Government not to punish anyone for having possessed the arms. This is exactly what I did in Calcutta. People surrendered big stock of arms to me there. Most of these people were Hindus. Here if the Muslims possess arms, do the Hindus not possess anything? I am telling the Hindus that they should not possess any arms at all. If they wish to possess arms they should get the licence. It is said that in the Punjab everybody has been given the right to possess arms. It is not going to do any good to the Punjab. If everybody possesses arms, people will fight among themselves and kill each other. The Government needs arms, what has the citizen got to do with them? None of the city people should possess arms. I would like the Muslims to surrender all the arms in their possession to the Government. The Hindus too should surrender all their arms. There should be no mutual fear. We should tell them that whatever happens outside, we in Delhi would live like brothers. The same thing happened in Calcutta and the Hindus and the Muslims have started living like brothers. The Hindus in Bihar have adopted the same attitude.You must soon create such a situation in Delhi that I can immediately go to the Punjab and tell the people there  that  the Muslims of Delhi are living in peace. I would ask for its reward there. I would ask for that reward from the Nawab of Mamdot. I would go to East Punjab as well. Since I belong to all religions I have a right and
 would say to all that they should not give in to madness.
 The Muslims wanted Pakistan and they have got it. Why are they fighting now and with whom are they fighting? Because they have taken Pakistan, do they want the whole of India too? That will never happen. Why are they killing the weak Hindus and the Sikhs? I want to tell them all these things. I am alone. You have got the whole Government. Let both the Governments come to a mutual agreement that they have protect the minorities in their respective countries. We have to protect the minority here. Otherwise how can Jawaharlal and Sardar Patel say that they are protecting the minorities and there is no Muslim child anyone can harm or frighten by his blood-shot eyes? If there is any Muslim who has gone mad and who secretly keeps machine-guns in his house, we would punish him. But no one can touch the Muslims who are loyal to the country. You must create such conditions here so that Jawaharlal and Sardar Patel should be able to say Delhi had lost its senses for a few days but now it has become sane.
 I would like to tell my Muslim friends that they must issue a proper statement. They must thoroughly cleanse their hearts.  The  Sikhs have issued some statement. So have the Hindus. If the minds and hearts are purified we can live together in amity. After all, so much of business of Delhi, such wonderful buildings this culture of Delhi belong to both the Hindus and the Muslims and not exclusively to either.libtech_587_footnote
 In conclusion, Gandhiji referred to his and Dr. Dinshaw Mehta’s talk with the Gurulibtech_588_footnoteof the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. He [Gandhiji] had been told that the hands of this organization too were steeped in blood. The Guruji assured him that this was untrue. Their organization was enemy to no man. It did not stand for the killing of Muslims. All it wanted to do was to protect Hindustan to the best of its ability. It stood for peace and he had asked Gandhiji to make his views public.libtech_589_footnote

   MY STATUElibtech_590_footnote  
 There is a talk in Bombay of spending ten lacs of rupees on erecting my statue on a public site. I have received several letters criticizing, some even firecely, the proposal as if I were guilty of making any such extravagant proposal! It is perhaps human nature to make a mountain out of a mole hill. Only the wise sift the grain from the chaff. In the present case there seems to be a foundation for the criticism. I must say that I have dislike even for being photographed; nevertheless, photographs have been taken of me. I have let artists make models more than once. Notwithstanding this inconsistency, I must dissent emphatically from any proposal to spend any money on preparing a statue of me, more especially at a time when people do not have enough food and clothing. In Bombay the beautiful, insanitation reigns. There is so much overcrowding that poor people ae packed like sardines. Wise use of ten lacs of rupees will consist in its being spent on some public utility. That would be the best statue. Money thus wisely spent will make an adequate return. Imagine how many hungry mouths would be filled if the amount was spent on growing more food crops!

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 
 
 NEW DELHI,
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  September 	13, 1947 
  	Long ago, perhaps in 1915, when I came to Delhi I had met Hakim 	Saheblibtech_591_footnotelibtech_592_footnoteand Dr. Ansari. I was told that Delhi was ruled not by 	the British but by Hakim Saheb. Dr. Ansari was as an elderly man and 	a great surgeon and physician. He also knew Hakim Saheb and greatly 	respected him. Hakim Saheb was also a Muslim and a very great 	scholar and Hakim. He was a Unani Hakim but had made considerable 	study of the Ayurvedic system. Thousands of Muslims and thousands of 	poor Hindus used to come to him for treatment. Well-to-do Muslims 	and Hindus also came to him. They used to give a thousand rupees per 	day. As far as I knew Hakim Saheb, he did not care for the money. 	His interest was the service of everybody who was in need of it. And 	he was like a king. His forefathers lived in China. They were 	Muslims of China and were thorough gentlemen. I enquired of all the 	Hindus who came to visit me as to who was their leader in the city. 	[Was it] Shraddhanandjilibtech_593_footnotelibtech_594_footnote? Shraddhanandji used to work a lot among them. But no, 	their leader was Hakim Saheb. Why? Because he had served both the 	Hindus and the Muslims. Well, I have referred to the situation as it 	was in 1915. But later on my relations with him grew closer and I 	came to know him more intimately. I also came to know Dr. Ansari 	better. I stayed with Dr. Ansari for a long time. I know his 	daughter Zohra and his son-in-law Shaukat Khanlibtech_595_footnotelibtech_596_footnote. They are all nice people and are still here in Delhi. 	But what pains me is that they are now scared that some Hindu might 	kill them as well. They are not staying in their own house. They 	have gone to live in a hotel. It was sheer coincidence that they 	were spared. Their watchman was a Hindu. He drove away the rioters. 	Why should the Hindus and the Sikhs get into such frenzy that the 	Muslims are scared? You can turn round and tell me, many Hindus tell 	me in anger fixing their blood-shot eyes on me: ‘You were away in 	Bengal and Bihar. Just come to the Punjab and see the plight of the 	Hidnus and the Sikhs and see the state of the girls        
 there.’ It is not as if I do not understand these things. But I want to keep both these things on the same level. Atrocities are committed there in any case. But if one of my brothers gets into a mad fury and starts killing people, should I also go mad with rage like him? How is it possible? I claim to be a true Hindu and a sanatani Hindu at that. That is exactly why I am also a Muslim, a Parsi, a Christian and a Jew. For me all these are the branches of the same tree. Which of these branches should I keep and which should I discard? From which branch should I pick the leaves and which should I ignore? For me all are the same. That is how I am made. How can I help it? There would be absolute peace if everybody starts thinking like me.
 I went to the Purana Quila today. I saw thousands of Muslims there. Other trucks loaded with Muslims were proceeding towards the Quila. All of them were Muslim refugees. Why did they have to live in the fort? Of whom were they frightened? Were they afraid of you, of me? I know that I do not frighten anyone, but my brothers, who consider themselves Hindus and Sikhs, are frightening them. But if they have frightened them it means that I have frightened them, you have frightenedthem. Thus I cannot bear to see them escaping to Pakistan out of panic. It is not as if there is heaven in Pakistan and hell here. Why do we find ourselves in such hell? I know that neither Pakistan nor India is hell. If we wish we can turn either into heaven or by our own deeds into hell. And if both the countries become hell, an independent man has no place there. After that we are only doomed to slavery. This thought is gnawing at my heart. My heart trembles and I wonder how I will make any Hindu, Sikh or Muslim understand all this. Quite a few Muslims in the fort were enraged, but others stopped them. There was love in their hearts. They persuaded their enraged brethren saying: ‘This old man has come to serve us, to wipe our tears. We are hungry and he has come to see if he can find bread for us somewhere. We are without any water, he has come to see if he can get us water from somewhere.’ I do not know whether they get food and water there. Some of them told me there was no food, no water for them. I had gone there to find out. Some of them talked to me with great affection. I felt happy. No one would ever want to leave behind his house and property. The Hindu refugees are in the same situation. They have left behind their homes and properties. Some of them died; this is not a happy situation. It is a matter of shame for everybody. I was trying to convince them also. Through you I want to speak to everyone who cares to listen to me. It is said that in the Mahabharata
 period the Pandavas used to stay in this Purana Quila. Whether you call it Indraprastha or Delhi, the Hindus and the Muslims have grown here together. It was the capital of the Mughals. Now it is the capital of India. There is no surviver of the Mughal dynasty. The Mughals came from outside. They identified themselves with the manners and customs of Delhi. From among them some happened to be Ansari Sahebs, Hakim Sahebs and some became Hindus too. The Hindus also joined their services. In such a Delhi of yours the Hindus and the Muslims used to live together peacefully. They did fight occasio- nally. But they would fight for a short while and then be united again. On one occasion, some fanatic made a murderous attack on Shraddhanandji. But earlier the Muslims with great affection, had  taken Shraddhanandji to Jama Masjid where he addressed them. This is your Delhi.
 But what is happening today? The Sardar always used to walk with his head high, but I tell you today he walks with his head bent. And Jawaharlal, that brave and courageous Jawaharlal who used to fly in the air, is today sitting helpless. Why has he become helpless? We have made him helpless. If there is one individual acting mad, he can be cured. But who would treat whom when all start behaving that way? Jawaharlal is no God after all. Nor is the Sardar any God. And their other Ministers have no divine powers either. Nor do they have any outside help.
 I am telling the same thing to everybody. Many Hindus and Muslims came to me. I have had many discussions with them. But ultimately my voice turns to God. I pray to Him that He should take me away from the world, or bring sanity to the people of Delhi. Let there be no angry thought for the Muslims in the heart of any Hindu or Sikh. People tell me that the Muslims are supposed to be Fifth Columnists, that is, they are traitors, disloyal to the present
 Government. 	There are 4libtech_597_footnote crore 	Muslims in India. If 4libtech_598_footnote crore 	people 
  	are traitors, who would be the loser? They themselves will be the  	losers. They would be burying Islam that way. But they cannot do 	harm to the Hindus and the Sikhs. But you should not harass those 4libtech_599_footnote 	crore Muslims. It is not proper to tell them that they should be 	either ready to die or go to Pakistan. Why should they go? And under 	whose protection? I tell you that they are under your protection, 	and under my protection. At least I am not prepared to see that 	sight. I would rather pray to God that He should take me away before 	that. He has 
 kept me alive long enough. A life of 78-79 years is not a short one. I am fully satisfied. I have served to the best of my capacity. If God wishes to keep me alive, let Him take from me the work that will satisfy my heart. Let both the communities tell me that I am their friend, that is why they listen to me and would continue to do so. I meet quite a few Muslims. How can I say they are traitors and are betraying me? I tell you that even if they are betraying, it is not going to help them in any way. I admit that the Muslims have lots of arms with them. I have taken some of their arms and some are still with them. But what would they do with the arms they have? Would they kill me? Would they kill you? If they do that the Government is there to look into it. I tell you that if we become good and behave well the Government will see that justice is done to us. Let the Governments fight each other; but we would not quarrel among  ourselves.  We would remain friends. Let us not be afraid that they would kill us. However powerful the person who wants to kill us is, he cannot kill us so long as God protects us. That is why I am telling both the Hindus and the Muslims that they should abandon fear. I did not like the statement made by the Qaid-e-Azam. He says that the Muslims are being taken to Pakistan because they have been harassed in the Indian Union. He says there should be food for them and land to settle them. Pakistan, he says, is a poor country, and so, those who have money should send it there.libtech_600_footnotelibtech_601_footnoteI have nothing to complain about it. But along with that, why does he not mention what happened to the Hindus in West Punjab? If Bihar indulged in evil acts they repented it. In Calcutta the Hindus came to me and repented before me. It would be a noble thing if the Muslims do the same and admit that they have done wrong things. I have seen the things and how can I close my eyes to them? Nor can I cover up the crimes committed by the Hindus. I want to be faithful to all religions. I can betray neither God nor men. I wish to be loyal to all.
 I said yesterdaylibtech_602_footnotelibtech_603_footnotethat it is the duty of the Muslims that leading men among them should proclaim that not all are so worthless. They should say that they are and will remain loyal to India, and will fight the whole world for the sake of India. Then only are  they  true Muslims.  If they do not do this they become bad Muslims.  It  is my
 
 
 hope that in India we do not have such bad Muslims. And if there are, in order to make them good we have to be good ourselves, not bad.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       NEW 	DELHI, 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  September 	14, 1947 
  	Just as I did yesterday, today also I went to see our Muslim 	refugees. I have not seen anywhere the like of the squalor I found 	in that camp. I went to the camps of the Hindus as well as to those 	of the Muslims. The camp for the Hindu [refugees] is at a different 	place. There is so much stench in the Muslim camps; I wonder why 	they are not cleaning the place. If I were to be in charge of the 	camp, I would never tolerate this. I have lived in camps and I have 	seen many camps. Our camps should not be kept so dirty. I was very 	much pained. There is so much police and military arrangement and 	why do they tolerate such stink and stench? They would say cleaning 	the place is not their job, and that they have only orders to shoot, 	if necessary and to maintain peace and order in the camps. They say 	that if the refugees quarrel among themselves, they brush them away 	with their guns. They have orders only to do this much and they 	cannot go beyond what they have been ordered to do. That is all 	right. But they are now our soldiers and our police. In my view they 	must have a pickaxe and also a spade. They must clear the dirt 	wherever they find it. Their primary function should be to keep the 	places clean. To keep the camps in good condition both the Hindu and 	Muslim friends themselves have to clean them. We become their 	enemies if we do not tell them this. If we are their friends and 	servants we must make it plain to them that because they have come 	here, they should not live like helpless creatures. If Hindu 	refugees come from Pakistan should we push them into wells? Should 	we not keep them here and look after them? We must tell them that we 	would give them food and water but not sweepers. I am a very 	hard-hearted man.  	I had worked with pickaxe during the Kumbh Mela at Hardwar. We used 	to be in charge of all the jobs concerning the camp sanitation. 	Everybody was trained for that type of work. So I would 
 say that whoever may be in charge of these camps, I am not bothered if he is a Muslim or a Hindu, his first and foremost job is to keep his camp absolutely clean. This involves no expenditure. If there are no shovels in the camps, it is the duty of the Government to provide them. If the Government does not provide them with shovels, if it is so busy that it has no time to spare, then the camp commander has to provide the shovels. Just as it is the duty of the Government to reach food to the camps, it is also its duty to make arrangements for sanitation, drinking water and water for washing purposes. Because there is no proper sewage arrangement, cholera spreads. Camp sanitation should never be imperfect. I must admit that I have learnt this thing from the British. I did not know how camp sanitation had to be looked after. I did not know how thousands and millions lived together and how they could be entrusted with jobs so that they would work for sanitation, or any work they may be asked to do. Militarypeople are able to do all this. In minutes a whole city comes up and tents are put up. The first job in the camp is that the party which reaches there first must find out the water arrangements and see how water is to be used. The next party has to dig the trenches, so that urine and the latrine dirt do not flow out. With such an arrangement there can be no cholera and dysentry. People can all stay with ease. I want to leave out other things.
 Here people are living in chaos. They are all lying helterskelter. Nobody bothers to keep the camp clean. Whom can I blame? The commander of the Muslim camp is a Muslim. He can tell his people and make them understand what they should do. He has to be persuasive. They must be told that they would all die if they continued to live in filth, that their children can’t remain unclean. So it is much better that they keep the camp clean. We can do a lot there if we train those people in sanitation. If you see the camp of the Hindus, you will find filth there too. But there is still some difference. I can never walk barefoot in that place. There was no water at all in the lake. It was absolutely dry. There was no sewage arrangement. After all, neither the Muslims nor the Hindus are animals. But today we have turned into beasts. Why did the Hindus and the Sikhs flee from Pakistan in panic? Even if the Hindus have behaved very badly here, they have not done anything there. If there is anyone who has committed a crime, let him be punished. That is the responsibility of the Government. Similarly I would ask why should anyone have to run away from here? If they are Muslims, are they to be blamed for being
 
 Muslims? Even the Muslims belong to us and are under our Government. If they are refugees, it is very clear that is is a matter of shame for Delhi. The Muslims who are here have not come from outside. Almost all of them have come from different localities of Delhi. A few of them may have come from outside. We have driven them out of Delhi. Let me tell you as I told you yesterday that it is a matter of great shame for us. It is failure of the Government  of Pakistan that the minorities has to run away from there. It must tell those people that they have got to stay in Pakistan. But today the situation in Pakistan is such that even good people are running away. Lahore is almost empty. It is the city built up by the Hindus where I saw the big mansions of the Hindus and so many educational institutions—where else do you find so many colleges? I always appreciate every good thing. Today who is in possession of those colleges? All this hurts me. And I feel ashamed that the Government of Pakistan can be so mean. And then I feel all the more ashamed when I see the situation here. How can the situation go wrong in Delhi in spite of our Government, in spite of Jawaharlal who is like a lion and with a Home Minister like Sardar Patel? Why should his authority not be accepted? If he sends out an order that a child has to be protected here, that child must be protected. We could then carry on our Government. But now he has military and police through which he is trying to establish peace. But whose Government is it after all? It is your own Government. You have made it.
 If everyone would abide by the authority of his own Government, everything can be done. Otherwise the world will ridicule Delhi for its present state of affairs. And then the European powers, be it Russia, France or Britain, as well as America will laugh at us and say that we are not capable of preserving our freedom. We are only  capable of being slaves. This should not happen. That is why I would like to tell the Muslims that they should surrender all their arms of their own accord. They should surrender their arms not out of fear, but because they are living in India. They should do this if they want to live like brothers. Then they should prove their loyalty to India and show that they can never betray the country. Whether Hindus or Muslims, all of them belong to India. I also want to tell the Muslims that if the Muslims in West Punjab, the Frontier Province, Baluchistan and Sind go crazy and the Hindus and the Sikhs cannot live in peace there, then the situation becomes difficult for us here. After all, we are all human beings. So let them understand humanity. How long can we
 go on persuading? Man can go crazy and he can also be good. Let him stay here peacefully if he can live properly. If there is some man who goes so crazy that he becomes a brute, then I would tell the Hindus of Delhi that they should be on their guard and be brave, not cowards. It is cowardice to be frightened by the arms the Muslims may be having in their possession. What do we care if there are some Muslims somewhere having arms with them? It is the duty of the Government to disarm them. It is the duty of the military to deprive them of their arms. If they want to be good and truly belong to India and want to live with the Hindus in amity, let them surrender their arms. And let the Muslims admit their mistakes. Let them say that they had wished to conquer Delhi and turn the whole of India into Pakistan but now they have realized that it is not possible to turn India into Pakistan. They must be content that they are already having Pakistan. They must say that they can save the Hindus in Pakistan and keep them happy. Then it would so happen that both India and Pakistan would compete with each other in being good and more sincere in their humanity. Whether we look towards Mecca or towards the East, truthfulness lies in our own hearts, and what matters is that our hearts should be clean. If we compete with each other in being good, we can all rise high and work together.
 I told you that since I had come here I would also wish to die here. If we go on indulging in acts of frenzy and become overcome by rage and kill the Muslims, I can have nothing to do with it. I do not wish to be a witness to such a thing. If the Muslims think that the Hindus and the Sikhs are at fault and the Hindus and the Sikhs think that the Muslims are at fault, they are both wrong. They are all the same to me. In my eyes the Hindus and the Muslims are all one. Only the true among them are recognized by God. Who are you to punish the wicked for their wrong deeds ? They are going to be punished themselves. I have no doubt about it. This is the essence I have drawn from all religions. That is why I would say that whatever wrong the Muslims may do , you have got to be good. If your really want to avenge the evil deeds it can only be through the deeds of goodness. I want to see that at least you do it. If we do this much, we can deep our own Government in India in good shape. If not, we are going to lose everything.

 DEAR RAMASWAMI,

Yes, I remember you very well.
       From 	a copy: C. W. 10580. Courtesy: Gorur Ramaswami Iyengar      SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_606_footnote    Yours,  BAPU         NEW DELHI, 
  September 15, 1947 During 	the night as I heard what should have been the soothing sound of 	gentle life-giving rain, my mind went out to the thousands of refugees 	lying about in the open camps at Delhi. I was sleeping snugly  	in a verandah protecting me on all sides. But for the cruel hand of 	man against his brother, these thousands of men, women and children 	would not be shelterless and in many cases foodless. In some places 	they could not but be in knee-deep water. They have no other 	choice.libtech_607_footnoteWas 	it all inevitable? The answer from within was an emphatic ‘No.’ 	Was this the first fruit of freedom, just a month-old baby? These 	thoughts have haunted me throughout these last twenty hours. My 	silence has been a blessing. It has made me enquire within. Have the 	citizens of Delhi gone mad? Have they no humanity left in them? Have 	love of the country and its freedom no appeal for them? I must be  	pardoned for putting the blame first on  the  Hindus  and  Sikhs.       
 Could they not be men enough to stem the tide of hatred? I would urge the Muslims of Delhi to shed all fear, trust God and disclose all the arms in their possession which the Hindus and the Sikhs fear they have. Not that the former too do not have any. The question is one of degree.  Some may have more, some less.libtech_608_footnoteEither the  minority  rely upon God and His creature man to do the right thing or rely upon their fire-arms to defend themselves against those whom they must not trust.
 My advice is precise and firm. Its soundness is manifest. Trust your Government to defend every citizen against wrongdoers, however well-armed they may be. Further trust it to demand and get damages for every member of the minority wrongfully dispossessed. All that neither Government can do is to resurrect the dead.  The people of Delhi will make it difficult to demand justice from the Pakistan Government. Those who seek justice must do justice, must have clean hands. Let the Hindus and the Sikhs take the right step and invite the Muslims who have been driven out of their homes to return. If they can take this courageous step, worthy from every point of view, they immediately reduce the refugee problem to its simplest terms. They will command recognition from Pakistan, nay from the whole world. They will save Delhi and India from disgrace and ruin. For me, transfer of millions of the Hindus and the Sikhs and the Muslims is unthinkable. It is wrong. The wrong of Pakistan will be undone by the right of a resolute non-transfer of population. I hope I shall have the courage to stand by it, even though mine may be the solitary voice in its favour.

    SPEECH AT R. S. 			S. RALLYlibtech_614_footnote       NEW 	DELHI, 
  September 	16, 1947  Gandhiji 	said that he 	had visited 	the Rashtriya 	Swayamsevak Sangh camp 	years ago 	at Wardha, 	when the founder 	Shri Hedgewar was 	alive. The 	late Shri Jamnalal Bajaj 	had taken 	him to 	the camp and he 	(Gandhiji) had 	been very well impressed 	by their 	discipline, complete 	absence of untouchability 	and rigorous 	simplicity. Since 	then the Sangh 	had grown. 	Gandhiji was convinced 	that any 	organization which was 	inspired by 	the ideal 	of service 	and self-sacrifice 	was bound 	 to grow 	in strength. 	But in 	order to 	be truly useful, 	self-sacrifice had to 	be combined with 	purity of motive 	and true 	knowledge. Sacrifice 	without these two 	had been known 	to prove 	ruinous to society.  The 	prayer that was 	recited at 	the beginning 	was in 	praise of 	Mother India, 	Hindu culture and Hindu 	religion. He claimed to be a sanatani 	Hindu. He 	took the root 	meaning of the word 	sanatana. 	No one knew 	accurately the origin 	of the 	word Hindu. 	The name was 	given to 	us and we 	had characteristically 	adopted it. Hinduism 	had absorbed 	the best 	of all 	the faiths of 	the world 	and in 	that sense it 	was not 	an exclusive 	religion. Hence it 	could have 	no quarrel 	with Islam 	or its 	followers as 	unfortunately was 	the case today. When 	the poison of 	untouchability entered 	Hinduism, the 	decline began. One 	thing was 	certain, and 	he had 	been proclaiming it 	from house-tops, that 	if untouchability 	lived, Hinduism 	must die. Similarly, 	if the 	Hindus felt 	that in India 	there was no 	place for 	anyone else 	except the 	Hindus and 	if non-Hindus, 	especially Muslims, wished to 	live here, they had 	to live 	as the 	slaves of 	the Hindus, 	they would kill Hinduism. Similarly if 	Pakistan believed that in 	Pakistan only 	the Muslims had 	a rightful 	place and the non-Muslims 	had to 	live there 	on sufferance and as their slaves, it would be the death-knell of Islam in India.  It 	was an unfortunate fact that India had been divided into two parts. 	If one part went mad and did ugly deeds, was the other part to 	follow suit? There was no gain in returning evil for evil. Religion 	taught us to return good for evil.  He 	had seen their Guruji a few days ago. He had mentioned to him the 	various complaints about the Sangh that he had received in Calcutta 	and Delhi. The Guruji had assured him that though he could not 	vouch- safe for the correct behaviour of every member of the Sangh, 	the policy of the Sangh was purely service of the Hindus and 	Hinduism and that too not at the cost of anyone else. The Sangh did 	not believe in      
 aggression. It did not believe in ahimsa. It taught the art of self-defence. It never taught retaliation.libtech_615_footnote
 Today the ship of India was passing through troubled waters. The leaders in charge of the Government were the best that India possessed. Some people were dissatisfied with them. He would ask them to produce better men if they could and he would advise the old guards to hand over the reins to their betters. After all the Sardar was an old man and Pandit Jawaharlal, though not old in years, looked old and haggard under the burden he was carrying. They were doing their utmost to serve the people, but they could only act according to their lights. If the vast bulk of the Hindus wanted to go in a particular direction, even though it might be wrong, no one could prevent them from doing so. But even a single individual had the right to raise his voice against it and give them the warning. That is what Gandhiji was doing. He was told that he was the friend of the Muslims and the enemy of the Hindus and the Sikhs. It was true that he was a friend of the Muslims, as he was of the Parsis and others. In this respect he was the same today as he had been since the age of twelve. But those who called him the enemy of the Hindus and the Sikhs did not know him. He could be enemy of none, much less of the Hindus and Sikhs.
 If Pakistan persisted in wrongdoing, there was bound to be war between India and Pakistan. If he had his way, he would have no military; not even police. But all this was tall talk. He was not the Government. Why did not Pakistan plead with the Hindus and the Sikhs and ask them not to leave their homes and ensure their safety in every way? Why could not they in the Indian Union ensure the safety of every Muslim? Today both the parties appeared to have gone crazy. The result could be nothing but destruction and misery.
 The Sangh was a well-organized, well-disciplined body. Its strength could be used in the interest of India or against it. He did not know whether there was any truth in the allegations made against the Sangh. It was for the Sangh to show by their uniform behaviour that the allegations were baseless.
 At the conclusion of the speech, Gandhiji invited questions. One person asked if Hinduism permitted killing of an evil-doer.libtech_616_footnoteIf not how did he explain the exhortation by Lord Krishna in the second chapter of the Gita to  destroy  the Kauravas.
 The reply to the first question, said Gandhiji, was both yes and no. One had to be an infallible judge as to who was the evil-doer before the question of killing could arise. In other words one had to be completely faultless before such a right could accrue to one. How could a sinner claim the right to judge or execute another sinner?
 
 
 As for the second question, granting that the right to punish the evildoer was recognized by the Gita, it could be exercised by the properly constituted Government only.
Both the Sardar and Pandit Nehru will be rendered powerless if
 you become judge and executioner in one. They are tried servants of the nation. Give them a chance to serve you. Do not sabotage their efforts by taking the law into your own hands.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       NEW 	DELHI, 
  September 	17, 1947  	After my experience of last eveninglibtech_618_footnotelibtech_619_footnoteI 	have decided not to hold the prayers till every man present in the 	audience is ready for it. I have never imposed anything on anybody, 	then how can I impose a highly spiritual thing like prayer? The 	prompting to pray or not to pray should come from within. There is 	no question at all of pleasing me.     
 My prayer meetings have become really popular. It appears that millions of people have been benefited from these meetings. But in these times of mutual tension I very well understand the anger of the people who have undergone great hardships. My only condition for holding the prayer is that I should not be expected to omit that particular portion to which there may be some objection. Either the prayer should be heartily accepted as a whole or it should be rejected. For me the recitation from the Koran is that part of the prayer which cannot be discontinued.
 I can understand your  resentment and the impatience it generates. But if you wish to qualify yourselves to deserve your freedom, you will have to curb your anger and will have to depend on your Government to get the fullest justice done to you. I am not proposing to you my method of non-violence, much as I would like to, for I know that today no one is going to listen to my talk about non-violence. That is why I have suggested that you should adopt the ways followed by all democratic countries. In democracy, every individual has to abide by the wishes of the people, that is, the Government, and has to direct his own wishes in that light. If every man takes the law into his own hands the State cannot function. It would mean anarchy, which means end of social order. That is, the State would not exist. That is the way to lose our independence. I believe that if you would let the Government carry out its tasks, there is no doubt that every Hindu and Sikh refugee would return home with honour and respect. But you cannot expect these things  to happen if you want your Muslim compatriots to be driven out of India. I find any such thing dreadful. You cannot secure justice by doing injustice to the Muslims. Apart from that, if it is true that the minorities, that is, the Hindus and the Sikhs have been treated very badly in Pakistan, it is also true that in East Punjab the monority people, that is the Muslims, have been badly treated. For both the countries the right way to arrive at a proper agreement is that both sides should acknowledge their mistakes with clean hearts and arrive at  a mutual settlement. If it is not possible to come to a settlement they must resort to arbitration and accept the arbitrator’s decision. Another way is the uncivilized way of war. I hate the very idea of war. But there would be no alternative to war in the absence of mutual settlement or decision by an arbitrator. I therefore hope that in such circumstances people will give up their madness and come to their senses and reassure
 their Muslim neighbours who have chosen not to go to Pakistan, and persuade them to return to their hearths by promising safety and protection to them. This thing cannot be accomplished with the help of the army. It can be achieved only when people come  to  their senses. I have decided not to live to witness the country being ruined by fratricide. I am constantly praying to God that. He should take me away before any calamity befalls this sacred and beautiful land of ours. I request you all to join me in this prayer.
 I am grateful to the Hindu and Muslim workerslibtech_620_footnotelibtech_621_footnotefor working together in amity. If you would work with perfect unity, you would provide a worthy example to the country. The working class should not allow communalism to come anywhere near them. Have I not said that if only you knew your own power and continued to do constructive work with understanding, you would become true owners and rulers and your employers would be your trustees and friends to help you in the times of difficulty? That happy moment can come only when they realize that rather than gold and silver which only the workers bring out from the earth, the workers themselves are the true wealth.

    SPEECH TOMUSLIMSlibtech_622_footnote        NEW 	DELHI, 
  September 	18, 1947  Addressing 	them Gandhiji said that they had to be brave and declare firmly that 	they would not leave their homes whatever might happen. They should 	look to none but God for their safety and protection. He was there 	to do whatever he could. He had pledged himself to do or die in 	Noakhali, Bihar, Calcutta and now in Delhi. He would not ask those 	who had left their homes to come back till there was real peace and 	the Hindus, the Sikhs and the Muslims agreed to live as brothers 	without the help of the police and the military.  He 	was the friend 	and servant 	of the 	Muslims as 	of the Hindus 	and others. 	He would 	not rest 	till every Muslim in the 	Union, who 	wished to 	live as 	a loyal citizen of 	the Union, 	was back 	in his 	home living in 	peace and 	security and 	the Hindus and 	the Sikhs 	returned likewise to 	their homes. He 	had served 	the Muslims 	for a 	long time in 	South Africa and 	in India. 	He could 	never forget the unity 	of the 	Khilafat days. It 	did not 	last, but 	it demonstrated 	the possibilities 	of lasting friendship 	between the 	Hindus and the Muslims. 	That was what he lived for and worked for. He was on his way to 	the Punjab 	to see 	that all 	the Hindus and 	the Sikhs who 	had been turned out 	of Pakistan 	should be able 	to return 	to their 	homes and live there 	in safety 	and honour. 	But on his way he was 	held up at Delhi and he would not leave it till real peace returned 	to the 	capital. Even 	if he was 	the only one 	to say 	it, he would 	never advise the Muslims 	to leave 	their homes. If they 	lived as law-abiding, 	honest and loyal 	citizens of 	India, no 	one could 	touch them. He was 	not the Government, but 	he had 	influence with 	those in the Government. 	He had long 	talks with them. They did 	not believe that in India 	the Muslims 	had no place 	or that 	if the Muslims 	wished to stay 	here they had to do so as slaves 	of the 	Hindus. Some 	people had 	said that Sardar Patel 	encouraged the 	idea of 	Muslims going 	away to Pakistan. 	The Sardar was indignant 	at the 	suggestion. But he 	told him 	(Gandhiji) that 	he had 	reasons to 	suspect that 	the vast 	majority of 	the Muslims in 	India were not 	loyal to 	India. For 	such people it 	was better to 	go to Pakistan. But 	the Sardar did 	not let his suspicion 	colour his actions. 	Gandhiji was 	convinced that 	for the Muslims who 	wished to 	be citizens of 	the Indian 	Union, loyalty 	to the Union 	must come before everything else and 	they should be 	prepared to 	fight against the whole world for their country. Those who wished to go to Pakistan    
 were free to do so. Only he did not wish a single Muslim to leave the Union out of fear  of the Hindus or the Sikhs. Muslims in Delhi had assured him by their written declaration that they were loyal citizens of the Union. He would believe their word as he wished others to believe his. As such it was the duty of the Government to protect them. He for one would not like to live if he could not achieve that. The wrong had to be undone wherever it was. Abducted women had to be returned, forcible conversions considered null and void. The Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan and the Muslims of East Punjab had to be reinstalled in their own homes. In Pakistan and the Union they should produce conditions that not even a little girl, whatever her religion, should feel insecure. He was glad to have read the statement of Khaliquz-zaman Saheb and of the Muslims of Muzaffarnagar. But before he proceeded to Pakistan he had to help to quench the fire in Delhi. If India and Pakistan were to be perpetual enemies and go to war against each other, it would ruin both the dominions and their hard-won freedom would be soon lost. He did not wish to live to see that day.
 Concluding, Gandhiji further advised them that, as a token of their loyalty to the Indian Union, they should issue a public statement that all Hindu women abducted by the Muslims in Pakistan should be restored to their families. They should unequivocally condemn the Pakistan Government where it had departed from the civilized conduct and demand that all those Hindus and Sikhs who had to leave their homes in Pakistan should be invited to return with full guarantee of their safety and self-respect.libtech_623_footnote

   DISCUSSION WITH H. S. SUHRAWARDY  
 [September 18, 1947]libtech_624_footnoteShaheed took upon himself the mission of bringing about a rapprochement between the two Dominions. Gandhiji tried to impress upon him that the crux of the
 problem was that both Governments should make a clean breast of their mistakes and failures. They should honestly and sincerely strive to bring about conditions, each in its own Dominion, that would enable all the refugees to go back to their original homes with a guarantee of safety and equal treatment. What was actually happening in either Dominion was for cible evacuation of the minorities without compensation or any of the guarantees that go with a planned transfer of populations on a reciprocal basis. As a result the refugees had begun to take the law into their own hands and to squeeze out the minorities from the respective Dominions. Pressure was being put upon the Union Government to apply reciprocity to the Indian Muslims. This could
 
 easily lead to a war between the two countries as the Pakistan Government had already declared that they would permit refugees from East Punjab to come over but would resist the entry into Pakistan of Muslims from other parts of India.
 Due to his old associations with the Pakistan leaders, Shaheed possessed a certain initial advantage which he could turn to good account, if he set about the business in the right spirit and in the right way. Gandhiji told him that he should go  to Karachi only if his own heart was free of all prejudice. His usefulness would depend upon his ability courageously to get his old colleague Qaid-e-Azam to face up to his own declarations respecting the minorities which were being honoured more in the breach than the observance. If Shaheed himself lacked the conviction or if his own mind was clouded, his visit would do more harm than good.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 
 NEW DELHI,
 September 18, 1947
 Today we have all lost our senses, we have become stupid. It is not that only the Sikhs have gone mad, or only the Hindus or the Muslims have gone crazy. I am told that the whole thing was started by the Muslims. It is true. I think there is no doubt that the trouble started from their side. But what is the point in harping on it all the time? I have to see what needs to be done today. India is today in the plight of the elephant king.libtech_625_footnoteI want to rescue it if I can. What should I do? I must seek God’s help. I would be happy if my efforts produced some results. But I am just skin and bones. What can such a man do? Whom can he convince? But God can do eveything. Hence, night and day, I turn to Him. I say: “O God, come. Gajaraja is sinking—India is sinking—save her.”
 It cannot be that no one but Hindus should live in India and if the Muslims want to live here they can do so only as slaves. Just listen to what Jawaharlal says: “We are in great difficulty. We cannot attend to our other work. We are busy only with this problem.” What if everybody in Pakistan is depraved? I would say, let our India be the sea in which all the inflowing dirt may be washed away. We cannot do bad things because others do them. I went to Daryaganj today. Some
 
 Muslim friends also come to me. I talk to them, give them affection and tell them that they should not panic. They should be strong. I tell them to stick to their homes. They cannot do any mischief here. That is why I wish that all Hindus should become sane, all Sikhs should become good. Let the Hindus and the Sikhs tell those Muslims who do not wish to go to Pakistan that they should stick to their homes. We have got the Jama Masjid which is the largest mosque in the world. What will happen to that mosque if we kill most of the Muslims or they go away to Pakistan? Will you transfer that mosque to Pakistan? Or will you destroy that mosque or turn it into a Shiva temple? Suppose some Hindu in his pride wants to turn it into a Shiva temple, or a Sikh wants to turn it into a gurdwara—I would say that it would be an attempt to bury Hinduism and Sikhism. No religion can be built up in this manner.
 Those who wish to go to Pakistan should go there. But why should the fear of the Hindus scare them into hiding in the Purana Quila or in Humayun’s Tomb? I told them that those Muslims who are still in their houses should stick on there. I also would get killed for their sake. They felt a little reassured and they said they would die in their places but would not run away. They have been living there since ages. Shall we drive them out today? But that cannot be done. What should we do about those who have already left? I told them that we shall not bring them back immediately. Surely we are not going to bring them back with the help of the police and the military. We shall bring them back only when the Hindus and the Sikhs assure them that they are their friends and that they should return to their homes. They must tell those Muslims that there is no need to engage any police or military for them, rather they will be their police, their military and they will all live like brothers. If we do this in Delhi, I assure you that our way in Pakistan will be absolutely cleared. And that will be the beginning of a new life. When I go to Pakistan I will not spare them. I shall die for the Hindus and the Sikhs there. I shall be really glad to die there. I shall be glad to die here too. If I cannot do what I want to do here, I have got to die. I too feel angry. But human beings should control their anger. I have heard that many women who did not want to lose their honour chose to die. Many men killed their own wives. I think that is really great, because I know that such things make India brave. After all, life and death is a transitory game. Whoever might have died are dead and gone; but at least they have gone with courage. They have not sold away their honour. Not that their lives
 were not dear to them, but they felt it was better to die with courage rather than be forcibly converted to Islam by the Muslims and allow them to assault their bodies. And so those women died. They were not just a handful, but quite a few. When I hear all these things, I dance with joy that there are such brave women in India. But where is the place for those who have already fled? They must return and return with honour. Let there be justice at least on our side. Let us keep our hearts and hands clean. Then we can ask for justice before the whole world. I have already said that the Muslims who possess arms should surrender their arms. As I said the day before yesterday, let everyone hand over the arms. I think this process will take some time but now that it has started, arms have got to be given up. We cannot protect ourselves with arms.
 Another big complaint I have been receiving is that our police and military which includes the Hindus, Sikhs and also Christians and Gorkhas, who are all supposed to be protectors, have themselves become destroyers. I do not know how far this is true. But I want to address myself to the police and request them to behave. I have heard that in some places the police themselves started the looting. I have heard that there was some trouble at Connaught Place today and the soldiers and the police started looting and plundering. Maybe the reports are false. But if there is the slightest truth in them then I will tell the police and the military that the days of the British are over. In those days they could do what they liked. But now they belong to India. They should not behave as if they were enemies of the Muslims. When they are ordered to protect them, they have got to protect them.

 CHI. RAMESHWARI,
I got your letter yesterday.
 This much is clear that if nothing can be done here, I shall not be able to do anything there either. Do what you can surrendering everything to God. All will turn out right.
 Jawaharlal told me that you would be coming here.  Bapalibtech_627_footnotealso said the same. My view is that you should do what you can there with the utmost peace of mind. It is another matter if you can do nothing and can have no peace of mind. In the end, follow the promptings of your heart. Keep well both of you.
 The task here is a difficult one. Suhrawardy came yesterday. He is staying with me.
 I feel happy whenever I hear that Brijlallibtech_628_footnotehelps you a great deal. This is as it should be. I have his letters. I showed them to Jawaharlal. I am not writing separately to him.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING        NEW 	DELHI, 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  September 	19, 1947 
  	I have received a note. It first went to Sardar. The note says that 	the Hindus would not keep quiet if they were to live with the 	Muslims. The Hindus had to flee from Pakistan. In Koocha Tara Chand 	they are surrounded by Muslims and are afraid of being shot by them. 	Hence  it would be better if all the Muslims went away from there. 	Many of them have already gone, but quite a few are still left 	behind. I have told you that when I went to them yesterday I told 	them the opposite thing. So there is no question of migration of 	those who are here. I would ask the people who have gone away to 	come back. It is not forcing them to return. Surely we cannot resort 	to force in the Panchayati Raj that we are having. We must persuade 	people, train them. Why should we be so frightened of them? Have the 	Muslims with whom we have been living for years become so bad that 	they cannot be allowed to stay here? I do not say that they cannot 	become bad. But if those who were good can become bad, they can 	again become good also. We may all be good. But it is not enough to 	be good. We must also be brave and at the same time have wisdom. 	Then from association with us even the bad people will become good. 	This is not my law, it is the law of the world. As I told you 	yesterday, I have learnt this from my childhood. I would not be able 	to learn any new lesson now. And how long am I going to live? You 	are telling me all this, but I say that I cannot bear it. Not that I 	would kill somebody; it is possible that I will die myself.  	I have another note. Someone gave it to me on the way. What- ever 	notes I receive on the way, I try to read them in the car. In that 	note I have been asked why I do not come to my senses even after 	such atrocities in West Punjab. There is yet another note bearing no 	name or signature. It is addressed to the members of the Muslim 	League. It is full of accusations of filthy things. It is difficult 	to know what will happen to Pakistan and India if the followers of 	the League behave in that manner. Should we also resort to filthy 	means? That is not the correct thing, according to me. Muslims 	are living around there. Some Muslim workers have 
 chosen to live there. They want to serve the Muslims. Let somebody come and kill them if he wishes. They are living there because they are brave. They approached me. There are quite a few such Muslims. They say that a large number of Muslims have left their homes. But even after that I found that Muslims were in a pretty large number. There were very few Hindus. I told those Hindus, who have escaped, that I have learnt only one thing since my childhood. I have believed even before entering politics that Hindus and Muslims have to live in amity. That is how India is made and that is how India should remain. A man who has been doing the same work from the age of twelve cannot speak anything different today. I would like every man to stand firm in his place and die there. This is what I tell Muslims as well as Hindus.
 The Hindus say that Muslims are having arms; if they do not surrender them, how can they be sure that they will not strike them from behind? I would tell the Hindus that we should not bother about this. It is the job of the Government. If they have no license, they cannot possess arms, even for self-defence. But how are they going to defend themselves with arms? If there are five Muslims there are five hundred Hindus and Sikhs. Where is the comparison? Let them continue to live here even if the Hindus and the Sikhs slaughter them. These five who let themselves be killed, and depart with the name of God on their lips rather than use the arms, would be really brave. They should say that the Hindus and the Sikhs are their brothers and may kill them if they choose to. I give the same advice to all. Today a large number of Hindus from Pakistan came to see me and narrated to me their woes. Some nar-rated their tales smilingly while some women broke down. I told them and through you I wish to tell everybody that we should not be cowards. Just because the Muslims of Pakistan have committed atrocities, let us not be frightened by the Muslims living here. Let us not frighten them either. There are also some Muslims who just cannot live in Pakistan.
 So the note which I have received says that since the non- Muslims are not going to live in Pakistan, why should the Muslims live in India? But I say that if there is one man doing something wrong let us not imitate and do similar things ourselves.  Pakistan  or Islam cannot mean that non-Muslims cannot live there. The Muslim empire has spread far and wide; but nowhere was it laid down that non- Muslims cannot live there. Non-Muslims used to live there and lived in peace. They also possessed money. Is Islam now coming to India as a
 
 new phenomenon? Islam has lived on for the last 1,300 years. There have been great renunciations and sacrifices for its sake. If any other type of Islam emerges, it would not be genuine and acceptable to all Muslims as good. Think over this. It means that true India is not that in which none but the Hindus can live. True Christianity is not that which does not accept in its fold anyone who is not a Christian. That is not religion but irreligion. The world has not followed that path, is not following it at present nor will follow it in future. Why should we then, try to write a new history? Let us not ruin India and allow Pakistan to
 be 	ruined. There are 4libtech_629_footnote crore 	Muslims in India. Where can all of them 
  	go? And should they take the Jama Masjid, the Aligarh University and 	all those Muslim tombs to Pakistan? And should all the gurdwaras in 	West Punjab be brought to East Punjab? If the Hindus cannot live in 	Pakistan, their temples will then have to be brought here. This 	means that everybody wants to ruin himself and destroy religion. I 	have no desire to be a witness to it. Let God take me away before 	that. And I would say that all those young men should die doing 	their duty. Let not India be ruined while they are alive. I do not 	want to see the country ruined. If anything, I only want to see that 	we all die in the attempt to remove the evils in the country. [From 	Hindi]  Prarthana 	Pravachan—I, pp. 	324-7

 and what fodder and concentrates should be given to them so that we get better milk. This is the true service.

       From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G. N. 1984      TALK WITH AN ADVOCATE    Regards 	from  MANU          NEW 	DELHI, 
  September 	20, 1947  ADVOCATE: You 	should publicly state that so long as the Muslims do not surrender 	their weapons they cannot be resettled. GANDHIJI: 	You do not seem to be aware that I have already stated this 	publicly.  You 	should also say that the refugees fleeing to India are being 	murdered.  	I cannot state this because both the communities are in the same 	plight. I have said that any man who is not loyal to India may be 	shot. Surely it is not your argument that all the Muslims are bad 	and all the Hindus are good or that all of them are goondas. You do 	not suggest that even those not proved guilty should be shot. Yes, 	the British did that. But now we are dealing with our own brethren. 	Everybody says that Suhrawardy is a goonda. And yet what was 	achieved in Calcutta could not have been achieved if I had been all 	alone and his help had not been forthcoming. If people drink, does 	that mean we should also drink? Therefore we must either purify 	Hinduism or die in the attempt. But if we do with others as others 	do with us, then we might as well become Muslims. Let us be 	upholders of Hinduism, not its destroyers. If we become destroyers 	of Hinduism then certainly I do not wish to be a witness to it. I 	would rather die before that. All Hindus should make their hearts 	pure. I commend the action of the sisters who threw themselves into 	wells. What was done in Bihar was no trifling matter. But Biharis 	are simple people. They admitted their guilt. What has happened in 	Pakistan is certainly terrible from all accounts.  Do 	you think four-and-a-half crores of Muslims will not get out of hand 	some  day? 
 It is my firm conviction that that will not happen, provided, of course, that Hindus do what I say. And if they do that, Muslims will respect them.

 Dilhiman Gandhiji—I, 34
 
    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       NEW 	DELHI, 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  September 	20, 1947 
  	You must pray to God and have faith in Him. Everyone is not 	convinced of this. People ask: ‘Where is God?’ They ask why they 	should be in so much trouble if God exists. If the Muslims are in 	trouble, they question the truth of Allah and the Koran. A  large 	number of people talk in these terms, but they are all mistaken. 	This is the time to remember Khuda, Allah, Ishwar and Rama. He helps 	us without fail. Surely He is not going to ask us if we have 	recognized Him. We cannot hold Him in our hands nor see Him with our 	eyes, or hear Him with our ears. That is why it is said that He is 	beyond our physical senses. He is real; all else is unreal. We are 	all unreal. We may ask how we can be unreal when we are alive. I am 	alive today. But no one can tell me if I shall be alive tomorrow. I 	have thus passed 78 years wondering about tomorrow. I may live for a 	few days more or I may live for another year. But how can we 	know—how can I say—that the man who is alive now will be living 	the next minute? No one can say that. That is why I say that we are 	all unreal and we can never be sure what may happen to us at any 	moment. We cannot survive for ever. He alone can be real. The word 	hasti is derived from the Sanskrit word asti, which 	means ‘to be’, it was, it is and it will remain forever. What 	lives for ever is this Reality (God) that has created us and can 	destroy us and that takes us away from the world. In my view He 	never destroys us; He only helps us. If today we suspect that He 	cannot be realized and therefore get angry, it would be foolish. But 	He exists and is capable of doing everything. He is  Rahimlibtech_631_footnotelibtech_632_footnoteand 	all are equal in his eyes. He would never harm anyone, nor kill or 	curse anyone. That is His law.    
 Muslims also come to me. They narrate to me their plight here. They say that they have been living in Delhi but now they find it impossible to do so. I tell them that they should continue to live here as long as I am alive. During the Khilafat days Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, all used to be together. I have gone to gurdwaras accompanied by Muslims. During that famous Nankana incidentlibtech_633_footnotelibtech_634_footnoteMaulana Saheb and the Ali Brothers were with me. There was a general feeling of fellowship, whether they were Hindus or Muslims or Sikhs. What happened at Jallianwala Bagh? People cried at the top of their voices that the blood of all communities had mingled there. Who could separate them? How is it that they have now been separated? I am really perplexed. If I am still here, alive, it is only in the belief that the blood of these three communities is one. I would do everything possible to prove this. I would cry myself hoarse and shed tears before God in order to attain this. I do not shed tears before man, but I can do so before God. I can plead with Him, because I am His slave. Everybody should be His slave. Then there would be no need for man to be anybody’s slave. I say that I would wish to be alive if I can do this. If not, I would wish that God takes me away.
 My head bows in shame, I feel ashamed that the Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims, who till recently looked upon one another as brothers have now become enemies. Let at least some people come forward and say that they cannot be enemies. Four or five persons who came to me
 said 	that 4libtech_635_footnote crore 	Muslims would become traitors when the time 
  	came. For, after all, they are Muslims, and there are Muslims in 	Pakistan too. Supposing there was a war between India and Pakistan, 	or some similar conditions arose, would they not, in that event, 	secretly help Pakistan? I told these people that some [Muslims] 	might very well help Pakistan, but all of them would not do so. I 	told those people that if they would remain good, if we would remain 	good, if all Hindus in large number here and all the Sikhs would 	remain good and not consider any Muslim their enemy, then I could 	claim at the top of my 
 voice 	that none of these 4libtech_636_footnote crore 	Muslims would turn disloyal. We 
  	must be brave. Being in the majority we should not be cowards. There 
 are 	4libtech_637_footnote crore 	Muslims in India but the total population of the country 
 is 	40 crores. Should they become such cowards as to be afraid of 4libtech_638_footnote      
 crore Muslims? I say that if those 4libtech_639_footnote
crore Muslims betray the
  	country, they would be betraying Islam, and they would be destroying 	Islam. But if we also behave that way, and become cowards and 	traitors and do not trust them at all and do not allow a single 	Muslim to live here, let me tell you that the Hindus alone would not 	be able to eat a morsel here. Their food would become poison.  	If there is aggression from the Muslims outside India or from 
 any 	other power or from Pakistan, I say that these 4libtech_640_footnote crore 	Muslims 
  	here will have to be loyal to the country. The law says that if they 	are not loyal to the country, they should be shot. My law is however 	different. I have explained it to you. But who is going to accept 	it? According to the law of the world the only punishment for a 	traitor, a fifth columnist, anyone indulging in subversive 	activities against his 
 own 	country, is death. I say that in such a vast country, all the 4libtech_641_footnote crore 
 Muslims 	cannot be traitors. Who has seen all these 4libtech_642_footnote crore 	Muslims? 
  	They are in our seven lakh villages. A few are in the cities. They 	are in U.P., in Bihar, scattered in the villages. I have lived in 	the villages and I know them all. They can never be traitors. There 	are Muslims in Sevagram too. They are working there. They would be 	loyal to Sevagram, they would lay down their lives for it. What do 	they know what the Muslims in other places may be doing? And why 	should we be afraid of traitors? I am not afraid of them. If, living 	in India,  	they become traitors, I would say that they are keen on dying and on 	destroying Islam.  	Real kafirs are those who eat our bread, serve in our posts but act 	as our enemies and cut our throats. There are such Hindus too; and 	also Sikhs and Muslims. There are all kinds of people in this world. 
 But 	it would be cowardice to believe that all the 4libtech_643_footnote crore 	Muslims 
  	living here would become such traitors. It shows that we are not 	true Hindus, nor true Sikhs. Our goodness and the goodness of all 	the officials, the goodness and courage of the Hindus and the Sikhs 	lies in telling the Muslims not to leave. They must be persuaded and 	convinced that no one would be allowed to touch them. They should be 	asked to forget our wrongful deeds and assured that such deeds will 	not be repeated. We should ask them why they want to leave, and 	whether they know what will happen to them in Pakistan. They must be 	reminded that they have their homes and everything else here. If we 	kept them back with such affection the Muslim Afridis in the 
 Frontier Province and Dera-Ismail Khan would tell our people that they should not run away. This is the effect of good behaviour. If you maintain peace in Delhi, and that not because you are  afraid or because Gandhi says it, but because that is the honest desire in your heart, I can promise you that no Muslim will do you any harm. And if he does, there is God above. He is all-powerful, and all must answer Him. He will protect us, and I have no doubt about it at all in my heart.

    SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       NEW 	DELHI, 
     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  September 	21, 1947 
  	Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims cannot continue to live the way they are 	living now. It pains me very much and I shall do everything humanly 	possible to remedy the situation. Let me tell you that if I cannot 	do what my heart desires, I shall not feel happy to remain alive.libtech_649_footnoteIt is well and good if God takes that work out of me. 	But if that is not to happen, I will believe that my work is over. 	It is not that I would like to die by committing suicide. It is true 	that for those who wish to spend their lives in serving others, 	there can be no other test. Let them not be disturbed if they find 	their efforts bearing no fruit. But when one’s efforts do not 	bring forth results, one must dry up like a tree which does not bear 	fruits. And he does dry up. That is the law of nature. According to 	Hindu philosophy, the soul is immortal. It does not die. A body 	which has outlived itself is of no use and must perish. A new body 	takes its place. But the soul is immortal and assumes evernew 	physical  forms  in  order  to  attain  muktilibtech_650_footnotethrough service.  	Today I went to a place where a large number of Hindus on the one 	side and Muslims on the other were living together. They raised the 	slogan “Mahatma Gandhi Zindabad”. What did it mean? What purpose 	would it serve if Hindus and Muslims were not one at heart and could 	not live together in peace? So I found that cry somewhat harsh. I 	asked those Muslims why they should be in panic. We have to die 	ultimately, and so we shall. If we are killed, it will be at the 	hands of none else but our own brothers. I appealed to them not to 	be angry with Hindus, nor try to kill them. I said they might die, 	but should not run away from their place in panic. But I also heard 	people saying that the Mahatma was a bad man wanting to bring back 	the Muslims to the     
 houses from where they had been driven out. It is indeed true that I want to bring them back. But how do I want to bring them back? Those who wish to go to Pakistan out of their own choice should not be prevented in any way. But it would pain me very much if they wanted to go because they were afraid, because they felt that the Government was not able to protect them and the Hindus and the Sikhs would not protect them in any case. To those who do not want to go to Pakistan and want to live here, I shall say that they should not go from here. I told them that those who have gone away from here could and should come back only when the Hindus and the Sikhs would gladly permit them to do so. I do not approve of bringing them back with the help of the police and the army. I tell them to give up the idea of police and military help. We shall do ourselves what we want to do. We shall die if we are destined to die. But if one person is bent upon killing, if he has lost his senses, why should I retaliate by losing my senses in turn? I would prefer to die at his hands. I am not speaking on behalf of the Government. The Government is not in my hands. You know the way I am made. If somebody goes crazy and indulges in evil acts, I cannot do the same. Later on, that man will learn from me how to be good. There are 40 crore Hindus and Muslims in India. A few lakh Muslims have gone to Pakistan. But
 there 	are still 4libtech_651_footnote crore 	Muslims in India. The rest are all Hindus. There 
  	is a small proportion of Parsi, Christian and Jewish population. But 	that is hardly significant. Thus if they want to perish by fighting 	each other, let them do so, but life is not worth living if one has 	to survive with the help of the police and the army. What should the 	Government do in the face of such fighting by Hindus, and Muslims 	among themselves? Let the Government declare that it can act only in 	that manner or it is ready to resign. Then let those who want only 	the Hindus in India because there are only Muslims in Pakistan form 	the Government. Does it mean that we should act in frenzy because 	the people in Pakistan are doing so? We can do so if we so wish. 	Suppose there is a friend whom I abuse and he abuses me still more 	in turn. It is all right. But if I hear his abuses in silence, how 	long will he go on abusing? If he beats me, I submit to that too. I 	do not raise my fist against his fist. Do you know what would happen 	in that case? I have seen that if a man swings his fist in the air, 	he injures his own hand. Even a boxer boxes against a big stiff 	cushion. He enjoys the game only when he strikes against some 	tangible object. But if the boxer does not keep something in front 	of him he becomes helpless and is 
 able to do nothing. What I have told you is an eternal truth. I am the only one steadfastly clinging to it. People are not following that path these days. God alone knows if I will be able to stand by that truth till the end. I am making a simple point today. Let the Muslims who have left their homes remain where they are, but they have got to be fed. We cannot starve them and then ask them to go to Pakistan. We are preparing the ground for war by doing so. The Congress Government is really for the service of the country and not for money, not for power; and it is meant not for one community or two but for all communities. If people are angry and are not satisfied with its service and do not allow it to serve, it should step down. And then let there be  a government of those who want to keep only the Hindus in India. But that would lead to the ruin of Hinduism and Hindustan also. Let us forget Pakistan. Let it do whatever it wants. Let us think only about India. Then the whole world will admire us and be with us. Otherwise, the world which has been looking towards India all this time will start ignoring it. The countries of the world regarded India as a great country inhabited by good people who could not be corrupted. That faith would then be destroyed. You may behave as you like. But I shall continue to warn you, so long as I am alive, that such behaviour would bring no good to any one.

 [After September 21, 1947]libtech_653_footnoteThese are not old days. Now there are wheels within wheels. You  can’t do any useful service by seeing these military men except as
friendly faces who will give you a warm welcome but nothing more.

   MY DUTYlibtech_654_footnote  
 This heading has reference only to my duty about  the conducting of the Harijan papers. A fair number of replies have been received in answer to my querylibtech_655_footnotelibtech_656_footnote. The majority of the readers with a few exceptions want the papers to be continued. The purport of these letters is that the readers desire my views on present-day topics. This means that probably after my death these will no longer be required.
My death can take place in three ways :
 The 	usual dissolution of 	the body. Only 	the eyes 	move but the mind 	no longer works.  The 	body and 	mind may 	work but 	I may 	withdraw from 	all public activity. 
 The first kind overtakes everybody—some die today, others tomorrow. It demands no consideration.
 The second variety is to be wished by or for nobody. I for one do not wish for any such imbecile state. It is a burden on earth.
 The third variety does demand serious consideration. Some readers suggest that the period of my active life should be over now. A new age for India began on 15th August last. There is no place for me in that age. I detect anger in this advice as it is worded. It therefore carries little weight with me. Such counsellors are few. I have come to an independent conclusion. The Harijan papers are being conducted and published under the Navajivan Trust. The trustees can stop publication whenever they choose. They have full powers. They do not desire any such stoppage. My life-line is cast in active public service. I have not attained the state which is known as “action in inaction”.libtech_657_footnoteMy activity, therefore, seems at present to be destined to continue till the last breath. Nor is it capable of being divided into water-tight compartments. The root of all lies in Truth otherwise
 
 
 known to me as non-violence. Hence the papers must continue as they are. “One step enough for me.”

 513. DRAFT OFA CONFESSIONlibtech_665_footnote
 September 22, 1947 We two girls were guilty of a grievous error during the prayer yesterday. We wish to purify ourselves by confessing it before all of
you. The error consisted in our bursting into laughter when we went
 out of tune. We knew that it was wrong to laugh but we could not control ourselves. This shows that we are not absorbed in prayer. We thus insulted our Maker. Bapu has repeatedly told us that a prayer is effective only when we are thinking of God. We knew that  even  though his eyes were closed Bapu would know and would be much hurt, and that is what happened. We sought his forgiveness and he has forgiven us. But the pain has persisted. It persists even now. We hope that our public confession will relieve it to some extent. Only our future conduct can wholly eliminate it. We entreat the public to bless us that God may make and keep the two of us pure.

  517. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETINGlibtech_667_footnote     NEW 	DELHI, 
  September 22, 1947 Though 	I believe that I was wise in having yielded to a solitary objector 	and refrained from holding public prayer,libtech_668_footnotelibtech_669_footnotelibtech_670_footnoteit 	is not improper to 	examine the incident a little more fully. The prayer was public only  	in the sense that no member of the public was debarred  from  	attending it. It was on private premises. Propriety required that 	those only should attend who believed whole-heartedly in the prayer 	including verses from the Koran. Indeed the rule should be 	applicable to prayer held even on public grounds. A prayer meeting 	is not a debating assembly. It is possible to conceive prayer 	meetings of many communities on the same plot of land. Decency 	requires that those who are opposed to particular prayers shall 	abstain from attending the meetings they object to. The reverse 	would make any meeting impossible without disturbance. Freedom of 	worship, even of public speech, would become a farce if interference 	became the order of the day. In decent society the exercise of this 	elementary right should not need the protection of the bayonet. It 	should command universal acceptance.  	I have noticed with great joy at the annual sessions of the Congress 	on its exhibition grounds several meetings held by religious sects 	or political parties holding their gatherings, expressing divergent 	and often diametrically opposite views without molestation  and 	without any assistance from the police. There have been departures 	from this fundamental rule and they have excited public condem- 	nation. Where has that spirit of healthy toleration gone now? Is it 	because having gained our political freedom, we are testing it by 	abusing it? Let us hope it is only a passing phase in the nation’s 	life.  	Let me not be told, as I have often been, that it is all due to the 	misdeeds of the Muslim League. Assuming the truth of the remark, is 	our toleration made of such poor stuff that it must yield under some 	uncommon strain? Decency and toleration to be of value must be     
 capable of standing the severest strain. If they cannot, it will be a sad day for India. Let us not make it easy for our critics (we have many) to say that we did not deserve liberty. Many arguments come to my mind in answer to such critics. But they give poor comfort. It hurts my pride as a lover of India, of the teeming millions, that our tolerant and combined culture should not be self-evident.
 If India fails, Asia dies. It has been aptly called the nursery of many blended cultures and civilizations. Let India be and remain the hope of all the exploited races of the earth, whether in Asia, Africa or in any part of the world.
 This brings me to the bugbear of unlicensed, hidden arms. Some have undoubtedly been found. Driblets have been coming to me voluntarily. Let them be unearthed by all means. So far as I know, the haul made up-to-date is not much to speak of for Delhi. Hidden arms used to be possessed even during the British regime. No one worried then. By all means explode all the hidden magazines, when you have made sure beyond doubt that they are hidden in a particular place. Let there be no repetition of much cry and little wool. Nor let us apply one code to the British and set up another for ourselves when we profess to be politically free. Let us not call a dog a bad name in order to beat him. After all is said and done, to be worthy of the liberty we have won after sixty years of toil, let us bravely face all the difficulties that confront us, however hard they may be. Facing them squarely will make us fitter and nobler.
 Surely it is cowardly on the part of the majority to kill or banish the minority for fear that they will all be traitors. Scrupulous regard for the rights of minorities well becomes a majority. Disregard of them makes of a majority a laughing-stock. Robust faith in oneself and brave trust of the opponent, socalled or real, is the best safeguard. Therefore I plead with all the earnestness at my command that all the Hindus, the Sikhs and the Muslims in Delhi should meet together in friendly embrace and set a noble example to the rest India, shall I say, to the world? Delhi should forget what other parts of India have done or are doing. Then only will it claim the proud privilege of having broken the vicious circle of private revenge and retaliation. They belong, if they ever do, to the State, never to the citizens as individuals.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING       NEW 	DELHI, 
  September 	23, 1947  BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  It has been said that prayer is no ordinary thing. It issomething noble. In the course of our lives we 	talk all kinds of things, we talk quite a 	bit in 24 hours, 	we commit crimes 	and run madly after money; so let us at least offer some prayer. It would be a great thing 	if we pray together. If 40 crores pray in their own languages in the 	belief that God is one, it would be a great thing. And then we should not mind if 	there are some stanzas 	from the Koran in 	the prayer. Those 	who protest against recitation from 	the Koran, do so in anger.libtech_673_footnotelibtech_674_footnoteBut,  because  the  Muslims  are  harassing  the  Hindus  and Sikhs and killing them, 	should we get angry over the Koran? What the Muslims 	have done is not good, but 	what harm has the Koran 	done? If one devotee of God commits a sin, shall 	we stop repeating His name?God is 	only one. If the devotees of 	God say that what the Hindus have done is bad, does it also mean 	that the Gita is bad? 	If the Sikhs have done bad things, should we 	stop reading the Granth Saheb? What harm has the Granth Saheb done? What if the Sikhs go crazy, if the Hindus, Muslims, Parsis go 	crazy? Their religions and all the sacrifices made in the name of those religions will remain for libtech_675_footnoteSome 	people who 	came to 	me from Rawalpindi 	were strong, sturdy, and 	brave, and 	were big 	business magnates. 	Rawalpindi was 	built by 	the Hindus 	and the Sikhs. 	So also 	was Lahore. And, 	was the whole 	of Pakistan built solely 	by the 	Muslims? What is 	Pakistan today 	was built 	by the 	common efforts of 	all, not only of 	one community. 	It would 	not be 	proper to 	say that India 	was built 	the Hindus 	since their number 	is much 	larger. It 	has been 	built by the 	Hindus, Muslims and 	the Sikhs, 	by the 	Parsis and 	the Christians. All 	have contributed 	to making 	India what it 	is today. I 	told these 	friends that they should 	keep calm, and 	that after all, there 	was God to 	take care of 	everything. There is 	no place where there is 	no God. Pray 	to God 	and repeat His 	name, and 	then all 	will be 	well. They 	asked me what 	we should do    
 about those who are in Pakistan. But I in turn asked them why they came here instead of laying down their lives there. I am firm in my belief that in spite of atrocities being committed we should remain where we are and die. If people come to kill us, let us die. But let us die with courage, repeating the name of God. I have taught the same thing to the girls. I have told them to learn the art of dying with the name of God on their lips. There may be a wicked man who refuses to see the reality—he may be a Hindu, a Sikh, a Parsi or anyone else— but they can at least refuse to be cowed down by him. If he offers money, he should be told that he may kill right at that moment instead of five minutes later, but it should be made clear to him that they will not submit to him. They should not be taken in just because of the money. I will give the same advice to the girls as long as I am alive. I cannot give them any other advice. I do not wish to forget God. That is why I am telling all that the greatest courage and understanding lie in learning the art of dying. Then alone can they live. If they do not learn the art of dying, they will die before their time. I do not wish that anybody should die before his time. I also told the Muslims that they should not leave their homes. Rather, they should die where they were. I told the same thing to the people from Rawalpindi. I will plead with the Government to do whatever they can. I told them that since they had come here, they should visit the camps and work there. I said they were strong people and should not lose heart. I told them they should not plead helplessness and be worried about lack of accommodation. I told them there was accommodation all right—Mother Earth is our house and we have the sky overhead. The Muslims who have gone away in panic have left behind their houses and their lands. Should I tell them that they should occupy the houses of those Muslims? I cannot say anything of the kind. Those houses still belong to their Muslim owners as they did in the past. They have run away in fear. If they have gone away of their own accord and if they feel that they will be happy in Pakistan, let them be happy there. Do not harm them. Let them go in peace. They should take their property and jewellery with them. The houses they leave will be in the possession of the Government and it can do whatever it chooses about them. It would not be proper if our refugees go and occupy them on their own. One thing I know for certain is that you should be strong and do as I tell you so that you can let me go from here. I want to go to the Punjab. I want to go to Lahore. I do not want to go with any police or military escort. I want to go alone, depending only on God. I want to go with
 faith and trust in the Muslims there. Let them kill me if they want. I would die smiling, and silently pray that God should kind to them. And how can God be kind to them? By making them good. With God, the only way of making them good is by purifying their hearts. God will listen to me if I do not have a feeling of animosity even for one who regards me as his enemy. Then that man would ask himself what he would have gained by killing me. He would wonder what harm I had done him. If they kill me they have a right to do so. That is why I want to go to Lahore. I want to go to Rawalpindi. Let the Government stop me if they will. But how can the Government stop me? They will have to kill me if they want to stop me. If they kill me, my death will leave a lesson for you. It will make me very happy. What will be that lesson? It will be that you may have to die but you will not wish evil to anybody.
 Dhruva was a mere child. He prayed to God. What about Prahlad? He was a boy of twelve. he also did the same. And we are all their descendants. Those who are familiar with the Granth Saheb must be knowing that Guru Nanak Saheb taught that we should not have evil thoughts for anyone, nor use the sword against anyone. The greatest bravery lies in having the courage to die. If our people have to die in this manner, let us not be angry with anybody. You must admire those people for dying and pray to God that He grant a similar opportunity to all of us. Let this be our sincere prayer. I would tell you what I told those people from Rawalpindi. I told them that they should go there and meet the Hindus and Sikh refugees. They should request them to return on their own, not under police or military protection. If you avoid fighting in Delhi I will take it that God has granted my prayer. Then with the grace of God, I will go to the Punjab. Let me tell you that once peace descends on Delhi, I shall not stay here even a day longer. I have not stayed here for pleasure. I have stayed on for rendering service. I have remained here to do all that a man can do to extinguish the fire raging here. So I wish to tell you and those friends who have come from Rawalpindi how you should live and what you should do so that the fragrance of  your  lives spreads over the whole of India and the world.

I have not transferred, and do not wish to transfer, the responsibility of collecting the money to you. I do feel, of course, that I would not have undertaken that responsibility, if you had not shown interest in the scheme. But I see no inconsistency in that. Please explain to me again. If there has been any error on my part. I will admit it. I have often confessed that my memory is not what it used to be. As I  have admitted my shortcoming, the question of reminding me of it again does not arise.

 I have no doubt at all that we should ask for no grants from the Central Government for Hindustani propaganda work. Let Sunderlal or the Urdu Anjuman get them. We do not wish to follow their example.

  TALK WITH JAMSAHEB OF NAWANAGAR 
 BIRLA HOUSE, NEW DELHI,
 September 24, 1947
 GANDHIJI: If war comes to Kathiawar it would be the fault of the rulers.
 JAMSAHEB: But where do we have the arms? Before the 15th we were treated as step sons.
If the ruler has the subjects with him, what can a single
 Junagadhlibtech_687_footnotedo?  If even one ruler decides that he will function  as  a trustee of his subjects, he can rule for ever. The rulers express their willingness, readily enough, but I doubt whether they do so from the heart. If you can win the hearts of your people, rest assured Junagadh will be with you. If a man is pure he can have nothing secret. In India the Princes are the weakest part. But through the skill of Sardar all the Princes have now been brought in. However, the rulers of Kathiawar should be united. That is why I have been talking of the unity of Kathiawar these last so many years. The railways of Kathiawar are in a bad shape. Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Morvi, Porbundar, have all their separate railways. In the third class there are not even lights. That is why these trains  were  called  Babu’s  trains.libtech_688_footnoteWhen  I  used  to  be  a student of Shamaldas College the state of affairs was the same. This is merely an example. If there is one administration, one currency and if the people are united the Sardar will not say no. Kathiawar has much potential strength.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING      NEW 	DELHI, 
  September 	24, 1947  BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	The bhajan which you heard today applies well to the present 	situation. We can all describe ourselves today as ‘wrecked boats’. 	And then we pray to God that He may bring us to the shore, that is, 	without His grace our boat cannot reach the shore. This is the 	condition of our country today and I see it everyday. Somehow, a 	feeling of animosity has taken possession of us. There is so much 	anger in the hearts of both the Hindus and the Muslims, that we 	would not let the Muslims live in Delhi. The Hindus and the Sikhs 	have been driven out of Pakistan. I hear that even the minds of 	small children have been poisoned. It is true that all that is the 	propaganda of the Muslim League. I am a witness to the propaganda of 	the Muslim League that the Muslims would take Pakistan by 	force, not by negotiating for it, not by pleading their case with 	the Hindus and other non-Muslims. It was our misfortune that for 	years they went on clamouring that they would take Pakistan by 	force. But that will never do. What is the point in having it by 	force? In a way we can say that they have not taken Pakistan by 	force. Rather we have granted it, the Congress has granted it. There 	would have been no Pakistan without the British agreeing to the 	demand. However much the Congress might have agreed to it, the 	ultimate power was in the hands of the British. They had to give up 	that power. Why? Because they could not have ruled here any longer. 	We did not fight against them with the sword. Ours was a war without 	weapons. We say that ours was a non-violent struggle. That is how 	India has won freedom. India was partitioned. The Congress agreed to 	the division. The Congress felt that there was no point in brothers 	going on fighting. The better thing would be to grant them what they 	wanted. But some of them feel that they have not got Pakistan in 	full. But they have accepted what was granted, leaving the rest of 	it for the future. So, we did get our freedom but we could not 	digest it with all the poison everywhere. And the dispute between us 	did not end. The supporters of the Muslim League delivered poisonous 	speeches. Are all the people living in Pakistan Muslims? There are 	also the Hindus, the Parsis, the Sikhs and the Christians living 	there. Let them make all 
 in their country happy. Let them prove to them that all of them will have equal rights. The Government will be no doubt theirs because they are in the majority. That is all right, but the Government has to function with a sense of justice. They did say so, but it could not be carried out. Why should I go into the reasons as to why it could not be done? I know everything that has happened there. The Muslims went berserk. They thought that since they were now free they could kill and slaughter. It all started from there. And once it started, there were the Sikhs who are also warriors. How could they take it lying down? They also started killing and slaughtering. That is the story which is not yet over.
 Thousands of people come to me and say that they cannot live there any longer. They say that they are being forced to embrace Islam and if they fail to do so they are threatened that they will be kept as slaves. How could they agree to such a condition? They have come here under compulsion. We can embrace Islam of our own free choice. But getting converted to Islam out of fear is another matter. One cannot abandon one’s religion for the sake of earning one’s livelihood. Abandoning religion under compulsion is not religion but irreligion. What is the value of mere survival of a man or woman who has lost his or her self-respect—and religion constitutes self-respect. Let me tell you that those who give up their religion for the sake of money, jewellery or employment, cannot be following any religion. They do not deserve to be called Hindus, nor can they be good Muslims. Do we become Muslims just by reciting the Kalma under compulsion? I do not recite here the Kalma but fateha. Both are remarkable. It is ordained in the Kalma that there is only one God and Hazrat Mohammed is His Prophet. The earlier prophets do not count before him. But it is clearly stated in the feteha that God is our Lord and Master. He can protect everyone; let Him protect us too. But even though fateha is wonderful, how can one be forced to recite it? If we recite it, it can be only of our own free will. But if somebody forces me to recite it under threat of gun, I would certainly not like to do it. I have just a handful of bones in my body. But my heart belongs to me. So do your hearts belong to you and the hearts of these girls belong to them. These girls can declare that they would never give up their dharma. But today we are all facing a challenge. In such a situation, what should India do? How should we act? That is a big problem before you. The trains coming from Pakistan these days do not bring the Muslims. The Hindus and the Sikhs are brought in those trains.
 Some get killed in the train. And the people who go from here are Muslims who are killed on the way. I am told that I should count the figures. What figures should I count? I have no figures with me. And what will I do knowing the figures? I would only say that one may consume one bottle of liquor and get intoxicated. Someone else may drink two bottles and also get completely intoxicated. Both get intoxicated. But another man drinks something by which he cannot get intoxicated, such as clean water from a river. You may call it liquor but it cannot intoxicate anyone. Who would call that water alcohol? For alcohol is the thing that robs one of all one’s senses and turns one crazy. The thing is we are all intoxicated at the moment. Now suppose the Muslim League does something crazy because something got into its head. And then we think that if they can behave like that let us also behave in the same manner. You may want to rule the whole of India and destroy Pakistan. But I tell you that we have agreed to the formation of Pakistan. Where then is the question of destroying it? We cannot destroy it. We cannot destroy it with our physical strength or with the help of the sword. If we try to destroy Pakistan, both the countries are going to sink. Ours is a wrecked ship. We are sinking today. If you imagine today that we should fight and win, I would say that even before you win some other world power is going to swallow you. It would swallow both the countries. If all my friends, who are sensible people and who have spent many years in such work, understand this much, we would be safe. But how could that happen when both are busy emptying whisky bottles and enjoy doing so? I would entreat them to discard the whisky bottle and throw it into the sea because it contains poison. We shall not harm the Muslims any more. If they wish to go on their own, we would let them go. But we shall not force them to leave. They are in their own houses. They are not in a majority. Why should we become cowards and harass them? We are free. The whole country is free. Why should they be under the impression that we are going to devour them? Are the Muslims such creatures that the Hindus can devour them if they are available? The Congress has made so much sacrifice. Year after year it has been making highest sacrifices which involved a large number of Hindus and Muslims. Have they all been possessed by some madness now after freedom? Shall we throw away in our intoxication that freedom which has come after so many sacrifices? How shameful it is! I would not tell you these things if you get excited after reading the news in the Press and think that they can never belong to you. I told you
 yesterday that the whole trouble can be stopped. How can it be done? We must purify ourselves. Purifying ourselves means being courageous. A person who can be courageous would not indulge in such activities. You have the support of your Government. The Government looks after the administration of the country. Gone are the days of the British Government when we could not refer our problems to it. Today you have your own Government. We can tell the Government how it should go about settling these  things.  After all,
there are only 4libtech_689_footnotelibtech_690_footnotecrores Muslims in the country. Why should we be
scared of them? Suppose you kill 4libtech_691_footnotecrores Muslims, what would you
 do after that? And there are so many Muslims in Pakistan. Whom would you kill there? The Pakistanis would like to settle accounts  with
you for those 4libtech_692_footnotecrores Muslims here. You would not be   able   to
 accept that challenge, because they would have the support of the whole world. That is why I say that we should remain pure. Let us keep our accounts clear. Let us not be in the position of debtors. If we are in the position of creditors, I tell you that your Government will have to give ultimatum to Pakistan. All the Hindus and Sikhs who have come from there have to go back and Pakistan would have to look after them. Pakistan has gone to the extent of saying that all the minority communities in Pakistan will enjoy the same rights as the Muslims. They will enjoy freedom of expression and worship, of visiting temples and gurdwaras. They will of course not enjoy and political power. I can very well understand that our mutual trust is shaken. But does the remedy lie in driving out the Muslims who are here with their properties, homes and children? That should not happen. It would be great cowardice. I want to tell you only this thing that we must abandon the idea of taking revenge on the Muslims. And we must so strengthen our hearts that the whole of Hindustan is convinced that nothing is going to happen in Delhi. But some things have happened in Delhi. The Muslims have been driven out. I do not say that those who have gone away should be brought back. But those who have stayed behind should be allowed to live in peace. Later on we can bring back the people who have gone away. If any Muslim misbehaves, report the matter to the Government. Those Muslims must accept the authority of the Government. If the Government permits you to kill them saying that it has no army, that Government has got to end. That means allowing goondaism to carry the day, which is not the function of a government. I want to tell you that you can influence
 
 the Government as much as you can. But do not take the law into your hands, do not use your guns and do not kill anyone. If you do this much, victory will be ours, and our ship which is beginning to sink will be saved. God is always on the side of truth. God can never abandon us but if we give up God, if we forget Him and abandon the right path, what can God do?

  IMPLICATIONS OFFASTINGlibtech_693_footnote 
 A friend writes :
 It seems to me that to put your life in jeopardy has become the final and natural remedy for you. Be that as it may, I cannot help thinking that the remedy is akin to keeping a patient alive by administering injections or oxygen to him.
The above reflection proceeds from pain due to affection.
 Nevertheless, I must say that the writer has not given much thought to his criticism. Many other well-wishers probably entertain the same hasty opinion. Hence this public discussion.
 The critic’s simile is inapplicable. Administration of injections or oxygen are outward remedies, calculated merely to prolong bodily existence. Therefore, they are properly described as of momentary value. Nothing will be lost if those remedies were not applied. A physical body cannot be made immortal. All that medical skill can do is to prolong the existence for a while. This temporary prolongation confers no lasting benefit.
 On the other hand, fasting is never intended to affect another’s body. It must affect his heart. Hence it is related to the soul. And in this sense the effect, such as it is, cannot be described as temporary. It is of a permanent character. Whether the fasting person is spiritually fit for the task and whether he has properly applied the remedy is a different matter, irrelevant to the present purpose.
 Of all the fasts of which I have recollection, of onelibtech_694_footnoteonly it can be said that though there was no fault in the conception it was alloyed with external remedy with contraindication. Had this mistake not been made, I have no doubt that its natural, beneficial result would have
 
 flown from it as in the others. I refer to the fast I had undertaken in Rajkot against the late Thakore Saheb. I saw my mistake, retraced my step and averted a dangerous crisis. The last was in Calcutta in the current month of September.libtech_695_footnoteAdmittedly the result was as it should have been. Having reference to the spirit, I regard it as permanent. Time alone would show whether the effect was of a lasting character or not. It must depend upon the purity of the fasting person and the accuracy of his perception. That enquiry would be irrelevant here. Moreover, the fasting man is not competent to undertake the enquiry. It can only be done by a properly equipped immpartial person and that too after my death.

 CHI. SHANTIKUMAR,
 There are many Harijans in Sind. They are in great distress and are faced with starvation. They should be transferred to Kathiawar. If, therefore, your Company sends over a ship or two to bring them over free of charge to some port in Kathiawar, their safety can be ensured. It is doubtful just now whether they will be able to preserve their religion or save the honour of their womenfolk. Bapa will see you with this letter. Please do this immediately, if possible. You may show this letter to Walchandbhailibtech_696_footnotelibtech_697_footnoteor any others in your Company with whom you   feel   like   sharing   it.

After what the Acharya 	had told 	him, he said, 	he, in 	fact, felt 	all the more 	strongly that the place 	of Sind 	Congress leaders at that 	juncture was in 	Sind.

My frank advice to one who is a Minister is not to come to the
  	Working Committee. Profulla Babu cannot leave Calcutta even for a 	day in the present circumstances. But these who listens to me? Mine 	is a lone voice. Mathai Saheblibtech_704_footnotelibtech_705_footnotesays 	that we shall have to take permission from the Pakistan Government 	to run more trains and they talk of stopping the trains altogether. 	I totally disapprove of the exchange of populations. Let us declare 	war. We shall fight and die fighting if we are destined to. They 	have abducted and molested 12-year-old girls. What does that 	indicate?  	Go through Kunzru’s statementlibtech_706_footnoteof this very day. Whatever it be, my advice to all of 	you is not to bother about me. I am here in Delhi and shall do what 	I can. This is an open secret. Even in the prayers I have said that 	today I am alone [in my mission].  	It is a sad state of affairs that Rajendra Babulibtech_707_footnotehas  to  look  to Australia for food. I don’t feel 	that we have won freedom. Should Hindustan known as the land of gold 	beg food from abroad? I feel very much pained about all this. If I 	had my way I would tell the people to die of hunger or else work 	hard [to produce food] but not a single grain should be imported 	from outside.  	If peace is not established here, the whole of Hindustan will be on 	fire and I will not be able to do anything about it. I keep thinking 	where I stand in all this. I have come here and am doing something 	but I feel I have become useless now. Today power is in our hands 	but I would be the biggest fool if I thought that I alone am right. 	But I would like it if none of you bothered to see me, much less 	consult me.  I shall be put on trial only if Ghanshyamdas asks me to 	quit. See if I can live in a hut. I work fully aware of my own 	limitations.  	It is possible that someone might molest my girls. But if the girls 	are brave they will die but will not allow anyone to molest them. 	You can notify the Pakistan Government that if they  persist  in  	such anarchy you will take matters in your own hands. In the Boer 	War the Boers were just a handful but they were not afraid to die. I 	have spent       
  years 	amongst those brave people. Shall 	we come 	to our 	senses only 	after the goondas 	usurp our 	place? I 	advise you 	and Choithram to 	go to Sind and die if 	need be. 
 I have become useless because I cannot make the Pakistan authorities do the right thing. But if normalcy is restored in Delhi I would like to go and die there. I am not being arrogant when I say that I know the art of dying but I have the courage to say it. But God alone knows if I will run away when I am being shot at or attacked with knives or will get angry with the attacker. If this happens then also there is no harm because the people will come to know that the man they looked upon as a Mahatma was not a true Mahatma. I too shall come to know where I stand. It is possible that I may still utter ‘Rama Rama’ when I am shot at or attacked. Let the outcome be either; ultimately it will be for good.

  TALK WITH REFUGEESlibtech_708_footnote 
 Thursday, September 25, 1947 GANDHIJI: I am doing my level best. And if you wish Delhi to prosper, Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Parsis should live as one. Even
if you are sore, why should you take revenge upon your brothers?
 Whatever is to be done should be done by the Government. Ask me what you wish to. I am not going to make a speech.
 A REFUGEE: I am an advocate from Montgomery. I saw more than two hundred women and children being surrounded by a [Muslim] mob. One of them killed an old man and then sat on his chest. I have come after witnessing such things there, and here too the condition is the same. I am a votary of non-violence. The pity is that Muslims cannot live with Hindus. This is not a new thing. It has been so for the last so many years. Now their goal is: “Hanske liya Pakistan, larke lenge Hindustan.”libtech_709_footnoteIt is high time the Hindus here took sides clearly. Will the Muslims remain loyal to Hindustan?
The question is apt. Many Hindu and Sikh brothers tell me the
 
 same. There was a time when the Congress was popular. Today if it does not adhere to its policy it will be finished.
 If the Muslims are not loyal Islam will disappear from the face of the earth. One who is prepared to die for the sake of his faith and dies when the time comes is a true man. Why shouldn’t one die bravely rather than die a lingering death of sickness and paralysis? Suppose Maulana Saheb comes to me with a sword commanding me to read the Kalma or face death at his hands; I would prefer to die then. I would dance if such an occasion arose.
 Every day Muslims come here to meet me. Many people have told me that they are traitors. But treachery does not pay. What will they gain by deceiving me? I don’t have a single pie. Even if a few of the four-and-a-half crores have arms they can do nothing. How can we govern our country if we live in fear? The world will not tolerate your killing your brothers. Today the world has become small. There are atom bombs which can wipe out a city like London within five or six minutes. Hindus are a mere speck on the earth. If the Muslims turn traitors, the Government will shoot them down. It is sheer barbarity to stab them stealthily.
 Last night I could not sleep at all. It was raining and I was thinking about the plight of the refugees. Indians are said to be mercy incarnate. Will they lose their name? Newspaper correspondents from abroad laugh at us and all of them report that India is utterly impoverished. There is nothing to eat and drink. It is time we took this warning and became human.
I have told you all that I wished to. Now you can do as you wish.
 A SIKH: I have my business in Pakistan. I am coming from there. If even five per cent of the Hindus can return to and stay in Pakistan, then we shall somehow accommodate 95 per cent Muslims here.
 I won’t be satisfied with five per cent. I can rest in peace only after each and every one of them can stay fearlessly where they wish to. If you can make Delhi peaceful, I wish to go to Pakistan also. Of course I cannot revive the dead, but those who are left can certainly settle there once again. Can you see Punja Saheb turned into a  mosque? I would much rather die. All is well with you if you learn the art of dying. Then all of you have to go back to your own places and I shall die here. If you wish to seek my advice, I can only say that all those Muslims who have left out of fear should come back and settle
 here again. If Pakistan does not become paklibtech_710_footnote, it will perish on its own. At the moment all of you are full of anger.
 A REFUGEE: The Congress has already committed one blunder. Now it will commit another. Hindus and Muslims will never be able to stay together. Lakhs of our people are starving and naked. But nothing has been done for them. How many weapons have been surrendered up to now? How can we trust such people? We wish that the houses vacated by the Muslims should be given to us. There is an agreement between the two Governments that they should not make searches. Still the Pakistan Government continues to make them and our Government is doing nothing about it. The Pakistan Government is taking advantage of this situation. There the people are getting thousands of licences and arms and here we have been forced to surrender them. We are happy that Muslims can settle in Delhi. But if you come over to Pakistan with us and help us to get back our things, we do not wish to stay in Delhi even for a day. Nothing will be done till you decide to pay them back in their own coin. Today we are without a roof. The condition of women and children is terrible.
What you say is really pathetic. You are right in saying that you
 do not wish to stay here. Go to [Rawal]pindi. Here the Government is my friend. What can I do if I do not know the Pakistan Government? But you should understand that I am using all the strength and energy that I have. It is up to you to believe this. Here they are thinking of setting up a new city. But I am not a minister. I am doing as much as a human being can. I am just an ordinary man like you. It is a matter of shame for India to think of throwing out four-and-a-half crore Muslims. It is not practical to do so. I cannot say that all the arms have been surrendered to me. But that is not of much importance. Arms can never protect anyone. Try to understand this if you can. You will not hear anything besides this from me. I will only say ‘die but do not kill’ and I shall die saying this.

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 
 
      BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  NEW DELHI,  September 	25, 1947 
  	We are faced with a sudden calamity. Our freedom is not even 	on-and-a-half months old. What can a child of a month and 10 days 	do? But we are strong and have been fighting against British 	imperialism till today. Are we going to bow down in the face of 	difficulties? Let us talk only about the post-independence period. 	It is not that we were not prepared for it. We did become free. But 	our people started thinking that freedom meant freedom to do 	anything they chose. With that attitude we have rendered the task of 	the Government very difficult. If a man cannot keep his hands clean, 	how can he see clean things and how far can he appreciate such 	things? When we have rogues amongst us, who would blame whom for 	being rogues? If anyone is straight away branded a rogue, the 	question becomes all the more complicated. This is no true freedom. 	Nor is this the way to win it. That is why I say that we should tell 	our Government that as far as possible we shall help it. Supposing 	the Government does not get such help, would we then start doing 	what has been done and is being done in Pakistan? Would that teach 	them a lesson? I tell you that is not the way to teach them a 	lesson. That is not the way things go on in the world. If people 	fight among themselves the Government would ask them to stop 	fighting. They would be told to seek the help of the police. If the 	police did not listen to them, they could go to the residence of the 	magistrate and report their case there. Whatever could possibly be 	done would be done there. If there were only some stray cases of 	fighting the magistrate could settle the dispute. But in this case 	there is confrontation between two large communities. What can the 	Government do? It is not the Government of the British receiving 	orders from Britain. Now the Government is yours. This means that 	you can order the Government not to do a particular thing. You can 	throw out that Government. Such is your power. If you do not use 	that power in the proper manner, you will find yourselves in great 	trouble. And, let me tell you, today we are in great danger. 	Pakistan is no doubt facing danger. But so are we. 
 In reply to thislibtech_711_footnotelibtech_712_footnoteI would merely say that it is our Government and it is doing what needs to be done. If something still remains to be done, that too would be taken up. I have told you where your duty lies. I do not wish to say anything more. What is your duty? It is to live together in amity and not to regard the Muslims as your enemies. Wrongdoers would automatically meet their own end. But if we consider any one individual as our enemy and beat him and kill him, it is cowardice on our part, and it has a weakening effect on us. Those who have courage and strength should not quarrel with  others. Because we fight only with those whom we do not trust. It is all futile. What is the point of fighting? God in them and in us is the same. I had told you that we were not the arbiters of our destiny. We are mere creatures in God’s hand. Only if God helps us can we protect our honour. Otherwise not. Plead with Him, not with man. Plead with Him who brings redemption to the fallen. He is right in our midst. When He is there to protect us, why should we be angry with anyone or be afraid? Let the Muslims do what they want, let them keep any number of arms, let them behave like scoundrels and let them be traitors. If they are traitors the Government will deal with them. Everywhere in the world traitors are shot down as a rule. If anybody becomes a traitor, he commits a great crime against the State. It is a crime greater even than murder. That is why traitors are shot down. I can understand that they may have become traitors. But killing them on suspicion of treason does not behove man. It is the work of a coward.
 I told you yesterday,libtech_713_footnoteand I am telling you today, that ours is a wrecked boat. It is quite true that God alone can bring it to the shore. But we also must make efforts. If the boat has a hole somewhere we must try to stop water coming in with whatever may be available to us. But I have seen that if water starts flowing into the boat, they throw it out with the same speed. The boat then continues to sail in spite of the leak. But this can happen only if God helps. With God’s grace it moves and reaches the shore, but if God does not help it sinks. That is why I would say that man should make effort and seek the help of God. There is a fire raging in Delhi. There is fire in other places too.
 
 Every place is burning. It is our duty to extinguish that fire, pour water over it, without which it cannot be put out. Our first task is to make the people understand [the situation]. I try to convince them as well as you in the same terms. I shall repeat the same thing to the whole world till my last breath. The glorious land that was India has become a cremation-ground today. It has become that barbarous.
 I am saying out of experience that our police and the army have to be the servants of the people and should not behave like masters. The days of officialdom are over. It is my way to get things done through love. I am pained to hear it being said that we have a Hindu army or a Punjabi army and that the Hindu police will slaughter the Muslims. I am also amused. If this should be so, I think the police and the military together would crush India and India’s ship would sink. Today we have our own army. I do not believe that the British people are all worthless. However, most of the British have already left. Only some officers are left behind. Granted that they are all worthless, though I do not believe they are. But if they are worthless, they have to go. Sopposing the army in Pakistan does something wrong, should the army in India do the same thing? Because the police in Pakistan does evil things, should our police also do the same? I wish to tell you this and warn you of the consequences. If all start behaving that way, India will be destroyed and our freedom, which is one month and ten days old, will not even complete two months. Let us not create such a situation. What should we do to avoid this? We must be courageous. We should not be afraid of anyone. We should be afraid only of God. Let us pray to God that He may carry our boat to the shore. The condition we have to fulfil is: Whatever may happen in Pakistan, whatever other people may do, let us keep our hearts clean. We must remember that if we do not do this, we shall all become monsters. We have to keep our India pure and clean and we must be tolerant. The Muslims have got to be loyal to India. If they are not loyal they must be shot. Can we do that ourselves? That is not our job. The Muslims are our brothers. They have got their homes and everything here. Hence we must realize that those who are staying here should live here by all means. Let there be no mutual fear. I would appeal to you to have faith, for faith generates faith and suspicion gives rise to  suspicion. Keep on strengthening your faith.

  DISCUSSION WITH H. S. SUHRAWARDY 
 [September 26, 1947]libtech_715_footnote
 GANDHIJI: Have you returned as the king of the forest or as a jackal?libtech_716_footnote
 SUHRAWARDY: Sir, only as a mouse. The mouse is a very discreet creature.
 GANDHIJI: Now, listen. Once there was a lion. He got caught in a hunter’s net. A mouse pursued by an owl from above  and  a  mongoose from below also ran into the net. “You give me protection, I shall set you free,” the mouse proposed to the lion. The lion agreed. The bargain was struck. The mongoose scuttled away. But the round, shining eyes of the owl were still riveted on his prey. “When are you going to begin?”, the lion impatiently asked the mouse. “Where is the hurry?”, the cunning mouse replied, “I shall set you free when the hunter appears on the scene.” And instead of setting the lion free, it crouched under his fur and had a quiet nap! The lion was furious, but what could he do? When the hunter appeared on the scene, the mouse unhurriedly gnawed at the net-strings and before the enraged lion could do anything, away the cunning creature scuttled for its own hole. You know ‘wily whiskers’ is a very treacherous creature. It
 bites you unawares while you are asleep. It is only when the blood comes out that you know of its presence. Is that how you are going to act?
 SUHRAWARDY: Sir, you know everything. So what can I say?

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING      NEW 	DELHI, 
  September 	26, 1947  BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,  	What is going on is not Sikhism, nor Islam nor Hinduism. We are 	somewhat familiar with each of these. Can any religion which 	indulges in unworthy things survive? Sikhism started with  Guru 	Nanak. What did Guru Nanak teach? He said that God is known by 	several names including Allah, Rahim, Khuda. This is so in all     
 religions. Nanak Saheb tried to bring together all religions. Kabir Saheb did the same thing. It is said that that age is gone.
 Today a man—Guru Duttlibtech_717_footnotelibtech_718_footnote—came to me. He is a big vaidya. As he narrated his tale he burst into tears. He agreed that in the light of the training he had received from me he should have laid down his life there. But he confessed he had not the courage to do so. He told me that he had always respected me and felt that what I said was the only right thing. But it was a different matter following truth in practice. He said the truth was that he was not able to carry it out in practice. He was prepared to go back if I said so. I told him that if we were convinced that we could never expect justice at the hands of the Pakistan Government and if they did not admit their mistakes then we had our own Cabinet which included Jawaharlal, Sardar Patel and many other good men. If even they cannot stop the Pakistan Government from indulging in those things, then ultimately they would have to resort to war. Let us arrive at a mutual and friendly settlement. Why can we not do so? We Hindus and Muslims were friends till yesterday. Have we become such enemies today that we cannot trust one another? If you say that you are never going to trust them, then the two sides would have to fight. Speaking in terms of logic it may be asked what else would people do when they have army and police and are forced to depend on them? If they decide to kill two persons for every person killes in Pakistan, who would care for whom? If we want to have justice, let me tell you the matter does not lie with you or me. It is the function of the Government. Tell the Government, it is there to help us. We should not take the offensive. But we must be ready to fight, because when war comes it does not come after giving a warning. We should not take any initiative to fight, but if the other side takes the initiative, both the Governments face their doom. War is no joke. After all, how long can I go on stressing the point? But if there is no settlement between the two sides, there would be no alternative. In that event, if all the Hindus have to die fighting, I would not be sorry. But we have to choose the path of
 justice. I would not bother if all the Hindus and all the Muslims have to die following that path. And, then, if it is proved that all those 4libtech_719_footnote
 
 
 crores Muslims are fifth-columnists, I have no doubt that they have to be shot down or executed. And like the Muslims, the Hindus and the Sikhs living in Pakistan too should be treated in the same manner; if they betray that country, we cannot be partial in their case. If we regard all the Muslims as fifth-columnists, will not the Hindus and the Sikhs in Pakistan be also considered fifth-columnists? That would not do. The Hindus and the Sikhs staying there can come here by all means if they do not wish to continue staying there. In that case, it is the first duty of the Indian Government to give them jobs and make their lives comfortable. But they cannot continue to stay there and become petty spies and work for us and not for Pakistan. Such a thing cannot be done and I would not be a party to it. I do not have any magic wand with me. Nor do I possess a sword. I have only one thing with me, and that is, to recite the name of God and work in the name of God. Everything is accomplished by following that path. It is not that I am the only one in possession of it. All of you, including that little girl standing there, possess it. God alone has  the  power  to perform miracles. What do you think I can do without the grace of God? But this much I have realized. I have been a fighter for many many years, more than 60 years. But I fight not with the sword, but with the weapons of truth and non-violence. Those weapons are still with us. But it is not within my power alone to use them. I can do nothing without your support.
 We are going to preserve our freedom with the strength with which we have won it. We defeated the British with that strength. We did not defeat them with the help of arms. Ours was the unarmed power with which we defeated them. Whoever wants to live in India, whether Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Christian, will have to fight and die for India. If all the Indians would lay down their lives for the country, no power could defeat us or push us back, irrespective of the army we may or may not have. The Muslims have said they would be loyal to India. Let us trust them with all our heart. Let us remember that truth alone triumphs never untruth,—Satyameva jayate nanritamlibtech_720_footnote. This is a great saying. It contains the essence of our religion. Let us learn it by heart and always remember it. And then I would say and say with all
 
 the force at my command that we would stand firm even if the whole world was against us. No one can kill us. No one can destroy  Hinduism. If it is destroyed, it would be at our own hands. Similarly if Islam is destroyed in India, it would be at the hands of the Muslims living in Pakistan. It cannot be destroyed by the Hindus.

 APPENDICDSES
 APPENDIX I
 LORD MOUNTBATTEN’S NOTE ON INTERVIEW WITH GANDHIJIlibtech_722_footnote
 July 9, 1947 I think and hope that I have satisfactorily cleared up the misunderstanding referred to in his letter of the 27/28th June, 1947. I told him that my sole object up to
 15th August was to ensure a peaceful and efficient transfer of power to the two Dominions in accordance with the will of the people of India and their respective future Governments. He next raised with me the fear which he had expressed consistently in his recent post-prayer meetings that the British would leave a legacy of war, and that the partitioned armies would be left in a state in which there was every likelihood that they would be used for making war on each other.
  I 	told him that of 	course I 	shared his 	view that nothing should 	be left 	undone which would ensure 	the removal of 	the threat of 	 war  between  two neighbouring 	members of the 	British Commonwealth.  I 	told him in confidence  that 	 Lord  Ismay  was  this 	 day  seeing 	 the British Chiefs of 	Staff to discuss the future Commonwealth defence arrangements with 	particular reference to India. While I could not prophesy what would 	be the outcome of those 	discussions, I hoped 	that they would 	result in defence 	discussions between the 	United Kingdom, Pakistan 	and India taking 	place after the 15th 	August and 	before 31st March.  I 	pointed out 	that the institution of 	the Joint 	Defence Council, which 	would last 	until at 	least that 	date, would remove all 	risk of war 	before that 	date, and 	that this gave us eight 	months in which 	to arrange 	some form of 	agreement which 	would reduce the chances of the two countries fighting each other.  I 	pointed out 	that the 	greatest guarantee for 	the future peace of 	the Indian 	Sub-Continent lay 	in both nations remaining 	members of the British Commonwealth. He 	reproved me 	for using 	the word ‘nations’ 	and invited 	me to use 	States or 	Countries instead.  I 	further pointed out 	that so long 	as Pakistan 	and India remained 	within the 	Commonwealth, there 	was no reason 	why a 	Commonwealth Conference 	should not 	be called to Delhi since 	this was 	the most central 	capital in 	the whole Commonwealth, and at such a meeting arrangements could be discussed which would 
 
 ensure other members of the Commonwealth devising means to prevent Pakistan and India from making war on each other.
  We 	next discussed 	the question 	of the 	Indian States. He 	asked me 	to do everything 	in my power to ensure 	that the 	British did 	not leave 	a legacy of 	Balkanization and 	disruption on 	the 15th August by 	encouraging the 	States to 	declare their 	independence, or 	by leaving the 	arrangements between 	the States and 	the Dominions 	of India 	and Pakistan 	in a state 	of chaos.  He 	further went on 	and said that H. 	E. H.’s decision about 	Berar returning to 	the Nizam was a crime.  I 	told him 	that I 	had already invited H. 	E. H.’s representatives 	to meet 	me on 	the 11th to 	discuss the 	questions of 	Berar and 	Secunderabad. I 	told him 	that on 	the 25th 	July all States including 	Hyderabad would send 	representatives to 	discuss the 	stand-still agreement, 	and I 	hoped also the 	terms under which they 	would join one or 	the other dominion.  I 	told him that since 	Pandit Nehru had 	authorized me 	to negotiate in 	the first 	instance alone with the 	States’ representatives 	on the 	basis of 	their being 	granted full 	membership of 	the dominion 	on adhering 	only to 	the three Central 	subjects mentioned in the 	Cabinet Mission Plan, I 	felt very hopeful 	of being 	able to 	bring in 	almost every State 	including even Travancore.  I 	made it 	a condition 	however that 	no leaders must make any 	more threatening or 	provocative speeches.  I 	told Mr. Gandhi 	“You always 	talk about 	wooing people, and yet in 	the case 	of the States you threaten. Would you woo a girl you wanted to marry 	with a stick and expect 	her to 	accept?” He 	laughed and 	admitted the 	truth of this 	statement, and 	said he 	would make no 	statements that would 	embarrass my negotiations.

 APPENDIX II
 LORD MOUNTBATTEN’S NOTE ON INTERVIEW WITH GANDHIJIlibtech_723_footnote
 July 29, 1947
 I explained that I had called this meeting to consider Pandit Nehru’s projected visit to Kashmir. I recalled the history of this affair from the time I arrived, and said
 
 
 that Pandit Nehru had from the very beginning repeatedly expressed to me his strong desire to visit Kashmir which I understood was based on the incidents that occurred there during the visit of the Cabinet Mission last year. I expressed sincere sympathy with Pandit Nehru’s mental distress at having been unable to keep his promise to visit his friends in Kashmir and endeavour to effect the release of Sheikh Abdulla.
 I reminded the meeting that it had been agreed that Mr. Gandhi should visit Kashmir in place of Pandit Nehru if this was generally thought to be a better solution
 : and I took the full blame for having delayed this visit by offering to go myself to Kashmir. I repeated my regret at having been unable to discuss the release of Sheikh Abdulla with the Maharaja on the last day of my visit owing to His Highness’s indisposition. I admitted having asked Mr. Gandhi to wait until the arrival of the Prime Minister of Kashmir, Pandit Kak. But I said I was at a loss to understand how, consequent on Pandit Kak’s visit to both Mr. Gandhi and Pandit Nehru to ask neither of them to go, the result should have been that Pandit Nehru wished to go instead of Mr. Gandhi.
 Whatever Pandit Nehru’s personal emotions might be, I felt I should be failing in my duty if I did not point our that this was hardly the time for the Vice-President of the Interim Government and the Prime Minister of the Dominion Government which was to take over power in 17 days, to leave the capital on what really amounted to almost private business; at all events on a visit which it would be extremely difficult  to explain away to world opinion.
 I also pointed out that a visit by any Congress leaders could not fail to be badly received in the world Press just at the time it was known that Kashmir had the choice of Pakistan or India before its Ruler; but that this effect would be somewhat mitigated if Mr. Gandhi  went  on  account  of  the  religious  aura  that  surrounded  him, whereas if Pandit Nehru went it would be regarded as a piece of straightforward political lobbying.
 Mr. Gandhi agreed with what I had said, and stated that although at Mr. Kak’s request he had agreed not to go, if I seriously regarded Pandit Nehru’s proposed visit as objectionable, he would himself be prepared once more to take his place.
 Sardar Patel gave it as his view that neither of them should go, but that in view of Pandit Nehru’s great mental distress if his mission in Kashmir were to remain unfulfilled, he agreed that one of them must go. He very bluntly remarked : “It is a choice between two evils and I consider that Gandhiji’s visit would be the lesser evil.”
 Pandit Nehru held forth at some length about his mental distress and defended
 his visit on the grounds that (A) nothing would be more natural than that Congress should send a high-level emissary to lay before the Government of Kashmir the advantages of joining the Dominion of India, and (B) that it was well known that he was over-worked, that he would like to go away for three or four days’ rest somewhere  in any case, and that Kashmir would be a delightful place in which to have a brief holiday. The fact that he might be engaged on local work would be a sufficient change  of occupation to give him the necessary rest.
 The rest of us each argued in turn with Pandit Nehru and finally Mr. Gandhi specifically renewed his offer to go provided Pandit Nehru would accept that offer, which he urged him to do since Sardar Patel and I, who were the two “outside” members of the party, were so strongly in favour of Gandhi’s going.
 Finally it was agreed that Mr. Gandhi should leave on the following night train via Rawalpindi and that I would send telegrams to the Resident in Kashmir and the Governor of the Punjab.libtech_724_footnote

 APPENDIX III
 INTERVIEW WITH LORD MOUNTBATTENlibtech_725_footnote
 NEW  DELHI,
 September 14 and 16, 1947
 I spoke to him about the increasing tendency of responsible leaders and Ministers to become communal in outlook. He agreed that his was so.
 I told him that I thought that only the Prime Minister himself was completely free from the taint of communalism. Maulana Azad, for a Muslim, was of course remarkably free of bias; though it must be remembered that he was in a peculiar situation. I did not know whether Kidwai could be regarded as quite free, though he had shown no signs of communalism. Matthai and Rajkumari still seemed fairly free; but Bhabha was a disappointment since he had been selected specially as Chairman of the Delhi Emergency Committee not only for his business efficiency and strong personality, but because as a Parsee he should be non-communal. I was informed, however, that in the last two days he appeared to have gone completely communal.
 
 I told Mr. Gandhi that it was not a bit of good preaching to the people unless he had converted the leaders; and I urged him to devote his full energy towards keeping the leaders, and particularly the Deputy Prime Minister, as straight as possible.
 Mr. Gandhi said he entirely agreed with every word I had spoken; that he already knew it, and that he was interested to see that I had summed up the position so correctly.
 He promised to do his very best, and offered never to mention my name in this matter or that we had these conversations.
 He complained bitterly about the wording of Mr. Jinnah’s appeal for money, since it was apparently intended only to help Muslims wherever they might be and not the people of Pakistan. He asked me if I could take this up with Mr. Jinnah personally, and I told him I did not feel I should be right in doing this, but I would ask Lord Ismay to take it up the next time he visited Karachi.

 APPENDIX IV
 
 INTERVIEW WITH LORD MOUNTBATTENlibtech_726_footnote
 NEW  DELHI,
 September 25, 1947
 Mr. Gandhi broke in with a wise observation. He pointed out that the mere refutation of Pandit Kunzru’s remarkslibtech_727_footnote, particularly by Nehru (who was now suspect for not being sufficiently communal on the Hindu/Sikh side) or by himself (whose remarks were becoming more and more obnoxious to the people of India), would not effect the main purpose we had in mind of checking the spread of this anti-British feeling among Indians.
 He therefore considered it of overriding importance that Pandit Kunzru should be immediately recalled to Delhi; should be confronted with his statement; should be asked to substantiate it; and, on failing to do so, should be called upon to make an unqualified apology and unhesitating withdrawal. This would have a really profound effect as in the Gokhale case of 1896.
 
 
 Mr. Gandhi suggested that Gen. Thimayya should either see Pandit Kunzru, in view of their friendship and the unique position he was in to convince him of the truth; or at the very least should leave a full personal letter behind for him to read.
 Pandit Nehru here pointed out a complication, in that Pandit Kunzru was really attacking the whole of the present Government and not merely the British; and that it might be difficult to separate the two. I, however, urged that the British case was the more pressing and that it should be grappled with strength at this moment.
 Mr. Gandhi went on to say that he was perfectly prepared to support this line at the proper moment by elaborating it in his post-prayer meeting discussions. He also offered to see Mr. Birla (his present host), who owned The Hindustan Times,  and  to talk to his son, Devdas Gandhi, the editor, to try and ensure that in the mean while the right line was taken up in this newspaper. I urged that he should also invite his son to use his influence with the editor of the Indian News Chronicle. Mr. Gandhi said that he thought Sahni had left, but no doubt his son would be able to make contact with the new editor.
 The rest of the party then left, and I remained alone with Mr. Gandhi.
 He told me that the time had come when I must consider what action
 I should take to help in the present position if I did not wish to bury my own reputation and even the reputation of the British here in India where at present it stood so high.
 So far as I could make out his idea was that I should telegraph to Mr. Attlee in my personal capacity as an Englishman and say that the British Commonwealth should not hesitate to expel any member of that Commonwealth which could be proved guilty of sharp practice and which intended to make war on another member.
 He was not saying this against Pakistan, for the rest of the Commonwealth might come to the conclusion that it was India, though he himself felt certain that they would not.
 He did not see how the rest of the Commonwealth could support two members in their midst which were drifting towards a stage that sooner or later might mean war. For instance, he considered that it was most unfortunate that Sir Francis
 Mudie, Sir George Cunningham and Sir Frederick Bourne should be Governors of
 Pakistan provinces at this time.
 I asked him whether he believed Nishtar, Ghazanfar Ali and Chundrigar would prove a greater deterrent to war if they had been Governors.
 To my surprise Mr. Gandhi replied that he would prefer to see them as Governors now, for then the full duplicity and hostile intent of Pakistan would stand
 revealed in all its nakedness, whereas now they were covering up their intentions behind a facade of honourable British Governors.
 I said I assumed that Mr. Gandhi quite understood that in the event of a war between the Dominions, British officers would be withdrawn from both Dominions immediately, since they could hardly be expected to fight each other. I further pointed out that this sanction acted 90 per cent against Pakistan, for it was they who were short of senior officers and administrators and it was they who would be crippled  by the removal of the British; whereas in India, though in my opinion they would lose great efficiency, they would not be crippled in the same way. Mr. Gandhi agreed.
 I told Mr. Gandhi I could not possibly communicate with Mr. Attlee behind Pandit Nehru’s back and I would require to show him what I proposed to send and would need his full approval.
 “Ah!”, said Mr. Gandhi, “I am afraid you may have difficulty there; for though I agree you must do that, he has already refused to accept my suggestion of including this proposal in his reply to the Prime Minister on the question of the Pakistan telegrams to the Commonwealth.”
 I now felt we were in such deep water, and the point was so very unclear, and as the time was now past 2 p. m., that it was better to let him go and ask him to put up his proposals in writing to me, which he promised to do.
