(3) How far should we pay regard to social practice or custom in the path of satyagraha? (4) What would be my duty as a satyagrahi when I disagree with a renowned mahatma like you on a certain step which I find to be right according to the voice of my conscience and which might violate the rules of the institution? (5) Should one love the individual for the sake of the institution or the institution for the individual? (6) By what test can one find out that one has bad thoughts about others? (7) If a person is found on every occasion telling lies, or shirking work or being selfish, and others too have complained about it, would it be proper for a satyagrahi to have doubts about him? (8) What is the limit for simple living? To embroider one’s sari, to wear fashionable blouses, to adorn the hands and neck with flowers, wear chappals —should this be considered as love for art  or breaking the Ashram principles? (9) Would it be slander or violence if in the Ashram one person finds fault with another and commits the same fault himself, i.e., indulges in mutual fault-finding? (10) As those who join the Ashram do so with different motives, should we judge each of them from his own standpoint?"

As a result of this the orthodox sections of the village had 	ostracized them and the barber and the washerman had refused to 	serve them.

libtech_187_footnote,"1Gandhiji had 	added this 	to the 	letter dated May 	21, 1933, from 	Mathuradas Trikumji 	to Mirabehn 	which read: “. . 	. It is not 	yet 7 a.m. 	Bapu is fast 	asleep in 	the porch 	facing the Yeravda 	Central Prison. And I 	am writing 	these lines from a 	corner from where I 	constantly have 	a look 	at him. 	He lies 	in his 	cot like a 	sweet child; 	beaming with 	brightness. None 	who looks merely at 	his face can believe 	that he 	has not 	touched food 	all these 	13 days. 	All is 	going on 	smoothly. He 	is now taking 	Sinhagad water—a place 	famous in the history 	of Maharashtra. 	He himself 	stayed for   a 	few days in 	that fortress in 	1920. He 	likes it 	very much and 	the historic associations 	of the 	place have drawn him 	towards it 	and its water. 	Dr. Dinshaw 	Mehta who nurses 	him has a 	branch of 	his clinic 	there and it 	is he who is 	responsible for 	securing water 	from there. He 	with his fiancee 	is rendering 	splendid service to Bapu. 	Bapu enjoys peace 	of mind 	and is 	attaining more and 	more the 	spirit of 	detachment. Mahadevbhai 	has gone 	yesterday to the 	Ashram. Bapu has 	added himself these lines 	without specs and 	hence duplication of 	letters. The 	letter was 	about to 	be posted when he 	asked for 	it. N.B. I am writing you 	daily without fail, and Mahadev wrote to you yesterday. Your last 	letter is dated 	May 19, 1933.”"

But it would seem that you are opposed to withdrawing civil disobedience except on conditions and that the interview you seek with His Excellency is for the purpose of initiating negotiations with Government regarding these conditions. It also appears to have been decided that unless Congress reaches a settlement with Government as a result of such discussions civil disobedience will be resumed on first August. It is hardly necessary to remind you that the position of Government is that the civil disobedience movement is wholly unconstitutional that there can be no compromise with it and that Government cannot enter into any negotiations for its withdrawal. On April twenty-ninth nineteen hundred and thirty two the Secretary of State stated in the House of Commons that there would be no question of making a bargain with Congress as a condition of its co-operation. The same position has been consistently maintained by Government in numerous subsequent statements. If the Congress desires to resume its position as a consitutional party and to put an end to a movement which has brought grave injury and suffering to the country the way is open to it as it always has been. It is within the power of the Congress to restore peace by withdrawing on its own initiative the civil disobedience movement. As however the Congress is not willing to take that action an interview with His Excellency would be to no purpose.”"
