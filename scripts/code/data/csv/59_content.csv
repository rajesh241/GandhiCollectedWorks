 Whatever is always followed by the learned, the good and those who are free from anger and attachment and whatever is experienced in the heart, know that to be religion.libtech_398_footnote
Another text is, again, from the same Code:"
2,"February 	13, 1933","| 
||","
 Steadfastness, forgiveness, restraint, non-stealing, purity, control of the senses, intelligence, learning, truth, freedom from anger, these ten are the touchstone of religion.libtech_399_footnote
 Accordingly, whatever is clearly contrary to  this  touchstone must be rejected as an interpolation.
 The Pandit has summarilÁŸy dismissed the ideals of Hinduism about equality and justice, by regardiÁfng them as the  private  property of the saints, forgetting that ideals and saints  become perfectly useless if the practice of the poor sinners can never approach the ideals and their repositories, the saints. What is that justice “which will not condone invidious distinction between man and man but will make us face the stern reality and admit the necessity of differential treatment between different castes and classes of people”? Who are the different castes and what is the differential treatment  between them? For instance, among the Banias, whom I should know best, there are about 50 castes. I know of no differential treatment between them. Nor do I find any authority for the formation of these castes in the Smritis. There are as many castes among the Brahmins as there are leaves in the little tree under which I am sitting, but I do not find any Smriti which enumerates these castes and the differential treatment. I
 
 have a shrewd suspicion that these gentlemen will fight to the last ditch any attempt made to mete out differential treatment to them, and some of them may even, like my non-Brahmin friends, consign  to  the flames Sanskrit verses printed and stitched together and passed off as divinely inspired Smritis.
The Pandit says:
 The best way, therefore, of rising superior to the stigma of social inferiority is not enfranchisement, but emancipation from the snare of the dark forces of Nature.
Who is to be emancipated from the snare of the dark forces of
 Nature? Evidently the Pandit means that it is not the Brahmin who has to emancipate himself from the snare of superiority, but the poor Harijan has to disengage himself from the snare of inferiority. Unfortunately, that is precisely what the modern sanatanist Brahmin is resisting, and that is precisely what Dr. Ambedkar demands almost at the point of the bayonet. For, he says, ‘the dark forces of Nature shall no longer hold me in their snare. I shall rise to the same height that the Brahmin occupies, even though I may have to demolish both him and myself in the attempt.,’ Yet that is the net result of the Pandit’s prescription.
 As against the Pandit’s, my humble prescription is that it is the Brahmin whose privilege and duty it is to disentangle himself from the snare of superiority and himself become a ‘Harijan’ man of God,. Then only will he vindicate the glory of varnadharma and the true message of Hinduism, for which he is supposed ‘‘to live, move and have his being”. I invite the Pandit to appreciate this very simple prescription.
 Lastly, he has done himself and me less than justice by misreading the scope of the referendum suggested by me. Surely, worshippers in a temple have at any time the right to admit others to worship with them on the same terms as they themselves do, so long as they do not interfere with the ceremonial or the mode of worship, which undoubtedly can only be regulated by experience.
 Let us know this ancient practice by its own ancient name, and perhaps it will cease to frighten the Pandit, and  other  orthodox friends. Have  not  Mahajans  always  decided  matters  of  admission to temples? And Mahajans are assemblies of men and they decide by putting their heads together and taking the sense of the meeting. I presume that this would be described as a referendum in the English language. I have suggested nothing more and nothing less than this.
 Harijan, 25-2-1933
   THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD  
 I wrote to the Rt. Hon. Srinivasa Sastri for a message to the Harijan. And I received a characteristic reply marked ‘private’. The letter seemed to me to be too good to be suppressed. I, therefore, wired for permission to publish it. The reply wire was as characteristic as the letter.
 Firstly inappropriate to Harijan, secondly, offensive to partisans. Ill requital for your steadfast affection. However if perchance useful please publish.
And here is the letter:
 Private
 
        DEAR 	BROTHER,  SVAGATAM,MYLAPORE,  February 	13, 1933 
  Thanks 	for your affectionate letter, in which you ask for a message to your 	new baby.  I 	am going to change towards you. It is necessary in your interest, no 	matter what effort it costs me.  You 	live in a 	difficult world. Waking 	or dreaming, 	you are racked 	by thoughts 	of sin 	and penance, confessions 	and truth-quests, 	satyagraha and moral 	self-flagellation. Those 	that talk to 	you or correspond with 	you continually pose 	doubts and 	serious problems, only 	deepening the 	grimness and 	suffocation around you. 	Few bring lightness of 	talk, familiar 	expletives, innocent 	jokes, revealing banter. You 	badly need a privileged 	jester in your 	establishment. Have 	you read a story 	called Ardath by Ouida? 	The hero there 	has a 	critic whose business is 	to expose his 	errors and 	bring to 	light the 	flaws  in 	his character. 	Being a professional 	fault-finder, he overdoes 	his part in 	the end 	and defeats his 	first object. I 	shall vary my 	function from time to 	time and 	disappear from the scene 	every now and then. 	But I 	will endeavour to 	awaken parts of 	your mind long gone to 	sleep and 	to supply 	elements of nourishment 	which it 	has long 	been without. Of 	course, you 	can stop the 	medicine if 	it disagrees 	and you cannot 	stand it. That 	would be a sign 	to me that 	the disease 	had gone 	too far.  You 	are an extraordinarily correct writer of English. The ordinary 	reader will not detect any slips on your part. They are not only 	rare but of a subtle nature. The eye of a schoolmaster, made acute 	by dwelling on trivialities of 
 grammar, can alone see them. Here are some, all from the first number of the
 Harijan and from the parts bearing your name.
 Page 3. “If it is a bye-product of the caste system, it is only in the same sense that an ugly growth is of a body”. (‘That’ is fast undergoing a change in English, but this use is far in excess of present usage. Better say ‘in which  an ugly growth is a bye-product of a body’.)
 Also read the whole passage again. Don’t you say in effect ‘if the caste system is a bye-product of the caste system’?
 Page 3. “The outcaste-ness, in the sense we understand it, has therefore to be destroyed altogether.” (A slip similar to the above. Between ‘sense’ and ‘we’ insert ‘in which’.)
 Page 4. “Caste Hindus have to open their temples to Harijans, precisely on the same terms as the other Hindus.,,
 (Say ‘the same terms as to the other Hindus’. Else, it would mean that the other Hindus opened their temples on certain terms to Harijans.)libtech_400_footnote
 Page 7. “Beyond this I may not go, for the reason I have already stated and which the reader should respect.” (Insert ‘which’ after ‘reason’. The conjunction ‘and’ must not be made to connect a suppressed ‘which’ and an expressed ‘which’.)
 Page 8. “Untouchability has a great deal to answer for the insanitation of our streets and our latrines.” (Idiomatically, ‘for’ is part of the verb ‘answer’, and cannot govern ‘the insanitation’. We must insert ‘in’ after ‘for’, though the sentence becomes inelegant. I would recast it: ‘Untouchability is answerable for a great deal of the insanitation etc.’).
 Page 8. “Therefore, a person who is to attend to scavenging, whether it is a paid Bhangi or an unpaid mother, they are unclean until they have washed themselves clean of their unclean work.”
 (The looseness is, perhaps, the result of rapid dictation unchecked by
 subsequent reading. ‘A person’ is left hanging in the air. The plurals ‘they’, ‘themselves’ and ‘their’ are justified by the common gender required. Still the discord of number is apparent to the point of harshness and may be avoided. Read ‘A person . . . is unclean until washed clean of the unclean work.’)
 Let me add a criticism of substance. On page 7 you answer a question under the heading “Seeking or Giving?”. The paragraph has gained brevity at the expense of clearness. The difference between giving co-operation and seeking it requires more elucidation. Likewise the analogy of love leading to feeding in one case and starving in another. But you are obscure and even baffling when you say that your policy of non-co-operation with Government
 
 allows of your seeking its co-operation when ever your purpose is, in your opinion, ‘very sacred and altogether good’. Most sensible people follow this rule in ordinary life, not seeking co-operation when they don’t care and seeking it when they care. They don’t proclaim it as a policy or give it a grand name.
 Ever yours affectionately,
 V. S. SRINIVASAN
 I wanted to share this letter with the public, because such a letter would help any publicist and his cause and that in an unexpected manner, more so when written without any thought of publication.
 I want also to use the publication of the letter for easing the tension between sanatanists and reformers. Let them learn that closest friendships can subsist between persons of contrary temperaments. As the public know, Sastri and I have opposite views on many important questions. our mutual regard and affection have never suffered on that account. There is no reason whatsoever why the same rule cannot be extended to parties and groups representing opposite schools of opinion. The sanatanists are out to defend religion as they believe it. I take their claim at its face value and deal with it as such. Why need they impute to me political motives when I solemnly assert that for me, too, the question of untouchability is a matter purely of religion? Would that the affection subsisting between Sastri and me prove so deep and extensive as to reach and affect the whole society !
 But enough of this. I almost hear Sastri’s spirit whispering to me: ‘You are misusing the medicine I prescribed to wean you from your disease of grimness and the like., Therefore, let me hasten to tell him and the public that I have in my little camp of privileged jester in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He succeeds in bending me almost double every day with laughter over his unexpected sallies. Gloom hides her fiendish face in his presence. No disappointment, however great, can make him gloomy for long. And he will not let me be serious for two consecutive minutes. He will not spare even my ‘saintliness’! It may deceive simple people but never the Sardar or the sanatanists. Both tear down the mask and compel me to see myself as they delight to see me. To be just to the sanatanists, let me admit that Vallabhbhai does not see me quite as sanatanists do. But that is beside the point. The thing that Sastri wants in our little family is there cent per cent. Next time he enters the Assembly or some such place, he must vote special thanks to the Government for putting Vallabhbhai with me or
 
 me with him.
 But this consoling information does not it any way release Sastri from his self-imposed obligation. For the Sardar will not do what Sastri can be trusted to do mostly. Unlike him, the Sardar has the wretched habit in the end of saying ‘ditto’ to all I say. And that is bad for anybody.
 Let the student note in passing Sastri’s love for the language he has mastered as few men have done. He is a purist in everything. We badly need purists in our counry. I want only purists as  fellow- workers in this glorious compaign of abolition of untouchability.
 As to the purity of the language of Harijan, whatever faults are found notwithstanding Sastri’s warning will be shared with me by Shastri, the Editor, and by Mahadev Desai, who shares with the schoolmaster the weakness for writing correctly in the language which for the moment he is using.
 I must leave the reader to find out for himself or herself the many other beauties of Sastri’s letter. If he will do so, he must read the letter three or four times and look up all the references in the first issue of Harijan.
 Harijan, 25-2-1933
 
   A CAMPAIGN OF ABUSE  
 Correspondents have been sending me cuttings from sanatanist newspapers containing distortions of conversations with me and attributing to me things I have never said.
 There is a sheet in Tamil that the Editor has been kindly translating to me. It contains nothing but libels against reformers. There is in it what purports to be a report of my conversation with a Madura   Panditlibtech_401_footnotelibtech_402_footnotewho   came   to   see   me   some    time    ago.    One correspondent wonders if, as the report has tried to make out, I could have said that there were no chaste women in India. The whole report is a caricature, the most material portions having been omitted. But I must not fill the columns of Harijan with a transcript of the caricature and the true version of the conversation of which Mahadev Desai took notes at the time. But I reproduce the portion relating to women. Here
 
 25-2-1933, and K. K. Venkataram Aiyar, 25-2-1933
 is first a free translation of the Tamil report:
 GANDHI: Should a pure woman consort with her husband when he is given up to sinful ways?
 THE PANDIT: Yes. The sinful husband will be metamorphosed into a virtuous man by the chastity of the wife.
 GANDHI: Are there chaste women in these days?
 PANDIT: How can we say there are none? There may be virtuous women for all we know. But why wander from our topic of conversation? Let us go on with our discussion.
Be it noted that the Madura Pandit or his friend took no notes.
Here is the relevant portion of Mahadev Desai’s notes:
 PANDIT: The temples are intended for women and Shudras. According to Shastras, Shudras only can enter the temples today, because they alone are observing their swadharmalibtech_403_footnote‘ viz., service, and chaste women have the same right. The others
 are burdened with karmas and duties, which now they have ceased to perform and, therefore, not entitled to enter a temple.
 GANDHI: So whilst a Brahmin may be a karma Chandalalibtech_404_footnote‘ his chaste wife may be entitled to enter a temple.
 PANDIT: The wife because of her chastity purifies her husband.
 GANDHI: Then, the moment a man has a wife who is pure, he becomes pure, no matter what sort of life he lives.
 PANDIT: Yes; his wife saves him.
 GANDHI: A man may go to the dogs, and yet if his wife is chaste, he becomes pure?
 PANDIT: Yes, his wife saves him; though what he does is wrong, his sins will be neutralized.
 GANDHI: So, if a man wants to remain immune from the consequences of his acts, all that he has to do is to be armed with a chaste wife.
 PANDIT: Quite so.
 GANDHI: Well, then, since we are not going to impute bad character to a single woman in India, for we must assume every one of them to be pure, unless, of course, she admits that she is impure or she has been found to be impure—every married man is pure and there should be no untouchability.
 PANDIT: She should be a true pativrata, a genuinely chaste woman, described
 
 in our religious books like Ramayana.
 GANDHI: How are you to determine that a particular woman satisfies that definition?
 PANDIT: Agni-pariksha. She must prove her chastity by undergoing the ordeal through fire, as Sita did.
GANDHI: And so, those who cannot come scatheless out of it must
 be declared to be impure?
 PANDIT: Indeed.
 GANDHI: I have done.
 Enough, however, about the Tamil sheet. A Gujarati sheet published by one claiming to be a sanatanist Shastri and now distributed broadcast in Hindi by sanatanist papers in North India professes to publish excerpts from my writings, sixty in all, which have the effect of proving me to be the very embodiment of everything anti-Hindu. Excerpts are torn from their context and made to bear a meaning the opposite of what they have when read in their context. Here is a sample of statements attributed to me:
 My parents and Sita were Bhangis.
 The Shastras are the productions of hypocrites, and the sages are so many Satans.
 I regard a Bhangi to be superior to a Brahmin.  I am an iconoclast.
Now my correspondents, some of them frankly puzzled, invite
 me to deal with these charges. I must respectfully but  resolutely decline the invitation. If there are people who will believe of me the things that are said in the writings sent to me, no refutation will save me. The public must take me as I am. What is more, the cause is everything, I am nothing.. If the campaign against untouchability is just and necessary for the very existence of Hinduism, it will survive the reputation of a thousand Gandhi.
 What is, however; sad, almost tragic, about these libellous statements is that they are made by responsible sanatanists reported to be learned men and presumed to be holy men fit to be religious teachers of unsophisticated simple folk. Their curious interpretations of the Shastras, their refusal to read the signs of the  times,  their defence of obviously superstitions and even inhuman beliefs and customs, one can understand as being honestly held. What may appear as superstitious and inhuman to the reformer may not appear so to
 them. But the resort by responsible pandits to untruths, distortions and suppression of truth is bound to do incalculable harm to Hindus and Hinduism. Let sanatanists put up as stubborn a fight as they like in defence of what they regard as a good cause. But I implore them to weed it of untruth.
 Harijan, 25-2-1933
 
   		‘WE DO NOT HATE’  
 One who is a Vedanta Shastri and Secretary of a  branch Brahmin Sabha writes:
 Sanatanists do not hate untouchables but hate their customs and daily actions. They are always ready to give all the Hindus, whether touchables or untouchables, every help they can. They give the untouchables priests, preceptors, Shastras with Ramnam, etc. But there are some so-called educated persons who always hate those untouchables. They are always keeping aloof from them and they want to pollute the sanatanists with the impurity brought by them from non-Hindus.
The foregoing I have taken from a fairly long letter and I have
 taken it as a sample from many such letters. ‘Hate, is perhaps the wrong word. I should use the word ‘despise’. And if to relegate a body of people to distant locations, to regard their touch, approach or sight as pollution, to throw at them the leavings of one’s food, to deny to them the use of public roads and institutions, even the use of public temples, is not to despise them, I do not know what the word ‘despise, means.
 The writer says that the untouchables have priests and preceptors. My own experience and the experience of numerous reformers is to the contrary. Despairing of real priests, they  have raised from among themselves what must be called ‘an apology for priests’. The writer betrays the secret when he says that untouchables have the “Shastras with Ramnam”, implying that they can have no access to any other Shastras. What are their daily customs and daily actions which evoke hatred? Their daily action was described in  graphic terms by the Poet in his messagelibtech_405_footnotefor our first issue. Save for carrion-eating, their customs are the same as those of innumerable caste Hindus. And carrion-eating is by no means common to all the
 
 untouchables so called. If a census were taken, we would be astonished to find that there are so few. I hope to present the readers of Harijan with reliable statistics in this matter. And I have not a shadow of a doubt that caste Hindus are responsible for this habit of carrion-eating and that, immediately they are welcomed as brothers and sisters and are offered the ordinary amenities of life on the same terms as caste Hindus, that habit will automatically drop out.
 Lastly, the common experience is that whatever has been done for the Harijans by caste Hindus has been done by those who have received education or who are otherwise ranked as reformers. It will give me pleasure to know that sanatanists as such have done much or anything for Harijans. I would gladly publish the list of their charities or other acts of service rendered to Harijans.
 Harijan, 25-2-1933
 
   		“HARIJAN” IN THE VERNACULARS  
 Some readers are anxious to know when, if at all, Harijan will be published in Hindi and other languages of the country.
 The idea was to publish the Hindi edition first and the English and the other editions after. But, as there was delay in publishing the Hindi edition, the Chairman of the Central Board of the Servants of Untouchables Society authorized the publication of the English edition without waiting for the former.
 I am happy to be able to inform the reader that  the  Hindi  edition will have been out before this is in his hands. Arrangements are proceeding as fast as possible for the publication of provincial editions in the provincial languages, e.g., in Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, etc. My prescription has been and is that they should all be self-supporting. Moneys that are being collected for and by  the  Central and the Provincial Boards must  be  predominantly  spent among the Harijans, i.e., for their educational and economic uplift. The weekly journals and leaflets are part of the necessary propaganda chiefly among caste Hindus. Therefore, they should pay for it. Except up to a point, I do not believe in presenting the public with free literature on any subject. It may be ever so cheap, but never free. I believe in the old Sanskrit proverb, ‘Knowledge is for those who would know’. But these are my personal views. I can only tender my advice to the organizations and organizers. There is no copyright in
 Harijan. Enterprising vernacular newspapers will publish their own editions of Harijan. Some have already written to me  of their  intention to do so. I can prevent no one, I can only plead with  everyone to follow the advice which I have tendered and which is based on considerable experience.

DEAR MAJOR BHANDARI’
 As you know I have been endeavouring during my present incarceration to study the heavens. You have kindly allowed astronomical literature to come in to me. I need a fair-sized astronomical telescope. Lady Vithaldas has one and has kindly  consented to give me a loan of it. Drs. Ramnathan and Desai of the Government observatory (Poona) who put the telescope right say that I won’t be able to use it unless they gave personal directions. They need to be with me for that purpose for about half an hour after the stars are observable. If there is any objection to this lesson being given to me in the yard in which I am kept during the night, it may be given in the yard reserved for untouchability interviews.
 I shall thank you if you will please ascertain the wishes of the Government in the matter.libtech_408_footnote

 If she continues to be as careless as she has been in her Urdu writing in her latest letter, please tell Begum Alam that I shall have to tone down my compliments. At one time I thought that she was
 
 competing with Zoralibtech_409_footnotein beautiful writing, but in her present letter I fancy that I can easily beat her after half a dozen letters from Zora. This won’t do. I do not want to break my idols. I had begun to think that Muslim women beat their Hindu sisters hollow in perfect writing, for every Muslim sister who has written to me has a beautiful hand.

 DEAR FRIEND’
 I have your letter of the 11th instant. There was a similar letter from another friend, whose name I forget at the moment, to whom I gave my views.
 I am quite convinced that sacrifice of dumb animals to appease a deity cannot have any religious or other merit about it. It is a sinful act. These sacrifices are a relic of barbarism and it would be a great sin if, in the face of the anti-untouchability movement with temple-entry as a part of it, animal sacrifices are not stopped altogether.
You can make whatever use you like of this letter.

   LETTER TO M. V. PARAMESWARAN CHETTIAR  
 February 25,1933
 
DEAR FRIEND’
 I have your letter. You are quite right in thinking that the object of the anti-untouchability movement is to level down the distinctions of high and low. There would be to the end of time different professions and occupations, different qualities also, but none of these differences necessitate the distinction of high and low.
 The motive behind the temple-entry is from this standpoint easily understood. It is to demonstrate to the Hindu mind and to the world that in the house of God there is no one high and no one low. This is a reform wanted by those caste Hindus who have got the conviction that hitherto the treatment meted out to the so-called untouchables has been sinful and contrary to the spirit of Hinduism.Those who think that temple-entry has anything to do with Congress politics are wholly mistaken.

He has certainly done  very  good  social work in Ratnagiri, 	and it must have been  a  very  serious disappointment to him, as 	also to Sjt.

          DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO H. KHADER KHAN    February 	25,1933 
 I 	thank you for your letter and copies of the Light.  	It is impossible for me to find the time for writing out a reply to 	all the things said in the paper, but there is no difficulty for a 	diligent        
 student to find an answer to every one of the things in my writings.
 I do not consider myself qualified for writing out a learned comparison between the Gita, the Bible and the Koran. I have studied these sufficiently for my own satisfaction. Beyond that I have considered it unnecessary for me to go.

  	I thank you for your two letters, one of which is unsigned, of the 	14th instant.  	I quite agree with you that so far as the civil rights are  	concerned, we can make no distinction between Christian untoucha- 	bles and Hindu untouchables, except that where  Christians  have 	special facilities for education you need not worry about them.  	About the other letter, I am unable to say anything definite in the 	absence  of  fuller  information,  but  this  I  can  say  that  if  	the rites are intended as a condition precedent to their admission 	to varnashramadharma, I am wholly opposed to the performance of the 	rites; if on the other hand, they are meant for their betterment and 	as part of a spiritual instruction, they might be quite harmless and 	even beneficial, if the selection is properly made and  the  rites  	are performed by men, qualified both by their character and 	learning.

   LETTER TO HARIBHAU PHATAK  
 February 25,1933
 
MY DEAR HARIBHAU’
 I had a very long conversation with Upasak. His wife is a very unsteady woman, she may even desert him any  day  and  she  is  wholly incapable of observing self-restraint. Such a couple cannot possibly go to the Ashram where brahmacharya is indispensable. I do not think also that Upasak will be able to conform to all the conditions of the Board, but he says that if the grant up to April is now paid, i.e., Rs. 22, he will try to do what he can to keep the school going and he will take his chance if he cannot. I think that this is a proposal worth considering. If, therefore, it is possible, I recommend Rs. 22 being paid to him with the absolute warning that nothing more will be paid to him thereafter.

 people. Unfortunately parents are not always in a position to take up this responsibility, and we have therefore to find suitable people from society, and although it is not easy to find such people, it is a search worth making.

 I have your letter. Many people dedicate books to  others  without waiting for their permission. You can also do likewise. I can do nothing to you. For me to give you the permission would mean that I have read your book and have generally approved of it. You will admit that this I cannot honestly do.

          CHI. 	RAMDAS’    LETTER TO RAMDAS GANDHI    February 	25,1933 
  	Khushaldas has passed away. I received both the accompanying letters 	yesterday evening. I have written to Shantilal and informed him. 	Khushaldas has indeed been released from the suffering of this life. 	The truth is that everybody who goes on a journey along that royal 	road is released from this life. For this life is given to us for 	repaying our debts, and nobody can leave before he has paid off his. 	If this idea is correct, death means that the person has paid off 	his debt 
 partially at least.
 He who knows with perfect conviction that this life is given to us for repaying our debts can repay his debts to all, and the ancients described that as attaining moksha. Moksha means complete freedom from debt and, consequently, end of the cycle of births for the person.
 I was pained to see your condition yesterday, your broken health and your mental suffering. I had no remedy for either, and was pained because you attributed to your father more power than he possessed. I felt as Harishchandra had done. He had become ready to sell his only son for the sake of dharma. I have been doing very much the same thing. Though I know the remedy for your poor health, I cannot adopt it because of my concern for dharma, nor can end your mental suffering for the same reason
 If you follow the rule that you cannot avail yourself of facilities which other prisoners who keep bad health would not get, you can do nothing to improve your health. I can understand that you would not like to ask for special facilities for yourself but it does not seem right to me that you should not avail yourself of facilities which may be offered to you when you explain to the authorities the condition of your health. When you are outside, you enjoy more facilities than the countless millions and never think about the matter. I ask for and enjoy, both in jail and outside, facilities which they can never hope to get, and am fully aware that I do so. But I do not feel that I violate dharma thereby. If an elephant tries to crawl like an ant, he will not succeed in becoming an ant thereby and will cease to be an elephant, which means that he will have lost his true nature. An elephant like me, however, would humbly accept his big size and consume food weighing more than thousands of ants and would also draw, without the least effort, loads which those ants could never draw. An elephant is entitled to consume food which the size of his body requires. Only, he must not waste that food by not giving proportionate service in return. That is, he should carry loads proportionate to his strength. If he does that, he will have consumed as much food and given as much service as an ant. This is communism. If, therefore, you can secure the food which your body requires by legitimate means and without humiliating yourself for the purpose, you should do so and improve your health, and then serve other people to the best of your ability.
 But even in trying to serve other people and securing facilities for yourself by legitimate means, you should know and understand
 your duty as a prisoner. A prisoner has no right except that of preserving his self-respect, for he ceases to be the master of his body as soon as he becomes a prisoner and the jail superintendent becomes its master. Even if the latter does not give the prisoner enough to eat or to drink or sufficient clothes to wear, the prisoner should remain contented and cheerful. Anybody who cannot do so is not a true prisoner. We must admit that in this age the British policy towards prisoners is comparatively more liberal than that of any other government. It is improving day by day. There is certainly room for much more improvement still, but that is another matter. A prisoner may fight to bring about such improvement. If, however,  he remembers the general principle stated above, he will not be disappointed if he fails in his attempt—for he has no absolute right to enjoy any facility. If you understand this reasoning fully, I shall be relieved and you will be able to overcome your mental unrest.
 I will certainly try to do what I can in regard to everything which you mentioned—but in my own way, and that is bound to take time. The delay will not make me impatient, and I wish that you also should not be. What can you or I do? Certainly we are not masters of the result.
 We can only try the best that we can. You have been doing what you can, and I also will do what I can. Even if we don’t succeed, you should dance with joy, and so will I.
 Be not moved by joy or sorrow; with the body were they created; None can escape them for by the Lord of Raghu were they decreed.
 Do you follow all this? Read the letter three or four times, and if
 you do not follow any point ask me to explain it again.
 Keep me informed about the condition of your health.
 Blessings from
 BAPU

      LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI    February 	26, 1933   CHI. 	NARANDAS,  	I got your letter. You will find with this a letter for Bhagwanji 	and one for Panditji. I believe that up to a  certain  quantity  (12 	ounces) milk is supplied to a prisoner at the cost of the jail.  	Personally I am glad that you have told Hariyomal that he could come 	back. Such persons learn only through  experience. Your suggestion 	regarding Parvati is excellent. If it is acted upon, both will be 	free.  	We must bear the expenses of Prabhudas’s journeys.  He  is rather 	timid. He will probably take time to find a partner, and it may even 	be a difficult task. He will not get over his restlessness till he 	marries. The forcible repression of his strong desire to marry was 	the cause of his restlessness.  	Your remaining firm about the problem of Lakshmi is very necessary. 	I cannot understand Dudabhai’s opposition. I have had no letter 	from Purushottam. I did ask him to write to me. I don’t think 	fasting will do him any harm. If he knows how to break the fast 	gradually, he is bound to benefit from it. If the bone-setter knows 	his job well, there will be no harm. It will probably be safer to 	get Kanu 
 examined by Haribhailibtech_428_footnote. If Mathuradas remains firm in his resolve, Motibehn will give up her opposition. It has been my unfailing experience that if one of the two parties is firm and the other party knows that he or she cannot be shaken from his or her resolve, the latter resigns herself or himself to the situation. As we forget in time our grief even over the death of one who was dearest to us, so also this folly leaves us by and by. The truth is there is some weakness in both parties and that is why they need each other’s support. Really speaking, such support is of no avail. If it helps any couple to keep their resolve, the fact must be counted as an accident. How can a blind person lead another blind person? How can one who  is  drowning save another in the same plight as himself? How can a person who is not free from passion help his or her partner to be so? The reasoning is quite simple.
 You need not take any trouble to enlist subscribers for Harijan. We will send five copies to the Ashram addressed to no particular subscribers. You may use them in any way that you can. See if you can maintain a file with four out of the five copies, or with the copies which remain unsold. Some day they will be useful.
 I got Satyarthaprakash, the slivers and the leather for the soles. Kellogg’s book must have been sent to Dhulia jail for Madhavji. Or it was with somebody in Vijapur. I am sure about this.

   RESIST UNTRUTH WITH TRUTH  
 February 26,1933
 It is unfortunate that untruth is being preached these days in the name of the sanatana dharma. I am receiving many new sanatanist newspapers which abound in untruth and indecency. I have been severely attacked in them. Many correspondents ask me to write something in reply to them. What can I write? Some say I do not believe in religion. In answer to that, except for me to say that religion is my life-breath what other reply can I give? A learned religious propagandist has written in the same vein. I can only give this reply to it that every word of it is almost entirely untrue. His words are not proved untrue because I say so, just as, his mere saying so does not establish what he says as truth.
 Still untruth can be resisted by truth alone. It is necessary to understand this great saying. The root of all actions is in thought. False thoughts result in false utterances; and after that, or along with it or without the utterances, action follows. In the same way right action has its roots in right thoughts. If the thought is not true then that action or utterance which seems true is only false, is erroneous. That is to say, if I am entirely truthful even in my thoughts falsehood will be warded off automatically. People will not believe these canards. This firm faith keeps me unperturbed, and my friends also should be unperturbed. This false propaganda cannot last long. It is that for a short while the atmosphere will be contaminated by it. In every agitation such things always happen.
 Let the reformer remember one thing. Let him never even contemplate untruth. We have a great religious mission before us. The abolition of untouchability is the great religious task before me, an onerous duty. To eradicate untouchability is the supreme duty of every Hindu. We can never accomplish this religious task with untruth. Ultimately anger or violence is also untruth. For this reason, it is necessary for those who serve Harijans never to be angry with their opponents; never to utter lies; but to overcome anger with affection, rudeness with courtesy, falsehood with truth, and violence with non-violence. And since we cannot control the outcome but can certainly practise truth and other virtues, God has said, “You have
 only the right to action; and not to the fruit thereof.”libtech_431_footnoteIf all those who serve Harijans will stick to truth, then the result will only be good. There is no doubt whatever in this.

    KEEPING THE WORD     A 	gentleman writes:    February 	26, 1933 
  You 	are very hasty. Although a non-co-operator, you even seek help from 	the Assembly. Why such weakness? Negotiate with the sanatanists and 	have the temples thrown open. I 	replied to this gentleman on these lines:  	I am not hasty. I am striving to fulfil my pledge. In Bombay, at the 	end of September, this large conference of Hindus leaders on behalf 	of the Hindus resolved to strive to get the temples thrown open to 	Harijans in as peaceful a manner as possible. Now this difficulty 	has cropped up in our way, namely, the British courts have decided 	that Harijans cannot enter many temples. Even a consensus among 	Hindus cannot abolish the law. Law can be abrogated by law alone. So 	legislation has become necessary and Shri Ranga Iyer has presented 	the Bill. It does not have even a hint of force or of interference 	with religion. According to the Bill, if the Hindu public wish so, 	temples can be thrown open to the Harijans. The temples will be 	thrown open when Hindu public decide to do so; never by the Bills. 	There is no question of co-operation or non-co-operation in this. 	But this matter is outside my province today. People should have 	this much faith that if I, the author of the principle of 	non-co-operation, am a partisan to the passing of these Bills, the 	possibility of the principle being violated  is very little. The 	important thing is that it is the duty of those who made the solemn 	declaration in Bombay to do their utmost to remove the legal 	obstruction. Only then can they say:  Rather 	die than go back upon one’s word.libtech_432_footnote   From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 1070; also Harijan 	Sevak,10-3-1933

    LETTER TO VIYOGI HARI        February 	27,1933 
    BHAI 	VIYOGI HARI,  	I have gone through Harijan Sevak; I did not like it. It 	requires more labour and more study. It contains the news of the 	opening of the Santram temple at Nadiad. The news is published 	despite the fact that the Santram temple has not been thrown open. 	No news item should be quoted from the papers without verifying it. 	Publication of such news always undermines one’s prestige and 	harms the cause of dharma. The prefix ‘it is reported’ is 	certainly there but who can thank you for it? Very many things are 	reported but few turn out to be true on verification. This must now 	be corrected. Enquire from the head of the Santram temple. The 	account of activities has taken up too much space. It indicates that 	you had nothing left to print and that is why even after so much 	space being used up the lower portion remained blank. And that is an 	eyesore. You could have found sufficient material from the two 	issues of Harijan lying with you. Certainly there was no lack 	of time. The translation of my article should have borne at the end 	the appellation ‘translation’. Even the translation is not 	satisfactory. Harijan Sevak should not be stuffed with 	articles but it should be a guide to the workers  and  should abound 	with news. The problems facing the sanatanists should be indicated 	and solutions suggested. The falsehoods of the sanatanists should be 	exposed at the appropriate time. Hence we must receive exhaustive 	reports from all provinces. The letters published already in Aaj 	need not be reproduced. 
 I am sending today a wirelibtech_435_footnotein this connection. I trust you will not mind my plain speaking. All this is meant not to discourage but to encourage you.
The two articles I sent yesterday must have reached you.

   LETTER TO AMRITLAL V. THAKKAR  
 February 28,1933
 DEAR THAKKAR BAPA,
 I know you don’t believe in giving yourself rest. I propose to join you in not giving you rest. Mahadev wrote to you at my instance yesterday about the wretched get-up of the Harijan Sevak, both as to the matter and the manner. I sent even a telegram to Viyogi Hari. Today I send you what has appealed to me as an extraordinarily clever report on the Harijan organizations of the Punjab. I am dealing with it in the ensuing Harijan, but you should circulate the copies of the enclosed report among the Punjab organizations and get their replies. If you think that there is absolutely nothing to be said for the report and that it simply contains a series of exaggerations and unsupported statements, naturally you will not go to the expense of copying the report and multiply your and your staff’s work. You will then return me the report with a brief note that it is not worthy of consideration. Perhaps you know the writer; if you do, you will let me know all about him. I am still in correspondence with him. I wonder if you read the English Harijan. It is addressed to you personally as it is to every Harijan servant, because it contains suggestions for workers, appeals to them, as also arguments to arm them for their battle. Arguments and appeals you may not need at all, but suggestions you must welcome, no matter from what quarter they come. There is one suggestion of my making in my article on the Punjab report which I do not want to duplicate, because I expect you to see it in the Harijan. If you see a flaw in the reasoning, or if you find it to be impossible to carry out, you will tell me and if your counter-argument appeals to
 
 me I shall correct it. But it is better that instead of making big suggestions privately I make them publicly.
 Yours sincerely,

 DEAR FRIEND,
 
 I have your letter. I believe I have a previous letter of yours unanswered. I must however deal with it when I come to it in the regular course.
 With reference to your question in your letter of 23rd instant, my emphatic answer is, like the rest, the present priesthood  is decadent. If it was not, we should find Hinduism in a different state altogether.

  	I thank you for your  valuable letter.libtech_436_footnoteI am glad  that yourdaughter is happy with her husband. 	I know you will do all you can for the Harijan.  	I appreciate your argument about temple-entry. In my opinion, based 	even upon the present experience of new temples which are being 	opened, the donors have no fixed ideas. They simply build temples 	for Hindus without a rigid definition for the class of Hindus to be 	admitted to the temples. Hinduism has never been a rigid faith. It 	has kept abreast of the times. Untouchables of today were not the 	untouchables, say, a hundred  years ago, and those who were 	untouchables a thousand years ago are undoubtedly not untouchables 	today.  	Would you say that the English law of Trusts is applicable to Hindu 	usage? Some of the most learned Shastris who are no reformers 	of the Western style do not hesitate to give the opinion that Hindu 	public temples should never have been closed to untouchables. 	According to your argument, our ancestors could stop the march of 	Hinduism by opening temples in accordance with the usage then in 	existence. I would like you therefore to re-consider your position, 	and if there is a flaw in my deductions from your argument, I would 	like you to strive with me. For I have no desire to see any 	injustice done to any party or person.  Yours 	sincerely,  SJT. 	K. N.

   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI  
 March 1,1933
 
CHI. NARANDAS,
 I got your mail (a big packet). I think it would be best to serve rice to Maitri and others who insist on it. We may only explain the properties of the different classes of grain and not press anybody to follow our advice. These properties are a matter of direct experience. I see from experience every day that we should consume a minimum of starches. Rice is pure starch, and so it is served to people who cannot digest any other grains. The derogatory use of the term “rice-eater’, is perfectly justified. But this argument will convince only those who use their reason. It is not at all likely to appeal to a person whose stomach will not tolerate anything but rice. I could write a great deal more on this subject, but I have no time for that.
 Ramabehn saw me yesterday. You have not won her trust. Try harder. She wishes to learn English. She wishes to do so in spare time after doing her work for the Ashram. Go and meet her. Listen to what she has to say and request Mathew or Mary or Duncan to give her one hour daily. Do all you can to satisfy her desire to learn English. If any of the women who are old inmates of the Ashram wish to learn  English, their desire is natural. We feel the necessity of its knowledge every hour, and also observe that as soon as a person learns English he or she goes up in the esteem of others. We cannot check this tide. There is no harm in knowing the language itself. The harm comes from the misuse of the language, from its blind worship. Women are not likely to cultivate such an attitude soon. If you see any flaw in this reasoning, point it out to me.

   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI  
 Morning, March 2, 1933
 
CHI. NARANDAS,
 You must have received the letter which I wrote to  you  yesterday. Make careful preparations for Lakshmi’s marriage and see that everything goes well. Jamna and you should give away the bride, and Velanbehn should offer the bridegroom. If possible, I will send Lakshmidas there. As usual, keep a dhoti, shirt, cap, takli and a copy each of the Gita and the Bhajanavali ready for the bridegroom. Tie the marriage knot with the ends. Give a translation of the vowslibtech_444_footnoteto both the bride and the bridegroom. And they should fast on that day and eat nothing till after the ceremony is over. You, Jamna and Velanbehn also should fast. Both the bride and  the  bridegroom should perform the ceremonial worship of the cow and the tree and recite Chapter XII of the Gita. It is not necessary to invite any friends except Anasuyabehn. We don’t want the marriage to be published in newspapers, though we do not wish to keep it a secret either. The bride and the bridegroom may leave for home by the night train and start working immediately. Velanbehn will arrange for the sari on behalf of Maruti. If you wish to ask any other question, you may do so. Invite all Harijan friends to attend the wedding. If you wish, you may serve them refreshments. In that case, I believe fruit will be the best. But consult your own convenience in all this, and make any changes  which you feel necessary. Let the members of the Committee come together and plan the arrangements. Invite the senior women inmates also to the meeting of the Committee. Let the day of marriage be for us a sacred day of tapascharya and self-purification and one to be celebrated in keeping with our ideal of simplicity and self-control. Let all present shower their blessings on the bride and the bridegroom. Maruti’s letters simply fill me with admiration for him. If he remains true to the aspirations which he expresses in them, we shall believe that he  must  have  become  a   member   of   Lakshmidas’s   family blessed with the holy merit of his good deeds in previous lives. Lakshmidas’s love for him, too, must be wonderful beyond words.
 
 And what excellent training he must have given!
 Explain to everybody in the Ashram that it is the universal experience that anybody who does not give his best, physically and mentally in serving the sick, can do no other useful work, and that the Ashram exists to enable its inmates to serve others. Nobody in the Ashram, therefore, should be half-hearted in doing service.

  	Next time when you feel like writing you should trace the spelling 	of your name. As I read your signature I can only make out ‘Mell 	Bull’. I can easily read ‘Bull’ as ‘Ball’, but Esther 	confounds me. She has clearly spelt your name as ‘Nellie Ball’. 	I have therefore adopted her clear spelling in preference to your 	doubtful ‘Mell’. If therefore I have made any mistake you must 	go for Esther. But I see that you are a little philosopher with a 	big heart. Therefore you will exclaim, ‘What is in a name? It is 	the spirit that matters’. And whether I trace Mell or Nellie my 	spirit goes out to you, the little invalid daughter. But I propose a 	peremptory change in the way you describe yourself. Your body is no 	doubt shattered, but your spirit seems to have risen triumphant over 	the body. I do not want to think of you therefore as my ‘little 	invalid daughter’, but my ‘little daughter strong with the faith 	in God’. Now that C. F. Andrews is there you will certainly have 	the joy of receiving visits from him frequently and not only rarely. 	He is a genius for seeking out persons like you and going to them as 	often as he can. To visit people in power is a tax upon his mind. To 	visit people like you and me is a matter of perennial joy to him. He 	derives his strength from his association with those whom the world 	calls weak and helpless and who often but wrongly feel so 	themselves. But I must now stop.  	You should give my love to your doctor and ask him to write to me 	about you.

I am glad you possess all the volumes of the Upanishads. Some
 of them will no doubt appear dry to you, but I am quite sure that you will not miss the central teaching which permeates all the principal Upanishads.

  	I have received from Mr. M. I. David Rs. 2,500. So far as I know, it 	is the first answer to the appeal on behalf of his scheme. Mr. David 	wants to remain anonymous. I am sending the money to you by 	registered and insured packet. For the present you will  please 	retain the money on account of the David Scheme. It would be better 	to put it so as to bear interest at once. We won’t need to use it 	all at once and I expect to get his own letter which he has 	promised.  	I think that we ought to be able to announce a few scholarships. You 	blessed the scheme, the Bombay board blessed the scheme and if it 	ends with a solitary subscriber, and that also the creator himself, 	it would be a miniature disaster. Do, therefore, induce Lala 	Shreeram and others at least to give these paltry sums and let me 	announce some     
 names.
 I hope Viyogi Hari and Amritlal Thakkar have shown you what  I had to say about the Hindi Harijan. It needs very considerable improvement. You were to have given some personal attention to it. Do please give it.
 I hope you are keeping good health. Is the nose causing trouble? Whether it is or not, it should receive early attention.

   INTERVIEW TO ASSOCIATED PRESS  
 March 2,1933
 Gandhiji stated in reply to a question that, if the necessary permission was given, he would, after duly examining the terms of the permission, quite willingly make a declaration of his policy on political questions. But just now he was not thinking about it at all. Politics was excluded from his thoughts. He was deliberately practising and doing this for two reasons, firstly, that he might not be burdened with its weight when he had another subject in hand to which he had been permitted to devote attention, and secondly nothing might escape his lips, even inadvertently, which would be tantamount to a breach of faith with the Government. He was now so constituted that he could not discuss politics. He added:
It is a wonderful gift God has given me.
 Did it mean he was not interesting himself in contemporary political events?
 Gandhiji replied:
 Oh yes, but only as a foreigner would. I note them in passing, but I bestow little thought on them. Of course, if the ban is lifted, and I am permitted to speak, I can, without any difficulty, speak on questions of policy and fundamental principles.
 He added that those agents in his brain who were now on leave would then begin to work.
 Asked if in his own opinion, the Harijan movement had not diverted attention from civil disobedience, Gandhiji replied:
Surely, it is a matter which everyone can decide for himself,
 because, all the materials are before him. One might as well ask me what is the height of the Himalayas when both he and I are seeing it. one will say it is 23,000 feet, another 25,000.
 Asked as to what was his estimate of the height, Gandhiji replied at once.

Venkatarama Sastri, 	ex-Law Member of the Madras Government, is taken from the daily 	Press.  SJT. 	KELKAR’S 	COMPROMISE  	Sjt. N. C. Kelkar  was  good  enough  to  pay  me  a  visit  at  my 	request to discuss the question of temple-entry.  I  was  anxious to 	know what he thought of the proposed legislation. He said that    
 
 he  had  for  years  held  that  there  was  no  way  out  of  legislation   in matters, even affecting religion,  where  a  law  alone  could  set  them right, as in the case of temple-entry. Judge-made law had ordained that trustees of public Hindu temples were bound to pre vent Harijans from entering them. No amount of public opinion could undo that law. It could demand the passage of a law but could not make the law permitting temple-entry.
 Whilst,   therefore,	Sjt.	Kelkar	agreed	that	measures	like Sjt. Ranga Iyer’s were necessary, he said that actual temple-entry would only be effected by amicable settlement. He had no doubt that Harijans should enter temples on precisely the same terms as caste Hindus. But public opinion might not be ripe for the former’s admission to the sanctuaries. If so, the caste Hindus should
 forgo the rights which Harijans could not have. He, therefore, suggested that in all the public temples there should be a common barrier set up, beyond which nobody but the priest actually in charge of the ceremonial could go. This would mean that, in some temples where now caste Hindus are able to enter the sanctuary and touch the idol, they would have to deny themselves that right, if they were not prepared to let Harijans enjoy it equally with them. I said I should have no objection whatsoever to such a compromise, provided, of course, that it was honestly carried out in practice. Nothing would please me better than to see this unseemly domestic wrangle close at the earliest moment.
 HARIJAN, 4-3-1933
 
   A WAIL FROM KUMAON  
 A Harijan correspondent from Haldvani writes complaining that nothing is being done by caste Hindus on their behalf in his district. This complaint is a sign that the message of the September resolutions has reached the Harijan masses and that, therefore, they are expecting great things. Provincial Boards of the Servants of Untouchables Society will have to organize their work so as to penetrate the remotest village and let the Harijans know that every attempt is being made to fight the monster of untouchability.
 Harijan, 4-3-1933
 
  
   JOINT OR SEPARATE?  
 Correspondents suggest that there should be separate temples, schools, wells, etc., for Harijans for the time being. A general adoption of the suggestion may easily be the way to perpetuate untouchability, and we might as well have had separate electorates
 and elections for them, if we are to have everything  else separate for them. I would certainly not have staked my life just to avoid separate electorates. I staked it, and it is still at stake, for the purpose of eradicating the present unnatural untouchability from the religion itself. I rose against separate electorates, because it would have spelt an end to the effort for the destruction of the canker. They would have meant an end to effective penance by the penitent caste Hindu. With the Yeravda Pact, such penance is a possibility, whether the penitents are in the majority or the minority. That there is  a mighty upheaval in Hinduism and that we have two well-defined divisions working actively for their respective objectives is the surest justification for the Yeravda Pact. As a result of it, the religious untouchability goes or the reformer. If he is to be true to his pledge, the reformer has no other choice.
 Therefore, separate temples and separate other services must be regarded with suspicion. Let us consider the limitations of the suggestion.
 Till the legal obstacle in the way of opening public temples to untouchables is removed, the opening of existing temples on a large scale comes to a standstill. But the march of reform cannot be stayed. There are three ways of doing the thing.
  Where 	public opinion and 	trustees are 	quite demonstrably in 	favour of 	opening temples, 	trustees may open the 	temples under their 	charge and 	may take the 	risk of 	an injunction being 	issued against them.  Private 	temples should be 	opened where 	the owners are willing 	to open them.  Wealthy 	and spiritually 	minded people 	may open new 	temples under pure 	methods of consecration. 	(I add 	the adjective advisedly 	because I 	believe that all is not 	well with the existing temples.) 	These temples will be 	purposely designed for 	the Harijans as 	well-as for the other Hindus. These must, therefore, be situated in such 
 localities as are easily accessible to Harijans.
 Common schools and wells should be opened where the existing ones are not available for Harijans either owing to the violent and successful opposition of the neighbours or some other unavoidable cause. Harijans cannot be left uncared for in matters of necessary services till public opinion has ripened. If there is a clearly awakened body of Hindus who have the same feeling towards Harijans as if they were their own kith and kin, they will not wait for public opinion to consolidate itself before taking action. They will do their best to supply pure water and good education to their own newly found kith and kin.
 There is one special consideration in favour of opening what may be called preparatory schools for Harijan children. I cannot do better than quote the reason in the words of a co-worker who has gone to live in their midst and who writes:libtech_461_footnote
 My school is conducted in a Harijan verandah. Some of my scholars are
 . . . full  of dirt.	My  lesson, therefore, begins with telling them how  to
 keep clean, and behave.	They are bad liars. Some of them are industrious
 and wise. I play with them and perhaps learn more than I teach.	I begin my
 class in the early morning. I sleep in a Harijan dharmasala about a furlong from the school.	I naturally sometimes enter their homes when they do not
 mind. Many of them are dark holes with inmates packed like matches.	But
 I am a novice. I know  my limitations.	I long to fulfil God’s conditions  for
 becoming a true Vaishnav.
 This is but a sample of the condition of raw Harijan children. We want every one of these children to learn to live in a clean and decent manner. We want them all to attend the common public  schools. Therefore, preparatory schools for them are an absolute essential if we mean honest business.

   CONFUSING THE ISSUE  
 The Secretary of the Jat-Pat Torak Mandal, i. e., Society for the Abolition of Caste, has published in the daily Press his letter to me of the 18th ultimo.
 He does me the honour of calling me a ‘deep thinker’ and in the same breath withdraws it by saying:
 You have failed to see that the caste system is the origin of
 
 untouchability and that one cannot do without the other.
 I venture to suggest to the Secretary that, if he is really honest in his paying me the compliment, he must suspend his judgement about the caste system and follow out the reasoning of the ‘deep thinker’ of his imagination; whereas if he has called me a ‘deep thinker’ in order to increase the height from which I have fallen, I  fear  that  no reasoning of mine will affect him.
 However, according to my wont, I propose to give the Secretary credit for honesty and shall, therefore, strive with him. I am one of those who think that the caste system, in so far as it is the English equivalent for varnashrama, is nothing but a division of labour or duty. Anyone who will take the trouble of looking at any religious book must find this out for himself. In that sense the divisions or classes are four and no more, and these classes are known all the world over. One is the repository of knowledge, the other is that of power, the third is that of wealth and the fourth is that of service. All these four labours are regarded as duties to be discharged by every one of them for the protection and advancement of dharma, and everyone who performs his duty to the best of his knowledge and ability gains equal merit with the rest, if the latter, too, do likewise. The merit, therefore, consists not in being one or the other, but  in  the performance of the duty assigned to it. Here, there is no untouchability. There is no superiority. And this is the essence of varnadharma. It may be non-existent today and it is so. That, however, in no way diminishes the force of my argument that there is no superiority and inferiority in the original conception of varnadharma and that untouchability can never be a necessary outcome of this pure division of duties. If this varnashrama cannot be revived in its original simplicity and purity, persons like me would consider it to be a calamity. Others may welcome it, but let varnadharma and untouchability stand or fall on their own merits  or  demerits. Confusing the two can only add to the difficulty of removal of untouchability, which all reformers and even many sanatanists desire. The caste-abolitionists must, therefore, hold their souls in patience and join the battle against the common and admitted  evil  of untouchability.
 Varnashrama, as I interpret it, satisfies the religious, social and economic needs of a community. It satisfies the religious needs, because a whole community, accepting the law, is free to devote ample
 time to spiritual perfection. Observance of the law obviates social evils and entirely prevents the killing economic competition. And if it is regarded as a law laying down, not the rights or the privileges of the community governed by it, but their duties, it ensures the fairest possible distribution of wealth though it may not be an ideal, i.e., strictly equal, distribution. Therefore, when people in disregard of the law mistake duties for privileges and try to pick and choose occupations for self-advancement, it leads to confusion of varna and ultimate disruption of society. In this law, there is no question of compelling any person to follow the parental occupation against his or her aptitude; that is to say, there can be no compulsion from without as there was none for, perhaps, several thousand years, during which the law of varnashrama worked without interruption.  By training, the people had recognized the duty and the justice of the law, and they voluntarily lived under it. Today, nations are living in ignorance and breach of that law and they are suffering for it. The so-called civilized nations have by no means reached a state which they can at all regard with equanimity and satisfaction.
 It is easy enough to see that this conception of varnashrama has nothing to do with restrictions as to inter-dining and intermarriage. The Vedas and the Mahabharata are filled with illustrations both of inter-dining and intermarriage. But these are matters of choice, not a matter of religious regulation. No one can be compelled or required to dine with any other or contract marital relations. No doubt social habits will grow up and regulate these things more or less rigidly. But it would be wrong to dignify them by the name of religious observances. Therefore, inter-dining and intermarriage can form no part of the campaign against untouchability. In so far as they are a matter for reform, they must be treated, in my opinion, as an absolutely separate subject, unconnected either with untouchability or even with varnashrama reform. So far as the multiplicity of castes apart from varnadharma are concerned, they are essentially  trade guilds or societies, with intermarriage and inter-dining restrictions of a more or less rigid character superimposed upon them. Castes are as numerous as the leaves of the famous banana tree whose every branch becomes a trunk for shooting out more branches. They are  undergoing a perpetual transformation. Many have disappeared and new ones are appearing. Surely they have nothing to do with varnashrama; nor have they anything to do with religion. That today they are regarded by sanatanists as an integral part of Hinduism arises,
 in my opinion, from an utter ignorance of the working of these trade guilds. There are undoubtedly many undesirable practices that have crept into these corporations, but that is only because Hinduism as a religion has ceased to be a living, vitalizing force. We are today living upon capital which is itself being fast exhausted.

   HINDI “HARIJAN”  
 The Hindi edition of  Harijan  is  at  last  out. The first  issue was published on the 23rd ultimo.libtech_464_footnoteIt is the same size as the English edition and has no paid advertisements. The annual subscription is Rs. 3-8-0, a single copy is one anna. It contains among other things articles by Swami Satyadeva and Sheth Ghanshyamdas Birla and me, a brief poem by the well-known Hindi poet and author, Shri Maithilisharam Gupta. There is naturally something from the pen of the Editor, who is Sjt. Viyogi Hari, well known to the Hindi literary world. For years, service of the Harijans has been a passion with Sjt. Viyogi Hari. He was for some time himself editing and publishing a journal specially devoted to the removal of untouchability. There are, too, the usual news columns. The news service leaves much to be desired. But no doubt, in this and every other  respect,  every succeeding number will be better than its predecessor till the desired standard is reached. The habitation of the paper is Birla Mills, Delhi, the address of the Servants of Untouchables Society, under whose auspices the paper is being published. I may inform the reader that the Bengali edition was expected to make its appearance on the 28th ultimo with Sjt. Satis Das Gupta of the Khadi Pratishthan as Editor. Satisbabu says in his letter to me that, in order to overtake the last issues of the English edition of the Harijan, his first two numbers would be double numbers. Arrangements are in progress for bringing out the Gujarati Harijan.

writes:libtech_465_footnote
 You have pointed outlibtech_466_footnotethat the use of the word ‘Harijan’ to denote the untouchable class in the present movement inaugurated in their behalf has by no means been novel and that the word had thus been used previously by a Gujarati poet. I have taken up the pen just to let you know, as the news is
 
 likely to give you particular pleasure, that the very word has been used in the same sense by Moropant, the celebrated Maharashtrian poet. The stanzalibtech_467_footnotein question is as follows. ...
 Similar testimony is to be found in the writings not only of the other saints of Maharashtra but also the saints of the whole of India. If industrious scholars will collect such sayings of the saints from different parts of the country, I shall gladly hand them to the Editor for publication in the Harijan, and they will be a help and an inspiration to the workers in the cause of the abolition of untouchability.

   AS THEY SEE US  
 Hardly has the great central organization of the Servants of Untouchables Society made the commencement, when complaints against it and the provincial organizations have cropped up. They come chiefly and naturally from Harijans. One of these correspon- dents sent to me some time ago an able letter, undertaking to give details if I desired. I took him at his word and asked him to give me details; and the letter he has sent me in reply is abler than the first. It will compete with any well-written report of an inspector. It contains a summary of reports of every organization claiming to work in the writer’s Province for the uplift of Harijans, and after giving me suffi- cient details, his one conclusion about all the organizations practically without exception is:
 They are run principally by caste men who have their own axes to grind  or who are in need of some occupation that would maintain them decently. The utmost that some of these have done is to fling a few scholarships at Harijan boys. Some others have been great at delivering lectures. All have come to us as patrons. Hardly has anyone come as a friend and equal, let alone as a servant. Your provincial organization is no exception. It is difficult for a Harijan to approach its chief man without fear and trembling. He is always in danger of being met with a frown.
My correspondent is also not without suggestions, which may be
 
 summarized thus:
 If you are to take advantage of the great awakening that has taken place, you must concentrate upon primary education on a mass scale. You will not drive out the ignorance of ages without spreading that education. We shall certainly help, but seeing that caste Hindus want to remove untouchability  and make us one with them, there is no better way of employing their money and their labour than in imparting this education.
 It is necessary to know the Harijan mind in any programme of work that may be taken up. Caste Hindus, for whom removal of untouchability is a matter of penance and purification, have undoubtedly to do much more than open schools everywhere. I have discussed elsewherelibtech_468_footnotewhere such schools may be opened. The conduct of caste Hindus would be generally tested by its reaction upon the mass mind of the Harijans. If we have really changed towards them, they will feel the change in a thousand ways. Our activity, I mean that of caste Hindus, will affect every department of their lives. Even in the remotest village we are interdependent, so much so that this interdependence cannot be dissolved all at once, even if we desired it, without resulting in the greatest harm to the nation in general; and this interdependence, which is today that of slave and master, will never be corrected unless there is absolute religious equality. It is a tremendous task, but as we progress towards the goal, the truth must dawn upon every caste Hindu that there is no half-way house between abject slavery and perfect religious equality. Hence my humble insistence upon temple-entry without losing sight of the other things we must do.
 My correspondent is bitter in discussing what he considers to be the extravagant management of the different organizations that have come under his lash. As an expert organizer that I may claim to be, I have been generally guided by the rule that the cost of administration, that is, overhead charges, should never exceed 10% of the receipts— 5% being the ideal—the balance going to the cause which brought the organization into being. I suggest this test to the Central Board and the Provincial Boards and all other independent Harijan organizations run by caste Hindus. Let it not be said of us that we spend more on running the organizations than upon Harijans themselves. Let us see
 
 
 to it that, out of every Rs. 100 received as donation for the Harijan cause Rs. 90 go straight into the pockets of Harijans. Therefore, our officials should be largely volunteers, never highly paid wherever paid service is required. Wherever it is possible, we should get Harijans. We should select candidates and train them. The correspondent says that peons in the organizations inspected by him are not drawn from the Harijan ranks.
 Let every organization for the service of Harijans  introspect itself in the light of the criticism I have condensed and the suggestions I have made. I know that the correspondent has painted the picture as black as he could. He has refused to see the bright side. I know something of Harijan service done by caste men in the different Provinces. I know that there is a bright side to the work of the organizations referred to by my correspondent, but it was unnecessary for me to give the bright side. It will take care of itself, if the organizations will take care of the dark side of the picture. Most organizations have a capacity for self-deception. There is a tendency towards self-glorification. The Harijan exists for the sake of giving due prominence, therefore, to every bit of criticism  that  can  be levelled against us by Harijan critics.

   IS IT LOSS OF FAITH?  
A co-worker writes:
 Some of us feel that your ‘fasting unto death’ may mean a conscious or unconscious loss of faith in the efficacy of non-violence. Can you enlighten us, who have derived our faith in non-violence from you?
 It is a flattering thought that some people have derived their faith in non-violence from me. But I would warn them that I may prove a broken reed at a critical juncture, if they have not assimilated the spirit of non-violence and if it has not become an integral part of their life. Faith in a man is a perishable quantity, for it vanishes like smoke when their idol does not come up to their expectations; but what gives us hope and courage in the nick of time is an undying faith in a cause or a principle, irrespective of persons from whom it is derived.
 Having uttered this warning, let me say that my ‘fast unto death, was not due to loss of faith in non-violence, but it was, as I have
 already said on more than one occasion, the last seal upon that faith. Sacrifice of self even unto death is the final weapon in the hands of a non-violent person. It is not given to man to do more. I, therefore, suggest to this co-worker and all the others that in this religious battle against untouchability they must be prepared joyously even to ‘fast unto death, if such an urgent call comes to them. If they feel that they are party to the September pledgelibtech_469_footnotegiven unsolicited to the Harijans and if they cannot make good the pledge in spite of ordinary effort, how else, being non-violent, will they propose to deliver the goods except by laying down their lives?
 The Shastras tell us that, when  people  in  distress  prayed  to God for relief and He seemed to have hardened His heart, they declared a ‘fast unto death’ till God had listened to their prayer. Religious history tells us of those who survived their fast, because God listened to them but it tells us nothing of those who silently and heroically perished in the attempt to win the answer from a deaf God. I am certain that many have died in that heroic manner, but without their faith in God and non-violence being in the slightest degree diminished. God does not always answer prayers in the manner we want Him to. For Him life and death are one, and who is able to deny that all that is pure and good in the world persists because of the silent death of thousands of unknown heroes and heroines!

   THE BOGEY OF BOYCOTT  
 This is the substance of what a correspondentlibtech_470_footnotewrites in the course of a long letter:
 Some of us caste men tried and succeeded in having certain wells in some of the Bihar villages opened to the use of Harijans. But the Brahmin pujaris nearby retorted by stopping the service in the village temple, and the local Brahmins threa- tened to stop all religious services at shraddhalibtech_471_footnote, marriage and the like. This frightened the simple villagers. I feel tempted to offer satyagraha, but I desist lest I might do so in anger. What would you advise in such cases?
 
 
 Not long ago there was a similar case near Trichinopoly. Dr. Rajan acted with decision. Himself a Brahmin by caste and Shudra by right of service, he defied the orthodox Brahmins who had refused even to perform the funeral rights in the case of death in a reformer’s family.
 My advice, therefore, is that there is no occasion in such cases for satyagraha. Those who regard untouchability as a sin must be prepared to suffer all the hardships of boycott and the like as a part of the process of purification and penance. In all humility they must learn to dispense with the outward form. Anything done in the name of God and for His sake needs no support from an officiating priest, whether it is a death or a marriage or a shraddha. Anybody can unite  a couple in marriage by reciting the sacred mantras, whether it is Ramanama of any of the known formulae according to the tradition in which one has been brought up. God is known not by His thousand names only but by millions of names. Any name which comes from the heart and by which we can recognize Him is as good as any other or, rather, the best of all for us. But these things can only be done by those who have the courage of their conviction, faith in themselves, faith in their cause and faith in a living God. This is not a movement in which faint-heartedness can be of any use. Only workers with stout hearts and irreproachable character will be able to infect the villagers with their own strong convictions and enable them to do the right thing in the face of boycott or worse persecution.

         CHI. 	MIRA,    LETTER TO MIRABEN      March 	4, 1933 
  	This is Saturday before prayer time 3.30 a.m. No letter from you 	till Friday evening. I put off even yesterday in the hope of getting 	your letter in the afternoon and still posting you something 	yesterday but that was not to be. So each week your letter is 	getting later in coming. But though I look forward to it I do not 	worry.  	The letter-writing is not a right of prisoners. Therefore there is 	no deprivation. What in ordinary life religion calls duty becomes or 	seems to be compulsion in the prison life. But that is not the case 	with us. We are in a way voluntary prisoners. Therefore we may not 	feel 
 the compulsion as such when a certain permission is withdrawn or is regulated in the manner suited to the authorities. I can do without your letters if need be and you must train yourself to do likewise and feel happylibtech_472_footnote. In a manner everybody trains himself to  do  without things when he cannot get them. A follower of  the  Gita  dharma  trains himself to do without things with happinesslibtech_473_footnotelibtech_474_footnotecalled equanimity in  Gita  language,  for  happiness  of the  Gita  is  not  the   opposite  of unhappiness. It is superior to that state. The devotee of the Gita  is neither happy nor unhappy. And when that state is reached, there is no pain, no pleasure, no victory, no defeat, no deprivation, no possession. Prison life is a life of privilege if we learn to practise the Gita teaching. It is easier in the prison than outside. For outside we have the opportunity of picking and choosing. Hence we are not always able to test ourselves. In the prison, there are various jarring occasions. Are we able to bear them with equanimity? If we are, it is well with us.
 I have kept your letter of 19th February which I got after I had written my weekly letter. You had Mridula in your party. I hope she is quite well. She was not quite strong and healthy. Ba should look after her jaws. Does she wear her teeth? Does she take enough exercise? Does she do any reading herself? Does she get weekly letters or fortnightly? I know last time she did not get several of my letters. I do not know what happened to them. This time I am anxious that she should get my letters. So far as I am aware prison authorities had not withheld her letters.
 I do propose to write to Dr. Saunderslibtech_475_footnoteabout your history. But whatever the history, there is only one treatment which I have mentioned to you. There need be therefore no waiting for his report. It would be interesting to know what he has to say. Sunlight, simple food in which vitamins have not been destroyed and exercise in the open air will dissolve all glands and other affections.
 Verrier has cried off the proposed marriage with Mary Gillett. But his communications are not happy. He is showing a  very vulnerable spot in his character. But it is well to know our friends as
 
 they are and still to love them.
 Here they come for the prayer. 4.10 a.m. I stop. Love from us all.

      LETTER TO JANAKDHARI PRASAD    March 	4, 1933   DEAR 	JANAKDHARI BABOO,    	You were quite right in sending me your long letter. You will see 	that one portion of your letter I have dealt with in the columns of 	the Harijan.libtech_476_footnoteI 	have purposely refrained from using your name. You will have to lead 	the way by defying the priesthood yourself, and you will find, as I 	have found elsewhere, that the boycotting priests will immediately 	quiet down and want to perform the ceremonies, for they would not 	want to lose the income that they get from the performance of these 	ceremonies. They proclaim the boycott today, because they think that 	thereby they will be able to get more money  from frightened people, 	and you will find too that you will presently get reformers who will 	gladly officiate at these functions. That was what Dr. Rajan was 	able to do.  	Do please continue to write to me whenever you feel you have 	something to say to me.  	As for your personal struggle, no prayashchitta is necessary 	except that you should resolutely live apart from your wife, and you 	will soon find you will be quite all right. You must develop the 	will to enforce this resolution.  	The other thing you ask is much more difficult. You attain to 	‘param’ i.e., truth, by constantly practising it. The 	saying that a man becomes what he thinks is a scientific truth. Here 	thinking does not mean the mental vapours. It means perfect accord 	between thought, speech and deed, and when there is that completely, 	you are within sight of Truth. I wonder if it is clear to you.    
 I am glad you like Miss Lester’s book. She is indeed a good woman. Her address is:   Muriel Lester, Kingsley Hall, Bow, London,  E

         DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO RAMA RAJU      March 	4, 1933 
  	I thank you for your letter. Of course I would gladly discuss the 	problem of untouchability with Pandit Krishnamacharya if he could 	possibly visit Yeravda.  	The difference between Malaviyaji and myself is as you  properly say 	unfortunate, but since the difference was there it is as well that 	it has come out. It promotes healthy public opinion.  Yours 	sincerely,  RAMA 	RAJU 	MASULIPATAM  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 20453   
          MY 	DEAR BOYDlibtech_477_footnote,    LETTER TO BOYD TUCKER      March 	4, 1933 
  	I have your long and good letter but none too long to mar my 	pleasure. You were quite right in writing the letter. The best 	appreciation I could show was to publish the relevant parts of it 	and to offer my own criticism. I had prepared the articlelibtech_478_footnotefor this week’s issue of the Harijan, but it 	had to stand aside for matters more urgent.  I hope however it will 	go in next week. I shall then send you a proof copy and as I have 	said there all I had to in connection with your     
 letter I will not repeat the argument just now. The reference to Gurudev I have not given in the Harijan. I know he has been specially tender towards me of late. Perhaps Truth suffers through his reticence if he has absolutely strong and confirmed views on the question as your letter would suggest he has. I should hold it to be a great tragedy if through the tenderness of friends, untruth had crept into my life or had passed current among the people. If what I hold is truth, it must stand the light of fiercest criticism even of friends who have hitherto worked with me. I have no end to serve but that of Truth. If my defeat means victory of Truth, I would count that defeat itself as victory. I do not regard my judgements as infallible and even though I may be right in 99 cases out of 100, I do not want to trade upon it and assume or expect other people to assume that the 100th judgement is also right. I have for that reason called Gurudev the great sentinel, and I have always appreciated his warnings even when I have not been able to depart from my course by reason of his warnings. They have put me on my mettle and made the . people think and choose. It is not good for individuals or nations to be under the hypnotic influence of any single person. It is a golden cover that hides the face of Truth. You may, if you like, read this to Gurudev, and if he is clear in his mind, after reading the article that you will see in a few days, that he has no doubt in his mind that I am in error, let him issue his warning by way either of a public statement or a letter addressed to me for publication. But if he has any doubt I want the benefit of that doubt because I do not want the people to be confused. As it is, on this temple-entry question I do not hold the field undisputed. They have all kinds of arguments put before them for examination. I do not want Gurudev’s to be one of this crowd of arguments against the simple issue. His must be an overpowering deliverance standing by itself in its strength and originality.
 I am personally not quite sure that Gurudev agrees with you in your attitude, for Santiniketan has its own temple or church or mandir, whatever you like to call it. Where two or three people gather together in a particular place in the name of God to offer worship, it becomes a temple. In Santiniketan we have a humble but  beautiful building where prayers are offered, incenses burnt and sermons given. In Sabarmati we have no building, no walls, but the cardinal points are the walls, the sky is the roof and mother earth is the  floor; nevertheless, the spot that has been selected for the morning and the evening prayers has all the essentials of a temple. But in accordance
 with your letter even that bare ground is a prostitution of religion. Surely, Gurudev will not agree with you in this attitude if I have understood it correctly.
With love from us,
 Yours sincerely,

         MY 	DEAR THADANI,    LETTER TO N. V. THADANI      March 	4, 1933 
  	Though I cannot immediately promote you to the rank of a privileged 	jester, your letter just enables you to be admitted as a candidate 	for that coveted service. You have therefore every reason to 	persevere. You have no reason to fear publicity. When you have 	actually been admitted to that high order, whether you fear or covet 	publicity, it will be there.  	You had only one English educated Indian seriously to tell you that 	untouchability has been from the beginning of time. I discover these 	celebrities practically every day, and, if I was not a child of the 	Mother Gita all the fears that Sastri entertained would have been 	long ago realized in spite of the presence of a privileged jester. 	But thank God, the Gita is a never failing mother, and what 	is more, she is immortal.  Yours 	sincerely,  PRINCIPAL 	THADANI 	RAMJAS 	COLLEGE 	DELHI  From 	a microfilm: 	S.N. 20455      LETTER TO MELISCENT SHEPHARD    March 	4, 1933   MY 	DEAR SISTER,  	I am glad you are back to your work. I did not know that you had 	come.  	Yes, Benarsidas is one of the good men we have. I know him very well 	indeed. Your 	appeal I appreciate though it is superfluous. For I began 
 this work after my own fashion when I was 15 years old and, finding myself in the house of a prostitutelibtech_479_footnoteI discovered suddenly that God had deprived me at that time, to my shame as I then thought and later as I discovered to my great pleasure and the glory of God, of the animal instinct. I knew then how man was misbehaving towards woman, and since then I have never allowed a single opportunity to pass by without making an effort to eradicate the evil. I have written strongly against it, spoken against it still more strongly. My private correspondence is filled with the same thing. At the present moment my activities in that direction must be necessarily circumscribed. But within that limit you may depend upon my doing all I can to deal with the evil. In the Harijan I won’t be able to handle the problem directly. The reason for it is obvious.
 You have no need to apologize for being a foreigner doing this service.  When  people  realize  that   you   have   no   other   motive, but the  simple  motive  of serving  these   fallen   sisters   of   India and through  their  service  also  serving  the  fallen  men  of  India, they will forget that you  are  a  foreigner.  Those  who  have  other ends to serve under the guise of humanitarian service will always be treated as foreigners, whether they wear the white skin or the brown skin.

          DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO L. M. SATOOR      March 	4, 1933 
  	I have your letter and figures of census for which I thank you. In 	the census you are taking in Poona you should have a column for 	giving the sub-caste to which Harijan may belong, and for children 	you should have a column showing who attends school and what 	occupation, if any, the child is following, what he or she is 	earning. There should be a description too of their tenements, the 	condition of water-supply, lighting and streets or roads if they are 	living in separate quarters.  Yours 	sincerely,  SJT. 	L. M. SATOOR  99 MAIN 	STREET, 	CAMP, 	POONA  From 	a microfilm: S.N. 20458      LETTER TO ANNAPURNANANDlibtech_480_footnote    March 	4, 1933  	Tell Shivaprasad to give up reading the newspapers. He can read the 	Gita or Yogavasishtha or the Ramayana—Balkanda or 	Uttarkanda—or the dialogue of Socrates on deathlibtech_481_footnote. 	He should leave worldly affairs solely to God. [From 	Hindi]  Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, Vol. III, p. 	172      WHAT SHOULD HARIJANS DO?     
    one?  (1) What should be done to unite the several sub-castes among Harijans into     In 		large cities where there 		is sewerage 		the Harijan 		brothers are being  
  deprived 	of their livelihood. What should they do under these circumstances?  In 		certain towns at 		the time of 		marriages and 		the like Harijans are not      
 allowed to ride a horse. You have written about the duty of caste Hindus. But please write and say what the Harijans should do under such circumstances.
A. The above three questions have been sent by a Harijan
 brother. All the three are difficult questions. As long as there are several sub-castes among caste Hindus it is very difficult to abolish the different sub-castes among Harijans. But this much is true that if there is a great awakening among Harijans then they can march ahead by leaps and bounds, at once. I should like to see a time when Harijans will be actually far ahead of the caste Hindus. But the question here is about the present condition.
 In the present circumstances, it can only be said that castes considered higher  among  the  Harijans  should  attempt   to   mix with castes deemed lower. For example, the Maharlibtech_482_footnotecaste should mix with the Manglibtech_483_footnotecaste; they should begin to eat  together and intermarry. The Mahars who mix in this way with the Mangs should be fearless and face whatever difficulties they might encounter.
 The second question is common to all. In this age of transition many occupations will vanish and new ones will crop up. It has always been so. The question of sewerage can never arise in villages, Only towns can have sewerage. Scavengers are found in towns. I imagine that where there is sewerage, some scavengers must lose their jobs. It is the duty of the municipality to provide work for such unemployed scavengers. My advice is that weaving or some such occupation  should be learnt by the scavengers. In Gujarat I  noticed  that scavengers who lost their jobs took to weaving. There is no common remedy for all in this matter. It varies with the individual.
 The third question is very difficult. It is implied in the question itself that Harijans are entirely helpless and frightened. Under these circumstances, it can only be said that they should go to the police for help. Dr. Ambedkar told me that since the police belong to higher castes, they do not assist and this is quite possibly true. Therefore, it can only be said that where there is police indifference or opposition and where no help is offered by the caste Hindus and where the Harijans are not sufficiently strong, it is best to have patience. The only consolation is that there are occasions in the life of every person and every community when there is no other course open except to
 
 keep patience. Were it not so, man would become an atheist, and forget God. Therefore, if the Harijans can see no non-violent way out of a difficulty, then they had better pray to God for help.

I may mention that there is absolutely nothing serious about her health just now. She has been removed to a better prison and has been feeling better also after her removal.

   LETTER TO SATIS CHANDRA DAS GUPTA  
 March 5, 1933
 
DEAR SATISBABU,
 I have your letter, and I have also two copies of the Bengali Harijan. I wish my knowledge of Bengali was such as to enable me to read what you have been writing. Sjt. Ghanshyamdas has heard me say that I am studying Bengali. Unfortunately, that is untrue. What I told him was that I was studying Urdu and that if I had the time I had  a great longing for studying Bengali and reviving my knowledge of Tamil. A study of Bengali, as you know, is an old dream. It was about to materialize in 1914, but I had to abruptly leave London for India and the lessons which Mrinalini Devi was giving to me had to be suspended. Therefore when Mahadev has read the paper 1 will send you what he has to say. The cover is certainly attractive. You will let me know what reception it has had from the public. As for the articles to be sent in advance, there are tremendous difficulties, but I shall see what can be done.
 I understand your position about vaccination. Your faith will sustain you.
 You will see how the report that you sent about the Bengali work was interwoven by Shastri into the “Week to Week” columns.libtech_488_footnote
 Have you noticed the ‘comedy of errors, that happened in connection with the information that Hemprabha had given me about Aroon’s father’s death? When I read her letter, I could not believe my eyes. There was nothing wrong with you. You were Aroon’s [sic] father and yet the expression ‘Aroon’s father, was there right enough. I read or showed it to the 9 Sardar, Mahadev and Chhaganlal, and we all came to the conclusion that it must be another Aroon whose father was dead, because later from the language used by Hemprabha it was clear that you were to have seen Aroon’s father before he died, but you and she were too late. I had a vague recollection of Hemprabha having adopted a boy or girl, so I connected Aroon with this adoption, and yet there were not two Aroons to my knowledge. Therefore my letterlibtech_489_footnotelibtech_490_footnoteto Hemprabha baldly referred to a strange Aroon’s father. Your
 
 letter cleared the mystery. And now comes Aroon’s postcard, but of course your letter itself was quite clear that it was your father who had died. If I had remembered, as I should have remembered, that your father was still alive, I would at once have known that Hemprabha meant grandfather instead of father. But at the time I read Hemprabha’s letter I had forgotten altogether that your father was still alive. It was only your letter which revived the recollection.
 I hope you and Hemprabha, Aroon and everybody who read my letter had a hearty laugh at my expense. But if I had been there when my letter was received, I should have joined that hearty laughter, or perhaps called for a laughter at Hemprabha’s expense. I am not writing separately to Aroon. You will therefore share this portion with him. I see that he is still not quite well. And tell Aroon that I shall write to him when he has written to me the letter he has promised.

  	I have read your letter of 24th February from beginning to end with 	greatest attention. Whilst I acknowledge the great pains you have 	bestowed over the composition and the Sanskrit learning which you 	exhibit, you will permit me to say that I miss the application of 	that learning to the reality, and it has been a matter of very deep 	grief to me that in the contact I am having with so many learned 	sanatanists, hardly any one of them has touched the fundamental 	points I have raised. I state them for you.  	Of all those who appear as untouchables in the census figures, who 	are the untouchables by birth? Where is the authority in the Vedas 	for regarding them as such? And if there is none in the Vedas, call 	the later Shastras impose disabilities or create classes not 	contemplated by the Vedas? What is there in the Shastras to justify 	the numerous disabilities which I have described in the pages of the 	Harijan and which are suffered by those who are classified as 	untouchables? 
 You ask me whether I claim to be a sannyasi. I do not. I claim to be a very ordinary Hindu trying to serve the faith of my ancestors in the best manner I know.

   LETTER TO ASHRAM BOYS AND GIRLS  
 March 6, 1933
 BOYS AND GIRLS,
 I got your letter. It is violence to tear sheets from a notebook and use them for writing letters. Do you understand this? Don’t do it again.
 If the secretary or the other office-bearers show themselves unfit or if the members harass them, in either case our progress will be arrested. When you grow up you will behave as you now do. What you do not learn now you will never learn later. I hope you do understand that. Just as mangoes cannot grow on a babul tree, you are not likely to change suddenly after ten years if you cannot work unitedly or behave with self-restraint. You should, therefore, learn to manage your body in a proper manner.

           CHI. 	PREMA,    LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK    YERAVDA MANDIR,libtech_494_footnote  March 	6, 1933 
  	I am starting on this letter at five sharp (Silence Day). Yours was 	the last letter I read from the Ashram post.  	I have not been able to go beyond 75 counts with the slivers which 	you sent. Yarn of 75 counts should be regarded as very much below 	the mark. I have calculated the count on the basis of the figure you 	give for weight. The scales here are not good enough for  weighing 	with any minute accuracy. I do believe, however, that if my hand was 	all right I would be able to go up to 100 counts.  	What you write to me regarding Sushila is simply incompre- hensible 	to me. I am not aware of having ignored her in theleast. She herself 	made me feel that there was no need to inquire after her or    
 advise her. So I did not ask her any detailed questions. Tell her this. How could I know that like you she also craved for a show of love and for compliments? I ought to have known that your friend would be like you. Isn’t that what you suggest? But probably Sushila herself will not admit this. Isn’t one Prema enough for me? There are other Premas, of course, but they are all different from one another and from you. However, I will be more careful in future.
 How old is Vijaya? How does she behave? Train Lakshmi thoroughly.
 I also suspect something from the fact that Durga’s boils cannot still be cured. She used to write to me regularly, but she never writes now. From that, too, I suspect that she is hiding something. Inquire and find out if she is suffering from some other disease.
 A diet of raw vegetables and dates is bound to help you to reduce your weight. You should also include in it two and a half ounces of unboiled milk. Among raw vegetables, you may eat tomatoes, radishes, carrots, lettuce, etc. You should exclude salt. You should take two or three lemons with water or with dates. Probably it will be better to take it with water. If, however, it sours your teeth you may not take it. You can also mix soda bicarb with it.
 I cannot discuss the question asked by Rajaji and others. That would be violating truth. It can be done when a suitable opportunity arises. My writings, however, contain a reply to every doubt.
 I will admit all the shortcomings of the Ashram which you may point out. But you will help me better if you also suggest suitable remedies at the same time. Even if, however, you cannot do that, I must have your criticism. I use my brain as much as I can. I know this: the Ashram’s shortcomings are not its own, but mine. If the potter makes an ill-shaped pot, is that the fault of the pot or of the potter? I literally believe what I have said, and the shortcomings of the Ashram, therefore, are a measure of my ignorance. But notwithstan- ding its shortcomings, I like the Ashram, for I am not ready to say positively that I do not like myself. I like myself in the measure that I do not feel the sense of “I”, and ceaselessly strive to overcome what still remains of that sense.

   LETTER TO CHHOTUBHAI PATEL  
 March 6, 1933
 BHAI CHHOTUBHAI,
 I got your letter. Indulgence in moderation is less harmful, but brahmacharya is the best. The atman is not a body and can exist without the body, as God does. That which is bodiless can have no need for sex-gratification, and, therefore, one who has awakened from the state of ignorance also can have none. If it is one’s dharma to shed ignorance, sex-gratification is contrary to dharma and, therefore, harmful.
The earth is certainly ever alive, but man who is of earth is not.
He must perish.
 I cannot say whether at present people are rising or falling, It seems to me to be a futile question.
 It is certainly true that we have no strength of our own except what God gives us and we must, therefore, admit it.
 He who has real humility has risen far above the man who is proud, for humility is truth and pride is falsehood.
 One should not brush the teeth with a babul stick after a meal, but one must clean them with a finger and gargle well.
 The future will show what relations you will maintain with the Ashram after your marriage. It is needless to think of it Just now.
 I cannot say that I immediately recognized you on reading your letter. I cannot say that with regard to anybody.

 CHI. PRABHUDAS,
 I have your letter. I understand what you say about the girl. I am not likely to be satisfied with any sort of girl for you. Gomati had approved of her. She believed that the girl did not belong to the modh sub-caste. The only point was that if an educated girl is desirable for a match, though rather grown-up, she should be accepted and the objection on the ground of her being a Gujarati or belonging to the Bania caste, should be waived. I have no intention whatever of doing anything without your approval.
 You have not said in your letter anything about honey or the school. Do they make honey there? From what do they make it? What is the quality of teaching? Who are the people who are learning?
 I hope you have not completely given up your writing work or your study, have you?
 I do not want to burden you with any responsibility in Almora. Let the Shail Ashram remain just a  dharmashalalibtech_495_footnotefor the present. We will see later what should be done.
 I, too, would welcome keeping the Chandradutta brothers. If they are good men, no harm will be done. It would of course be good if Mahavirprasad accepts them. I think it would not be proper to give a big salary for the care of the Shail Ashram. But in this matter, too, Narandas will know better. If you trust his decision, you will be at peace and so will I.

  	Your letter. This issuelibtech_496_footnotelibtech_497_footnoteis better though there is still room for improvement. 	It is not necessary to take everything from English nor is it 	necessary to translate in full all that is taken. Some article may 	deserve full translation, another only a summary, yet another may be 	rejected; in brief, the Hindi readers should get all that is worth 	giving. Items published in other journals too should be screened. 	But sometimes those translations may be faulty. For purity, 	simplicity and restraint our translation should read like original 	writing. As for the translated items appearing in newspapers, they 	need not be included in Hindi Harijan if the translations are 	accurate. I am arranging to send English articles in advance. 	Satisbabu wants them and so  does Ganesan. I shall see what can be 	done. Why do you not include articles by Hindi writers? But they 	should not be mere essays. They should contain either the views or 	arguments of some sanatanists and answers to them or a discussion of 	problems faced by the workers or an account of the hardships 	suffered by Harijans. All the articles, in short, must be written 	with a view to solving the current and immediate problems. An 	abstract of the activities in Provinces should be a must every time.

You are at liberty to show this letter to her and you will please tell me all about her from time to time. From her talks with me she led me to understand that she had great regard for you, but that regard has very little value because she was leading an altogether false life when she entertained this regard for you.

   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI  
 Silence Day, 5.25 [Before March 8, 1933]libtech_510_footnote
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 Send Prabhavati the volume of Speeches. She has written to tell me that she had asked for it but has not received it.
 Probably you  know  Parachure  Shastri. He has  once stayed in the Ashram. He is suffering from leprosy, but the symptoms may be considered to have dried up now. He is in jail and will be released on the 8th. He is a good man, a man of renunciation. He knows Sanskrit, is married, and has three children. The children are foolish. The wife is weak in the brain. She had once been admitted to  a lunatic asylum. I think we should keep him. Give him one room. Kaka says he should be given Mirabehn’s room. The wife will of course live in the women’s wing. The children could be kept anywhere. Parachure Shastri will observe the modern hygienic rules for lepers. That is, he will not touch anyone and will keep his clothes separate. It will be necessary to send his meals to his room. Probably he will live on milk and fruit, or on a mixture of fresh milk and neem leaves. He can do a great deal of work sitting in his room. He will teach Sanskrit. He can teach even Marathi there. He will arrive there by the 10th or the 12th. He will presently go to see his wife. I will know from him what he intends to do if his wife is against his
 
 joining the Ashram. He spins a great deal. He has spun quite a lot in the jail. He will spin there, too. He was in fact a teacher in Chinchavad.   I do not think I have any further suggestion to make. I take it that no one will take fright by this news. Leprosy does not spread through the air. Personally, I doubt if it is contagious. In our country, lepers freely move about everywhere. But we should observe  the  prohibitation about physical contact with a leper since that would be the right thing for us to do. We cannot completely ignore modern science. Shastri himself willingly observes that prohibition. If he employs  the  remedies I have suggested, he may even be cured of his leprosy. I have assumed that you yourself will not be reluctant to take him in. If, however, you are, send me a telegram. Ask the Managing Committee, too. It is better to consult the other permanent inmates of the Ashram as well. In fact I feel that it is my dharma to ascertain the opinion of every member in this matter. I took this step only after all of us here unanimously agreed on it. But I do not worry about it. I felt it is to be my clear dharma to take him in. He had in fact arrived with the purpose of living in the Ashram but had to leave because his wife was against it. I think we cannot reject him. However, there may be room for difference of opinion in this matter. Since he had left the Ashram once, we cannot say without further deliberation that it is our dharma to take him back again. Hence, on getting this letter, think over the matter. First yourself, then the Committee, and after that the rest. If your own view is against taking him in, I should not send him there, nor if the Committee is against it, nor if the old-time members are against it. I would not consider it essential to seek the consent of those who have joined the Ashram only for a short period. However, it would be proper to discuss the matter with all the members. I feel that  I have abused the freedom which I obtained from you. Such things come naturally to me, but I have no right, without the co-workers’ consent to send anyone who might be a burden on them. I followed the same rule at Phoenix. Once, when I was practicing there, someone suffering from a dangerous disease turned up and I made Ba nurse him. I am nearing the end of my life doing such things but have still not changed my ways. That is, I act on the assumption that the co-workers, particularly those who are very close to me, will as a matter of course do what I do. Let us believe and hope that this will prove to be my last misdeed. I will settle the matter perfectly well with Parachure Shastri. Hence nobody should come to a decision on the basis of my assurance to him. After considering the matter
 
 independently and examining the Ashram’s dharma in this case send me a telegram whether thedecision is ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Let  no  one believe that I will be shocked, whatever the decision. I had expected that I would have to give but one sheet of paper to this subject, but now it seems that I would instead be giving five. I went on writing as ideas came to me one after another. In the matter of observing one’s dharma, taking a decision in a hurry is harmful and ought to be avoided. It implies self-conceit. You will see from this something of the present state of my mind. My fitness to think about anything except what relates to Harijan service seems to be fast leaving me. To think about other things or to do anything or speak about anything else has become painful to me. I am going through  painful experiences which I find impossible to describe. Even if I wished to describe them, I have no time to do so. But no more of this now. I feel perfectly at ease in pouring out my heart to you. I believe you have the capacity to respond to such things. If you have followed all I have said and wish to give the letter to others to read, I will have no objection. If you feel that what I have written is strange, keep the letter with you after reading it. I will explain it if we meet some day. What I have said is nothing mysterious. It is easy enough to understand, but it gives a glimpse into what agony one, who unswervingly follows the path of dharma, has to endure. I do feel that if someone who has not associated himself with my life were to read this, it would do much harm.
 Tell Parasaram firmly what your decision is. I am writing to him. If he wants to leave despite your being straightforward in dealing with him, let him do so. If he wishes to stay in spite of it, no objection need be made. There is no room for charity in the sphere of dharma. It would be easy to acquiesce in it if we transgress the proper limit of ahimsa. But it becomes difficult to do so when in the name of ahimsa one shows undeserved compassion and is thereby guilty of a subtle form of violence. Just as we do not indulge an invalid’s fancies so also we need not indulge the fancies of a person who violates the rules. This is the way to put an end to Parasaram’s noisy complaints.
 I think it will be difficult to arrange for Kusum’s trip to Almora. At present, there are just no such facilities there. I think it will be difficult to look after her there. We cannot put the burden of doing so on Prabhudas, nor on Navin. If her disease gets aggravated, who will look after her there? It might be possible to send her either to Deolai
 or Matheran. Whether or not she can be sent to Deolali, will have to be considered. I do not think it proper for the whole family to  go. Beyond this my brain refuses to work just now.
 I have already written to you about Lakshmi. Lakshmidas will certainly come there. Perhaps Devdas also will come. Rajaji and Shankerlal are here at present.
   [PS.]  BAPU    Monday, 5.25  	One thing was left out in the letter for the children. Some of 
  	them write to me to say that they have got tired of the agricultural 	work. Tell them that this does not become them. A duty once 	undertaken cannot be abandoned. Even music tires one so long as one 	has not learnt it well. Those who have learnt agricultural work 	well, do not give it up. If agricultural work were not interesting, 	millions in the world would not engage themselves in it. It does 	require hard work, but hard work is interesting, not indolence. 	Moreover, the hard work is only physical. But our bodies love ease 	and comfort and therefore we avoid hard work and in consequence 	suffer from diseases. I therefore hope that the children will not 	tire of agricultural work. Besides, the mother Gita also 	teaches us that it is in doing our duty that we find pleasure and 	agricultural work is one of our duties. I have looked into the 	result of the yarn-test competition. It is disappointing. Only one 	sample bears the mark ‘excellent’. The mark against two is 	‘bad’. All other samples fall short in both respects. This 	defect  must  be remedied. Ask those whose yarns have gone through 	the test and the others also, to be vigilent. Spinning good quality 	yarn that is even and strong, requires nothing more than careful 	attention. If the sliver is of inferior quality, the yarn may fall 	short in respect of . . .libtech_511_footnotelibtech_512_footnotebut 	it will certainly not be uneven or weak. I still consider the count 	of the samples low. The quality of slivers is likely to be at fault 	in that. It does not matter if we produce a smaller quantity of 	slivers and yarn, but what we do produce must be of the finest 	quality. Pay attention to this subject and induce others to do the 	same. Wake up all of them. In.  	. .libtech_513_footnotefor 	achieving perfection, everyone must acquire speed and . . .libtech_514_footnoteIt would be good if they acquire speed in carding and 	ginning also.

   LETTER TO F. MARY BARR AND DUNCAN GREENLEES  
      CHI. 	MARY AND DUNCAN,  March 	8, 1933 
  	I like your letter very much indeed. Before I argue to the contrary, 	let me say what I have told Narandas and I think I made clear to 	both of you, that you should not be treated as the other learners 	who come to the Ashram, that you should take only such part in the 	Ashram work as you like and can digest and that you should use your 	time as may seem most profitable to you from your own standpoint.  	Now for my own opinion. The Ashram is a place where the idea is to 	enforce literally the maxim ‘to labour is to pray’. This labour 	was interpreted by Thoreau and Tolstoy to mean physical labour and 	Tolstoy adopted Bondaref’s maxim of bread labour being God’s law 	for all mankind. I read the same thing in the third chapter of the 	Gita.  I have tested the truth of the interpretation in my 	own life and in the lives of many companions and I have felt that 	our lives have been incomplete and unsatisfying exactly to the 	extent that we have failed to carry out the interpretation in 	practice. Therefore I would say that, so long as the routine of the 	Ashram appears to be a slavish following of it, the spirit of tile 	Ashram is not imbibed. I confess unhesitatingly that so few have 	imbibed the spirit. Many follow the routine mechanically and, 	therefore, slavishly. I do not grumble over the mechanical 	following, because even that is better than people idling away their 	time and I am not without hope that even those who are mechanically 	following the routine will some day detect the spirit and the beauty 	behind it. So many Englishmen and women, especially missionaries, 	make, in my opinion, the tremendous mistake  of directing the 	activity of others without themselves taking a direct part in it. 	They, therefore, remain untouched by the activity itself and often 	become blind guides. As I am dictating this, illustrations from life 	crowd in upon my mind. I would, therefore, say that if you can 	appreciate and understand the spirit of my remarks and feel the 	truth of them, then follow the routine patiently, intelligently, 	whole-heart- edly, till it becomes a part of your nature, lies light 	upon your mind and seems to speak to you its message. Then, but not 	tillthen, are you really able to write anything serious for public 	service. Not even every good thought is worth giving to the world 	unless it is repeatedly tested on the anvil of experience. All true 	labour is both contagious and 
 infectious. I wonder if I have driven my meaning home. If I have not, you must reject all my argument without the slightest hesitation and do exactly as you feel you should, so as to get the best out of your experience of the Ashram.
 With loving blessings from

  	I have your letter, being your answer to “As They See Us”libtech_518_footnote. It is a very good reply, if my assumption is correct 	that the whole of the balance after deducting overhead charges has 	gone into the pockets of the Harijans. Your letter is going in this 	week, but I would like you to let me have the details showing how 	the disbursements were made.  	As to the reply received by you from the Government regarding the 	supply of Harijan to prisoners, I must not deal with it 	through the Harijan. You too may regard the matter as closed.

         DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO P. RAMAMURTIlibtech_519_footnote      March 	8, 1933 
  	I thank you for your letter and I am glad you have written to me. I 	wish you would care to read all the numbers of the Harijan  and 	I think that most of your doubts will be solved. You will find in 	them that I have unhesitatingly said that all that is bad about 	varnashrama and caste should be wholly removed. Temple-entry is  	certainly coming much sooner than you expect. It is the centre of 	reform because it would be a visible sign to the millions that 	untouchability is gone. Therefore we must prosecute the reform 	whether the vast mass of caste Hindus come round or not.  	Anti-untouchability leagues are, I think, working satisfactorily. A 	great deal is being done by them for the educational advancement      
 and you should study the columns of the Harijan to note the progress in that direction. I think that you are not doing justice to Sjt. Nageswar Rao when you say that nothing but platform lectures are being given in Andhradesa. But I am writing for fuller particulars.
 If you were to start the leagues and the Birla Committeelibtech_520_footnotelibtech_521_footnotewere to furnish the funds, you won’t call that self-reliance. As a matter of fact, what you need is not money but men who having received education would take it to the humbler Harijans. My advice to the  Harijan  youths, therefore, is to take up the reform energetically among the poorest.
 I do not know the effect of the Madras Services Commission. You will perhaps enlighten me on the point, but Harijan graduates and other highly educated Harijans have limitless scope for serving fellow-Harijans.
 If there is no Telugu newspaper specially devoted to Harijans, I suppose it is because there are very few literate Harijans. Before, therefore, you think of starting a paper, all the educated Harijans should spread themselves among the illiterate Harijans and impart instruction to them. Every educated Harijan should, therefore, become a walking newspaper, and this you can supplement by issuing leaflets from time to time as they may be demanded.
Please keep yourself in touch with me.
 Yours sincerely,

   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI  
 March 8, 1933
 CHI. NARANDAS,
I got your big packet of mail.
 My views about the teaching of English, it may be said, have changed to a certain extent. I feel that the older women in the Ashram should be permitted to learn what they wish to. They feel their deficiency at every step, and particularly, in our circumstances, their
 
 ignorance of English. They don’t mind being ignorant of arithmetic nor do they mind their indifferent Gujarati, but they feel unhappy that they don’t know English. Our connections with Englishmen will continue, ought to continue, and, therefore, we shall also continue to use the English language. Hence the women feel that if they know a little English, they will be able to use it every now and then. This argument is not altogether tenable, but there is enough truth in it to make them wish to learn English. It is certainly not immoral to learn English. I think that, if the women do not feel interested in any other subject, it would be good to teach them even English to make them study-minded. It is desirable that the older women should become interested in study, no matter how. It is also desirable that they should increase their knowledge. I, therefore, think that we should provide whatever facility we can to any older woman who may wish to learn English. Please point out to me any weakness that you may see in this reasoning. I will try to explain again.
 I see from Kikabhai’s letter that a large crowd of Harijans will be attending Lakshmi’s wedding. I think that Jamna and you are the right persons to give away the bride. I hope Jamna does not harbour the prejudice of untouchability in her heart. Don’t make the Harijans who may attend sit apart from the others. Since their proportion will be large enough for the gathering, serve them some fruit as refresh- ment, as I have suggested. I suggest copra and raisins. If possible, I will write something to be read out to the assembled guests and en- close it with this letter.libtech_522_footnoteYou will have to give some dresses to Lakshmi as a gift from the Ashram. Think over this. If you can, see Ba and ask her advice. I should be happy if she gives one of her saris, a new one or an almost new one. If she has preserved any jewellery, she may give some of it too. Tell the Superintendent that you wish to see her specially for this reason. If he permits you, well and good, if he does not, don’t mind. Discuss with the women this question of what to give to Lakshmi. See that we omit to do nothing which would be proper on such an occasion. I will write to you again if I think of anything more. You can ignore any of my suggestions which you don’t think appropriate.
I have replied to Parachure Shastri. Everything will depend on
 your wire.
 
 I have received Kellogg’s book. Gangabehn and Sharda have arrived here. They have not seen me yet. Gangabehn will not be able to do so. Sharda will see me on Saturday if she is here on that day.
 You did the right thing in keeping Lakshmi’s younger sister with Anasuyabehn. I see that Dudabhailibtech_523_footnotehas  stayed  on.  Dahibehnlibtech_524_footnoteshould be welcomed if she comes. You did right in agreeing to pay her the expenses of her journey.
 For the present, at any rate, Anandi seems to be completely free from danger. I will give her some work every day. She lives on milk and fruit. For some time she must remain here. You may ask Lakshmidas about the remedies which are being tried for her. They will be useful to others, too. It cannot be said, though, that they will agree with everyone. But they will certainly do no harm.
 I have no fear about your health so long as your diet includes milk and curds. But I should certainly like you to exclude gram from it. It makes the mental work you are doing more difficult. The best food for mental workers is milk and fruit. If you eat uncooked cabbage, it should be tender. But this is not necessary if you eat it boiled. It would be better if you drink milk without boiling it.
 Jamna should take sun-bath, get her body massaged with oil, do pranayama systematically and, for food, drink milk and eat papaya, raisins and, if she wishes, some vegetable. I believe she will be all right  if she restricts her diet to these things.

   MESSAGE ON WEDDING OF LAKSHMI AND MARUTI  
 March 8, 1933 I feel a little unhappy that neither Ba nor I will be present in the Ashram on the occasion of the wedding of Lakshmi and Marutilibtech_525_footnotelibtech_526_footnote, but I
think that is ignorant love. One should feel happy wherever devotion
to  dharma may  make  it  necessary  for  one  to   be.  Since   one who
 
 
 follows dharma should never wish that things should be otherwise than they are, he can have no cause to feel unhappy.
 Moreover, when so many elders and friends, men and women, will be assembling to give their blessings, Ba’s presence or  mine should not be considered at all essential.
 Lakshmi was of course eager that Ba and I should be present at her wedding. So was Chi. Maruti. I could understand their desire. But all of us felt that the marriage should take place without delay, and hence I advised both the bride and the bridegroom to have the wedding as soon as possible and they accepted my advice. Lakshmi has been brought up in the Ashram since her childhood. But we have not been able to educate and train her as well as the Ashram and I would have liked to do. We did not, therefore, think it desirable to keep a girl in the bloom of youth unmarried for very long after betrothal. The fact that Chi. Lakshmi is getting married does not mean that her education will stop. I regard Maruti as a very worthy young man. He is a man of self-control. He has received training at the hands of Bhai Lakshmidas and Velabehn. He realizes the responsibility he is undertaking. He will not only be a husband to Lakshmi, but will also be a friend and teacher to her. There can be no doubt that, if this marriage is successful, it will benefit both Harijans and Hinduism a great deal. Looked at from this point of view, this marriage is of great importance and makes the responsibility of both correspondingly greater.
 Chi. Maruti and Chi. Lakshmi were betrothed some years ago. It was a big problem for the Ashram to whom Lakshmi should be married. We thought that, having regard to the training she had received in the Ashram, she would be happy only if she got a partner who had received a similar training. The Ashram believes in the principle of varnashrama and tries to follow it as well as it can. I cannot speak for all, but I have often stated that I myself believe that in the present age all Hindus can, and do, belong to one varna only. If we wish to revive the varnashrama system, we shall have to start with a clean slate. This being my view, it was my duty to find a suitable husband for Lakshmi. Velabehn came to my help and suggested Maruti’s name. Lakshmidas also liked the idea. I put the suggestion to Lakshmi, and she, too, accepted it. Her father also gave his consent and the two were betrothed. In my opinion all that we did was in conformity with dharma. I regard marriage too as a protective hedge
 for dharma, and we should hope that the bride and the bridegroom also will regard it in the same light.
 This marriage has no connection with the present movement. Mixed marriages like this one are in no way a part of the movement for the removal of untouchability. This marriage is a recognition of the point of view of one who believes in all the various ideals of the Ashram. I hope that no one will misunderstand its  significance because it is taking place at the present time when the movement for removal of untouchability is going on and because it is inspired by one who is the chief leader of that movement. I do not hold up this marriage as an example for anybody to follow. I regard marriage as a matter of the parents’ and their children’s free will. I believe that there is ample support for this view in Hinduism. However, it has no connection with the problem of the removal of untouchability. The question belongs to another field of reform in Hinduism.

   DRAFT CONSTITUTION OF THE HARIJAN SEVAK SANGH  
 [March 9, 1933]libtech_527_footnote
 The following resolution was adopted on behalf of what are known as caste Hindus by a meeting of their representatives from all India held at Bombay under the presidentship of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya on 25th September, 1932.libtech_528_footnote
 This Conference resolves that henceforth, amongst Hindus, no one shall be regarded as an untouchable by reason of his birth and those who have been so regarded hitherto will have the same rights as the other Hindus in regard to the use of public wells, public roads and other public institutions. This right shall have statutory recognition at the first opportunity and shall be one of the
 
 
 earliest acts of the swaraj Parliament, if it shall not have received such recognition before that time.
 It is further agreed that it shall be the duty of all Hindu leaders to secure, by every legitimate and peaceful means, an early removal of all social disabilities now imposed by custom upon the so-called untouchable classes including the bar in respect of admission to temples.
This was followed up by a public meeting convened by the
 Hindu leaders from all parts of the country and held in Bombay on the 30th September, under the presidentship of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, at which following resolution among others was passed:
 This public meeting of the Hindus resolves that an All-India Antiuntouchability League, with its headquarters at Delhi and branches in different provincial centres, be established for the purpose of carrying on propaganda against untouchability and that for this purpose the following steps should be immediately taken:
  All 	public wells, 	dharmsalas, roads, 	schools, crematoriums, 	burn- ing-ghats, etc., be 	declared open to 	depressed classes.  All 	public temples be 	opened to 	members of 	depressed classes. 	Provided that 	no compulsion 	or force 	shall be used 	with regard to 	(a) and 	(b), but 	peaceful persuasion will 	be adopted 	as the only means. 
 This public meeting of Hindus appeals to the Hindu community to collect as large an amount as possible to be used for the removal of untoucha-bility and cognate objects and for this purpose authorizes the President and  [the] Secretary to take all necessary steps.
In pursuance of the said resolutions a society, named the All-
 India Anti-untouchability League subsequently named as Harijan Sevak Sangh was duly formed and a constitution was adopted by it at [Delhi] on 26th [October, 1932].
 It was then considered advisable to frame a fuller constitution and the following was finally adopted at a meeting of the central board of All-India Harijan Sevak Sangh held at Delhi on . . . superseding the previous constitution.

  In 	furtherance of 	its objects 	the H. 	S. S. will seek to 	establish contact 	with caste Hindus 	throughout India 	and show them 	that untouchability 	as it is practised 	in Hindu 	society is 	repugnant to 	the Shastras 	and to 	the best 	instinct of 	humanity, and 	it will 	also seek to serve 	Harijans so as to promote 	their moral, 	social  and  material 	welfare.  The 	affairs of 	the Sangh 	shall be managed 	by a Central 	Board constituted 	as hereinafter provided. The 	Central Board 	shall consist of the following members and

 MY DEAR ABHYANKAR,
 
 Here is copy of my further correspondence with Sjt. Chhap- khane.libtech_529_footnoteI suggest your seeking him and fixing up whatever is possible.

    MY 	DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS,  	The English Harijan has become self-supporting already. The 	subscriptions received to date from street sales and annual 	subscribers leave a balance without the aid of the Rs. 1044 from the 	Central Boardlibtech_532_footnotelibtech_533_footnote. This money can, therefore, now be refunded. Will you 	kindly tell me how you would want this money to be sent to  you?  I 	understand that you have to pay something to the Maharashtra Board. 	My enquiry as to the method of refunding the money is merely with a 	view to saving commission on money order, draft or cheque.  	Arrangements have been made to issue a Gujarati Harijan also. 	It is being issued from Poona. The Bombay Board has guaranteed the      
 cost for three months in the event of any loss being incurred, but I have no such fear.

My own position 	is quite clear. I was wholly uninterested in the number of seats 	reserved for untouchables or depressed classes. Once the principle 	of reservation was conceded, my own position was that the more they 	got the better it was for them and for Hinduism and, therefore, for 	the whole of India from every point of view. If untouchables are a 	part of ourselves, what can be grander than that we reserve seats 	for them without any      Ghose 	as its 	president” appointed by 	the All-Parties 	Bengali Hindu Conference held 	on the January 11, 	1933, in 	the hall of 	the British Indian 	Association. The 	memorandum inter alia 	said: “It 	will thus be 	seen that the 	caste Hindus of 	Bengal are 	already smarting under a 	sense of injustice; and the Prime Minister’s acceptance of the 	Poona Pact comes as 	a sensible 	addition to their 	grievances. Upon 	the basis 	of the 	facts set 	forth above, it 	is submitted that 	the Poona Pact 	did not fulfil the 	conditions for 	a substituted 	agreement laid down 	in the Prime Minister’s 	Award, and that, 	therefore, the 	Prime Minister has 	ample justification for 	re-considering his 	assent to 	the same” 	(S.N. 20341 ) . 
 reservation. That to my mind would be the very best method of killing the spirit of difference. I wholly dissent from the view that the principle  of  separation  is  left  intact  in  the  Yeravda  Pactlibtech_536_footnotelibtech_537_footnote.  On  the contrary, the principle of joint election has been the main feature of the Yeravda Pact so far as the political side is concerned. That the candidates for joint election have to be selected by Harijan electors in the first instance is surely no drawback, if we have faith in ourselves and in our regard for them, and if all the four candidates selected happen to be anti-Hindu reactionaries it would be to me proof positive that during the period of grace we had failed to command their affection or esteem and we would have to thank our stars if we have to elect from among reactionary candidates. I do not in any way share your fear that depressed class members will not do justice to  the Hindu or the national cause. Nor have I any fear that they will not be able to discharge their proper function as representatives of the  people. Should it prove otherwise it will mean that we are not fit for swaraj.
 All things considered, therefore, I fear that I can be no party to the revision of the Pact, and in any case I am only one of the parties concerned, and my opinion will be valueless if all the other parties consent to or desire revision of the Pact in the direction suggested by the British Indian Association.
 As I do not wish to compromise your position in any way, I have not entered into a public discussion of your position nor will I do so now unless you wish me to. The very first person I wrote to was, I think, Dr. Bidhan Roy, and he told me that he was seeing all the interested parties and that he would write to me. I have not heard from him since. I am now in your hands.

   LETTER TO SATIS CHANDRA DAS GUPTA  
 March 9, 1933
 DEAR SATISBABOO,
 I have your letter giving me the contents of the two issues of the Bengali Harijan. You will see the notelibtech_538_footnotethat is to appear in the ensuing number of the Harijan.
 I note what you say about smallpox. I do not know however whether it is a useful thing for us to have statistics about  the distribution of smallpox among different castes.
 I am glad you are keeping in touch with sanatanists. That they will not listen to the other things until we give up temple-entry is well known. My suggestion is before them that they should start their own organizations and take up the other items. If they don’t, it shows the hypocrisy of the whole thing.
 As to varnashrama, I do mean that today if we must classify the whole of Hindus according to varna, there is only one varna possible, and that is Shudra. Acceptance of the fourth varna by all will repre- sent not only the true state of Hindu society, but it will at one stroke level down all distinctions of high and low. That does not prevent anybody from attaining divine or any other knowledge, but it does mean that all live by their labour and all become entitled therefore to nothing more than simple maintenance. That in my opinion is varna dharma in a nutshell. That Hinduism has never lived up to it perfectly is true, but in my opinion it is equally true that Hinduism has in its purest period consciously lived up to it with success.
 Yours sincerely,

         DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO VITHAL K. JOSHI      March 	9, 1933 
  	I have your letter. I have heard from Sjt. Chhapkhane.libtech_539_footnoteHe gives a categorical reply confirming Sjt. 	Athavale’s and he also suggests that you should have gone to Sjt. 	Chhapkhane to have the matter cleared up. I suggest your doing it. 	Copies of the balance of corres- pondence are being forwarded to 	Sjt. Abhyankar. Of course there is no question of a court case. I 	can only plead with those who hold the money, but it is difficult 	for me to believe that a man like Sjt. Chhap- khane could be guilty 	of giving a false version of what happened during my visit to 	Sangli. No theory can be built upon Sjt. Gangadhar Rao’s 	recollection. He does not say anything with confidence and it is not 	possible for anyone to recollect events that happened so many years 	ago. Therefore, unless there is unimpeachable evidence to the 	contrary, Sjt. Chhapkhane’s word must be taken, and in that event 	I can only plead with him to use some part of the money at least in 	connection with Harijan work.

        MY 	DEAR N.libtech_540_footnote,    LETTER TO N.      March 	9, 1933 
  	I had hoped to hear from you today. I had your note scribbled on the 	back of the telegram that was received by you. You were right in 	refusing the Rs. 25. I did not like the subscription to your note. 	“Your son” looks unnatural and theatrical. If the truth has 	really dawned on you, you must realize the enormity of the past 	wrong and     
 you ought to shed all hysteria and unnaturalness. You can only beco- me my daughter if you would be good as you have promised to me.
I had letters from S.libtech_541_footnoteand Sir M.libtech_542_footnotelibtech_543_footnoteI am therefore writing to Sir
 M. a letter giving him the purport of your confession and your promise, naturally withholding the names you have given me and I am sending a similar letter to S. That is right, is it not? S. adds in his letter that he would be delighted if you came under my guidance and utilized your services.
 May God bless you and give you strength to keep your  promise.

  DEAR 	FRIEND,  	I thank you for your letter about N. She was with me for a few days 	and I regret to have to report to you that her record is not what 	you describe. Bit by bit she made her confession and it made  a 	ghastly story. She seems to have led a most extravagant and immoral 	life, even from tender years. She was open to the advances of 	practically any person, and she was no better after her acceptance 	of Hindu religion. She has debts amounting to nearly Rs. 10,000 	spread over Europe and India. She has travelled under a false name. 	The only thing I am able to say in her favour is that she has been 	quite frank with me in her recital of her recklessnesses, though, as 	I have said, they came bit by bit in answer to my cross-examination. 	She has professed penitence and made me a definite promise to say 	good-bye to her past life. I have told her that I could not take her 	on trust but that if she proved true to her promise I would not 	hesitate to defend her and to guide her. I do not know what capacity 	she has still left for controlling herself and keeping her promises.  	In giving you this painful story of her confession I am betra- ying 	no confidence, for, she was to have published a confession much like 	this immediately on her reaching Bangalore. She was also to give     
 up the boarding house and with her son become a beggar relying purely upon a forgiving world’s charity and was to live in a corner in Harijan quarters the simplest possible life giving up the governess and letting her baby son share the privilege of her penitent life.
 There are some further details, some other particulars of her life, which I may not disclose, nor, so far as I am aware, will she.
 Her confession has made me sad. I have had many boys and girls making their confessions to me, but it has never been my mis- fortune to come across a case like N.’s. But I have no right to judge her. Judgment is in the hands of God. Being myself in need of pity from the world I only pity her and love to help her to the extent of my ability. I felt drawn to her when she wrote to me announcing her decision to fast with me if I had commenced the fast in the begin-ning of the year. I had warned her against it and the correspondence be- came lengthened. I had hoped that she would become an excellent member of the army of Harijan servants and her letters give all that promise.
 I thank you for your personal wishes for me and kind thoughts about me.

  	I thank you for your letter of the 10th February, reminding me of a 	quotation from “Santi Parva”.  Yours 	sincerely,  SJT. 	R. RAMAMOORTHY  C/O 	SJT. 	RAMACHANDRA RAO 	1 RAVANA 	IYER ST.  T. MADRAS   From 	a microfilm: 	S.N. 20508      LETTER TO PANCHANAN TARKARATNA    March 	9, 1933  DEAR 	PANDITJI, I 	was amazed to receive your undated letter.  	So far as your son’s visit is concerned, he was to come to me not 	as one of the Shastri disputants but as one desirous of 	answering my questions, enlightening me and to this end seeing me 	from day to day for 10 days or longer if necessary, and he was to 	come to me as your representative even as you had comelibtech_544_footnotewithout imposing any condi- tions on me. It surprises 	me that now you should describe his coming to me as one of the 	disputants in the nature of fulfilment of your promise. Secondly, 	from the very commencement of the discussions, untouchability as it 	is practised today was the subject-matter of discussionlibtech_545_footnote, and I have a letter written by Pandits on the very 	date that they came to the effect that that was the common ground 	between them and me. You, your son or anybody can see the original 	docu- ment in my possession. But the Pandits had imposed another 	condi- tion which they thought I would never accept, but in order 	not to miss the discussion with them when they had come as far as 	the jail gate, I      12-1-1933 
 waived my objection and accepted their condition retaining the words “as at present practised”. Still they would not come. I cannot help saying that this was unreasonable, discourteous and unworthy of learned men. Of all the painful episodes that I have  had  the misfortune to face in my contact with Shastris, this was the most painful.
 Of the other parts of your letter I desire to say nothing beyond this that I am unable to endorse your interpretation of the Shastras as being repugnant to common sense, universal morals and contrary to the interpretation of the Shastras by Pandits having no less learning and authority than the opposite school and in the presence of such a conflict of interpretation you will not blame me if I accept that which is more consistent with my moral sense.
 As to your proposed fast, whilst I should deplore it if you ever came to undertake it, such fasts are an everyday occurrence in Hinduism and have always to be welcomed when they come from the purity of one’s heart and without anger or malice.
 You would not write as you have done about the two Bills now pending before the Legislature if you had carefully studied the contents and application of these Bills.libtech_546_footnotelibtech_547_footnoteIn my opinion they constitute no interference with anyone’s religion or conscience. One Bill takes untouchability out of the domain of civil law which is what you and I and everybody else should desire, and the other ensures the free exercise of conscience by all, whereas today the conscience of a growing number of people is constrained.
 Yours sincerely,

   LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI  
 March 9, 1933
 
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 
 I send with this my replylibtech_550_footnoteto the question asked by Mary and Duncan. Read and think over it and then pass it on to them. I wrote to youlibtech_551_footnoteyesterday regarding Lakshmi and also sent a message for the occasion. Most probably Devdas will arrive there on Sunday.
 I am becoming convinced that the source of asthma also is in the stomach. If, therefore, Chimanlal and Jamna cling to  the experiment of milk diet with determination, their asthma is bound to be cured. And they need not also think that they must drink a certain quantity of milk. I think that they will be able to digest only a very small quantity. Milk is drunk for the sake of the proteins, the ghee and the vitamins which it contains. If proteins give strength, they also diminish it if there is the slightest excess of them. Weak people, therefore, can build up strength by drinking milk in a very small quantity. The chief food of such people should be vegetables and juicy fruits. Without trying other remedies, therefore, if they eat bhaji and juicy fruits in plenty and drink a very small quantity of milk for strength, they are bound to get all right. And if this regimen does not help them, I will not mind their concluding that nothing else will and doing nothing. They should drink the milk unboiled and mixed with some fruit or green vegetable. In doing so, they would be eating milk instead of drinking it, and it will then be much easier to digest. They should also regularly do pranayamas, slowly and moderately, on an empty stomach. Besides, they should take sun-bath. In this season, hip-bath also is bound to be beneficial.
 I have looked into Radha’s accounts. I am returning them. I think in the present circumstances we are helpless in this matter.
 
 Expenses on food alone come to Rs. 30. Rs. 55 account for rent, railway fare and other expenses during the journey, and Rs. 25 for the doctor’s fees, maid servant, postage, repair of watch, etc., and playing cards for bezique. There may be room for criticism in regard to this item of Rs. 25, but there can be no criticism in regard to the Rs. 30 for food, if the amount is for one month. The whole question of Ashram expenses, that is, of our way of living, is a complicated one. If we carefully watch ourselves daily and introduce greater and greater simplicity in the Ashram, we shall learn to rely more and more on God in our misfortunes in the shape of illness and accidents. Our work then will shine better. We shall feel happy with ourselves and will be safe in all circumstances. It will then be easy for us to control, without criticizing them, those others who spend too much. “We” here means most of the inmates of the Ashram who are seekers after truth and have dedicated themselves to its pursuit. Personally I feel that a time is coming when we shall have to live  like  sannyasis confined to the Ashram. That is, we shall have to be content with whatever treatment we can get in the Ashram itself for any illness. Almora was intended, is still intended, to supplement the Ashram. But I think it would be desirable to renounce even that. But we can do all these things only by cultivating such a climate of opinion in the Ashram. In doing so, nobody should look to what the other inmates do. Anybody who feels that he ought to practise such sannyasa should start doing so. In other words, he will not go anywhere outside the Ashram for treatment of illness or for his personal work. Just now, this is only an aspiration. I have merely taken this opportunity to put the suggestion before you so that you may think over it at leisure and discuss it with other senior inmates.
 Sitla Sahai has attacked me too. But I have thrown the responsi- bility for the whole thing on you. He also has complained that I have shifted the responsibility. I will put up with that charge. Ask Purushot- tam to write a detailed letter to me. The doctor’s remarks in regard to Kanu seem justified to me. If he has carefully learnt how to do the massage, if he gives complete rest to the affected part and if it is gently massaged every day, it will certainly be cured. The improve- ment will of course take time.
 Parashuram seems to have joined the Ashram to test your capacity for endurance. But you are strong enough and so we need not worry. You may give him divorce when you can bear it no longer. Personally, I am now ready to accept this reform in Hindu marriage. Millions of poor Hindus do have the custom of divorce. Their lives would become unbearable without it. I see no dharma in people regarding themselves as belonging to the twice-born class and forcing women to accept their ideal. Spiritual bonds must be indissoluble. But when the ideal is forced upon people through law, it ceases to be dharma. I was discussing the question of marriage with the Ashram, but I digressed and discussed the problem of  ordinary  marriage. Those who join the Ashram marry it, and say so. The Ashram is the wife and the person who joins it is the husband. When, however, the bond becomes unbearable to the poor wife, she has every right to ask for divorce. You may use this right whenever you wish to.
 Blessings from
 BAPU

 APPENDICES
 APPENDIX 1
 TALK WITH SADASHIVRAO AND SHINDElibtech_552_footnote
 January 13, 1933
 BAPU: Even after this Bill is passed the majority should not exercise their right to frighten away the minority. The temple should be kept open for a few hours daily for the sake of the minority. They too have a certain sentiment for the image and believe in its importance and power. I would say to them that they should have darshan to their heart’s content before the temple becomes ‘impure’; I would go in after that.
 SADASHIVRAO: But would it not hurt their inferiority complex?
 BAPU: The question of inferiority arises only in the case of Harijans. If the reformists are in a majority, the Harijans should act like seniors, and should do out of their free will what they are not bound to do by law.
 I don’t want separate temples erected. But I would say to them [the sanatanists]: ‘I shall make the necessary arrangement for you. You should not go away. I do not want to pay you in the same coin. You had regarded us as low. You asked up to be content with having darshan of the tower. But we are not going to regard you as low. We shall let you precede us and we shall respect your sentiments regarding the purity of the image.’ Man compromises either through weakness or because he is strong. As a votary of truth I would make a compromise on the basis of my strength. Only yesterday I dealt with the sanatanists in this way. They asked me to sign some document. Normally I would not endorse such a statement. But in order to satisfy them I affixed my signature, but after making a couple of most essential changes. If I disclose what took place between them and me, it is not going to shed lustre on Hinduism.
 I have learnt a lot from my involvement in this issue. I came to know what the Shastras had to say. Without knowing all this I could  not  have  issued  such statements. I would not have at any rate been able to write with such authority. Even the thought of this compromise would not have occurred to me had I not had all these interviews with them.
 SHINDE: But they think this is where the hitch comes in.
 BAPU: I do not look upon it as any hitch. I do not believe that all those who
 
 raise objections are insincere. I don’t want to drive them out of the temples. The lives of those who go to temples with a sincere heart are linked with the temples. I say this on the strength of my mother’s example. She would not put a grain in her mouth without having darshan in a temple, however ill and bed-ridden she might be. She used to derive strength from this practice of hers. I do not want to exercise the right I have acquired as though I were a demon or a bully. I have to give a thought to a true mother. All the women who visit temples are but mothers to me. If they want to preserve the purity [of the images], they may do so. The Harijans should be charitable enough to let them do it. In fact they should let them do it of their own free will. Take the instance of spectacles and injections which are in vogue. Our ancestors would regard these as superstitions. Tomorrow there may come up somebody who may regard praying as so much superstition. Even then we ought to respect people’s sentiments. Therefore the compromise I have suggested is absolutely correct. The sanatanists would not admit it but I do see they are coming closer to me. I am myself a Harijan and I have influence over them.
 SHINDE: The Harijans will of course listen to you. They are bound to listen to you. When I ask you not to make any compromise, I do not mean that there will never be any compromise.
 BAPU: Mate wanted a segregated space for having darshan. That was an unfair compromise.
 SHINDE: From the spiritual point of view your compromise is no compromise at all. It will gradually wear out.
 BAPU: Yes, it takes for granted mutual respect and sincerity. Only then does a temple become a true temple. In the same way the sanatanists can, if they want to, have tables reserved in restaurants. While I suggest all this I take it for granted that we are in the majority. If the sanatanists are in the majority we may not set foot in the temples.
 I have found out a new way of looking at compromises. The initiative for compromise should come from the stronger party. Only he who has truth on his side can arrive at such a compromise.
 SHINDE: Yes, the same is true of forgiveness, which only the strong can practise.
 BAPU: This compromise in no way detracts from your principles, or mine or anybody else’s. One that would do violence to other’s principles can only be called cruel.

  APPENDIX II  DISCUSSION WITH 	A FRIENDlibtech_553_footnote      What 		is meant by the Inner Voice?          January 	13, 1933 
  A . 	The Inner Voice is the voice of the Lord. It is a voice other than 	our own. It could be the voice of Satan or of God. In order to 	ensure that it is God that speaks from within us, we should 	correctly observe the yamas 	and niyamas. 	Millions of men may 	claim to hear the Inner Voice but the true Inner Voice could be 	heard in very few. We cannot adduce proof in its support. But it 	does have its influence. The Inner Voice is a power beyond us but it 	is not an outer force. ‘Beyond us’ means ‘a power which is 	beyond our ego’. When the ego is lying dormant there are two 	forces which act upon  it, 	the real and the unreal. When we are one with the power that is real 	it is said, in the language of mysticism, that God is speaking 	through us. When we are one with sat 	our ego is reduced to 	zero.  Q. 	When can man claim to have heard the Inner Voice?  BAPU: 	That depends 	upon the man. When he 	experiences that 	he is not 	acting on 	his own he 	can make that claim. 	Supposing I 	constantly try 	to hear 	the Inner Voice, 	I constantly 	pray to 	God that 	He should 	act through 	me and 	reduce me 	to a cipher, 	a moment 	will come when I shall 	feel that the Lord 	is letting 	me hear 	Him. At such 	a time I can even say that I am hearing the voice of the Lord. But 	how can I prove it? It 	is for my 	conduct to 	prove it. 	But that too 	will not 	be the 	final test. Supposing a 	man lies buried 	in a 	cave in 	the Himalayas 	and God sends 	me there 	to see 	him. Supposing 	I reach 	the place, 	I dig 	a little 	and meet 	the man. 	Even then quite likely it 	may not be 	that I 	heard the 	Inner Voice. It 	could be 	a mere 	accident or 	even my 	illusion or 	someone might have said 	it to me. 	The world will no 	doubt judge me 	from the result. If the result is favourable the world will say that 	it was a miracle. But indeed 	there can 	be no final 	proof in this 	case. Man 	himself does 	not know 	when he is 	deceiving himself, or 	when he 	is pretending. There 	is a 	greater danger in 	hypocrisy than 	in self-deception.  We 	find further proof when there are many instances pointing towards 	the same conclusion. This includes all the great men, Buddha, 	Krishna, Mohammed. It was not with their own power that they uttered 	the truths. But some occult power urged them to such utterance. Some 	people are worthyenough, and through them the occult power works. 	But we cannot be sure when it will happen.  [From Gujarati]  Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, Vol. III, pp. 	49-50      
  
 APPENDIX III
 DISCUSSION WITH DHARMADEVlibtech_554_footnote
 January 17, 1933
 BAPU: I accept heredity to the extent that the progeny of a pure Brahmin man and a pure Brahmin woman should be a Brahmin. If such a Brahmin raises his children  as Shudras he should be regarded as fallen from his varna. He becomes a fallen Brahmin.
 DHARMADEV: But why at all call him a Brahmin?
 BAPU: There is no high and low among the varnas. We may call him only fallen because he can return to his varna by quitting his fallen state. Leave aside the talk of high and low. Suppose a carpenter gives up carpentry and takes up the work of cleaning lavatories. The Gita would describe him as fallen from dharma. “Better is death in the discharge of one’s duty.” A carpenter may not go after the work of a goldsmith. Similarly, if he tries to get instructed in the Vedas, even then I would call him a carpenter who had fallen. We want to bring about harmony between dharma and karma (i.e., practical life). Will it do if we talked of making people adventurous and asked them all to embark upon trade? Hence occupations came to be hereditary. We may only ask them to apply their talents and powers for society’s enduring welfare. Today we admire those who assault the Kanchanjungha. My heart does not admire them; it censures them. It is not that we never made any discoveries. Patanjali is responsible for the scientific discovery of ahimsa.
 DHARMADEV: Does it mean that one may not develop in oneself any quality appropriate to [any other] varna? I am a Kshatriya but I have no Kshatriya quality. You are a Vaishya, but where is your Vaishya conduct?
 BAPU: I was talking of a pure social order. No such order exists today. There is today a confusion of varnas because the ashrama system has disappeared. Only one ashrama remains now—the householder’s. And that too not based on dharma but on self-indulgence. And the varna that remains is the Shudra’s. Today we are slaves under an alien rule because there are no more Kshatriyas, no more Brahmins, no more Vaishyas. The Vaishyas are busy making money. And can we describe ourselves even as Shudras? We serve only under compulsion, not regarding service as our dharma. A Shastri admitted to me that we are all Chandalas by our actions. What should this Chandala community do? Should it attempt to bring about varnadharma? I don’t say that this varnadharma should have the same name. The Shastras have described
 
 dharma as without beginning but they do speak of organization into varnas. I am yet doing my sadhana. I cannot speak in this matter with any self-confidence because my sadhana is not adequate.
 DHARMADEV: Then why don’t you say that you don’t believe in any varna, as there is no varna today? You have maintained that a Brahmin is born,  but  Brahminhood is not acquired by birth. “A man is born a Shudra.”libtech_555_footnote
 BAPU: I don’t agree with you on this point. The Arya Samajists have restricted their reason. My language is aphoristic, it lacks precision. It is therefore open to several interpretations.
 DHARMADEV: You say that Brahmins should regain the high position they held of yore.
 BAPU: Quite correct. I was born a Vaishya, but people see in me certain qualities worthy of a Brahmin and say that I am a Brahmin. But I must earn my livelihood through my qualities as a Shudra. At the Ashram everyone works eight hours a day to earn his food. This communism of mine is deduced from Hinduism. Ruskin also taught the same thing. But today the Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra all want to become multi-millionaires. Hence I maintained that everyone should have equal payment, whether a barrister or a Shudra. Everyone should dedicate his talent to the service of the community. If the whole community made sacrifices the people would not starve. Even gamblers have everything in common. We are worse than the gamblers. I have come across such generous gamblers on board who pocket nothing as their personal gains but spend it off in the company. My heart weeps at our present condition. Tears may not fall from my eyes but my heart does weep. I cry when anyone commits an untruth or succumbs to passion at the Ashram which runs on public funds. I wish that the experiment which I am carrying on at the Ashram is tried in the whole world. If I fail in this I would not mind taking a thousand births to fulfil it. Whoever employs his talent for personal gain is good for nothing. One’s talent ought to be utilized for one’s own community. I must express my thoughts in a new language.
 DHARMADEV: But you also say that you accept both varna and karma [one’s actions as deciding one’s caste].
 BAPU: Look, here is a matter of justice. What can we do if people do not lend us their ear however much we may carry on our propaganda? That is why man has been advised to observe silence. What else can be propagated except truth? I have declared what varnadharma is, but now I don’t propagate it because it is irrelevant. There is no feeling of high and low in varnadharma, but it is very much there in untouchability.
 
 Therefore untouchability is an excrescence on varnadharma.
 DHARMADEV: It was born of caste.
 BAPU: Yes, from caste; but with the disappearance of untouchability the feeling of high and low among the castes will also go. The greatest reptile is the serpent of untouchability. I don’t care if the rest, such as the scorpion and so on persist. When untouchability goes . . . .
 DHARMADEV: But it will not go unless we break the barriers of caste.
 BAPU: Why did I undertake this fast? only to do away with that feeling of high and low.
 DHARMADEV Why don’t you say it plainly? You mix up the issues of heredity and actions.
 BAPU: But I do proclaim myself an enemy of caste; I am a champion of the varnas.
 DHARMADEV: But you do mix up [the issues of] heredity and actions. Why should we regard Harijans as Shudras? But you have said as much.
 BAPU: Now I would not repeat that statement. Now I would only say that we may not regard him as Chandala.
 DHARMADEV: Why don’t you clarify the sanatana dharma? Sanatana dharma is the eternal dharma.
 BAPU: Sanatana dharma might contain the eternal dharma, but if the people would not accept this position how will it remain eternal? I subscribe to the Jain theory of anekantavada. I do not accept any one thing as admitting  only  one solution. Hence I call this dharma the true dharma. But I would not call it sanatana— as long as the world does not accept it.
 DHARMADEV: Where did you find this interpretation?
 BAPU: This is the historical interpretation. The historical interpretation of
 goghnalibtech_556_footnoteis different from its actual meaning.
 DHARMADEV: No. You are not clarifying your position to the sanatanists. You ought to tell them that sanatana dharma means the eternal dharma, the Vedic dharma; all that is opposed to it is adharma. “There is no dharma higher than the Veda.” You have said in one place that the Shastras should be acceptable both to the reason and to the heart. Nothing in the Vedas is contrary to reason.
 BAPU: Say, there are two Shastris quarrelling over the interpretation of the word duhitri. One says that it means a daughter, the other says it means one who milks the cows. Both of them went far in the dispute and the judge ordered both of them to be sent to the gallows because one talks of one thing and the other talks of
 
 the same thing in a different sense. Similarly we cannot carry on a discussion by each of us offering a different interpretation of sanatana dharma. Therefore I say that you are making nonsense of sanatana dharma. They say there is a sanatana dharma to marry off a ten-year-old girl. Now if the people would not support such a thing, who would call it sanatana dharma? They say they have millions ofmen behind them, I say there are millions of men behind me. I emphatically say that I talk of nothing but the ancient dharma which I interpret as above. Someone said that I should declare myself an Arya Samajist. I said, “Why? Is it because people might stop agreeing with me?” Should I give up the Smritis, Itihasas, Puranas? I have a different interpretation of image-worship in which I believe. I even maintain that there is image-worship in Christianity and even Islam. According to my dharma I should preserve all that is worth preserving and reject all else. Hence I say that I don’t want a new name. The name Hindu dharma is enough for me. For me Hindu dharma is an unfathomable ocean. It includes many things. Therefore I call myself neither an Arya Samajist nor a Brahmo Samajist but only a Hindu.
 DHARMADEV: In what sense do you believe in image-worship? Acharya Ramadev maintains that since the temple is a public place it should be open to all. However, we should try and persuade the priests to give up image-worship.
 BAPU: Here I differ with you. I believe that those who have the darshan of the Lord in Kashi Vishwanath [really] see Him. My mother never took a meal without having darshan of the Lord in the temple. She used to tell me that she went there to
 become pure, to fulfil her dharma. I bow to her. I wondered what dharma I could teach this mother. All these things are imaginary and are sustained only by faith.
 DHARMADEV: But would one agree to see bread in stone?
 BAPU: Yes, if a man looked upon stone as bread and ate it he will no doubt have peace at the moment. Vishwamitra took the flesh after stealing it. He bathed and performed sandhya, and then threw it away. But did he not have peace when in the first instance he took it? I am a votary of truth, I am in quest of God, I find new gems daily which I go on distributing to others. The same thing is to be found in my recent statement about civil disobedience and untouchability. It may look incomprehensible because the science of satyagraha is new, people are not used to it.
 DHRMADEV: Some say that you are promulgating a new Veda with the help of your Inner Voice.
 BAPU: Let them say so! I believe there can be no new Veda. The Vedas are endless. Anybody’s utterance at the inspiration of the Lord within is nothing but Veda. What Mohammed has said could also be Vedic utterance. That is precisely why truth is Veda.
 DHARMADEV: Veda is truth.
 BAPU: All right, but Vedas mean pure knowledge and pure knowledge cannot be opposed to truth. If you come across a statement opposed to morality or truth you should say that it is an interpolation. Or if it is a Vedic statement you do not accept it.
 DHARMADEV: Do you still find Satyarthaprakash a disappointing work?
 BAPU: I have not yet said that I don’t. What should I do?
 DHARMADEV: At the time when you said it you wanted to bring about Hindu-Muslim unity by any means. That is why you said so.
 BAPU: That means I told a lie?
 DHARMADEV: No. But the atmosphere had influenced you. I request you to please read the book again. I have read it many times and every time I read it I find something new in it.
 BAPU: This I can accept. But at present where can I find the time to read? But I shall see.

 INTERVIEW TO “THE HINDU” CORRESPONDENTlibtech_557_footnote
 POONA,
 January 14, 1933
 “Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof” cryptically remarked Mahatma Gandhi when your correspondent met him this afternoon in the shade of a mango tree in the jail compound and asked him what would be his attitude if the Government decided on some dilatory course of action to gain time and refused immediate sanction   to Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill.
 The Mahatma’s general health, I was told, is fairly good. I learn that no specialist has yet been called in to examine his right elbow. He was signing  numerous replies to letters, which Mr. Mahadeo Desai had prepared earlier in consultation with him. At one corner was sitting Gandhiji’s Madrasi typist.
 Gandhiji said that he would await the Government of India’s decision. He stated that he had decided to express his views on the much discussed proposition to send round a committee to gauge opinion in respect of temple-entry.
 Gandhiji wanted the lawyers to examine the legal issue and pronounce their
 
 opinions irrespective of the Government’s decision on the question  of  giving sanction to the Bill. If the Government decided against giving sanction to the Bill, he was sure matters would not be allowed to rest there. He would try to unsettle a settled question, in the same manner as he had done in the case of the Premier’s Award. He would enter into correspondence with the highest authority and would resist with his life, if necessary, what he considered to be a piece of injustice to a section of humanity.

 APPENDIX V
 STATEMENT BY MADAN MOHAN MALAVIYAlibtech_558_footnote
 The object of the special session of the Sanatana Dharma Mahasabha is to focus and voice the most informed and most esteemable orthodox opinion on some questions, including those relating to the removal of untouchability and temple-entry which has been agitating the sanatanist world on one side, and those who are described as reformers on the other. I have been distressed to note differences between the two sides becoming acute, and it is evident that if these differences are unsolved, the Hindu community would be further divided and weakened. The differences are largely due to misunderstanding, and this, in its turn, is due to a great extent on imperfect knowledge of what the Shastras have laid down for  our  guidance  in important matters in question. It should not be necessary to say that Mahatma Gandhi cannot desire to injure sanatana dharma. He has proved to the world that he is willing and determined to throw away even his life in the attempt to serve the country by removing disabilities under which the vast number of those who belong to it labour, so that they may enjoy the full benefit of being Hindus and remain contented and happy members of the community.
 It is equally necessary to say that sanatanists who do not agree with Mahatma Gandhi’s proposals or methods are not wanting in sympathy with the depressed classes. This being so, I am confident that it is possible to arrive at a solution of the problem in conformity with the Shastras which should be acceptable to both sections of sanatanist opinion—more advanced and less advanced—and  which  should establish peace and religious unity among the Hindu community on a basis that will endure.
 From statements recently made by Mahatma Gandhi, it is clear that he is not only willing, but anxious to show every respect for the orthodox opinion.
 
 From utterances of several esteemed exponents of sanatana dharma, it is also clear that they are willing to move forward to bring about an understanding which will  be consistent with the Shastras. This being so, I believe that, by dispassionate consideration of the Shastras by those who claim to expound them, it will be generally conceded, rules of action can be laid down which would secure the most liberal and practicable advance for the humblest Hindu and satisfaction to the most orthodox conservative opinion which is willing to act in conformity not merely with the letter, but also with the spirit of the Shastras. I have convened the Mahasabha with the conviction that such a unity can be brought about among the sanatanist Hindus and appeal to all of them to make such contribution to the success of this effort as lies in their power.
 To prevent misunderstanding, I wish to make the position clear. Speaking in 1923 as the President of the Hindu Mahasabha of Holy Kashi in the presence of great gathering of learned and pious men, I pleaded that opportunity should be afforded even to the humblest Hindu to have a purifying and ennobling darshan of the deity whom we adore in our temples and offer his prayer to Him. I urged that this may be done in conformity with rules which may be laid down in that behalf and further urged that other disabilities from which the depressed classes suffered should be removed. I still hold the same opinion and have publicly repeated it many times during the last few years and last few months, but have never been able to approve of recourse to satyagraha with the object of getting the temple opened to the depressed classes. I do not think it right that this kind of pressure should be exerted in a matter where religious convictions and practices come into play. Those who  adhere  to  the orthodox view have also got their convictions which are deep-seated and come down through the ages. I believe that it is the sacred duty of those of us who differ from them to do our best to bring about a change of those convictions. But by the very nature of the case, this duty demands that we should attempt it by resort to peaceful persuasion only.
 This was laid down in a resolution which was passed by the Bombay public meeting held immediately after the Poona Pact over which I presided, and at which, the All-India Anti-untouchability League was established for the purpose of carrying on propaganda against untouchability. That resolution stated that “for this purpose steps should immediately be taken to secure as early as possible that (a) all public wells, schools, roads, sarais, dharmashalas, crematoriums, burning-ghats,  etc.,  should be declared open to the depressed classes and (b) all public temples should be open to members of the depressed classes provided that for carrying out (a) and (b) no force or compulsion be used but resort shall be had only to peaceful persuasion.” It is both just and expedient that the solution of such a question should be one that would satisfy the community as a whole. In my opinion, such a solution can be reached only
 by the method of argument and persuasion with the help of those scholars who are versed in the Shastras and who desire the good of every section of the community. It  is to bring about such an agreement and solution that I have invited the special session of the Sanatana Dharma Mahasabha, and I am hoping and praying too that God will bless the attempt and crown it with success.
 Towards this end, I intend to place the following concrete proposal before the Mahasabha, that for the uplift of the depressed classes, the following plan may be adopted:-
  (a) 	Samskar and 	updesh—initiation 	and instruction—known 	as diksha. 	This will 	consist (a) of 	prayashchittam—penance 	and purification; 
 tyag—giving up carrion and beef, leavings of dishes (uchchhishta), wine;  diksha—receiving 	mantram, either 	ashtakshar mantram 	(with or 	without wearing 	tulsi bead); 	panchakshar mantram 	(with or without 	wearing rudraksha bead);  Achara 	grahana—daily bath 	and daily 	prayer (morning and 	evening), daily 	reading of 	the sacred 	book (teaching 	every man, woman 	and child 	to read 	and write will 	be an integral 	part of the scheme);  vrata—vows—observing 	five necessary 	vows which 	are prescribed 	for all 	castes, ahimsa, satya, 	asteya, shaucham and 	indriyanigraha, 	(hurtlessness, truth, 	non-stealing, purity of 	body and 	mind, and 	control of senses); 
 (a) 	freedom to 	join public meetings and 	public schools; 
  use 	of public 	wells, roads, parks, sarais, dharmashalas, 	burning-ghats, etc.; and entry 	into public temples for 	devadarshana and stuti. 
 NOTES. If the scheme is approved, the giving of diksha should be completed within a month. The carrying out of this scheme will mean a great social, religious and spiritual uplift of the classes. It will mean making them Harijans in the full sense of the term. This will be only one of the proposals to be placed before the gathering of Acharyas and learned men. There will be many proposals before them for their consideration. There is every hope that with God’s grace result of deliberations will be one which will be welcomed with joy by all followers of sanatana dharma and all well-wishers of humanity.

 TALK WITH M. G. BHANDARIlibtech_559_footnote
 January 24, 1933
 The Superintendent read the statement. When Gandhiji woke up he said, “What do you propose to do now? Let me know so that I may inform the Government. . . .
 But it would be better if you do not go on a fast now.”
 BAPU: There is no Inner Voice urging me to go on a fast forthwith. It would be regarded as an arbitrary action if I went on a fast now. I am perturbed at the Viceroy’s decision, no doubt, but it is likely that my perturbation might be only temporary. A fast might be in the offing but not now. If it comes up in its natural course let it. I cannot say when it will come. I shall have to go on a fast only if I feel helpless—as I had been at the time of the Award when I resorted to a fast. You can inform the Government that it is not my intention to go on a fast in the immediate future. You have already seen my statement. I have nothing in my heart over and above this statement. Today I woke at 3 in the morning, and my mind was absolutely clear about what I had to write. The beautiful Chitra star was shining above.

 APPENDIX VII
 TALK WITH DUNCAN GREENLEESlibtech_560_footnote
 January 25, 1933
 BAPU: Whatever the non-Hindus might do is not likely to touch the core of this injustice because the Harijans are still clinging to Hinduism. I know how much they are inter-twined with Hinduism. That is why I had poured out my heart in my speech at the Round Table Conference. In India the villages are mostly populated by Hindus. All the untouchables say that they are Hindus. Quite a few do not even feel the injustice. They are in such a miserable plight that the thought of renouncing their faith would not occur to them. But I shall not be surprised if some day they set out to kill the Savarnas.
 G. Would they be suffering from inferiority complex?
 
 BAPU: No, worse. In the case of inferiority complex there is the consciousness of injustice being done. But these people are not even aware of it. That is why I say that if a non-Hindu happens to be interested in this movement he should be prompted only by compassion. If a non-Hindu wants to help, he should associate himself with a Hindu organization before doing so.
 G. I have been to the temples of South India.
 BAPU: I want to stop this parody of Hinduism. I want pure gold. There will be political consequences of this activity, but I don’t at all think of political consequences. I would engage myself in this activity even if there were to be no political consequences, I don’t care for them. I want to bring about spiritual results and for that I am willing to sacrifice thousands of lives including mine. This is a great injustice being done to a large section of the community. To remove it we ought to work with a sense of atonement. One should work with the feeling that one has committed an injustice and one must remove it oneself. I don’t want a Gengiz Khan to descend upon us and threaten to cut the throats of the obstinate Savarnas and bring about this reform.

 APPENDIX VIII
 DISCUSSION WITH C. RAJAGOPALACHARI AND OTHERSlibtech_561_footnote
 January 30, 1933
 Today Rajaji, Devdas and Ghanshyamdas arrived and discussed the situation arising from the Viceregal sanction to Ranga Iyer’s Bill. Bapu explained that the whole question was religious and had nothing to do with politics.
 My position is wholly religious. I cannot look at this thing from a political viewpoint. I must have the Bill withdrawn if people are really opposed to it. Then someone will tell me with the promptness of an arrow what I should do. We certainly do not wish to enter temples stealthily. Temple-entry is definitely a spiritual act and it must bring about a revolution in society. This whole idea of my fast is based on the belief that a large section of the people favour temple-entry, but they do not voice it.  If people are on our side but the law is not, we can ask the trustees to break the law and  to put up with it if someone were to bring an action against them under this law.
 Bapu then stated that they should obtain a clear referendum in this regard. . . .
 But Bapu thought that even if   it   were  to   take   three   months  the   work   must be
 
 accomplished in the area chosen.
 BIRLA : In that case the best referendum is that there should be fresh elections to the Legislature on this issue.
 BAPU: We would easily win them. But that will not give us the ratio of the temple-going Hindus’ vote.
 . . . Acharya invites us to go to the Varnashrama Swarajya Sangh. He is involved in it. And if we want to do so, we can, by capturing the Sangh and defeating him as it happened in 1921 when the Hindu Mahasabha was captured. But whatever it is, it is intolerable that the Bill should hang fire for two years simply because it was being circulated among the members.
 RAJAJI: Why should we object to it if the delay was due to the circulation of the Bill among the members?
 BAPU: Because we know it is only an excuse and it is dishonest. If as a result  of the referendum public opinion suddenly sways in favour of the Bill I would press for its early passage. . . .
 Then they discussed the subject of Harijan Sevak. Rajaji’s objections were: (1) our journal will be read only by our own people whereas at present your statements are published in all the newspapers. (2) The journal might prove useless.
 BAPU: It is very necessary for training our workers and also for tying up all loose ends. There are so many things which cannot be conveyed through A.P.I. In fact I wonder why you did not feel the necessity of a journal till now.
 For conducting the referendum Birla suggested having pandits instead of laymen but added few men of character could be found among them.
 BAPU: Then they are not needed. Character means clinging steadfast to one’s beliefs. The beliefs of a man who changes them for a higher fee have no worth. I would of course choose to have a sincere pandit, but I would prefer a layman to a pandit who lacks character.
 B
 January 31, 1933
 Vallabhbhai had a heated discussion continuing from the previous evening about a referendum and about utilizing Rajaji in upper India for this purpose.	[He
 argued] that a referendum as such could be of no use unless we have our further aims clarified.
 BAPU: My doubt increases whether the people are firmly behind us.
 VALLABHBHAI: We never had the opportunity to show it. . . .
 Yesterday Bapu had said to Rajaji that he would be able to advise him in this matter to a certain limit only.
 RAJAJI: Since you have started this movement we must work for it.	But if
 the movement would work only if I were out of it I would prefer to quit.
 BAPU: If you independently and dispassionately feel that you alone would be my representative in this movement you should regard this as a clear call to work for the movement and ought to continue the work without caring for public criticism. But   I always recite the verse: “Whoever, leaving secure things etc.”libtech_562_footnoteto those who have the slightest doubt in their minds and tell them that they ought to give the benefit of the doubt to their initial pledge of civil disobedience. But if you feel you have a clear call, and it seems you do, you must do Harijan work.
 RAJAJI: Is the fast yet impending?
 BAPU: Yes, it is unavoidable. Looking at the happenings around I think the sooner it comes the better. I have heard about a case at Kanpur. Three Harijan candidates contested the Municipal Corporation election. The other party sponsored none but three Harijan candidates to oppose them. With the result that no Harijan was elected. This has deeply hurt me. I had girded up my loins against having reserved constituencies. But now I think that had I been in Ambedkar’s place I would have opposed it much more violently. In this Kanpur case they prevented the Harijans from winning only to safeguard their own interest. The people should have only seen to it that three Harijan candidates win the election either for their own party or for the opposition. This case is a clear violation of the Poona Pact. I wrote to Hariji (Pandit Hriday Nath Kunzru).
 He attempted to explain it with cool unconcern and informed me that he would further investigate it. But I want no such investigation. I have already told him to set right this injustice.
 Birla and the others told Bapu that the Kanpur case was only an exception. The Hindu society was undergoing a speedy change for the better.
 BAPU: I do know it. Such instances should not precipitate the fast. But such incidents do upset me. I am however consciously striving to postpone the ordeal of fast.
 BIRLA : But once these Bills are passed wouldn’t there be an end to this question of the fast?
 BAPU: No, my friend, not at all. The fast does not depend solely on the Bills. The question before me is not merely that of temple-entry but the whole question [of untouchability]. Day after day I feel more and more that the likelihood of my fast is not diminishing but growing. I cannot say why it is so. I do not even know what will
 
 precipitate it but this feeling is slowly but certainly growing. I know this much that I am not at all at ease. All these incidents taken as a whole fail to make a good impression on me. True, some good things are also happening. I cannot shut my eyes to them. On the contrary, I try to close my eyes to unfavourable things. For instance look at this nasty correspondence I am carrying on with these religious teachers and legal pandits.
 BIRLA : But you should be content with the speed at which the reform is proceeding.
 BAPU: Yes, those who have patience will be content. But it does not at all comfort my heart. I know our workers have plunged into activity, there is no lethargy in them. But looking at the whole thing there is hardly anything that can satisfy my heart.
 RAJAJI: . . . To cut a long story short I may say that you have grown impatient.
 BAPU: I know, as a practical man I must hold my patience. There is no reason to be impatient. Let me assure you that I entertain no such feeling. I had taken no time to come to the decision before January 2 that I should not go on fast. And let me inform you that some of my co-workers are sore because I didn’t begin my fast on January 2. Only a few days ago a friend argued that no reasons had come up to postpone the fast which had already been decided upon.
 RAJAJI: You have pampered all these co-workers. (Loud laughter)
 BAPU: That is all right. But there are others too who have condemned this postponement and they are not at all known to me. One gentleman even went on an eleven-day fast protesting against me. I sent him a severe wire telling him that his fast was a sin and nothing less; only then did he give it up. Hence as far as this question goes please believe me that I am struggling within myself. Yet I cannot say to you that there will be no fast. When I say this my friends in England do not get angry with me. Whenever they have a doubt in their mind they try to believe that there must be God’s hand behind. Andrews had written to me several times expressing his doubts. Afterwards he wired to me cancelling all his letters and assured me that he had then understood the whole thing correctly.
 Alluding to people’s superstitions, Rajaji said: Some people really believe that hitherto Gandhiji used to bring the rains but now he is committing an act owing to which the rains may fail.
 BAPU: You are talking about the ignorant people. But I have heaps of letters from people with B.A. and B.L. degrees, which are full of anger, bitterness, venom and abuses, besides superstition.
 RAJAJI: This looks like a misalliance between legal expertise and a low class master. (Laughter)
  
 away.
 BAPU: My  present feeling is  that the possibility of  the fast is  not very far
 
 How can I say when the fast will come up? When I started my fast in Bombay
  in 	1921, I abruptly woke up Mathuradas who was sleeping by my side and 	told him: ‘Don’t argue with me, this is my resolution., The same 	was the case with my 21-day fast—Hakimji, Mohammed Ali all were 	dazed. But will anyone on that account say that the fast was wrong? 	I for one think that the fast did achieve its object then, it will 	prove useful even after 5000 years.  Mathuradas 	then asked what a worker should do who felt bound to offer civil 	disobedience but was tired.  BAPU: 	  It   is   difficult   	to    tell.    But 	   why    shouldn’t    	such    a    person 	do Harijan  work?  Of  	course  there  will  be  one  condition, 	 that  he 	 must  declare  that he 	is tired and 	that therefore instead 	of going 	to jail 	he wants 	to do Harijan 	work. He 	cannot do 	Harijan work by concealing 	 this  fact.  Rather 	 than doing  Harijan 	 work  while  concealing  	the  truth  he  had  	better  sit 	 at  home   doing 	nothing. There is 	courage in 	 humbly  confessing 	 the  truth. 	 Those  who  want  to 	rest should declare it 	and say that they want to 	improve their health and 	till then they 	will do 	Harijan work. 	The point 	is that 	one should 	not practise 	deceit. Deceit will 	benefit neither Congress 	work, nor the work 	of civil 	disobedience nor 	untouchability work.  [From Gujarati]  Mahadevbhaini 	Diary, Vol. III, pp. 	100-6    APPENDIX 1X  LETTER FROM 	GOVERNMENT OF INDIAlibtech_563_footnote  [Before 	February 17, 1933] 	The  Governor-General-in-Council 	has  carefully 	considered the points urged by  Mr. 	Gandhi in his letter of the 1st February 1933, addressed to the 	Private Secretary to the Viceroy, 	in which 	he requests 	that, for the reasons 	stated therein, the 	Government of India should 	facilitate the 	progress and 	passage of 	the Bills regarding temple-entry, 	which will be 	introduced in 	the Assembly 	by Mr. 	Ranga Iyer and others. He 	is unable to 	accept the 	arguments developed by 	Mr. Gandhi 	relating to the 	Poona Pact, and 	notes that the 	Resolution he 	has quoted 	did not form 	part of the 	Pact as communicated to the Government of India. In the matter of the Pact, Government    
 were concerned merely to accept a modification of the representation in the Legislatures which had been provided in the Communal Award by His Majesty’s Government. But quite apart from the Pact, the Government for many years have taken an active interest in the improvement of the conditions under which the depressed classes live. That interest has been directed to the matters referred to in the Resolution which he quotes, such as education and the provision of the normal facilities of life, which were placed in the forefront of the Resolution but appear not to be regarded by him as the vital part of it. The Government have naturally taken no initiative in matters which specifically affect religious practice. In regard to that, they have nothing to add to the statement issued to the Press on 23rd January. They must reiterate that in their opinion it is essential that the consideration of a measure, which so closely affects the religious customs and usages of the Hindu community, should not proceed unless the proposals are subjected to the fullest examination in all their aspects, not merely in the Legislatures, but also outside it, by all who will be affected by them. This purpose can only be satisfied if the Bill is circulated in the widest manner for the purpose of eliciting public opinion, and if adequate time is given to enable all classes of Hindus to form and express their considered views.

 APPENDIX X
 DISCUSSION WITH B. R. AMBEDKARlibtech_564_footnote
 February 4, 1933
 Discussing the propriety or otherwise of Ranga Iyer’s two Bills [Ambedkar] said: The one-paragraph Bill is a very simple one. Its fair point lies in admitting that this custom is immoral. There is no such admission in the second Bill.
 BAPU: No, it is there in its preamble.
 A. But it is not clear. . . . I also think that the two Bills do not go together. . .
 BAPU: The one-paragraph Bill is certainly superior to the other. But the other lengthier Bill was brought forward because the first one could not be introduced in the Provincial Legislature. There is no contradiction in the two Bills. In one Bill untouchability ceases to be a disability and the law refuses to accept the argument based on untouchability. As a result of the second Bill, temple authorities are obliged to take steps under certain circumstances. If we can get both the Bills passed the trustees will not be able to put up any kind of obstacle. I take it upon myself to have all the temples opened within one month if we could get both the Bills passed. The
 
 sanatanists would prefer the second Bill. But speaking as a sincere sanatanist I would prefer the first Bill.
 A.	Now the Government will have to issue orders against the sanatanists
 under Section 144 because they would be regarded as interfering with untouchables’ rights.
 BAPU: However, I want you now to emphatically proclaim your ideas in very clear words.
 As far as we are concerned we have no immediate concern other than 
 securing political power	and that alone is the solution of our problem.
 . . . We want our social status raised in the eyes of the savarna Hindus.
 There is another point of view also. The object of this effort could be that you want the depressed classes to be retained in the Hindu religion, in which case I am inclined to believe that it is not sufficient in the present awakened state of the depressed classes. If I call myself a Hindu I am obliged to accept that by birth I
 belong to a low caste. Hence I think I must ask the Hindus to show me some sacred authority which would rule out this feeling of lowliness. If it cannot be I should say goodbye to Hinduism.       I am not going to be satisfied with measures which would
 merely bring some relief.	I don’t want to be crushed by your charity.
 BAPU : I have nothing to say if you have come with a final decision that you are not going to move your little finger to have this Bill passed.
 A . We have not made any decision. However, I have shown you how my mind is working.
 BAPU : I told you that I could have nothing to say if you have already taken a decision.
 A . We cannot ask the savarna Hindus to decide for themselves whether or not we are a part of them. You ought to demonstrate your determination by getting these Bills passed. . . .
 BAPU: I am not asking you to do anything. I never wanted the depressed people to go on their knees to the savarna Hindus and ask them to get these Bills passed. Unfortunately, the solution of this problem is in the hands of a third power which is in a position to mend or worsen the situation.
 A . I can set right the thing.
 BAPU: That is right. Of course I agree with you that it does not behove your dignity to approach the Hindus. I take the position—you might remember since I made the speech at the Round Table Conference—that we should atone for this. If you repudiate us and go away I would think that we only deserved it.
 A . The Bill mentions temple-entry but it makes no mention of entry into the sanctum sanctorum. Will they let a member of the depressed community place flowers
 on the idol, or will they let him offer a tray containing oblations? Malaviyaji has already declared that question of offering puja does not arise.
 BAPU : Temple-entry is meant for puja if anything. But if the language of the Bill is not right it can be amended and we can say ‘entry for the purpose of puja’. It seems there has been some misunderstanding somewhere in the case of Malaviyaji. He would not say what you attribute to him. Flowers, sweets or any other offerings from Harijans will surely be accepted. So we two agree on this point that there is no question of your imploring the savarna Hindus. When some savarna Hindus tell me
 that Harijans do not want to enter the temples I ask them to throw open the temple doors for the Harijans whether or not they wish to come in. They ought to have the satisfaction that they have done their duty. They ought to discharge the debt which they owe whether the creditor keeps it or throws it into the gutter. But I must say that you ought not to say that you are not a Hindu. In accepting the Poona Pact you accept the position that you are Hindus.
 A . I have accepted only the political aspect of it.
 BAPU : You cannot escape the situation that you are Hindus in spite of your statement to the contrary.
 A . We ask of you that our silence should not be misconstrued. After that I accept your point.
 BAPU: I go one step further. You will not be able to go ahead a single step unless you maintain your position absolutely correct. I regard temple-entry as a spiritual matter through which everything else will bear fruit.
 A . The Hindu mind does not work in a rational way. They have no objection to the untouchables touching them on the railway and other public places. Why do they object to it only in the case of temples?
 BAPU: We are well caught on this point. I take up the question of temple-entry first of all because these people want to cling to untouchability in the temples. Many sanatanist Hindus say that they would admit Harijans in schools and public places but not in temples. I ask them to grant the Harijans equal status before God. It will raise their status.
 A . Supposing we are lucky in the case of temple-entry, will they let us fetch water from the wells?
 BAPU: Sure. This is bound to follow it. And it is also very easy.

 A TALKlibtech_565_footnote
 February 13, 1933
 Like Angada and Krishna who had gone with the message of truce, we approach these legislators and the Government. Justice can be demanded from any source and that, too, forcefully. We fail in dharma if we do not demand justice. What does the pledge taken at Bombay imply? [It implies that] as far as possible we will abolish untouchability by law before the attainment of swaraj. We do not want to accomplish anything by force. I do not want to achieve it by undertaking a fast—God will make me undertake one [sooner or later]—for it is likely that I might be deluded into describing it as inspired by God. Kelappan had said to me that the temple would be thrown open within a couple of days. Yet I told him that though it might help throw open the temple immediately how could we continue a fast that was initiated on unjust grounds.
 Now remains the question of the law. I for one want no laws. I am an anarchist. Bat I want to act within the limits of the law. In this case we want a law enacted in order to undo another. At present the decision of the law-courts has become as good as the shruti (Revelation) and the Government is the God who reveals it. Therefore we ask the Government to repeal it. Let us take the first Bill. The Invisible Power will punish breach of a religious commandment, a ruler does not have this authority. The wholly Hindu State might acquire this authority. But in the present case it is the Government which inflicts punishment for breach of a religious injunction. This is gross injustice. We must have it removed and thus follow our dharma. How long can we keep it pending? Whether it is a mixed legislature or even a Muslim Government, we should have it passed by them. Today we cannot follow our dharma. Even where the trustees are willing to throw open the temple the law forbids them from doing so. Now have I any other course open? Hence the Bill. With the passage of this Bill no one believing in untouchability will be compelled to give it up. I am this day prepared to give in writing that unless the sanatanists are willing to throw open the temples they will not be forced to do so.
 By fighting we can get justice even from anti-national Government— rather it becomes our dharma. Malaviyaji is a Yudhishthira. He is always in doubt. In his perpetual anxiety to follow the dictates of dharma, he often fails to follow it at all. Vyasa had such wonderful power. He depicts Yudhishthira as a rather weak person; yet
 
 he is Dharmaraja. In the same sense Malaviyaji also is a Dharmaraja. We can never give him up. He has boundless love for me and whenever he loses in an argument he thinks that there must be some truth in what I say.

 R. 	AMBEDKAR’S STATEMENTlibtech_567_footnote 
 Although the controversy regarding the question of temple-entry is confined to the sanatanists and Mahatma Gandhi, the Depressed Classes have undoubtedly a very important part to play in it, in so far as their position is bound to weigh the scale one way or the other, when the issue comes for a final settlement. It is, therefore, necessary that their viewpoint should be defined and stated so as to leave no ambiguity about it.
 To the Temple-entry Bill of Mr. Ranga Iyer as now drafted, the Depressed Classes cannot possibly give their support. The principle of the Bill is that if a majority of municipal and local board voters in the vicinity of any particular temple on a referendum decide by a majority that the Depressed Classes shall be allowed to enter the temple, the trustees or the manager of the temple shall give effect to that decision. The principle is an ordinary principle of majority rule, and there is nothing
 
 radical or revolutionary about the Bill, and if the sanatanists were a wise lot they would accept it without demur.
 The reasons why the Depressed Classes cannot support a Bill based upon this principle are two. One reason is that the Bill cannot hasten the day of temple-entry for the Depressed Classes any nearer than otherwise would be the case. It is true that under the Bill, the minority will not have the right to obtain an injunction against the trustee, or the manager who throws open the temple to the Depressed Classes in accordance with the decision of the majority. But before one can draw any satisfaction from this clause and congratulate the author of the Bill, one must first of all feel assured that when the question is put to the vote, there will be a majority in favour of templeentry. If one is not suffering from illusions of any kind, one must accept that the hope of a majority voting in favour of temple-entry will be very rarely realized if at all. Without doubt, the majority is definitely opposed today—a fact which is conceded by the author of the Bill himself in his correspondence with the Shankaracharya.
 What is there in the situation as created after the passing of the Bill, which can lead one to hope that the majority will act differently? I find nothing. I shall, no doubt, be reminded of the results of the referendum with regard to the Guruvayur Temple. But I refuse to accept a referendum, so overweighted as it was by the life of Mahatma Gandhi, as the normal result. In any such calculations, the life of the Mahatma must necessarily be deducted.
 If Hindu religion is to be a religion of social equality, then an amendment of its code to provide temple-entry is not enough. What is required is to purge it of the doctrine of chaturvarnya.

 LETTER FROM JAWAHARLAL NEHRUlibtech_568_footnote
 DEHRA  DUN JAIL,
 January 5, 1933
 
 MY DEAR BAPU,
 Your letter is always a tonic, and when it comes after a long interval, it brings  a thrill with it and its effect is all the more exhilarating. I recognized Mahadev’s handwriting on the envelope. Yours did not seem as of old. Perhaps your left hand was functioning and I am not so familiar with it.
 
 I am following of course with great interest your campaign against untouchability, as far as I can from The statesman and the Pioneer. Anything that you may do is bound to interest and fascinate. The subject itself has tremendous possibilities. Not being a man of religion, my interest is largely confined to the social aspect and to the wider issues involved.
 Of course Sarup should do untouchability work if she feels like it. My suggestion about a short holiday in Ceylon was made chiefly in the interest of Krishna. I am a little worried about her. After a year in prison, with our home practically broken up, she feels rather at a loose end and does not know what to do. Ever since her childhood the poor girl has been deprived of real home life and proper education because of our preoccupations and repeated visits to prison. She grew up a rather lonely girl not having as much friendship and sympathy as she was entitled to.
 Father’s death shook her up a great deal. I tried to soothe her and win her confidence and I am glad to say that I succeeded to some extent. But 1931 was for all of us a year full of work and worry and anxiety. Then came a long spell of prison for her, and for a young girl this was a far greater ordeal than it could be for most of us. As her release drew near I sensed how she must be feeling and how life in Anand Bhawan  as it is today would be no joy to her. She would feel out of joint. She would want to do something and yet not know what to do, and this would rob her of peace of mind. I was myself not clear what to suggest to her. Latterly she has begun to look upon me almost as a kind of refuge in a friendless world. If I had been out I might have been of help to her but I could do little from Dehra Dun Jail.
 I felt that a short holiday in neutral surroundings would ease her mind and remove the tension. Hence my proposal about Ceylon. Three weeks in Ceylon would not have solved any problem but she would have freshened up and returned with a brighter outlook on life. These were my reasons. I was thinking more of mental health than of physical health. But the proposal seems to have fallen through as nobody seems to be keen on it. In the present, therefore, Ceylon is off.
 Perhaps Krishna will go to Poona to see you and you might be able to advise her about her work. I might see her also. It is easy enough to suggest odd bits of work but this must appeal to the person concerned.
 As for my interviews, it is now nearly seven months since I had one. I have missed them greatly but the U. P. Govt. had been very discourteous to Mother and Kamala and I felt that I had no alternative; besides I have not yet got rid of my obstinacy—a hereditary failing in me of which you cannot be unaware. The Government made some partial amends and the Home Member, the Nawab  of  Chhatari, came and expressed his concern. All this was more or less beside the point and the graceful thing and the right thing was not done, but then the right thing is seldom done. I wrote again to Government. Still I decided in my mind that should
 special necessity arise I would withdraw my prohibition and consent to an interview. So matters have stood for the last few weeks. I did not suggest an early interview as there was some talk of my transfer back to Naini Prison.
 Now that you have also written about it, what can I do but immediately to capitulate to you? So henceforth, and unless something untoward intervenes, I shall take my usual interviews. Kamala may not be able to see me for several weeks still. She [ is] in Calcutta under Bidhan’s treatment. But I shall see Mother and Indu and Sarup and Krishna or such of them as can find me.
 The stopping of interviews has made me retire a little more into myself. But I have had pleasing and a friendly neighbour—the Himalayas. The sight of their outline against the sky, and now their summits and sides covered with fresh snow, have meant a geat deal to me. They seem to rouse in me ancient memories of the long ago when perhaps my ancestors wandered about the mountains of Kashmir and played in their snow and glaciers. I have had companions here but largely I have been left to myself, and I have grown a little contemplative, in defiance of heredity and family tradition and personal habit! But that is a thin veneer which I am afraid will rub off at little provocation. How can the Ethiopian change his skin?
 I have read a lot, and if wisdom could be had in books I would be wise. But wisdom eludes me, and big question-marks confront me wherever I look. Sometimes I think of Prince Siddhartha’s old question and no answer comes:
 How can it be that Brahma
 Would make a world and keep it miserable, Since, if all-powerful He leaves it so,
 He is not good, and if not powerful, He is not God?
 From all accounts in the papers you are as ever the slave of industry and are over-working yourself even in prison. The new industrial system of the West is often criticized and blamed because it makes man a machine for ceaseless work and robs him of all leisure. You are supposed to be no lover of this system. And yet, you seem to personify to me often this very industrial system !
 I am intrigued at your remark that eye-witnesses have told you that I am keeping fit. The information is correct but who could these eye-witnesses be who have managed to reach you? I have had no interviews for a long while and, except for   a colleague who was discharged a month ago, I can think of no other likely recent eye-witness. It is true that I am poorer by four teeth. I have sacrificed them at the altar of modern science to appease the goddess of physical health.
 This is a long letter for gaol. But this I am writing to you after over a year and I have not seen you for over sixteen months. My last glimpse of you was when you
 were sailing away to the far West and your figure grew smaller and smaller as the ship bore you away and left us, feeling rather lonely and forlorn, on the pier.
 With my love to all the happy family of yours in Yeravda.
 Yours affectionately,
 J.

 APPENDIX XV
 TALK WITH MATHURADASlibtech_569_footnote
 February 18, 1933
 [BAPU]: It is true that according to the Vedas the Shudras have no privileges; mainly they speak of only three varnas. However, the Vedas which are available to us are not the only ones. Of the thousands of books only a few have come down to us. There is religion as well as history in the Vedas. And history is not religion. The part dealing with religion is timeless and eternal whereas the one dealing with history describes the circumstances then prevailing. Who knows how long I have to live? But if I had no other task to demand my attention, I would certainly wish to take up the work of varnashramadharma. But the establishment of varnadharma needs the foundation of ashramadharma without which the whole structure would necessarily be weak. There is contentment at the root of varnashramadharma. It implies willing acceptance of one’s dharma and karma. Therefore varnashramadharma is a divine way of life whereas all the others are demoniac ones. Varnashramadharma has nobility as its predominant quality whereas the others are dominated by calculated selfishness.
 Once this law is understood many other things will follow. If we know how to drink water but do not know the science behind it, then it is of no use. If we know the various forms of water such as snow, vapour and hydro-electricity, then we can be said  to have understood the science of water. Similar is the case with varnashrama. This is   a principle applicable in all cases.
 [M.D.]: In other words, as Muslims claim that Islam means peace, and that it is the universal law meant for the whole world, you say that varnashramadharma is the universal law.
 BAPU: Yes, it is in the same sense. Every religion has some eternal principles and the followers of a particular religion follow their dharma in that measure. The rest of their religion is related to the circumstances of time and place.
 I would give up varnashramadharma this very day, were it not connected with
 
 birth. What would otherwise be left in it? I would maintain that the correct thing would be that the son of a carpenter should be a carpenter and not a blacksmith. If as a result there are to be hundreds of castes, let there be. So long as there is inter-dining and intermarrying among them let there be any number of castes. The restrictions about dining and marriage have turned the whole thing into a wretched affair.
 I would certainly say that Dronacharya had fallen from dharma. What I mean is not that a member of one varna may never follow the profession of another varna, but that it is not proper. This varnashramadharma as I propound it is for everybody to follow not blindly but after due deliberation. Like Hindus, Muslims also may follow it. It was in this sense that I described it as ‘Hinduism’s greatest gift to mankind’. With the observance of this dharma the entire community will be saved and it will become invincible.

 THE CLEANSERlibtech_570_footnote
 (A free rendering, from the Bengal;, of Satyendranath Datta’s “Scavenger”) Why do they shun your touch, my friend, and call you unclean?
 Whom cleanliness follows at every step, making the earth and air sweet for our dwelling, and ever luring us back from return to the wild?
 You help us, like a mother her child, into freshness, and uphold the truth, that disgust is never for man.
 The holy stream of your ministry carries pollution’s away and ever remains
 pure.
 Once Lord Siva had saved the world from a deluge of poison by taking it
 himself.
 And you save it every day from filth with the same divine sufferance.
 Come friend, come my hero, give us courage to serve man, even while bearing the brand of infamy from him.
