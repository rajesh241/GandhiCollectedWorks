 Recently I have been spinning on the Magan spinning-wheel. The left elbow is paining and the doctors say all it needs is rest. Since the pain has been caused by the exertion of drawing the thread in spinning for many years, I learnt to draw the thread with the right hand on the Gandiva spinning-wheel. But the doctors advised me not to exert the left hand even for rotating the wheel. Even otherwise, I had intended to learn spinning on the Magan spinning-wheel, and this advice gave me one more reason for taking it up. And so I have started spinning on it. I had a good deal of difficulty in learining to use it, but I may say that I have now acquired fairly good control over it. When I had good slivers, I had attained a speed of 150 rounds [per hour]. Just now I have been spinning with the worst possible kind of slivers. Thespeed is less but not much less than 100. I give some time to Urdu. And daily I read some book or other apart from star gazing. I have taken up the study in right earnest. I would not now show myself a complete ignoramus in discussing the subject with you. Among the books which I have seen, I have found Flammarion’s book the most useful so far. Dikshit’s booklibtech_784_footnotelibtech_785_footnoteseems to be the result of considerable labour, but, from a learner’s point of view, it requires a good deal of improvement. Patwa’s Akashdarshan can be of some help, but the book is very superficial. There ought to be one good  book  in  Gujarati, which should also give some information relating to astronomy. Two separate books in Gujarati for this purpose are not a practical proposition. We must have a book which would give both scientific knowledge of astronomy and practical guidance. If  you were with me here, I would have made you write such a book and I also would have made some contribution to it. I have come to take so much interest in the subject and perceived such deep religious significance in this study that, were not my knowledge altogether inadequate, I myself would have started writing such a book. I occasionally exchange letters with Hiralal on this subject. He has sent me two or three books. I read the biographies of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda written by Romain Rolland. One of them is being read by Mahadev now and the other by Sardar. (Sardar’s self-chosen job is to go through newspapers and to make beautiful envelopes from used brown paper or such other thick paper which we may get. Thus he is daily adding to the nation’s wealth and dust is being turned into gold, so to say.)
 
 Mahadev gives about five hours every day to carding and spinning. There is a friend of Chimanlal named Chhakkaddas who loves spinning very much. He has sent us beautiful slivers made from Cambodian and Navsari cotton. With those slivers Mahadev daily spins 650 rounds, the yarn being of 40 to 45 counts, and also cards an equal quantity from the cotton which we have received. Hence we always have a good stock of slivers with us. My experiment  of milkless diet continues. My weight is steady. All three of us are in good health.

  	It was very necessary for you to talk to me about Prabhudas. Because 	you did so, I have been able to take the necessary steps. That we 	should not be unhappy certainly does not mean that we should be     
 indifferent. When we see anyone suffering, whether the person is our relation or somebody else, we should do everything that is within our capacity and then stop feeling unhappy or worrying. Prabhu wrote to me a long letter and hence could not write to you. Only one letter once every three months [permitted]libtech_789_footnote.
 As for your health, till you are able to digest solid food, live only on fruit juice. You may take water in which vegetables have been cooked. Avoiding ‘starch’ means avoiding rice and wheat and avoiding ‘proteid’ means avoiding pulses and milk. Try this for a few days. Do not mind if you feel weak.
 At night, keep a mud-pack on the abdomen. Have sun-bath with the body uncovered. If you feel cold that way, remove one garment after another as the heat increases. Whether lying down or sitting, gently take deep breaths.

  LETTER TO D.V. PARACHURE SHASTRIlibtech_791_footnote 
 June 3, 1932
 All three of us were delighted to read our letter. How stupid of me to mistake Harolikar for Hukerikar. I am very bad at remembering names and faces. It gratifies me greatly that you are bearing with the disease so cheerfully. This is what I expected of you all.
 I am pained to hear of your wife’s ailment. Is someone looking after her? Has she any parents? I am sending you a bundle of slivers prepared by Mahadev. Do not hesitate to ask for more as our stock is always more than sufficient. Send me a list of the books you want, I shall try to procure them. Have you quoted that saying in reference to suicide from some book? My opinion in this matter is as follows: A person suffering from an incurable disease has the right to commit suicide if he cannot perform any service whatsover and lives only as a result of the ministrations of others. Fasting unto death is infinitely superior to drowning oneself. A person’s strength of character is tested in fasting moreover it leaves scope for changing one’s mind, which is both proper and necessary. But as long as he can perform the least bit of service, he is not justified in putting an end to his life. Although physical activity is an important and necessary feature of yajna a physically disabled person can certainly  perform  mental yajna which is not totally unfruitful. A man by his pure thoughts alone can render service. He can also be engaged in giving useful advice and such like. The thoughts of a man possessing a pure heart are an activity by themselves and can produce far-reaching results.

  LETTER TO JAL A.D. NAOROJIlibtech_792_footnote 
 June 4, 1932
 If Mr. Cooper’s plough is what he claims it to be, I should have no objection to its use merely because it is a steel plough  and therefore the village carpenter will be deprived of a portion of his work. I do not mind the partial deprivation of the carpenter if the plough increases the earning capacity of the farmer. But I have very
 
 grave doubts about the claims made by Mr. Cooper for the invention. At Sabarmati we have tried almost all improved ploughs manufactured in India and I think even others, but the claims made for each variety have not proved true in the long run. An experienced man has said that the indigenous plough is specially designed for the Indian soil. It conserves the soil, because it ploughs deep enough for the farmer’s crops but never deep enough to do damage. Of course I do not claim to understand agriculture. I am simply giving you the testimony of those who have had considerable experience in these matters. What we have to remember is that all improved implements have to meet the peculiar conditions of India. There is nothing wrong in an engine plough in itself and it may be a great advantage to a man who owns thousands of acres of land, and has a cracked caky soil, which will not yield under the indigenous plough. What, however, we want is an implement that would suit owners of small holdings from one acre to three acres. . . .
 I do not believe in the doctrine of the greatest good of the greatest number. It means in its nakedness that in order to achieve the supposed good of 51 per cent the interest of 49 per cent may be, or rather, should be sacrificed. It is a heartless doctrine and has done harm to humanity. The only real, dignified, human doctrine is the greatest good of all, and this can only be achieved by uttermost self- sacrifice.

  CONCERNING “TITIKSHA” AND “YAJNA”libtech_794_footnote 
 June 6, 1932
A friendlibtech_795_footnotesuffering from leprosy writes as follows:
 I am daily growing stronger in my faith that the best medicines for a person suffering from a disease like mine  are  asanas, pranayama and such other ordinary exercises and eating food earned through yajna. I spend my time in reading the Gita, singing bhajans, meditation and spinning more than 500 rounds of yarn daily. Our religion enjoins titiksha which means bearing all pains and miseries without opposing them even in thought, without worrying and without complaining. I am trying to cultivate such endurance, and I am discovering from experience that it is difficult to acquire such strength unless one works regularly for yajna. A person afflicted like me  cannot do other forms of yajna, but, thanks be to God, I can do yajna by sweeping public roads, removing night-soil and spinning, and I find my happiness in doing these things and try to  bear my misfortune. However, I often ask myself what my condition would be when the body became so weak that I could do no useful work. The Shastras emphatically declare that a life without yajna is as good as death, that it is a burden and an affliction to the world. You have said this repeatedly in your speeches and writings and my experience, too, tells the same thing. If that is so, the question arises: “What is the duty of a person who is so seriously ill with a disease that he can do no useful work at all and must live on the service of others?” I even read in a Shastra that a person who suffered from such an incurable disease should give up his life by drowning himself or  by  some similar means.
 This is only a summary in my own language of a beautiful letter. I wish to draw a lesson for ourselves from this letter, namely, that all of us should cultivate this friend’s capacity for endurance and, even when ill with a disease, should go on doing useful work as long as the body permits. That one must cultivate endurance and must do yajna—these are age-old ideals. We hear about them constantly in the Ashram. When, however, we read such things described by a person
 
 “Letter to Narandas Gandhi”, 2-6-1932
 who is relating his own experience, they seem something new and fresh and the description has great power in it. We do not expect a person suffering from leprosy to be able to write in this manner or to feel thus. In most cases such persons, if they write about themselves, tell us how they suffer and complain about their misfortune. Here we find something different altogether, and hence I have summarized the letter for the inmates of the Ashram. The question which is raised in it also deserves attention.
 We understand by yajna physical work voluntarily done for the service of others. But this need not be taken to mean that a person who is physically too weak to do such work performs no yajna. Such  a person can serve with his mental capacities in many ways, and his work would most certainly be yajna. But we can conceive of a case in which the person does not have the necessary degree of purity or sufficient mental strength for such yajna, and yet he is extremely eager to do it, has lost the desire to live, dislikes having to be served by others and is convinced that his disease is incurable. I think that, in such circumstances a person who has the necessary strength of mind may certainly give up his life, one may even say that it is his duty to do so. But to tell anybody that it is his duty to give up his life will probably shock him. It is not right for a healthy person to tell another who is suffering from a disease that it is his duty to give up his life. Such a remark may even upset that person. But I think that is not likely to happen in this case, and so I have cautiously stated what seemed right to me. It is certainly desirable that we should cease to fear death and give up the intense clinging to life which impels us to try to save it by trying every possible remedy and at the cost of  infinite trouble to people around us. My attitude in what I have written is that, if a thoughtful person afflicted with an incurable disease regards it his duty to give up his life, we need not think that what he does is absolutely wrong.

   LETTER TO G.D. BIRLA     BHAI 	GHANSHYAMDAS,    June 	7, 1932 
 I 	 have your letter. My health seems to  be   well  enough.  The weight 	is satisfactory. I weighed 106 libtech_796_footnotelibtech_797_footnote/ lb. today. Doctors tell me that  	I am suffering from tennis elbow as a result of spinning 	continuously for years; rest is the only cure for it. So I have to 	give complete rest to my elbow for 3-4 weeks. I started using the 	Magan spinning-wheel for this reason. Before that I was using my 	left hand for plying the wheel instead of holding the sliver. The 	doctors were not satisfied with this but they agreed to my turning 	the wheel with the foot. But now my elbow has been put in splints in 	order to prevent the least movement. Let us see now if the doctors’ 	diagnosis is correct or otherwise. You have no cause for worry, 	there being no pain except in moving the arm. Do send me the khadi 	woven out of the yarn spun by your sister. I overlooked writing on 	this matter as your letter was not in front of me. I have decided to 	study economics as much as I can while  I am still here. I took up 	the study of other books in the expectation of a long stay here. 	Anyway I shall start on economics very soon.  	I follow what you say about running the mill all day and night. So 	often have I had the idea of making a detailed observation of your 	mills but it came to nothing. I wish to watch the condition of the 	labourers with my own eyes. We are all doing well.

  LETTER TO MIRABEHN 
 
     CHI. 	MIRA,  [June 8, 1932]libtech_798_footnote 
  	Your letter came in today. Yes. the left arm is in splints. The 	passers-by who do not know the cause must be pitying me. If the 	packinig of the elbow does not improve it, I might have try milk. If 	I do, I shall also try the saltless experiment. But only when I 	learnt that there was no such thing as a thorough saltless 	experiment, I accepted the medical friends, advice and began taking 	salt. Milk contains plenty of salt as does water. And at a seaside 	place, you continually drink in salt. And yet there is decidedly 	some advantage in not  taking additional free salt as a condiment. 	What we get in water, milk and air is perhaps quite enough for the 	system. I have a prejudice in favour of saltless diet. Only I do not 	want to abstain from it religiously, unless I feel the necessity. 	Meanwhile your observations are accumulating. They will be useful.  	I do not quite understand the position about Verrier. What does he 	propose to do now? If the extension is only up to July, what is to 	happen thereafter? I have never understood the passport intricacies. 	If he cannot go to England, he must go to a hill station. Almora may 	be  a suitable place. If he is and is to remain vegetarian, he must 	copy your diet as closely as possible. Very little starch, no 	vegetable proteid in the shape of pulses, plenty of milk and fresh 	green vegetables. No potatoes and such other starchy vegetables. No 	condiments. Has he had my letter?  	What may be regarded as final answer has been received about you. 	The Government say they are informed that you were directing the 	movement before imprisonment and therefore you could not see me. I 	have combated that statementlibtech_799_footnoteand have said that you were under instructions not to 	take part in civil disobedience movement and that you were confining 	yourself to the khadi work and sending reports to friends! If I have 	erred, please correct me and I shall have no     
 hesitation in correcting myself.libtech_800_footnoteI do not know whether anything will result from my letter. Anyway, I am regarding the reply as a final decision and have accordingly asked N[arandas Gandhi] not to send anybody. I stopped interviews last week in anticipation, i.e., I did not see Manibehn and Dahyabhai.
 You should rejoice in this additional trial and be thankful that we can write to each other. But we should rejoice even if that stops. Nothing happens without divine permission. And how can we grieve over what He permits?
 You should correspond with Radha regularly. I believe your reading of her. I must not write about it. It will upset her. She may take things from you. You should make time for writing to her. I believe that her expenses are met from the Ashram and that she has not been now for some months a burden on Damodardas.
 You will have another talk with Damodardas and leave his place, if it will at all ease his burden.
Love from us all.

     LETTER TO H.S.L. POLAKlibtech_801_footnote   June 	8, 1932  	Shelibtech_802_footnotehas   	aged  considerably—in  some  respects  perhaps  more than I have. 	Spiritually she has made wonderful progress. . . .  	It will take me many incarnations to become disillusioned with the 	slowness of the charkha. The slowness of the charkha is perhaps its 	most appealing part for me. But it has so many attractions for me 	that  I can never get tired of it. It has a perennial interest for 	me. Its implications are growing on me and I make discoveries of its 	beauties almost from day to day. I am not using a sewing machine in 	its place or at all. I know how the mistake crept into the papers. 	My right elbow, having been used for turning the wheel, almost 	without a break for over ten years, began to give pain, and the 	doctors here came to    
 the conclusion that the pain was of the same type that tennis players often have after continuous use of the racquet. They therefore advised complete rest for the elbow. That might have meant cessation of spinning for some time, but for Prabhudas’s invention. You know Prabhudas, Chhaganlal’s son. His invention consists in turning the wheel with a pedal and thus freeing the right hand also for drawing the thread and practically doubling the output of yarn. I forestalled the doctors by having this wheel brought to me, and before the peremptory order to stop all work with the right elbow came, I was master of the pedal charkha called ‘Magan charkha’ after the late Maganlal. A stupid reporter who knew nothing about the invention, when he heard that I was moving the wheel with the pedal, came to the conclusion that I was working at the sewing machine and since there are Pressmen good enough to imagine many things of me and impute all sorts of things to me, they improved upon the false report by deducing disillusionment about the charkha from it. Now you have the whole story.

Whatever your financial condition, bear this in mind:
 One 	who earns money has 	the right to 	lose it.  There 	is no shame 	in losing 	money, but it 	is shameful, even 	sinful, to 	hide the 	fact of 	one’s loss.  One 	should never 	live beyond one’s 	means. Though one may be 	living in 	a bungalow 	today, one should 	be prepared 	to live 	in a 	hut tomorrow.  We 	need not feel ashamed 	if we do not 	have enough money 	to pay 	our creditors.  Anybody 	who hands 	over to his 	creditors everything 	without keeping 	back a single pie 	for himself has 	fully repaid his 	debt.  Wisdom 	lies first in not 	starting a 	business with 	borrowed money, 	but in 	case one has already 	done it, the next wise 	thing is to give away what one 	has and free oneself 	from one’s debts. 
 You may go to the Ashram whenever you wish to. [From Gujarati]

        DEAR 	COL. DOYLElibtech_803_footnote,   LETTER TO E.E. DOYLE     June 	9, 1932 
  	Major Bhandarilibtech_804_footnotehas 	infromed me of the Government’s decision about Shrimati Mirabai 	(Slade). I appreciate the frank reasons given for the decision. I do 	not know what the Government would call being “actively engaged in 	the furtherance of the civil disobedience movement”. It is likely 	too that the Government are misinformed. Obviously Mirabai has had 	no chance of refuting the information given to them. I can only 	reiterate my statement that like several other companions of mine 	she has been intentionally, and for the movement itself, kept out of 	its civil resistance part. But if Mirabai at any time was, or is 	now, actively engaged in the furtherance of the civil disobedience 	movement, my wife and my two sons were taking an active part in it. 	Yet if they were not in prison, being members of my family, they 	would, I presume, be allowed to see me. As I have made it clear to 	the Government in previous communications, I have long ceased to 	make any distinction between family members and others. My 	co-workers are as much members of my family as the members so 	called.  	Unless therefore the Government see their way to revise their 	decision, I must deny myself the pleasure of having weekly visitors. 	I enforced the self-denying ordinance on Saturday last. Indeed under 	the ruling given by the Government in Mirabai’s case it would be a 	serious thing for me to take the responsibility of deciding in the 	case of Ashram inmates who should and who should not see me.

Repeating Ramanama certainly does not 	mean repeating it mechanically with the lips. The preceptor of 	Ramanama believes that if a person repeats it mechanically but with 	faith, his faith itself will some day carry the name below the 	throat and right down to the heart. So long as this has not 	happened, one cannot have true peace. I know of no other remedy 	which could give you peace. You should cut down your intake of food 	as a medical necessity at least, and if even then you do not keep 	well you should try fasting, etc. I wrote a postcard to Pyarelal 	only a few days ago.

  LETTER TO PARASRAM MEHROTRA

CHI. PARASRAM,
 I got your two letters pinned together. I find that the short letter with paragraph headings is a summary of the first one and that it would be enough to read that alone. But it appears that you have also sent the original letter so that I may know more details if I wish.
 You should certainly not strain your will to use the limb which pains, that is, use it disregarding the pain. If you feel that because of such self-restraint the pain is gradually decreasing, you may conclude nothing else is necessary. If the pain does not decrease gradually even though you take care not to use that limb, there is no option but to take complete rest.
 There can be no one rule for all as to the time required for a meal. If somebody’s meal consists only of milk, it would take him only five to seven minutes to sip it. If somebody else’s meal consists only of one pomegranate and he has no teeth but has to eat the seeds instead of extracting the juice and drinking it, he may even take an hour to do so. Hence the following should be the rule: A meal should take up as much time as is required for chewing it properly, taking into consideration the type and quantity of the food.  Ordinarily, twenty to thirty minutes should be regarded enough for those who have good teeth and who eat rotlislibtech_805_footnotelibtech_806_footnote, dal, rice and vegetables. I have no faith in the common belief about sleeping with the head in a certain direction. I have never followed that rule.
 It is my belief that the peepul tree is considered sacred because it is very big, covers a large area with shade and can be grown almost everywhere.
 I understand what you say about the Hindi translation of my letters, etc. I shall be satisfied if everybody else is satisfied in this matter.

  A LETTER 
 June 9, 1932
 As you say, you are continually assailed by impure thoughts and feel miserable because of that. This is what is called self-made hell. This contains the replies to both your questions. It makes clear why I said what I did and also why such a state of mind is described as hell. If you understand the nature of this hell, it will also be easy for you to understand how you can come out of it. You should not brood over the fact that you get impure thoughts. Instead, you should go on as if they never troubled you. If a person who stumbles while walking does not stop to find out the cause of his stumbling, no harm will follow. If, on the contrary, such a person sits down on the road and goes on thinking why he stumbled, he will make no progress in his journey. But he will forget that he had stumbled if he does not think much about the fact and continues his journey. Since he is advancing, he gradually gathers strength and consequently stumblesless.

  LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL JOSHI 
 June 10, 1932
 Most of the manual work in the Ashram is done by the inmates themselves. There are a few hired labourers, but only those men who follow the Ashram rules fairly well have remained to work in that capacity and the inmates of the Ashram work with them. Gradually they are acquiring mastery over all types of work. Children also contribute their share
 Newcomers are first required to learn prayers, bhajans, etc. It is only after they have learnt these that those among them who wish to learn English may do so.
 
 All the inmates spin for yajna in company for one hour. Yarn of less than twenty counts cannot be included as part of one’s contribution through the spinning yajna. The yarn spun on a day has to be handed over to the depot on the same day. I have now suggested that, if all the people agree, no one should be permitted to buy the yarn spun by himself or herself for his or her own use.libtech_807_footnotelibtech_808_footnoteI have always believed that our yajna remains incomplete because of this freedom to buy one’s own yarn.
 Beginning last week, it has been decided to maintain an account of everybody’s labour at the rate of one anna per hour of work irrespective of the nature of work, though it has not been decided to make actual payments at this rate. Just now my  suggestion  to Narandas was merely that, if he agreed, he should immediately start keeping the records. These records will be in addition to the general records which are being kept now, and for the present we will merely note the results. They will give us much useful information and may also help us to realize the ideal of equality of work. In other words, all types of social service, whether spinning or weaving or cleaning lavatories, should be valued at the rate of one anna per hour of work. You probably remember that we have discussed this subject in the past at great length. Recently I have been writing to Narandas on a variety of subjects and among them I brought up this one again  for discussion. It seems to me that Narandas’s capacity for responding to such idea has increased considerably these days. He, therefore, welcomed my suggestion. These records do not require much time to maintain and, if the present experiment reaches the stage of implementation, the keeping of accounts would be so easy that even a person of ordinary education in Gujarati would be able to do the work. Success in maintaining accounts of this nature depends on the honesty of the people. If a person has not really worked for the number of hours which he enters against his name or supplies to the account-keeper, or if he has done the work carelessly, it is plain that the account will not be correct. That is, it will be like good and bad coins getting mixed up. I have been writing from here a great deal about children’s education too. I cannot tell how much of it the inmates of the Ashram will be able to adopt. It would require much time to discuss all that here, and I cannot spare it. Have patience in this matter.
 
 All of us should make the right use, according to our lights, of this priceless opportunity which we have got. The best use we can make of it is to cultivate the power of reflection. Our minds are oftenvacant and at such times the only thing we like to do is either to read or to talk. Some of us do think, but they only build castles in the air. Really speaking, just as reading is an art so is thinking. All our thoughts should occur to us at the right time. Just we do not read useless books, so also we should not let our minds run after idle thoughts. The power which is produced and conserved  by  such control over one’s thoughts can not be measured. I have felt during each term of imprisonment that it was the best time for learning to think in this manner.
 I, therefore, advise all of you to master the art of deep reflection. If you do so, you will not find it necessary to consult me frequently. But let no one misunderstand my meaning. I do not wish to forbid anyone to consult me. I only wish to cure people of excessive dependence on me. In case of necessity, however, my advice will always be available. It is your right and also your duty to take whatever advantage you can of my experience and the results of my reflection concerning matters of which I have had more experience and over which I have reflected more deeply than others."

  LETTER TO MATHURADAS PURUSHOTTAM 
 June 11, 1932
 CHI. MATHURADAS libtech_809_footnote,
 Why do you regard yourself responsible for Meghji’slibtech_810_footnotedeath? If you are responsible, how much greater is my responsibility? But even supposing you are, why grieve over it now? One should not keep thinking about the past. After drawing the proper lesson from it, one should forget it.
It will be better to keep a fixed time every day for writing the
 
 book on weaving and not spend the whole day on it. What is written in haste often turns out to be ill-digested. If one’s thoughts are perfectly clear, one always writes well and only such writing impresses.
 I always prescribe the same medicine. For all diseases, though known by different names, have one and the same cause. Hence the medicine for all of them must be one.
 I want you to become perfectly vigilant, build up strong health and start working regularly.

 BHAI NANABHAIlibtech_811_footnote,
 I got your postcard. I have not yet received Manilal’s letter. I have completely stopped seeing visitors. Even if this had not been the case, Medh could not have seen me without special permission. Nevertheless, when I receive Manilal’s letter, I will form some opinion from it if I can. From the fact that there has been no cable from Phoenix,  I  had  concluded  that  Manilal  and  Sitalibtech_812_footnotewere  quite   well. About the latter, I came to know only from your postcard. I had heard from Surendra that he was well in Visapur.

  	I did not consider your letter too long, for you have given in it an 	account of your visits such as I had wanted you to give. I have been 	to Sinhagarh thrice. Once I went there while the Lokamanya was also 	therelibtech_821_footnote, and 	we met each other a good many times. I saw his house. You have 	certainly described a few things about which I did not know. I did 	meet Hari Narayan Aptelibtech_822_footnote. 	I certainly with to read his novels,but I do not have the courage to 	take up anything new just now. Urdu, economics, watching the sky, 	spinning and writing letters—these keep me busy enough.

In favourable circumstances, everyone can 	behave in a manner which will win him or her the good opinion of 	others.  	There was no special meaning behind my question. “Are you 	satisfied now?” I asked the question only casually. Sushila may 	not have felt hurt, but I myself felt sorry. Having permitted her to 	come with you, I should have talked with her a little. But I had no 	time and so contented myself with an inquiry about Jamnadas. My 	blessings to her.  	I certainly intended to write on the subject of sex. But it would be 	better if you ask me specific questions. We need not stop the 	teaching of English. All that I meant was that we should not teach 	it to new pupils before they have learnt the other things. I have 	written more about this in my letter to Narandas.

  LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI 
 June 8/13, 1932
 CHI. NARANDAS,
 I had got your postcard before I received the other post from you today, but I did not reply to it in a separate letter since I had written in detail about Narayanappa in the letter which was dispatched yesterday along with the other letters. I have now received a negative reply in regard to Mirabehn. It was good, therefore, that I had already decided provisionally not to see visitors. That being so, though Durga and Anandilibtech_826_footnotehad come today to see us, Vallabhbhai and I could not see them. Mahadev went and saw them. We certainly felt unhappy but it is only by swallowing such bitter draughts that one can preserve dharma. I, therefore, welcomed the pain that I felt.
 I am very happy that you have decided to follow the method of calculating the value of work at the rate of one anna per hour. I think we shall make some important discoveries by following it. In order that the account may be properly kept, everybody should know  exactly how long one has worked. That means that you will have to strike the bell for each hour or will have to devise some other method so that everybody can know how much time has passed. Secondly, the information about the hours of work supplied by every inmate must be correct. If it is clearly realized that time is money, it will be seen that giving wrong information will be like passing off counterfeit coins. Our records will be wrong and, in consequence, our conclusions will be wrong too. I think for at least one month the slips received from everybody should be preserved. To facilitate this, I suppose all the inmates are supplied slips of the same size. The slips should be
 
 filled in clear handwriting. Now that I think about the matter as I dictate these lines, I feel that you yourself need not keep a daily record. Your record will be the slips. If we decide to preserve them permanently, they can be pasted [in an account book] but I do not think that is necessary at all. As the slips are received, the hours mentioned in them may be entered in the ledger. If you object that, in that case, we would not know for how many hours each type of work was done, you may enter the hours under separate heads of work. However, to be able to use that information you will have to maintain a double-entry account, that is, keep the record under each name and each type of work separately. Only then will you be able to draw up quickly a summary every month showing the hours given by each person and the total number of hours spent on each type of work. I do think that for our purpose information under both heads will be necessary. At the moment I cannot think of any other suggestions besides these. Your account of your own daily work seems all right.  If necessary, you may reduce yajna work from two  hours  to something less. If anybody gives money equal to the value of the yarn spun by him, instead of the yarn itself, his yajna is certainly imperfect, since it is marred by his desire to wear cloth woven from his own yarn. That is, he spins yarn of the fine count through his selfish desire to be able to wear cloth woven from such yarn. Ideally,one should not wish to all to derive any personal benefit from work done for yajna or from any gift made as yajna. Anybody who works for yajna may take from what he produces only as much as would be the share of each if the total quantity were divided equally among all the persons for whom he works. We claim that we work for the 300 millions of our countrymen. If so, we may certainly have 1/300 millionth share of the yarn which we spin, imagining that that share is mixed with the yarn from which the cloth of our garments is woven. I know that many arguments have been advanced, from the point of view of increasing the production of fine khadi, against my stand, and I admit the force of those arguments. That is why I have tolerated yajna which is only half pure. But I have always felt within myself that such yajna is imperfect. If you clearly see the imperfection to which I am drawing attention, you should hand over all the yarn which you spin and overcome your desire to get cloth woven from it for your or Jamna’s use. When all the yarn received is mixed together and woven into cloth, you may take from it what you require. If you see any error in my reasoning, please point it out to me. And you need not follow my
 suggestion though you may agree with me, if you feel  that  it  is beyond your capacity at present to do so—irrespective of whether the reason is Jamna or yourself. If we voluntarily start doing something which we had not been doing up to now, we experience nothing but intense joy from that and feel that a heavy load has been taken off our head. Do not act upon my suggestion till you feel thus. As I stated ina previous letter, I want everybody’s yajna to be perfect, but I should like to wait till all people are convinced of the correctness of my view. I see from your letter, however, that they have now come so far that it should not be difficult to take that last step, if it is not implied in what they have agreed to. I have interpreted your letter to mean that everybody would spin for yajna in the porch between 12.30 and 1.30 and hand over there and then the yarn spun by him or her. Literally understood, this means that one cannot even buy back that yarn. If this is to apply to all, you also will have to hand over the yarn spun by you. Your statement, however, that the yarn spun during that time will be handed over may also mean that a person may buy back his or her yarn for personal use. If so, the arrangement will have the  imperfection which I have remarked above. I should be happy if all agree to remove this imperfection. If they agree, however, everybody should understand that he will have to spin in future even more carefully than he had been doing up to now when he knew that he was spinning the yarn for his own use.
 I have been spinning for the last ten days or so with such bad slivers as I have never used before. I am doing this purposely. I wrote to Premlilabehn requesting her to send me some cotton, and in reply she immediately sent slivers. The slivers with which I have been spinning are from this lot. It certainly cannot be thrown away as useless. That would mean being light-hearted about work, Nor can I send these silvers to the women prisoners. If the slivers are good enough for them I would say that they were twice for me. I, therefore, decided to use them up. I realize from my experience the great difference between good slivers and bad slivers. Theoretically I always understood it, but I realized it from experience only now, for ordinarily I would always get good slivers. Whenever I myself have carded cotton I have done so very carefully. Hence  I  do  not remember to have spun with such bad slivers any time in the past. And  I see from Mahadev’s spinning what difference good  cotton  can make.
My purpose in writing about all this is to point out that, if we
 wish to spin for yajna the finest yarn that we can, the slivers with which we spin should be of the best quality and the cotton must be perfectly clean. The spinning-wheel also should be in good condition. If these conditions are fulfilled, no one will find the one hour of spinning boring. On the contrary, the smoothly rotating spinning- wheels would make such sweet music when so many persons spin in complete silence that the hour would pass as but one minute and give perfect joy. Even the most interesting activities will only bore a personwho does not understand their value or who feel aversion towards them. Here ends my sermon on account-books and on yajna.
 I have already said above that I will not see visitors now. Do not worry about my hand till I tell you that the condition  is  serious enough to cause worry, for I am keeping back nothing about it. I see no necessity to keep back anything. We aspire to learn to bear everything that may happen to us. If so, it would be altogether wrong to keep back anything relating to illness or pain. The left elbow is in plaster just now. I, therefore, present a pitiful sight, though there is no reason at all to pity me. If the cause of the pain in the elbow is no other than the excessive work I have done with that arm, it is obvious that it should be given complete rest. Since the only way of doing that is to put it in plaster, that has been done. We shall know the effect in a week or two. If the elbow requires only rest, the officials themselves will obtain whatever external aid may be required. In other respects my health is very good. The weight is 106 libtech_827_footnote/ pounds, that is, it has been increasing. Though I can work only with one arm, and despite the trouble which bad slivers give, I can spin more than 200 rounds daily. I can also read for a while. I practise, like a child, writing large Urdu letters in a copy-book. I would not be able to do all this if my health was not good. The mind would simply not work.
 I think your decision regarding Jayantiprasad’s daughter is perfectly all right. You should not assume new responsibilities just now. If the girl were capable of looking after herself and were healthy,  I would have certainly felt tempted to take her in.
Chimanalallibtech_828_footnotelibtech_829_footnoteshould improve his health anyhow.
 Leave Parnerkarlibtech_830_footnoteto solve his problem by himself. If he can stay, we certainly want him to do so. If he cannot, we need not press him. The verse in the Gita which asks what avails a man to force himself
 
 beyond a certain point applies in this case too.
 The fact that you do not find Savitribehn’s address there means,  I suppose, that you have not been getting any letters  from  her  recently. But her connection with the Ashram is not recent. You may find some of her old letters lying somewhere. Moreover, if corresp- ondent’s addresses are being preserved in the Ashram, her address must have been written down somewhere. If anybody goes to thepress, we are bound to have her address on its record. She has also written a book about me, in which she has reproduced some of my letters. You may possibly find her address in these. However, I do not want you to spend too much of your time in finding it.
 Father Elwin has not explained why he suggested Friday for a Christian prayer. On Sunday evenings pious Christians will have gone to churches and will be attending special services, so that Sunday may not suit them for the purpose of the public communion which he has in view. Moreover, Friday is the day of Jesus’s crucifixion, and Father Elwin may have selected it for that reason. But this is only my guess. I very much like the idea that we should fix one day in the week for a Muslim prayer. If Friday is not available now for that purpose, we may fix Thursday. Thursday means Jummerat, and I think that day also is holy for Muslims. To us, however, all days and hours are equally holy. It is enough if we pray with sincere devotion.
 We also had read here in the papers about the suitcase. Hence Mahadev believes that we must have lost one. Aluvihari was with us all the time and was one of the party. It seems that, having read about the suitcase in the papers, he went and claimed it. Mahadev  cannot guess— and if he cannot, how can I?—whose clothes and books it contains. Well, it is safe now. Aluvihari will probably send it to you, or may use his judgement and do with it what seems best to him. I expect to hear from him.
 I have always considered that the rule that newcomers should not be permitted to start immediately on English is a correct one. My stand is that they may learn English, must learn it, but only after they have acquired a working knowledge of Sanskrit, Hindi and the Urdu script, learnt music well enough to join in singing bhajans and mastered all the processes relating to spinning. I think a person of average ability would take one year to complete this programme, though it is likely that some may take more than that and some less. Those who have joined the Ashram for life or have joined it
 temporarily with the aim of training themselves for service should have no special attraction for English. If anybody feels it, he should know that he cannot satisfy his desire in the Ashram. Nobody should understand from this that we proscribe English from the Ashram or do not love it as much as others do. Our only aim is to see that it does not occupy a place which does not belong to it. For many persons knowledge of English is essential even for the purpose of service, butwe can give instruction in it in the Ashram only in a manner convenient to the Ashram and consistent with its aims. We are entitled to expect this patience in all inmates of the Ashram.

 Regarding Imam Saheb’s tomb, Pyare Ali asked Khatib Saheb for his opinion. The latter said that Islam does not approve of the erection of tombs. You should, therefore, put a few blocks of stones on the spot to mark it off and to prevent the ground being used for any purpose. Take or send some Muslim to the place and ask him to arrange a few stones. If there is no objection to our laying them, somebody from among ourselves may arrange them.

 The plaster on the left arm has been removed. There has been no improvement. The cause of the pain, therefore, must be something else. But there is no cause whatever for worry. Mirabehn is on saltless diet at present, and therefore, had been pressing me to adopt it. I started it yesterday. For me it is child’s play to live on such diet, for I
 
 have done that for eight years. I shall have fresh experience of it now. If there is anything to write about, I will do so before the next letter is due.

  LETTER TO BHARATI 
 June 13, 1932
 I got your letterlibtech_832_footnotewritten in beautiful handwriting. I cannot have too many such letters.
 I would certainly be pleased if you brothers and sisters became as strong and sturdy as steel and could endure heat and cold. But I cannot all at once make such and experiment on you in the heat (sic) of Simla. Training in such endurance would be fruitful only if it is undergone methodically and step by step. It is a grave error to believe that a person who generally lives a sheltered life can suddenly become hardened when the need arises. That would be going against nature. I remember hundreds of instances of persons who made such mistakes.
 I would certainly enjoy reading literature. During my school days I could not read anything outside the syllabus. After that I got involved in so may activities one after another that I could get little time to read,. Whatever I did read was in jails. But I do not think that I have lost much because of this. I got a great deal of time for thinking. And, moreover, what one learns in the school of experience is always more useful than reading.
 Even those who profess to cultivate art for its own sake are not really able to do so. Art has a place in life though what is art is a different question. But, art and such other things are mere means in the path that we with to tread. When they become ends in themselves they become shackles and drag us down.
 God is Truth. For the past few years I have been saying that ‘Truth is God’ instead of saying that ‘God is Truth’. I feel that this is a more logical way of putting it. Truth is the only reality in this world. Here Truth should be given a wider connotation. It is something living. This Truth that is God and the laws of God are not distinct
 
 from one another but are the same thing. Hence Truth, too, is a living thing. Thus it means the same thing to say that this world is governedby Truth or by God’s laws. There is infinite power in that Truth.According to Chapter X of the Gita, it may be said that the world is sustained by just a fraction of that power. You will, therefore, understand that I mean by God if you read, “Truth” wherever the word “God” occurs.
 If God exists—though we call Him Truth—it is our duty to worship Him. We become like that which we worship. Prayer means nothing more than this. But does not that meaning of prayer explain everything? Truth dwells in our hearts, but we are not aware, or fully aware of the fact. This awareness comes through sincere prayer. . . libtech_833_footnote

For a prisoner’s curiosity can only be idle, as he can do nothing even if he came to know certain things through indirect of illegitimate means. And what is perhaps more, I have abundant faith in friends doing their very best so long as they believe in the justice of the cause.

  	I could not reply to your letter of the 6th last week. Meanwhile, I 	got another letter from you this week. I understand your reason for 	discontinuing to send Vinoba’s discourses. His prohibition is 	right.  	Yes, there was some misunderstanding on my part regarding the 	paintings of scenes from the Ramayana. I do not see anything 	objectionable in meditating over a figure drawn as purely imaginary. 	If, however, meditating on the Gita can satisfy you, where is 	the need for any other object of meditation? There are two ways of 	meditating on the Gita. Since we look upon the Gita as 	Mother,  you  may meditate on a painting or photograph of your 	mother, you require one (and if your mother is dead), thinking of 	her as the  kamadhenulibtech_842_footnotein the form of the Gita. Alternatively, you may 	have an imaginary picture of the Gita in your mind. You may 	even think of her as Mother Cow. I think it would be better if you 	could follow the second way. You may, at that time, meditate on any 	verse or phrase from the chapter of the Gita which you may 	have recited on that day or from any other chapter. All the words in 	the Gita are so many ornaments on the body of Mother Gita and, 	therefore, meditating on any one of them amounts of meditating on 	the Gita herself, just as meditating on an ornament worn by 	the woman whom one loves amounts to meditating on herself. But one 	may also meditate on the Gita in any other way that one can 	think of. There are as many ways as there are brains. No two persons 	meditate in the same way even on one and the same object. There will 	always be some difference between the exact pitures of the object 	imagined by them and their descriptions of it.  	According to Chapter VI, even the least sadhana is not 	wasted, and we resume our sadhana in our next life from the 	point where we had stopped. Similarly, a person who desires to turn 	towards spiritual living but lacks the necessary strength for the 	purpose  will  have greater strength of mind in his next life. I 	have no doubt about this at all in my mind, but it does not mean 	that we can relax our effort in this life. If we think in that 	manner, our desire for a spiritual living is    
 not sincere. Or, it is a desire of the intellect and not of the heart, and a desire of the intellect has no value at all. It will not survive one’s death. On the other hand, a desire which has been accepted by the heart cannot but inspire sincere effort to fulfil it, though it is quite possible that owing to various cirmustances or weakness of the body our desire may not be fulfilled during this life. We have experience of this every day. But the desire will cling to the soul when it leaves the body, and in the next life the difficulties which stood in the way of itsfulfilment during this life will diminish and the desire will  be fulfilled or will at least become stronger. Thus a person who aspires after spiritual life is ever advancing.
 It may be that Jnaneshwar Maharaj meditated on Nivrittinathlibtech_843_footnotewhile the latter was alive, but I am strongly of the view that we should not follow his example. If we meditate on a person, he must have attained perfection. It is altogether improper, and also unnecessary to ascribe perfection to a living human being. It is possible, however, that Jnaneshwar Maharaj did not meditate on the real Nivrittinath, but meditated on the perfect Nivrittinath of his imagination. But why should we need at all concern ourselves with this problem? when the question is about the propriety of meditating on a living human being, we need not bring in the question of meditating on our mental image of that person and any reply on the propriety of that is likely to confuse the reason of the other person.
 The names which are given Chapter I are, according to me, more the names of certain qualities than of real persons. While describing the divine and the demoniac forces in our nature, the poet has personified them. In saying this, I do not deny the possibility of an actual battle between Kauravas and Pandavas having taken place near Hastinapur. My belief is that the poet took a well-knwon event of that age as an example and used it as material for his immortal work. I may be mistaken in this belief and all those names may be the names of real persons. If so, it was not improper for the poet to give those names at the commencement of his historical narrative, and, since the first chapter is necessary for introducing the subject, it is necessary to recite it as part of ceremonial recitation of the Gita.
 If we spin with slivers made by somebody else, our spinning yajna is certainly imperfect. A person like me may not be able to make his own slivers at present owing to physical weakness, but those
 
 who can should make their own slivers.
 I consider it necessary for everybody to learn spinning on the takli and gain mastery over it. I know that Vinoba regards it as a much easier means for the yajna of spinning. I have not come to a final decision about this, nor do I wish to do so without discussing the matter at length with Vinoba. I am, therefore, not particular either way. You should, however, discuss your suggestion with Narandas. I also will do so.

But there is nothing to be 	afraid of. You should tell very plainly that you have been living 	with Ba and Bali since childhood, and that you do not with to live 	with Harilal at all. Even parents cannot claim custody of grown-up 	children. Hence it depends on your own wish where you will live. 	Nobody can force you to marry against your will. You should, 	therefore, always remember that it is in your own power to save 	yourself. I can write in this way and give you courage, but as 	prisoner I cannot give anything in newspapers.

  A LETTER 
 June 15, 1932
 Like you, some others also believe that I live a life of self- control and observe brahmacharya, and that, therefore, I was sure to live long. This belief about me is not correct, or it is correct only partially in contrast with how other people live. I indulged in sexual pleasure nearly up to the age of 30. Nor can I claim that I exercised self-control in eating. I used to eat all kinds of delicacies for themere pleasure of the palate. Then I steadily drifted towards restrain. But this does not mean at all that I have overcome the cravings of the senses. All I can claim is that I have learnt to hold them under control. Thus, self-indulgence had already had its effect on my body, but it has been counteracted in the measure that I have acquired self-control. My contemporaries who do not exercise even that much self-control naturally wonder at my self-control such as it is and do not observe my weakness. . . libtech_847_footnote
 The privileges which I enjoy as a prisoner are not because of my being placed in a particular class. I am not treated as an ordinary convict. Prisoners of my categorylibtech_848_footnotelibtech_849_footnoteare entitled to many privileges. This, of course, is no defence of what I do. Though the Government does give certain privileges to a prisoner like me, it certainly depends on the prisoner himself whether or not to avail himself of those privileges. Hence the misunderstanding which you mention is quite natural. But I regard it in public interest to continue to avail myself of the privileges even at the risk of incurring such a misunderstanding. But it should not be necessary for me to defend this point of view. Its correctness should be self-evident. Even if it is not, I should cling to it so long as I believe it to be earnest. This reasoning applies to every captain of a ship. A captain cannot always explain the reasons for the cours which he is following. But he would not deserve to be a captain if he listens to the advice of others and give up what he believes to be the right course. Such captains are known to have wrecked on rocks the ships under their charge. Hence persons like you may certainly caution me whenever they have doubt about the propriety of my actions. If, however, I do not change my policy even after that, they should have faith that what I am doing is right. It does happen
 
 sometimes that such faith proves to be misplaced. But there is no other way of managing public affairs. At the moment I am confident that, when I feel that I ought not to avail myself of a particular privilege or of any of them, I shall have the strength to renounce it or them. In South Africa I spent fairly long periods of imprisonment as an ordinary prisoner.
 From whom did you hear that story about Krishnadaslibtech_850_footnote? There is no truth in it at all. Krishnadas was certainly not sent away. For somereasons he himself asked for leave to go. But though he has left, our relations have remained the same. It is against my nature to take any such step at somebody’s instigation. And nobody instigated me to take such a step in regard to Krishnadas. All the same I wish to know the source of this story. If you think you can tell me, please let me know.

 APPENDICES
 
 
              DEAR MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX I  LETTER FROM SIR 	SAMUEL HOARElibtech_851_footnote        April 13, 1932 
  I 	write this in 	answer to 	your letter 	of 11th 	March and I say 	at once 	I realize 	fully the 	strength of 	your  feeling 	 upon  the  question  of  	 separate   electorates  	for the 	“Depressed” Classes. 	I can 	only say 	that we 	intend to 	give any 	decision that may 	be necessary solely 	and only 	upon the merits 	of the 	case. As 	you are aware, 	Lord Lothian’s 	Committee has not yet 	completed its 	tour and 	it must be 	some weeks before 	we can receive 	any conclusions 	at which 	it may 	have arrived. When 	we receive 	the report 	we shall 	have to give 	most careful 	consideration to its 	recommendations and 	we shall 	not give a 	decision until we 	have taken 	into account 	in addition 	to the 	view expressed 	by the Committee 	the views 	that you and those 	who think 	with you have 	so forcibly expressed.  I 	feel sure if 	you were in 	our position 	you would be 	taking exactly the 	same action 	we intend 	to take. 	You would await the Committee’s 	report, you would then 	give it 	your fullest 	consideration and before 	arriving at a 	final decision 	you would 	take into 	account the views that 	have been expressed on 	both sides of the controversy. More 	than this I cannot 	say. Indeed 	I do 	not imagine 	you would 	expect me 	to say more.  As 	to the Ordinances, I can only repeat what I have already said both 	publicly  and 	privately. I 	am convinced 	that it 	was essential 	to impose 	them in 	the face of 	the deliberate 	attack upon 	the very foundations of 	orderly government. I 	am also convinced 	that both the Government 	of India 	and the local 	Governments are 	not abusing 	their extensive powers 	and are doing everything 	possible to 	prevent excessive or 	vindictive action. We 	shall not keep the 	Emergency measures in 	force any 	longer than we 	are obliged to 	for the purpose of 	maintaining the 	essentials of 	law and 	order and 	protecting our 	officials and 	other classes of 	the community 	against terrorist outrages.

 EXTRACTS FROM MIRABEHN’S LETTERlibtech_853_footnote
 
 April 8, 1932 Received a letter from Mirabehn with 24 pages, every line of it instinct with spotless devotion. She would not be happy unless she lived with and rendered
 personal service to Bapu. But Bapu wants her to get rid of this desire, as otherwise she
 would feel herself stranded when Bapu was no more with us. This controversy has been on ever since Mirabehn came to India. In today’s letter she has poured out her wonderfully transparent heart:
 Bapu, I am never without that thought in my mind, as to how best to serve you. I think and pray and reason with myself, and it always ends the same way in my heart of hearts. When you are taken from us, as in jail, an instinct impels me to work with all my strength at outward service of your cause. I feel no doubt and no difficulty. When you are with us, an equally strong instinct impels me to retire into silent
 
 personal service—trying to do anything else, I feel lost and futile. The capacity for the former depends on the fulfilment of the latter. The one is the counterpart of the other, and something continually tells me that it was for fulfilment in that way that I was led to you. The instinct is so strong that I cannot get round it or through it or over it. It is difficult to ask you to have faith in it as the full proof of its correctness can only leave it at that. This much I know full well that during this struggle my strength, capacity and inner peace and happiness are much greater than last time, because I had been able to serve according to my instinct (except for one short spell of anguish since your previous release). The fact that I was on the point of a breakdown when I came here had nothing to do with this question. It was sheer over-work, because when I saw that I was shortly going to be arrested, I simply spent my strength recklessly, knowing an enforced rest was coming. And there was more than enough work around me to be reckless over.
 Who knows if it is all delusion! But a woman has to go by instinct. It is stronger with her than any amount of reason, and her full strength can only be harnessed and brought into service if her nature is able to express itself. I have no thought, no care, no longing in all the world except for you— (you the cause—you the ideal.) To serve that cause in this life and to reach that ideal in after-life, Godwho has brought me from utter darkness to the light of your path will surely not answer my prayers by leaving me now to follow a wrong instinct. I have not written all this for the sake of argument, but simply to share with you the result of my ceaseless strivings to (understand) since I have been in jail.

 DEAR MR.,
 Reference your D. O. of 22nd instant.
 I have written to Belgaum for detailed particulars regarding the persons in whom you are interested—and hope to be in a position, within the week, to let you have the information you desire.
 If circumstances permit, I intend visiting Belgaum as early as possible, and will then be able to give you first-hand information.
 
 I can find no reply to Major Martin’s letter so I presume, an answer was addressed to him by name, and is now chasing him to England. I trust, though, that I shall soon have all the information you require.

 RABINDRANATH TAGORE’S APPEALlibtech_858_footnote
 VISWABHARATI, SANTINIKETAN,
 BENGAL,
 March 22, 1932
 From the depths of the present atmosphere of suffering the cry has come for the inauguration of a new age of faith and reconciliation, for a fellowship of understanding between races and nations alienated by cruel politics and diplomacy. We in India are ready for a fundamental change in our affairs which will bring harmony and understanding into our relationships with those who have inevitably been brought near to us. We are waiting for a gesture of goodwill from both sides, spontaneous and generous in its faith in humanity, which will create a future of moral federation, of constructive works of public good, of the inner harmony of peace between the peoples of India and England.
 The visit of our friends from England has confirmed the immediate possibility of such an intimate fellowship and truth in our mutual relationship, and I feel called upon to appeal to all who have the welfare of humanity at heart to come forward at this critical hour and courageously take upon themselves the task of fulfilling the moral responsibility, which is before us, of building upon the bare foundation of faith or acceptance of truth in a spirit of generous mutual forgiveness.
 The memory of the past, however painful it may have been for us all, should never obscure the vision of the perfect, of the future which it is for us jointly to create. Indeed, our experience of the futility of suspicion and hostility must inspire us with a profounder belief in the truth of the simple fellowship of hearts, in the mighty power of creative understanding between individuals as well as nations inspired by a common urge of love.
