Speaking on the war effort in his division, Mr. Galletti assured himself that the satyagrahis could not do anything ‘prejudicial’, even if Mr. Gandhi came and had his say.” Referring to the correspondence between Gandhiji and E. E. Mack (vide pp. 315 and 329), Galletti is stated to have said that “ ‘Gandhiji, as everyone knew, would not go out of his spiritual determination.’ He quoted the analogy of Quakers who had conscientious objection to war but at the same time came forward to the relief  of the victims in war. The same was the view of Gandhiji. But what was the Provincial Congress Committee doing? There were a number of Congressmen who were angry with Gandhiji for his opinion on Congressmen’s participation in Red Cross work. There were a few sincere Congressmen but most lacked honesty. Many of them . . . were inconsistent.”"

Rau in January 1941, “to 	examine the Hindu Women’s 	Rights to Property Act of 1937 (as amended by Act XI of 1938) 	with particular reference to 	five private Bills.” 	The report, 	which was published 	from New Delhi on 	July 26, advocated 	“immediate admission of 	the daughter 	to an 	equal share with the 	daughter-in-law”. It 	suggested “legislation 	for agricultural 	land, with 	retrospective effect, in 	order to 	give widows 	the full measure 	of multiplicity 	of rules 	of succession”. 	The Committee 	had recommended 	“preparation” in 	gradual stages, of 	a complete 	code of 	Hindu Law” beginning 	with the 	law of succession, 	instead of piecemeal 	legislation. The task of codification of Hindu Law was completed  by 	the Committee 	on August 	4, 1941."

He met Mohandas K. Gandhi and prevailed upon 	him through greater religious fervour than even India’s scrawny 	little saint could muster. ‘You can’t argue with Jesus Christ’, 	commented Mahatma once, following a long conference from which he 	had emerged second best.”"

If I 	were to 	get in the hallway of 	the Government 	buildings at New Delhi, 	squat on the floor 	and refuse 	to eat a bit until 	the Indian 	Civil Disobedience Movement came to 	terms, the 	trouble would be 	over in 	  a few 	days. Of 	course, before those few 	days could elapse, my 	Liberal, Conservative 	and Labour 	colleagues in London 	would send for me to come 	home and would 	have a padded cell 	waiting for me on my arrival.’ ”"
