       HOUSE 	OF COMMONS,  November 	5, 1906  DEAR 	SIR,  	A meeting of the Liberal, Labour and Nationalist Members of this 	House will take place at 6 p.m. on Wednesday next, the 7th inst. in 	the Grand Committee Room, to hear the British Indian Deputation that 	has arrived from the Transvaal, in connection with the Ordinance 	passed by the Legislative Council of that Colony, termed the Asiatic 	Law Amendment Ordinance, and to pass a resolution.  	In the opinion of the Delegates, the Ordinance reduces the British 	Indian settlers of the Transvaal to a position much worse than they 	occupied under the Boer regime and even than  that  of the Kaffirs.  	They contend that the Ordinance in question is in contravention of 	promises repeatedly made by British Ministers and in conflict with 	British traditions.  	The undersigned trust that you will be good enough to attend the 	meeting.  We 	are, Yours faithfully,  HENRY COTTON	R. LEHMANN  H. COX	J. 	M. ROBERTSON 	CHARLES W. DILKE	A. 	H.

 I beg to draw your attention to the copy of  Indian  Opinion for the 13th of October, herewith enclosed.

We are now sending your name to Lord Elgin as a member of the deputation. As you know, the deputation will meet Lord Elgin on Thursday next at 3 p.m. at the Colonial Office. All the members of the deputation have been requested to attend at the Colonial Office at
 2.30 p.m., so that a short conference may be held. Sir Lepel Griffin will  head  the   deputation.  I  beg  to  enclose  herewith   a   list   of the
 
 members forming the deputation, as also a copy of the Representation to Lord Elgin which will form the basis of submission to him on Thursday, and copy of the precis of the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinancelibtech_13_footnote.
 I hope you have received the Circular issued  by  several members of the House of Commons, convening a meeting of the Liberal, Nationalist, and Labour Members of Parliament. I venture to trust that you will find time to attend the meeting. If possible, Mr. Ally and I will take an opportunity of sending in a card to you at the House, so that we may be able to place the position before you more fully than we could at the conference on Thursday.

 [ENCLOSURE]
 Precis of Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, 1906libtech_14_footnote
 [LONDON,]
 November 2, 1906
 DEFINITION: The term “Asiatic” shall mean any such person as is described in Article 1 of Law [3] of 1885.
 The term “Asiatic” under Law 3 of 1885 includes the so called coolies, Arabs, Malays, Mohammedan subjects of the Turkish Dominions.
 This Ordinance however excepts the Malays from  its operation.
 Registration: Section 3 requires every lawfully resident Asiatic in the Transvaal to be registered, for which no charges shall be made, and in accordance with the section, an Asiatic lawfully resident is one who has received, or may receive, a permanent permit to enter and reside in the. Transvaal, unless such permit is fraudulently obtained, or any Asiatic resident and actually in the Transvaal on the 31st day of May 1902.
 SECTION 4: Requires every such Asiatic to make an application for registration, such application to be made in the case of children under 16 years of age by their parents or guardians.
 SECTION 5: Lays down that, if the application for  registration  is  refused, the applicant shall be directed to leave  the  Colony,  under the process described in the section.
 SECTION 6: Says that any Asiatic who is the guardian of any Asiatic child under the age of eight years shall upon  making application for registration on his own behalf supply such particulars and furnish such means of identification in respect of such child as may be prescribed by regulation, and if such guardian is himself registered, the particulars aforesaid which he has supplied shall be provisionally noted on the Register, and such guardian shall within one year make application for registration on such child’s behalf at the office of the Resident Magistrate of the district in which he himself resides.
 The section then proceeds to lay down the procedure for the separate registration of such child after he has attained the age of eight years.
 
 SECTION 7: Deals further with the registration of children.
 SECTION 8: Provides that any person who shall fail to make application for registration. . .either on his own behalf or as guardian shall be liable on conviction to a fine not excee-ding One Hundred
 Pounds, and in default of payment to imprisonment with or without hard labour for a period not exceeding three months.
 SECTION 9: Provides that every Asiatic of the age of 16 years and upwards entering or residing in the Transvaal shall upon demand made upon him by any member of the Police Force lawfully established in this Colony, or any other person authorized thereto by the Colonial Secretary, produce  the certificate of registrationlibtech_15_footnotelibtech_16_footnoteof which he is the lawful holder, and shall also on like demand supply such means of identification as may be prescribed by regulation.
 In the case of children under 16 years, the  guardians or parents have to produce a certificate and supply particulars of identification.
 SECTION 10: Makes certificates of registration conclusive evidence as to the right of the lawful holder to remain in the Colony. (N.B. To-day every Asiatic in possession of his permit has such right by law.)
SECTION[S] 11 & 12: Lay down the procedure for lost certificates.
 SECTION 13: Provides that no Asiatic shall obtain a license to trade without production of certificate of registration.
 SECTION 14: Makes the Registrar practically the arbiter as to the age of an Asiatic.
 SECTION 15: Exempts declarations made for the purposes of the Ordinance from stamp duty.
 SECTION 16: Imposes a fine of £500 or in default imprisonment with or without hard labour for a term not exceeding two years, or both fine and imprisonment, for the following acts:
  Any 	fraudulent or 	false statement 	or incitement 	to make 	such statement in 	connection with registration. Forgery 	of registration certificate. 
 
 
  Use of such certificate by a person not the lawful holder. Incitement 	to any 	person to 	use such certificate. 
 
 SECTION 17: Authorizes the issue of temporary permits, and authorizes the Lieutenant-Governor at his discretion to order that any Asiatic in possession of a temporary permit “shall not during the currency of such permit be deemed to be a Coloured person for the purpose of the provision of the Liquor Ordinance”.
 SECTION 18: Gives the Lieutenant-Governor power to frame regulations under the Ordinance.
 SECTION 19: Generally provides that any Asiatic failing to comply with any requirement of the Ordinance shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £100, or in default to imprisonment with or without hard labour for a period not exceeding three months.
 The other Sections provide a heavy penalty for any Asiatic bringing without a permit a child under 16 years of age into the Colony, and among other things cancels [sic] such person’s permit and certificate of registration, and renders him liable to expulsion, and makes it lawful for the heirs of the late Aboo Baker Ahmed to hold a piece of land bought by the late Aboo Baker Ahmed before 1885, and left under his will to the heirs.libtech_17_footnote

I  entirely agree with you in thinking that we have everything to 	gain by all our movements being open to the public, so just, I feel, 	is our cause. If however the meeting  is  not public,  I  should  be 	 at  the Hotel immediately after the interview and if it is not 	inconvenient to you, you may await me at the Hotel after this.

 November 7,1906
 
 THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO
 THE RIGHT HON’BLE THE EARL OF ELGIN
 HIS MAJESTY’S PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES
 COLONIAL OFFICE LONDON
 SIR,
 
 I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to my request for an interview with Lord Elgin on the position of British Indians in Natal. I have no desire to open the whole position, but if His Lordship would be graciously pleased to grant me an interview, I shall be able to show the inner working of the Natal legislation. I was privileged to come into very close contact with the late Sir John Robinsonlibtech_28_footnoteand the late Mr. Harry Escombe, who were the joint authors of the Immigration Restriction Act and the Dealers' Licenses Act. These two, and especially the latter, are the cause of very great and constant irritation. Very serious injustice, in my humble opinion, has often been done in the administration of the Licenses Act.
 I invite His Lordship's attention to the fact that even after the Act was passed, there was a confidential despatch from Mr. Chamberlain to the Natal Ministry as to the operation of the Act. The despatch was partly published, and it stated that unless the municipal bodies exercised the arbitrary powers given to them in virtue of the Licenses Act in a reasonable manner, it might become necessary to amend the Act. I am aware that His Lordship's intervention as to these Acts can only be diplomatic, and it is such intervention I would like to invoke. The object of the interview is to the best of my ability to place the position so before His Lordship as to enlist His Lordship's active
 
 intervention so far as it may be consistent with the traditional policy of the Colonial Office. The new Billlibtech_29_footnoteintroduced by Mr. Ralph Tatham in the Legislative Assembly makes it all the more imperative for me to approach His Lordship.
 I regret exceedingly that the Authority referred to in my letter was not enclosed with it: it was an oversight, for which I beg to be excused. I have now sent it through Mr. Ritch, the Secretary to the Transvaal Deputation. As I have not kept a copy of the Authority, may  I ask you to let me have one.
 I have the honour to remain, Sir,
 Your obedient servant,

 which passed between the Republican Government and the British Government as ‘filthy vermin and persons without souls’. They were then under great disabilities; they could not hold landed property, except in Locations that might be set apart for them for sanitary purposes, and they were required to register themselves and pay a fee  to the Transvaal Government. Lord Derby tried to mitigate their grievances, and Mr. Chamberlain afterwards wrote a strong despatch to the Boer Government  about British Indians, whom he described as honourable men and an asset of great importance to the Transvaal. The result of this was that British Indians went about the country as free citizens, and there was absolutely no restriction upon their  movements. Recently a new Ordinance had been passed and British Indian subjects were classed with Asiatics and were treated in a most degrading manner....

     TO  THE 	RIGHT 	HON’BLE 	THE 	EARL 	OF ELGIN  [Before 	November 8, 1906] 
  HIS 	MAJESTY’S 	PRINCIPAL 	SECRETARY 	OF STATE 	FOR THE COLONIES  COLONIAL 	OFFICE 	LONDON  THE PETITION OF 	THE UNDERSIGNED, RESIDING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, REPRESENTING 	WHOLESALE HOUSES IN SOUTH AFRICA  HUMBLY 	SHEWETH  	That your Petitioners are all London wholesale Shipping Firms and 	Merchants, having branches in, or in connection with, South Africa.  	Most of your Petitioners have come into direct contact with British 	Indian Merchants in South Africa, including the Transvaal.  	From their experience of British Indian Merchants in the Transvaal 	your Petitioners are in a position to state that the British Indian 	Merchants in the Transvaal are on the whole an honest and honourable 	body of men, and their connection with them has always    
 been of a most satisfactory nature.
 In your Petitioners’ opinion their presence in the Transvaal is a distinct gain to the Transvaal community in general. At the very least their presence there tends to the distinct benefit of the Transvaal community by reducing the cost of living expenses to those who can least afford to pay the exorbitantly high prices and profits demanded by the European firms.
 Your Petitioners have read the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, and in your Petitioners’ opinion the Ordinance will submit British Indians in the Transvaal to totally unnecessary indignity and hardship.
 Your Petitioners desire to associate themselves entirely with the sentiments expressed in the Memorial submitted to His Excellency the Governor of the Transvaal by Mr. William Hosken and other notable European residents in the Transvaal in the month of April, 1903.libtech_32_footnote
 In your Petitioners’ humble opinion, while it is desirable that immigration of British Indians should be regulated in order to allay popular prejudice, they think that it should be along the Cape or Natal lines, and should not savour of class distinction.
 Your Petitioners therefore pray that Your Lordship will  be pleased to advise His Majesty to disallow the Ordinance above mentioned, or to grant such relief as will adequately protect the British Indians who have settled in the Transvaal.
 And for this act of justice and mercy, your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.

 November 8, 1906
 
 By the time this is in print Lord Elgin will have received what may be described as a very strong deputation representing all manner of opinion, and including well-known Members  of   Parliament   and
 
 Anglo-Indians of great experience. It is remarkable how the Delegates from the Transvaal have received support and sympathy from all quarters. A most striking illustration perhaps was afforded by the meeting of the Liberal, Labour, and Nationalist Members of the House of Commons at the Grand Committee Room on Wednesday last under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Cotton, the Member for Nottingham East. The attendance was fully one hundred. The Members gave the Delegates a very sympathetic hearing, and many of them showed their active sympathy by making short speeches for or questioning the Delegates. A resolution supporting the objects of the Delegation was unanimously adopted. One of the Members even wanted to know why the Conservative Members had not been invited to the meeting. Sir Charles Dilke, who has consistently championed the cause of British Indians in South Africa, immediately interposed that it was an oversight and that this was a question in which they could certainly secure Conservative co-operation. They and the Liberal Parliament always joined the the Conservatives in securing redress for their Indian fellow-subjects in South Africa.
 Mr. Scott, who was the organizer of the meeting, remarked that the only reason why the Circular Letterlibtech_34_footnotewas confined to the Liberal, Labour, and Nationalist Members was that the Government that was being approached by the Delegates was a Liberal Government, and it was considered only right that the meeting should take the form it did. At the same time they would undoubtedly ask for and be willing to secure the co-operation of Conservative Members.
 Sir Henry Cotton added that on the deputation were represented very staunch Conservatives.
 These proceedings take the question out of party politics, and as Sir Charles Dilke has often said, it becomes a question of Imperial importance. These proceedings ought to strengthen the hands of Lord Elgin and encourage him to veto the Ordinance, or at least to appoint a commission on which the Delegates lay so much stress.
 The Representation submitted to Lord Elgin exhaustively deals with the facts of the case, and shows clearly how unnecessary the legislation is, and how much harder it is than Law 3 of 1885. It is
 
 undoubtedly not an amendment, but a new law, making class distinctions of a very offensive nature. The prayer of the Delegates is very reasonable. They ask Lord Elgin to sanction legislation along the Cape or Natal line[s], leaving it open to British Indian  settlers  to import assistants and such other men as may be required for attention to their businesses. If such legislation be passed it would remove all fear of an unrestricted Asiatic influx. There would then be  no necessity for the espionage contemplated by the Ordinance.
 That the lot of the British Indians is hard enough without any such legislation is shown by a recent prosecution of an Asiatic childlibtech_35_footnoteunder eleven years of age for entering the Colony of the Transvaal in the company of his father. We cannot do better than quote the words of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Transvaal who  quashed the conviction of the child:
 The conviction is wholly bad. Here is a child of between ten and eleven years of age, charged not with an ordinary Common-Law offence, but with the offence of entering the Transvaal by means of a permit improperly obtained. It does appear—at any rate, there is evidence on the record to show—that the thumb-mark of this infant was pressed on a permit belonging to someone else. But this child was not doli capax at all. The child was put into the box, and said he did not know what a permit was, and had never seen one; and I dare say he was speaking the truth. There can be no doubt that the conviction cannot be sustained for one moment.
 The administrative order, of course, still remains. The Magistrate has seriously ordered this infant to leave the Transvaal at the expiration of the term of imprisonment, or upon a certain date, whichever happens sooner. If the child does not go away—and I do not suppose he can go away unless someone takes him—he will then, possibly, be brought up before the Magistrate as a criminal. But I trust that course will not be taken by the authorities. I cannot understand why this case was taken up at all. It is a very important matter. This child is an Indian; but the same would apply to any white child (not one of the exempted classes under the Ordinance) entering the Transvaal; and if it applies to a child of eleven, why not to a child in arms! Surely it was never intended that such an administrative order should be made, in circumstances of this kind. This legislation is sufficiently open to criticism without that. If there is anything which can bring the administration of such a
 
 
 law into ridicule and contempt it is administration conducted on the lines of this case. I trust we shall hear nothing more about the administrative order.
 We had only the other day an example of what The Rand Daily Mail described as “War on Women”libtech_36_footnoteIn the above case, we have an instance of what Indian Opinion describes to be “War on Infants”. Cases such as these call for prompt amelioration, and not for greater severity. The doctrine of relying on men on the spot will be carried to ridiculous extremes if Lord Elgin does not heed the representations made to him on behalf of British Indians in the Transvaal.
 Very strong support is given to the delegation by a personal appeallibtech_37_footnotelibtech_38_footnoteof five British Indians addressed to Lord Elgin in connection with the Ordinance. They are all students from South Africa studying for the Bar or for Medicine, born or brought up in South Africa, and in their words, “South Africa is more our home than India. Even our mother tongue is English, our parents having brought us up to speak that language from our infancy. Three of us are Christians, one a Mahomedan, and one a Hindoo.” Are these men, after they have become barristers or doctors, on their return to South Africa, to be debarred from entering the Transvaal, or are they to carry “tickets of leave” as Sir Henry Cotton described the passes to be issued under the new Ordinance? If such legislation is to be the vogue in the Colonies, it would be a mercy not to allow the British Indians to receive a liberal education in England at all, because a memory of the good times passed by them in England would only enhance the sting of humiliation to be undergone by them in Colonies which are British only in name and un-British in conduct.

  November 8, 1906]libtech_40_footnote  MY 	LORD,    	Mr. Ally, my colleague, and I have to tender our respectful thanks 	to Your Lordship for receiving this  Deputation.  The  task before 	Mr. Ally and myself is, I know, exceedingly delicate and difficult, 	supported though we are by friends who have always helped us in our 	troubles, and representing different schools of politics, and who 	have come to give us the weight of their influence at considerable 	trouble to themselves, especially on a day like this.  	Your Lordship is aware that there was a great Indian Mass Meeting 	held at which resolutions were adopted. The text of these 	resolutions was cabled to Your Lordshiplibtech_41_footnoteand in replylibtech_42_footnoteYour Lordship was pleasedto send a cablegram 	informing the British Indian Asso- ciation that Your Lordship had 	approved of the draft Ordinance in       
 that it gave some measure of relief to British Indians. We, who are on the spot and to whom the Ordinance applies, think, with the greatest deference, that, instead of granting relief, it imposes on British Indians in the Transvaal hardships to which, so far as I am aware, there is no parallel in Colonial legislation. The Ordinance assumes that every Indian is capable of passing his permit to someone else so that he may unlawfully enter the Colony. It, therefore, violates the time-honoured maxim that every one is to be presumed to be innocent until he is found to be guilty. This Ordinance condemns every Indian as guilty and leaves no room for him even to show that he is innocent. It has been called an amendment of Law 3 of 1885. With the greatest respect  I submit that it is no amendment whatsoever of the Law, but that it is a totally new Ordinance accentuating colour prejudice in the most offensive manner. The system of passes that the Ordinance introduces is unknown, so far as British Indians are concerned, in any other part of the British Dominions, and it undoubtedly reduces Indians to a level lower than that of the Kaffirs. The reason for such legislation is said to be that there is a large unauthorized influx of British Indians and that the British Indian community or the British Indian Associa- tion are making an attempt to introduce without authority a large number of Indians into the Colony; in other words, that the community is engaged in a criminal breach of the Peace Preservation Ordinance, and that it is in order to prevent such an attempt that the Ordinance has been passed. It is, therefore, a measure of punishment. One often hears of punitive measures being adopted in connection with communities some members of which have committed grave political crimes or severe breaches of the Common Law of the country. In this instance, the whole community is to be punished in a degrading manner for a crime against a statute restrictive of the liberty of the subject which is misapplied to British Indians, and a crime which the community has stoutly repudiated.
 Such, in the humble opinion of the Indian community, is the Ordinance about which we are approaching Your Lordship. There are three things which are stated to be introduced into the Ordinance in the nature of relief to the British Indians—the remission of the £3 fee; but we have shown that there is no remission at all, as all who are at present in the Transvaal have paid the £3. The second is the authority which is given to the Government by the Ordinance to issue tem- porary permits, but this again is no relief because it is superfluous.
 Such authority has always existed and been exercised at the discretion of the Government: there are today British Indians holding temporary permits.
 There is again the relief to holders of temporary permits from the operation of the Liquor Ordinance. That relief the British Indians never asked for, and so far as it is applicable to them, it is interpreted as a wanton insult.
 There is one thing that the Ordinance undoubtedly rectifies, and that is by restoring [it] to the heirs of the late Aboo Baker Ahmed who held land in his own name before 1885. This is individual  in  character, and I have no doubt that if the price the heirs have to pay for getting land which is theirs by right be the degradation of the whole Indian community of the Transvaal, I am sure that even the heirs themselves would not care to pay it, and the community will certainly never feel in any way thankful for such relief. It will be a most surprising thing if, after repeated promises and pledges, an Ordinance of this nature is countenanced by Your Lordship. I shall venture to quote extracts’ from Mr. Chamberlain’s despatches, also from those of Lord Milner and Mr. Lyttelton, to show what they intended to do after the war. libtech_43_footnote
 It is common knowledge that before the War the British Government used every effort possible that Law 3 of 1885 should be repealed. The condition today is changed, but we had hoped that it would change for the better, seeing that there is  no  foreign government to deal with, but our own Government. Unhappily, we are now in the position of strangers in what may be called our own land. We have always endeavoured to conciliate prejudice and with that view we have made suggestions which have been adopted in the self- governing Colonies. Failing, however, the adoption of these suggestions, we have asked that a commission of enquiry may be appointed. This is the time honoured British custom. Whenever a new step has been taken, a royal commission has preceded it. The latest instance, perhaps, is that of the Aliens Act in the United Kingdom. Before any steps were taken, a commission investigated the charges made against the aliens, and into the question of the adequacy of the existing laws, and into the question as to what new laws were
 necessary. We have asked for a similar commission regarding the British Indians in the Transvaal. We believe that we are entitled to this, in view of the very grave charges I have referred to. We have been asking all these years for bread, but we have received stones in the shape of this Ordinance. We have therefore every reason to hope that Your Lordship will not countenance the legislation above described.

 CONFIDENTIAL	COLONIAL
 OFFICE,
 Thursday, November 8, 1906
 PROCEEDINGS AT A DEPUTATION TO THE RT. HON. THE EARL OF ELGIN ON BRITISH INDIAN SUBJECTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
The deputation consisted of the following gentlemen:
 Lord Stanley of Alderley Mr. H. O. Ally	}
 Mr Gandhi	}	Delegates from [the] Transvaal Sir Lepel Griffin, K.C.S.I.
Mr. J. D. Rees, C.I.E., M.P.
 Sir George Birdwood, K.C.S.I. Sir Henry Cotton, K.C.S.I., M.P. Mr. Naoroji
 Sir M. Bhownaggree, K.C.I.E. Mr. Ameer Ali
 Mr. Harold Cox, M.P. Mr. Thornton, C.S.I.
 THE EARL OF ELGIN: I should just like to say, gentlemen, that I made this interview a private one because I thought, from experience of other meetings of the same sort, we should be better able to discuss the matter friendly across the table without the presence of public reporters; at the same time, I am quite aware that the deputation wish to go into matters of some detail, and therefore I have made arrangements for a note to be taken so that anything which may be said shall be on record.
 Then I should like to say one other word. I recognize among the deputation some of those with whom I have had the pleasure of working in India, and I hope they have explained to the deputation, if it was necessary, that my sentiments would all be in favour of doing anything I could for the interests of British Indians. (‘Hear! Hear!’)
 SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: My Lord, what you have just said makes my duty in
 
 introducing the Delegates more easy. We are very much obliged to your Lordship for admitting this deputation of men who are all known to you as gentlemen connected with India, who have been most of them in India themselves, and are all interested in India, and we are very glad, without any question of party feeling—because all sides are represented in this deputation--to introduce to you the Delegates from South Africa: Mr. Gandhi, who is, as your Lordship is aware, a barrister of the Inner Temple and a man who, in the late Boer war and in the late rising in Natal, has done most excellent work for the country in organizing ambulance corps and in other ways—he practises now in Johannesburg—and Mr. Ally, his colleague, who is  the  representative of the Mohammedan part of the Indian community in the Transvaal, a merchant of very good position and the founder, and I believe the Chairman, of the Islamic Association in the Transvaal. To those gentlemen I propose to leave any details of the Ordinance which has now been passed and which we are about to ask His Majesty’s Government to veto. But I would like to say a few words in explaining the matter now before the Colonial Office, and I shall take up the time of your Lordship only for a few minutes.
 I have been asked to present this deputation principally, I fancy, because I happen to be the Chairman of the Council of the East India Association, of which your Lordship is a distinguished Vice-President, but the question which the East India Association has so often urged upon successive Colonial Secretaries and Secretaries for India and Viceroys of India is not directly concerned in our presence here today. The bed-rock, as your Lordship is aware, of the East India Association’s protests [is] that all well-conducted, loyal, and industrious British subjects, whatever their race or colour, should receive equal rights in all Colonies of the British Empire; that is the bed-rock of justice which has always been refused in the past, but on which the East India Association, which is represented largely here today, begs to continue to rely and from which it must continue to make its protest. That, my Lord, is not precisely the question which this deputation desires to put forward this afternoon; they are not making any of those large claims which we have before made; they only ask that a certain Ordinance applying to the Transvaal alone may not receive the sanction of His Majesty’s Government.
 A few words only are necessary on this point. During the Boer Government the British Indians were treated with considerable harshness, but their immigration into the Transvaal was not prohibited, and with the exception of a fee for a licence for adult traders, they were not interfered with. But their position was an exceedingly uncomfortable one, and many protests were raised which, we understood, when the country fell into the hands of the English, would be redressed. So far from being redressed, their position is made worse and the rules for registration and identification were made exceedingly more rigorous. The Ordinance which has now been passed
 makes, whatever people in South Africa may choose to say, their position infinitely worse and more degrading. It may be said that in the Transvaal these rules are for the benefit of the Indians, but the toad under the harrow knows where the harrow grips him, and the Indians in the Transvaal consider that the new regulations of this Ordinance are a grievance and an insult which is almost too grievous to be borne; and   I for one most strongly support their claim and their protest.
 Under this Ordinance every one in the Transvaal is exposed to the most rigorous investigation; the impressions of his fingers are to be recorded on every pass; no one is allowed in—man, woman or child—without registration of  so  rigorous a character that has been unheard of in any civilized country within my recollection. Under this regulation every Indian in the Transvaal, whether an adult male, whether a woman, or whether a child, and even babes in arms will be obliged to be registered under such conditions as ordinarily apply only to convicts in a civilized country; and evasion or ignorance or even forgetfulness on this point is punished by crushing fines, by imprisonment with hard labour, by expulsion, and by ruin. You, my Lord, who have been Viceroy of India, and whose sympathy is with the country, must know that legislation of this sort is unheard of under the British flag; indeed, today in Europe, I may say without any exaggeration, that, with the exception of the Russian legislation against the Jews, there is no legislation comparable to this on the continent of Europe; and in England, if we wanted a similar case, we should have to go back to the time of the Plantagenets.
 And against whom is this legislation directed? Against the most orderly, honourable, industrious, temperate race in the world, people of our own stock and blood, with whom our own language has as a sister-language been connected. There is no occasion, in the presence of people connected with India, who know its history, to say what the Indian community is today; it is almost an insult to refer to it.
 And by whom is this legislation instigated? I am told, and I believe it, that it  is not by the best part of the British community in the Transvaal, who are, I believe, in favour of giving all reasonable privileges to British Indian subjects; it is by the alien foreign population in the Transvaal who are perhaps to some extent inconvenienced by Indian traders who are so very much more temperate and  industrious than themselves. It does not come from the English. The legislation is prompted, and the prejudice against the Indians is encouraged, by the aliens, by Russian Jews, by Syrians, by German Jews, by every class of aliens, the very off- scourings of the international sewers of Europe. The English residents, against whom  I do not wish to say one word of criticism, are a part, in my mind, of the Transvaal, but the Transvaal is only a Colony by conquest, not by settlement, and it is the aliens who are opposed to this honourable Indian community.
 My Lord, I do not wish to take up more of your time, but what I wish to say is that today we ask you, as representing His Majesty’s Government, and as we know your sympathies are with the Indians, over whom you have ruled with so much distinction, to procure the vetoing of this Ordinance. No large questions are brought before you today by this deputation. They are not asking for political rights; they are not asking for gratitude for their great and devoted services in the Transvaal war where  so many of them lost their lives in their devotion to England, doing as courageous work as any one of the members of the armies which were sent by England, by Australia, or by Canada. Those services have not been recognized; on the contrary, they have been ignored and further burdens have been placed upon them. We ask for nothing today except the merest barest justice. We ask that the whips which the Boers have inflicted upon us may not be changed into scorpions wielded by the British Government.
 I would say in conclusion that we hope everything from the present Government, and for this reason, that the grievances of the Chinese have received the utmost sympathy at the hands of the Government, but, so far as this deputation is concerned, the Chinese and other alien nations do not count. We ask not for the Chinese, but for our own fellow-subjects, and we ask that justice, if not generosity, may be dealt out to them and that your Lordship will save them from insult and oppression.
 It was at your Lordship’s request that this deputation was a small one; it might have been indefinitely extended. This is a test case—a question of going forward or going back. Your Lordship, as a past Viceroy of India, must know that the attention of the whole of India, 300 millions of Indians, is intent today upon the decision which will be given in this test case, and I beg your Lordship to think and to remember that, besides the Indians of Indian birth, against whom the insults of this Ordinance are directed, there are the whole body of Indian officials, to which I and most of the members of this deputation belong, who are insulted with the natives of India. Is it to be supposed that we who have worked with, we who have governed this province of India under your Lordship and under your predecessors and successors, have been governing degraded creatures who are placed lower even than the Zulus and Russian Jews? No, my Lord. We trust to you to do what you can to defend the people whom you have governed so well. And I will beg you to excuse any exciting warmth in my way of speaking, because I assure you that any warmth in my words is very much exceeded by the feeling of shame and resentment which fills my heart at the way  in which the British Indians of the Transvaal are treated today by the settlers (I will not call them Colonists) of that country.
 MR. GANDHI: Both Mr. Ally and I are very much obliged to your Lordship for giving us the opportunity of placing the British Indian position before you. Supported though we are by distinguished Anglo-Indian friends and others, I feel that the task before Mr. Ally and myself is very difficult, because your Lordship, in reply to the cablegramlibtech_46_footnotelibtech_47_footnotesent to you through Lord Selborne, after the great British Indian mass meeting in Johannesburg, was pleased to inform  the British Indian Association, that, although you would be pleased to give us every opportunity of stating our case, no good purpose was likely to be served as your Lordship had approved of the principle of the Ordinance, in that it gave some measure of relief to the British Indian community, though not as much as His Majesty’s Government would desire. We who are the men on the spot and who are affected by the Ordinance in question have ventured to think otherwise. We have felt that this Ordinance does not give us any relief whatsoever. It is a measure which places British Indians in a far worse position than before and makes the lot of the British Indian well-nigh intolerable. Under the Ordinance the British Indian is assumed to be a criminal. If  a stranger, not knowing the circumstances of the Transvaal, were to read the Ordinance, he would have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that an Ordinance of that nature which carries so many penalties and wounds the British Indian community on all sides, must only apply to thieves or a gang of robbers. I venture, therefore, to think that, although Sir Lepel Griffin has used stronglibtech_48_footnotelibtech_49_footnotelanguage  in connection with the Ordinance, he has not at all exaggerated,  but every word of it is justified. At the same time I beg to state that the Ordinance, as amended, does not apply to British Indian females. The draft Ordinance undoubtedly applied to females also, but owing to the very strong protest made by the British Indian Association, and by Mr. Ally separately as Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society, pointing out the great violence that would have been done to female sanctity, if I may say so, the Ordinance was amended so as to take females out of its operation. But it applies to all adult males and even to children, in that the parents or guardians have to take out registra- tion certificates for their children or wards as the case may be.
 
 
 
 It is a fundamental maxim of the British law that every one is presumed to be innocent until he is found guilty, but the Ordinance reverses the process, and brands every Indian as guilty, and leaves no room for him to prove his innocence. There is absolutely nothing proved against us and yet every British Indian, no matter what his status is, is to be condemned as guilty and not treated as an innocent man. My Lord, an Ordinance of this nature [it] is not possible for British Indians to reconcile themselves to. I do not know that such an Ordinance is applicable to free British subjects in any part of His Majesty’s Dominions.
 Moreover, what the Transvaal thinks today the other Colonies think tomorrow.  When  Lord  Milner  sprang  his  Bazaar  Noticelibtech_50_footnotelibtech_51_footnoteon British Indians, the whole of South Africa rang with the Bazaar idea. The term “Bazaar” is a misnomer; it has been really applied to Loca- tions where trade is utterly impossible. However, a proposal was seriously made, after a Bazaar Notice, by the then Mayor of Natallibtech_52_footnotelibtech_53_footnote, Mr. Ellis Browne, that Indians should be relegated to Bazaars. There is not the slightest reason why this Ordinance also, if it ever becomes law, should not be copied by the other parts of South Africa. The position today in Natal is that even indentured Indians are not required to carry passes as contemplated by the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance; nor are there any penalties attached to the non-carrying of passes as are defined in the Ordinance under discussion. We have already shown in our humble representation that no relief has been granted by this Ordinance, because the remission of the £3 fee, referred to by Mr. Duncan, is quite illusory, because all we British Indians resident in the Transvaal who are obliged to pay £3 under Law 3 of 1885, and those who, under Lord Selborne’s promise, are likely to be allowed to re-enter the Transvaal, have paid the £3 already.
 The authority to issue temporary permits is also superfluous in that the Government have already exercised the power, and there are today in the Transvaal several Indians in possession of temporary permits. They are liable to be expelled from the Colony on the expiry of their permits.
 
 The relief under the Liquor Ordinancelibtech_54_footnoteis, British Indians feel, a wanton insult. So much was this recognized by the local Government that they immediately assured the Indians that it was not intended for British Indians at all, but for somebody else. We have no connection with anybody else, and we have always endeavoured to show that the British Indians ought to be treated as British subjects, and ought not to be included with the general body of Asiatics with respect to whom there may be a need for some restrictions which ought not to apply to British Indians as British subjects.
 There remains one more statement that is in connection with the land owned by the late Aboobaker.libtech_55_footnotelibtech_56_footnoteThat land should belong to the heirs by right, but under the interpretation reluctantly put upon it by the Supreme Court, that it is only individual in character and does not touch the community, the land cannot be transmitted to the heirs. The Ordinance is intended to rectify the error, but, as I had the honour to represent the heirs, I ventured to think that even they  would  not consent to pay for getting this relief at the price, in the nature of this Ordinance, for British Indians; and certainly the Indian community can never exchange for the relief given to their heirs of the land of Aboobaker an Ordinance of this nature, which requires them to pay so great a price for what is really their own. So that under the Ordinance in that respect again there is absolutely no relief. As I said before, we shall be, under the Ordinance, branded as criminals.
 My Lord, the existing regulation is severe enough. I hold in my hands returns from the Court of the Magistrate at Volksrust. Over 150 successful prosecutions of Indians attempting to enter the Transvaal have taken place during the years 1905 and 1906. All these prosecutions, I venture to say, are by no means just. I venture to believe that if these prosecutions were gone into you would see that some of them were absolutely groundless.
 So far as the question of identification is concerned the present laws are quite enough. I produce to your Lordship the registration certificate held by me, and it will show how complete it is to establish identification. The present law can hardly be called an amendment. I produce before your Lordship a registration receipt held by my
 
 
 colleague, Mr. Ally, from the Transvaal Government. Your Lordship will see that it is merely a receipt for £3. The registration under the present Ordinance is of a different type. When Lord Milner wished to enforce Law 3 of 1885 he suggested new registration. We protested against it, but on his strong advice, as a voluntary act, we allowed ourselves to be newly registered, and hence the form produced before your Lordship. At the time that registration was undertaken, Lord Milner stated emphatically that it was a measure once for all, and that it would form a complete title to residence by those who held such registration certificates. Is all this now to be undone? Your Lordship is doubtless aware of the Punia caselibtech_57_footnotelibtech_58_footnote, wherein a poor Indian woman, in company with her husband, was torn away from her husband, and was ordered by the magistrate to leave the country within seven hours. Fortunately, relief was granted in the end, as the matter was taken up in time. A boy under 11 years was also arrested and sentenced to pay a fine of £50 or to go to gaol for three months, and at the end of it to leave the country. In this case again the Supreme Court has been able to grant justice. The conviction was pronounced to be wholly bad, and Sir James Rose-Innes stated that the Administration would bring itself to ridicule and contempt if such a policy was pursued.libtech_59_footnotelibtech_60_footnoteIf the existing legislation is strong enough and severe enough to thus prosecute British Indians, is it not enough to keep out of the Colony British Indians who may attempt fraudulently to enter it?
 It has been stated that the reason for passing the Ordinance is that there is an unauthorized influx of British Indians into the Transvaal on a wholesale scale, and that there is an attempt on the part of the Indian community to introduce Indians in such a manner. The last charge has been, times without number, repudiated by the Indian community, and the makers of the charge have been challenged to prove their statement. The first statement has also been denied.
 I ought to mention one thing also, that is, the fourth resolution that was passed at the British Indian mass meeting.libtech_61_footnoteIt was passed by the meeting solemnly, prayerfully, and in all humility, and the whole of that great meeting decided by that resolution that, if this Ordinance
 
 
 ever came to be enforced, and we did not get relief, the British Indians, rather than submit to the great degradation involved in it, would go to gaol; such was the intensity of the feeling aroused by the Ordinance. We have hitherto suffered much in the Transvaal and in other parts of South Africa, but the hardship has been tolerable; we have not considered it necessary to travel 6,000 miles to place the position before the Imperial Government. But the straining point has been reached by the Ordinance, and we felt that we should in all humility exhaust every resource even to the extent of sending a Deputation to wait on your Lordship.
 The least, therefore, that in my humble opinion is due to the British Indian community is to appoint a commission as suggested in the humble representation submitted to your Lordship. It is a time- honoured British custom that, whenever an important principle is involved, a commission is appointed before a step is taken. The question of alien immigration into the United Kingdom is a parallel case. Charges somewhat similar to the charges against the Indian community were made against the aliens who entered the United Kingdom. There was also the question of the adequacy of the existing legislation and the necessity for further legislation; all these three points were referred to a commission before any step was taken. I, therefore, venture to think that a commission should be appointed, and the whole question thrashed out before any drastic measures are taken.
 I venture, therefore, to hope that your Lordship will see your way to grant this small measure of relief to the British Indian community.
 MR. H. O. ALLY: My Lord, we are very much obliged to you for the patient hearing your Lordship is giving to the deputation. Mr. Gandhi has stated the case fully before your Lordship, and I do not wish to add much to what has already been said. I am not a lawyer, but as a layman, and as a resident of old standing in the Transvaal, I do wish to submit to your Lordship that the hardships that the present Ordinance would inflict upon us are unbearable. And I can assure your Lordship that, immediately the Ordinance was introduced into the Legislative Council of the Transvaal, my fellow-countrymen felt, and felt very keenly, to think that such laws can be passed under a British Government. It is what I should never have believed years ago.
 Our lot is today infinitely worse than under the Boer regime; we were able to
 get protection from the British Government during that time. Are we now, under the same Government, to be persecuted?
 When aliens of all classes are, at the very moment that the Ordinance is introduced, pouring into the Transvaal, and when they enjoy all the rights and privileges granted to British subjects, my countrymen, who are always to the fore for the defence of the Empire, are suffering these serious disabilities and the disabilities threatened by the Ordinance. Today in India the frontier is guarded by my fellow- countrymen, who shoulder the rifle in defence of the Empire; and it is very grievous that they should have to suffer such misery, and that there should be class legislation against them of this type.
 I appeal for justice, and I appeal to your Lordship in the name of the British traditions, that you will be pleased to remove the disability that the Ordinance will place upon us, by vetoing it, or at least by granting a commission. We are loyal British subjects, and as such we are entitled to the fullest protection. We have not asked for, and we do not now ask for, political rights: we are content that the white man should be predominant in the Transvaal; but we do feel that we are entitled to all the other ordinary rights that a British subject should enjoy.
 SIR HENRY COTTON: I wish to say one word, my Lord, if I may. I am here not only as a retired Indian official, like many distinguished men I see around me, but also   as a Member of the present Parliament, and as chairman of a meeting which sat in the Grand Committee Room upstairs in the House of Commons attended by more than 100 members of the Liberal Party. I take this opportunity of saying that I deeply regret that the invitations to attend that meeting were not extended to both sides of the House. (‘Hear! Hear!’) It was an unfortunate oversight which we all regret. But that meeting, I say, was attended by 100 and more Members of the House of Commons, and their feeling was very strong indeed upon this subject; indeed, they went so far as to record a resolution that they sympathized with and supported the prayer of the petitioners. Since that meeting, my Lord, I have been brought in contact with many Members of the House of Commons who were not present at the meeting, gentlemen on both sides of the House. Many gentlemen on the opposite benches have also intimated to me that there is a complete sympathy with the attitude taken up by Messrs Gandhi and Ally on behalf of their fellow-subjects in the Transvaal.
 I wish also in associating myself, as I do completely, with the observations which fell from Sir Lepel Griffin, to remind your Lordship that it  was  Lord Lansdowne, for whom we all have the greatest regard and respect, who, although he is the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords, is at all events, as we know very well, a most liberal-minded statesman, who drew prominent attention in England to
 the grievances which the British Indians in the Transvaal suffered  from  under President Kruger’s administration. Nothing, he said, roused so much indignation in his mind or so much anger as the ill-treatment which the British Indians received in South Africa. And he went further even in his speech—it was a speech delivered at Sheffield two or three weeks after the outbreak of the war—for he said that he regarded with grave anxiety the state of feeling which must inevitably exist in India when it was known that the British subjects of India in South Africa were so ill treated and ground down. And he pointed out the imperative duty of the British Government to improve their status and position.
 Now, my Lord, that is a pledge which was given by the head of the Opposition in the House of Lords, and I appeal to you, my Lord, as the representative of a Liberal Government, in dealing with this matter in South Africa, that your duty is at least as decisive as [that] Lord Lansdowne claimed for himself a few years ago.
 It is true that the people of India do feel this matter very deeply. It is true also that the British Indians in South Africa have greater grievances to complain of now than they had under the Dutch Government; and the climax has been reached in the passing of this Ordinance, of which Messrs Gandhi and Ally here so justly complain. Representing as I do a very influential and large section of the House of Commons and, I believe, the almost unanimous official feeling in India on the subject, I do trust that your Lordship will be able to give this petition your favourable consideration.
 SIR M. M. BHOWNAGGREE: My Lord, I think the case has been so ably and clearly put before your Lordship that there is not the least occasion for me to go into any details, and if I feel called upon to address your Lordship for a very few minutes, it  is simply on account of the interest I took in this question all through my ten and a half years’ career in Parliament. I want to bring to your Lordship’s notice a few points which perhaps may not be within your knowledge.
 In complaining of the grievances of British Indian subject in South Africa, I had opportunities of seeing your predecessors, Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Lyttelton, very often on the subject. My activity had taken the form at last of a long printed letter in which I detailed the whole narrative of the facts, and Mr. Lyttelton thereupon assured me that the case had been so fairly put, and the demands made were so reasonable, that he hoped to get some relief. I, on the other hand, knew what the local forces of opposition to a liberal policy on the part of any ministry of the Imperial Government would be, and while I thanked him for his sympathetic answer, I told him it might be necessary to appoint a commission to enquire into the whole subject. Sir George Farrar, who represented the anti British Indian interest[s] in the Transvaal legislature, also happened at the same time, to suggest that the appointment of a
 commission would ventilate the matter, and might bring some solution of that very difficult problem. Thereupon I addressed Mr. Lyttelton again, accepting Sir George Farrar’s offer, and matters were in that train, and I believe Mr. Lyttelton would have ultimately appointed a commission, but the Government, of which he was a member then, went out of office. Recognizing the very difficult position in which the whole question stands, I now urge that a commission might be appointed pending the report of which this Ordinance might at least be held in abeyance, so that you may have the benefit of judging of the whole question by the report of that commission.
 I have only one word to add, my Lord. For five years your Lordship has been the custodian and guardian of Indian interests and the protector of their rights, during  a memorable and distinguished viceroyalty. Today—as our leader, Sir Lepel Griffin, has well said—the eyes of all India are focused upon the proceedings which are taking place in this room, and I am only expressing the sentiments of the 300 millions of people of India when I express the hope that your Lordship will, on account of the sympathy which you have shown, and which I believe you are ready to show, and of which, even on our entrance into this room, you assured us, allow no other consideration but that of justice to weigh with you, and will grant the prayer which these gentlemen have come all this long distance here to ask at your hands.
 MR. REES: I am not going, my Lord, into the subject of the merits of the case; I think they were amply dealt with by Sir Lepel Griffin; nor am I going to speak of my interest in this subject, which I have often brought before Parliament myself. But when Sir Henry Cotton spoke of the meeting yesterday, I should like to say that it was not only a party meeting, but it was a meeting of part of a party, and that I do deprecate with all my heart and soul, in a matter which is of such serious importance, any endeavour to make any subject connected with British India a party subject. I do not think there can be a more serious matter than this very serious one upon which we have come before your Lordship, namely, the unfortunate manner in which our fellow- subjects have been treated in the Transvaal.
 MR. HAROLD COX: My Lord, I am in a somewhat different position from most of the gentlemen here, because I am neither an ex-official of the Government of India, nor am I myself Indian by birth, but I did have the honour personally of serving in India for two years under a Native Prince, and I look back to that period of my life with the greatest pleasure. That is one special reason why I am here today. But at the back of my mind the real reason why I am here today is because I am English, and because I think this matter is a disgrace to my country. Our country was pledged when  we went to war with the Transvaal to do justice to the British Indians. That justice has not been done, and I contend that it is not possible for the present Government, of
 which your Lordship is a part, to ride off on the plea that the Transvaal is a self- governing Colony. It is not a self-governing Colony. It is absolutely subject to your authority, and whatever is done by you today, or at any other time, is done not in the name of the Transvaal, but in the name of the English people, and in the name of the English people I protest against any injustice being done to British subjects.
 MR. NAOROJI: I  do  not  want  to  take  up  your  Lordship’s  time,  and  after  the able manner in which the whole subject has been laid before you, I would only join in the appeal that has been made to you on behalf of my fellow-subjects under the British flag. If there is one principle more important than another, it is that of the freedom of British subjects under the British flag, and I do hope that the British Government, especially a Liberal Government, will stand upon that basis.
 MR. AMEER ALI: Will your Lordship allow me to make one observation only? Perhaps my recent experience of India is the most recent of all. I venture to say this: that the feeling of India is very strong on this subject of the injury done to British Indians in the Transvaal, and it will be a serious mistake if the subject is put on one side. That is the only matter I want to present to your Lordship.
 THE EARL OF ELGIN: In the first place, I would like to say that I entirely accept the position which Mr. Cox put upon me. I am responsible, no doubt, for the advice which is given in this matter and nobody else, and I do not wish to shirk my responsibility. In the second case, I wish also to express my adherence to what was said by Mr. Rees, Sir Henry Cotton and others that I regard this as no party question  at all. Sir Henry Cotton quoted from Lord Lansdowne, but I have before me a despatch from the Colonial Secretary of the last Government from which I should like to read one paragraph: ‘His Majesty's Government cannot believe that the British community in the Transvaal appreciate the true nature of the proposition which some of its members are pressing upon you. They, as Britons, are as jealous of the honour of the British name as ourselves, and even if a material sacrifice were necessary to vindicate that honour, I feel assured they would cheerfully make it. His Majesty's Government hold that it is derogatory to national honour to impose on resident British subjects disabilities against which we had remonstrated, and to which even the law of the late South African Republic rightly interpreted did not subject them, and they do not doubt that when this is perceived the public opinion of the Colony will not any longer support the demand which has been put forward.’
 SIR HENRY COTTON: May I ask which Colonial Secretary that was?
 THE EARL OF ELGIN: It was from Mr. Lyttelton to yourself, written in 1904. Now, I understand from the gentlemen who have come before me today that we are not here to discuss general sympathies, nor even are we to consider anything further than the rights which the British Indian community possessed in the past. They do not ask
 at this present moment for an extension of those rights. That limits the matter, as I think you wish it to be limited, to the question of this Ordinance itself.
 SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: For the present, my Lord. We are going to fight the question hereafter.
 THE EARL OF ELGIN: Oh, yes; I am thinking of today, and the answer I have to
  give.    SIR 	LEPEL 	GRIFFIN: 	Yes.  THE 	EARL 	OF ELGIN: 	I only make that observation in order that I may be precise 
  in 	my answer. The question, therefore, is with reference to this 	Ordinance, and following up the remark I made just now about its 	being no party question, I hope you will accept it from me that it 	was no intention of the men at the head of the Transvaal 	Government—they distinctly stated so to me—that they had no 	intention whatever in the legislation they brought forward to do 	otherwise than to improve, rather than to make worse, the condition 	of the British Indian community. I am not saying that the subject is 	not perfectly open to your criticisms, but I wish you to accept from 	me that that was the intention with which this legislation was 	brought forward.  Now 	Mr. Gandhi explained 	that, in some 	cases, for instance 	in the 	case of 	the poll-tax, this 	concession, which was 	supposed to 	be given under the 	Ordinance, was 	illusory. I 	admit that 	I think 	there was something 	in his 	statement that 	most of those 	who would come under the 	restriction I have just mentioned would probably have paid the 	£3. But at the 	same time, dealing with 	this as a 	matter of 	the status 	of the 	British Indians 	in the 	Transvaal, I 	conceive that the 	Government might quite 	fairly have held that 	in removing 	the imposition 	of the 	poll-tax once 	for all they 	were, pro tanto, 	improving the 	status of 	the British Indians.  Then 	with regard to 	the question 	of permits 	or registration, 	we have 	seen one of 	the permits 	given under the Boer 	administration. It 	is merely a 	receipt for 	the money. 	The Boer 	administration in 	that respect, 	as well 	as in a 	good many others, 	was not so 	accurate as 	the administration 	which necessarily 	with our ideas obtains 	under the British 	Government; and, 	therefore, I 	am only 	stating the 	view which has been 	put before 	me; the view 	of the 	Government of 	the Transvaal 	is this: 	that as it 	stood under the 	rules of 	the Boer 	Government which 	they had inherited, 	there was 	great confusion, 	and there were great 	administrative 	difficulties,  and 	 that consequently 	there was a considerable 	degree of friction, 	and also 	there arose 	considerable delay in 	the determination 	of cases 	of which 	1 see 	traces in 	the petition 	itself. It 	was for that purpose, as 	I understand it, 	that the 	Government of 	the Transvaal proposed to 	substitute the 	form of 	registration, but 	according to 	their representations 	to me, 	there was 	no intention 	whatever of making 	that form of registration 	in any 	way more 	oppressive than the form 	of permits properly 	ministered. 
 And if I may, just for a moment—I do not want to go into all the details— follow this question of thumb marks, I think that thumb marks first came into notice prominently when Sir Henry Cotton and I were associated in the Government of India, under our friend Mr. Henry, who occupies a prominent position in the city now. No doubt the imposition of thumb marks was introduced in that case for the detection of criminals, but I do not know why the imposition of a thumb mark in itself should be a very debasing operation; in fact, as they say, it has always seemed to me a most marvellous thing that they say whey can trace every thumb mark, there might be an advantage over the hieroglyphics which some of us call our signatures. And there is this fact I want just to mention, and to bring to the notice of Mr. Gandhi, that on the permit which he has handed to me, issued under the present Ordinance, there is a thumb mark already imposed under the present Ordinance in just the same way as it will be imposed under the new Ordinance.
 MR. GANDHI: Only that that, as I said, is a purely voluntary act done by us on the advice and the instigation of Lord Milner. He asked us to do it.
 THE EARL OF ELGIN: Quite so; but still here is a certificate which is an official certificate, and it bears a thumb mark.
 LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY: It was affixed without prejudice.
 THE EARL OF ELGIN: I do not see why it should not be affixed to the registration certificate without prejudice.
 SIR M. BHOWNAGGREE: Might I explain one thing? Whatever Lord Milner asked British Indians to do was done on the understanding that the whole question of the treatment of the community was the subject of  consideration between  the Colonial Secretary for the time being and Lord Milner and the local authorities, so that they might have submitted to Lord Milner’s injunction in a respectful way and, as Lord Stanley just now said, without prejudice. But this imposes a sort of distinction between one subject and another in the Transvaal.
 THE EARL OF ELGIN:: Do not suppose I am taking it further than this; I am only saying here is a document which is at present in use with a thumb mark, and it cannot be called debasing.
MR. GANDHI: It is the ten-finger mark.
 THE EARL OF ELGIN:: Is it more debasing with ten fingers?
 SIR HENRY COTTON: It is only required in the case of criminals.
 THE EARL OF ELGIN:: I do not want to argue it, but I think there is just that much to be said.
 Then there is one matter about registration; that is, that if the system of
 registration was carried out it would give a final and indefeasible title to those who are registered to their rights in the Transvaal. That is the position of the Transvaal Government on that matter. And as regards the carrying of a pass, and any oppressive use of the power of inspection, I am informed, and I have taken some trouble to ascertain it, that all that would be intended, so far as checking the  Ordinance certificate is concerned, is that it would probably be inspected once a year. As regards any other casual demand for it, it would be, as I am told, exactly in the same position as this permit is, which, if I am right, may be demanded from anybody in the Transvaal. This is the position. I do not want to elaborate too much on this subject, I only wish to make this explanation, that those were the sort of reasons which the Government of the Transvaal put before me when they asked my assent to the introduction of the legislation on these grounds, and it is distinctly upon my apprehension that these modifications of the law would, in the long run, be for the benefit, and not for the oppression, of the British Indian community that I gave my assent to the introduction of that legislation.
 Now, gentlemen, we are in the position that this is challenged. I think I ought to say, without in any way challenging the authority with which Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Ally come here as the representatives of a large meeting, that I have got telegrams from the Transvaal advising me of the forwarding of a petition from British Indians which they say had been largely signed, in opposition to the views which have been placed before me today; and with regard to the general feeling I have today received two more telegrams, I say two more, because there are a good many others from different municipalities in the country urging the passing of the Ordinance and so on.  I cannot, therefore, entirely subscribe to what Sir Lepel Griffin said about the opposition, and the nature of the opposition to this matter. I regret it more than anybody in this room. I suppose there could be found, if not in the records of this office, at any rate, in the records of the India Office, despatches with my signature attached to them, protesting, in as strong language as has been used here, against the restrictions on British citizens, and I do not go back from one single word. But we have to recognize the fact that all over the world there are difficulties arising on the part of white communities, and we have to reckon with them. I do not say that they ought always to succeed; they certainly ought not to succeed in points of detail which would, in any way, involve oppression. But the fact of there being that sentiment has to be borne in mind when we have to deal with matters of this description.
 I do not think I have much more to reply to. Reference has been made to the proposition towards the end of the petition, that at any rate there might be a postponement for the examination of the subject by a commission. That, no doubt, is an alternative which might be adopted; but I am not in a position today to say
 whether that is so or not. Indeed I think you will easily acknowledge that I paid you the best compliment when I did not endeavour to make up my mind until I had seen you, and heard what you have to say. That is my position. I have now heard what Mr. Gandhi had to say. I hope he has put before me, as fully as he desired, what he has come so far to say. I have heard the other gentlemen who have accompanied him. I will give the best consideration to their representations, and I shall think it my duty  to make up my mind with the full responsibility which I have to assume.
MR. GANDHI: May I make one statement, my Lord, for one
 minute? I have listened with the very greatest attention, and with very great obligation, to your Lordship’s statement, but I must submit that the information placed before your Lordship on some points is not accurate, and I am in a position to refute that information by documentary evidence with regard to permits, as your Lordship used the term, in connection with the Ordinance of 1885, but this is not the occasion when I could do it. But if your Lordship will ask us to wait upon you we: will do it. But that just shows that nothing short of a commission would place our position accurately before  your Lordship.
 SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: My Lord, I beg, on behalf of the deputation, to express our best thanks for the exceedingly kind and courteous way in which you have received us, and the patience with which you have listened to what we had to say. We were assured before of your full sympathy in this matter, and knew it perfectly well.
 (The deputation then withdrew.)

 COLONIAL OFFICE LONDON
 SIR,
 With reference to the interview that Lord Elgin was pleased to grant us, we beg to enquire whether His Lordship will be pleased to
 acquaint us with the nature of the cablegramlibtech_62_footnoteof dissent received from some Indians in the Transvaal by His Lordship, as also with the names of the senderslibtech_63_footnote. The information is of a somewhat startling nature and we might, if some further information were given to us, be able to render an explanation.
 The Deputation this afternoon was intended more to strengthen His Lordship’s hands in securing for the British Indians in the Transvaal fair and just treatment rather than to place before His Lordship a full statement. As we believe that some of the information received by His Lordship and used by him in his statement is not consistent withthe facts, may we request a brief private interview at which it will be possible for us to place the details more fully before him than we could at the Deputation that took place this afternoon.
 We have the honour to remain, Sir,
 Your obedient servants,

We venture to address this informal letter to you on the strength
  	of your having always been a friend of the Coloured people, using 	the term in its widest sense. Lord Elgin seemed to think, as you 	also thought, that a commission of enquiry was due to us. We venture 	respectfully to think that a word of approval from you of the idea 	of a commission would bring about, from our point of view, the 	desired result. The Ordinance proceeds on the assumption that every 	Indian is capable of abusing his permit or registration. From the  	statement  made by Lord Elgin there is, in our humble opinion, no 	doubt that a great deal of inaccurate information has been placed 	before him. We think that nothing short of an impartial commission 	of enquiry can remove all the doubts and misapprehension that exist.

POLAK,    	I am sending you all the cuttings I can. I will not enumerate them. 	The interview with Lord Elgin yesterday was exceedingly good. Sir 	Lepel Griffin spoke very nicely. You may read this letter to the 	members of the Association. I may be able to let you have the 	official copy of the proceedings next week. I have applied for it. 	Sir Muncherji, Mr. Naoroji, Mr. Ameer Ali and Mr. Rees spoke; they 	were all precise and to the point. The support we have received is 	beyond expectation. Everybody considers that a stronger deputation  	on  Indian affairs has never yet waited upon the Government. There 	seems to be every reason for hoping that Lord Elgin will grant a 	commission and if he does, it will be exceedingly good. We have now 	asked for an interview with Mr. Morley; that Deputation will also, I 	believe, be very 
 strongly supported The meeting of the Members of the House of Commonslibtech_69_footnotewas   very   enthusiastic   and   sympathetic.   Some   of   the Members thought that it was unprecedented ! Nobody had expected that over 100 Members would attend. The speakers too at the meeting vied with one another in showing their sympathy.
 We saw Lord George Hamilton today: he gave us half an hour. He said he felt convinced that an injustice was being done. He has promised to study the Representation to Lord Elgin. There was, however, an attitude of non possumus about him.
 We sent you a long cablegramlibtech_70_footnoteyesterday. The more we see, the more we feel that a permanent committee is absolutely necessary, if the work of the Deputation is not to be frittered away. Sir Muncherji is very emphatic on the point. It is, therefore, vexing that no cablegram has yet been received from you. This is not to blame you. I can quite understand the difficulties you are going through. This is not to blame you.libtech_71_footnoteI simply state the fact that delay is dangerous and hope that tomorrow there will be a cablegram from you. I need hardly say that Mr. Ally is in thorough agreement with this view. We are both getting on very nicely.
 You will be pleased to learn that Mr. Scott, your father’s friend, played an important part in bringing about the meeting of the Members of the House of Commons and that your father devoted the best part of last Monday to seeing Mr. Scott and others for this meeting. His assistance to me has been very valuable in more ways than one. Your mother has promised to try earth bandages for her neuralgia. I tried to dig up some clean earth from your yard but it was not to be had. Your father was to procure some from elsewhere. I shall know more next Sunday as I am to pass almost the whole of Sunday afternoon with your people: having, however, found out Mrs. [Freeth’s address,]libtech_72_footnotelibtech_73_footnoteI shall have to take away 2 hours from them.
 I am not sending any article this time; I may write something if the spirit moves me. My outside activity has been so great that there has not been much time left for contemplation: anything, therefore, that I should give you would be purely superficial. You may, however,
 
 give an article on the papers regarding the activity of the Deputation which I am sending. Mr. Mukerji will send you some cuttings and you may deal with the Representation by Godfrey and others, as also the House of Commons meeting and the Deputation. As I am dictating this, I now fancy that I may give you a leaderlibtech_74_footnoteon Lord Elgin’s reply to clear away some of the points.
 You should not take anything from this letter about the Deputation to work up an article because the proceedings of the deputation are supposed to be [private]libtech_75_footnote. The cablegram sent to Lord Elgin must be shocking!!! I suppose it is Dr. Godfrey. We have asked Lord Elgin to give us the text of the cablegram and the name of the sender. We may then give an explanation.

  November 9, 1906libtech_77_footnote  INTERVIEW 	WITH 	LORD 	ELGIN  	Though in order of time, the interview with Lord Elgin comes last, I 	shall deal with it first as it is very important. We were 	accompanied by Sir Lepel Griffin, Lord Stanley of Alderley, Sir 	Muncherji Bhownaggree, Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, Mr. Syed Ameer Ali, Mr. 	Harold Cox, Sir, Henry Cotton, Sir George Birdwood, Mr. J. D. Rees, 	Mr. Thornton and Mr. F. H. Brownlibtech_78_footnote. The deputation included members from all the 	parties.libtech_79_footnoteIt 	is said that such a [strong] deputation has never before waited on 	Lord Elgin. We all presented ourselves before Lord Elgin at 3 p.m. 	on Thursdaylibtech_80_footnote.       
 Sir Lepel Griffin made a spirited speech and appealed to Lord Elgin to reject the Ordinance. file said that the Ordinance was derogatory to Anglo-Indianslibtech_81_footnotelibtech_82_footnote. One who read   the  Ordinance  would think that those who ruled over such peoplelibtech_83_footnotelibtech_84_footnotemust be a worthless lot. The Indians and the British both originated in Central Asia.  The Indians were very industrious, intelligent and honest. Those who had seen India would never tolerate the refuse of Europe collected in the Transvaal tyrannizing over the Indians there.
 Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Ally spoke after Sir Lepel. Mr. Ally’s voice choked with emotion as he spoke.
 Then Sir Henry Cotton made a powerful speech. Quoting Lord Lansdowne, he said that the Members of the House of Commons also wanted that justice be done. While Kruger used the whip, the British Government were scourging us with scorpion stings. Sir Muncherji wanted to know what had happened to the commission which Mr. Lyttelton had promised him. If Lord Elgin could do nothing more, the commission at any rate should be appointed. Mr. Ameer Ali said that he had recently returned from India and that the whole country was unhappy over the sufferings of Indians in South Africa.
 Mr. Dadabhai said that the British Government would stand disgraced if the oppression of Indians continued.
Mr. Rees said that this question was an all-party one.
 Mr. Cox said that, as an Englishman, he felt ashamed of the disabilities Indians in the Transvaal had to suffer.
 In reply, Lord Elgin said that his own sympathy was bound to be with the Indians. He had always wished well of the Indian people. The officials of the Transvaal Government had stated that the Ordinance was not oppressive. It was true in a sense that the remission of the £3 tax afforded, as Mr. Gandhi had pointed out, no relief in fact. However, it was something of a gain that the legal stigma of the
 £3 tax had been removed. There did not seem to be much objection to the giving of thumb-impressions. It was unlikely that the police would look into the passes every day and harass the people. However, there was no need to emphasize all these matters. Sir Lepel had said that the
 
 British whites there were not very hostile to Indians. But there were cablegrams from Krugersdorp and other places which expressed the hope that the Ordinance would receive Royal assent. While he would not say anything about Mr. Gandhi or Mr. Ally, he might tell them that he had received cablegrams from some Indians expressing contrary opinions. He added that all that was by way of information only. He did not regard the demand for a commission as unreason- able. The matter deserved consideration, and he would reply after giving it sufficient thought.
 Seeking permission to speak for a minute, Mr. Gandhi said that Lord Elgin’s information was not correct and that, if His Lordship gave them another appointment, the two Delegates would be able to prove this. Whether or not a second meeting materializes, all this clearly shows that the appointment of a commission is absolutely necessary and that such complicated matters can be settled only through a commission.
 It is hoped that, as a result of this Deputation, a commission will be appointed.
 MEMBERS OF HOUSE OF COMMONS
 As we thought it would be very appropriate and helpful if the Members of the House of Commons met and passed a resolution expressing sympathy, we called upon some Members and had a discussion with them. In this matter we sought the help of Mr. Sootielibtech_85_footnotea Member of Parliament who is a friend of Mr. Polak’s father, and the meeting at last took place on Wednesday night. Some half-a-dozen Members jointly issued a circular and invitations. Messrs Gandhi and Ally spoke and then the meeting passed a resolution requesting Lord Elgin to accede to the demand of the Indian Deputation. Many people think that the large meeting of Members of the House of Commons was the first of its kind in recent times. This shows that our cause is being widely discussed.
 MEETING WITH AMEER ALI
 Both the members of the Deputation had a private interview with Mr. Ameer Ali, during which he expressed much sympathy for our
 
 cause and also promised to write on it, if possible, for prominent papers here.
 INTERVIEW WITH LORD HAMILTON
 Lord George Hamilton heard us patiently for half an hour. It will be recalled that he was at one time the Secretary of State for India. He has agreed to go into the question fully and do his best.
 This matter is often discussed in South Africa and other papers. South Africa also published an interviewlibtech_86_footnotewith  Mr.  Gandhi  on  Mr. Tatham’s Bill. The correspondent has given a correct report of the interview.
 A copy of the petition submitted to Lord Elgin has been sent to every Member of Parliament with a courteous covering letter.
 A  letterlibtech_87_footnotelibtech_88_footnoteseeking   an   interview   with   Mr.   Morley   has   been despatched today. It will probably materialize next week. The Deputa- tion has still so much work to do that it will be very difficult for it to leave on November 24.
 SOUTH AFRICAN STUDENTS IN ENGLAND
 A petition has been specially sent to Lord Elgin by these students.libtech_89_footnotelibtech_90_footnoteIn it they have asked to know what their own plight would be under the new law; but the petition covers the question of the rights of all the others as well. If Lord Elgin should say that separate laws would be made for those who had gone to England, he would be insulting the others; if, on the other hand, he should say that they would not get the rights, it would be gross injustice.
 NATAL QUESTION
 The Deputation is not concerned with Natal affairs. However, since Mr. Tatham’s Bill has been published and a cablegram about it has been received here, Mr. Gandhi has asked for a private interview with Lord Elgin.libtech_91_footnoteHe has not yet given a definite reply, but has written saying that he will do so next week.

      DEAR 	SIR HENRY,  November 	10, 1906 
  	You may have seen The Times’ report of the interview. In my 	opinion whoever gave the information, it was a shameful thing. Sir 	Lepel was very much annoyed about it, when I saw him yesterday.  	Three reporters carne to me on Thursday evening, and I replied that 	I could not possibly give them any information, as Lord Elgin wanted 	the interview to be treated as strictly private.  	Mr. Adam of Reuter’s Agency has just come over to enquire whether 	any [member] of the deputation could have supplied The    
 Times with the report. I have assured him that such a thing is not possible.
 Sir Lepel is of opinion that the information must have been given by someone in the Colonial Office. Lord Elgin’s speech has been given practically word for word.
 Mr. Adam su ggests, and I entirely agree, that there should be a questionlibtech_93_footnotelibtech_94_footnotein the House enquiring why it was that  The Times was so favoured."

 By your leading article in The Times of the 10th instant on the British Indian question in the Colonies, you have lifted it from the platform of parochialism to that of Imperialism. For the present, however, we will be thankful if you will allow us to deal with the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance without touching the larger issue discussed by you.
You say:
 It does not seem likely or desirable that a measure, which appears to be supported generally by the opinion of the people who are shortly to have power to make their own laws, should be refused the assent of the Crown.
We venture to take exception to your opinion for the following
reasons:
  You 	admit that 	upon the merits of 	the particular 	controversy aroused by the Ordinance there is “at present hardly evidence 
 
 enough to form judgement”.
  The 	Ordinance does 	not affect the 	broad question 	of Asiatic Immigration 	into the 	Transvaal, but 	it very 	materially alters 	to their 	prejudice the 	status of British 	Indians resident 	in the Colony. 
  It 	is not “a 	purely temporary 	measure”; for, while 	it is true 	that Mr. 	Duncan stated that it 	was introduced 	without prejudice 	to further 	legislation, there was 	no question 	of the 	Ordinance itself 	being “a temporary 	measure”. In 	its very nature 	it is not  capable 	of being 	temporary, because it 	is intended to 	carry out 	once and 	for all, so 	it is said, registration 	of British 	Indians in the 	Transvaal, and 	to compel 	them to 	carry passes, 	euphemistically called 	registration certificates. 
  Instead 	of preserving 	the status 	quo and relieving 	the Asiatic residents 	from “certain 	manifest grievances”, 	it reduces 	their status 	and removes 	not a single grievance.  While 	the prejudice 	on the 	part of 	the general 	portion of the 	white community is 	admitted, the 	manner of 	giving effect to 	it is purely 	a creation 	of the Government 	and the 	Transvaal community is 	certainly not 	privy to 	the framing of 	the Ordinance. 	Its plan is 	undoubtedly drastic, but 	honest. If 	it had its own way, 	perhaps that 	portion of 	it which represents 	anti- Asiatic 	agitation will pass 	legislation involving 	deportation of 	Indian residents in 	the Colony. 	Such, in 	effect, it 	will be 	reme- mbered, 	was the resolution 	passed by 	the so-called 	National Convention.  That 	the Transvaal 	is on the 	eve of getting 	Responsible Govern- ment 	is an additional 	reason why, instead 	of the 	British Indian 	position being 	prejudiced by the 	Ordinance in 	question,  it should be 	so commended to 	the incoming 	Government as to 	bear the 	Imperial stamp; 	that is to say, the 	status of British 	 Indians should be 	levelled up 	to that enjoyed 	by British 	Indians at 	the Cape.  There is absolutely no prooflibtech_108_footnotelibtech_109_footnotejustifying a dangerous departure from 	the traditions 	of Crown 	Colony Government in 	the shape 	of invidious class distinctions. 
 
  Involving, 	as the 	question does, 	Imperial considerations 	of the 	highest order, 	the Imperial Government 	should think  twice 	before sanctioning panic 	legislation which 	underlies the 	Ordin- ance. 
 The reasons we have above given for withholding the Royal sanction are also reasons showing why a commission should be appointed to go into the question, and to place such evidence before the public and the Government as is, on your own showing, at present lacking. You, Sir, have rightly said that every Indian returning from the Transvaal to India returns a missionary to sow discontent. We, who have the privilege of representing the community, can state that we have given only the most moderate expression to the sentiments of the thousands who attended the mass meeting referred to by you. It is not possible for us to describe in words the bitterness which animated that meeting regarding the measure. The lower the status of the Indian, the greater would be his hardship under the Ordinance. The well-to-do Indian may by reason of his position be able to escape the grossest forms of oppression which must inevitably flow from the Ordinance. Poor people were, under the registration effected by Lord Milner’s advice, dragged at four o’clock on a cold winter’s morning -from their beds in Johannesburg, Heidelberg and Potchefstroom, and marched to the police station, or Asiatic Offices, as the case might be.libtech_110_footnoteIt is they who under the Ordinance would be hustled by the Kaffir Police at every turn, and not the better-class Indians. They, therefore, feel the treatment more than we do, because to them their hardship is an ever-present reality.
 The Indian community has all along contended that there is no unauthorized influx on a wholesale scale, that there is no attempt by the community to countenance any such influx, that the present machinery is absolutely effective to check unauthorized entry and the documents already held by Indians are sufficient for purposes of identification. If these statements are challenged, as they have been challenged, is it not at least in common fairness necessary to appoint a commission of enquiry [?]

 DEAR SIR LEPEL,
 I am obliged to you for your note. The Times leader is very important and certainly on the whole sympathetic.
 May I venture to ask you to write a short letter to The Times emphasizing the question of discontent and the Imperial importance of the question.
 I beg to enclose herewith copy of the letterlibtech_111_footnotewritten by Mr. Ally and myself to The Times.
 I have been considering with Sir Muncherji the question of forming a permanent committee for the South African Indians. The work of the Deputation will be frittered away if it cannot be continued after its return to South Africa. If a small committee was formed it would be a very great assistance. May we rely upon your co- operation. Mr. Ally and I will be obliged if you will lend your name to the committee. A cable has just been received from Johannes-burg sanctioning the formation of such a committee.

     DEAR 	SIR HENRY,  November 	12, 1906 
  	I am obliged to you for your note of the 12libtech_118_footnoteinstant. We have received today the following 	cablegram: “Have affidavits Godfrey obtained signatures blank 	paper false pretences using name bias (code word for British Indian 	Association). Signatures now with drawn. Cabling (Lord) Elgin. 	Papers publish full report confe-rence.” This cablegram means that 	a full report has been publis-hed  in Johannesburg and reference has 	evidently been made to the cablegram referred to by Lord Elgin. Mr. 	Ally and I know the gentleman well. Personally I can only say that 	he is a little insane. He is a medical man and has taken his degree 	at Edinburgh and in measures to be taken against the Ordinance he 	would go much further than we should. Indeed he even advocated 	violent measures, that is simply because there is no problem placed 	before him for solution but he loses his mental balance. There are 	other matters connected with Dr. Godfrey proving the statement made 	by me which I need not touch upon  at any rate for the present. His 	two brothers are 
 undergoing legal education here and they have signed the personal representationlibtech_119_footnoteaddressed to Lord Elgin of which they have sent you a copy. They too are enraged at their brother’s con-duct and even went so far as to suggest that they should publicly disown his conduct.libtech_120_footnoteMr. Ally and I have, however, told them that such a course is not at all necessary. As you have asked the questionlibtech_121_footnote, I thought I should place the above information at your disposal.

TIMES’’libtech_128_footnote","
            THE 	EDITOR 	THE TIMES [LONDON]  SIR,   CONSTITUTIONAL CLUB,  [LONDON,]  November 	13, 1906 
    	All thoughtful men must welcome your weighty leader on the Transvaal 	British Indian question which has recently come to the fore by 	reason of the visit of the Indian Deputation from the Transvaal. I 	have carefully read and re-read your remarks and I must confess that 	all that you have stated goes conclusively to show that Lord Elgin 	cannot possibly advise His Majesty to sanction the Asiatic Law 	Amendment Ordinance. As Sir Lepel graphically put before Lord Elgin, 	“The toad under the harrow knows where and whether it is hurt!” 	The Ordinance which is supposed to relieve British Indians has given 	rise to the greatest irritation to the Indian community. You will 	perhaps give me the credit for knowing fairly intimately the British    
 Indian question in South Africa which I have always considered to be one of the first-class magnitude. You, sir, have now very ably shown the Imperial importance of the question.
 About a year ago, at a sitting of the Legislative Council of the Transvaal, Sir George Farrar suggested that a commission should be sent to the Transvaal to enquire into the whole position. I immediately accepted the proposition and approached Mr. Lyttelton who, had he been still at the Colonial Office,libtech_129_footnotelibtech_130_footnoteI doubt not, would have appointed a commission.
 In view of the approaching Colonial Conference, it becomes doubly imperative that the Imperial Government should appoint such a commission so that the Conference may have reliable data before it to go upon. There can be no conceivable objection from any quarter to the appointment of such a commission. Not to prejudge the case it will be only reasonable to withhold the Royal sanction for the Ordinance in question, pending the report of any such commission that may be appointed.
 I re-echo your opinion regarding the terrible discontent that is being spread by British Indians from South Africa. As you very properly say, it is not a question of political disabilities but one of inability to enjoy the ordinary rights of a British subject or even a human being in a civilized country. If the Colonies persist in their policy of exclusion, they will force on the mother country for solution a very serious problem which the  late  Sir  William  Wilson  Hunterslibtech_131_footnoteused to reiterate in your columns, namely, “Is India to remain a part of the British Dominions or not?” He who runs may  read that England will find it difficult to hold India if her people, immediately they migrated to British Colonies, are to be insulted and degraded as if they belonged to barbarous race.

  	Perhaps it is necessary for me to say a word about the“petition” 	from certain Indians regarding the British Indian Deputation from 	the Transvaal which was the subject matter of question and answer in 	Parliament as reported in your issue of yesterday’s date. It is 	said    
 therein that I do not possess any mandate, that I am a professional agitator and that my advocacy of the Indian cause has resulted in harm being done to the Indians.
 The appointment of my colleague and myself was made unanimously at a public meeting. We hold a document to that effect.libtech_141_footnoteThe mass meeting at Johannesburg which was convened by me as Secretary to the British Indian Association approved of the principle of the Delegation. The first signatorylibtech_142_footnoteto this “petition” was present at the meeting and spoke strongly in support of all the principal resolutions. He, moreover, offered himself as one of the delegates but was not accepted. The “petition” is signed by two Indians. It is necessary to distinguish the “petition” from a paper purporting to have been signed by 437 Indians and repudiating our mandate. As to this, the following cable was received by the Delegates from Johannes burg on the 10th instant: “Have affidavits Godfrey obtained signat- ures blank paper false pretences using name bias (code word for the British Indian Association, Transvaal) signatures now with drawn cabling (Lord) Elgin papers publish full report conference.” The foregoing cable was evidently sent on the telegra-phic report of the interview sent by the Press correspondents.
 The incident does not mean that the two signatories of the “petition” approve of the Asiatic Ordinance. On the contrary, in their opinion evidently I am the mischievous cause of the legislation which they detest as much as the other Indians. Their attitude resolves itself into personal objection to me and not into one of approval of the Ordinance.
 As I have been allowed by the Colonial Office to see the “petition”— I know that the expression “professional agitator” means a paid agitator —I may then state that the  thirteen  years’ service rendered by me to my countrymen has been a labour of love and [a matter of the] keenest pleasure to me.
 Opinions may differ as to the usefulness or otherwise of my services. The late Sir John Robinson considered that they were not
 
 useless.libtech_143_footnoteMr.  William   Hoskenlibtech_144_footnotelibtech_145_footnoteand   others   in   the   Transvaal   also encourage me in the work I am trying to do, namely, to cement the relations between the European and the British Indian subjects in  South Africa by removing all cause for misunderstanding.
 The only reason for tendering this explanation is that the sacred mission which I have come here to discharge may not be prejudiced in the eyes of the public by leaving unchallenged the allegation in question.

At the same time he is to live as cheaply as possible. Do 	you know a home that would take him without pecuniary consideration? 	Of course he    
 would pay for his board and lodging but he cannot pay more than £1 per week. It does not matter where such a home is so long as it enables him to reach the British Museum within half an hour or at the most three quarters of an hour.

  November 	16, 1906    DEAR 	SIR,    	As you were good enough to show very great sympathy with the cause 	of British Indians in the Transvaal, may I suggest your using your 	influence with the Boer leaders in the Transvaal? I feel certain 	that they did not share the same prejudice against British Indians 	as against the Kaffir races but as the prejudice against Kaffir 	races in a strong form was in existence in the Transvaal at the time 	when the British Indians immigrated there, the latter were 	immediately lumped together with the Kaffir races and described 	under the generic term “Coloured people”. Gradually the Boer 	mind was habituated to this qualification and it refused to 	recognize the evident and sharp distinctions that undoubtedly exist 	between British Indians and the Kaffir races in South Africa.  	If you were to place this position before them in your own graphic 	style and show to them that British Indians have an ancient 	civilization behind them, that they do not aspire to any“ 	political power in the Transvaal, that they are a mere handful, 	i.e., 13,000, and 
 that further immigration can easily be regulated without accentuating class difference, I have no doubt that some at least of the Boer leaders would listen to you and give effect to your suggestions.
 The Indian community in the Transvaal will feel deeply grateful to you if you could see your way to influence the Boer mind in the direction I have ventured to suggest to you.

 I am afraid that we cannot leave before the 1st week of next month because the committee will require organizing and there will be some work to be done after the interview with Morley.

         November 	16, 1906    With 	reference to 	the “petition” 	signed by Dr. 	W. Godfrey 	and C. 	M. Pillay, apparently on behalf of 437 other British Indians, who discla im having given Mr.  M. 	K. Gandhi any mandate to represent them in England, (which formed 	the subject of    a question 	in the 	House by Sir 	Henry Cotton last 	week) Mr. Gandhi has 	stated to 	a representative 	of South 	Africa that a cablegram 	has been 	received from Johannesburg 	stating that the 	signatures of 	the 437 British 	Indians mentioned were 	obtained on 	blank paper by Dr. Godfrey, using the name of the British Indian Association.  Mr. 	Gandhi said:  	So far as the position of the Ordinance itself is concerned, it is 	not affected by the petition (which is signed only by Dr. Godfrey 	and an interpreter named C. M. Pillay), as Dr. Godfrey was the 	strongest opponent of the Ordinance at the mass meeting held at the 	old Empire Theatre in September, when it was decided to send a 	Deputation to England. The only reason I can assign for his action 	is that he was very much annoyed because he himself was not elected 	as one of the delegates when the matter came before the committee 	appointed at that meeting to nominate the representatives to go to 	London. The petition of Messrs Godfrey and Pillay represents that I 	am a “professional political agitator”. As to that statement it 	can only     
 arise from ignorance or wilful misrepresentation, because my services to my fellow-countrymen in South Africa for the last thirteen years have been purely a labour of love, and a matter  of  the  keenest pleasure to me.
 Mr. Gandhi, in conclusion, showed a document, dated “Johannesburg, October 1, 1906,” and signed “Abdool Ganie, Chairman, British Indian Association,” certifying that “M. K. Gandhi, Esquire, Honorary Secretary of the British Indian Association, and Hajee Ojer Ally, Esquire, President of the Hamidia Islamic Society, have been elected as Delegates to proceed to London for the purpose of submitting to the Imperial authorities the Indian view of the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, as also to interview friends in England of British Indians in South Africa.”

97,"November 16, 1906",MEETING AT LONDON INDIAN SOCIETYlibtech_159_footnote,"
    
 [After November 16, 1906]
 
 At a well-attended meeting of the London Indian Society, on the 3libtech_160_footnoteNovember, at 84 and 85, Palace Chambers,  Westminster,  the  Hon’ble Dadabhai Naoroji in the chair, Mr. James Godfrey of Natal, who is at present keeping his terms for the Bar and has passed his final examination, gave a paper under the above titlelibtech_161_footnotelibtech_162_footnote. Below is  given  a condensation of the paper:
 Since my arrival here, I have had ample opportunities of studying these people and I hope to show you that there are very many valuable lessons to be learnt from them.
 Let us examine and analyse them and see what qualities have made them what they are and what are the potent factors which are securing for them the universal triumph which seems to be growing larger and larger every day, and which must command the admiration of even their bitterest enemies. I was led to make this examination myself owing to what I felt were unsatisfactory replies given to me by a large number of our countrymen when leaving this land for home. Invariably I put them the question: “What has England taught
 
 you or what improvements have you in mind to suggest to your  people when you return?” And to such questions I  received  the painful and saddening reply to the effect that they had been too much occupied with their immediate studies and occupations to devote any time to or concern themselves about the people or things surrounding them. As to improvements at home, that is a question which affects local interests and, therefore, must necessarily need local considera- tion, etc. Now gentlemen, I put it to you that such replies are anything but satisfactory. Whether this be the frame of mind of the majority who go back, I will not take upon myself the responsibility of stating.  I hope I shall be told I am mistaken. Be that as it may, the knowledge of the fact of even one of us returning home in this mood of utter indifference and doubt, I feel, amply justifies a reference to  the subject in a paper of this kind. The Englishman abroad is one person and the Englishman at home is quite another. In the first case he proves himself to be a veritable tyrant and a despot, but in the second case, i.e., in England, few will say that he is not a desirable person.
 From this you will see, therefore, that we actually arrive in this country with more or less prejudiced views and ideas, and apparently some never seem to get beyond that stage, and can never see or appreciate any good in the Englishman. We never seem to realize that we have come all the way from home in order to benefit ourselves and secure that experience and status which it is somewhat difficult for us to secure in our own land. We come, not with the intention of merely qualifying in some particular profession, but of simultaneously gaining that wider experience of the world and its ways which can only be had by travelling in foreign countries. We defeat the very object of our visit to this country if we do not carry away with us some of the multifarious benefits derived by our sojourn here. We want, after our staying here, to go back with the very best that the place can give us... If we don’t, the loss is ours and we are not doing our duty to ourselves, much less to our country.
 The success of the Japanese is admitted on all hands to have been due chiefly to their having, for the last 40 years or more, sent out students and specialists for the express purpose of eliciting the best information, learning the newest and latest inventions and carrying back the cream of Europe’s learning, advancement and ideas of progress, all for the benefit of their country. Mark you, they did not
 only carry this knowledge and ideas back, but they actually applied them with a result and success which have astonished the whole world.
 Let us try and reckon up some of their good points only and see if they are worth copying. The bad points we leave aside. Throughout their whole history, we find that they have displayed a remarkable spirit of love for freedom and independence. Did they not have to fight for this bit of land which they now proudly call England? Did they not have both internal and external foes and that through many centuries? The wonderful genius of the race seems to have conspired with the strengthening influence of the place itself in securing a sure, certain and steady progress onward. The great American writer, R. W. Emerson, says: ‘These Saxons are the hands of mankind. They have the taste for toil, a distaste for pleasure or repose and the telescopic appreciation of distant gain. They are the wealth-makers and by dint of mental faculty which has its own conditions and terms. The Saxon works after liking or only for himself and to set him at work and begin to draw his monstrous values out of barren Britain, all dishonour, fret and barrier must be removed and then his energies begin to play.’
 We see then that the whole mind of the race, so to say, has been expanding proportionately. They have persevered in it and kept up an even game. The English game appears to be one of main force to main force, the planting of foot to foot, fairplay and open field, a rough tug without trick or dodging. One cannot entertain any reasonable doubt of their ability and energy. Just realize for one moment the nature of the lightly artificial construction of the whole fabric here. The very climate and geography are in themselves matters which are contrary to such conditions as would enhance a natural existence. Bacon says: ‘Rome was a state not subject to paradoxes, but England subsists by antagonisms and contradictions and is a perfect museum of anomalies.’ Is it not true, though it has been humorously said, that ‘no fruits ripen in England but a baked apple’, and, again, is it not equally true that no indigenous animal worth the mention has ever before flourished in this country in comparison with other countries? Yet in spite of these natural difficulties they have, owing to their dogged perseverance, tact, zeal and energy, driven all before them and are now at the top of the tree. There seems to be some secret
 power which permeates the whole nation and makes for progress. They have pride and affection for their race. Do we not hear everyone of them boasting and priding himself on the fact of his being an Englishman? Does he not flout it to your face at every turn that because he is an Englishman therefore he rules? They have solidarity or responsibility and trust in each other. It has been said of the Englishmen that ‘they embrace their cause with more tenacity than their lives’.
 The paper was very well received. Messrs B. J. Wadia, M.A., Parmeshwar Lall, M.A., J. Gowrieshanker, M.A., Nathuram, Dwarka Das and several other gentlemen who took part in the discussion congratulated the lecturer on his broad-mindedness and  theability  with which he had written his paper. Some of the speakers thought that Mr. Godfrey had over-drawn-the picture in favour of the Englishman, but Mr. Godfrey in his reply, whilst thanking the members for their sympathetic reception, said that he had purposely left out the other side of the Englishman’s character, but he wanted to place before the members of the Society what he conside-red was best in his character and what was worthy ofimitation. A vote of thanks to the lecturer and to the Chair brought the proceedings to a close.

 At the reception were present Mr. Syed Ameer Ali (ex-Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta), Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, Mr. Shamji Krishnavarma, Mr. S. A. Quadir, Miss Martha Craig, Miss A.
A. Smith, Mrs. Conseil, His Excellency Hamid Beg (Councillor of the

Mr. M. H. Kidwai, of Lucknow, received the guests.
 Mr. Sohraworthy, the retiring Secretary, has had a distinguished career in London. He is a much-travelled man and is the author of Malki Law, as also the Sayings of Mahomed. He has made Pan- Islamism his life work, and in his striking, though somewhat lengthy speech, he clearly showed that the object of Pan-Islamism was to bring together under its fold the different sects of Mahomedans and carry on a peaceful propaganda of the faith of the Prophet with a view to promote universal brotherhood.
 This Society, which was originally called the Anjuman-e-Islam, was founded in 1886 in London. On the 23rd of June, 1903, it was re- named the Pan-Islamic Society. Mr. Ameer Ali was at one time President of this body.
The following are the avowed objects of the Society:
  To 	promote the 	religious, social, moral 	and intellectual 	advancement of 	the Mussulman world.  To 	afford a 	centre of 	social union to 	Muslims from all 	parts of 	the world.  To 	promote brotherly 	feelings between Muslims, and 	to facilitate 	intercourse between them.  To 	remove misconceptions 	prevailing among 	non-Muslims regarding 	Islam and Mussulman.  To 	render legitimate 	assistance to the 	best of 	its ability 	to any 	Muslim requiring it 	in any part 	of the world.  To 	provide facilities 	for conducting 	religious ceremonies in 	non-Muslim countries.  To 	hold debates 	and lectures, 	and to 	read  papers  likely 	 to further 	the interests 	of Islam.  To 	collect subscriptions 	from all 	parts of 	the world 	in order 	to build 	a mosque 	in London, 	and to 	endow it, 	and to extend 	the burial 	ground for 	the Muslims in London. 
Its members are ordinary, extraordinary and honorary.
 The annual subscription for ordinary resident members is 10/6; non-resident members pay only an entrance fee of 5/6.
 Mr. Shaik Mushir Hoosain Kidwai, c/o Messrs Thos. Cook & Son, Ludgate Circus, London, E.C., the present acting Honorary Secretary, receives and answers all communications.

 Has the Right Hon’ble the Colonial Secretary received a petition from Mr. Abdul Ganie, Chairman of the British Indian Association of the Transvaal, regarding the Vrededorp Stands Ordinance published in the Transvaal Government Gazette dated September 28 last? Will His Lordship advise His Majesty, under the power reserved under the Letters Patent, to disallow the Ordinance, in that it imposes on British Indians and other Coloured people a restriction as to holding leases of or remaining in occupation of Stands in Vrededorp?
 Is it not a fact that Vrededorp is contiguous to a Location called the Malay Location and inhabited largely by British Indians?
 Is it not a fact that British Indians are already in occupation of several Stands in Vrededorp, that some of them have built substantial structures on some Stands and that they are carrying on their trade on such Stands?
 Is it not also a fact that many British Indians resided in Vrededorp during the Dutch regime and that there was no objection taken to their presence during that time?
 QUESTION II
 In view of the foregoing question does it not appear to the Right Hon’ble the Secretary of State for the Colonies necessary that an impartial commission should be appointed to investigate the whole question of the status of British Indians in the Transvaal?
 
 
 QUESTION III
 Is there any precedent for legislation in the British Colonies after the manner of the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance published in the Transvaal Government Gazette dated the 28th September, 1906?
 Is it not a fact that in no part of His Majesty’s Dominions are British Indians, occupying the status of British Indians in the Transvaal, made to carry passes contemplated by the said Ordinance?
 QUESTION IV
 Has the Right Hon’ble the Secretary of State for the Colonies seen the report of an appeal heard by the Supreme Court of the Transvaal on the .... day of.... libtech_166_footnotein the matter of Rex v. Mahomed Hafejee Moosa wherein a British Indian lad under eleven years of age, living with his father, was arrested and charged before the Magistrate at Volksrust, found guilty, sentenced to pay a fine of £50 or to undergo imprisonment for a period of three months and to leave the Transvaal after the completion of his term of imprisonment or paying the fine as the case may be?
 Is His Lordship aware that the Supreme Court has quashed the conviction and made scathing comments condemning the adminis- tration of the Peace Preservation Ordinance regarding the British Indians? What action do the Government intend to take in connection with the matter?

 DEAR SIRS,
 I have the press cuttings sent by you. I note that you have not sent me Sir Roper Lethbridge’s letter in The Times of yesterday. I
 
 should like you to be most accurate so that I may feel quite safe that I [am] receiving all the cuttings. I have not also received cuttings from the 20th October to the 3rd November. I know there were many references to the British Indian position in South Africa including the Transvaal and Natal. I had my attention drawn to references in The African World also. If you could complete these cuttings, I shall be obliged. Cheque will be sent to you in due course.

 DEAR MR. HALL,
 Mr. Naoroji has paid £3.10.0 for a cable he sent to the British Indian Association in Johannesburg in connection with the Asiatic Ordinance. The Acting Secretary of the Association now writes to me that he has received a memo from Mr. Naoroji.  Will  you  kindly refund the amount to Mr. Naoroji out of the funds sent to the Committee for disbursements about the Ordinance. I had intended to speak to you about it when I saw you at Palace Chambers. I have been so much pressed for work that I have not been able to attend at the Palace Chambers as often as I should like to. Last Tuesday we met but the matter quite escaped me.

 DEAR SIR,
 I thank you for your letter of the 14th instant together with enclosures. The young manlibtech_170_footnotelibtech_171_footnotefor whom I have written to you,libtech_172_footnotelibtech_173_footnoteis  to study for the Matriculation Examination at the same time that he is studying for the Bar. He has already kept some terms. His previous education is very poor and it is necessary for him, if he is to hold his own in future, to go as far as the Matriculation of London University. The young man will stay there, or anywhere he is put, the whole of his time. His previous certificate given to him by the Head Master of the Higher Grade Indian School in Durban is filed with the Steward of Lincoln’s Inn. Would you require production of the certificate or will a certificate from me be considered enough? I may state that he is not a Christian but a Hindoo.
 I notice that the current term is half finished; will there be any reduction on that account?

 INTERVIEWS WITH LEADERS: SYMPATHY AND PROMISE OF HELP
 The last week has been very busy. We have had not a moment’s leisure. We saw Mr. Theodore Morison of Aligarh and the well-known Mr. Stead of the Review of Reviews. Mr. Stead has boldly come out to give us all the help he can. He was therefore requested to write to the Boer leaders that they should not consider Indians as being on the same level as Kaffirs.libtech_179_footnote
 We also saw Miss Smith, a lady who contributes to the Punjabee and the Amrita Bazar Patrika. Miss Winterbottom, the Secretary of the Union of Ethical Societies, has promised to render all possible help.libtech_180_footnote
 We had an interview on Transvaal and Natal matters with the Private Secretary to Lord Elgin. We talked about many things, and we may hope for some satisfactory results. From Mr. Churchill’s reply to Sir Henry Cotton it appears that, for the present at least, the Ordinance will not receive assent.
 The Pan-Islamic Society has made a representation to  Lord Elgin, saying that the feelings of the Muslim community have been

 greatly hurt by the application of the Ordinance to Turkish Muslims, while the Christians and the Jews of Turkey have been excluded from its purview. Thus, help is being received from all quarters.
 Mr. Ally had an interview with Sir Richard Solomon  and because of this too, we have some ground for hope.
 DR. GODFREY’S PETITIONlibtech_181_footnote
 There is no rose without  thorns.  And  these  hopes  have  a  thorn in the shape of  Dr.  Godfrey’s  petition.  I  am  not  depressed on  this  account.  Neither  need  it  hurt  our   feelings.   We   should not be angry with Dr. Godfrey. He is a child and lacks understanding. Often he is unaware of his own folly. He deserves pity rather than scorn. Lord Elgin’s secretary showed us his petition, in which he states that the Indian community has given no authority to Messrs Gandhi and Ally. Mr. Gandhi was a paid agitator and had amassed money through that trade. The whites of Durban had beaten him up in 1896libtech_182_footnoteand driven him away. His activities had resulted in great harm and created differences between the whites and the Coloured people. One Mr. Abdool Gani was the Chairman [of the British Indian Associa- tion] and he knew nothing [of all this]. Mr. Ally was a rebel who wanted to establish the authority of the Califlibtech_183_footnotelibtech_184_footnotein political matters also. The petition bears the signatures of Dr. Godfrey and Mr. C. M. Pillay. They also state that many persons did not sign the petition as they were afraid of the Association. Besides the petition, there is a document which is said to have been signed by 437 Indians. It says that Messrs Gandhi and Ally have no authority to act on behalf of the Indian community. The best part of the petition is now known to the public as Sir Henry Cotton asked a question about it in Parliament. As the question was raised by many, Sir Muncherji has addressed a letter [to The Times] on it, but this has not yet been published. Mr. Gandhi, too, has written one. And the two brothers of Dr. Godfrey who have been actively assisting the Deputation have also written to the Press. When all these letters are published, it is expected that the storm will blow over. It is necessary that all this news be published; it need not, however, cause any nervousness.
 
 
 
 ARTICLES IN LONDON “TIMES”
 A formidable article appeared last Saturday in The  Times.  A copy of it was despatched last week. In the article written by Sir Roper Lethbridge also, it is stated that India is very unhappy because of the sufferings of the Indian community.
 PERMANENT COMMITTEE
 The cablegram sanctioning the setting up of the permanent committee has been received. Accordingly a room has been rented for a year; £40 will have to be paid as rent. Sir Muncherji has helped a lot. He will probably become the chairman of the committee. Furniture worth £25 has been purchased. It is proposed to give a thanksgiving dinner to all the gentlemen who have helped us, and to announce the formation of the committee on that occasion. As the time is short, it remains to be seen how much of all this can be done. Mr. Ritch will work as secretary of the committee. As his financial position is not satisfactory, a nominal sum of £7.10.0 to £10 a month will have to be paid to him. He will give all his time to the committee. He is speaking on the 26th before the East India Association. If possible, I shall give a summarylibtech_185_footnotelibtech_186_footnoteof his speech next week. There is reason to hope that much of our work can be looked after by the committee. It should receive help from all over South Africa. Sir Muncherji has suggested that it may be named South Africa British Indian Vigilance Committee.

 HOTEL CECIL, LONDON, W.C. 2,
 November 20, 1906
 TO
 THE PRIVATE SECRETARY OF
 THE EARL OF ELGIN
 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES COLONIAL OFFICE
 DOWNING STREET DEAR SIR,
With reference to the interview that Mr. Ally and I had with you
 and Mr. Just in connection with the “petition” received from Dr. Godfrey and another and the papers said to be signed by 437 Indians and in connection with matters arising out of His Lordship’s reply to the Deputation that waited on him on the 8th day of November, in accordance with your instructions, Mr. Ally and I submit herewith a written statement for submission to His Lordship.
         Enclosure              [ENCLODURE]  I 	have the honour to be, Sir,  Your 	obedient servant,  M. K. GANDHI 
  STATEMENT 	BY THE DELEGATES 	ON BEHALF 	OF THE BRITISH 	INDIANS 	IN THE TRANSVAAL 	REGARDING 	THE “ PETITION” 	FROM  DR. 	WILLIAM GODFREY 	AND ANOTHER 	AND OTHER 	MATTERS 	“ THE 	PETITION”  The “petition” is signed by Dr. William Godfrey and C. M.  Pillay 	both of whom are personally known to the Delegates.   Petitioner 		William Godfrey 		is a doctor 		of Edinburgh 		University and 		is practising in Johannesburg.  The 		petitioner C. 		M. Pillay is 		an interpreter of 		no standing. He 		has been found 		to be the 		worse for 		liquor and 		may be described 		as a loafer.  
  So 	far as 	the recollection 	of the 	Delegates serves 	rightly, the points 	made in 	the “petition” 	are as follows: 
  Delegates 	have no mandate 	from the 	general body 	 of Indians.  Mr. 	Gandhi is 	a professional 	agitator who has made 	money out 	of his work.  Mr. 	Gandhi has 	caused an 	estrangement between 	Europeans and 	Indians and 	his advocacy 	has resulted 	in harm 	to the community. He 	was mobbed 	at Durban 	by the 	European community. He 	is proprietor of 	Indian Opinion.  Mr. 	Ally is 	Chairman and 	founder of a 	politico-religious body 	which has as 	its object 	recognition of 	the Sultan 	as both 	the spiritual 	and political 	head of the Moslems.  A 	Mr. Abdul Ganie 	is President of the 	British Indian 	Association.  The 	petitioners have 	not been 	able to receive 	support for their 	contentions because of 	the intimidation 	on the 	part of 	the British 	Indian Association. 
  As to (a), the Delegates enclose herewith letterlibtech_198_footnotelibtech_199_footnotesigned by the Chairman 	of the British Indian 	Association. Their 	election was 	unanimous. It 	took place at 	a meeting 	of the 	Association that was 	largely attended. 	There was 	no protest 	sent  to  the  	Association although the 	election was 	before the 	public for 	a long time.  As 	to (b), Mr. 	Gandhi has 	received no 	remuneration for 	his public 	work throughout his 	thirteen years’ 	career. He has 	from time to 	time contributed 	to the 	funds of 	the Association. 	The work 	has been 	purely a 	labour of 	love. His Lordship 	is further 	referred to 	correspondence that 	took place in The 	Star of 	Johannesburg on 	the 25th 	October in 	refutation of 	a somewhat 	similar statement made 	by The 	Star on 	the 23rd October.  As 	to (c), Mr. Gandhi 	is totally 	unaware of any 	estrangement having taken place between Europeans and Indians by reason of his 
 
 advocacy; on the contrary, his supreme effort has been to bring about a reconciliation between the two communities, such being the avowed object of the Natal Indian Congress, of which he was the honorary Secretary and one of the founders, [and] of the British Indian Association of which he is the present Secretary. On this point His Lordship is further referred to the following letter from the late Sir John Robinson, which is one among many received from distingu- ished residents at the time of his departure for India in 1901:
 I beg to  thank  you  for  your  kind  invitation  to  the  meeting at  the Congress Hall this evening (October 15, 1901). It would have given me great pleasure to have been present on the occasion of so well-earned a mark of respect to our able and distinguished fellow-citizen, Mr. Gandhi, but unfortunately my state of health prevents my going out at night, and I am for the present debarred from taking part in any public function, so I must ask you to kindly excuse my inability to attend.Not the less heartily do I wish all success to this public recognition of the good work done and the many services rendered to the community by Mr. Gandhi.libtech_200_footnote
 The chief reason for his having organized the Indian Ambulance  Corps  at   the   time   of   the   Boer   Warlibtech_201_footnoteand   the   Indian Stretcher[-Bearer] Corps at the time of the Native Rebellion, was to bring about such [re]conciliation, by showing that British Indians were not unworthy to be citizens of the Empire and were capable of recognizing their obligations if they also insisted on their rights.
  As 	to (d), it 	is true that Mr. Gandhi 	was mobbed 	on the 	13th January, 1897 	on his 	return from India on 	a misrepresentation 	about his 	advocacy of 	the Natal 	Indian cause in India. 	Public apology was 	given to 	him on 	the 14th and when the 	whole of the 	position became known, the 	late Mr. 	Escombe invited him 	to see 	him and ever since 	that time he had 	the privilege of 	enjoying the 	late Mr. Escombe’s 	friendship. The 	late Mr. Escombe at 	his request 	blessed the leaders 	of the 	Natal Indian Ambulance 	Corps and of 	his own accord 	gave them a tea 	party and 	made a 	very eulogistic and 	public-spirited speech 	on the 	occasion.libtech_202_footnoteAfter the 	mobbing incident, 	he remained 	in Durban 	up to 	his return 	to India 	in 1901. 
 
 
  As 	to (e), it 	is true that Mr. 	Gandhi is 	the real 	proprietor of 	Indian Opinion from 	which no profits 	are made 	and to 	which he 	has devoted 	the whole of his savings. There are two Englishmen associated with 	him in that 	work and they and several 	Indians have, for the 	sake of 	the paper, 	reduced themselves to 	voluntary pauperism. The 	paper is 	being run on Tolstoy’s 	and Ruskin’s 	lines. Its publicly 	declared mission 	is to bring 	the two communities 	together and become an 	educative medium for 	the Indian community.  As to (f)libtech_203_footnote, the terms in which Mr. Abdul Ganie has been spoken 	of are 	most derogatory 	and a 	product of 	ignorance. He 	is the managing 	partner of one 	of the 	most flourishing firms 	of Indian 	merchants in 	South Africa. 	Mr. Abdul Ganie has been 	the unchallen- ged 	President of 	the Association since 	its inception. 	He is a resident 	of the 	Transvaal of 	25 years’ standing and 	has come in 	contact with most 	of the 	British officials 	including High Commissioners and 	is very 	well known 	and is 	respected by 	European merchants of standing.  As to (g)libtech_204_footnotelibtech_205_footnote, Mr. Ally’s whole life in South Africa, that is to say 	a period 	of twenty-three 	years, has been devoted 	to the 	service of 	the Empire. 	He had 	the honour of 	coming in 	personal touch 	with Sir Richard 	Solomon, the late Lord 	Loch, the 	late Lord Rosemead, Dr. 	Jamieson, Sir 	Gordon Sprigg, 	Sir James Sievright and 	the present 	officials in 	the Transvaal. 	He was 	asked by the 	Cape Government, at 	the time of the 	Malay discontent; 	regarding the position 	of a 	burial ground, 	to quell 	the discontent which 	he was 	successful in 	doing and 	for which 	he was 	thanked by 	the Government. 	This was 	in 1885; 	He has had the honour 	often to 	speak—being a 	voter himself at 	the Cape—on public 	platforms in support 	of the British 	Party candidate as 	opposed to 	Bond candidates. 	His free 	services were 	utilized by 	the Uitlander 	Committee for receiving 	signatures to the 	petition that 	was forwarded 	to the late Queen 	in connection 	with the Uitlander 	grievances. 
 It is untrue that the Hamidia Islamic Society, of which he is the Founder and President, has as its object recognition of the Sultan as the political head of the Moslem world. It is formed essentially to help poor Moslems, to defray the expenses of the burials of poor
 
 Moslems, to do among them the work of social regeneration and to remove their special hardships.
 Sir Richard Solomon, whom Mr. Ally saw on Friday last, has kindly consented that his name might be mentioned to His Lordship as guarantee of his intense loyalty and devotion to the Empire, if such be needed.
  As 	to (h), the allegation 	of intimidation 	is devoid 	of foundation. 	Poor people, who 	would be 	the greatest 	sufferers under the 	Ordinance, do 	not require 	the slightest 	encouragement to make 	an effort for 	their deliverance 	from the 	impending calamity, for 	such it 	undoubtedly is 	to them. 
 The Delegates respectfully claim to be the most moderate exponents of the sentiments of over 10,000 Indians in the Colony of the Transvaal. It is not possible to give His Lordship an adequate notion of the bitter feeling engendered by the Ordinance. Many Europeans, including a government official, were present at the great Mass Meeting, which resolved, without a dissentient voice, to send a deputation. The visitors fully realized the depth of feeling to which the community was moved. His Lordship is referred for a description of the meeting to The Star, The Leader and The Rand Daily Mail which published fairly full reports of the meeting.
 SUGGESTED EXPLANATION OF PETITIONER’S CONDUCT
  Dr. 	Godfrey is 	a hot-headed 	youth, without 	any experience 	of practical 	life in 	the world. 	He only 	finished his 	studies over 	two years 	ago. He has never 	before,  except 	 in  connection 	 with  the Asiatic 	Law Amendment 	Ordinance, come forward to 	do public work. 	He himself 	attended the Mass 	Meeting and 	spoke on 	the principal 	resolutions, including 	the resolutions 	condemning the Ordinance, 	appointing a 	commission and 	advocating going 	to gaol 	in preference 	to the 	submission to 	the carrying 	of passes. 	When the 	time came for 	selecting the delegates, 	he came 	forward as a 	candidate but 	was not selected. 	He sent 	a telegram 	at Cape 	Town wishing success to 	Mr. Ally and has given 	him a 	note of 	introduction to 	his wife’s parents in 	Edinburgh, which reads as follows: 
 This is to introduce to you one of our best of friends Mr. H. O. Ally. He is leaving here to fight the Indian cause and after his battles he will no doubt take a trip to Scotland. He will wire by what train he will be coming up and on what date. By religion he is an Islam and as such I will write you in detail
 
 as to the modes of their living especially as regards to their food and I hope (after my next week’s letters) you will make him as happy and cheery as you can during his stay in Edinburgh. Don’t forget to let him have a sight of the glorious F. Bridge and our ain little wee lael home at Tynecastle Terrace. John I have no doubt will know Mr. Ally well. It is the same who gave him the confetti before he left.
 Yours aff [ectionately,] (signed ) WILLIAM
 The original is hereto attached for His Lordship’s inspection. He was for a long time one of Mr. Gandhi’s clients and he was associated with Mr. Gandhi in nursing the plague patients in 1904 and at the time did very valuable work for the relief of the patients. The only way therefore his conduct can be explained is to ascribe it to his hot-headedness. The disappointment in this connection seems to have unhinged his mind. That appears to be the most charitable constru- ction to place upon his conduct, otherwise his strong condemnation of the Ordinance, his strong recommendation to Mr. Ally, would be inconsistent with the despatch of the petition. From the following cablegram received by the Delegates and already sent to His Lordship,libtech_206_footnoteit   would  appear  that  437  Indian  signatures  taken  on  a separate document have been received on false pretences:
 Have affidavits Godfrey obtained signatures blank paper false pretences using name bias (code word for British Indian Association) signatures now withdrawn cabling (Lord) Elgin papers publish full report conference.
  The 	Delegates have 	been obliged painfully 	and reluctantly 	to make 	the above 	statements, not 	in the slightest degree 	with the intention 	of injuring 	Dr. Godfrey 	or his 	associate and 	if they 	have been 	obliged to 	say anything 	regarding themselves, it 	is from a 	sense of 	paramount duty they owe 	to their 	countrymen, whose interests they 	have the honour 	to represent. 	As the personal 	element has 	been introduced 	here by 	the “petition” 	and in 	Johannesburg by 	The Star, 	 it has become 	necessary to show 	respectfully to 	His Lordship 	that, so far 	as the 	personal element is 	to count in 	the controversy, 	the position 	held by 	the Delegates, 	in their 	humble opinion, would weigh, after the 	most searching 	examination in favour 	of the community. They 
 
 
 would very much rather that the whole of the Ordinance were examined on its merits and they would therefore respectfully proceed to dwell upon some of the points that arise from His Lordship’s reply to the Deputation.
 LORD ELGIN’S REPLY: NO PERMIT UNDER LAW 3 OF 1885
  His 	Lordship is 	under the 	impression that there 	were permits under 	the Law 3 	of 1885 	during the 	Boer regime 	and that 	the Boer 	administration was lax 	in the 	administration of 	the permit 	law. The Delegates 	respectfully venture to 	state that the Boer  law  did not require 	any permits 	at all. 	The receipts 	given for £3 	therefore were not 	inaccurate. They 	were not 	permits authorizing 	entry or residence. 	There was 	no restriction 	on immigration 	contemplated by Law 	3 of 	1885, as 	the law itself 	shows. There 	was therefore 	no question of 	identification 
 The permits came into vogue only after the introduction of the Peace Preservation Ordinance of the British regime.
 This distinction is very material in order to show that the Asiatic Ordinance, now for consideration before His Lordship, is not an amendment but a new law. It does not make accurate that which was inaccurate under the Boer regime. It creates a new disability.
 VOLUNTARY THUMB-MARKS
  It 	is respectfully 	submitted that 	the voluntary act 	of the 	Indian community 	in putting 	thumb-marks on 	permits and 	registra- tion 	certificates was 	performed gracefully to 	please Lord 	Milner and 	to avoid legislation 	compelling such 	performance. It 	is therefore hardly fair to use the act as a precedent against the community. 
 NEW REGISTRATION
  The 	statement that 	new registration will 	give a final and 	indefeasible title 	to those 	who are registered 	is again, 	in the 	humble opinion of 	the Delegates, 	not in 	consonance with 	facts. The 	title of 	those who 	hold permits 	is today 	indefeasible in 	law. The 	 new Ordinance 	would actually 	cancel that title and 	not give 	it. After dispossessing the community 	of what 	it already possesses, 	it will 	restore a 	new title 	of doubtful 	value circumscribed by 	galling require- 	ments and 	penalties. It 	will, therefore, restore 	to the community 	only a part of what will 	be taken away from it. 
 
 INSPECTION
  Under 	the new Ordinance, 	it is possible 	to carry 	on a 	daily inspection. 	The assurance 	given to 	His Lordship, 	that the 	inspection will 	be yearly, 	is beside 	the mark. 	There is no guarantee 	of the 	same executive 	authority remaining in 	office. The experience 	of the community 	almost invariably 	has been 	that arbitrary power 	given to the 	executive in 	South Africa has 	been arbitrarily and 	almost fully 	exercised against 	British Indians. When 	a restrictive law is passed against 	a community 	labouring under popular prejudice, the 	executive has been 	powerless to 	resist popular 	demand for 	full enforcement 	of restrictions. 	This has happened 	even with the present 	executive in respect 	of Law 	3 of 1885 	and Peace 	Preservation Ordinance. So 	much has this been the 	case that the Indian 	community has had to 	go to the Supreme Court 	in order 	to resist 	the attempt 	of the 	executive to 	read into 	the above laws meanings 	they are not 	ordinarily capable 	of bearing. 
 PRAYER
  It 	is for the Indian 	community a 	matter almost of 	life and 	death. It 	is respectfully urged 	that the 	matter can 	only be 	properly sifted 	by a 	judicial commission. If 	His Lordship 	is not 	satisfied as 	to the full justice of 	the Indian 	contention, it 	is submitted that 	 the  decision should be 	suspended pending the 	inquiry of 	a commission.

 SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: I have the honour, sir, to head this deputation today in order to present to you two Delegates from South Africa, Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Ally.
 I would like to say with reference to Mr. Gandhi and a somewhat silly petition which has been sent from South Africa against him and his mission that this was the work of some mischievous schoolboy, and every one who knows Mr. Gandhi, or has been associated with his work for many years, as I have been, knows his single- hearted devotion to this particular cause and that without any personal motive or any reward. His methods and his motives have been altogether disinterested—to this I can pledge myself.
 One thing that I think I may say without presumption is this. No one knows better than you, sir, how strong the feeling of India is on this point. It has been brought before the India Office and the Colonial Office by successive Viceroys and Indian Secretaries; and Colonial Secretaries themselves have, in reply to the memorials which I have had the honour myself to submit to them, expressed quite as warm sympathy with the grievances of the British Indians in South Africa as Indian Viceroys or Indian Secretaries at home. That point does not require any elaboration: The position between England and her Colonies seems to me very much like that which is now existing between the Central Government of the United States and the State of California, and that position will become aggravated in many parts of the world. (‘Hear! Hear!’) The difficulty of the case is, of Corsica, exceedingly great. You have two opposite positions, one represented by the clear and somewhat crude position, which nevertheless has a dignified and a worthy basis—that every British subject under the English flag should be free in his person and to carry on everywhere, without interruption, honourably any occupation he may see fit to undertake. (‘Hear! Hear!’) That applies, sir, to the whole Empire, and it is met on the opposite side by the position, which opposes reduction of the wages of labour—so far as white people are concerned, of course, the desire, and the proper desire is that the rate of wages should rise. The introduction of a very industrious, temperate class, who can live on very little, tends to lower the rate of earnings of white people who cannot live on so small a sum. These are the two opposite poles, and they have to be connected peaceably by some bridge which we ask you, sir, to try and build.
 
 And I would also say, sir, that for two reasons you are the one person who can satisfy the claims of this exceedingly complicated case. In the first place, you hold the keys which shut and which unloose as Secretary of State for India.
 Let me explain in one word. Take Natal, for example. I have more than once, as Chairman of the East India Association, sent petitions to the Secretary of State for India, urging that no indentured coolies be allowed to go to Natal until the status of their fellow-subjects in South Africa is altered. Natal cannot get on without the Indians, and yet it persecutes them: and it persecuted them in old days much worse than the Transvaal did: and their position is no better now, although Natal requires Indian coolies every year more and more because English colonists cannot do the field work themselves. These are not countries which Englishmen can ever colonize.
 That, sir, is all that I think it is necessary to say, but I shall make a final personal appeal to you by saying that the other reason why I think you of all men are the one who can settle this question is that one of the classics you have given to the English people is a worklibtech_212_footnoteon compromise, in which I have very little doubt that the key to this exceedingly complicated question will be found.
 MR. GANDHI: On behalf of my colleague, Mr. Ally and myself, I beg to tender you our respectful thanks for giving to us an opportu- nity of placing our position before you, sir. But I do not make any apology for trespassing upon your most valuable  time,  because  I think, sir, that we have a right to come to you, our  responsible advocate and trustee, whenever we find our interests are in danger. The Asiatic Ordinance was, as Sir Lepel Griffin has said, approved by Lord Elgin, I believe, under a misapprehension. The Ordinance, in my humble opinion, departs from the Colonial policy hitherto follo-wed in connection with Colonial legislation. In my humble opinion it is without any justification whatever in that it draws, with reference to free immigrants, a colour-line against which Colonial Secretaries as well as Indian Secretaries have repeatedly protested, and protested with success. The Ordinance has been described by one of the South African colonists as one which will make us go about the streets with dog’s collars, and an indignant Indian at one of the meetings said that the treatment which would be meted out to us would be that, not of the colonial dog because he is a household pet, but of the Indian dog,
 
 which is a vile dog. I know that that was the bitterness of feeling that was engendered throughout the great mass of my community. I cannot help saying, sir, that the feeling that was given vent to by the great meeting at Krugersdorp was fully justified by the experience of British Indians over and over again throughout the Transvaal as well as other parts of South Africa The reasons given for the introduction of the Ordinance have been stated in an inspired article in The Star as well as by Mr. Duncan, viz., that there is an unauthorized influx of Asiatics or British Indians into the Transvaal, and that the British  Indian community is countenancing and encouraging such Asiatic influx. I think, sir, that that charge, or both of the charges, can be proved to be absolutely false. When they talk of an unauthorized influx, they mean that the British Indians enter the Transvaal without any permits, evading the police, and entering surreptitiously  in defiance of the Peace Preservation Ordinance, which should regulate the entry of all, but which really regulates the entry of British Indians into the Transvaal. The census was taken, and at the time of the census there were found to be 10,000 British Indians as against 12,000 permits, which by itself, in my humble opinion, disposes of the charge of surreptitious entry. If that charge is disposed of, it follows that there cannot be any encouragement on the part of the British Indian community.
 There have been during the last two years no less than 150 prosecutions—namely, 150 British Indians have been turned out by force. I do not know whether all these prosecutions were correctly brought, but the fact stands that these Indians were turned out. The Peace Preservation Ordinance has been strong enough to prevent Indian wives from accompanying their husbands; it has been strong enough to prevent Indian children of tender age from entering the Transvaal because they did not hold permits. The legislation that is at present in existence, the Peace Preservation Ordinance, is quite enough to prevent the surreptitious entry of British Indians. Anyhow, both these statements have been repeatedly denied by British Indians, and it is for that reason that we have been asking the local Government to appoint a small commission to inquire whether there has been really any such influx whatever.
 
 I do not think, however, that it is necessary for me to take up a long time; I have sent in a representation to Lord Elgin, which places before him the whole of our position; but I do wish to mention one thing, and that is the colonial feeling. I have been studying the history of restrictive legislation throughout South Africa—at any rate, during the last thirteen years—and I well remember that in 1894 Lord Ripon vetoed the Disenfranchising Bill because it applied to Asiatics alone. Mr. Chamberlain disapproved of a draft bill that was submitted in 1897 in connection with a restriction on British Indians. Mr. Chamberlain then said that he could not allow a colour-line to be drawn in legislation with the object of restricting Asiatic and British immigration, and hence we had the law of 1897. A similar veto was applied without the slightest hesitation with reference to the Asiatic Exclusion Bill in the Australian Parliament. But, sir, in the Transvaal-
 —also only last year, I believe it was, or in 1904—the Legislative Council passed the Native Land Tenure Bill, and I think it was passed without a single dissentient; but there was no hesitation whatsoever on the part of Mr. Lyttelton to veto the Land Tenure Bill. Now, sir, there is  a wide distinction between that Bill and the present Ordinance, and I venture to think that there was not, perhaps, held so strong an objection to that legislation as there is to this legislation, because it did not debar the Natives of the Transvaal from holding landed property. It only meant Natives who held landed property; but even that was considered by Mr. Lyttelton as being too strong, and he had no hesitation in vetoing that legislation.
 Much has been said with reference to the colonial sentiment against British Indians; I have no hesitation, sir, strange as it may appear, in denying any such sentiment. ‘The proof of the pudding is in the eating.’ The British Indians live in the Transvaal only because they are tolerated by the white colonists there. They may have to go to the British or white landlords for the land; they have to go to the white merchants for their goods, in respect of which they receive  six months’ credit. If there was real substantial general opposition against British Indians, I think, sir, that their existence would not be worth a day’s purchase. A meeting was held by the Mayor of Krugersdorp, which was attended by a few white men, who passed a resolution that they would boycott British Indians in connection with land purchase and sale. That boycott did not stand for one single day. There is only one place throughout the Transvaal where they have tried to boycott with success. We think we shall be able to work out our own salvation
 if only the prejudice which is restricted to the petty white  store-  keepers who are protected by the Government is removed. If this is not done, I can quite understand that our position must become intolerable; but otherwise, I think, sir, that it is possible even now to retain the position that we have in the Transvaal.
 MR. MORLEY: Are you speaking now, Mr. Gandhi, of the position of those who are already resident in the Transvaal?
 MR.  GANDHI:  Yes,  sir;  the  Ordinance  applies  solely  to   those who are now resident, and those  who  are  to  enter  the  Transvaal under the Peace Preservation Ordinance. I may  say  with  reference to future immigration that my friend, Mr. Ally, will probably deal with that point; and I may parenthetically remark that we have surrendered  the  whole  position,  and  we  have  accepted   the principle of restriction along the line[s] of the Cape Act, the only Act which, without drawing a colour-line, restricts British Indians from entering the Colonies because of the educational test—a very severe test. But we have thought it wise and prudent that we should accept that position even with reference to trading licenses. We have said that we would be quite willing to have our rights with reference to new trading licenses regulated and controlled by the municipal bodies; only such legislation ought also to apply to all, and not only to British Indians. My experience is that, wherever legislation is applied to a class of people, such legislation has worked very harshly; but when there is general legislation, such relief is possible to obtain. I venture to think, sir, that the Government does not mean to oppress those who are voiceless and voteless. I mention this fact not because we want political power. We have made it clear that, so far as British Indians are concerned, they do not aspire to any political power at all. But if we are to remain voteless, I do think the Government ought to protect those who are voteless, and not merely in a haphazard way, but that protection ought to be a real force, and we look to you, sir, as our advocate and trustee, to give us the protection we are entitled to, and to let us feel that we have it. (Applause.)
 MR. ALLY: I do not think it will be necessary for me, sir, to address you at length with regard to our mission. Mr. Gandhi has already submitted all the points and the facts. I am simply instructed by my community to place before you especially their position in the Transvaal. They feel—and feel keenly—that the Transvaal administration under the British Government are passing class legislation against
 them, whereas thousands of aliens of different races, such as Armenians, Syrians, Greeks, Russians, and Polish Jews, are entering the Transvaal without molestation and without any restriction. Our people remember the charter of 1857, as well as the messagelibtech_213_footnotethat the King sent to the Delhi Durbar—to the people—assuring them of their liberties under the British flag; therefore they feel it very keenly that they are oppressed and degraded by the passing of this Ordinance.
 I have spoken to you with regard to the aliens. Now the great question is that European feeling—that is, the colonists’—is against us. The colonists have never asked in any shape or in any way to degrade our people in the Transvaal. They have asked for protection against our trade competition, which is very strong against them, and all that they desire, sir, is not to see a great influx of Asiatics in[to] the Transvaal. We have from time to time said to the Government that we in the Transvaal are not desirous of seeing a great influx of Asiatics, and Mr. Duncan himself stated that the Imperial Government, with regard to the responsible government of the Transvaal, would deal with that question as well as with that of immigration. As we are not represented in the Legislative Council, the Imperial Government is our sole protector. Now, just to show you one point how this legislation and this Ordinance were thrust in. There was a clause which was unaffected by the new Ordinance, by which the descendants of the Dutch have been excluded from its operations, and yet no provision has been made for the Indian children born in South Africa, even when born in the Transvaal. Moreover, I personally pointed out to Mr. Duncan that it was unjust if you were to exclude any Asiatics who were born in South Africa, not to exclude the children of Indians. Now, just to show you how unjust it is, even under the Boer Government the Mahommedan subjects of the Sultan of Turkey were also affected by this Ordinance, but not the Christian subjects of the Sultan of Turkey. Now you can see how unjust this Ordinance is to Indians.
 I do not think it necessary for me to go to any length, but I would say to you simply this: that the present permits that we hold under the Peace Preservation Act are quite sufficient for identification, and that they can trace any Indians who are in the Transvaal unlawfully without any permission. Therefore there is no necessity for them to pass a new Ordinance, or that we should be subjected to this degradation, as we hold these permits at the present time. We consider that it is directed against us, and we consider it, sir, an indignity. This Ordinance, we consider, is bad in principle, because it would be a precedent to self-governing Colonies. I would just draw your attention, sir, to the fact that, under the responsible government of the Cape Colony, where I was a resident for thirteen years myself, I had the Parliamentary franchise and the right of holding land and property, and also the right of mining, and there even up to the present moment we have got the same rights. Now, under the
 
 Crown Colony, legislation has been contemplated directly against Indians. Therefore my Mahommedan community have especially sent me here to put before you the position of the Indians in the Transvaal. We have a just right to claim from our Government the same privileges and the same rights as any other British Subjects, unless the British Government are prepared to consent to the millions of Indians who are outside India having no protection. If the British Government are prepared to say so, then our people would know better than to get out of India in order to get under the British flag in the Colonies. (Applause.)
 MR. H. COX: I would like to make a very few remarks on this question... The Indian shopkeeper or the Indian trader is more efficient than the white shopkeeper, who, by the way, as Mr. Gandhi said, is generally, or often, not a British subject, but an alien from Southern Europe or Russia. The question, however, that the British Government now has to consider is whether to maintain a system of alien white shopkeepers as against British subjects. That is really the whole point: whether we are virtually to subsidize the alien shopkeeper in the Transvaal and to give him a preferential right to trade; and in connection with that arises the much larger question of the future race destiny of South Africa. From an examination of the statistics of population in South Africa, and especially of the growth of population, I  am absolutely convinced that South Africa is not, and never can be, a white man’s land. The blacks are increasing at an enormously greater rate than the whites. It is true that in South Africa the white man can live and breed; but that he cannot engage in labourer’s work is admitted on all sides. So it has been suggested by several people that, because white men will not do manual work, therefore we ought to make special provision to allow them to do shopkeeping work. Now I think that is an intolerable position to take up. It is an injustice to the rest of the population as well as to the Indians who want to engage in this work. Indians are more patient, and succeed better with the Natives. Moreover, a great many of the white people in South Africa welcome these Indian traders, because they find they can get things more cheaply from them. An English lady told me that her husband objected to her dealing with Indian traders, but, nevertheless, she always dealt with them, because she found she got things cheaper.
 . . . After all we have got to defend these Colonies. We pay for and provide the soldiers for the defence of the Transvaal. The position is therefore this: that when the Transvaal was a foreign country we claimed the right to interfere on behalf of our own subjects; now that it is our own Colony, defended by our own troops, we humbly withdraw and dare not oppose their will. If this is so, we may as well altogether abdi- cate our position as an Imperial race. (‘Hear! Hear!’)
 Then it is, in fact, an alien majority, for not only are the white population mainly Boers, but the immigrant whites are largely aliens. Therefore if we assent to this— because I consider this, to a large extent, the turning of the ways—we as Englishmen and on behalf of England assent to this proposition that the larger number of the inhabitants of the British Empire are to be regarded as permanently in a lower category than the minority of the British Empire. That is a very serious proposition for any British Government, and especially a Liberal Government, to assent to. Therefore the particular point I have to submit to you, Mr. Morley—and Sir Lepel Griffin forgot to mention it—is this, that before the present Government sanctions any legislation hostile to British Indians they will send to South Africa a commission to inquire into the whole question and to report to them.
 LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY: . . .I may say, personally, that the prayer of the memorial falls very far short of my sense of what the justice of the case requires. I feel that in this matter we are face to face with a difficulty which will grow greater and greater unless we lay hold of some principle. I fear that too many of the speeches have been rather apologetic than challenging the bad principle itself...Now, I wish to call attention to one passage which puts our case very strongly with reference to the attitude we took up towards the Boers in the settlement at the time of the conquest of the Transvaal. I refer to Mr. Chamberlain’s telegram in 1901 which will be found in Colonial Paper 528, page 5. Mr. Chamberlain then telegraphed  that  the  legal position of Coloured people will be similar to that which they hold in the Cape Colony. I do not say for a moment that in the complicated relations of the Crown
 with its self-governing Colonies we could not dream of interfering with the political arrangements and power[s] of a Colony; but I do feel that, so long as Colonies claim the protection of the British flag and the support of the British Empire, we have a right to expect that they will grant civil rights, leaving the question of political rights to the discretion of the Colonies.
 ‘Well’ now, perhaps, you may say, ‘how do I propose to enforce this in case of
 a conflict between the central Government and the Colonies?’ I do not say that you can enforce it. These are the problems of intricate relationship with concurrent rights; and though theoretically the Parliament of this country is supreme, practically nobody dreams of this country’s supremacy in face of action by the Colony. In the first place, I do not believe that you will come to that point with a Colony. But if we can tamper with principle year after year, we encourage a base spirit of race supremacy  to assert itself in the Colonies, and you will find it more difficult to tackle it afterwards.     I may point out that, if the worst came to the worst, no Colony could
 complain if exactly the same humiliating restrictions were put upon white colonists going to India as they propose to put upon Indians going to the Colony. If an Australian merchant, for instance, had to live in a particular district, and had to take out a police license, I think many of them would soon realize that the impediments they   are   putting   on   other   British   subjects   were   not   to    be    borne.   I think
 this is important.. .No, I think it is intolerable. I think, myself, that, invariably if we go away from principle, we very soon get involved in great difficulties. I do not say that you can quite act up to principle. I think the English Government cannot: but you should bear the principle in mind and get as near as you can to it.
 I say, in conclusion, that I cannot quite agree with the satisfaction expressed by Sir Lepel Griffin with the assurance that we had from the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Sympathy is a very good thing but effective acts are much better.
 SIR M. M. BHOWNAGGREE: . . . if by your influence, the Cabinet or His Majesty’s Government were to be induced to veto this Ordinance, which the Delegates have come all this way to complain about, well and good. But if His Majesty’s Government find that, between the prejudice subsisting on the part of so-called white men in the Colonies and the rights of the Indians, there is a gulf which they cannot bridge over by their own or your influence, then I beg to support the prayer that a commission may be appointed in order to investigate the whole question and put its conclusions before His Majesty’s Government.    I  am instructed by the  Delegates,
 and I have the authority almost of the whole of the British Indian community resident in the Transvaal and in Africa generally, to say that they will abide by the findings of such a commission. They feel that six, eight, or a dozen impartial English statesmen
 sitting round a table and inquiring into a deep grievance like this cannot possibly go wrong...
 SIR H. COTTON	The people of India follow what is going on in South Africa
 most carefully, and they rely, sir, upon you—you who are the custodian of their liberties and their rights, their sole protector in fact in this country—to see that justice is done to them in whatever part of the globe they may settle.. .
 SIR  LEPEL GRIFFIN:  I  think, sir, that this will be sufficient.	After all, it is  a
 question of principle, and that should not be given up. Indeed, it has been asserted by this Government so strongly in the question of Chinese labour that I think, if the question were deliberately laid in its true facts before the present House of Commons, that they could, so far as consistency has any meaning, answer it only in one manner.
 MR. MORLEY: ...There can be no doubt whatever, I take it—everybody of Indian experience with whom I speak on the subject agrees—that the effect upon public opinion in India is, and naturally is, and must be, rather serious. Those people who go to South Africa come back by and by and represent the indignities to which some of them and their kith and kin have been subjected. That in itself stirs up prejudice. Often the population in India—those who reflect—will ask themselves whether it is want of will or want of power in the British Government to which they submit that leaves them exposed to those disadvantages in a  newly  acquired possession of the British Crown. The irony of the situation of that newly acquired
 possession has been pointed out by more than one speaker, and I was very glad indeed that my friend, Lord Stanley, read Mr. Chamberlain’s telegram of 1901, and that reference has been made to Lord Lansdowne’s well-known speech at Sheffield in the first week or two of the war. Mr. Chamberlain—to his great honour, be it said— throughout the whole time that he was at the Colonial Office urged with all his force the injustice, the harshness, the indignity of proceedings of this kind...
 . . . It is, I repeat, a great irony that one of the first acts to which the eye of the British Government is directed is an Ordinance which, in effect—say what we like about it—along with other practices and habits of mind, does throw a bar sinister upon many millions of British subjects. (‘Hear! Hear!’)
 I am heartily glad, though a responsible Minister is seldom a man who desires an appeal to principle, that Lord Stanley has gone boldly on to that thorny and difficult ground. It is well that we should be reminded that the principles that he alluded to and enforced today have become a little old fashioned; but I share adherence  to them entirely with him. (‘Hear! Hear!’) But now we are—at least I am—in a responsible position, and the question is not what we would desire to do if we had a blank sheet of paper before us; but, as Lord Stanley admitted, we are to keep our principle in mind, and come as near to it as we can in practical applications.
 But, then, what is the position of the India Office? Remember that the department and the Minister, first and immediately, and in a sense finally, concerned is the Minister for the Colonies...I see at once, and I submit to you, gentlemen, a very serious difficulty in the way of a commission, and that is that we hope by May that responsible government is going to be conferred on the people of the Transvaal.  It surely would be a very odd preliminary to putting the reins of government into their hands to send out a commission which, if it is to do anything at all, and, if it is to affect the mind of His Majesty’s Government here, must force His Majesty’s Government to tell the new organized authority that is to be brought into being, what they are or are not to do in this very thorny and difficult field of legislation. Well, I only submit that as my answer to what Mr. Gandhi and Sir M. M. Bhownaggree said. Somebody said, by the way, that a commission would be a solution of the question. Now, I have been a great many years in Parliament, and I wonder what commission ever solved any question. Therefore, I demur to that general proposition, and I demur to the notion of a commission in the present circumstances because it might lead you into immediate collision with this new authority which you have called, or are about to call, into being.
 No doubt the position of the Imperial Government towards a Colony such as the Transvaal is going to be, and such as Natal is, is a great paradox. There is no other word for it. But there it is. You have to accept our present system, miscalled an
 Imperial system. You have to accept that, and you have to recognize this plain fact— and you ought to recognize it—that we cannot dictate to these Colonies. What can we do, and what ought we to do? What I hope is that such gatherings as this Deputation to Lord Elgin and to myself, and perhaps to other Ministers and other persons, will promote this operation. We can plead and argue the case, and press the principles that Lord Stanley has outlined. That is what we can do--whether in the Colonial  Conference next year, or in the form of despatches, to Lord Selborne, for instance. That is what we can do: we can bring to bear the weight of British opinion and British influence upon the responsible bodies in the Transvaal.
 Sir Lepel Griffin noticed that I indicated a little astonishment when he said that I could fasten or unloose these bonds. There is not a single Viceroy now living who has not tried, and tried pretty hard, to get these arrangements, the new form of which you are complaining of today, modified. What Lord Lansdowne thought of them you have already heard. Lord Elgin told you when you saw him that he had sent any number of despatches to this Office—on the way to the Colonial Office, I presume—making the same protest. Lord Curzon, the last Viceroy, carried on a tremendous battle. (‘Hear! Hear!’) I was this morning turning over his speeches, trying to see what he had said or done, and he gives in one of the speeches—his seventh Budget Speech—an account of his attempted dealings with the Government of Natal—in the year 1903, I think. This is what he says. It is very short, so I venture to read it. ‘We stipulated for the eventual abolition of a tax of £3 a head which had been imposed on such persons for leave to reside; we stipulated for the amendment of an Act placing traders, of however old a standing, under the power of local corporations, who had absolute authority to refuse licenses to trade; we stipulated for the removal of Indians from another Act, under which they were  classed  with barbarous races; and for the provision of a summary remedy for free Indians, that is to say, Indians who had served their indenture, and had become free Indians, who might be wrongfully arrested on the ground that they were coolies under indenture or prohibited immigrants’. That was Lord Curzon’s position dealing with the Government of Natal in 1903. What did the Government of Natal say? ‘In reply,’ says Lord Curzon, ‘we were given to understand that there was no prospect of obtaining the consent of the local legislature to these conditions, and the negotiations were dropped.’ It would surely be unwise, and I do not think Sir Lepel Griffin would recommend me to put myself (if I had the authority) in a position of that sort, or that I should write to Lord Elgin a communication which would urge him to put himself into the same position with reference to the new Transvaal Government, when it comes into existence as Lord Curzon was placed in by the established Government  of Natal. . .
 
 As I understand from Mr. Gandhi—and I was delighted to hear it, and perhaps a little surprised, but delighted—the feeling on the part of the white colonists towards the Indians who are now, and have been for some time, resident in the Transvaal is not bad, but rather good than otherwise.
MR. GANDHI: The feeling is bad enough, but it is restricted to the
 petty store-keepers. It is they who agitate, and they who inflame the popular prejudice.
 MR. MORLEY: I understand that, but we must, after all, look at this thing fairly. It is not very unnatural that a small white store-keeper should be very happy if he could so far prevail upon the prejudices of the people as to induce those who are in authority to keep out his formidable competitors, because, of course, we know quite well—it is no secret—that it is not merely prejudice of colour; it is not a prejudice of racial inferiority, because that would be absurd when there are, as we know, Indians in the Transvaal, pursuing professions and so forth, who are not only not inferior but greatly superior in many of the elements that make a civilized being to many of those who are not excluded from the Transvaal. (‘Hear! Hear!’)...
 ...If a foreign power were to impose these disabilities upon fellow-subjects of ours, I think the Foreign Office would be set in motion to represent such a proceeding as an unfriendly act. (‘Hear! Hear!’) It is a disagreeable truth, but we ought to face these things: that there is no doubt we can more effectively remonstrate with foreign powers than we can in some circumstances with our own kinsfolk. (‘Shame!’) But this is carrying me into a very wide field indeed. Lord Stanley, I think, rather tempted me into these speculations. If there is any feeling in India, that, after all, is the only thing that I can do any good by endeavouring to convey. Whatever can be done by way of energetic expression of opinion, of energetic protest, when the time comes, against these harsh and humiliating indignities, you may feel perfectly sure, and they may feel perfectly sure, that this Office will not be at all slack in backing the Colonial Office in any representations that they may wish to make, or possibly even in going a little in front. (‘Hear! Hear!’) Nobody occupying my position could do anything less than promise you, which I do with the greatest sincerity, not only the sympathy of which somebody has spoken today, but as much support as I find myself able to give, now that I am in possession of the general views which you, gentlemen, have so ably laid before me. (Applause.)
 SIR LEPEL GRIFFIN: . . . Mr. Morley, I beg on behalf of the deputation to express our best thanks for the very kind and sympathetic manner in which you have 1istened to us for so long, and for the answer which you have given to us.
 The deputation then withdrew.

    THE 	EDITOR 	SOUTH AFRICA [LONDON]  SIR,  November 	22, 1906 
  	You have laid the British Indian Deputation under deep obligation by 	your opening your columns for a discussion of the British Indian 	position in the Transvaal and, in the words of Lord Milner, it is 	such discussion alone which would bring us nearer to a proper 	solution. In your leaderette, however, you have done less than 	justice to the British Indian community by imputing to it a desire 	forthe franchise and for an Asiatic invasion of the Transvaal. May I 	state that the community has never desired any political power in 	the Transvaal or an invasion of it by British Indians, and it is for 	that reason that it has accepted legislation along the Cape or the 	Natal model, which restricts the immigration of British Indians 	(except those who enjoy a status) without insulting them. The 	community has also accepted the principle of the control of all new 	trade licences, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court, by local 	boards or municipalities.  	The objection to the Asiatic Law Amendment  Ordinance  is taken not 	because the Ordinance is restrictive of immigration, but because it 	is restrictive of the ordinary civil liberty of the British Indians 	who are today domiciled in the Transvaal. It is not the present 	Ordinance which would restrict Indian immigration; as you are aware, 	the Peace Preservation Ordinance has been misapplied for effecting 	that purpose.  	You say that Indians cannot be treated better than natives of South 	Africa. Without entering into a discussion of the proposition, may I 	inform you that they are being treated worse than the Natives, in 	that, whereas Natives can become owners of landed property in any 	part of the Transvaal, Indians cannot own it at all.  I 	am, Yours etc.,  M. K. GANDHI  South 	Africa, 24-11-1906 "

     DEAR 	MR. MORISON,  November 	22, 1906 
  	I now enclose herewith a cutting with marked passages, giving the 	utterances of Lord Selborne. One was before the war and the other 	only lately.  	I also send you copy of Sir Muncherji’s letter to Mr. Lyttelton, 	with the passages marked.  	That we would be satisfied with legislation along the Cape lines is 	made, you will notice, quite clear in the Representation to Lord 	Elgin of which you have a copy and of which if you need I will send 	you more copies. I hope you have noticed the fundamental objection 	to the Asiatic Ordinance, namely, that it draws forlibtech_214_footnotethe first  time  a colour line and it means a 	departure from the Colonial tradition. If there was no hesitation 	last year in vetoing the Native Land TenureBill,  it passes 	comprehension why there should be any hesitation about vetoing this 	Ordinance which is infinitely worse than the  Native  Tenure 	Ordinance.

We were very well received. Mr. Morley was strong in some parts of his speech but I cannot say that the effect on the whole was encouraging. However, we have to wait and see.
Mr. Ally and I leave definitely on the 1st of next month.

  November 	23, 1906 This 	is our last week here. We had hoped to leave on November   But 		we have 		been obliged to stay 		on in order 		to complete 		the work 		regarding the 		Committee and do 		whatever is necessary 		after the interview 		with Mr. Morley. Now we have fixed 		the date of 		our departure 		for December 1.   MORE 	PROMISES 	OF HELP  	During the current week, we met Lord Milner, Mr. Lyttelton, Lord 	Reay, Sir Raymond West and others. Everyone has shown much sympathy 	and offered to work for us. It is not possible to say what the 	outcome of all this will be.  INTERVIEW 	WITH 	SECRETARY 	OF STATE 	FOR INDIA  	The deputation met Mr. Morley, the Secretary of State for India, on 	Thursday at 12.20 p.m. Those present were Sir Lepel Griffin, Lord 	Stanley of Alderley, Sir Charles Dilke, Sir Charles Schwann, Sir 	William Wedderburn, Sir Henry Cotton, Sir Muncherji Bhownaggree, Dr. 	Rutherford, Mr. Harold Cox, Mr. A. H. Scott, Mr. Lynch, Mr. F. H. 	Brown, Mr. J. D. Rees, Mr. Thornton, Mr. Arathoon, Mr. Dadabhai 	Naoroji, Mr. T. J. Bennett, Mr. Theodore Morison and Mr. Ritch. Mr. 	Ameer Ali could not attend owing to illness. Sir Lepel Griffin, Lord 	Stanley, Mr. Cox and Sir Muncherji spoke at length. Lord Stanley 
 went so far as to demand sweet deeds in place of sweet words. Messrs Ally and Gandhilibtech_215_footnotesaid whatever was required on the occasion.
 MORLEY’S SPEECH
Mr. Morley gave a long reply in which he said:
 I am glad to have met the deputation. For I desire to be familiarized fully with the condition of the country for whose administration I am responsible to Parliament. Moreover, the problem placed before me today has a very close bearing on the good government of India. That the feelings of the people of India are excited on account of the disabilities imposed upon Indians in South Africa is a serious matter. Indians returning to their native land from South Africa carry with them the story of the indignities to which they are subjected, and the result is that people are greatly agitated. People in India must be thinking that the Government lack either the will or the power to prevent oppression in South Africa. In either case, it is harmful. I believe the resistance offered by Mr. Chamberlain in 1901, in the interests of Indians, deserves praise. The first thing that has been brought to the notice of the new Government is that  a  bar sinister has been placed upon Indians in some Colonies. Men in authority do not like to be told about moral principles. But I am glad that Lord Stanley has spoken of moral principles. The views expressed by Lord Stanley may be held by some to be old fashioned, but I for one share them entirely. Unfortunately, we have not a white sheet of paper to write upon. We must face the facts as they are and then act, as far as possible, in accordance with moral principle. Now, let us see what the India Office can do. It has been recognized by Sir Lepel Griffin that the minister primarily concerned is Lord Elgin. Sir Muncherji asks me to demand that a commission be appointed. But a serious difficulty in the way is that in May next the Transvaal will be under responsible government. Now it would be a serious matter if a conflict arises between the [policies of the] new government and
 
 the commission’s recommendations. I do not believe that such a commission will solve the question. I have been in Parliament for many years but I do not remember any commission which has solved any question. And the question regarding the Transvaal is not likely to be solved by the appointment of a commission. It will quite probably mean a collision with the newly organized government at the very outset of its career. The plain fact is that we cannot dictate to  the  self-governing colonies. We can plead, we can argue, we can press for the application of our principles. Whether at the Colonial  Conference [next year] or in his despatches, Lord Elgin will, doubtless, advance strong arguments and make recommendations. Viceroy after Viceroy has written on the matter. Lord Curzon had written very strongly. He had made many recommendations about Natal but Natal paid no heed to his words. It remains to be seen whether the Transvaal will listen to the requests of Lord Elgin. I am glad to know that there are many whites in the Transvaal who are not against Indians. I can well understand the small white shopkeepers opposing them. I can even understand Indians [already in the country] opposing [further immigration of Indians].libtech_216_footnotelibtech_217_footnoteBut what I cannot understand is the prejudice felt by the whites against mere dark skin. I know that there are in the Transvaal many [Indians] who are superior to the whites. How can these then be tyrannized over? Just as Lord Lansdowne’s feelings were hurt by the treatment meted out to Indians, my blood too boils at their sufferings. But it must be remembered that we cannot remonstrate as effectively with the Colonies as we can with foreign powers. But I have been tempted into a digression by the remarks of Lord Stanley. All I can now say is that it is my duty to do all I can. The India Office will not fail to make strong representations as frequently as may be necessary. I can definitely assure you that I shall not be slack in supporting the Colonial Office and, possibly, going ahead of it.
 
 “Deputation to Morley”, 22-11-1906
 MORE INTERVIEWS AND SYMPATHY
 Though Mr. Morley has made such a strong speech, I do not yet expect that the Ordinance will be refused assent. Strong despatches seem to have been received from the Transvaal. I feel also that the rulers here think in their heart of hearts that we are an inferior race and there is no harm in piling up endless burdens on us. Today we saw Mr. Lyttelton and also Sir Raymond Westlibtech_218_footnote, an ex-Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court. They appeared to be of much the same view. They felt much sympathy, but they also indicated that we would get no redress until we acquired strength like the whites. They are afraid of the colonies, not because they are white, but because they are powerful. If this is a true reading of the situation, we should realize that our salvation lies in our own hands.
 OUR DELIVERANCE
 While we are on this subject, the case of Miss Milne deserves to be noted. Miss Milne, a suffragette, began making a speech in front of the Houses of Parliament. The police attempted to stop her, but she persisted. She was then arrested and prosecuted. The Magistrate sentenced her to pay a fine of 10s or imprisonment for seven days. The brave lady preferred to go to gaol.
 This will be our last letter from England. Hence I would appeal to all and say that, just as Miss Milne preferred going to gaol, so must every Transvaal Indian, taking it that the Ordinance will receive Royal assent. There is no doubt that the Fourth Resolution contains the key to the Indians’ deliverance. If the Resolution is acted upon, there should be no anxiety, whether or not the Ordinance receives  the  assent.

 I have seen in The Times what purports to be a report of the proceedings of the deputation that waited on Mr. John Morley yesterday. Several pressmen came to me yesterday and I told them that the proceedings were private and such intimation had appeared in The Daily Mail and The Tribune. I do not know how The Times has been able to get the report.

In   my      MR. 	CHURCHILL: 	My attention has been drawn to the provision referred to. This land 	was originally granted to poor burghers—that is, to white men 	onlt, and on condition of personal occupation. The Ordinance, 	therefore, merely perpetuates the legal conditions which were in 	existence before annexation, and in defiance of which certain 	Indians have, I understand, acquired some Stands and erected tin 	shanties. I may add that it is very desirable to keep the white and 	Coloured quarters apart, as the practice of allowing European, 	Asiatic, and Native families to live side by side in mixed community 	is fraught with many evils, and is, in Lord Selborne’s opinion, 	injurious to the social well-being of all three. The whole question 	is, however, still under consideration. 
 humble opinion the answer is based on a misapprehension of the real state of affairs.
 The act of granting Vrededorp to the poor Dutch burghers for personal occupation was accompanied by occupation of Vrededorp by persons other than the grantees irrespective of race or colour. As for instance, many non-Dutch white people occupied Stands in Vrededorp from the original grantees with the knowledge of the Boer Government.
 The Ordinance does not perpetuate the legal conditions which were in existence before annexation, because the legal condition  before annexation was that the grantees had only squatters’ rights. The Ordinance now gives to them a permanent tenure with power to them to transfer their leases to whomsoever they choose save and except Asiatics so that the legal condition of personal occupation is now being changed into that of transferable leases.
 I venture to protest against the statement that Indians acquired rights in Vrededorp in defiance of legal conditions. They acquired rights in Vrededorp in the same manner that those who were not poor burghers did. Nor is it true that Indians have erected shanties in Vrededorp. In my humble opinion, class considered, what are descri- bed as shanties are superior to many of the buildings in Vrededorp.
 If the doctrine of the desirability of keeping the white and the Coloured quarters apart is sound, I fear that there will be an end to British Indian residence in the Transvaal with any degree of self- respect. The logical conclusion of such a doctrine will be a system of Locations which can only result in ruination to hundreds of law- abiding and respectable Indians.
 One is appalled by the inaccurate information that is placed before His Lordship in connection with matters Indian and it is extremely painful that legislation that is otherwise without the slightest justification is justifiedon statements that are inaccurate or misleading.
 In venturing to offer the above remarks, no reflection is cast on Lord Selborne but it is respectfully submitted that Lord Selborne himself receives misleading information, as is painfully apparent to those   who   are   on   the   spot    and   know    the    inner   working  of
 the administration.

 THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO THE RT. HON. JOHN MORLEY
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA DOWNING STREET
 SIR,
 
We shall be obliged if you will kindly bring the following to Mr.
Morley’s notice.
 From what Mr. Morley stated yesterday there seems to be an impression that the Right Hon’ble gentleman believes that the Indian “petition” from the Transvaal is in approval of the Ordinance, which is not the case as will appear from the detailed replylibtech_224_footnotethe Delegates have submitted to Lord Elgin. We now enclose herewith copy thereof.
 With reference to the Royal Commission, what the Delegates have requested is a commission or rather a committee—it may be of local, but independent and impartial men, such as the judges of the Supreme Court or the Chief Magistrate of Johannesburg to enquire into the charges made against the Indian community and
 
 which have been used as reasons for passing the Ordinance. In our humble opinion, such a committee can give its report within a month from its formation. The Delegates respectfully submit that either the veto should now be exercised, as in the case of the  Native  Land  Tenure Ordinance, or the Royal sanction should be  suspended,  pending result of the investigations by the committee or the commission described above.
 British Indians in the Transvaal ask for full protection for the resident Indian population and that, in our humble opinion, should be granted to them, irrespective of the Colonial sentiment.
 We have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servants,

 Mr. 	Ally and I have taken the liberty of sending you today an    
 invitation card for breakfast on Thursday next at 10.30 at Hotel Cecil as a small token of the gratitude of the Indian community, whom we have the honour to represent, for your valuable support and sympathy. I trust that you will be able to accept the invitation. I am aware that the notice given is very short but as it is imperatively necessary for the Delegates to leave for South Africa next Saturday, we could not give a longer notice.
 I beg to enclose herewith, for your suggestions, the draft constitution of the South Africa British Indian Committee which you have kindly joined. After the breakfast is over, it has been suggested that a brief conference should take place in order to consider any suggestions that may be made in connection with the draft.
 As the Committee has been formed in obedience to instructions received from South Africa, the Delegates have taken the liberty of approaching Sir Muncherji for acceptance of the Chairmanship of the sub-Committee. We have done so because we feel that, among the friends of the cause in London, no one has  studied  the  Indian question in South Africa so well as Sir Muncherji, he having actively interested himself in the cause for the last 12 years and having made a speciality of this question. Sir Muncherji has very kindly consented to accept the office if it also meets with the approval of  the  other members of the sub-Committee.
 Lord Reay has been approached with a view to the acceptance of the Presidentship of the Committee and if it is at all possible for His Lordship to accept the office, he will do so.

 November 26, 1906
 . . . Mr. Gandhi said that after what had been said by the lecturer it was unnecessary to say anything further with reference to the object of the mission with which he had been entrusted, but it would be ungrateful on his part if he did not take the opportunity of expressing his deep gratitude to the East India Association and its secretary, Mr. G. W. Arathoon, for the advocacy which the Indian cause in South Africa had received. There was one thing which all should bear in mind, namely, that whatever difficulties they were undergoing in South Africa were being undergone in the name of the English people [sic], more particularly in the Transvaal. The Ordinance which had brought them to England had been introduced in the name of the King.
 For the first time in Colonial history, a precedent had been set by a Crown Colony of legislation which branded a class of people simply because they wore a coloured skin. Was India to be retained, or was India to be lost simply because Colonial sentiment had to be consulted? What was the proportion of the white population to the Indian?
 Mr. Ritch had said, the Asiatics in the Transvaal were but a drop in the Ocean
 —13,000 as against 285,000 white men. They were simply struggling for peace, for contentment and self-respect in that Colony. Nearly all of them entered the Colony before the war. Today they were merely asking for the civil rights which ought to be granted to everybody who was a subject under the British Crown, and yet under the Ordinance they were to be treated differently to other British subjects. Was that kind of legislation to be sanctioned in the name of the British nation? (Applause.)...

 DEAR MADAM,
 I shall be obliged if you will kindly inform me whether you know anything suitable for a young Indian 18 years of age who requires school education as distinguished from college education and parental supervision. In my, opinion, he has in him the making of an exceedingly fine, strong and lovable character. What I want is a place
 where he can receive education enabling him to pass the Matriculation examination of London University. His means are limited. He is not in a position to spend more than £8 per month including everything.
 I am, Yours truly,

    MY 	LORD,  November 	27, 1906 
  	Mr. Ally and I have arrived, as perhaps Your Lordship is aware, as a 	Deputation on behalf of the British Indian community in the 	Transvaal.  	We have waited on Lord Elgin and Mr. Morley who have given 	sympathetic answers with reference to our mission but we also feel 	that any representations that they may make in our behalf require to 	be considerably strengthened. Moreover, the support that we have 	received from all parties has been exceptionally warm. We are most 	anxious to make as much use as possible of it in our future 	struggle. We have further been instructed by the British Indians in 	South Africa  	to form a committee, so that the work now being done may be 	continued. We 	enclose herewith copy of the constitution.  	We have approached the Right Hon’ble Lord Reay with a view to his 	acceptance of the Presidentship of the Committee and  we believe 	that, if you could see your way to lend the weight of your influence 	to the Committee by accepting a Vice-Presidentship, he will accept 	the Presidentship and Your Lordship will lay the Indian community in 	South Africa under deep obligation to you.  	We beg to enclose herewith an invitation card to a complime- ntary 	breakfast we are giving on Thursday next at 10.30 a.m. If Your 	Lordship could honour the occasion by your presence at the break- 	fast, we would feel deeply grateful. Lord Reay has kindly consented 	to come a little after the breakfast to attend a short conference 	that will take place thereafter to discuss the constitution of the 	Committee.

 I will feel very much obliged if you will kindly come on Thursday at 10.30. I do not think I need trouble you tomorrow. Mr. Winston Churchill has given us an appointment for tomorrow.
 You will perhaps be going to the Bank tomorrow to give your signature as President of the sub-Committee and one of the signatories to the cheques and if at that time it is not too much trouble, you will perhaps drop in at the Hotel.
We had a very satisfactory interview with the Editor of The Daily
 News.
I have not told you all about Mr. Ritch’s capabilities. He has
 handled many a meeting and has been secretary of more than one organization. He was twenty years ago perhaps what people may call a rabid Socialist. His has been a most chequered career. Today, I do not own a friend who knows me more than he does. He is one of those men who believe in dying for a cause that he [sic] holds dear.

 [ENCLOSURE]
 OBJECTIONS TO THE VREDEDORP STANDS ORDINANCE
   The 		Ordinance if sanctioned 		will be a precedent 		for the inclusion 		of class-disqualifying 		clauses in leases 		in other 		townships in 		Johannesburg or 		the Transvaal 		and would 		therefore go 		beyond the 		Law 3 of 1885 in 		restricting British 		Indian rights.  British 		Indians with the 		knowledge of 		the Boer 		Government occupied 		and built 		upon Stands in 		Vrededorp just 		as many other Europeans 		did who were 		not the original 		burghers who received, 		from the 		late President Kruger, squatters’ rights on the Stands.  Vrededorp 		is contiguous to 		the Malay Location, 		which is inhabited by 		a very large number of 		British Indians.  The 		Ordinance does 		not perpetuate 		the legal 		condition that 		was in 		existence before 		the war but it 		gives permanent 		rights to 		the original 		burghers with 		the power to sublet. 		Under this 		 power, Europeans 		who were 		not burghers 		would be 		able to 		retain the 		rights granted 		to them 		by the 		burghers whereas 		British Indians will 		be dispossessed without the slightest justification.  Premises 		built by 		British Indians 		are not 		shanties but 		substantial structures 		as good 		as most 		other buildings.  If 		the Ordinance 		is sanctioned, 		it will 		be the 		first instance of 		a recognition by 		an Imperial Government 		of the 		right of 		a municipality 		to curtail 		the residential 		rights of 		British Indians in 		any part of 		the Transvaal 		which, under a Supreme 		Court judgment, British Indians are 		entitled to. It will 		indirectly create 		a system of Locations 		which otherwise the 		Imperial Government, 		it is presumed, would 		never sanction.

 The following is a report of Gandhiji’s speech at the farewell breakfast given at Hotel Cecil by the Delegates from the Transvaal to friends and sympathizers:
 [HOTEL CECIL,
 LONDON,
 November 29, 1906]
 Sir Muncherji, My Lord and Gentlemen, before I begin to express our thanks for your attendance here and to those gentlemen who have not been able to attend this morning, I shall take the opportunity of reading some of the letterslibtech_238_footnotelibtech_239_footnotewhich have been received in connection with the invitations.
 The task before my colleagues and myself today is an exceedingly pleasant one---to thank you all who have honoured us by your presence, and also to thank those gentlemen who could not be with us this morning. Mr. Ally and I, when we came to the end of our mission, thought that the least we could do, as representing the 13,000 British Indians in the Transvaal, was to adopt this tangible method of showing our gratitude. The support we have received throughout our stay in England has been very encouraging. We have received it from all parties ever since the beginning of our campaign against the deprivation of our civil rights as citizens in this mighty Empire. We have appealed to all parties, and all parties have invariably extended their help to us. For this we cannot be too grateful, and I think it but right especially to mention the name of the late Sir William Wilson Hunter. As far back as 1893, Sir W. W. Hunter received one of the circulars sent out to him from South Africa, and he it was, I think, who first understood the national importance of this question, and ever since that time down to  the date of  his death, he  was  always  busy

 doing something or other to assist the cause of British Indians in South Africa. In the columns of The Times and otherwise, he always advocated our cause, and I had a letter from Lady Hunter saying that, even at the time of his death, he had a  long  contribution  in preparation in connection with this matter. In 1896, when I was in Calcutta, the late Mr. Saunders also came to the assistance of our cause, as also did The Times of India, which paper has always advocated the cause of the British Indians in South Africa. Coming nearer, the East India Association has helped us, and the British Committee of the Indian National Congress has given us valuable assistance. It is a matter of regret to both Mr. Ally and myself that we have had to issue this invitation just at the time the “Grand Old Man” of India,-Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, is leaving this country for the forthcoming session of the Congress. To him also we owe a debt of gratitude. As I have said, we have appealed to all parties in the House of Commons, and all have helped us. I must not fail to mention especially the name of Mr. Scott, who has helped us most sympatheti- cally and most energetically in connection with our grievances, and now I come to the name of Sir Mancherji Bhownaggree. For the last 12 years, he has persistently and with unflagging zeal been advocating the cause of British Indians in South Africa. All have helped, but Sir Mancherji has made this cause his own. Sir Mancherji has worked as if he were actuated by the same strong convictions and feelings as we ourselves. He has felt as no other man has the national importance of the issues involved. In the House of Commons, outside the House, in his correspondence, he has always helped and counselled us as to how we were to go to work, and words cannot express our gratitude to him for all he has done for us in South Africa. The difficulties in our path have, perhaps, whether this Ordinance be passed or not, only just commenced. We, therefore, hope that the support, which  all  our friends here have hitherto afforded us, will be maintained, because, even if the Ordinance is disallowed—as there is some hope it will be— there is still a great deal to be done in regard to the general question. There is again the Vrededorp Ordinance. There is, too, the Natal Municipal Corporations Bill. Whatever is done in the Transvaal is likely to be done by the other Colonies. Ours has been a policy of the strictest moderation. We have always claimed that we have been able to enter into the feelings of our opponents (if one may use that term) in South Africa, and although we have examined the whole question from their standpoint and have always endeavoured to convince those
 
 who are prejudiced against us of our desire to be moderate, we have still to ask you to extend your support to us in our struggle, and it is for this reason that we have been authorized by the British Indians in South Africa to organize and inaugurate such a committee as will always watch over our interests. The work that has been so well and ably performed here by our supporters will have been frittered away if it be not now concentrated and continued by means of such an organization as thisCommittee.
 As most of you gentlemen have received copies of the circularlibtech_240_footnote, I will only recapitulate the objects of the Committee. You will notice that it is merely a provisional draft. These are the ideas as they strike us, and we hope that you will consider them, and help us by your counsels. All whose names are printed on the draft have kindly consented to become members of the Committee, and it now only remains for me to ask you kindly to consider the draft constitution, and to formally inaugurate it, if you think that the step we have ventured to take is acceptable to you. I cannot better illustrate the gravity of the position in which we are placed in the Transvaal than by pointing to the young British Indians who are here today. They are more your hosts than guests. They are Indian students who belong to South Africa, that is to say, South Africa is more their home than India itself. They are studying here, but I have no doubt they are looking forward to their return to South Africa with considerable anxiety and apprehension, because they will have to share the same fate as the thirteen thousand British Indians in the Transvaal, and in fact all the British Indians in South Africa. Here, in England, they will become barristers or doctors, but there, in South Africa, they may not even be able to cross the border of the Transvaal.

    DEAR 	MR. POLAK,  November 	29, 1906 
  	After all, I think that Ruthnum should, at least for the present, go 	to the Van Weenen’s. The Bedford County School won’t havehim by 	reason of his being overage. I have had no time to look up any other 	institution. He must leave India House at the earliest opportunity. 	If therefore the Van Weenen’s are prepared still to accept him, 	will you kindly arrange so that Ruthnum can leave for Westcliffe on 	Monday? I would like Miss Weenen to give him all the education she 	is capable of giving him. Perhaps she can also secure a private 	tutor or admission for him to a school or class in Westcliffe. Under 	the above proposal, Ruthnum Pather need not take out a railway 	season ticket as he would be going to town only six days every term. 	I would like Miss Weenen to treat him as a member of the family, to 	be perfectly frank and open with him and never to hesitate to point 	out to Ruthnum his defects either in speech, in manner or in mode of 	living. He should in short be treated as a very young lad and 	receive loving supervision. He has in him the making[s] of a very 	good man if at the impressionable time of his life he receives 	proper handling. You 	may, if you like, pass on this letter to Miss Van Weenen.

    TO  THE 	EDITOR 	THE TIMES [LONDON]  SIR,  November 30, 1906libtech_244_footnote 
  	On the eve of the departure of the Indian Deputation from the 	Transvaal, may we trespass upon your courtesy to allow us to offer 	our thanks to the many supporters of the British Indian cause who 	have rendered us their valuable assistance in putting our case 	before the Imperial Government and the British public. The unfailing 	cour- tesy we have experienced from gentlemen representing different 	shades of opinion, from all parties, and from the Press has been a 	source of keenest satisfaction to us and has inspired us with a new 	hope. Our brief stay in London has prevented us from personally 	waiting on all whom we should have liked to meet. We have, however, 	received support and sympathy even from them.  	The lesson we have drawn from the above is that we may rely upon the 	British sense of fair play and justice and that the cause we have 	the honour to espouse is absolutely just. May we restate it in a few 	words We ask for no political power in the Transvaal. We do not 	strive for unrestricted immigration of British Indians, but we do 	respectfully and emphatically claim the ordinary rights of 	citizenship forthose who are     
 already in the country namely, free-dom of ownership of land, freedom of locomotion, freedom of trade, subject to such requirements as may be necessary in the interests of the community as a whole. In short, the British Indians in the Transvaal claim the right to live in the Transvaal with self-respect and dignity. The Indian community protests against any class distinction being made, and it has exerted itself against the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, because it violates in the most brutal manner the principles above laid down. In our humble opinion we feel that if we cannot secure for our countrymen, whom we have the honour to represent, the  above measure of recognition, the term “British Indian” becomes an empty platitude and“Empire” ceases to have any meaning for the British Indian. In coming to England and laying our case before the Home Govern-ment, we have no desire to offer violent opposition to the European Colonists in the Transvaal. Ours is wholly a defensive attitude. When the local Govern-ment, in the name of the people of the Transvaal, sends to the Imperial Government for assent a piece of offensive legislationlibtech_245_footnotelibtech_246_footnoteto protect and accentuate colour prejudice, we are obliged, in self-defence, to lay before the same Government the Indian side of the question. We are anxious and willing to work out our own salvation by our conduct, and by showing to the Colonists that their interests are also our interests and that our goal is  the  common advancement of them and us. We cannot do this if we do not get breathing time, by reason of the anti-Indian prejudice of the few being crystallized into and receiving the hallmark of legislation under the King’s Sign Manual.
 We are,

 THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES LONDON]
 DEAR SIR,
 I have been so much over-worked night and day that I have not been able before now to submit my promised statementlibtech_247_footnoteon Natal to His Lordship. I allowed it to be crowded out as Mr. Tatham’s Bill was rejected by the Natal Parliament.
 I have now forwarded to Mr. Ritch, the Secretary of the South Africa British Indian Committee, my statement and asked him to have it typed and then present the original with a typed copy to you for submission to Lord Elgin.
I duly received your letter with enclosures for which I thank
 
 you.            From 	a photostat of the original: C. O. 179, Vol. 239/Ind.    I 	remain, Yours faithfully,  M. K. GANDHI 
 [ENCLOSURE]
 STATEMENT REGARDING BRITISH INDIAN POSITION IN NATALlibtech_248_footnote
  I 	shall venture to 	deal with only the 	most important and 	pressing portion of 	the question. 
 THE IMMIGRATION ACT
  Under 	this Act an undoubted 	injustice is done 	to  British Indian 	merchants in 	that they are 	not allowed to 	import confidential 	clerks or domestic servants.  The 	result is 	that a 	monopoly is 	created among the 	few clerks and servants.  Nor 	is it possible 	to command 	a large 	supply of confidential 	clerks from those who 	are already domiciled in 	the Colony.  Confidential 	clerks as a rule 	and domestic 	servants invariably lack ability to satisfy the educational test under the Immigration Act.  It 	is not contended 	that such 	men should be 	allowed to possess 	rights of domicile 	but it 	is respectfully 	submitted that they 	ought to 	be allowed to 	enter the Colony 	to reside 	therein temporarily 	subject to 	guarantee being 	given that, at the 	end of their 	service with their masters, they 	should quit the Colony. 
 DEALERS’ LICENSES ACT
  This 	Act has caused and 	continues to 	cause the gravest mischief. 	British Indian merchants are 	totally at the mercy of 	the licensing 	officers whose decisions 	are not capable 	of being 	reviewed by 	the Supreme Court.  Under 	this Act most 	respectable Indian 	merchants of 	long standing have 	been deprived of 	their licences to 	trade i.e., of 	their vested 	rights. This 	happened in 	the case 	of Messrs 	Dada Osman and 	Hoondamal.  At 	one time 	an arbitrary 	use of 	their power by 	the licensing 	officers created a 	scandal. Mr. 	Chamberlain sent 	a strong 	despatch and 	the then 	ministry in 	Natal addressed a 	circular letterlibtech_249_footnoteto the 	municipalities of Natal 	that, unless they 	exercised reasonably, 	moderately and 	with due regard for 	vested rights, the 	power given to them, 	the Act would have to be 	amended so 	as to restore the 	inherent jurisdiction of 	the Supreme Court. 
 
  It 	is submitted that 	the right of 	the Supreme 	Court to review 	the decisions of 	licensing officers 	should be 	restored at 	the earliest 	opportunity unless 	the Indian 	traders are to 	lose all 	they have in 	the Colony.  The 	late Mr. 	Escombe in his latter 	days deplored 	the deprivation 	of the 	right of 	approaching the 	Supreme Court 	in appeal 	against decisions of 	licensing officers. 
 MUNICIPALITIES BILL
  The 	attempt to 	deprive the 	Indian ratepayers 	of the 	right to 	exercise the 	municipal franchise is 	held to 	be totally unjustifiable 	and wantonly insulting.  It 	is debatable whether 	India possesses 	representative institutions 	founded on the 	Parliamentary franchise. 	But it 	is not open 	to question 	as to the 	municipal franchise.  Both 	the late 	Sir John 	Robinson and 	the late Mr. 	Escombe said 	emphatically that 	the Indian community 	ought not to 	be deprived of 	the municipal franchise.libtech_250_footnote  The 	moral effect of 	sanctioning such 	legislation will be very 	serious and 	the Indians will 	be further 	degraded in the 	estimation of 	the Colonists. 
 CONCLUSION
  It 	now only 	remains for 	me to add 	that regarding 	Natal the 	remedy is 	absolutely in 	the hands of 	the Imperial 	Government. [The] 	prosperity of Natal 	is dependent on 	a continuance 	of indentured labour from India. Natal 	cannot be allowed 	to draw 	upon India for a 	supply of 	indentured labour 	when she 	refuses to 	treat the resident 	Indian population with 	justice and decency.

186,"December 3, 1906",LETTER TO PROFESSOR GOKHALE,"
    
 R. M. S. BRITON,
 December 3, 1906
 DEAR PROF. GOKHALE,
 I am on way back to Johannesburg. I wrote to you  from London.libtech_251_footnoteSir Muncherji suggests that there should be in India a separate South Africa British Indian Committee in the same way as in London. By this time you probably know all about the London Committee. If a committee were formed in India, I have no doubt all parties would unite. Mr. Bennett told me that Mr. Fraser of The Times [of India] would help willingly. Many members of the Chamber of Commerce too may unite and the Aga Khan will certainly do so. If some such organisation be formed, it will do most effective work.
 The importance of the question was fully realized by everyone in London. I am aware that Sir Pherozeshawlibtech_252_footnotedoes not see eye to eye with us in this matter but I venture to think that he is mistaken. Anyhow if a committee were formed, even if it did not do much good, it could not do harm. In order to have a committee you certainly need some local man with an accurate knowledge of the position in South Africa. As to that I can make no suggestion.
       [PS.]         Please 	write to me Box 6522, Johannesburg.  I 	remain, Yours truly,  M. K. GANDHI "
187,"December 18, 1906",RITCH’S SPEECH AT EAST INDIA ASSOCIATIONlibtech_253_footnote,"
  From 	a photostat of the original in Gandhiji’s hand: G. N. 2246         	[Before December 18, 1906] A  paper on  “The 	Burden of  British Indians in South Africa” was 	read by  Mr. L.  W.  Ritch at  the Caxton Hall on   November 26      
 last, under the auspices of the East India Association. Sir Mun-cherjee Bhownaggree was in the chair. Among those present were Lord Reay, Sir Raymond West, Sir Frederick Tyler, Sir George Birdwood Mr. Cotton, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Brown, Mr. Morison and Mr. Arathoon. Professor Parmanand and Mr. Mukerjee were among the Indians present. The speech described in detail the condition [of Indians] all over South Africa. As most of the points made by Mr. Ritch are already known to the readers of this journal, I shall not summarize the speech here.
 After Mr. Ritch had read his paper, the chairman called upon Messrs Gandhi and Ally to speak on the subject. Mr. Gandhi acknowledged with gratitude the help rendered by the East India Association to the cause of British Indians in South Africa and warned the assembly that, if the new act were passed, the responsibility would lie squarely on every Englishman. For, whatever laws were enacted in South Africa they were made in the name of the King Emperor. If therefore the British people were at all inclined to do justice to the three hundred millions in India, they should ensure that the hardships of Indians in the Colonies were ended.
 Mr. Ally spoke next and supported Mr. Gandhi’s argument. He pointed out that alien peoples such as Armenians were free to enter the Transvaal, while the Indians were subjected to various kinds of disabili-ties. This should happen no more.
 Sir Raymond West said that, listening to Mr. Ritch’s speech and the information given by the Delegates, he felt ashamed. Was the duty of England over once self-government had been granted to the Colony? If that were so, the term “Imperial race” ceased to have meaning and should no more be used. Self-government for a Colony did not give it the right to trample upon the non-whites. The Indians had a good cause, and with patience they were bound to get their grievances redressed.
 Mr. Thornton pleaded strongly for justice being done to Indians in the Transvaal. He said that nothing could be more modest than the demands put forward by them, and they admitted of no dispute.
 Mr. Nusserwanjee Cooper, Editor of The Parsee Chronicle, said that he had travelled in British Guiana and had found the Indians there quite happy. They enjoyed all the rights and many of them had risen to high positions. The Indians in South Africa should have the same rights and privileges. That they had to suffer hardships was gross
 injustice.
 Mr. Wise, a planter from Ceylon, took exception to Mr. Ritch’s censure of indentured labour. They went there of their own free will, and it was not for others to say anything about it. Mr. Wise was followed by Mr. Martin Wood, Sir Leslie Probyn and others.
 Replying to questions, Mr. Ritch said that, if one had to choose between doing the right thing by the Indians and losing the Colonies, it would be any day better to let the Colonies go. But to deny justice to the Indians would be a matter of shame to the British people.
 Winding up the discussion, Sir Muncherji said that he had been thinking of the problem for many years and that he could not stand the hardships imposed upon the Indians in South Africa. Sir Raymond West had counselled patience, but he himself held there was no longer any room for patience. Where was the scope for patience when Indians were actually being deprived of their rights?
 Before the meeting dispersed, a resolution expressing sympathy with the British Indians in South Africa was moved by Miss Winterbottom, the Secretary of the Union of Ethical Societies, and was passed. With a vote of thanks to Mr. Ritch, the proceedings came to a close.

188,"December 18, 1906",DEPUTATION NOTES–IV,"
    
 [Before December 18, 1906]
 Their work completed, the Delegates left England by the same mail-ship which carries this letter. In fact, this note is being written on board the steamer.
 The last week will abide in our memory for ever. Every moment strengthened our confidence that the mission on which the Delegates went to England would succeed.
 SECOND MEETING OF M. P’S.
 After Mr. Morley’s reply, the Members of Parliament became more alert. They thought that, if the Royal assent were given to the Ordinance, England’s prestige would suffer. They therefore decided to hold another meeting. Sir Charles Schwann, Mr. Cox and Mr. Scott busied themselves with this work. They asked us to issue circulars for
 the meeting. These were got ready and despatched overnight. The meeting took place on Monday; and the Members resolved to wait upon the Prime Minister and speak to him about the Ordinance. A committee was appointed and it met Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. The Prime Minister said that he did not approve of the Ordinance, and that he would speak to Lord Elgin on the matter. This provided the first reason for entertaining the hope of which we have spoken.
 INTERVIEW WITH CHURCHILL
 We met Mr. Winston Churchill at the time fixed by him. He spoke nicely. He asked both of us whether we were not afraid of res- ponsible government in case the Ordinance were refused assent. What if a worse act were to be passed by the new Government? We replied that we could not imagine an act worse than the present Ordinance,libtech_254_footnoteand that we had asked for refusal of assent leaving the future to take care of itself. He then asked us to send him a brief note, covering, say, a foolscap sheet, of all that we had to say on this Ordinance, on the Vrededorp Stands Ordinance’ and on the question as a whole. He would read and consider it. Mr. Ally then reminded him that he was the same person who had been present at the Point to receive Mr. Churchill on his return from the warlibtech_255_footnote. And it was with the same Mr. Churchill  that  he  now  pleaded  for  redress  on  behalf  of  the   Indian community. Mr. Churchill smiled, patted Mr. Ally on the back and said that he would do all he could. This answer added to our hopes. The brief account asked for by Mr. Churchill has already been sent to him.
 INTERVIEW TO “THE DAILY NEWS”
 The name of the Editor is Gardiner. When we repeated  the whole story for his benefit, he promised to write strongly on the subject, and a poignant article was published the following day.
 PARTY TO WELL-WISHERS
 The Delegates may be said to have done the last bit of their work on the 29th. They gave a breakfast at Hotel Cecil to the gentlemen who had helped them. At the breakfast, the idea of the Committee was [formally] put forward. A fairly large number of persons was present. Lord Reay made a very good and powerful speech. There were also other effective speeches. But as I intend
 
 giving a separate account of the meeting and of the Committee, I shall say nothing more today.
 DELEGATES’ FAREWELL LETTER
 The Delegates have sent a letterlibtech_256_footnoteof thanks to the Press. They have said that the Indian community did not want to fight against the Colony, but wished to solve its problems amicably. When a blow was directed against the community, it had to use a shield to ward it off. The community would, as far as possible, act with due deference to the views of the colonists. But at the same time, it would demand that there should be no detraction from the normal  rights  to  which  every  citizen was entitled.
 SEND-OFF
 The Delegates left Waterloo station on December 1. Among those present to see them off were Sir Muncherji Bhownaggree, Mr. J.
 H. Polak, Mr. Ritch, the two Godfrey brothers, Mr. Suliman Manga, Mr. Mukerji, Mrs. Polak, Miss Smith, Mr. Simmonds, Prof. Parmanand and Mr. Ruthnum Pather.
 THANKS FOR HELP
 The names of those among the public men who helped us have already been mentioned and they have been thanked. But it remains for us to thank those who helped us without any thought of being publicly known. Among them are Mr. Simmonds, Miss Lawson, Mr. George Godfrey, Mr. James Godfrey, Mr. Ritch, Mr. Manilal Mehta, Mr. Adam Gool, Mr. Manga and Mr. Joseph Royeppen. Though Mr. Simmonds and Miss Lawson received payment, they did not work merely as wageearners. They worked late into the night ungrudg- ingly. The Godfrey brothers were in attendance everyday and assisted us. Gool and Manga, too, came whenever there was need. Similarly, Mr. Ruthnum Pather, who is at present studying in England, used to come and help us. But for all this help, the work of the M.P’s. could not have been carried out as planned. The number of notices issued to the M.P’s. alone was about 2,000. Anyone can realize the time that must have been taken in sending these out. It is superfluous to praise Mr. Ritch. His work is well known to the Indian community. Prof. Parmanand also gave us all the help that was needed.
 
 RITCH’S SPEECH
 Mr. Ritch delivered a speechlibtech_257_footnotebefore the East India Association.
As I give an account of it separately, I do not write about it here.
 CABLEGRAM AT MADEIRA
 Having finished our work, we left by s. s. Briton. We received two cablegrams when Briton touched Madeira. One was from Mr. Ritch, and the other from Johannesburg. Both said that the Ordinance had been refused assent by Lord Elgin. This was more than we had hoped for. But God’s ways are inscrutable. Well-directed efforts yield appropriate fruit. The case of the Indian community was just, and circumstances turned out to be favourable. It is a happy outcome, but we may not exult over it. Much of the struggle still lies ahead. The Indian community has still to do much of its duty. We shall be able to digest our victory only if we prove our worth. Otherwise, it will turn
out to be poison. We shall pursue these reflections later.
 NATAL STRUGGLE
 Lord Elgin has asked for a written statementlibtech_258_footnoteabout Natal. This has been sent to him. The result will come to be known in the course of time. The Committee that has been set up is left with the work of striving for Natal and Vrededorp. It will thus have little respite.

194,,A RETROSPECT,"
    
 It has been our practice, during Christmas every year, to take stock of the position of Indians in South Africa. On this occasion we are glad to be able to inform our readers of the success achieved by the Deputation in the matter of the Transvaal Ordinance, which is the most important event of the year. As a result of Lord Elgin with holding assent to the Ordinance, it is not only the Transvaal Indians
 
 who have benefited, but the entire Indian community in South Africa. The community has gone one step forward. The main reason for withholding sanction was, we believe, saving the Indian community from a stigma which the Ordinance was certain to have put on it. This means that the Imperial Government will not sanction any law that will apply to the Indians but not to the whites. If we are right in assuming this, the Vrededorp Stands Ordinance, which prohibits Indians from holding any leases of Stands in Vrede dorp, should also be refused sanction. And the Natal Municipalities Franchise Bill should also be treated likewise. The Natal Mercury has, however, drawn a distinction and based on it the demand that, while the Transvaal is still a Crown Colony and so open to interference from the Imperial Government in its legislation, Natal is a self-governing Colony and that the Imperial Government should not interfere in its affairs. This argument is fallacious; for there is a clause in the Constitution of Natal which requires that all class legislation passed by the Natal parliament should have the approval of theImperial Government before it becomes law. If therefore this clause is not a mere show-piece but meant really to protect the Indian community, the argument of The Natal Mercury is not valid. There is therefore every reason to expect that the Natal Bill too will be vetoed.

 "
195,,OPPRESSION IN THE CAPE,"
    
 It has come to our notice that, under the Cape Immigration Act, the Cape Indians, while taking out an immigration certificate  or permit, furnish their photograph, pay a fee of £1 and, on occasion, give their right and left thumb-impressions as well. We have also come to know that this has gone on for some time past. We are deeply grieved to learn this. It not only makes the Indians hang their heads in shame, but, if not stopped, it will have repercussions elsewhere and will harm the cause of the entire Indian community in South Africa. It is quite easy to remedy this evil. For, as we understand it, it is not done under any properly enacted law; it is the immigration officer who, in consultation with a few Indians, has introduced this system of taking photographs. If, therefore, Indians meet the immigration officer, immediate redress may be possible. We are anxious to learn that
 effective measures have been taken in this regard without the least delay. At one time the Asiatic Officer had introduced a similar regulation in the Transvaal; but it had to be repealed when the Indian community opposed it.
 Moreover, it is found that these certificates will be valid for one year only. There is absolutely no reason why they should be so  limited. To a man who has no knowledge of English but is a resident of the Cape, a permanent certificate should be issued stating that he has a right to return to the Cape. We are not prisoners released on parole that our certificates of freedom can be cancelled if we fail to return within a given period. The situation in the Cape is believed to be better than that elsewhere. We appeal to the Cape leaders to keep up that position by their diligence.

Mr. Ally and myself are very grateful to you for the kind sentiments
 you have expressed about us. Unity is our greatest need here. We are sure to obtain our just rights if we stand united and demand them politely but firmly. We could not have achieved anything in England but for the help we received from the people there. We have seen that British rule is essentially just and we can find redress for our grievances through representations. But we should not be elated by our success. Our struggle has just begun. Now it is up to us to retain the [fruits of] victory. We have to explain things to the politicians here. Before I conclude, I would appeal to all of you to do your duty, working actively, with body, mind and wealth, for the good of the community.

 On Wednesday, January 2, 1907, a dinner was given in honour of Gandhiji and Ally by Messrs M. C. Comroodeen & Co. at their premises in Grey Street, Durban. The Manager of the firm spoke on the occasion and Gandhiji and Ally replied. The following is a combined report of their speeches:
 [DURBAN,
 January 2, 1907]
 Messrs Gandhi and Ally each replied, and narrated their work in London. During their stay, short as it was, they came in contact with all classes of men from the
 humblest politician to the highest, including the Premier, and none of them on hearing the case put in such a reasonable light, grudged them their support, no matter what party he belonged to. To give some idea, the Delegates stated that 5,000 penny stamps were used for their work in London. The Committee that had been formed to watch their affairs was composed of highly influential men, to whom they entrusted their case in South Africa. Strong and sincere promises of help had been given by Members of both the Houses of Parliament, who were convinced of the moderation of their demand, and the conciliatory spirit of their case. When the Ordinance was introduced, it was passed so hurriedly that all the protests were disregarded, and yet they did not seek any outside interference. They took the right course, and the right had prevailed. They had high hopes from the work of theCommittee. The great organ of public opinion, The Times, in London, had opened its columns to discuss their case, and when the position was explicitly explained and understood, there was only one reply, and that was that their grievance was just, modest, and reasonable to any right-thinking human being. When they left the English shore, they had strong hopes that redress would not be denied to them: and when, after some days, they reached Madeira they had a cable to say that the Ordinance had been disallowed. The Delegates asked the audience to conform to all their responsibilities as citizens, and they had every hope from British justice. The struggle had only just begun, but they did not despair of the future.

 [DURBAN ,
 January 3, 1907]
 A number of associations have been founded recently. If they want to, they can do a great deal for the community. The workers in these associations should act as servants of these bodies, not as  masters. Only so can real service be rendered. Also we shall gain much strength and influence if the various associations co-operate with one another. Moreover, the suggestion made by Mr. Paul about education really deserves consideration. He also referred to the land in Phoenix. I am glad to say that I do not look upon it as my personal property, but as belonging to the community. I am sorry to state that the Government in India is trying to create disunity among Hindus and Muslims there. It would like to see us divided as it believes that only thus can British rule in India be perpetuated. A cablegram is published in The Advertiser today, which we cannot accept as gen- uine. It is certainly the Government which sends out these cablegrams and arranges such meetings. Many people want to know the main reason of our success [in London]. It lies in the perfect accord that obtained between Mr. Ally and myself. Never were there any differences between us. We have been successful only because we  acted  with  love  and  in  concert,  like  father   and   son.   It   should be remembered by all that, even though following different relig-ions, we remained united in our struggle. Secondly, truth andjustice were on our side. I believe God is always near me. He is never away from me. May you also act in this faith. Believe that God is near you and always follow the truth. This is all I ask of you.

199,"January 3, 1907",SPEECH AT DURBAN RECEPTION,"
    
 
 An address was presented to Gandhiji and Ally by the Mahomedan Association at the Indian Theatre in Victoria Street on Thursday, January 3, 1907. In reply to the address and speeches by Dawad Mahomed, Dada Abdulla and others, Gandhiji and Allyspoke. The following is a combined report of their speeches:
 [DURBAN,
 January 3, 1907] The Delegates spoke, each in their turn, on broad politics, further giving the audience a review of their hard work in England. They acknowledged the sterling
 services and important counsels given to them by Sir M. M. Bhownaggree, who placed his immense influence and long experience at their disposal, as did Mr. Ameer Ali, ex-judge of the Calcutta Supreme Court. The importance of India as a precious possession of the British Empire, with its 300,000,000 people who form a third part of the King-Emperor’s subjects, played a great part in their success. The English audience was, at several meetings, asked whether they would allow the South African colonists to ill-treat undeservedly the sons of India, who fought their wars in China, South Africa, Somaliland, Soudan, and the frontiers of India; the people whose loyalty could be gauged by remembering that a handful of white soldiers (about 78,000) was sufficient to guard the 300 millions of fellow-subjects in India, and whether they would like the representatives of the 13,000 British Indians of the Transvaal when they went back to India, to tell their kith and kin that the great Emperor who ruled this vast Empire was unable to save them from undue humiliation in South Africa at the hands of narrow-minded white colonists? The instant reply of the enthusiastic audiences was strongly in the negative.
 Messrs Gandhi and Ally convinced the Indian audience that they had returned with a confident conviction from England that any reasonable and just grievance, when laid with moderation before the English rulers at Home, would not go unredressed; and, in conclusion, asked the members of the community to conform to all the laws and by-laws of the Government whether just or unjust, and make themselves good citizens, as in them lay their own salvation. They must convince their white neighbours that their presence in South Africa was not unbeneficial to the Colony, and they must work side by side with European colonists, who should always be honoured as the predominant race.

 "
200,,REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION,"
    
 
 In his annual report recently published, the Superintendent of Education in Natal has said that whatever education is given [to Indians] is provided by the Government at its own expense and that the Indian community does nothing in the matter. The charge is partly, though not entirely, justified. Besides running a Madressa at Umgeni and one or two other private schools, the Indian community makes small occasional contributions towards the education of
 Indians. Hence we cannot admit the charge of the Superintendent in the form in which he has made it. But it will have to be admitted by every Indian to his shame that the charge is on the whole justified. Even in the Madressa there is plenty of scope for improvement if only we have the enthusiasm. We are firmly of the view that, just as there should be provision in every Madressa for the teaching of Arabic, so should there be provision for secular or practical education, that is, for the teaching of English and Gujarati or any other Indian language. Moreover, whatever teaching there is in Arabic is mostly parrot-like; in other words, it is learning by rote withoutunderstanding the meaning. On this point, we would advise our Muslim brethren to consider the example of Egypt. There education is imparted inArabic from childhood, but with comprehension of the meaning, so that all people can speak Arabic and understand what they read from the earliest age. This is also true of other education in the Egyptian Madressa. If this reform is carried out in every Indian Madressa, many Muslim children will receive some education without difficulty. In this matter we cannot but confess that the leaders of thecommunity have remained backward.
 Apart from the Madressa, there is so little by way of other facilities, and the Indian community has been so careless that we must admit whatever charge is made against us on this count. It does not become us to pass on the blame to others by saying that the Govern- ment does nothing for education. It is as much our duty as that of the Government to provide for education. If the Government fails in its duty, that is no reason for us to follow suit. On the contrary, if the Government does nothing for education, the responsibility of the Indian community becomes all the greater. We are therefore constra- ined to say that the above charge is quite justified.
 We know that it is easy to be critical but difficult to suggest remedies and apply them. But we shall be able to take a step forward only if we admit that we have been guilty. Three things are necessary for meeting the problem. The first thing is buildings and equipment. In this matter, only the well-to-do can do much.
 The second thing to be done is that, just as the rich ought to contribute money, so also ought educated Indians to place their education at the disposal of the community, free of charge or all but free of charge. Making money is not the object of education. If the Roman Catholic community is foremost in the world in the matter of
 education, it is so because it has from the beginning decided that those who are to be engaged in teaching should give their services free, accepting only what is necessary for their maintenance. Besides, they are of mature age and unmarried, so that they are able to devote all their time to the single job of teaching. We may or may not be able to reach that level, but there is no doubt that we ought to take a lesson from their example. Even those who have received but moderate education will do well to think over these suggestions. We shall consider later and in detail in what manner educated people can help, easily and without much trouble.libtech_263_footnote
 The third remedy lies in the hands of the parents. If among our people the parents had been eager to see their children educated, they would have made the necessary provision somehow, and means would have been found easily enough for the two measures suggested above. But Indian parents are backward in this respect, and to us this is a cause of humiliation. We cannot find a single period in history when an uneducated people has become prosperous. It is not that education has become necessary only in modern times; it has always been so. Only the form has changed. The kind of education, which we cannot do without now, was not absolutely necessary in olden days.  We believe that a people without modern education will fall behind in the end; not only that, it would not even be surprising if such a people were destroyed altogether. Be that as it may, it is certain that, whatever struggle we put up for our rights, the condition of Indians will never become what it ought to be as long as we remain backward in education.

 "
201,,INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS,"
    
 Many prominent people who formerly used to ignore the Congress took notice of its session this year. The main reason is the great storm that is raging in Bengal at present. Reuter has sent long reports to the newspapers here. This is the first time that the Congress has received such publicity. The session has also produced a great impression this year. The address by the Grand Old Man of India is
 
 very forceful and effective. His words deserve to be enshrined in our hearts. The substance of the address is that India will not prosper until we wake up and become united. To put it differently, it means that it lies in our hands to achieve swaraj, to prosper and to preserve the rights we value. On an earlier occasion we mentioned Mr. Asquith’s reply to the women of Great Britain that, if all of them demanded the franchise, it could not but be granted. We must therefore realize that, like us here, people in England too have difficulty in obtaining their rights. There, the people can secure their demands with less difficulty. That this is so is not because they are white, but because they are firmly united in their demands and, if these are rejected, they can create trouble for the rulers. When the South Africa British Indian Committee was formed in England, Dr. Oldfield said that strength and justice were dear to the British people. Under British rule, justice is often not to be had without some show of strength, whether of the pen, of the sword, or of money. For our part we are to use only  the strength that comes from unity and truth. That is to say, our bondage in India can cease this day, if all the people unite in their demands and are ready to suffer any hardships that may befall them.  These  thoughts, which relate to India, will also be useful to us here.

202,,TOBACCO,"
    
 We have written now and again in these columns about the harm done by smoking or chewing tobacco. The evil effects of tobacco, as our realization of them grows, have alarmed many great men. The famous Major-General Baden-Powelllibtech_264_footnoteof Mafeking, addressing schoolboys in Liverpool, said that many of the world’s best men were non-smokers. Basset, the football player, Grace, the  cricketeer, Henlane, the great rower, Weston, the walking champion, Tej, the golf star, Taylor, the great hunter, Celloo, the famous hiker, are all of them non-smokers. When Baden-Powell’s stock of tobacco ran out, the soldiers at Mafeking addicted to tobacco became absolutely useless, for they were helpless if they could not smoke. Thus smoking makes of man a slave. In England, it is said, addicts to smoking are quite
 
 indifferent to those around them. The evil effects of this habit become really very dangerous when it spreads among juveniles. They learn to steal and commit other crimes. They deceive their parents and ruin their health. They become irritable, and by the time they become adults, they lose their strength of mind. The habit of smoking has not spread as much among Indians as among Europeans. However, it will be adding to our many ills if educated Indians lose their sanity and take to smoking.

203,,BOOKS TO BE PUBLISHED,"
    
 We intend to publish translations or summaries of Englishbooks which have not yet been translated in India, but which are likely to be of use, more or less, to all Indian readers. Considering that a large section of our readers are Muslims, we are thinking of publishing a translation of the celebrated Mr. Justice Ameer Ali’s book on Islam which came out some time ago. Justice Ameer Ali has given us the permission to translate it. The consent of the publishers is yet to be had. If that also is received and if the idea is favoured by our readers and they are prepared to encourage us, we intend to publish a translation of The Spirit of Islam in book form. We must saythat Justice Ameer Ali’s book has won fame throughout the world and deserves to be read by every Muslim, indeed by every Indian. There is much to be learnt from it. We shall gratefully bear in mind any suggestions our readers may have to make. The suggestions, it is requested, should be brief and legibly written.

 The Cape Argus of Cape Town, commenting on the Asiatic Ordinance, suggests that the different governments of South Africa should consult with the Indian leaders with a view to finding a solution of the Indian problem in South Africa.libtech_272_footnoteIt says further that, if this is not done, both Britain and India will probably suffer. This is an important suggestion, made as it is for the first time by an English journal. If proper steps are immediately taken, it is likely to be acted upon.

208,,ETHICAL RELIGION-Ilibtech_273_footnote,"
    
 INTRODUCTION
 We propose, during the next few weeks, to write a series of articles on this subject for readers of Indian Opinion. Hypocrisy has nowadays increased in the world. Whatever a man’s religion, he thinks only of its outward form and fails in his real duty. In our  crazy pursuit of wealth, we seldom think of the harm we cause, or are likely
 
 
 to cause, to others. Women in Europe do not hesitate in the least to wear soft [kid] gloves even though these are made by killing young and tender animals. It is known the world over how Mr. Rockefeller, said to be the richest man in the  world,  violated many  rules  of morality in amassing his fortune. It is because such conditions prevail around them that  many  people  in  Europe  and  America  have turned against religion. They argue that, if any religion worth the name existed in the world, the inordinate wickedness that is rampant all round would not be there. This is a mistaken view. As it is common for a workman to quarrel with his tools and not try to look for his own faults, so, instead of thinking of the wickedness in themselves, men brand religion itself as humbug and go on acting and living as they please.
 Observing this trend and fearing that, if all religions are destroyed, a great calamity may befall the world and people may forsake the moral path altogether, many Americans anal Europeans have come forward to try, in a variety of ways, to bring the people back to that path.
 A Societylibtech_274_footnotehas been founded which has shown, after an investigat-ion of all religions, that not only do all of them teach morality but they are based for the most part on; ethical principles; that it is one’s duty to obey the laws of ethics whether or not one professes a religion; and that men who would not obey them could do no good either to themselves or to others, in this world or the next. The object of these societies is to influence those who have led to look down upon all religions because of the prevailing hypocrisy. They find out the fundamentals of all religions, discuss and write about the ethical principles common to them and live up to them. This creed they call Ethical Religion. It is not among the aims of these societies to criticize any religion. Men professing all religions can, and do, join these societies. The advantage of such a society is that  members  adhere to their own faith more strictly and pay greater attention to its moral teaching. They firmly believe that man ought to abide by the laws of morality and that if he does not, it mean an end to all order in the world and ultimate destruction.
 Mr Salter, a learned American, has published a book on the subject, which is excellent. Though it does not deal with any religion
 
 as such, it contains teachings of universal application. We shall publish the substance of these teachings every week. All that needs to be said about the author is that he practises whatever he advises others to do. We would only appeal to the reader to try to live up to those moral precepts that appeal to him. Then only may we regard our efforts as having been fruitful.
 CHAPTER I
 It is the moral nature of man by which he rises to good and noble thoughts. The different sciences show us the world as it is. Ethics tells us what it ought to be. It enables man to know how he should act. Man has two windows to his mind: through one he can see his own self as it is; through the other, he can see what it ought to be. It is our task to analyse and explore the body, the brain and the mind of man separately; but if we stop here, we derive no benefit despite our scientific knowledge. It is necessary to know about the evil effects of injustice, wickedness, vanity and the like, and the disaster they spell where the three are found together. And mere knowledge is not  enough, it should be followed by appropriate action. An ethical idea is like an architect’s plan. The plan shows how the building should be constructed; but it becomes useless if the building is not raised accordingly. Similarly, an ethical idea is useless so long as it is not followed by suitable action. There are many who memorize moral precepts and preach sermons, but they neither practise them nor do they mean to do so. There are some who believe that moral principles are not intended to be practised in this world; they are meant for the other world—the world which lies beyond death. A great thinker has said, “If you wish to attain perfection, you must begin from this very day to live according to the laws of morality at any cost.” We need not be scared away by such thoughts; on the contrary we should be glad to live up to them, considering our responsibility in the matter. “Certainly, cousin,” said the gallant Earl of Pembroke, on coming up to the Earl of Derby before Aubercoche and finding the battle already won, “you have neither been courteous nor behaved honour-ably to fight my enemies without waiting for me, seeing that you had sent for me”. Only when there is such readiness to accept moral responsibility will men tread the path of virtue.
 God is omnipotent, He is perfect. There are no limits to His mercy, to His goodness and to His justice. If this is so, how can we, His bond slaves, stray at all from the moral path? It is no fault of the
 ethical principles if one following them should fail. However, those committing a breach of morality have only themselves to blame.
 In the path of morality there is no such thing as reward for moral behaviour. If a man does some good deed, he does not do it to win applause, he does it because he must. For him doing good is but a higher kind of food, if one may compare food and goodness. And if someone should give him an opportunity to do a good deed, he would feel grateful just as a starving man would be grateful to the giver of food and bless him.
 This ethical religion, of which we have spoken, does not mean the cultivation of gentlemanliness. It does mean that we  should  become a little more diligent, a little better educated, a little cleaner and neater, etc. All this is no doubt included in it, but it touches only the fringe of ethical religion. Many more things have to be done by man if he would walk along this path; and he has to do them as a matter of duty, knowing them to be a part of his nature, not for gaining any worldly benefit.

211,"January 12, 1907",LETTER TO “THE OUTLOOK”,"
           [JOHANNESBURG 
    [TO  THE 	EDITOR 	THE OUTLOOK SIR,]  Before 	January 12, 1907] 
  	May I congratulate you on having recognized by your exhaustive 	leader on “British Indians in the Transvaal” in your issue of 	November 24 the Imperial importance of the question? And may I, at 	the same time, point out that you have, in justifying the 	anti-Indian policy of the Europeans, done, no doubt unconsciously, 	an injustice to British Indians in a twofold manner?  	First, in my humble opinion, you have missed the central question. 	You seem to think that Indians on the one hand demand an open door 	for an unrestricted influx of their countrymen, and that the white 	colonists on the other, from an instinct of self- preservation, 	demand that the door should be tightly closed. Such, however, is not 	the case. Indians ask for the ordinary civil rights enjoyed  by  all 	human beings, except criminals, in any civilized state. They admit 	the principle of restriction of further immi-gration of their 	brethren along the lines even as adopted by Aust-ralia, but they 	say, with Mr. Chamberlain that they may not be restricted solely 	because theyare British Indians. If Imperia-lism has any meaning, 	how can any exception be taken to a position such as above? I have 	no doubt that you, sir, will admit that even a self-governing 	colony, so long as it chooses to remain a part of the Empire, may 	not go so far as to degrade and ill-treat those whom it finds 	settled within its borders on assumption of self-governing powers.  	Secondly, you talk of the necessity of sacrifice of a “principle 	of logic” (as you are pleased to term it) to the principle of 	“high expediency”. To me, it is not logic so much as morality 	you would sacrifice on the altar of expediency; but assuming that a 	logical or a moral principle may be so sacrificed, what is “higher 	expediency”? It is a wanton wounding of the susceptibilities of a 	finely strung and highly loyal community like the millions of India, 	or a firm refusal on the part of the Imperial watchdog sitting, 	inLord Milner’s language, 
 on the watch-tower, and sweeping the whole horizon before him to protect an unreasoning and unreasonable colour prejudice.
 You incidentally mention the Treaty of Vereeniginglibtech_277_footnote. May I draw your attention to the fact that, even if the term “Native” as used there were to include British Indians, it merely suspends a considera- tion of the granting of the political franchise to the “Natives” until after the establishment of responsible government in the Colony. British Indians have, however, in unmistakable language stated that they do not aspire, at any rate at the present stage, to political power.

212,,QUINN’S SPEECH,"
    
 Mr. Quinn’s speech, as reported by our Johannesburg correspondent,libtech_278_footnotedeserves attention. It shows that the white population is altogether in the dark about our conditions. Mr. Quinn believes that
  the 	Asiatic Ordinance would 	have prevented the 	entry of 	Indians without permits; 	(2) there 	are many Indians 	who have entered 	the country 	without permits; (3) the 	Transvaal law 	would also have served 	to check 	Indian trade. 
 All these statements are incorrect. The Transvaal Ordinance which has been disallowed would not have prevented the entry of permitless Indians. The only law that can prevent the entry of such persons is the Peace Preservation Ordinance. Also it is not true that many Indians enter without permits. Recent cases show that people are effectively prevented from doing so. Furthermore, every one knows that the Asiatic Ordinance had no bearing on Indian trade.
 All the same, it should be borne in mind that harm is done to the whole Indian community to the extent that some try to enter without permits or with forged ones. Those engaged in such activities should desist from them.
Above all, leading Indians should do all they can to remove this
 
 kind of misunderstanding among the white population. A recent example is the incident that occurred in the house of Mr. Dawad Mahomed, which we mention elsewhere.

213,,VREDEDORP ORDINANCE,"
    
 It will be seen from our Johannesburg Letter that the Vrededorp Ordinance has been passed.libtech_279_footnoteThus there is a danger of Vrededorp Indians having to leave the place. Now that the Ordin-ance has been passed, the Indian community should realize that there is much work ahead, and that it will have to put up a hard fight. If the Asiatic Ordinance was cancelled, it was only because the matter was widely discussed in England. The same telegram which brought us the news of the passing of the Vrededorp Ordinance also says that our Committee in London is working hard in the matter of the Natal Municipal Bill. It remains to be seen what the result will be. Whatever it be, one thing at least is proved by this: the Committee that we have formed in England should be strengthened and supported energeti- cally. It certainly ought not to be wound up. We invite the attention of every reader to the summary of Mr. Ritch’s first letter published by us. If the Committee continues to work in that manner, there is every chance of our profiting a great deal.
 This Ordinance [business] also shows that there is nothing like self-help in any matter whatever.

214,,JAPAN AND AMERICA,"
    
 The quarrel between Japan and America still continues. California has a large Japanese population, which has made much progress by dint of its intelligence and skill. There are many Japanese boys in American schools. The white population there cannot bear this. Japan is putting up a hard fight over this issue. So far, there has been no solution. President Roosevelt is in a difficult situation. On the one hand, a brave people like the Japanese is being insulted. On the other, those among the white population who would  not  mind America being involved in a war refuse to listen to Roosevelt’s advice and do not allow Japanese boys to enter the schools. It is  an  impossible situation. America is not in a position even to fight. The Japanese Navy is very much stronger than the American, and only recently it proved its mettle.
 In a situation such as this, England too has to weigh matters carefully. While the Japanese are friends of the English, the Ameri- cans are their cousins. Whom should England support? It is believ-ed that war can be averted only if England intervenes effectively.

 A feverish election campaign is going on in-the Transvaal in view of the new parliament that is to come. into existence. Mr. Quinn is working hard to enter Parliament. Addressing his electorate, he spoke to the following effect:
 As a result of the Asiatic Ordinance passed by the Legislative Council some time ago, it has become very diffi-cult for Asiatics to enter without a permit. Those who voted for that Act bore no malice towards the Asiatics. There is no point in saying that they are British subjects. For there are some British subjects with white skins with whom I would have nothing to do.
 
 
 It is in self-defence therefore that we oppose their coming in. Our views in this matter are identical with those expressed by Mr. Chamberlain, The Asiatics who manage to live on a tenth of the money needed by the whites are not justified in expecting to enter and settle here in large numbers It is not proper that such men should compete with us. It is necessary therefore to take steps to prevent them from doing so. The present position is that, out of the five thousand licences issued at Johannesburg, ten per cent. have gone to the Asiatics—270 to the Indians and 255 to the Chinese. This should not happen. These shops should be closed down and the shopkeepers given compen-sation. The British Government with held assent to the Asiatic Ordinance because they were not aware either of our real condition or of our feelings in the matter. I do not believe that the British Govern-ment intend to do us harm. Theyhave not taken the side of the sufferers, and if they have with held assent to the Ordinance for that reason, they will not hesitate to accord sanction to the Ordinance when the [new] parliament of the Transvaal meets and reenacts it unanimously.

 CHAPTER II: IDEAL MORALITY
 The current views of morality are not of a very high order. Some believe that morality is not something quite essential. Others think that there is no relation between religion and morality. But an examination of the world’s religions shows that, without morality, religion cannot subsist. True morality covers religion for the most part. Anyone who observes the laws of morality for their own sake and not for any selfish end can be regarded as religious. There are men in Russia who dedicate their lives to the good of their country. Such men are truly moral. A man like Jeremy Bentham, who discovered many good principles for English legislation, tried very hard to spread education among the English and took a prominent part in improving the condition of prisoners, may be regarded as truly moral.
 Besides, it is a rule of ideal morality that it is not enough to
 follow the trodden path. We ought to follow the path which we know to be true, whether it is familiar or unfamiliar to us. In other words, when we know a particular path to be the right one, we should set out on it without fear. We can progress only if we observe the laws of morality in this way. That is why true morality, true civilization and true progress are always to be found together.
 If we examine our desires, we shall see that we do not wish for what we have already. We always value more that which we do not have. But desires are of two kinds: one is the pursuit of mere self- interest.To attempt to fulfil this kind of desire is immoral. The other impels us constantly to improve ourselves and to do good to others. We should never become overweening with any amount of good that we may do. It is not for us to evaluate it, but rather should we have perpetual longing to become better and do more good. True morality consists in our effort to realize such longing.
 If we have no home or family of our own, that is nothing to be ashamed of. But if we have a home and abuse it, or own a business and practise fraud, we stray from the path of morality. Morality consists in doing what we ought to do. We can prove the need of morality through a few illustrations. Destruction has been the lot of peoples or families in which the seeds of immorality, such as disunity and untruth, were found. To take an example from trade and business, we do not come across a single person who will say that truth should not be followed. The effect of justice and goodness is not felt from outside; these qualities in here in us. Four hundred years ago, much injustice and untruth prevailed in Europe, so that people could not rest in peace even for a moment. The cause of this state of affairs was that people had no morality. If we take out the essence of all moral laws, we shall find that the attempt to do good to mankind is the highest morality. If we open the treasure-house of morality with this key, we shall find in it all the other principles.
 At the end of each of these articles, we print select poems bearing on morality from Gujarati or Urdu poets in the hope that all our readers will benefit from them and will also commit them to memory. We begin with an extractlibtech_282_footnotefrom Mr. Malbari’slibtech_283_footnotebook, Adami Ane Teni Duniya.

  CHI. 	CHHAGANLAL,  	I sent some matter yesterday. Today, I send something about the 	Hejaz Railway and an incomplete feature about the Amir. The rest I 	shall write out tonight. All this must appear this week. I wrote to 	you earlier about the Amir’s photograph. Let me know how many 	extra copies sell. What I write tonight will be in your hands on 	Thursday. That will be in time.  	The list of persons in Johannesburg from whom subscriptions have 	been collected has been misplaced. Ask Kalyandas about it. About 	publishing names, please speak to Mr. West yourself and       
 be emphatic about it. He may entrust the work to Manialibtech_288_footnote,  if  he chooses. I will also write. One should sometimes use one’s discretion in matters like these.
 Your devoting an hour between 8 and 9 to Manilal will naturally provoke resentment. It looks improper that you should do private work for me during Press hours. It should be enough, therefore, if you can give him any time before 8 in the morning or some time in the evening. It should be left to his luck what he can learn in that time.
 I have promised a piano to Mania and that is what stands in the way. If he is agreeable, by all means save the expense for the present.
 It was good that an appeal for a band was made. I feel this begging is selfless. If a band is secured, everyone will share in the benefit. I see its need for [every] one of us. I don’t think Mr. West has made any mistake in this matter. It is not necessary to spend much effort on the thing. The loss of one day doesn’t matter. We want ultimately to save time. The men we have are not yet well trained; when they are, all work will proceed apace.
 I will give my views about the Hindi [section] after I hear from you again. It is certain, however, that the venture will be possible only if we are assured of subscribers in advance.
 There is no objection to giving the market rates in the English section. They would go better, however, in the Gujarati sectionor in the advertisement columns. The English section is purely political at present; therefore, market rates will appear out of place in it.
 I will write about the bill for the Anti-Indian Law Fund after giving some thought to it.
 Ismail Mia has agreed to have the advertisement without a block. You may therefore have it so. Perhaps he will pay only  for  the reduced space.
 Give  me  full  particulars  about  the  cuttings  that  have  been left over.
 I have written to Beck to say hat I cannot recommend patent medicines to anyone, since most of them seem to have no stuff in them.

From 	the Gujarati original: S.N. 4786         	His Majesty the Amir of Afghanistan has shown his nobility within a 	few days of his arrival in India. This is shown by two Reuter 	messages received here. When he was inspecting a guard of honour in 	Delhi, he was offered an umbrella because it was raining. The Amir 	too preferred to get drenched and refused the umbrella because the      
 soldiers were all exposed to the rain. The second cable says that the Muslims who wished to give a party in the Amir’s honour had  arranged for a hundred cows to be slaughtered on the occasion. The Amir suggested that this would probably offend the Hindu sentiment and advised the gentlemen that they might slaughter goats instead. They accepted his advice. It is said that the whole of India was agreeably surprised by the Amir’s gesture. All the more so, as they did not expect His Majesty to show concern for others to the extent that he did.These two incidents show that His Majesty the Amir has a considerate and sincere mind. On both the occasions he thought of the people[‘s wishes], thus setting an example for monarchs of the West to learn from. Though the news agencies cannot tell us of more instances of such thoughtful actions of his, one can easily imagine that Amir Habibullah has all the virtues that his namelibtech_293_footnotelibtech_294_footnoteconnotes.

222,,WOMEN’S EDUCATION,"
    
 That India is very backward in the education of women is a fact that cannot be denied. But by admitting this, we do not mean to suggest that Indian women fail in their duty. We believe that, as there are in the world few men of any class who can compete with the
 
 Indians considered from all points of view, so are there few women anywhere in the world who can compare with Indian women. But this position can no longer be kept up in the present squalid, low and helpless state of India. The modern age is such that it does not allow anyone to remain in the same position. Those who do not want to go forward, or do not do so, must fall behind. In so far as this is true, we can see that Indian men have deliberately kept their women backward. Those who pose as refor-mers as also other well-to-do  Indians,  whether Hindu or Muslim, Parsi or Christian, either treat their women as if they were playthings or use them as they fancy for self- indulgence, with the result that they themselves become weak and help only to produce weaklings. And in this way they lead irreligious lives and still say, ‘It is God’s will that prevails.’ If this state of affairs continues, India will remain in its present abominable condition even if she were to secure all her rights from the British Government. In all countries where the people live a decent life, there is no disparity in the conditionlibtech_296_footnoteof men and women. It is easy to see how much the real wealth of India would be attenuated, if one half of her human beings remained ignorant and existed only as playthings of the others.
 These thoughts occurred to us while reading an address delivered to French girls by M. Lavis, a great servant of France. Only a few years ago French women were in the same plight in which Indian women are today. French society has now awakened and does not wish to let a half of its body remain inactive. We give below a short summary of M. Lavis’s speech:
 Girls, there is much for you to learn. It is your function to use the needle and the scissors. You have to learn how to keep your home tidy. If there is order in the home, its influence will be felt without, and the village or town will reflect the state of the home. You will also have to learn to use money. You will be mothers one day, and your children’s future will depend on you. It is not enough that you learn to read and write. You have to cultivate your minds too. For it is the mother who provides the real training for her child. Just as you ought to develop your minds, so do, whether they are better or worse off than you. That is why must you inform yourself of what is happening around you, what countries there are in the world besides your own, what people there you are taught history and geography.
 
 Just as there are schools for boys, there ought to be schools for girls also.
 It is while thus addressing schoolgirls genially at a large Paris school that M. Lavis indicated in passing the duty of parents. We have a large number of girls and women among Indians in South Africa. It is our definite opinion that they should both have good education. Such education can be easily imparted; but only if we stop dallying with our womenfolk and realize our duty. While imparting education, we have to bear in mind its aims. We would gain nothing if such education were designed for selfish ends. That would be only like changing one’s dress.

223,,JAPAN’S GAMElibtech_297_footnote,"
    
 Every one—Indians in particular—has much to learn from  Japan. There has been trouble in certain parts of America where Japanese boys are refused admission to schools. Reports in the English Press show that the dispute has not yet ended. The Americans do not wish to give up their stand. Japan, it appears, will not brook dishonour. Some persons believe that America and Japan will soon go to war over this. In that case, some believe that Japan will prove the stronger of the two. Much will depend on the British. At present there subsists amity between Japan and Britain. If the British intervene and help in maintaining peace, then alone, it seems, can bloodshed be averted.

 CHAPTER III: WHAT IS MORAL ACTION?
 When can it be said that a particular action is moral? In asking this question, the intention is not to contrast moral with immoral actions, but to consider many of our everyday actions against which nothing can be said from the conventional standpoint and which some
 
 regard as moral. Most of our actions are probably non-moral; they do not necessarily involve morality. For the most part we act according to the prevailing conventions. Such conventional behavi-our is often necessary. If no such rules are observed, anarchy would be the result, and society—social intercourse—would come to an end. Still the mere observance of custom and usage cannot properly be called morality.
 A moral act must be our own act: it must spring from our own will. If we act mechanically, there is no moral content in our act. Such action would be moral, if we think it proper to act like a machine and do so. For in doing so, we use our discrimination. We should bear in mind the distinction between acting mechanically and acting inten- tionally. It may be moral of a king to pardon a culprit. But the messenger bearing the order of pardon plays only a mechanical part in the king’s moral act. But if the messenger were to bear the king’s order, considering it to be his duty, his action would be a moral one. How can a man understand morality who does not use his own intelligence and power of thought, but lets himself be swept along like a log of wood by a current? Sometimes a man defies convention and acts on his own with a view to [doing] absolute good. Such a great hero was Wendell Phillipslibtech_298_footnote. Addressing an assembly of people, he once said, “Till you learn to form your own opinions and express them, I do not care much what you think of me.” Thus when we all care only for what our conscience says, then alone can we be regarded to have stepped on to the moral road. We shall not reach this stage, as long as we do not believe—and experience the  belief—that  God within us, the God of all, is the ever present witness to all our acts.
 It is not enough that an act done by us is in itself good; it should have been done with the intention to do good. That is to say, whether an act is moral or otherwise depends upon the intention of the doer. Two men may have done exactly the same thing; but the act of one may be moral, and that of the other the contrary. Take, for instance, a man who out of great pity feeds the poor and another who does the same, but with the motive of winning prestige or with some such selfish end. Though the action is the same, the act of the one is moral and that of the other non-moral. The reader here ought to remember the distinction between the two words, non-moral and immoral. It may be that we do not always see good results flowing from a moral act. While thinking of morality, all that we need to see is that the act is
 
 good and is done with a good intention. The result of an action is not within our control. God alone is the giver of fruit. Historians have called Emperor Alexander “great”. Wherever he went [in the course of his conquests,] he took the Greek language and Greek culture, arts and manners, and today we enjoy the benefits of Greek civilization. But the intention of Alexander behind all this was only conquest and renown. Who can therefore say that his actions were moral? It was all right that he was termed “great”, but moral he cannot be called.
 These reflections prove that it is not enough for a moral act to have been done with a good intention, but it should have been done without compulsion. There is no morality whatever in my act, if I rise early out of the fear that, if I am late for my office, I may lose my situation. Similarly there is no morality in my living a simple and unpretentious life if I have not  the  means  to  live  otherwise.  But plain, simple living would be moral if, though wealthy, I think of all the want and misery in the world about me—and feel that Iought to live a plain, simple life and not one of ease and luxury. Like wise it is only selfish, and not moral, of an employer to sympathize with his employees or to pay them higher wages lest they leave him. It would be moral if the employer wished well of them and treated them kindly realizing how he owed his prosperity to them. This means that for an act to be moral it has to be free from fear and compulsion. When the peasants rose in revolt and with bloodshot eyes went to King Richard II of England demanding their rights, he granted them the  rights under his own seal and signature. But when the danger was over, he forced them to surrender the letters. It would be a mistake for anyone to say that King Richard’s first act was moral and the second immoral. For his first act was done only out of fear and had not an iota of morality about it.
 Just as a moral action should be free from fear or compulsion so should there be no self-interest behind it. This is not to  say  that actions prompted by self-interest are all worthless, but only that to call them moral would detract from the [dignity of the] moral idea. That honesty cannot long endure which is practised in the belief that it is the best policy. As Shakespeare says, love born out of the profit motive is no love.libtech_299_footnote
 
 When it is mingled with respects that stand Aloof from the entire point.”
 
 Just as an action prompted by the motive of material gain here on earth is non-moral, so also another done for considerations of comfort and personal happiness in another world is non-moral. That action is moral which is done only for the sake of doing good. A great Christian, St. Francis Xavier, passionately prayed that his mind might always remain pure.libtech_300_footnoteFor him devotion to God was not for enjoying a higher seat after death. He prayed because it was man’s duty to pray. The great Saint Theresa wished to have a torch in her right hand and a vessel of water in her left, so that with the one she might burn the glories of heaven and with the other extinguish the fires of hell, and men might learn to serve God from love alone— without fear of hell and without temptation of heavenly bliss. To preserve morality thus demands a brave man prepared to face even death. It is cowardice to be true to friends and to break faith with enemies. Those who do good out of fear and haltingly have no moral virtue. Henry Clay, known for his kind liness, sacrificed his convic- tions to his ambition. Daniel Websterlibtech_301_footnote, for all his great intellect and his sense of the heroic and the sublime, once sold his intellectualintegrity for a price. By a single mean act he wiped out all his good deeds. This shows how difficult it is to judge the morality of a man’s action because we cannot penetrate the depths of his mind. We have also the answer to the question raised at the outset in this chapter: what is a moral action? Inciden-tally, we also saw which kind of men could live up to that morality.libtech_302_footnote

 CABLEGRAM TO AMIR
 The Hamidia Islamic Society has sent a cable through Lord Selborne conveying greetings to His Majesty the Amir of Afghani- stan on the occasion of his visit to India. Lord Selborne’s Secretary has informed Mr. Haji Ojer Ally that the cablegram has been forwarded.
 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS
 The local Press is busy publishing reports of the election speeches of candidates for the proposed Transvaal parliament. These candidates have been making speeches at one place after another. Declaring their views on Indians, they all state that the parliament should re-enact the Ordinance that has met with the disapproval of the Imperial Government. Some say that every Indian trader should be paid compensation and sent back. Others say that they should be deported without the payment of compensation. None of them, however, understands the exact import of the Ordinance. This is the state of affairs in the Transvaal. Defeat seems probable for the Progressive Party, many of whose members are supporters of the mine-owners or big shareholders. The indications are that the Boers will defeat the others.
 SIR RICHARD SOLOMON
 Sir Richard Solomon has returned from England. After a brief stay with Lord Selborne, he has gone to Pretoria. When the Press representatives met him at Cape Town, he declined to express any opinion or to give any information. He intends to resign and enter parliament. People are eager to know which party he will join. Some persons are displeased because he has not expressed his opinion, and they accuse him of playing a double game.
 PERMITS FOR BOYS
 Indian children under sixteen whose parents are in the Transvaal can enter without a permit. But two questions have now been raised in the matter. First, how can these boys, on attaining majority, continue to remain without a permit? Secondly, how can they re-enter on return from a visit to their native country? The Registrar refuses to help and demands to know why a permit should be sought after the Supreme Court has ruled that no permit is necessary for children. It appears the
 
 Registrar is only venting his anger. It is true that minor children need no permit. But that does not mean that a permit should not be issued to them as a safeguard when they become majors or go out of the Transvaal. Now there seems to be no remedy other than a petition. For the law does not oblige the Permit Office to issue such permits. The law only says that children need no permits and that they will be protected against harassment from any quarter.

226,,DUTY OF EDUCATED INDIANS,"
    
 While commenting on the report of the Superintendent of Education in Natal.libtech_303_footnotewe said that we would consider later  how educated Indians could help without much trouble to themselves. We do so now.
 Among Indians, grown-ups as well as children have much to learn. During the day, most of them are too busy to learn anything. Similarly, educated Indians also are busy at that time. In all big cities of the world, there are large numbers of night schools. We take it that there are some truly educated young Indians who are patriotic and anxious to pass on to others the education that they have themselves had. Such persons can persuade all grown-ups and boys, with whom they come in contact, to learn; and if three or four persons agree to do so, they can decide to gather at one place. Even if only one person is willing, it should still be possible for them to go to his place to teach him.
 As things stand, those who wish to learn are as few as those prepared to teach. For anyone who is eager to teach, it is not therefore enough just to be ready to do so. It is also necessary to inspire others with the urge to learn.Some may, we are well aware, think that all this sounds nice on paper, but that it is not so easy to work out. We only wish to say in reply that what we write here is addressed to courageous patriots and that it is moreover based on experience and so ought not to be dismissed as impracti-cable.

 I have not yet answered the points you raised in your letter of the 9th.
 I did not follow what Mr. Anglialibtech_305_footnoteand Mr. Osman said about advertisements.
 I want a list in English, with prices, of Hindi and Tamil books available with Mr. Abdool Haq or Doraisamy. A White wants such books for Indians who work with him, that is, he wants books which Indians of average ability and knowing some Hindi or Tamil can understand. I have promised him a list.
 Let  me  know  what  happened  about  the  demand   for   a Hindi section.
I have not yet selected a photograph for the block.
 I have great faith in you. I am in no position to give thought to myself. There is much work to be done. We are only a few, and not all of us well up in general knowledge. As I think of all this, I feel inclined to send you immediately to England. I want to  know, however, if you have fully grasped the Indian problem here. What do you feel yourself? What encouragement is Maganlal likely to give? What does Anandlal think? All the same I want your opinion immediately whether Thakkar can assume the responsibility for the Gujarati section. I should like you to sail off, —no harm even if it takes four months—provided of course Maganlal agrees to share the financial burden and Miss West picks up the accounts. I leaveit to you whether or not to talk to others. You may talk about it only if you think fit. If you yourself feel that you should not go yet, there is no need to pursue the matter further.
 In any case from next week pass on the responsibility for translations, etc., in the Gujarati section to Thakkar, so that you may be free for other work. It will suffice if you supervise the general policy of Indian Opinion. I don’t think the last issue was bad. I will let you know after I hear from you as to what was held over. Entrust
 
 feature-writing to him, so that you may be free. Of course, if anything improper appears, such as should not have been published, the blame will be yours.
 Mr. Medh wants to leave. He has a chance of getting a job in Durban. Relieve him, therefore, on Monday, and pay him the arrears of his salary. Write to me if you think that a substitute will  be necessary.
 I shall wait for more information about Tongaat. There was a telegram here also.
 You will be surprised to know that Mr. Isaac had been to Pretoria. I will take him round here too, and send him to Pretoria once again. Kalyandas told me that he had not received the complete list relating to Pretoria. Send me one again. I sent you the figures yesterday, from which you may understand which amounts to credit and which to debit. I have not looked into them. If there is anything in these figures to which it is worth drawing my attention, please let me know.
 What you say about advertisements concerning fish is right. We will not refuse such advertisements if we receive any, but we will not solicit them.
 So long as the name has not been changed in the Colonial Office, we must take out the licence in the name of Madanjitlibtech_306_footnote. Please do so.
 I had received the cutting concerning Jivanji. But what was to be done about it? You gave a summary of it in Gujarati. Have you received Jivanji’s money from Mombasa? If not collect it from Adamji. It will be well to go to the Cape during Easter. I will write to Abdool Gani.
It is impossible for us to bring out the Tamil [section] just now.
Its time will come by and by.
 I see no need to write to Mr. Aiyar. Your replying in  the  negative is sufficient.
 Anandlal has  sent  the  list  of Gujarati  types.  I  will  order them. Harialibtech_307_footnotemust have sent the receipt for Kalyandas’s luggage. stake delivery of it. You should not omit the advertisements from here

228,,A MARE’S NEST,"
    
 The Natal Advertiser has published what purports to be a report of an Indian meeting held in order to consider certain complaints against the Natal Indian Congress and to form a new body. We notice, from our Johannesburg correspondence, that the contents of the precious report were telegraphed to the Johannesburg Star, in extenso. It evidently appears as if the wish was father to the thought, and that some “good-natured” people would rather see a quarrel between different sections of the Indian community. We may, therefore, assure these friends that such a quarrel is not possible, because there can be no backbone to it. It is worthy of note that it is not stated in the inspired report where the meeting took place, who convened it, who attended it, and when it was held.
 We have, however, taken the trouble to inquire about it, and we find that some such meeting did take place at a private house. But the whole aspect is changed when the facts are known. The meeting discussed the question of founding a political institution apart from the Congress, but little encouragement was given by the speakers to this proposal, and the weight of opinion did not favour it. We think the following letter, addressed to The Advertiser by Mr. V. Lawrence, Chairman of the meeting, places the matter in its true light:
 Sir, In your second edition of the 17th instant, there appears on page 5 what purports to be the report of a meeting of the Colonial Hindus and Christianized Indians that took place on Tuesday night last, headed “Natal Hindus, Dissatisfaction with the Natal Indian Congress, Representation Desired”. As chairman of that meeting, I must most emphatically refute many of the statements therein. The object of that meeting was to form a very influential and representative committee to approach the Natal Indian
 Congress, which is recognized by the Imperial and Colonial Governments as the representative institution of the Indian community in Natal, to make it a more representative body than it is at present. It is not true that it was pointed out during the discussion that the association of the Colonial Indian and Hindu community with the Mohammadan merchants was derogatory to the good opinion of the European section of the country in regard to the former.It was not only the idea, but the first and foremost object of the meeting was, and all the discussion that night was directed to achieve that object, to unite with, and not to dissociate from, the Natal Indian Congress, to obtain redress for the disabilities that are and may be heaped upon the Indian community.
 It is not correct that minor matters were then discussed and the meeting broke up without any definite decision being come to. The meeting dispersed after the election of a thoroughly representative committee of all classes of the Indian community to approach the Natal Indian Congress, and I was deputed to interview the President and the Secretaries of the Congress, and ascertain from them what day, time and place will suit the Congress to hear the views of the committee. We have neither desire nor intention to work against either the Congress or the Europeans, but to unite with the Congress in creating a better understanding between the European and Indian communities.
 We are glad to notice that the prominent Hindus of Durban met together on Sunday for the purpose of repudiating the statements made in the newspaper report. Mr. Sanghavi, the Chairman of this meeting, said that perfect amity and concord existed between the different sections of the Indian community, irrespective of caste, creed or religion.
 If, however, there are any young Indians, besides the person that concocted The Advertiser report, who feel aggrieved at not being able to figure prominently in the work of the Congress, we strongly advise them to steer clear of any movement that would bring about discord between the different sections of the community.
 It may be well to examine the origin of the Natal Indian Congresslibtech_308_footnote. It was established when a general attack on the Indian community on the part of some European colonists was commenced. The trustees of the Congress include two Hindus, one of them a Tamil gentleman, and on the Congress membership are scores of Hindus and Christians belonging to different presidencies of India. Its objects are
 
 all-embracing, and if the attention paid to the Tamil community is to count for anything, it is but simple truth to state that, during the first few years of the Congress existence, it was largely occupied with matters more especially concerning that community. It may also be not amiss to say, in passing, that it was under the aegis of the Congress that the Natal Indian Educational Association was able to thrive and flourish. The Congress Hall was placed free of charge at its disposal. The Congress funds, again, enabled the Diamond Jubilee Librarylibtech_309_footnote, opened chiefly in the interests of Colonial Indians, to be established. If the Indian traders today loom large at the Congress meetings, it is because they are the most in danger; and if they were neglected or allowed themselves to be neglected, who will suffer? Certainly the whole Indian community; for throughout the world it is the commer- cial class that supplies the sinews of war and even common sense to the community or nation to which it belongs.

229,,WILL THERE BE DISSENSION AMONG INDIANS?,"
    
 The Advertiser has published a report under the heading “The Hindus of Natal” which will perhaps cause concern among some Indians. However, we do not think, there is any need to be agitated. We print a summary of that report elsewhere. The report does not say who attended the meeting or where it was held. Also, we do not find what resolution was passed at the meeting. There is no doubt that this is the work of some disgruntled Indians. It is obvious enough that they will receive help from the Europeans. We have with us a circular notice of that meeting, signed by Messrs Bryan Gabriel, V. Lawrence and A. D. Pillay; and the meeting was held at Mr. A. D. Pillay’s house on the 15th at eight o’clock. No action by us is called for, since there is no reason why any changes should be made in the constitution of the Congress. Moreover, this meeting was merely meant to be a threat, and there can be no question of yielding to such threats and making changes. However, it is the duty of the Congress leaders to adhere to the Congress constitution and to all its rules. Congress members who have not paid their subscription should be made to do so, and annual reports published as before. As for the meeting, it is not necessary to blame either those who convened or those who attended it. It can be
 
 seen from [the report of] the meeting of the Hindu Reforms Council held in the Hall and from Mr. V. Lawrence’s letterlibtech_310_footnotethat the report published in The Advertiser is quite false. The only thing  for thoughtful people and the Congress to do is their duty, and then they should not entertain any fear. If this is done, there will be no  dissension.

230,,NATAL LICENSING ACT,"
    
 At the beginning of each year Indians in Natal go through a period of acute anxiety. All traders, big and small remain in suspense for they are not sure whether they will get [renewed] licences. This time, it seems, preparations are afoot for greater harassment [of Indians].
 LADYSMITH
 In Ladysmith notice has been given to all traders that they will not get their licences next year. Some have been refused lice-nces even for the current year for the alleged reason that they do not know how to keep accounts in English.
 TONGAAT
 In Tongaat licences have been refused to many Indians, the reasons given being lack of cleanliness and the  unsatisfactory condition of accounts.
 ELSEWHERE
 Meetings are held all over the Colony where Europeans pass resolutions to the effect that no licences should be issued to Indian traders. There is no immediate danger, as a result of these resolutions, of licences being withheld in all places. There is no doubt, however, that, if steps are not taken from now on, it will be too late afterwards.
 REMEDIAL MEASURES
 Let us consider what measures can be taken. It is quite necessary that those who have been refused licences should file appeals with the Licensing Board. Such appeals cost very little. While preferring an
 
 appeal, it is necessary to produce evidence regarding account books, the condition of shops, etc. The reason for filing an appeal is that it is the only legal remedy. It must be resorted to before other steps are taken. Moreover, by filing the appeals, it will be possible to prove that the licensing officer and the Licensing Board are a single [authority], not two different ones. Along with the appeal an application should also be made to the local Government, that is, to  the  Colonial Secretary.
 THE CONGRESS
 In this matter, it is necessary to know the help that can be expected from the Congress and the expenditure that should be borne by each individual. The Congress will be able to write to the Govern- ment. But where it is necessary to file appeals, the residents of the respective towns and places will have to bear the cost.
 SOUTH AFRICA BRITISH INDIAN COMMITTEE
 As far as we know the Congress has sent a cable to the South Africa British Indian Committee asking it to take the necessary measures in the matter of licences. It will be the duty of the Congress to send additional information to the Committee as soon as the results of the appeals are known. The Committee will probably be able to work better if it is posted with full information. We should also add that, if most people followed the same procedure or acted through the same lawyer, the results would be better. Whether or not this is possible, it is essential that people should inform the Secretaries of the Congress immediately. But even if the people do not send the information, the Congress should not stand still. The Secretaries  orother persons on behalf of the Congress should go from place to place collecting information. We should remember that the Europeans work united throughout the Colony and we should act in the same fashion.
 FEAR
 In this struggle we should have no fear. The Indian who concerns himself only with his own licence unmindful of what happens to others will be thought unmanly and a coward. It will be a great mistake for anyone to obtain a licence by flattery. It must be clearly understood that, if harm is caused by putting  one  trader against another, the jealous whites will not fail to exploit the situation. Such steps are outside the scope [of our objectives] and in the nature
 
 of underhand dealings.
 MEASURES CONCERNING OURSELVES
 Let us now consider measures in so far as they concern us. In this fight we must know for certain whether or not we are at fault. He who cannot see his own fault is doomed. [On the other hand,] that we may suffer even when there is nothing that can be said against us is contrary to experience. It is our duty to offer resistance by legitimate, constitutional means; it is also our duty to think of our own faults. In relation to the law, we are at fault on three points: (1) lack of cleanliness; (2) the bad state of account books; and (3) the location of residence and shop in the same premises.
 LACK OF CLEANLINESS
 In regard to lack of cleanliness, we must confess that, though we are not as bad as Europeans make us out to be, the charge is by and large justified. The phrase “lack of cleanliness” covers both the general appearance of the house and one’s personal appearance.
 CONDITION OF SHOP
 Very often the shop is found to be in a slovenly condition. The backyard is full of slush and dirt. Even the interior of the shop is sometimes dirty, and we are content that our shops should look like hovels. All this must change. It will be wise to give up all hope of carrying on trade anyhow, as we do in India, without giving much thought to the condition of the shop. If we cannot maintain our shop in as good a condition as the Europeans of better standing do, we do not deserve to be in trade. When they see our huts adjoining their well-kept shops, and see the same things being sold in our huts as in theirs, they are bound to feel a grudge against us. Let us not answer by asking if some Europeans do not also keep their shops untidy. No doubt they do, but we must never forget that, if we follow their example, we shall lose our case. We should not be surprised if they even expect more from us, for, after all? we belong to a different community.
 PERSONAL APPEARANCE
 We should be particular about our personal appearance also. A shopkeeper in rags cannot hold his own in Natal or South Africa. If you become a trader, you must dress according to local custom. It is not necessary to dress in the western fashion. But the dress, if in the Indian style, must be clean and decent. We would warn Indians that it
 is not proper to wear a dhoti in this country. In Tongaat shopkeepers and their assistants are seen cleaning their teeth and washing their faces in the street outside their shops, just as they do in our own country. It is sheer stupidity to believe that all these things will not prejudice the Europeans. When we make our appearance outside the house, we should always be fully dressed. [Among us] little attention is given to the condition of the turban or cap and the shoes. We assume that, if the head-dress is dirty, it is quite in keeping with custom. As a rule we do not polish our shoes, and some do not wear socks at all, or if at all they do, the socks are in tatters and double down over the shoes. All this must change. There is one key to all this. Personal activities, such as eating and drinking, washing and toilet, should be in private. That is, we should always be in a presentable condition while we are out. Similarly, we cannot attend a court or go out in public, chewing tobacco, betel-leaves or nuts.
 ACCOUNT BOOKS
 With regard to account books, complaints have appeared in newspapers that the books kept in English are unmethodical and disordered, or that they are false and are intended merely for show. We have to admit to our shame that the charge has some substance in it. Some simple-minded merchants go to the length of getting the books written up at the end of the year. How long can we go on with such patchwork? Indeed, we should wake up. It is not very difficult to keep regular books of account in English. The main reasons for not doing so would appear to be laziness and greed. We should overcome these weaknesses and start the practice of keeping regular accounts.
 SHOP AND RESIDENCE IN SAME PREMISES
 Many traders set up shop in residential  premises.  Europeans too do it. In the villages, one cannot help doing this to some extent. Wherever possible, the shop and the place of residence should be separate and at some distance from each other. Even  if  they  have  to be near each other, they must be separate. This  should  not  be done merely by putting up a nominal curtain with the intention of deceiving. They should be really kept distinct from each other.
 PROMISE
 If these three things are attended to, we can promise that the condition of the Indian traders in Natal will improve in a short time, Even if they do not change the law, it will not come into effect. One
 
 might ask what should be done to prevent shops being closed and locked up before all these wise precepts could be attended to. It is a pertinent question.
 FOR THE BRAVE ONLY
 Natal and South Africa are for brave Indians only. It is being proved every day that the coward and the miser are doomed. The answer, then, to the question is this: those merchants whose account books are in order, whose shops are clean and decent, whose dress is becoming and whose place of residence is clean and separate from the shop, will continue to run their shops even if they do not get the licence and lose the appeal. It will be possible to have their cases fought out in England and secure a favourable decision. It is certain that men of courage will be able to do all this.

 "
231,,“THE NATAL MERCURY” AND INDIAN TRADERS,"
    
 The Natal Mercury has come out in favour of Indian traders. The gist of its argument is that those who oppose Indian traders are hypocrites. This means that, though ostensibly they are opposed to Indians, they do in fact have dealings with us. The Mercury also believes that, if the Europeans are really opposed to the Indians, the latter cannot hold out for long. For, says The Mercury, it is only because Europeans sell land to Indians that the latter can buy it, and that it is because Europeans lend them money and buy goods from them that Indians can carry on trade. There is much force in this argument. It was on the basis of this that the Deputation to England argued with Lord Elgin and Mr. Morley that, if the Europeans were really opposed to the Indians, they could boycott the  matter.  We advise everyone to support the talk of boycott. It will probably bring about a breakdown of law. There are many things which Indians have to fight against, and if the laws made against us break down, we shall be able to cope with other problems on one condition, namely, that we overcome our drawbacks. On that point, we have written at  some length already, which readers may please look up.
 No one should be afraid of a boycott, for it is such that, if the Europeans start it, we cannot save ourselves in spite of any laws
 that may be made to protect us. The best thing for us will be to face it out. In Boksburg Europeans have no dealings with us, with the result that no Indian can go there though, under the law, every one has a right to do so. Where the Indian population is well settled, a boycott cannot be effective if we acquit ourselves well.

232,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 SELF-GOVERNMENT IN THE TRANSVAAL
 Lord Selborne has been re-appointed Governor of the Transvaal under the new Constitution. The post of Lieutenant-Governor has now been abolished altogether. Those desiring to contest the election to the new parliament will file their nomination papers with the respective magistrates on February 9. People will go to the polls on the 20th.
 WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT?
 It will not be out of place here to explain the significance of the change now introduced in the Transvaal. In the British Empire, there are three types of territories outside Great Britain, viz., self-governing colonies, Crown colonies and dependencies. India is among the dependencies. Crown colonies includeMauritius,Ceylon, etc. Natal, Canada, Australia, etc., are among the self-governing colonies.
 In a Crown colony there is generally a legislative body either elected by the people or nominated by the government. Officials are appointed only by the government, the legislature has no con-trol over them and they are in no way responsible to the members. All laws are regarded as having been enacted by the government.
 Self-government is said to have been conferred on a people when power is transferred to it and it acquires the authority to appoint officers, levy taxes and enact laws. The British control over self- governing colonies is very slight. Their legislation requires Royal assent, but if the Crown should refuse the assent, there is always the probability that these countries may declare their  independence.  Many experienced politicians believe that self-governing colonies will become independent in a few years. Till recently the Transvaal was a Crown Colony, but it has now become self-governing. Under it the
 members elected by the people can question the doings  of  the officials; it is therefore also called responsible government.
 ELECTION CAMPAIGN
 The election campaign has gone on for some weeks now. At the meetings sometimes they almost come to blows. Voters at times ask such absurd questions that one wonders whether such an election should be considered a sign of civilization or barbarism. Mr. Hosken is a rich, noble and well-known gentleman of this place. His opponent can in no way be considered his equal. The electors do not seem to have considered whether Mr. Hosken is a man likely to do good or harm to the public. They asked him the question where he obtained his provisions from. One need not be surprised if the fate of Hosken’s election should hang on the answer to this question. The electors are in such a benighted condition. This is only an example or  the  questions asked. One can cite many more instances.
 LAW RELATING TO NON-WHITES IN ORANGE RIVER COLONY
 A Bill, intended to protect the rights of the Coloured people through a white, appointed to represent them, has been published in the Orange River Colony Government Gazette. Many municipalities have, according to Press telegrams received here,  opposed  the measure. The right which the Government proposed to grant was without any substance. But the white members of the brave municipa- lities of the Orange River Colony have opposed it as they were afraid that the Coloured people were being accorded a respectable status by the grant of this right, such as it was. It is very disturbing to think what the plight of the Coloured people would be under such men.
 DR. PEREIRA’S SON
 Dr. Pereira, who is working here as a private interpreter, has a son studying in England. He has passed his school examination and got a certificate for being the best behaved among the students. He will shortly proceed to Scotland to study medicine.
 SIR RICHARD SOLOMON
 On Monday Sir Richard Solomon made a speech at a crowded meeting in the Pretoria Town Hall. I cannot give a full account of that speech this time, but intend doing so next week.libtech_311_footnoteHe has now spoken
 
 out his mind. Regarding the Asiatic Ordinance, he gave out that the Imperial Government would give its assent to the Ordinance if it was passed by the new parliament. The only inference to be drawn from this is that the Ordinance will certainly be passed in six or seven months. In that case it is probable that Indians will have yet to go and “enjoy life in the prison-palace”. However, I shall discuss this point further next week.
 INTERNAL FEUDlibtech_312_footnote
 A long telegram from the Durban correspondent of The Star states that a split has occurred in the local Indian community. It adds that the Congress is regarded as belonging to the Muslims, and that the Colonial-born or civilized Indians, being displeased, are thinking of founding a separate body. It is suspected that there must be some white person behind all this. From the wording of the telegram it appears that the writer is anxious to create dissensions among Indians. People in Durban may know more about this.
 ASIATIC ORDINANCE
 It is clear from the local newspapers that the Asiatic Ordinance of the Transvaal is not dead, but is only in a state of coma. At a meeting in Krugersdorp it was suggested that the matter should be taken up again in the Municipal Association; and as soon as the new government is formed, the Municipal Assoc iation should pass and forward a resolution [to demand] that the selfsame Ordinance be passed by the new legislature, and that Lord Elgin should give his assent to it. Such discussions have been going on not only at Krugers dorp, but throughout the Transvaal. The Indian community therefore needs to remain alert. People seem to have gone to sleep, elated by the rejection of the Ordinance; we should be wide awake.

  "
233,,ETHICAL RELIGION- IV,"
    
 CHAPTER IV: IS THERE A HIGHER LAW?
 We constantly pronounce judgements upon the value of actions. Some actions satisfy us and others do not. Whether a certain act is good or bad does not depend upon whether it is beneficial or harmful to us. In judging it, we adopt quite a different standard. We have in our minds certain ideas and on the basis of those we judge the acts of others. Whether any wrong done by one to another affects us or not, we do feel it to be wrong. Sometimes we have a trace of sympathy for the wrongdoer; but despite that sympathy, we feel no hesitation at all in pronouncing his act to be wrong. It may be that at times our judgement is found to be mistaken. We cannot always fathom a man’s motives, and may thus judge him wrongly. Neverth-eless, we find no difficulty in judging an act in so far as the intention is known. Even if our personal interests are sometimes served by wrong actions, we do feel inwardly that they are wrong.
 Thus it is established that the rightness or wrongness of an act does not depend upon a man’s self-interest. Nor does it depend upon his wishes. There is a difference between morality and sympathy. Out of sympathy for the child we wish to give it a certain thing, but if the thing is harmful to the child, we hold it immoral to give it. It is doubtless good  to show sympathy but, unrestricted by moral considerations, it turns into poison.
 We see also that moral laws are immutable. Opinions change, but not morality. When our eyes are open, we see the sun; when they are closed, it is not seen. The change here has been in our sense of sight, not in the fact of the sun’s existence. The same holds true of moral laws. It is probable that in a state of ignorance we do not know what is moral; but once the eye of knowledge is opened, there is no difficulty in knowing it. Men rarely care to see single-mindedly the right or wrong of things; often prompted by personal considerations, they mistakenly describe the immoral as moral. The time is yet to come when men, freeing themselves from self-regarding considerations, will concentrate their attention on the ideas of morality alone. Moral culture is still in its mere infancy; it is as science was before the birth of a Bacon or a Darwin. Men were eager to know what the truth was. Instead of inquiring into morality, they have been hitherto engaged in
 discovering laws of nature—the laws of the earth’s motion, etc. Where do we find the disinterested student of mora-lity, patient and painstaking, who, setting aside his earlier superstitious notions, devotes his life to seeking only the ideal good? When men become as eager to explore the world of moral ideas as they are now to explore the realms of nature, we shall be able to bring together the various conceptions of morality. It is unlikely that, on ideas of morality, there will be the same divergence of opinion as exists among men on  matters  of science. However, we may not for a time arrive at  unanimity  of opinion regarding moral laws. This does not, however, mean that it is impossible to distinguish between right and wrong.
 We thus see that, independent of and apart from men’s wishes and opinions, there is something like a moral standard which we may call moral law. If there are laws of the state, why may not there be a moral law too? It does not matter if that law is not committed to writing by man, and indeed it need not be. If we grant or hold that the moral law exists, it is incumbent on us to obey it, just as we ought to obey the law of the state. A moral law is distinct from and better than the laws of the state or those of business. One may ask, “How does it matter if I do not obey the laws of business and remain poor? Or if I disobey the laws of the state and incur the ruler’s displea-sure?” But it will never do —either for me or anyone else — to say, “What does it matter whether I tell a lie or tell the truth?”
 There is thus a great difference between moral laws and temporal laws. For morality dwells in our hearts. Even a man  practising immorality would admit that he has been immoral. A wrong can never become right. Even where a people is vile, though men may not observe the moral law, they would make a pretence of doing so; they thus are obliged to admit that moral laws ought to be observed. Such is the greatness of morality. It cares not for custom nor for public opinion. To a moral man, public opinion or custom is binding only so long as it is in harmony with the moral law.
 Where does this moral law come from? This law is not laid down by the state, for different laws are found in different states. Many men were opposed to the morality which Socrates observed in his day. Even so the world admits that the morality he observed has remained, and shall remain, morality for ever. Robert Browning says, ‘If ever Satan proclaimed the law of hatred and untruth in the world, even then
 justice, goodness and truth will continue to be divine.”libtech_313_footnoteOne may conclude from this that the moral law is supreme and divine.
 Such a law no people or individual can violate to the end of time. As has been said, even as the dangerous storm ultimately passes, immoral men must meet their destruction.libtech_314_footnote
 No sooner did the cup of sin in Assyria and Babylon become full than it broke. When Rome trod the path of immorality, none of her great men could save her. The ancient Greeks were an accom- plished people, still all their art and philosophy could not continue in their immorality for long. The French Revolution was but an insurrec- tion against immorality. The same was the case with America. The good Wendell Phillips used to say that immorality even if enthroned will not endure. This mysterious moral law brings prosperity to the man who observes it: it sustains the family that obeys it, and the community which lives by it ever flourishes. Freedom, peace and happiness are the lot of the nation that lets itself be ruled by this highest law.libtech_315_footnote

 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 
Your letter to hand.
 As a lot of material has been held over, Mrs. Besant’s articlelibtech_317_footnotemay well be postponed to next week. Whenever you print it, see that all of it appears in one issue. It may conveniently be held over for two weeks.It would be better if the article on the Amirlibtech_318_footnotewere concluded in this issue.
 The suggestion about decreasing your burden is quite justified. Do keep Mothoo. You would be quite right if you  had  already  decided to keep him before this reached you.
 This is the time for you to give your fullest attention to realizing the dues and to the account books. We must on any account satisfy
 
 
 our customers. If they do not get satisfaction just when they have begun to be interested in what we write, we shan’t be able to keep them on the register. It is [however] as necessary to collect the dues as it is to satisfy our customers. You must therefore give full attention to the books. I realize this quite well.
 You will be justified therefore if you have decided to keep Thakkar by offering him an increment. He can be cured of his bad habit if you keep an eye on him.
When will the balance-sheet be ready?
 I am returning Sheth Haji Habib’s advertisement about the mosque. I have written to him. I hope you remember that £6.10.0 have already been collected from him. A credit note for the amount has been sent to him.
 I am sending you some more material today. Do not hold over anything that is topical.
 Even though the expenditure on your visit to England is ultimately to be borne by the Press, I know that the money will have to be found by me now, and this is how I look at the matter.
 The Press is growing day by day. Its work will increase as the purity of our objectives is progressively recognized and increases. If this purity is accompanied by skill and ability, we shall be able to do a great deal, provided of course that we do not succumb to greed and self-interest. For this we should lay down that no one among us could draw a monthly allowance of more than £10 or up to any other limit we decide upon. Whatever is left over after these charges have been met, we should use to promote education, health, etc. In order to do this we should ourselves be better educated. I have therefore decided to send a person to England, whom I consider the most steadfast of all. He should go there with the firm resolve that he would not make a single pie for himself from the education he receives, but would pass on all the benefit [of that education] to the Press and would accept and live on what the Press gave him. You appear to me to be the only Indian who has attained to this degree of fitness. I believe you understand the significance of the whole thing and you seem to be the only person who can be depended upon to carry forward the heritage of my thoughts and words. Messrs Polak and West know and understand a lot. There are things which they understand and you don’t. However, it seems on the whole that you understand more than
 they do. Our ultimate capital is not the money we have, but our courage, our faith, our truthfulness and our ability. If therefore you go to England, your intellect remains unspoiled and you return with your physical and mental powers strengthened, our capital will have appreciated to that extent. I cannot write more as people have again begun to drop in.

 [Before January 29 1907] Mr. Madanjit has started, in Rangoon,  an English  journal entitled United Burma of which we have received the first few issues.
His aim in starting the paper is to bring together the Burmese people
 and seek the redress of their grievances from the Government. Through the paper he also hopes to persuade the Burmese people to take part in the activities of the [Indian National] Congress. This is no doubt a great venture by Mr. Madanjit, to which every one will wish godspeed. From the large number of advertisements which it has been able to secure from Englishmen as well as Indians, it would seem that the paper enjoys a wide patronage. The address of the paper is No. 29, 27th Street, Rangoon; the annual subscription is Rs. 6; the price of a copy is three annas. Mr. Madanjit himself is Editor.

CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
Yours to hand.
 I enclose herewith Desai’s letter. If Mothoo has not yet come and if you know Nathalal and consider him suitable for our work, write to Desai. I have written to him asking him to write to you. We must have one person well trained before you leave. It would be nice if this could be Maganlal.libtech_320_footnote
 I have thought of the Bar for you. If you have to say anything about it or suggest something else, do write to me. There is likely to be one difficulty in your going [to study] for the Bar, namely, it will entail an additional expenditure of £150. If we decide that you should study law, you can take the LL.B. degree of London University. Please let me know what you think about all these things.
 I received the Pretoria list yesterday and have sent it to Gaurishankar.
 I have already written to you to postpone printing Mrs. Besant’s
 
 articlelibtech_321_footnote. It would not matter if it appeared next week.
I have written earlier about Madanjit too.libtech_322_footnote
 I send herewith the letter about drinking after making  corrections; you may print it.libtech_323_footnote
 I am trying to find Urdu poems bearing on Ethical Religion. I have not yet come across any. I hope to send one next week. The first poem you have sent to me does not strike me as appropriate. We want to give poems which do not start a controversy.
 I shall be able to send a reply if the letter, about the Colonial Secretary is sent to me. Please send the Act along with the letter.
 I am sending a demand draft for £35 in favour of you and West. It is good that Anandlallibtech_324_footnotehas got started.
 I have already written all I had to say about Thakkar. If he goes away, I believe we shall be losing a very good hand. On the whole, Ithink he is all right; and we shall not be able to get another man as well informed in the near future. However, you may let him go if he does not stay even on £5.
 Please let me know where Maganlal bought the type in Bombay, and in what condition it was received here. Also let me know if there would be any objection to our getting the type this time from the Gujarati Foundry.
 I came to know from Harilal yesterday that the money had not been paid for the tea we bought from Sanghavi nor was the bill credited to him in our books. Please tell me what you know about this, and pay up the bill for the tea if it has not been already paid.
 I have sent Manilal the Sanskrit book he wanted. What does he propose to do with it? Please let me know how he is getting on with his studies, how he is working in the Press, etc.

 JOHANNESBURG
 January 31, 1907
 MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,
 I have your-letter and the list. We have to publish,  on  Mr. Adamji Miankhan’slibtech_325_footnotedeparture, his photograph as a supplement, and we have also to give a brief account of his life. The account I shall send from here. I have asked Mr. Adamji to let us have  his photograph. He will send one on to you there. As soon as it arrives, you should have the block made, so that we can make use of it when necessary and may not be rushed.
 I should like you to let me have the total of complimentary copies and the total of exchanges we send, dividing [them] into two heads, complimentary copies and exchanges for Natal, and [those for places] outside Natal. The receipts for January are not quite bad. In the expenditure for the month, you have not shown the wages at all. Has the balance-sheet been started?
 Who is to form the riddles, before we can think of prizes? Personally, I am of the opinion that we are not yet ripe for branching out in this direction.
 What prescription has Dr. Nanji given for Kalyandas, and what reason does he assign for the sores on the hands?
 I have duly received your list of advertisers for Johannesburg. They have all consented to pay. Chhotabhai has already paid; you must have received the Credit Note. Please inquire and let me know whether you have or not. The others will pay. You may, therefore, continue the advertisements.
 It would be very good if you could collect the £3 from Mrs. Jamieson. I feel that I should refund the £3 to Vyas. Henceforth, you should not give notes of introduction to men in whom you cannot put a reasonable trust.
 Do not overwork yourself. What about Mothoo? I have not yet received the Parsee Chronicle or the Patrika. The names  of subscribers against which you have put a cross should be retained
 
 until you hear further from me. The others may be struck off. I will, however, inquire.
 I am glad you had the meeting on Sunday. How did the ladies take it? What did they understand? What pains were taken to explain to them what was read? Who gave the explanations? Where was the meeting held? It is a step absolutely in the right direction? and should be continued at any cost.
 Yours sincerely

240,,INDIANS IN THE TRANSVAAL,"
    
 We invite the attention of every Indian to the speech by Sir Richard Solomon translated into Gujarati by our Johannesburg correspondent.libtech_326_footnoteWhen Sir Richard makes a public speech, we should know that it is not for electioneering purposes only. He has just  returned from England. He has met officials in the Colonial Office in London, and he is a favourite of theirs. Through him, the Liberal Government desires to unite the Dutch and the English. It is necessary, therefore, to look upon whatever Sir Richard says at this juncture as important.
 Sir Richard says that the Asiatic Ordinance will have to be reintroduced in the new parliament, and that the Imperial Government will not reject an act passed by it.
 Not only would Sir Richard have such a law passed, but, according to his line of thinking, no new Indian should beallowed to enter and settle in the Transvaal. Sir Richard does not therefore like the Natal or the Cape immigration laws. He would have the Orange River Colony lawlibtech_327_footnoteenacted in the Transvaal. This means that, if the reins of government were to pass into the hands of Sir  Richard,  Indians would face very hard times indeed.
 What are we to do in this situation? We have only one answer. We have hailed the refusal of assent to the Asiatic Ordinance as a victory. But true victory will come only when we show our strength. It is
 
 certain that the Asiatic Ordinance will be re-introduced. When that happens, there should be only one thought in the mind of every Indian: never to accept such a law. And, if it is enforced, he will rather go to gaol than carry a pass like a Kaffir. True victory will be won only when the entire Indian community courageously marches to the gaol—when the time comes—and stays there as if it were a palace.
 Many things have to be done before this can come to pass. We must show that Indians without permits do not enter the Transvaal in large numbers. If any of them try to enter, they must be stopped from doing so. And the whites must be made to realize that their policy of repression is not at all called for.

 Mr. Theodore Morison, who is a member of the South Africa British Indian Committee, has now been appointed a member of the India Council by Mr. Morley. Mr. Morison was the Principal of the Aligarh College. On some matters he holds liberal views. He comes of a noble family. This appointment made by Mr. Morley is a novel step. So far, all the members of this Council have invariably been Anglo- Indian officials, but Mr. Morison is not from that class. This musttherefore be regarded as a major change made by Mr. Morley in the set-up of the Council.

243,,NAUSEA,"
    
 
 Generally speaking, every person has an aversion to something or the other. To some the sight of blood or pus is nauseating, to others the smell of kerosene. Similarly, an Englishman is averse to certain things. Of these aversions some are desirable, but others are carried too far. None the less, it is a fact that people do have these aversions. Trivial as some of these may seem, we should know what they are. It often happens that, starting from trifles, people go on to big quarrels. Because of trifles the whites sometimes cause havoc. We know of an instance in which a white man kicked an Indian simply because the latter happened to break wind. Once Mr. Miller, a Magistrate of the Amlazi Court, was so sickened at the sight of an Indian witness hiccuping that he could stand it no longer and asked the Indian to stop. Once an Indian and some Europeans were at  dinner  table. During the meal the Indian started belching. An English lady at the table almost fainted and could not eat at all that day. We can see from these instances how necessary it is for us always to show consideration for the feelings of others. Also, while we live in this country,  we should so behave that the whites’ prejudices against us are weakened. With this end in view, we list below some of the causes of their prejudice and appeal to all Indians to overcome them.
 SOME DON’TS
  Avoid, 	as far 	as possible, 	blowing your 	nose or spitting 	on swept 	or paved 	walks or in the presence 	of others. 
 On hygienic grounds also, this rule is worth observing. Doctors say that sometimes serious diseases are caused by contact with the nasal or oral discharge of another. Dr. Murison has said that we often spread tuberculosis through our habit of spitting anywhere. Both these things should be done into a spittoon while at home, and into a handkerchief while out, and, as far as possible, in privacy.
  One 	should not 	belch, hiccup, break 	wind, or scratch 	oneself in 	the presence 	of others. 
 These [maxims] are useful for correct social behaviour. By practice one can learn to check one’s instinct to do any of these things.
 If 	you want 	to cough, do 	so holding 	your handkerchief 
 against the mouth.
 If one’s spittle gets blown on to others, it annoys them and if one has any disease, the spittle carries it to them.
  Even 	after a 	bath, in 	many men, some dirt 	remains in 	the ears 	or under the 	nails. It 	is necessary to 	pare one’s nails and 	keep them as 	well as the ears clean.  Those 	who do not 	grow a regular 	beard should, 	if necessary, 	shave every day. An unshaven face is a sign of laziness or stinginess.  One 	should not 	let mucus accumulate 	in the 	corners of 	the eyes. 	One who allows 	this to happen 	is considered 	slothful and 	a sleepyhead. Every act of cleaning the body should be done in privacy.  The 	turban or 	cap and the shoes 	should be clean. 	The life 	of the 	shoes is 	prolonged by 	cleaning and polishing.  Those 	who chew 	betel-leaf and 	nut should do 	so at fixed 	hours, as 	with other kinds of 	food so 	as to avoid giving the 	impression that 	we are 	eating all 	the time. Those who 	chew tobacco have 	a lot 	to think 	about. They disfigure every spot by 	spitting. Addicts to 	tobacco, as 	the Gujarati 	proverb goes, spoil the 	corner of 	the house 	where they chew 	tobacco, the 	whole house if 	they smoke 	and their 	clothes if they 	take snuff. 
 These are rules for personal cleanliness. Later we shall write of those relating to the home and its environs.

244,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 
 SIR RICHARD SOLOMON’S SPEECH
 I have already written of Sir Richard Solomon’s election speechlibtech_328_footnote at Pretoria on January 21 and said I would give, in translation, his ideas on Coloured persons. I do so today.
 
 ASIATIC ORDINANCE
 Now I come to the question of Asiatics, which is related to that of the Kaffirs. Most of the Asiatics in this territory are Indians who have entered lawfully and secured their rights in a similar fashion. There are also those who have entered by breaking the law. Let them be punished for that. (Applause.) But the lawful immigrants are entitled to justice as well as to recognition, and they should get them. They should not be deprived of rights lawfully acquired. It is therefore necessary to maintain a complete register of the lawful immigrants. Moreover registration is necessary not only to protect the interests of those who are here by virtue of their legal right, but also to prevent the immigration of those who may in future be prohibited. With this end in view a law was passed by the Legislative Council, but it failed to receive the assent of the Imperial Government, as the Indian community raised unreasonable objections to it. This is quite understandable for the Imperial Government has a great responsibility in relation to India. As long, therefore, as the reins of power in this Colony are in the hands of the Imperial Government, it is clear that they will not assent to such an act.
 “PASS LAW AGAIN”
 But we can [now] pass a law similar to the previous one. I am sure the Imperial Government will give their consent to a similar bill-passed by a self-governing colony.
 OTHER ACTS
 Some may ask what should be done about Indian immigration in the future. The English traders in this Colony hold that the Indians, who have a different way of life and who enter into unfair competition with them, should be prohibited from entering and trading in the Transvaal. They are afraid that they will be ruined by the immigration of such men. I sympathize with this line of thinking. Hence I believe that the parliament of this Colony should, as early as possible, enact a measure to restrict Indian immigration. The model for such a law is to be had in the Cape or Natal.
 ARE NOT CAPE AND NATAL LAWS ENOUGH?
I have given much thought to this question; and I think
 
 that, if we adopt the laws of the Cape Colony and Natal, the immigration of ordinary coolies will discontinue, but the immigration of those whom you really wish to keep out, namely, the traders, will not stop. If, therefore, we adopt the Cape or the Natal Act, we shall have to add to it the further provision that the immigrant Asiatic cannot carry on trade.
 SIR RICHARD’S REMEDY
 I wish to speak frankly on this question. Personally I would prefer it that Indians were not allowed to come into the Colony at all. A concession may be made in favour of only  those coming on a short visit. It is much better not to allow  any Indians to come in rather than allow them in and then to suppress them, leading to a clash between the local and the Imperial Governments. I am therefore of the view that we should pass an act similar to the one in force in the Orange River Colony. It was enacted before the Boer War and the Imperial Government did not oppose it. In passing the measure we  should provide for the continued stay of lawful immigrants and the protection of the rights acquired by them.
 JOHANNESBURG CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
 The Johannesburg Chamber has issued a statement giving the causes of the starvation now prevalent in Johannesburg. Competition from the Indian trader is mentioned as one of them. In his speechlibtech_329_footnotea few months ago, Mr. Quinn had shown that it was no use blaming the Indian trader. But the Chamber’s sole business at present is to rouse public opinion against Indians as much as possible.
 INDIANS GOING TO DELAGOA BAY
 News having been received of the ill-treatment of Indians going from the Transvaal to Delagoa Bay, an inquiry was made of the Portuguese Consul. In his reply he says that no further disability has been imposed; that, if any regulations were framed recently, they have not been published in the Gazette, and that an Indian going from the Transvaal has no difficulty. The hardship brought to our notice was that Indians from the Transvaal were detained at the border if they did
 
 not hold a pass for Delagoa Bay similar to the Natal pass. Further correspondence with the Consul is going on, and another detailed letter from him is expected.
 EAST INDIA ASSOCIATION
 The Transvaal Leader today publishes a cable from England reporting the annual meeting of the East India Association presided over by Sir Raymond West. A speaker at the meeting pointed out that Indians suffered no hardships in places like Jamaica, because the  whites there belonged to good families and were respectable people. In those places a considerable income could be earned by good, capable Indians, free from any bad habits. Commenting on this, Sir Raymond West said that there could be no comparison between Jamaica and South Africa, for the whites in South Africa were hostile to the Indians because they suffered from Indian competition. Sir Raymond concluded by saying that one of the remedies for Indian hardships in South Africa was that every Indian should receive adequate education. Sir Raymond means to suggest that, if we are educated, the displeasure of the whites may lessen, for in that case we should be copying their way of life.

245,,ETHICAL RELIGION–V,"
    
 
 CHAPTER V: MORALITY AS A RELIGION
 The subject of this chapter may strike one as strange. The common idea is that morality and religion are distinct things; still this chapter seeks to consider morality as a religion. Some readers may think the writer guilty of confusion. That reproach may come from two sides— from those who regard religion as more than morality, and from others who think that, where there is morality, there is no need for religion. Yet the author’s intention is to show their close relationship. The societies spreading ethical religion or religious ethics believe in religion through morality.
 The common idea, it may be admitted, is that there may be morality without religion and religion without morality. One comes across many men of immoral conduct who claim to be religious in
 
 spite of the sinful acts they commit. On the other hand, there are moral men like the late Mr. Bradlaugh, who are proud to call themselves atheists and would run away from the name of religion. Those who hold either of these views are mistaken. Those who hold the first view are not only mistaken, but also dangerous  as  they practise immorality under the guise of religion. In this chapter, there fore, we shall show that, considered intellectually and scientifically, religion and morality are united and should be so united.
 Morality was in the beginning simply the customary conduct of a community, settled ways of acting that men living together naturally fell into. By a natural process the good customs tended to survive and the bad ones to die out, since, if the bad ones did not die out, they would weaken the community and lead to its extinction. Even today we see this process at work. It is neither morality nor religion if people observe good customs more or less unthinkingly. However, most of what passes for morality in the world today consists, as pointed out above, of good customs.
 Moreover, men often have a merely superficial idea of religion. Sometimes men believe in religion only as a means to  ward  off dangers that threaten them. It would be a mistake to dignify actions as religious where they are performed out of a love that springs from fear.
 But at long last a time does come when men begin to tread the path of morality consciously, deliberately with a determined will, regardless of gain or loss, of life or death, without turning to look back, ready to sacrifice themselves. Then can they be said to have been permeated with true morality.
 How can such morality subsist except with the support of religion? One tells oneself, “If by doing a little harm to another, I can secure my personal interest, why should I not do that little harm?” The profit derived from doing harm is no profit, but a positive loss [to the doer]. How shall this unpalatable dose go down one’s throat? Ostensibly in Germany’s interest, Bismarck perpetrated dreadful deeds. Where then was his education? Where did those maxims of morality disappear which, at other times, he used to mouth before school children? Obviously, a reply to all these questions  can  be given. The reason why he could not keep up his morality in the face of these difficulties was that his morality was not grounded in religion. So long as the seed of morality is not watered by religion, it cannot
 sprout. Without water it withers and ultimately perishes. Thus it will be seen that true or ideal morality ought to include true religion. To put the same thought differently, morality cannot be observed without religion. That is to say, morality should be observed as a religion.
 Furthermore, it is seen that the rules of morality, laid down in the world’s great religions, are largely the same. The founders of thereligions have also explained that morality is the basis of religion. If a foundation is removed, the superstructure falls to the ground; similarly if morality is destroyed, religion which is built on it comes crashing down.
 The author adds that there is nothing wrong in calling morality a religion. Dr. Coit in his prayer says, “I shall have no other God except righteousness.” On reflection, we shall realize that God will not help us and answer our impassioned prayer for help, if we utter His name, while having a dagger concealed under our arm. Let us take two men, one who believes in the existence of God, yet breaks all His Commandments; and another who, though not acknowledging God by name, worships Him through his deeds and obeys His laws, recognizing in the divine laws, their Maker. Which of the two men shall we call a man of religion and morality? Without a moment’s thought, one would emphatically reply that the second man alone is to be considered religious and moral.libtech_330_footnote

N. 4695           [Before 	February 5, 1907]libtech_333_footnote  	Mr. Adamji Miankhan sailed home on the 7th. His services to the 	Indian community should be an example to all Indian traders. His 	portrait is published in this issue. Mr. Adamji comes of a  noble 	family. His ancestors carried on a business in brocades and many 	varieties of cloth. In 1884, when he was eighteen, he came to South 	Africa along with his brother, Mr. Gulam Hussain, and his father, 	Mr. Miankhan. He had had some English education which proved very 	useful.  	It was really in 1896-7 that the Indian community had the occasion 	to benefit from his public services. It was not long after the      
 Congress had been founded, and its first Secretary was to leave for India. The problem then arose of who was to take his place. But thanks to his knowledge of English and his tact and competence, Mr. Adamji was unanimously appointed Acting Secretary. At this time Mr. Abdul Karim Haji Amod Zaveri was the President. Within six months of their assumption of office the funds of the Congress rose from
 £100 to £1100. The members also in those days were full of enthusiasm. They used to travel long distances in their own carriages to collect funds. And the whole community now enjoys the fruits of the work they did at that time. Most of the credit for this work goes to Mr. Adamji; no society can progress unless its secretary is alert and has drive. But it was in December of 1896 and January of 1897 that Adamji’s tact and ability were clearly seen. At that time the passengers from s.s. Courland and s.s. Naderi had a difficult time in landing at Durban.libtech_334_footnoteThe whites were opposed to their landing and were determined at all costs to prevent it. The occasion called for great self- restraint, a quick judgement and patience. Mr. Adamji showed all  these virtues. He worked day and night, at the cost of his own business, to ward off the looming misery. It was at this time that the late Mr. Nazar came to South Africa and rendered valuable help. However, if Mr. Adamji had not shown that grit and tenacity, the happy ending could never have come about.
 From the time of the above crisis until the present day, Mr. Adamji has always done public work to the best of his capacity and has given the benefit of his experience to Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri and Mr. Mahomed Cassim Anglia who are now Joint Secretaries. We pray to God that Mr. Adamji may realize his wishes in his native land and return in good health for public work here; and we wish that other leading Indian citizens will follow Mr. Adamji’s example.

 CHAPTER VI: RELIGIOUS MORALITY OR MORAL RELIGION DARWIN’S VIEWS ON ETHICS
 Before summarizing this chapter, it is necessary to give an account first of Darwin himself. Darwin was a great Englishman of the last century who made great scientific discoveries. His memory andhis power of observation were amazing. He has written some books which deserve to be read and pondered. With a mass of evidence and arguments, he has shown how man came into being; how he has evolved from a particular kind of monkey. After a large number of experiments and much sifting of evidence, he realized that there was not much difference between the anatomy of man and that of the ape. Whether this conclusion is correct or not has not much to do with ethics. Besides this, Darwin has also shown how ideas of morality affect mankind. And as many scholars have faith in Darwin’s writings, our author has dealt with his views in Chapter VI.
 CHAPTER VI
 It is noble voluntarily to do what is good and right. The true sign of man’s nobility is the fact that, instead of being driven about like a cloud before the wind, he stands firm and can do, and in fact does, what he deems proper.
 Nevertheless, we ought to know the direction in which our environment disposes our instincts. We know that we are not in every way masters of our own life; there are conditions outside of us to which we have to adjust ourselves. For instance, in a country where Himalayan cold prevails, we have to put on adequate clothing, whether we like it or not, in order to keep the body warm. That is, we have to act with prudence.
 The question now arises: does the influence of environment lead us to be moral? Or can it be that the forces that surround us are indifferent to morality?
 At this point it becomes necessary to consider Darwin’s views. Though Darwin did not write as a moral philosopher, he has shown
 
 how close the connection is between morality and environment. Those who think that morality is unimportant and that physical strength and mental capacity are the only things that matter should read Darwin. According to him, there is an instinct of self-preservation in men as in other creatures. He also says that those who survive the struggle for existence may be regarded as successful, that is, those who are unfit tend to extinction, but that the issue of the struggle does not depend on mere physical force.
 Comparing man with the bear or the buffalo, we find that, in physical strength, the bear and the buffalo are superior to him; in a tussle he will surely be worsted. Nonetheless he is their superior by virtue of his intelligence. Similarly we can compare different races of men. In war it is not the side with the largest numbers or with the hardiest soldiers that wins, but the side with the ablest generals and the best strategy, though its soldiers may be fewer or less hardy. In these examples we see the superiority of intelligence.
 But Darwin shows further that moral strength is even superior to physical and intellectual strength; and we can see in various ways thata man who has moral qualities lasts longer than one who is devoid of them. Some hold that Darwin taught that strength is enough; that is, those who are physically strong ultimately  survive.  Superficial thinkers may believe that morality is of no use. But this  is  not Darwin’s view at all. We find from the evidence of the early history of man that races without morality have completely disappeared. The people of Sodom and Gomorrah were extremely immoral and they are now therefore completely extinct. We can see even today how races without morality are steadily declining.
 Let us now take some simple illustrations and see how at least common morality is necessary for sustaining the human race. A peaceful disposition is one element of morality. At first sight it may appear that people with a violent disposition rise in life; but a little reflection will show that, when the sword of violence falls, it may be on one’s own neck. Freedom from bad habits forms another element of morality. Statistics have proved that, at the age of thirty, intemperate persons in England are not likely to live beyond another thirteen or fourteen years, while the teetotaller’s expectation of life is seventy years. Yet another element of morality is chastity. Darwin has shown that profligate persons die early. They have no children, or if they have any, they are weak. The profligate become feeble of mind, and
 in course of time look like idiots.
 If we consider the morals of various communities, we find the same state of affairs. Among the Andaman islanders the  husband looks after his wife only until their child is weaned and begins to move about, and he then abandons her. That is, they do not have the quality of altruism, and utter selfishness prevails. The result is that the race is gradually dying out. Darwin shows that the altruistic instinct is present, to some extent, even in animals: timid birds display strength in defending their young. This shows that, if there had been no selflessness among animals, we should have in the world scarcely any life other than grass and poisonous flora. The main distinction between man and other animals is that man is more selfless than the animals. He has sacrificed his life for others in proportion to his strength, that is, for his offspring, for his family, his community and his country.
 Darwin clearly shows that moral strength is supreme. The ancient Greeks had greater intelligence than the Europeans of today, but when the former gave up morality, their intelligence became their enemy, and no trace of them remains today. Nations are sustained neither by wealth nor by armies, but by righteousness alone. It is the duty of man to bear this truth in mind and practise altruism, which is the highest form of morality.

 February 5, 1907
 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 I post to you today, with the necessary clarification, the papers you had sent me for my comments. I also  send  some  Gujarati material, which has to be printed in this very issue. What I have written about Adamji Shethlibtech_336_footnotemay appear some time later if he is not leaving just yet. I have suggested presenting him with an address. If one is presented to him by the Congress, I expect to get a separate report of
 
 it.libtech_337_footnote
It is good that the speeches of the Congress session have
 appeared in the Gujarati columns of the current issue. The biographi- cal sketch of the Amir ought not to have been postponed so long.
 I have not yet been able to get an Urdu poem for “Ethical Religion”. If you come across any there, do insert it. I had hoped to get some Urdu poem today. If you don’t find any, let the thing go without it, but do not insert any that applies to the Hindus alone. There is one song by Pritamdas in Kavyadohan beginning with the line, “O man, without caring to know the supreme ideal, you have hankered after your selfish ends only”. You may use it if  you  approve of it. If you can get Kabir’s bhajans, they will be quite unexceptionable.
 I hope to have a letter about Kalyandas and about other matters tomorrow.

250,"February 	6, 1907",LETTER TO TOWN CLERK,"
          JOHANNESBURG, 
  February 	6, 1907    TO  THE 	TOWN 	CLERK   O. BOX 		1047 JOHANNESBURG   SIR,    	The Committee of the British Indian Association has seen the draft 	of the by-laws for licensing and regulating Asiatic tea-rooms or 	eating-houses. My Committee respectfully submits the following  for     Indian 	Opinion, 9-2-1907. 
 the Council’s consideration, in connection with the by-laws.
 It appears that the necessity for the by-laws has  arisen  on account of the large, indentured Chinese population and the catering for that population which has been undertaken by various persons. But, under the definition of the term, “Asiatic tea-room or eating- house” is evidently included any place where Asiatics are catered for, and it would, therefore, include the small British Indian restaurants which are conducted in Johannesburg. They are very few, and have very few visitors, the British Indian population being all permanently resident, and not requiring any houses for feeding it. My Committee, therefore, ventures to suggest that the definition should not include those of British Indians. At the same time, my Committee has no desire to protect the few small British Indian restaurants in Johannesburg from inspection with regard to sanitation, etc., but, in the humble opinion of my Committee, the ordinary public health by- laws are sufficient for the purpose.
 In the humble opinion of my Committee, the procedure laid down for making application for a tea-room or an  eating-house licence is cumbersome and costly, and could only be justified if there were large remunerative establishments. The fee fixed for the annual licence, too, in my Committee’s humble opinion, is almost prohibitive, and is greater than the fee charged for either European restaurants or Kaffir eating-houses, the fee for the former being £7.10.0 only and for the latter £5. Moreover, the definition of an “Asiatic eating- house” includes a tea-room. Therefore, whilst a general tea-room carries with it a licence of £3, an Asiatic tea-room will require a licence fee of £10; and the fee of £2 for transfer of licences is, in my Committee’s humble opinion, a heavy charge.
 My Committee, therefore, ventures to trust that  the  Town Council will be pleased to favourably consider the objections herein raised to the proposed by-laws.
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servant, ABDOOL GANI CHAIRMAN,

 [JOHANNESBURG,]
 February 7, 1907
 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
Your letter reached me on the 4th.
 We are going to get the money for the advertisement of the Mahomedan estate. Please send the bill.
 I have received the bills sent by you. I shall now see how much can be realized.
 I did understand your suggestion about the riddles. I do not think it proper to introduce the riddles feature so long as we are not in  a position to have it regularly and offer prizes ourselves. What can be the object of the man who wants to spend money on this? How long can he be expected to do so? Moreover, we can hardly expect many to take part in the competition. However, you may inquire of your correspondent if he intends paying for the  prizes  indefinitely.  It would be very strange indeed if he wanted to do so. On the other hand, it would not be proper for us to start this feature if he agrees to give prizes once in a while. You may, however, write to me if you have more to say.
I follow what you say about Sanghavi.
 Mr. B. P. Ibrahim has not asked us to discontinue the advertisement. I shall ask him about it when he comes. I shall see about the customers whose names you have sent me.
 I am still trying to make arrangements for the Hamidia [Society] I know that Manilal is weak in his arithmetic. Please give him adequate attention.
 How much English has the new man studied? Who is he? Is he the son of an indentured labourer?
I shall be able to credit the money payable to Hirji Valji.
 Regarding the Anti-Indian Law Fund bill, Hemchand says it was paid in cash here.
 As the post will not reach me on Saturday evening, you need not bother about sending me proofs here. It will be enough if you let me know in your letter of Thursday what subjects have already been dealt with. It will enable me to know what topics I need not write about.
About your going to England, I think it is desirable, if you can
 
 go immediately. But your going depends mainly on your work there.
(I) When can you be conveniently free?
 Who 	will take care of 	your work in 	your absence? Will 	Harilal be able 	to look 	after the Gujarati columns? 
 I think the proper time for you to leave for England is when you can get away from the Press. When you think you can do so conveniently, you will first have to discuss it with all your colleagues and then write to me.
 That Kalyandas is leaving seems to me a calamity. I think you should as far as possible avoid going to town. Maganlal may go if he has the courage to undertake the work in town. Harilal should look after the Gujarati work and Maganlal should look after the accounts, that is, the original entries should be made by him. If, however, Maganlal cannot cope with the two jobs, and if West cannot do it, then I think your going will have to be put off for the present. You will then be able to leave only after I go there, that is, in the beginning of next year. I may be able to go there towards the end of this year. But if I do not, I can go there only in March next year; and your going will be postponed till then. I am thinking of sending for Kalyandas’s brother [from India]. Perhaps Gokolibtech_338_footnotetoo might come. But all this is uncertain. You have to consider whether or not you can leave, if Kalyandas is not there and no extra hand has been recruited. Think all this over and let me know. It would be better, I think, if you talked things over with West and wrote to me. What does he feel about it? If your visit to England Materializes, you will be unable to go to India. You may think of going to India on your way back. What you do must depend mainly on your choice.
 Though Harilal has agreed to stay, I find some uncertainty in what he writes. Therefore, I wrote to you to treat him in such a manner as to have a steadying influence on his mind.
 The poster is found useful here. It may prove useful there too if we can arrange to send a man regularly to town. Do not think any more of discontinuing it. Try to make the best use of the posters now that they have been printed. It is worth trying if Sanghavi, Omar Sheth and others exhibit the posters and also stock copies of Indian Opinion for sale. Ask Adams also. Some people in Maritzburg also might well
 
 stock these things. But all this requires time.
 It is absolutely necessary to fix a particular amount per month so that nobody draws more. The better course would be to inform me every month how much each one has drawn, so that I can write to those who have [over]drawn. Or you may discuss the matter with Anandlal.
 I feel the balance-sheet should now be made ready  without  delay. If Kalyandas can leave in April, please assign Maganlal mainly to this job and get it done by that time.
 Please see what I have written to West yesterday about Sam Sardar’s son who wants to stay there.
     [PS.]  Blessings 	from  MOHANDAS     In the 	printed list for Johannesburg which you sent, Mr. Ally’s "
252,,SOUTH AFRICA BRITISH INDIAN COMMITTEE,"
 name 	is crossed. Why? Please find out and let me know.  	Please send the paper to the following address if it is not already 	going there: Joseph Royeppen, 36, Stapleton Hall Road, Strand Green, N. 	London.  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati original in Gandhiji’s hand: S. N. 	4697         	We publish today in another section an article on the South Africa 	British Indian Committee. The article shows that the Committee is 	working hard and will be able to do really effective work, if it 	receives help from South Africa.  	The main thing that we can do is to support it through agitation. 	The Grand Old Man of India too has given the same advice. It is not 	enough that we feel the pain; our cry must be loud enough  to 	communicate that pain. Even as a mother, as the saying goes, does 	not serve [food] unasked, we must know that, unless we agitate at 	this end, nothing will happen and we shall not be able to avail 	ourselves of all the help that the Committee can give.  	Our position would deteriorate if, having brought the Committee into 	existence, we failed to support it. For those who help us do so on 	the [implicit] understanding that we deserve the help. We must 	support 
 the Committee by providing the funds. We cannot make up the deficit for this year unless we send them the £300 we promised. We should continue to finance the Committee until a solution is found for our problems.
The Committee has to deal with the four following problems:
 (1) the Natal Municipal Bill; (2) the Natal Licensing Act; (3) the hardships of [Indians in the] Transvaal; and (4) the forthcoming Colonial Conference.
 The Colonial Conference is scheduled to meet on April 15, and the Committee will have to busy itself about it with all its energy. As for the other three problems, we have to send them the necessary information. Regarding the two Natal Acts, we feel that we should hold a [protest] meeting and send cables to Lord Elgin and  also inform the Committee. It must be borne in mind that such an opportunity, once lost, will never come again.

 "
253,,TONGAAT LICENCE,"
    
 The appeal against the rejection of the  Tongaat  licence  was heard on January 31. A special report of this is given in our English section. It will be seen that, by and large, the Licensing Board has done no injustice. Those whose houses or shops have been certified fit by the doctors are given licences; and orders have been passed that licences be given to persons whose account books are fairly well kept. The result of this appeal provides full confirmation of the warning we had issued.
 If we keep our shops and houses clean and maintain our accounts in an irreproachable manner, there will be no fear of our losing the licences. Nobody should be able to point the finger at us. It is not enough that our houses are ordinarily well kept; they should be so clean that no other houses can compare with them. We believe that Dr. Hill gave favourable evidence out of compassion. But we must not depend upon such pity. Nobody should assume that, because we are saved this year, we shall be saved next year also. Our houses, our shops and our books ought to be in proper condition, ready for inspection at any time. If they are, there will be little likelihood of difficulty in obtaining licences.
 We earnestly hope that all Indian businessmen will take to heart the lesson learnt in the Tongaat licence case.

 "
254,,INDIAN TRADERS IN NATAL,"
    
 We have written a great deal of the fresh troubles that have come upon the Indian traders in Natal.libtech_339_footnoteYet we cannot think too much about what we are to do in that matter.
 Writing in The Times of Natal, one Mr. F. A. Baker says that he once saw a Kaffir painting the front of an Indian shop and goes on to make the following comments:
 I do not know whether the common man notices this sort of thing. If he did, he would never argue that Indian traders should not be driven out forcibly. However much we [Whites] patronize Indian traders, they will never patronize a White. They never drop a coin into the pocket of a White, unless forced to do so. I have seen [White] Government servants, workers and others, entering Indian shops. But have these traders ever given them any work? Even when an Indian trader knows of a starving White, he never helps him. Why should we show pity to such Indians? If our members of parliament do not pass an Act to drive out these Indians, we must replace them by others who will carry out our wishes.
 From these views expressed by a White we have a lesson to learn: We must encourage the Whites too. It is a short-sighted policy to employ, through sheer niggardliness, a Kaffir for washing work. If we keep in view the conditions in this country and patronize the Whites, whenever proper and necessary, then every such White will serve as an advertisement for the Indian trader. We do certain things to flatter or please the White merchants; if, instead of doing so, or over and above that, we helped a White, not in order to humour him but for doing him a good turn, that will yield us better results. We believe that to help a needy White is much better in every way than to feed a serpent like Mr. Tatham with milk and be bitten later. It is in the belief that they
 
 will harm us that we have not hitherto helped poor whites. Even if they do us harm, we shall have no occasion for regret, for we did not help them in the hope of a good turn in exchange.

255,,MIDDELBURG LOCATION,"
    
 
 The Middelburg Town Council has served a notice on  the Indians in the Location in that town to vacate it within three months. Those who have built houses have been asked to shift them from the site ! This would mean that Indians who have lived there for a long time would have to remove the structures and leave without compensation. The Indians in the Location have addressed the British Indian Association on the subject, and an enquiry is being made.

256,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 FOR INDIANS GOING TO DELAGOA BAY
 I wrote last week about Indians going to Delagoa Bay.libtech_340_footnoteMr. Manga who has arrived here from Delagoa Bay met the Portuguese Consul. The Consul has agreed to permit Indians who make an affidavit before him to proceed to Delagoa Bay. To a communication addressed to him, he has sent the following reply:
 With reference to your letter dated the 22nd, I have to state that there are no restrictions on foreigners visiting Delagoa Bay. But those intending to stay in Delagoa Bay have to obtain a permit to do so. If they propose to stay for less than twenty days, they have to intimate to the municipality their addresses and the purpose of the visit. A statement to this effect may be made before me also. Those who do not make such a statement are liable to be penalised; but three days’ grace is usually given for the observance of these regulations.
 
 In view of this, Indians who desire to go to India through Delagoa Bay will meet with no difficulty, if they obtain the requisite permit from the Consul.
 ELECTION CAMPAIGN
 The election campaign is on. The rival candidates are spending a lot of money to get themselves elected. They have written letters to the electors asking for their votes. Sir Richard Solomon is going all out in his efforts at Pretoria. The result will be known by the 22nd of this month. The Star has called him the “National Scout”.
 DR. PORTER
 In his recent report to the Johannesburg  Town  Councillibtech_341_footnoteon health and sanitation in the city, Dr. Porter has criticized the Indians as follows.
 SMALLPOX
Writing about smallpox, Dr. Porter says:
 The greatest obstruction is caused by Asiatics and Somalis. The Asiatics resist anyone entering their houses [for purposes of inspection or treatment]. They obstruct the isolation of patients and measures to prevent infection. Whenever a medical examination is attempted, they send the patients into the toilet. It was only after a leading person was fined for an attempt to hide a case of suspected smallpox that they came to their senses. Later such cases came to the knowledge of the authorities without much difficulty, thanks to Mr. Lloyd. A great deal of help was forthcoming from the leaders of the Indian community at the time of the plague.libtech_342_footnote
 MALAY LOCATION
 There was a population of 4,200 in November 1905 in the Malay Location. Of this number 1,600 were Indians,  970 Malays, 70 Chinese and Japanese, 100 Somalis, etc., 40 Kaffirs, 1,300 Cape Boys and 120 Whites. Reporting on the Location in January 1906, Dr. Stock pointed out that, as there was a possibility of well-water being contaminated through percolation, it was necessary to drain the slop-water [on the surface]. There was danger of smallpox and plague breaking
 
 out among the Indians because they concealed their patients. The Chief Medical Officer suggested at first that it would be better if all poor Indians, waiters and the like, were removed from the town to the distant Bazaars. There were no doubt difficulties in doing this, but as the Klipspruit Location had  come up, arrangements could be made for Indians to go there. As many Indians did business with the Kaffirs, it was hoped that they would go to Klipspruit.
 This, in substance, is Dr. Porter’s report. It contains other important observations besides. But this summary requiresto be pondered over by every Indian. The suggestion about shifting to the Location is still here. And as long as we continue to conceal our patients and neglect the common rules of sanitation through niggardliness or laziness, the hreat of [removal to] the Locations will always remain.
 ASIATIC EATING-HOUSES
 The regulations governing Asiatic eating-houses, framed by the Johannesburg Town Council will come up before the Council in a few days. According to them the annual licensing fee will be £10. These regulations are meant primarily for the Chinese, but Indians too are covered by them. They will have to bear a great loss because the number of people using Indian eating-houses is very small, and they cannot therefore afford to pay the annual fee of £10. The British Indian Association has therefore written to the Council on the matter.libtech_343_footnoteOther provisions deal with keeping the premises clean and the procedure for obtaining licences.
 TURKEY AND GERMANY
 A cable appearing in The Rand Daily Mail shows that a fresh cause of conflict has arisen between Turkey and Germany. As it is not a Reuter cable and may not appear in the newspapers there, I give a translation below:
 It appears that a few days ago Fehim Pasha, the chief of the secret police, detained a German ship carrying  a  cargo  of timber. The reason for this was that its German owners did not offer bribes to the subordinate officers. The German Ambassador was informed of the Pasha’s action and he sent a protest to the Port [authorities].He further declared that, if the
 
 Pasha did not forthwith hand back the ship, it will be recovered with the help of the German Army for the rights of the German people were inviolable. This warning had the desired effect and the chief of the secret police immediately informed the German company that the ship had been released. Now the Ambassador has written a letter to the Port saying that Fehim Pasha is corrupt, is a free-booter and a notorious thief. Besides casting a slur on the good name of His Majesty the Sultan, he has belittled the Ottoman Government in the eyes of foreigners. The Ambassador further demands that Fehim Pasha should be deprived of his position according to law and  should  be deported or imprisoned for life.

 "
257,,THE DEFEAT OF “THE ADVERTISER”'libtech_344_footnote,"
    
 The meeting of Indian leaders with the editor of The Natal Advertiser has yielded good results. The Natal Advertiser has written at length pointing out the fancied contradictions between our writings, the work done by Messrs Gandhi and Ally and the facts as stated by the leaders of the Indian community. It has further pointed out that even men like Sir Lepel Griffin are prepared to grant all rights to Indians and to allow any number of them to emigrate to South Africa. It is obvious that all this writing is of no value whatever. But instead of acknowledging its defeat, The Advertiser has tried to keep up the facade. Leaving aside The Advertiser article under review, it is easy to see that the paper holds the view that big traders should have no difficulties, that problems arising from the Immigration Act should be solved and a just attitude adopted towards the Indian community. If The Advertiser continues this policy, both the newspapers of Durban will, it may reasonably be expected, be somewhat friendly to the Indian community and not attack it outright. Much good can result if  a similar arrangement can be arrived at with the Maritzburg papers also.
 
 
 However, we must not assume that nothing remains to be done after what has appeared in The Advertiser. Admittedly, we shall have less to contend with if the newspapers do not write against us. But we have many other enemies like the Press to win over. The whites are not the ones to give up the struggle. For instance, Mr. Arthur Wade has started inciting the Kaffirs; he has appealed to them not to have any dealings with Indian traders. It is true that one or two speeches of this kind will not have much effect. But this speech should be a warning to us to be on the alert.

 "
258,,NATAL LICENSING LAW,"
    
 During the hearing of an appeal about a licence before the Maritzburg Town Council, a member of the Council said that they ought to hesitate before refusing a licence to an Indian who is a  British subject. Moreover, the local chamber [of  commerce]  has  passed a resolution to the effect that an Indian should  have  no difficulty in obtaining a licence if he could prove that he was a British subject. In the four licence cases that were tried in  Verulam  the  charges were that the shops were dirty, that access to the houses was only through the shops or that the shops were also used as dining- rooms. In Potchefstroom, licences were refused on the score of colour alone. All the appeals from Ladysmith and the neighbouring places have been dismissed on the ground that the traders do not know how to keep accounts, that they do not know English at all and that they depend wholly on low-paid employees in these matters. The court refused even to record the evidence of the book-keepers. All this goes to show conclusively that the whi tes are ben t  on  dri ving  us  out  of thi s cou ntry.

259,,CAPE LICENCES ACT,"
    
 
 In this issue we publish a letterlibtech_345_footnoteconcerning licences from Grahams-town in the Cape Colony. This leads one to suspect that a large number of poor hawkers is unable to carry on business for want of licences. Such licences are a source of income to many Indians. We have read the Cape Act and, as far as we know, the Town Councils are bound to issue licences. Legal action therefore can be taken in this matter.
 The same difficulties are met with in Natal. The Act itself is very rigorous, but because of the strenuous efforts of Congress officials much harm has been, and will be, prevented. The Congress Secretaries go about from place to place, encouraging the people to take the necessary measures.
 The Cape League and the [British Indian] Association should follow this example. It is the duty of these two bodies to enquire into the conditions prevailing in every town. If they make sufficient effort, we believe, redress can be had. It must also be remembered that Natal does not offer the advantages that the Cape does for putting up a fight. It will, therefore, be a matter of shame if the Indian leaders in the Cape do not offer resistance. We are prepared to publish the names and addresses of all those who have not been able to obtain licences in the Cape, and we request all our readers to send us the same.

  "
260,,ETHICAL RELIGION–VII,"
    
 CHAPTER VII: SOCIAL IDEAL
 t is sometimes said that all morality involves social relations. This is well said; for instance, if the judge has a proper sense of justice, men who go to court obtain satisfaction. Similarly love, kindness, generosity and other qualities can be manifested only in relation to others. The force of loyalty can be demonstrated only in our relations with one another. Of patriotism, nothing need be said. Truly speaking, there is no aspect of morality the benefit of which accrues to the practitioner alone. Sometimes it is said that truthfulness and other virtues have nothing to do with the other person and are entirely personal. But we must admit that by telling the truth we prevent harm to another, just as by telling a lie and deceiving a person we do him an injury.
 In the same way, when a man disapproves of certain laws or customs and withdraws from society, even then his acts affect society. Such a man lives in a world of ideals. He does not worry that the world of his ideals is not yet born. For him the mere thought that the prevailing standard is not good enough is sufficient to impel him to resist it. He will constantly try to change other people’s way of life to his own. This is how prophets have caused the world’s wheels to change their course.
 So long as man remains selfish and does not care for the hap- piness of others, he is no better than an animal and perhaps worse. His superiority to the animal is seen only when we find him caring for his family. He is still more human, that is, much higher than the animal, when he extends his concept of the family to include his country or community as well. He climbs still higher in the scale when he comes to regard the human race as his family. A man is an animal or  imperfect [as a human being] to the extent that he falls behind in his service to humanity. If I feel my wife’s injury or that of my community, yet have no sympathy for anyone outside the circle, it is clear that I do not have any feeling for humanity as such; but I have, simply out of selfishness or a sense of discrimination, a certain feeling for my wife, my children or the community which I hold as my own.
 That is to say, we have neither practised nor known ethical religion so long as we do not feel sympathy for every human being. Now we know that the higher morality must be comprehensive; it must embrace all men. Considering our relation to mankind, every man has a claim over us, as it is our duty always to serve him. We should act on
 the assumption that we have no claim on others. He is merely ignorant who would here argue that the man acting in this manner will be trampled in the world’s scramble. For it is a universal experience that God always saves the man who whole-heartedly devotes himself to the service of others.
 According to this moral standard all men are equal. This is not to be interpreted to mean equality of position and function for all. It only means that, if I hold a high place, I also have the ability to shoulder its duties and responsibilities. I should not therefore lose my head and believe that men with smaller responsibilities are my inferiors. Equality depends on the state of our mind, and until our mind reaches that state, we shall remain backward.
 According to this moral standard no nation can rule another for selfish ends. It is immoral of the American people to reduce the aborigines to an inferior status and run the government. A civilized race coming into contact with a savage one owes it to the latter to raise it to its own level. The same standard rules that the king is the servant and not the master of his people and that the officers are not there to enjoy power but to make the people happy. If the people in a democratic state are selfish, that state comes to no good.
 Moreover, according to this law, the stronger members of a state or community have to protect, not oppress, the weaker ones. Under such a government there can be no starvation; nor can there be excessive accumulation of riches; for we can never be happy while we see our neighbours languishing in misery. The man following this high moral standard will never amass wealth. He who would be moral need not be scared away by the thought that few follow this ideal morality; for he is master of his morality, not of its results. He will be considered guilty if he does not practise morality; but nobody will find fault with him if his immoral behaviour has no consequences for society.

261,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 NEW PARLIAMENT
 There has been a great deal of hustle over the new parliament of the Transvaal, which is to have 58 members, 38 of whom will represent the Johannesburg area. The nominations of candidates were filed on Saturday, the 9th. This issue of Indian Opinion will be in the hands of readers by the 16th or the 18th. The election will take place on
 Wednesday, the 20th. The names of successful candidates will be known on the 21st. It is therefore hoped that these names will be available to our readers in the next issue.
 THE PARTIES
 In all there are five parties: Progressive (i.e. mine-owners), Hetvolk, (i.e., the Dutch), Nationalist, Independent, and Labour. Only two of these are parties in the real sense. The Nationalist Party, it may be said, has been formed for those who might be scared by the names, Progressive and Hetvolk. It is widely believed that the Hetvolk and Nationalist Parties will fare well and that, between them, they will secure a majority of the seats. Many look upon the Progressive Party with disfavour. The leaders of the Hetvolks are General Botha and General Smuts, those of the Nationalists Sir Richard Solomon and Mr. Wyburg and of the Progressives Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, Sir  George Farrar, Mr. Hosken, etc. and others.
 The real tussle that is going on is between Sir Richard Solomon and Sir Percy Fitzpatrick. They are both candidates from Pretoria. It is difficult to say which of the two will win. Sir Richard’s views about the Chinese and theKaffirs havingundergone a change, he is being looked upon by many with scorn. He was ready to bring the Chinese into the Colony, but now says that his views in the matter have changed. Formerly, he used to say that the Kaffirs should get their legitimate rights; now he would approve whatever the other members propose to do about them.
 An analysis shows that there are 35 Hetvolk, 29 Progressive, 32 Independent, 15 Nationalist and 12 Labour candidates. Five of the Hetvolk candidates have already been elected unopposed.
 The Indian community, it appears, stands neither to lose nor to gain whichever party comes to power, for members of both the parties have already expressed themselves against the Indians.

 An article has been published in The Transvaal Advertiser which clearly appears to have been inspired by the Permit Office. It says that the Indian community causes the Permit Office much trouble, that the failure of the Ordinance to receive assent has increased the work of that office, that Indians enter without permits from hundreds of places, that they bring in their children without permits and employ them in the stores, and that the decisions of the Supreme Court have moreover created numerous obstacles in the working of the existing law. The Advertiser has thus tried to incite the people so as to ensure in advance that the new parliament passes the Ordinance again.
 The statements are obviously false. Instead of the Permit Office being put to trouble, it is that office which  gives  trouble.  The hardships caused by the law are increasing instead of decreasing; and the Supreme Court steps in only when the Permit Office transgresses all limits. It is not enough that we know all this. Knowing this, we ought to adopt remedies for these ills. The measures that need to be taken have already been indicated in Indian Opinion. But the greatest, the ultimate, remedy is going to gaol; and so long as that is not forg- otten, no harm can befall [us]. The adoption of this remedy will also require a good deal of money. The British Indian Association and all other bodies should take quick and effective measures in this regard.
 MIDDELBURG LOCATION
 News has now been received from Middelburg about the Location there. Acting on it, the Association has written to the Town Clerk asking him why the notices have been issued. Further action in the matter will be taken after a reply has been received.
 COOVADIA’S CASE
 Mr. Coovadia, a well-known merchant of Johannesburg, who is the Treasurer of the British Indian Association, was on his way to Johannesburg with his 16-year-old son. The boy was forced to detrain at Volksrust because he did not have a permit. Earlier when a permit was applied for, it was refused, and Captain Fowle had given the assurance that there would be no difficulty at all. Though  Mr. Coovadia had this letter with him, the boy was nevertheless asked to detrain.Medical evidence indicated that the boy was eighteen years old, whereupon the Magistrate refused to release him. A written representation was made to Mr. Chamney who declined to intervene. Last Monday, the case came up for hearing at Volksrust, when the Magistrate refused to send it up to Johannes burg for recording evidence. It will now therefore be heard next Monday. In the end, of course, the boy will be let off. But think of the trouble and expense Mr. Coovadia will have to go through before obtaining justice in such  a trifling matter! When a permit was applied for, it was said that it could not be issuedas the boy was under sixteen.libtech_346_footnoteAnd for want of a permit one has to undergo all this expense. When a well-known man has to suffer these hardships, what about the poor?
 
 
 
 REGULATIONS FOR ASIATIC EATING-HOUSES
 The British Indian Association has sent a representationlibtech_347_footnoteagainst these Regulations to the Town Council. It states that the licence fee for an eating-house should not be as high as £10 and that there was no need for applying these stringent rules to the Indian community as it was small in number.
 DR. HEGGER
 Dr. Hegger has come here in connection with the election campaign. In a speech he made on Sunday he said that an Indian voter had offered him a large sum, which he had refused. Obviously this is quite untrue. We may hope to hear more of the matter. Mr. Macintyre, who heard this falsehood, has sent a report in English for Indian Opinion.
 RAINS
 This time there has been abundant rainfall in Johannesburg as indeed in the whole of the Transvaal. For three days it has  been raining continuously. Great damage has been caused at Standerton by the heavy rain. The tank in Boksburg is overflowing.

263,,"WHEN WOMEN ARE MANLY, WILL MEN BE EFFEMINATE?","
    
 This question is suggested by some cablegrams received from England last week. While English women do manly deeds, shall we, though men, behave like women? This is no matter for fun, but a grave one indeed. Let us see how.
 The women of England have no franchise. They are fighting for it without minding people’s ridicule. A few days ago a procession of eight hundred women marched to the Houses of Parliament. then the police stopped the crowd, some brave women tried to force their way into the House. These women do not belong to the working class. One of them is a sister of General Frenchlibtech_350_footnote, and over Sixty years old. Another, Miss Pankhurst, is the daughter of a well-known wealthy Englishman. Both are women of learning. There were many such women in this crowd of eight hundred. Of those who forced their way in, prominent ladies like General French’s sister were arrested andprosecuted. The Magistrate sentenced them to fines ranging from
 £1 to £2, or to imprisonment for varying periods. Such sentences have been passed on 49 women, and each one of them, instead of paying up the pittance of a fine, has courted imprisonment. The aged sister of General French is also among them. We believe these women have behaved in a manly way.
 Now let us look at our own house. Lord Selborne and Sir  Richard  Solomon  say   that   the   Asiatic  Ordinance  should   be   [re-
 ]enacted. Perhaps that will be done in a month or two. Will Indians go to gaol if that happens? We think men cry for fear of imprisonment when they are caught while using a false permit, but not while committing the offence. This we regard as unmanly. Now  when  people are wrongfully treated as criminals and asked to give their finger-prints, will they quietly give them or will they go to gaol? If they give their finger-prints and suffer dishonour, we  shall  regard them as doubly unmanly. Hence we ask: will Indian men be effeminate? Or will they emulate the manliness shown by English women and. wake up? Will they choose to find happiness in prison taking it to be a palace, or will they submit to oppression when the Transvaal Government starts it? In a few days our mettle will be tested.

264,,LADYSMITH LICENCES,"
    
 To return to the subject of the Ladysmith licences, we should examine how much of the blame lies with us. We have repeatedly written on this matter in our English columns. A question has been asked in the House of Commons on the subject at the instance of the [South Africa British Indian] Committee, but it would be better if we made a search nearer home.
 It came out in the course of the judgement on the appeal that the account books had been written up newly or only occasionally and were got written by a man for an annual fee of £8. The Natal Witness has severely criticized these practices and approved the action of the Ladysmith Board. We must think over all this. It is essential to maintain regular accounts. It is unnecessary for every  trader  to employ a separate accountant; what is necessary is that the accounts must be written up regularly so that no one can say a word against them. It is also possible to have the accounts written by an English accountant or through a lawyer, where a competent Indian accountant is not available. We shall never succeed unless we give up some of our stingy ways.

265,,CAPE IMMIGRATION ACT,"
    
 Cables have appeared in the Press saying that the [Imperial] Government have assented to the new Cape Immigration Act and that it will soon come into force. The main difference is that, while formerly all Indians anywhere in South Africa were allowed to enter the Cape, now only the old Indian residents will be allowed in. There are other changes besides. We believe that the remissness of the Cape Indian leaders is partly responsible for these changes. It was quite likely that, even if there had been a strenuous struggle, the Indians would have lost the case, but then we would at least have done our duty. Again, for a struggle, the Cape offers advantages not found elsewhere. But the Cape Indians do not avail themselves of these advantages.

266,,TRADING LAW IN NATAL,"
    
 We have reliable information that the resolution of the Licensing Board of Ladysmith has alarmed many members of the Durban Chamber of Commerce. In a private meeting of members, many expressed the opinion that the Licensing Act should be repealed. In the end they appointed Messrs Handuz and Butcher to inquire into the matter. Here is an opportunity which we can use to great advantage, if only our leaders will meet prominent members of the Chamber, and particularly the two gentlemen above named, and come to some agreement. What should be done is indicated in an English article in the present issue. We shall publish a Gujarati translation of it in the next issue. Changes in the Act have been suggested from a disinterested point of view, and nobody is bound to agree with them. However, there is no doubt that this is the only course for us to adopt.

267,,NATAL MUNICIPAL BILLlibtech_351_footnote,"
    
 We should be grateful to Lord Elgin for moving in the matter of the Natal Municipal Bill. He says that the term “uncivilized” should not be defined so as to include sons of indentured labourers. Moreover he says that it is not legitimate to include Indians among “Coloured persons”, for all sorts of people are covered by the term. The Indian Government feels strongly in the matter and insists that the Indian community should be granted relief. Lord Elgin therefore hopes that the Natal Government will consider the point. In this controversy, it is probable that we shall win, if we do our duty. The Natal Municipal Council has replied that the Bill should remain unchanged.

 FIVE  PERMIT CASES
 The case of Mr. Coovadia’s son was heard by the Magistrate of Volksrust on Friday the 15th.libtech_352_footnoteMr. Gandhi appeared  for  Mr. Coovadia. Giving Evidence, Constable MacGregor stated that boys under fourteen were allowed to enter without a permit, that permits were demanded of boys of fourteen and over, and that if they failed to produce them, they were arrested.
 Mr. James Codie deposed that one could not say that Captain Fowle’s decisions were always acceptable to the present Registrar. On being shown Captain Fowle’s letter about Mr. Coovadia’s  son,  he stated that the letter could not be treated as a permit and Mr. Chamney would not consider it as binding. On being severely cross-examined, he admitted that Mr. Chamney should accept every thing that had been done by Captain Fowle as Permit Officer. Mr. Amod Saleji Coovadialibtech_353_footnotegiving evidence about his nephew’s age said that he was a student at Johannesburg in 1903. Mr. Coovadia corroborated this testimony. Dr. Hick gave evidence about the boy’s age, and  Mrs Gandhi produced Captain Fowle’s letters that were with him. The boy himself gave evidence to show that he had some  knowledge  of English. Here the hearing [of the evidence] was over. The Magistrate then heard the arguments on both sides and acquitted the boy.
 After this the cases of four Indians were heard. They  were alleged to have entered with other people’s permits. Their names were Kika Parsad, Naga Bhana, Ambu Vallabh Soni and Mirzakhan. Three of them admitted that they had bought permits from others in Bombay on payment of Rs. 90 for each. The fourth man pleaded not guilty. All the four were sentenced to a fine of £40 or four month’s imprisonment.
 Mr. Coovadia’s case shows that persons with genuine case sometimes obtain justice, after spending a lot of money. This is so mainly because of the false cases that are taken to the courts. It can be
 
 seen from the four cases heard on the same day that those who sell permits only get people into trouble by practising deceit and fraud. Those buying such permits lose their livelihood, are needlessly ruined and cannot live in the Transvaal. By such deeds they do harm to the whole community and are responsible for the enactment of rigorous laws.
 ASIATIC BLUE BOOK
 Lord Elgin has published in England the complete history of the Asiatic Ordinance. Long cables about it have been received by all the three newspapers here. Among these, Lord Selborne’s statement, in particular, deserves to be noted by the Indian community. He severely criticizes Lord Elgin’s decision. He says that, in granting the Indian plea, Lord Elgin has broken [Lord Selborne’s] promise which he had made at Potchefstroom about not allowing fresh Indian immigrants till responsible government had been set up. This complaint of His Excellency is unjustified. For, the immigration of new Indians apart, even old residents have difficulty in re-entering the Colony and, if they succeed at all, it is after many months. He says further that many Indians continue to enter without permits. Even this statement should be regarded as improper, as the Indian community has repeatedly suggested to Lord Selborne the appointment of an inquiry commission to substantiate this. Lord  Seiborne’s  bitter remarks only show one thing: the Indian community has to put up a fight not merely against the Whites, but also against the Governor himself who, instead of remaining impartial, has turned against the Indians.
 NEW MEMBERS OF LEGISLATURE
 Lord Selborne has nominated 15 members to the legislature, of whom 11 are Progressives and four belong to the Hetvolk. They are: Mr. H. Crawford, Mr. L. Curtis, Col W. Daerymple, Mr. G. J. W.

269,,ETHICAL RELIGION–VIII,"
    
 
CHAPTER VIII: PERSONAL MORALITY
 
 ‘I am responsible for this,’ or ‘This is my duty’: this is a moving and wonderful thought. A mysterious, resounding  voice  seems to say, ‘To thee, individually, O man, is given this task. Whether defeat or victory, both belong to thee. Thou art what no one else in the world is, for nowhere has nature created two similar objects. Thou hast a duty which no one else in the world can do, and if thou dost not do it that loss will stand debited to thee in the world’s balance-sheet.’
‘What is that duty I owe to myself?’ Someone may quote the
 verse:     Call 	not man God, for man is not God,  Yet 	man is not distinct from God’s glory,   And 	answer, ‘My duty is to rest secure in the belief that I am a 
  	ray of God’s light.’ Another may answer that the duty is to have 	sympathy and fraternal regard for others. A third may answer that it 	is to revere parents, care for one’s wife and children, and acquit 	oneself well with brother, sister or friend. Alongside of all these 	virtues, it is also a part of my duty to respect myself even as I 	respect others. As long as I do not understand myself, how shall I 	understand others? And how shall I respect one whom I do not know? 	Many hold the view that the obligation of proper conduct arises 	[only] in relation to others and that, in the absence of contact 	with others, one may do just as one pleases. He who holds this view 	does not know what he says. In this world none can, with impunity, 	act as he pleases.  	Let us now see what our duty is to ourselves. Let us take, first, 	our private habits which are unknown to all but ourselves. We are 	responsible for them since they affect our character; but this is 	not all. We are responsible for them also because they affect 	others. Every person ought to control his own impulses, and keep his 	soul as well as body clean. ‘Tell me,’ says a great man, ‘what 	a man’s private habits are and I shall tell you what he is or will 	be’. We should therefore control all our appetites, so that we do 	not drink or eat to excess. Else we shall lose our strength and our 	good name. Worldly success never comes to him who does not abstain 	from sensual pleasures and does 
 not thus save his body, mind, intellect and soul.
 Arguing along these lines and keeping one’s instincts pure, one should further consider how to put them to use. One ought to have a fixed aim in life. If we do not discover our life’s purpose, and keep steadily to the course, we shall be swept along like a rudderless ship on the high seas; we shall falter on the [moral] path. Man’s highest duty in life is to serve mankind and take his share in bettering its condition. This is true worship—true prayer. He is a godly man who does God’s work. Hypocrites and cheats going about invoking God’s name are legion. Because a parrot utters the name of God, no one would call it godly. Contribution to an ideal order of human life is something everyone can aim at. With this aim in view the mother may legitima- tely rear her child, the lawyer may pursue his profession, the merchant may carry-on his business or trade and the working man may labour. A person with that fixed aim would never deviate from the path of morality, for if he did, he could not fulfil his aim of uplifting mankind.
 Let us consider the matter in some detail. We ought constantly to examine whether our way of life tends to improve human life or to worsen it. Thus the merchant should ask himself whether,  in transacting a business, he is cheating himself or another. The lawyer and the physician, acting according to this standard, will give more thought to their client or patient than to their fees. The mother in rearing her child would proceed very cautiously lest she should spoil the child out of misguided love or some selfish interest. The worker too would be guided by these considerations and do his duty. The result of all this would be that, if the worker fulfils his function in conformity with the moral ideal, he would be deemed better and  higher than the wealthy merchant, physician or lawyer who lives without any discipline. The worker would be the true coin and those selfish men, even though more intelligent or wealthy, would be counterfeit. This further shows that any man, whatever his place in life, has the power to fulfil this aim. A man’s value depends upon his way of life, not his status. One’s way of life is not to be judged by one’s visible outward actions, but by one’s inner leanings. For instance, if of two men, one gives a dollar to a poor person to rid himself of his presence and the other half a dollar but with love and out of compassion for the man, obviously, the one who gave half a dollar is
 truly moral, while the other who gave a dollar, the sinner.
 To sum up, he alone is religious, he alone is happy and he alone is wealthy, who is sincere in himself, bears no malice, exploits no one and always acts with a pure mind. Such men alone can serve mankind. How can a damp matchstick kindle a log of wood? How can a man who does rot practise morality teach it to another? How can a sinking man save another from drowning? The man who lives a moral life never raises the question as to how to serve the world, for he is never in doubt. Mathew Arnold says of a friend:
 I saw him sensitive in frame, I knew his spirits low,
 And wished him health, success, and fame— I do not wish it now.
 For these are all their own reward, And leave no good behind:
 They try us—oftenest make us hard, Less modest, pure, and kind.
 Time was when Arnold wished his friend health, success and fame. But he did not so wish now, because his friend’s happiness or misery did not depend on their presence or absence; he therefore only wished that his morality might ever endure. Emerson says, “Adversity is the prosperity of the great.” Both the money and the  fame belonging to the base are a misery to them and to the world.libtech_354_footnote

 NOTICE REGARDING PERMITS
 A notice published in the Government Gazette here says that permits, if applied for before March 31, will be issued to Indians who are at present in the Transvaal and can prove that they were there in 1899 and during or just before the war and that they left the Colony
 
 because of the war. After that date, those who do not hold a permit will be prosecuted. The notice means in effect that those who possess old registers and are at present in the Transvaal, or those who have other documents but not the yellow permit itself, should  get  one issued by March 31.
 VREDEDORP ORDINANCE
 A member of the South Africa British Indian Committee had tabled a question in the House of Commons about the Vrededorp Ordin-ance. Mr. Winston Churchill said in reply that correspondence was going on with Lord Selborne regarding the compensation to be paid to Indians. This shows that Mr. Ritch has been working for the Committee most energetically; and that its effect is being felt. On receipt of this cable, the British Indian Association held a meeting and resolved to have photographs taken of the Vrededorp Location and publish them in a supplement to Indian Opinion and to send a cable [to England]. In pursuance of this resolution, a long cablelibtech_355_footnotehas been sent to the Committee saying that Indians own £19,000 worth of property—land, goods, buildings and outstandings—in that Location and that as many as 75 Indians live in it.
 ASIATIC EATING-HOUSES
 A letter on this subject has been received from the Johannesburg Town Council saying that it will certainly not reduce the annual fee that had already been fixed. The Association has written again.
 RAILWAY HARDSHIPS
 Letters were addressed to the General Manager of  Railways about Mr. Coovadia not being allowed to go to Pretoria  by  the morning train and about Mr. James, an Indian, who was insulted by the conductor during his journey from Germiston. The reply states that an inquiry is being made.
 NEW ELECTION
 Last time I sent 48 names. The remaining 21 are given below: Parktown—Colonel Sampson (P); Newtown—R. Goldman (N); Trefontein—F. Bayers (HV); Barberton—R. K. Loveday ( ); Carolina—Ven Ardot (HV); Armello—Collins (HV); Roodekopen—
 
 Bezuideh Hout (HV); Leydenburg—C.T. Rabbi (HV), Mary Coel and Lomer (HV); Middelburg—Clarco (HV), De Wet (HV); Pretoria—J. Rissick (HV), De Erasmus (HV); Standerton—General Botha (HV); Bethal—Grovler (HV); Volksrust—J. A. Jubers (HV); Watterburg—F. Bayers (HV), De Wall (HV); Bloembauff—I. Farrera (HV); Zoutpansburg-—Manik (HV) and A. Mantus (HV). Thus of a total of 69 elected, 21 are Progressive, 35 Hetvolk, seven Nationalist, three Labour Party and three Independent.
 The election campaign has ended with results that nobody had foreseen. The Dutch have won a victory leaving all the other parties well behind. The most that was hoped for was that the Dutch and the Nationalist Party together might win a majority. This means that in political affairs the Dutch have won back what they lost in the war. There is great excitement over Sir Richard Solomon’s defeat at Pretoria. Sir Richard will not now be able to assume the office of Prime Minister. But it is being said that some elected member will resign his seat and Sir Richard will thus be given an opportunity to enter parliament. If this comes about, it seems probable that  Sir Richard will become Minister for Justice. General Botha is likely to be the Prime Minister. That is to say, he will be as good as President. This has greatly elated the hearts of the Dutch. For us there is not much in this either to rejoice or to regret. However, one may hope that the Dutch will do the Indian community some measure of justice. Some of them know the Indian community well. It does not seem likely that they will be wholly unjust. I am writing this on Tuesday, the 26th. However, it would be no matter for surprise if the cabinet were to be formed before this issue of Indian Opinion is out.

 MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,
 I am sending in a separate packet the Hamidia Society’s job. The book is to be the same size as a printed copy of a report I am
 sending you in the same packet. In addition to the Gujarati rules and their English translation both of which have already bee sent, you have to print the enclosed Gujarati matter. The Gujarati matter now enclosed is also to be rendered in English and printed. Will you please let me know the charge for printing 500 copies of the whole job? You need not count the cost of translation and let me know also approxi- mately how many pages the whole thing will occupy. This will be in your hands on Thursday. If you can send me a telegram for 1s, you may let me know the charge by telegram, as I am likely to be there next week and I am anxious while I am here to get either the order or its withdrawal. I raised the question of cost myself, because it seemed to me that the job was rather bulky, and, if a bill was rendered to them, that might appear to them to be too big, [and] they might feel dissatisfied. I thought, therefore, that they should know the true  position beforehand. I have got the Gujarati proof for the rules which  I am sending in the same packet. You need not proceed with the printing because everything will depend upon the acceptance of our terms. You should keep the Gujarati matter at present with you, for, in the event of the acceptance of our terms, I shall be able to translate it there on my coming.
 I am sending something more for Indian Opinion. You have sent me the proof of Messrs Avery’s order. I return it. I wonder if you oticed the glaring blunders in the English portion. I had to telegraph you.
       [PS]     [Enclosure]  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI 
  	As regards the article by “The Colonist” which I had asked you 	to translate, we might add in the Gujarati translation that the 	ideas expressed in the article are ‘ours’.  	It is not necessary to rule the paper for me. The moneys for the 	Madressa that were posted elsewhere are now properly credited. These 	and the ones recently received are included in  the  settlement. 	Lalbhai’s was received only yesterday. Kalyandas has not sent the 	customs note.

272,,GOGA’S LICENCE,"
    
 This licence appeal case should give us much food for thought. Mr. Goga deserves congratulations on his success. The Indian community, too, should be pleased. In this matter, The Natal Mercury has commented strongly in our favour. So too has The Times of Natal. The local Government also is helping us. But what is the good of all this? How much did Mr. Goga have to spend to get his right accepted? He had to engage three lawyers, all reputed to be at the top of the profession in Natal.libtech_356_footnoteHe had a very anxious time before he got his licence. And then, it was not out of a sense of justice that the Town Council gave it to him; but under pressure. For, as soon as the case of Mr. Goga’s licence concluded, there came up the case of a poor Indian, Benne by name. In his case, too, the objection related to the books of account, but the licence was refused. The reason was that Benne could not engage three lawyers and take the matter further. And so he is to have no licence. It only means that those who are very rich can save their licences.libtech_357_footnoteBut how long can the well-to-do hold out while the poor are ruined? The ate he rich Indians depends upon that of the poor Indian shopkeepers. The subject is being discussed throughout the Colony at present. The Chamber of Commerce intends to work on our side, so that if we put up a good fight, we shall probably succeed in getting the law changed.
 With this object in view we, as independent observers, have made some suggestions in the English section. It is necessary for us to organize resistance throughout the Colony along those lines. The Congress is working hard. It should exert itself further, establish contacts with the Chambers and approach other Europeans and important members of parliament in order to bring about a solution.

273,,CAPE IMMIGRATION ACT,"
    
 
 A new Immigration Act has been passed in the Cape, which, in our opinion, is much worse than the one in Natal. For the present, we reproduce here only its worst features. If an Indian not knowing English leaves the Cape without a permit, he cannot return even if he has been a resident. That means that an Indian who does not know English will have to take out a permit each time he goes out and pay a fee of £1. Such a permit will be issued for a limited period only. One cannot therefore have a permanent certificate. Moreover, according to the Gezette in which the Act is published, a person applying for such a certificate will have to produce his photograph and other tokens of identity. The clause requiring a permit is not relaxable because it is a part of the Act, and the Act has already received the assent of Lord Elgin. The matter of the photograph, however, falls within the discretion of the Governor. It is a local regulation, which can be amended from time to time. We would advise the leaders of the Cape to fight out the question of the photograph without losing time. It was  a mistake that they allowed the Act to be passed in the first place. But we will regard it as a major crime if the clause requiring a photograph remains. If this practice is established in the Cape, it will have repercussions elsewhere, and offend religious sentiment. We hope the leaders of the Cape will lose no time in taking up this matter. We print elsewhere a translation of the main portions of the Act.

274,,“THE MERCURY” AND INDIAN TRADERS,"
    
 The comments appearing in The Natal Mercury of February 21 on Indian traders deserve to be known and understood. The paper upholds the Indian traders and condemns the Ladysmith Council. But it also shows the kind of rocks the ship of our trade has to steer clear of. The Mercury says that Maritzburg merchants should consider it their good fortune that they have at all been granted licences. Despite notices served on them, they had not kept proper account books. It was only when another notice was served that they did so. The Council was not bound to give notice twice, and without caring for the
 
 members of the Labour Party, the Council issued licences out of kindness. We should remember that such kindness is not likely to be repeated. The Whites have already risen in opposition to the issuing of licences in this manner. However, the danger has passed for this year. But if it happens repeatedly, the holder of the licence will lose it and the Congress will not be able to help such a negligent person. Every Indian trader should bear this in mind and devote full attention to the proper maintenance of books and to the cleanliness of his shop and his house.

 his Committee has been doing excellent work as the two recent cablegrams show. One of them mentions the steps taken by the Committee in regard to the Ladysmith matter, as a result of which Lord Elgin has sent a strong communication. The notice in which the decision not to issue licences after a year was published has had to be publicly withdrawn. The second cablegram tells us that, though the Vrededorp Ordinance has been passed, the [Imperial] Government is again corresponding with Lord Selborne regarding the compensation to be paid to Indian residents. From this and from Mr. Ritch’s letters which we publish every week, it is clear that much benefit is likely to accrue to us from the appointment of the South Africa Committee.

276,,VREDEDORP ORDINANCE,"
    
 We publish in this issue some photographs bearing on the Ordnance. They will show that what Mr. Churchill has described as shanties are not shanties at all but magnificent buildings. It was necessary to bring out this supplement [of photographs] because with these we could convince Lord Elgin that all the information sent to him from here should not be accepted as true. Especially when the information relates to the Indians, it is hardly ever likely to be true, because the European officials here are found to share the anti-Indian prejudices that the other Whites have. Lord Selborne may have no knowledge of the condition of Indian houses in Vrededorp, and we cannot therefore blame him. It is the officers below who do all the harm.
 In this issue we also publish a table which will show that the loss suffered by the Indian community in Vrededorp amounts to £19,000. The table will lend much support to the agitation being conducted in London that Indians should be compensated for this loss.

277,,NEW IMMIGRATION ACT IN THE CAPE,"
    
 
 The new Immigration Act was published in the Cape Government Gazette of February 15. The following is a translation of the clauses relating to Indians:
 PROHIBITED IMMIGRANTS
 A person coming under any of the clauses below will be considered a “prohibited immigrant” and will not be allowed to enter: (1) a person who is unable, owing to insufficient education, to write out and sign, in the characters of any European language, an application to the satisfaction of the [Immigration] Officer; (2) a person who has no means of livelihood; (3) a person convicted of

 (4) any Asiatic lawfully resident in the Colony and returning to it in accordance with the terms and conditions of a permit taken and authorizing him to be absent temporarily.
 EXAMINATION ON LANDING
 Every person landing at any port in the Colony shall be required to satisfy the Immigration Officer that he is not a prohibited immigrant and that he is exempted from the provisions of the Act. Under this regulation every one who lands in the Cape Colony, save a minor under sixteen and  a wife accompanying her husband, will have to fill in a printed form. Those who do not fill in this form or those who, notwithstanding their having filled it in, are found to be [prohibited] immigrants, shall be liable to detention.
 However, if a person wants to prove his right of landing, he will be given every reasonable facility to do so.
 TEMPORARY PERMITS
 Temporary permits will be issued to those who wish to enter in order to tranship or to reside temporarily in it for a reasonably necessary purpose on payment of a fee of £1 and of a reasonable sum to be deposited as security. The deposit shall bc refunded to the holder of the permit if he returns within the period for which the permit is issued. However, if a permit-holder overstays, he will forfeit his deposit and he may be arrested and prosecuted. Any permit-holder who gives a false or misleading address shall be liable to forfeit his permit and to prosecution. The Chief Immigration Officer will have the power to issue a permit for three weeks and the Minister concerned the power to issue one for three months.
 PHOTOGRAPHIC PERMITS
 Asiatics lawfully resident in the Colony can take out these permits. The period for which they are available and the port at which the holder shall disembark on return to the Colony will be stated in these permits. A fee of £1 will be charged for a permit; every permit shall contain a photograph of the holder and such particulars and marks as may be necessary for purposes of identification.

278,,HIS MAJESTY AMIR HABIBULLAH AT ALIGARH COLLEGE,"
    
 
 His Majesty the Amir visited Aligarh College on January 16, and he was welcomed with great honours. We give here a translation from The Times of India of his address to the students of that College on the occasion.
 SHIYA AND SUNNI
 You are young. Please listen to me. Some people may have told you that I am a fanatic Sunni. But does it mean that because I am a Sunni I am a fanatic? I shall ask you a question: Will those of you who are Shiyas show greater regard to Hindus than to Sunnis? Never. Will you then believe that I, who am a Sunni, will prefer Hindus to Shiyas? Never. You must have read in the newspapers that, on Bakr-Id,   I prevented the killing of cows in Delhi lest it should hurt the feelings of Hindus. If such is my regard for the Hindus, do you believe that I shall have less for the Shiyas? I beg of you to give up from today the notion that I am a fanatic Sunni. In Afghanistan my subjects include sunnis, Shiyas, Hindus and Jews. I allow them all full religious freedom. Do you call this fanaticism? But one thing I must say: I cannot allow Shiyas to show disrespect to the three Khalifas. If people think it fanatical of me to prevent Shiyas from  showing  such disrespect, well, I am a fanatic.
 EDUCATION
 Many people have spoken against the Aligarh College. I have therefore come to find out the truth for myself. I am thankful to the Government of India for letting Muslims assemble in such numbers to meet me and for giving me this opportunity to address you. When I questioned the students of Aligarh College today, I was glad to find them well informed on religious matters. I shall therefore be able to silence those who have been speaking against the College.
 WESTERN EDUCATION
 I would never say that you should not receive western education. On the contrary, I would advise you—and I would say this twice
 over—to exert yourselves to the utmost to receive that education. But before you do that you must have education in Islam. I have started the Habibia College in Afghanistan. There I have allowed western education to be imparted in order that the students may grow up to be whole Muslims. I found the students whom I examined today to be very well educated in religion.
 DONATION TO COLLEGE
 I am very sorry that, in view of the heavy expenditure I have to incur on education in my own country, I cannot help the Aligarh College as much as I should like to. For the present, I shall give the College Rs. 500 every month. It is my advice that those whom I examined today should be sent abroad for extensive travel. They will prove successful in the future. In addition to the Rs. 500 a month, I now donate Rs. 20,000 to the College.
 WELCOME AT GWALIOR
 After being honoured at Aligarh College His Majesty the Amir went to Gwalior where he was received with much pomp and ceremony. He was Maharaja Scindia’s guest and stayed in his palace.

[MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,]
 
 I have your two letters. I entirely agree with you. I am glad you have got thirteen pages this time. I am writing to Mr. West to persuade him. I anticipated your objection about the splitting up of letters in Gujarati words. I noticed the defect at Volksrust, where  I  was yesterday, and then and there wrote to Anandlal.libtech_363_footnoteI sent some Gujarati matter and a lot of English from Volksrust. I hope you received both.
 I enclose herewith an order for 1,000 handbills to be printed in Dutch and English. The paper may be any size not less than octavo. The English and Dutch should be as written on the enclosed. You should send 1,000 copies of this to Mr. A. E. M. Gachalia, Box 97, Volksrust. Please, also, put him down as a subscriber for Volksrust. You may already have the name for Pretoria also. I have agreed to charge £1 for 1,000 handbills. Of course, the railage will be extra. When the order is ready, you may send him your bill for £1 and subscription. 1 He has promised to send you an advertisement also within a week or so. If he does not send it, you may remind me.
 I fear you will have to make some alterations in the Hamidia rules. Mr. fancy properly drew my attention to the fact  that  the English rules were more numerous than the Gujarati. You will, therefore, see the changes made by me. I have struck off from 49 to 53 inclusive; 48 has been replaced by another to read the same as the Gujarati, so, also has No. 22. You will see it more fully in the body of the rules which I am sending. Mr. Fancy has made some necessary corrections in the Gujarati matter also, which, too, you should note. You need not then send any further proof, but simply proceed with the printing. I have not gone through the English word for word, but I take it that there are no mistakes of spelling, etc. The [word,] Press, in Gujarati is printed in inverted type. This, of course, should  be corrected. With reference to the closet arrangement for Harilal
 
 and Dhoribhai, I certainly think that we should dig the trench if we have been doing so for the barrack people. I do not think that we should ask the employees to dig their trenches, unless they would do so of their own accord. I felt exactly the same thing as you have. I then argued it out for myself and gave the decision. At the same time if the barrack people have been digging their own trenches, it simply means that you have to get the structure erected and leave Harilal and Dhoribhai to dig the trench. The thing is that, somehow or other, it has got to be done:
 I am writing to Mr. Lachiram. I have not heard from Tongaat regarding Gokaldas. I note what you say about the desk for Harilal.

As it is the unfortunate Indians who have to appeal as a 	rule, or rather go through the farce of an appeal, this fresh 	imposition makes their lot harder still and makes attainment of 	justice prohibitive. We are perilously near to being asked next time 	to pay the travelling expenses of judges. The rule, however, it 	seems to us, is clearly ultra vires.

Indeed, if we are correctly informed in the recent appeals no such deposits were required or made.

284,,THOSE FINGER-IMPRESSIONS,"
    
 
 Our Johannesburg correspondent draws attention to a very serious state of affairs, if true. It appears that, in spite of the disallowance or suspension of the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, the Asiatic Department has been proceeding as if the Ordinance had been allowed. It appears that the authorities have been inspecting permits and registration certificates held by British Indians, and at the same time, taking their ten finger-prints. There appears to be no justification for this high-handed action. We have nothing to say against the examination of permits and registration certificates— indeed, we consider it to be a proper thing, and the only remedy for weeding out of the Colony those British Indians or Asiatics who may have entered it without permits. But examination is one thing, and, under its cover, to call upon British Indians to give their finger- impressions distinctly another. The British Indians have consented to give their thumb-prints as a matter of grace and conciliation. The authorities should be satisfied therewith. Mr. Henry has shown that thumb-prints are, when properly taken, an invaluable test of identification. It is, therefore, a gratuitous insult to offer to the community to take their finger-impressions. We congratulate the British Indian Association on having moved so promptly in  the  matter. Our correspondent informs us also that the British Indian Association has circularized all the sub-committees warning them
 
 
 
 against giving finger-impressions, and informing them that there is absolutely no law justifying such a degrading procedure.libtech_366_footnote

You state that those British Indians who are here should not be 	indiscriminately admitted to those political rights and privileges 	they do not enjoy in their own country. My Association has several 	times pointed out in your columns that the British Indian community 	of the Transvaal has no intention whatever of claiming, and in fact 	does not claim, any political rights and privileges at all in this 	Colony. British Indians simply demand the most elementary of civil 	rights, which is an entirely different matter.

286,,ENGLISH LIBERALITY,"
    
 
 We have often had to write about the oppression we suffer at the hands of Englishmen. We are very glad now to have an occasion for speaking well of them while thinking of the coming restoration of Dutch rule in the Transvaal. The defeat of the Dutch in the war proved English tenacity. The British, even when thrown flat on the ground, do not accept defeat, call it a virtue or a failing. Once the war started, they alone knew how to win it.
 The British saw, during the war, that the Dutch were not a people to be easily beaten; they too would not accept defeat. In defeat, the Dutch had truly won. Had they not been just a handful, they could never have been defeated. That was the impression they made on the British. Moreover, the British were shrewd enough to see that, in declaring war on the Dutch, they were themselves mainly at fault.
 The party which had declared and fought the war was defeated at the last election. The Liberals won and they decided to hand over the reins of Government to the Dutch. As a result, General Botha and his colleagues have formed the Transvaal Ministry. Though they are now British subjects in the Transvaal, they are quite free. They will now be able to take into the public services as many Dutchmen as they wish. The air is thick with talk of helping the poor among the Dutch. And the Dutch language has today gained in prestige by fifty per cent. The Dutch are now to be seen in every town and village as before. They are flushed with enthusiasm and are again in high spirits.
 No matter what the Dutch have done to us, we ought to congratulate them, considering that they deserve what they have  gained. This [attitude] is an outstanding illustration of English liberality. It is a matter of joy for us that we are associated with such a people.
 We have a lesson to learn from this. Why do the Dutch and the British both hate us? We believe the root cause is not the colour of our skin, but our general cowardice, our unmanliness and our pusillanimity. They will begin to respect us the moment we impress upon them that we can stand up to them. There is no need actually to fight, but courage is necessary. If a man kicks us, we take it lying down. He therefore thinks that we deserve nothing better. This is the
 
 cowardice in us. There is a kind of courage in receiving  a  blow without returning it; but we are not speaking of that courage here. We receive kicks passively out of fear.
 Making a false show of youthfulness, we waste our manhood in sensual pleasures and abuse our womenfolk. Without understanding the true significance of marriage, we remain blindly  absorbed  in carnal enjoyment. This is an example of our unmanliness.
 In the Cape, we give our photographs [for proving our identity] In Rustenburg and Boksburg, out of fear, we give our finger-prints. Instead of entering the Transvaal openly and boldly, some of us do so wrongfully and surreptitiously. This shows our pusillanimity.
 We are well aware that these comments do not apply to all of us. But the whole community has to suffer for such conduct on the part of a few. That is the state we are in, and, we believe, we shall get out of  it soon if, instead of finding fault with the British, we realize our own faults. For the British who have today handed over the reins of Government to the Dutch will likewise give us our due.

287,,WARNING TO TRANSVAAL INDIANS,"
    
 
 It is shameful of the Rustenburg Indians to have surrendered their freedom by giving their full hand-prints. As the Gujarati proverb says, so long as the axe does not have a wooden handle to it, it cannot cut wood. Rustenburg has served as the handle by starting the giving of finger-prints. If, as a result, the Indian community comes to harm, the blame will be with the Rustenburg Indians. We are glad to find that prompt action has been taken by the British Indian Association.libtech_367_footnoteIt is well that it has lodged a protest with the Government whose action appears to be totally illegal. It is also a good thing that the Association has addressed letters to the Indian committees in all the towns.libtech_368_footnote
 This instance shows that the Transvaal Indians have to act with great caution. Whatever steps are taken now should be taken  in  concert and in consultation with the Association. Nothing need be
 
 done out of fear of the officials. Why, and of whom, should we be afraid? When brave women are fighting for their rights in England, it should not be too much for the Transvaal Indians to fight with common courage.

Writing strongly on the subject, the London Times says that the movement should be suppressed. We do not believe it likely that it can be stopped thus. There are some brave  persons  among the Egyptians; and education is widespread. If the movement continues long enough, we believe that the British will grant self- government to the Egyptians. In keeping with British traditions it has first to be shown that people who make demands are prepared to die for them. It is not enough to go on making verbal demands. The British follow this rule in their own country and that is how they endure.

289,,LICENCE CASE,"
    
 
 The Indian licence case of Port Shepstone which has been decided by the Supreme Court appears to be a discomfiture for us. Yet, we need not get into a panic on that account. We can use the case to convince the [Imperial] Government that, under the licensing act, the Indian community can never get justice. Success in Mr. Goga’s caselibtech_370_footnotewas just fortuitous. The danger will remain so long as courts of law do not deal out pure justice. Mr. Ramsay Collins has shown that
 
 the Town Councils are not capable of doing justice. We are not enamoured of the Supreme Court, but we want the right to appeal to that Court only because we know that we can get justice there. If the Europeans oppose this, it only means that they fear justice. In this matter the real campaign is to be waged through the Imperial Government. We are convinced of the need to work for a solution at both levels bearing in mind that we may not succeed. We are of the opinion that, as long as the Imperial Government does not exercise control or exert pressure over the local governments, we shall not succeed, nor can we win their favour. We should bear this in mind and work at both ends.

 Mr. James Godfrey who went to England for his education has now returned a barrister-at-law. We congratulate him and extend to him a cordial welcome. It is a day of joy for his parents and a proud day for the Indian community.
 There will be very few parents in South Africa who have had the courage to take the risks which the Godfreys have taken for their children. They have used all their property to give their sons and daughters a very good education. If other Indian parents were to
 follow this example in large numbers, the bonds that bind the Indian community would soon break. All of us admit the pressing need for education, but we are slow in acting on the belief.
 Though Mr. James Godfrey has finished his academic education, he will start his [real] education only now. Education is just a means. If it is not accompanied by truthfulness, firmness, patience and other virtues, it remains sterile, and sometimes does harm instead of good. The object of education is not to be able to earn money, but to improve oneself and to serve the country. If this object is not realized, it must be taken that the money spent on education has been wasted. We hope Mr. James Godfrey will put his education to good use and pass on the benefit of his learning to the Indian community.

291,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 PERMIT LAW
 The authorities seem to have begun the examination of permits in every town. Not only were the permits of Rustenburg Indians examined, but the police made them give their finger-prints  also.  After the finger-prints had been taken, the  Rustenburg Indians referred the matter to the Association and were told that none of them should have given finger-prints. The giving of finger-prints has done no good. It is likely that the authorities will cite this instance of some Indians who gave finger-prints and argue that the Indian community had no objection to giving finger-prints. The British Indian Association has written letters to every town saying that the permits and the registers may both be produced for inspection on demand; that the authorities may be assisted in their work of scrutiny and all information required by them supplied; that thumb-impressions may be given if required, but that any further demand may  be unequivocally refused and the Association informed that the authorities demand finger-prints. All Indians must bear these four points in mind.
 A telegramlibtech_371_footnotehas been sent to the Government saying that the people regard it an outrage that finger-prints should have been taken at Rustenburg. The question has been asked on whose orders the prints were taken and whether or not the practice would be discontinued. The Transvaal Indians should take care that they do not get caught in the net that the authorities spread for them.
 In reply to the Association’s telegram, the authorities have inquired whether the objection is only to giving the impressions of all the fingers or if it extends to the thumb-impression also. In its replylibtech_372_footnotethe Association has stated that, in accordance with the understanding with Lord Milner, it has no objection to Indians giving the thumb- impression for obtaining permits. The Association intends to assist the Government in the scrutiny of permits, but cannot agree about the giving of the ten fingerprints as this needlessly humiliates the Indian community.
 
 TRANSVAAL PERMITS
 Last week I wrote about the notice regarding persons staying in the Transvaal without permits,libtech_373_footnoteIn answer to an enquiry by the British Indian Association, Mr. Chamney has replied that those persons in the Transvaal who hold the old Dutch certificates will have permits issued to them up to March 31, and that all those who continue to live in the Transvaal after that date without permits will be prosecuted. From this it is not to be inferred that a permit will necessarily be issued to anyone who holds the Dutch certificate. These persons will have to produce evidence to the effect that the Dutch certificate belongs to the holder, and the holder was in the Transvaal immediately before the outbreak of the war and left the Colony because of it.
 Every Indian resident in the Transvaal who possesses such evidence should take out a permit as soon as practicable. But it should be remembered that, unless the applicant is granted a permit, he is not to surrender his register.
 TRANSVAAL RULERS
 General Botha has now completed the formation of his Ministry. He has himself become Prime Minister; General Smuts has become the Colonial Secretary. Mr. De Villiers heads the Departments of Justice and of Mines. Mr. Hull is in charge of the Treasury, Mr. Rissick is the Minister for African Affairs and Mr. E. P. Solomon, the Head of the Public [Works?] Department. Sir Richard Solomon has declined to accept any office. Among the ministers, the Indian community will have to do mostly with Mr. De Villiers  and  Mr. Smuts. It now remains to be seen what course things will take.

He was also honoured and garlanded at the Surati mosque on Friday. Mr. Amod Saleji came to South Africa 22 years ago and is now forty-two years old. He is visiting India after ten years. Mr. Saleji is expected to leave Durban Port on March 20. It will take him nearly ten days to reach Durban from Johannesburg as on his way he will stop at many places which he has been invited to visit.

 The British Indian Association has received a communication from the Government about the Barberton Location. It says that the Location will be made over to the municipality and that a 21-year lease can be taken out from that body.
 INCREASE IN SOUTH AFRICA COMMITTEE’S EXPENDITURE
 Last Sunday a meeting of the British Indian Association and the Anti-Indian-Law Fund Committee took place at the residence of Haji Ojer Ally. Many members were present. The Committee unanimously resolved to increase to £15 the nominal monthly honorarium that is being paid to Mr. Ritch and to remit an additional sum of £100 for the purpose. It is a fact that there has thus been an addition of £100 to the sum of £300 originally fixed for remission to the Committee. It will be difficult to secure a full-time worker as capable even on a salary of £30. If Mr. Ritch had been well to do, he would not have cared to accept even this honorarium. Every week we hear of his activities.

The meeting seems to have been the largest on record. The Advertiser calls it “a record gathering, both in regard to the size of the audience and its enthusiasm”. Delegates attended from all parts of the Colony and perfect unanimity prevailed. We congratulate the indefatigable Secretaries of the Congress on the admirable manner in which they organized the meeting.
 The studiously moderate address of the chairman of the meeting and the array of facts presented by him should disarm all opposition. Nothing could be fairer than the compromise offered by him on the intricate trading question. Indeed Mr. Dawad Mahomed showed that he claimed for the Indian traders nothing more than what the reasonably-minded colonists have admitted they are entitled to at the very least. The first resolutionlibtech_375_footnoteadopted by the meeting put in a concrete form the grievance of the community regarding the Licenses Act. There can be no doubt that nothing less than an amendment of the present Act will satisfactorily meet the difficulty.
 The second resolutionlibtech_376_footnotewas the outcome of the recent licensing cases. The contention of the Indian community is that, if with the possession of the municipal franchise by the Indian community, Indians have laboured under gross injustice at the hands of the municipal bodies, how much worse must the position become if the community is deprived of the municipal franchise. The meeting, therefore, emphasized the necessity for protecting British Indian rate- payers of Natal against the attempt to deprive them of the right to elect municipal councillors.
 
 The two resolutions form a complete answer to the Colonial Patriotic Unionand show how necessary it is for the heads of the two communities to meet together and evolve a workable compromise. Let us hope that Mr. Poynton, who we believe is a moderate man, will consider our proposal and win the esteem of the colonists by paving the way to a real settlement of the thorny question of Indian immigration and Indian competition.

293,,LORD SELBORNE’S DESPATCH,"
    
 Lord Selborne’s despatch to Lord Elgin on the anti-Asiatic Ordinance of the Transvaal has now been received. We regret to have to say that, in spite of His Excellency’s usual fairness, he has throughout the despatch shown himself as a partisan rather than an unprejudiced administrator and representative of the Sovereign.
 We will deal for the present with the alleged influx of unauthorized Asiatics into the Transvaal. We must unhesitatingly say that His Excellency has not produced a particle of evidence in support of the statement so repeatedly challenged by the Indian community of the Transvaal. The evidence referred to by Lord Selborne is the report made by Mr. Burgess as to his examination of Indian passengers at the Coast. It shows at best nothing more than that some Indians attempt to enter the Transvaal on permits not their own, and that such attempt is successfully arrested in its progress, even before Indians making the attempt have reached the Transvaal border. Now the attempt on the part of individual Indians to effect an entry into the Transvaal without lawful authority has never been denied. There is, however, no warrant for the inference, based on such attempts, that there is any successful entry. As to the allegation of “an organised agency trafficking in permits”, there is not a tittle of evidence produced beyond undisclosed circumstances which have come to his (the Coast Agent’s) knowledge. It is now the clear duty of the British Indian Association to call for the production of the evidence on which the statement is founded. Till then, the case for the introduction of the Ordinance remains “unproven”.
 Notwithstanding the fact, we find The Transvaal Leader basing an inflammatory article on Lord Selborne’s despatch. The Leader
 
 gravely asks whether British Indians are to rule South Africa or the white men. And all this because Lord Elgin has dared to do justice in the teeth of official opposition. The Leader then goes on furiously to urge that any such attempt on the part of British Indians to rule South Africa should be resisted, if need be, by the shedding of blood. We may, however, assure The Leader that no such heroic measures will be necessary, seeing that British Indians have no ambition to rule. We would ask our contemporary to peruse the statementlibtech_377_footnotepresented by the Deputation to Lord Elgin and we promise that it will show why it was that Lord Elgin vetoed the Ordinance.

 "
294,,MASS MEETING IN NATAL,"
    
 We print elsewhere a reportlibtech_378_footnoteof the mass meeting at Durban, to which we invite the attention of all our readers. That such a large meeting was held and attended by delegates from different places is evidence of the earnestness and energy of the Congress Secretaries. The resolutions passed at the meeting are bound to have some effect on the Imperial Government as also on the local Government. But we must sound a note of warning that the effect produced so far will disappear if we do not follow up the resolutions with appropriate action, and we shall then be falling from the flame into the fire.libtech_379_footnote
 Such meetings have always to be followed up with much work. In pursuance of these resolutions we shall have to write letters to the Government and trouble them again and again. We may even have to send telegrams. All this work will cost money. We should remember that the Congress has no money now. All the money has been  borrowed from banks. It is difficult to organize a big struggle in these circumstances. Therefore the first need is to collect money.
 The second thing is to remember Mr. Peeran Mahomed’s warning. As long as we do not learn to keep our houses clean, we are bound to suffer. That means that, if we want any good to come out of such big meetings, we must reform ourselves.

295,,“INDIAN OPINION”,"
    
 Some well-wishers have suggested that the Gujarati  section should be expanded. They believe that people have begun to realize the value of Indian Opinion and its services. We have accepted the suggestion and added some pages in this issue itself, and from now on we shall have thirteen instead of twelve pages [of Gujarati]. We hope that this increase in size will be appreciated. We must, however, point out that Indian Opinion is not yet in a position even to pay full wages to its workers. It is only because they have some patriotic fervour that the journal continues to come out.

296,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 ORDINANCE  BLUE BOOK
 The Blue book containing the correspondence that passed between Lord Selborne and Lord Elgin regarding the Ordinance has now been received. It shows that Lord Elgin, who had heard only one side of the case, had at first approved the Ordinance, but his eyes were opened after he had heard the Deputation that visited England, and then he refused it [Royal] assent.
 Lord Selborne, however, sticks to his earlier position and says in his reply that his hands have been weakened by Lord Elgin listening to the Deputation.
 Among the reasons for passing the Ordinance, Lord Selborne mentions many Indians entering without permits. In support he quotes the report of Mr. Burgess, which says that he had personally seen several Indians holding false permits and that some had even erased the thumb-impressions on them. Even if some of these statements are true, it only shows that people are not able to enter wrongfully and that those attempting to do so can in fact be stopped. There are some more points worth noticing in Lord Selborne’s letter, which we shall see later.
 Commenting on this Blue book, The Leader and The Star say
 
 that, whatever the situation may be, the Indians will be registered. The Leader goes so far as to say that the whites will even fight to achieve their object. The Association is preparing to reply to the statements in the Blue book.
 PERMIT CASES
 Cases of possession of false permits occur occasionally in Johannesburg. Some persons were arrested recently, and are being served with notices to leave the Colony. It is because people enter in this manner that the other Indians have to suffer so much hardship.
 GENERAL BOTHA AND HIS MINISTRY
 The residents of Pretoria gave a dinner to General Botha and his cabinet colleagues. Many prominent persons attended it. In his speech General Botha thanked the British and acknowledged that they had been very liberal in handing over the reins of Government to the Boers. As a result, the Dutch would remain loyal subjects of King Edward. The General further said that the Transvaal had been very much in the public eye, but that the people should let bygones be bygones and give the country a respite so that measures to promote its prosperity could be undertaken. The Boers wished to live happily and allow others to do likewise. They would treat the Kaffirs justly and would not harass the mine-owners. The Dutch and the British, as  indeed the Dutch and English languages, were equal in his eyes.
 This speech was generous and conciliatory. If it is lived up to, every one will be able to live happily under the Dutch regime.

 "
301,,THE MALAY LOCATION,"
    
 
 The Johannesburg Town Council, as will be seen from our news columns, will very shortly receive title to the Malay Location. One of the conditions of the grant will be that the Town Council will have to compensate the inhabitants for the buildings erected by them and to find other Stands in lieu of those now occupied. At first sight, the provision seems to be equitable. But further consideration will reveal the fact that compensation does not include any payment in respect of the tenure or loss of rents, and so far as the present intentions of the Council are known, the giving of Stands means removal to Klipspruit. Stand-holders in the Malay Location, though, strictly speaking, only monthly squatters, were, up to the outbreak of war, at least as safe in their possession of Stands as the burghers of Vrededorp who occupied the Stands precisely on the same terms as the residents of the Malay Location. When, therefore, we compare the handsome treatment meted out to the burghers with the treatment that is likely to be the lot of the residents of the Malay Location under the Government grant,  we realize fully what the possession of a brown skin means. If  the Coloured people cannot show a legal title to anything they enjoyed during the Boer regime, their equitable right, no matter how strong, receives short shrift under the changed conditions. Will Lord Selborne once more maintain that the change from the Republican  to  the  British flag necessitates a partial robbery of the rights of the residents of the Malay Location? For the paltry compensation that the Stand- holders will receive for the buildings can ill repay them for years of undisturbed occupation which enables many a holder to derive a handsome income from rents paid by sub-tenants and which is their means of livelihood. And to add force to our argument, let us for the hundredth time recall the fact that every attempt made by the late President Kruger to remove the inhabitants of the Location not
 
 thirteen miles from Johannesburg, but five miles, was successfully resisted by their late advocates, the representatives of the British Crown in the Transvaal.

 "
302,,SOUTH AFRICA BRITISH INDIAN COMMITTEE,"
    
 
 We suggest that all our readers carefully read Mr. Ritch’s letter this week. The work done by him, and through him by the British Committee, has been invaluable. He has been working with great enthusiasm and tact. We shall owe it to Mr. Ritch and the South Africa British Indian Committee if the Natal Municipal Bill is dropped, if the Vrededorp Indians receive compensation and if relief is secured at last from the oppressive Natal Licenses Act. Mr. Ritch will not be able to work without the Committee, and without Mr. Ritch, the Committee cannot do much. There is at present no one in London who can replace Mr. Ritch for vigilance and ability. Sir Muncherji and our other well-wishers do all they can to help us but not much can be done unless there is an able Secretary to bring them all together and to work under their guidance. Almost weekly we see from Reuter’s cables that the Committee is active. Last week the news was received that, in pursuance of the resolution passed at the mass meeting [in Durban], the Committee had written strongly to Lord Elgin. This week we find that a debate was initiated by Lord Ampthill in the House of Lords. The report and cablegrams printed elsewhere in this issue will show that, in the House of Commons too, questions were asked and answered about our grievances. We owe all this to the efforts of the Committee and Mr. Ritch. It is clear that they have been making considerable effort. How is the Committee to continue and do more work? Mr. Ritch has himself supplied the answer. He writes that £250  a year will not suffice. We have published elsewhere the accounts submitted by him showing how the money is spent. Mr. Ritch had been drawing £25 per quarter, but the Committee has permitted him to draw £45, as £25 was not enough to meet even the deficit in his domestic budget. What is paid to Mr. Ritch is not a salary. The market value of his work cannot be less than £30 a month. He does not seek money nor does he work for it. He works because he feels [for the Indians in South Africa]. If his condition permitted it, he would not accept even a penny.
 Among the Committee’s expenses we see payments of £180 to Mr. Ritch, £50 to a paid employee and £50 as rent for the office. Thus salaries and rent took away £280, leaving £20, which was too little to meet the Committee’s other expenses. Even after  we remit
 £50, the balance of the promised £300, the expenses will not be fully met. The Anti-Indian-Law Fund Committee has resolved to send £100 more. But we feel that it is absolutely necessary to spend up to £500 in England. Expenses on this scale will, it appears, have to be maintained over two or three years. If compensation is paid to the Vrededorp Indians, we can recover more than £500 from  that [amount] alone. Our expenses in England will be repaid a hundred times over if our traders can survive in Natal. The attack on the inhabitants of the Malay Location continues. If they can be successfully defended, that also will be a good return. We therefore specifically appeal to all our readers to make the requisite effort to maintain the Committee. The Natal Indian Congress has contributed
 £125. Out of the £50 yet to be sent, the Congress should pay £25 And just as the Transvaal has decided to contribute an additional £100, so must Natal too. That is the duty of the Congress. The Committee will be able to do its best only if money is remitted in this manner.
 At present there is little likelihood of any help coming from the Cape, though efforts are being made. Our request to the Indians in the Cape is that, if it is not possible for them to send a collective contribution, individuals may send us whatever they can. We shall pass on the money, as from them, to the Committee. Even if the Cape Indians consider their own position relatively safe, they should share in their countrymen’s adversities elsewhere.

303,,NATAL INDIAN CONGRESS,"
    
 
 The Natal Indian Congress did very well in holding the mass meeting.libtech_386_footnoteWe can see from Reuter’s cablegram that the Committee has acted promptly on the resolutions passed at the meeting, and written strongly to Lord Elgin. We congratulate the Congress Secretaries.
 
 The Secretary and the Chairman of a body are regarded as its guardians. The enthusiasm they displayed at the mass meeting they should evince in equal measure in the matter of funds for the Congress. The present position of the Congress is so bad that it has been obliged to take an overdraft from the bank. For this Messrs Dawad Mahomed and Omar Haji Amod have furnished personal guarantees. It was very good of them to do so, but the Congress cannot function for long on overdrafts.
 The work on licences is a huge task and a great deal of money will have to be spent on it. To get the [Dealers’] Licenses Act changed will require considerable effort as well as money. The Congress, therefore, ought immediately to collect funds for the struggle over the licences and the municipal bills. Delay in this respect, we feel, will only mean repentance later.
 We understand that the Congress has started raising contribu- tions. We advise every patriotic Indian to help the Congress promptly and to the best of his ability.
 To the Secretary and the Chairman we have to say that their first duty as guardians of the Congress is to place its finances on a sound footing. We are sure that a month’s enthusiastic effort on their part will place the Congress in a comfortable position.

304,,MALARIA AND DUTY OF INDIANS,"
    
 
 Malaria is taking a heavy toll in the neighbourhood of Durban. It is said that nearly three hundred Indians have been buried on the other side of Umgeni. The Corporation has started distributing quinine free of charge. One philanthropic European has undertaken to supply medicine to all patients. Many Indians have availed themselves of his offer.
 At this juncture the Indian community should not lag behind. We think it necessary that the leaders should come out, and go from place to place making inquiries about the victims of the disease and also arrange for their treatment. People should be persuaded to maintain cleanliness and not let water stagnate in the vicinity. The Congress should write to Dr. Murison for help. We believe that it is
 the duty of Dr. Nanji to come forward at this time and give medical aid to patients. If he does so, Indians will have much relief and he will be able to do them a lot of good.
 For the guidance of those who wish to help, we make the following suggestions: 1. simple food for the patient; 2. quinine as prescribed by the physician; 3. ensuring proper bowel movement; 4. removing vegetation, if any, from the neighbourhood; 5. draining of swamps, if any; 6. advising people to use mosquito-nets where possible; 7. the avoidance of overcrowding; 8. cleanliness of latrines, and night-soil to be covered with dry earth or ash.
 These suggestions are very easy to carry out. It has been found that a malarious region becomes free from disease as soon as the land in the neighbourhood is drained.

305,,PERMIT DEPARTMENT,"
    
 The report of the Volksrust permit case which we print elsewhere is worth reading. The case of Shaikh Inas also brings out many things. It is interesting to know how far Mr. Burgess interferes in Durban. Not only does he examine those without permits but even others who have them. It is quite evident that this procedure is improper. For earlier when the person concerned appeared in court, the magistrate found his case in order, held his permit to be valid and acquitted him. Yet Lord Selborne relies on Mr. Burgess’s report and has made out that many persons come in with forged permits or none at all.
 The case of Abdul Rehman is equally important. He will produce witnesses who know him, and thus have himself acquitted. But he would not have been able to come in either, if Mr. Burgess had had his way.
 We feel that, if the Natal Indian Congress makes some effort in this matter, it can secure redress. This kind of thing is happening in Durban, and hence it is within the purview of the Congress. It can ask Mr. Smith and the Natal Government under what authority they carry out searches on board steamers.

306,,HISTORY OF ISLAM,"
    
 The Spectator is one of the famous journals published in Britain today. Prince Tiano is a great Italian writer and has studied Eastern languages. At present he is writing a history of Islam and intends to publish it in twelve parts. The first part has already been published. It is priced at £.1.12.0 and runs into 740 pages of a large size. A review of this book has appeared in The Spectator of December 22, of which we give a summary below:
 Prince Tiano gives in the first part the history of the first six years of the Prophet’s life, in which we see the Prophet as a statesman, law-maker and general. His power was growing from day to day. The Jews opposed him strongly, but the Prophet broke their power. Though there was not much pomp and splendour about him, his power was very great. What he did, no other religious teacher has done. He started preaching after the age of forty. His was not a struggle for self-interest, but for the good of others. At the time of his death he was the head of a theocratic state. He established a religion which came to enjoy world-wide allegiance, thanks to his greatness and sense  of justice. He gave the Arabs a practical knowledge  of world affairs, which they had lacked. He moulded them into a single people and made them doughty fighters. He ruled over different peoples; and today, though Muslims live under different governments, they believe in one God and His Prophet and maintain fraternal relations with others of the same faith. What the nature of this brotherhood is and what the Muslim community can do in the modern world has to be considered whenever we think of the pan-Islamic movement.
 The foregoing is just a summary. We have omitted a considerable portion which is critical. But we would advise those who know English to read the whole article.

 GENERAL BOTHA
 General Botha’s name is on everybody’s lips here. Everywhere the reaction to his speech has been very good. The Times has written favourably of it and rates him very highly. Others too could have said what General Botha did. But the British have a special affection for one who speaks generously after having proved his valour in battle. The lesson for us is that the Indian community too should show courage.
 A move is afoot here to give a dinner to General Botha and his colleagues in the Ministry as was done at Pretoria. It is said that the dinner will be at the Carlton Hotel on the 23rd.
 General Botha is to go to England to attend the [Colonial] Conference. We have suggested to our Committee in London that they should meet him and put our case before him.
 TRANSVAAL PARLIAMENT
 The Transvaal parliament is meeting on the 21st. Every one is anxious to know what it will do. The parliament will not be in session for long, and will adjourn after a sitting of two or three days only.
 RAILWAY HARDSHIPS
 The difficulties on the railways still continue. Mr. Osman Latief has addressed a letter to the Manager about the inconvenience he had to undergo. Correspondence is still going on between the Association and the General Manager over the right of Indians to travel by the morning and evening trains between Pretoria and Johannesburg. The Manager has replied that the existing rules cannot be changed, where upon the Association has pointed out that the arrangement agreed upon was temporary, that it had resulted in much hardship, and hence the repealing of the provision preventing Indians from travelling by these trains is a felt need.
 
 DELAGOA BAY RAILWAY
 There has been a serious accident on the Delagoa Bay Railway. Many passengers lost their lives in a landslide. One of them was Dr. Jameson, a former Minister for Lands. He retired when the new Ministry was formed, and was proceeding to England. True to the saying “Man proposes, but God disposes”, Dr. Jameson died in this accident before reaching England. His body was taken back to Pretoria and buried there.
 ON THE ACCIDENT
 The accident gives rise to many reflections. Others died besides Dr. Jameson. Some were injured. Again, two hundred lives were lost when a French man-of-war was wrecked near Toulon. Incidents such as these are constantly taking place but, intoxicated with this world of affairs, we see nothing. As children, we read [in Gujarati]
 Know, O Man, know thy mind
 And be afraid of death.
 Beware of the destined hour
 To ashes thou shalt turn.
 We live on in the world as if we had come here with a charter of immortality; and as the Gujarati proverb goes, we go on killing buffaloes for shoe-laces. But if we reflect seriously and look at things calmly, we realize that all is done in vain which is not done for others’ good. If every minute, hour and day given to us is spent in good deeds, in patriotic service and in maintaining truth, we shall have nothing to fear even when death strikes us down. Only a person who risks his life can fetch pearls from the depths of the sea. Similarly, from the ocean of life we have to seek out tasks precious like pearls. He alone who does not care for his life can do this. If our actions are effeminate, we cannot remain manly. Lord Selborne has made a biting remark that we are base and in the face of the least danger we think of bribing the officials. We can refute this charge only if we have true spirit within us.
 GIVING OF FINGER-PRINTS
 That this was started at Rustenburg I have already mentioned.libtech_387_footnoteNow the Association has received a letter from the Rustenburg
 
 Committee saying that the paper on which the finger-prints of some people were obtained at the instance of the Committee has been burnt. For this Rustenburg deserves our congratulations. Indians in other places should heed this warning and not give the ten finger- impressions under any circumstances.
 VREDEDORP ORDINANCE
 It has been suggested by the Johannesburg municipality that the Vrededorp Ordinance may be put into effect from July 1. Meanwhile, the South Africa British Indian Committee has been active about obtaining compensation.
 MALAY LOCATION
 On the subject of handing over the Malay Location to the Johannesburg Town Council, the Government have written that, as soon as it agrees to certain conditions, it will be granted a permanent lease. One of the conditions is that, should the Council evict the residents of the Malay Location, it should provide suitable Stands elsewhere for the evicted and also pay compensation, as determined by a tribunal, for buildings already erected by them in the Location.
 This means that the inhabitants of the Malay Location will not be compensated for their right to the Stands which, for many years now, they have believed to be theirs; only the present value of the structures will be paid. That is to say, the payment will vary from £50 to £150. The Malay Location Committee should start an agitation from today. It is probable that the agreement between the Government and the Council will soon be signed.
 PERMITS
 Only a few days now remain for those persons who are now resident in the Transvaal, hold old registers but had left the territory just before the war, to apply for new permits.  It  should  be remembered that, after March 31, no applications will be entertained.

 DEAR SIR WILLIAM,
 I am obliged to you for your letter regarding Dr. Oldfield’s contributions. I write this to request your very active interest in the matter of the Ordinance, which has been re-introduced in the new parliament. I venture to think that the matter has not been discussed in India, as it might be. The result will be that it will not be thoroughly dealt with by the publicists in India.
 I had a letter from Mr. Frazer of The Times of India saying that, if the idea of a special committee for this purpose were taken up, he would gladly co-operate. If you could kindly suggest to public men in India the desirability of forming such a committee, I think that it will be taken up.

I think, therefore, it would perhaps be as well to send 	here next week 200 copies, because there is bound to be a very great 	demand. You may also send about 2 dozen copies of the current issue. 	I have instructed Hemchand to accept payment from those who may come 	here on the promise of supplying them with a copy. If they cannot be 	sold, I will keep them. You will, of course, take care for the 	present to print one or two hundred extra copies over and above the 	copies requisitioned. The two hundred copies for next week must be 	included in the requisition.  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI    From 	a photostat of the typewritten original: S. N. 4724

 [JOHANNESBURG,
 March 29, 1907] [Resolution 1]libtech_392_footnoteThis meeting of British Indians, convened  under
the auspices  of  the   British  Indian  Association,   hereby respectfully
 protests against the passage of the Asiatic Law Amendment Bill by the new Transvaal Parliament, in that the Bill is  unnecessary and degrading to the British Indian community.
 [Resolution 2]libtech_393_footnoteThis meeting of British Indians convened under the auspices of the British Indian Association denies the allegation of illegal influx of British Indians on a wholesale scale, and, in order to satisfy the Government and popular prejudice, offers to submit to voluntary regis tration, as was done by the community in 1904 under Lord Milner’s advice, and in the manner sketched in the Chairman’s speech thus practically fulfilling all the requirements of the  Bill without its offensive character.
 [Resolution 3]libtech_394_footnoteIn the event of the humble proposal embodied in Resolution 2 not being accepted by the local Government, this meeting hereby requests full Imperial protection by reason of the fact that British Indians have no voice in the choice of the legislators, and represent a very small and weak minority.
 [Resolution 4]libtech_395_footnoteThat the Chairman be, and is, hereby authorized to submit the resolutions passed by this meeting of British Indians, by wire or cable, to the local Government and to the Right Hon’ble the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Right Hon’ble the Secretary of State for India, and His Excellency the Governor-General of India.

314,,THE DEALERS’ LICENSES ACT,"
    
 
 The replylibtech_396_footnoteof the Natal Government to the Natal Indian Congress regarding the imposition of a heavy fee against a rule under the Dealers’ Licenses Act is very unsatisfactory, except in so far as the reply shows an anxiety on the part of the Government to justify its action; but the analogy given from the Liquor Licences and the Road Boards Act is entirely misleading. The Liquor Licences Ordinance and laws are naturally and always restrictive to trade in liquor. The policy of the legislature, therefore, naturally is to put as many obstacles as possible in the way of those licences being multiplied. It may be retorted, it is true, that such is also the policy of the Dealers’ Licenses Act so far as Indians are concerned, but we think that the Government could hardly take up such a position. The hardship created by the Act is great enough in that absolute discretion as to the granting of licences rests with the Appellate Boards. To impose a heavy penalty, for the fee of £12 10s is nothing less, would be, practically, to bar even an approach to these Boards. The analogy of the Road Boards also cannot hold good, because the interests involved are of a totally different nature. They regulate special rights and do not create social disabilities, whereas the Dealers’ Licenses Act specifically restricts a natural right, which has hitherto been considered to be a vested right. We undoubtedly think that it is the duty of the Congress to pursue the matter, until the imposition shall have been removed.

 "
315,,TRANSVAAL ASIATIC ORDINANCE,"
    
 
 The Transvaal Indians are again confronted with the same situation that they faced during September last. Today every one is watching to see what they will do next.
 
 All Indians will be guided by what the Transvaal Indians do. What happens in the Transvaal may well happen all over South Africa.
 “NOTHING VENTURE, NOTHING HAVE”
 According to the saying, “Nothing venture, nothing have,” if the Transvaal Indians do not rigidly adhere to the resolution on going to gaol, they will lose everything. Not only they, but other South African Indians also will lose their rights.
 If the Indian community in the Transvaal does not carry out the resolution in regard to going to gaol, it will be eating its own words. The Europeans will laugh at the Indians. They will think us timid and cowardly and take it that we shall endure any burden imposed on us. No one will put any faith in our word, whether written or spoken.
 IF BILL IS PASSED
 If this Bill is passed, the Transvaal Government will soon draft other bills, and the Indian community will of its own lose its rights one after another. The laws which obtain in the Orange River Colony will be enacted in the Transvaal also and later in all the other places. There is already talk today of relegating all the traders to Bazaars, of sending people to Klipspruit thirteen miles away from the Malay Location, and entirely abolishing the right of Indians to own land outside a Location. If, therefore, the Indian community abandons the resolution on courting imprisonment, we believe that it will be impossible to get redress in any of the matters.
 If we lose our reputation this time, we shall never recover it. It is our belief that there is nothing worse than withdrawing a threat once held out.
 
 OTHER REASONS FOR OPPOSING ORDINANCE
These are listed below:
  Under 	the Ordinance 	all (existing) 	permits will be 	withdrawn and 	new ones issued after 	fresh inquiry.  These 	permits will have to be 	produced before a 	Kaffir or 	any other constable.  Licences 	will not 	be issued 	to those 	who do 	not produce 	the permits. Even when the permit is produced, the police have the right to 
 
 lock up a man for the night.
  Even 	a child 	of eight 	years will have to be 	registered by 	its parents, 	and its identification 	marks noted.  It 	is not the people 	with forged 	permits or without 	permits who 	will have to 	face this harassment, 	since they will have 	left the Transvaal. 	It is the 	others with 	valid permits who 	will have to go through 	it all.  All 	the officers have 	said that the new permits 	will carry the 	impressions of 	all the ten digits.  There 	is a great 	difference between 	giving our 	thumb- impressions 	in the 	past and the same provision 	under the new law. So 	far, the 	thumb-impression was 	given voluntarily, now it is made 	compulsory under the law.  Hitherto 	the giving 	of thumb-impressions 	was not a 	statutory requirement, 	so that 	it had 	no consequences 	elsewhere, but now under 	the new law, it will 	have consequences everywhere.  If 	a stranger reads 	this Ordinance, 	he will only 	get the impression 	that those to 	whom it 	applies must 	be thieves, 	bandits or traitors.  The 	clauses of 	the Ordinance 	are such that these 	can only 	apply to criminals.  The 	reason advanced 	for the Ordinance 	is also 	of the 	same nature: 	the leaders 	of the 	Indian community 	secure entry for 	Indians into 	the Transvaal under 	false pretexts—which means that 	the leaders are criminals.  The 	Ordinance raises the 	question whether 	the Indian community 	has any status 	at all.  If 	the Indian 	community submits to 	this Ordinance,  the 	result will 	be that 	Indians like 	Sir Muncherji 	Bhownaggree who may 	enter the Transvaal 	will also 	be required to 	take out permits 	with finger-prints. 	The responsibility 	for this 	will rest on the 	Transvaal Indians.  The 	Ordinance applies 	only to 	Asiatics, and 	not to 	Cape Boys, Kaffirs, or 	Malays. That means that 	all these 	three communities will 	laugh at the 	Indians. Supposing an 	Indian marries a 	Malay. No 	one will 	be able 	to ask 	the Malay to 	produce a 	pass, but 	everywhere the 	Kaffir police will 	accost the Indian and 	demand, “Your pass, 
 please!” This means that the status of the Indian will be lower than that of his Malay wife. Other such reasons can also be given. Yeaders should deeply ponder over the foregoing reasons and  consider whether it is not better to go to gaol than to suffer such indignity. To take out a pass under the Ordinance is, we believe, like permanent imprisonment. In comparison with that, there is nothing wrong in going to gaol for a few days or months. On the contrary, besides bringing in some gain, it will redound to our credit. The other permanent imprisonment will cause us loss and discredit. It must be remembered that the resolution about courting imprisonment has already been passed by the Indian community and announced to the whole world. If the Ordinance was not acceptable in December, how can it be so now? As far as that Ordinance is concerned, the pledge about going to gaol must stand for ever. We request the Indian community to bear all this in mind and to adhere firmly to the resolution on courting imprisonment. And we pray to God to give us the courage to renew that pledge.
 BRAVE WOMEN OF BRITAIN
 We still receive cables from Britain regarding the struggle by some brave women. All of them go to gaol instead of paying fines. Though they have not won their rights so far, they have not lost heart. Instead, they believe that even though they themselves may not get the rights, their daughters will get them as a result of their struggle.
 Now about this resolution on gaol-going, no one must argue that he will go to gaol only if all the other Indians do so. It is the man with courage who will have to go to gaol. We have to follow the example of the women referred to above. They go to gaol, though they are very few in number, and thus draw the attention of the world to their cause.
 We earnestly request all our readers to have this article imprinted on their mind, and to act with great deliberation.

316,,DUTY OF CAPE AND NATAL [INDIANS],"
    
 At this juncture, it is the duty of Indians in the Cape and Natal to hold meetings expressing sympathy with the Transvaal Indians. They should, moreover, pass resolutions and send them to the Imperial Government. It will also bc a good thing if Indians from every village and town were to pass resolutions and write to the Government respectfully saying that the law is oppressive and should be withdrawn.  It may be remembered that cablegrams in support of the Transvaal Ordinance were sent to Lord Elgin by whites from every town. Everywhere the speeches should be reasonable and good-tempered.

317,,INDIANS GOING TO LOBITO BAY,"
    
 An Englishman named Stone intends to take Indian labourers to a place called Lobito Bay in Portuguese Africa a thousand miles to the north of the Cape. He wants to take Indians there to work on the railway which a British company is constructing. The question has arisen if the Indian community should encourage this proposal. The President of the Durban Sanitary Association has published certain facts which indicate that the arrangements made by Mr. Stone in Durban for the Indians are altogether bad. The building that he has rented for them is small and insanitary. If this is true, we should consider whether Indian labourers are likely to gain  anything  by going to Lobito Bay. Mr. Stone has also received the permission of the Government of India. He therefore stands in no need of help from the Indian community. But the above instance should make us realize that the Indian community cannot give its consent to such proposals. If need be, it can even register its opposition. We hear that the climate of Lobito Bay is pleasant. It is therefore probable that the Indian labourers will be happy there. Much will depend upon whether the foremen who will accompany them are good men or not.

 ASIATIC ORDINANCE
 In just two days the new Transvaal parliament passed the Ordinance exactly as it stood in September last. On the 20th the Ordinance was introduced in the Assembly, and the same day, within two hours, it went through all the three readings and was immediately sent to the Legislative Council, where, at the instance of Mr. Martin, it was postponed to the 22nd so that Members could have time to study it.libtech_397_footnoteBut this was merely a pretence. How were the Members to digest it in one night? The Legislative Council passed it on the 22nd.
 TELEGRAM FROM ASSOCIATION
 No one ever dreamt that the Bill would be passed in this manner. When the Association came to know of it, it immediately sent a telegram to the Council to the following effect:
 The Association finds with great sorrow that the Asiatic Bill has already been passed in the Assembly and is likely to pass through the Council today. The Association humbly requests that, until the Association’s plea in the matter has been heard, further consideration of the Bill may be postponed. The Association begs to remind Your Honour that the function of the Council is to protect the interests of those who do not have the franchise. The Indian community is loyal, but is without the right to vote. The Association does not at all admit the charge that there is a mass infiltration into the Transvaal by Indians. All adult Indians possess permits bearing names and identification marks. Those who are without permits can even now be  deported. It is our request that at the least a commission should be appointed to inquire into the allegation. We feel that the Bill is oppressive and uncalled for. The Association requests redress at the hands of the Council.
 This telegram was read out before the Council, but without any result. Now the Bill has been sent to Lord Elgin for approval.
 
 SPEECHES ON BILL
 The Colonial Secretary, Mr. Smuts, said that the whole white population of the Transvaal was of one mind in the matter. Indians should be stopped from coming in. They come in in large numbers. The Dutch Government attempted to prevent them, and this led to the [Boer] War. The Bill that had been presented that day had come up before the former Council. Its aim was just to have every Indian registered. Law 3 of 1885 was defective, and its drawbacks would be removed in the new Bill. The Imperial Government had vetoed the Bill because it was passed by the former Council. They were now in a position to show that they were unanimous in passing it. Further legislation would be necessary after that Bill had become law; but they would have to look into the matter later. For the time being it was necessary for them to know who had the right to live in the Colony. For these reasons the Bill must be passed the very same day.
 Dr. Krautze supported the motion. Mr. Owen Jones said that all the municipalities demanded such an Act. It was absolutely essential to protect the whites. Mr. Loveday congratulated the Government on its promptness in bringing up the Bill. Mr. Jacobs said that all farmers wanted the Indians driven out. If the Indians were not sent back, they might even dispossess the farmers. The whites could settle in the Transvaal, but not in India. The Indians should not therefore leave their own country.
 General Choke-Burger supported the Bill and so did Sir Percy Fitzpatrick. The Bill was thus passed, and then sent up to the Council.
 
IN THE COUNCIL
 Mr. Curtis said that the Bill must be passed, but that the Council should have a night to consider it, lest anyone in England should think that the Council passed it without due consideration. The Bill was absolutely necessary. From his experience he could say that every month a hundred Indians entered the Transvaal without permits. If, therefore, South Africa was to remain in the hands of the whites, the Bill had to be passed.
 Mr. Martin said that traders and all others had asked for such a Bill and that it should be passed. Mr. Roy congratulated [the Government] on bringing forward the Bill. Mr. Purchas said that the Bill was reasonable and that the Indian contention was not fair.
 Indians were concerned only with their own interests. They did not consider the other side and their English friends were unaware of conditions here.
 
 PRESS COMMENTS
 The Leader, The Daily Mail and The Star make the following comments.
 According to The Leader, Lord Elgin had now no alternative but to give his approval to the Bill. However, in vetoing the former Bill, he had raised a big issue. It was difficult to see how he  could  now approve the present Bill.
 In the opinion of The Rand Daily Mail, the Bill was necessary to prevent Indian infiltration. It was well therefore that it had been  passed. Those who remained in the Transvaal, however, should be able to live a decent life.
 The Star says that Sir Richard Solomon had brought the news that the Bill would receive Royal assent in it was passed by the new parliament. The Bill must therefore be passed now.
 COMMENTS IN ENGLAND
 The Times says that the Transvaal parliament has made a serious mistake in passing the Bill. It did not think of the difficulties of the Imperial Government. The Conservative Globe also says that the Bill should not be approved. The Tribune thinks that it was improper that the Bill should have been passed. But now that General Botha was visiting England, Lord Elgin should be able to find a way out.
 OUR COMMITTEE VIGILANT
 Cables from England show that our Committee there has started a movement in Parliament against the Bill. Furthermore, a  joint meeting of the Committee and the East India Association will take place at Caxton Hall on April 9.
 ASSOCIATION MEETING
 A joint meeting of the British Indian Association and the Anti- Indian-Law Fund Committee took place last Sunday  at  Mr. Coovadia’s residence. It was followed by another meeting of the Hamidia Islamic Society on Monday. At both the meetings, it was solemnly resolved after due consideration to adhere to the Resolution
 about going to gaol. Haji Habib, Secretary of the Pretoria Committee, was present at both the meetings.
 At this meeting a cheque for the money raised for the struggle against the anti-Indian law, which had been so far with the Gujarati Hindu Society, was received as also another for the money that was lying with Mr. Alibhai Akuji. Attempts are now being made to recover the money collected by other persons.
 NEED FOR FUNDS
 Every one can understand that at such a time the need for funds will be great. A long discussion took place at both the meetings on the money which had not yet been received from the mofussil committees. They should remit these amounts immediately.
 MASS MEETING
 It has been decided to hold a mass meeting on Friday, the 30thlibtech_398_footnote. Notices have been sent out to all the places. At the time of writing, it is expected that a large number of people will attend.

 "
322,,A WAY OUT OF DIFFICULTY,"
    
 
 The Indian Mass Meeting, held the other day at Johannesburg, shows the earnestness with which British Indians in the Transvaal are fighting an uphill battle. The central point of the proceedings was undoubtedly the Second Resolution, which embodied the eminently reasonable suggestion made by Mr. Abdool Gani, the Chairman of the Meeting and President of the British Indian Association. If the Transvaal Government have any desire whatsoever to conciliate British Indians and to look at the situation from all points of view, they will accept the proposal without the slightest hesitation. With statesmanlike moderation, British Indians have offered voluntarily to be re- registered; they have offered to exchange the double documents they now hold for another document to be mutually approved; and although there is no legislative compulsion, they have agreed  to submit to certain restrictions which the Government have considered to be necessary. The Second Resolution is at once an earnest of the bona fides of the Indian community, and a way out of a delicate and difficult position. We should be very much surprised if it were not a fact that the Transvaal Ministry is not pining for a tussle with the Imperial Government. It should be thankful to take up the Indian suggestions, nor need Indians be at all frightened over the Resolution.
 Whilst it undoubtedly exposes them once more to irksome procedure, in view of the prejudice existing in the Colony, it is necessary for them to undergo it. The step taken voluntarily will redound to the eternal credit of the community, and it will pave the way for a reasonable settlement of the whole Indian question. Moreover, the  more  the Indian community yields in a dignified manner, the more secure becomes its position in the event of the obnoxious Bill receiving the Royal sanction, and it being necessary for the community to enforce the Fourth Resolution of last September.
 The Natal Advertiser has taken us to task for, as it terms it, “deliberately inciting the Transvaal British Indians to passive resistance”. It is impossible for The Advertiser to enter into the feelings that actuate British Indians. It is not a question of martyrdom, nor is it a question of offering resistance for the sake of it. We have no hesitation in saying that to a loyal and  law-abiding  community, passive resistance, as the proposed going to gaol has been termed for want of a better word, is a recognized method of obtaining redress; as a matter of fact, the going to gaol is a legal method of submission to law. There are four things provided in the Bill: one is to submit to registration; secondly in its absence, to leave the country; thirdly, in the absence of either, to pay a fine if the option is reserved; lastly and fourthly, in the absence of any of the last three, to suffer imprisonment. We cannot conceive that there is anything wrong for a British Indian to accept the last remedy, if he considers  that registration is worse than gaol. It is undoubtedly true that the last method is an extreme step justifiable under exceptional circumstances. Whether or not a particular state creates such circumstances is a matter of opinion, and the prudence of a community is measured by its capacity for finding out the real state operating to justify that method. If, then, all the moderate propositions submitted by the British Indians in the Transvaal fail to carry weight, and if the Imperial Government abdicate their function of protecting the weak against the strong, we re-affirm our opinion that for the Indian community to be considered a self-respecting body, no other course is left open, but with quiet courage and resignation, to prefer gaol to submission to the insult offered by the Bill.

323,,SUGGESTION TO OUR TRANSVAAL READERS,"
    
 This number of Indian Opinion is in our view a very important one. It carries a report of the Transvaal meetinglibtech_402_footnotewhich every one should read carefully. But it is especially necessary to get as many whites as possible to read the English report and to  draw  their attention to the Second Resolution in particular. If they read it in the right spirit, we are sure they will support the suggestion contained therein. If this should happen, the Bill would not come into force. We therefore suggest that each reader order as many copies of  this  number as possible and distribute them among the whites and request them to read it. In the belief that this hope of ours will be realized, we have printed extra copies of this number. Copies may be had from the head office or from our Johannesburg office. A four-penny stamp for each copy may be sent with the order. Merely to pass on a copy to a white without any explanation would be like throwing it away.  It would also be necessary to explain which portion he should read.

324,,TRANSVAAL MASS MEETINGlibtech_403_footnote,"
    
 Hundreds of Transvaal Indians met in Johannesburg on the 29th and passed a number of resolutions. The function went off smoothly without any untoward incident, for which the British Indian Association deserves to be congratulated. The situation at present is not such that, once the meetings are over, we can lapse into inactivity. It is the duty of every Indian to put up sustained resistance. We should bear in mind that the question does not concern the Transvaal alone. Let us think about what we should do if the Bill were passed. No one should presume that, because this mass meeting did not pass a resolution about going to gaol, the idea has been abandoned. We have no other remedy left except going to gaol and, if the Indian  community adheres to this resolve, it may bring in benefits all round.
 
 
 If the Ordinance is passed, Indians must hold meetings in every town and village and inform the Government that they would rather go to gaol than take out passes. We believe it would be wise to  start preparing for such an eventuality from now on. So, if those who are prepared to go to gaol will let us have their names and addresses, we will publish them in this journal. It is necessary to do this; for each will derive strength from the other and even the Government will be unnerved by the publication of the names. We propose to publish these names in the English section also.
 We have already explained to the Natal and Cape Indians their duties in this context.libtech_404_footnoteThey should immediately hold meetings and pass resolutions of sympathy and send these to [the authorities in] England.

325,,NATAL LICENSING ACT,"
    
 We hold that the victory at Harding is no victory at all. The poor applicant was given the licence only after he had cancelled the deed of partnership. This is not justice. Today the appeal court demands this; tomorrow it may demand more. A licence can be had only after meeting the demands of the court [whatever they are]. This is possible only because the Board has excessive powers. It is quite clear from the Harding case that an even bigger struggle against the Natal Licensing Act is necessary.

WELCOME
 It has fallen to me once again to welcome the Indians from Johannesburg and the delegates who have come to participate in the deliberations over important questions concerning our community. The act which was rejected by Lord Elgin has been passed again by the new parliament. Fortunately we were not under any illusion when we welcomed our Delegates on their return from England with the victory they had won. We knew then that our work had just begun. However, none of us had any suspicion at the time that the same law would be re-enacted within 24 hours and that normal parliamentary procedure would be suspended for the purpose.libtech_405_footnoteSuspension of parliamentary procedure is nothing surprising; but it is done only in a great emergency.
 
 
 HOW BILL CAME TO BE PASSED
 If a state of real emergency had arisen and the country had to be saved, we could understand the rushing of a law through parliament; but on this occasion it was merely a fight between the lion and the goat.

 While, on the one hand, there are 250,000 whites who enjoy all political rights and the number goes on increasing monthly because they can enter without restriction, there are, on the other hand, 14,000 Indians whose number, it is said, increases by a hundred a month. It is in order to protect the all powerful whites that the Act to keep out Indians without a permit has been passed. People who do such a thing must be steeped in ill-will against us. Normally, the Act would have been placed before the public for consideration for three months and the champions of the Act, which is to protect the rights of 250,000 whites, would have had to run the risk only of 300 Indians entering the Transvaal.
 HOW IS NEW LEGISLATURE?
 It is deliberately that I describe our legislators as the custodians of the rights of the whites alone. At any rate the members of the Council do nothing else. It is said that the Legislative Council has been charged with the task of preventing the enactment of laws against the blacks.In fact, that this was their duty was urged as a reason when it was demanded that the Bill be postponed for the night. But I must regretfully say that this was merely a ruse. How could the members become familiar in a night with a bill, which was admittedly very important and complicated? How could the Council gauge within a night the feelings and opinions of those whose rights it was supposed to protect? Could the Council have passed the Bill as carelessly if the members had been elected by us? Could it have ignored our humble demand that the Bill be postponed to enable us to place our case before it? To prove that I am not making a mistake when I say this, I quote Mr. Curtis who is believed to be the author of this Bill. He said, ‘I am glad that this Bill has come up before the Council. However, I support Mr. Martin’s motion to postpone consideration of it for a night. If it is passed on the same day on which it is moved without
 discussion in either of the Houses, we shall be placing a very big weapon in the hands of our opponents. The Bill was rejected by Lord Elgin not because of its objects but because of some of its clauses. How many members can claim that they have carefully read all the clauses of the Bill? This Bill is an important and serious one. It raises the question whether this land will continue to belong to the whites or become black.
 DON’T INDIANS THINK?
 While casting his vote in favour of the Bill, Mr. Purchas said that we looked at only one side of the question. We did not look to the interests of the whites. He also said that our English friends did not know the conditions in the Colony. In saying this Mr. Purchas has betrayed his ignorance of our case and of facts about our English friends. For his information I repeat that we know the conditions [of life] of the whites and we want to adapt ourselves to their ideas. That is why we have forgone our political rights and shown  readiness  to accept the law pertaining to trade and immigration without racial discrimination. If anyone says that we accept it because we cannot help it, he will be quite wrong. For had we wanted to do so, we could have fought against it, harassed both the Colonial and  the  India Offices and thus added to their worries. I claim credit for our community for we realized our position without compulsion and did not harass the Imperial Government. Again Mr. Purchas does not know our friends; for, if he did, he would find that many of our friends are renowned veteran Government servants. They would never go over to any party without careful thought. He who would accuse men like Sir William BuIl, Sir Lepel Griffin, and Sir Raymond West of partisanship surely does not know them. It is needless to name the other famous Liberals. It is thanks to them that [the Colony gained responsible government and] members are elected to the Council and the Assembly. Their motive in trying to secure justice for Indians from the rulers of the Transvaal is the same as that which made them show such unexampled generosity towards the Transvaal whites. Both according to them and to us, responsible government means the right to manage one’s own affairs and not the right to tyrannize over others who do not have the vote. The people of the Colony forget this definition of responsible government and disapprove of the  restrictions in the constitution for safeguarding the rights of the
 blacks. And that is why even men like Sir Richard Solomon say that these restrictions are only nominal. This is our lot at  the  very beginning of responsible government.
 LORD SELBORNE
 Our freedom was endangered when the Colony won responsible government; similarly we now become nervous as we read Lord Selborne’s despatches. We had hoped that Lord Selborne, who, before the war, talked about our rights, would now, with better opportunities to do so, protect us the better. But I must respectfully submit that, instead of working as a trustee, he has functioned as a partisan. Instead of having equal regard for all, he has been partial to the whites.
 
“BRIBERY IS RELIGION OF INDIANS”
 Let me comment on some matters mentioned in his communications which are published in the Blue book. His Lordship, on being given information about false permits, levelled an unworthy and painful charge against us. His Excellency said, ‘Those who have come in contact with the people of the East know that they do not look upon getting their work done through bribery as irreligious. Thanks to this state of affairs the permit inspector succumbs to temptation for which he should never be given the opportunity.’ I know nothing about the habit of offering bribes among the people of the East, but I do know that even the lowest among the Indians knows that offering a bribe is bad. I must remind His Lordship that, in 1903, officials in the Asiatic Office at Johannesburg did accept bribes and that it was through the efforts of the British Indian Association that they were caught and dismissed.
 
IS BILL ADVANTAGEOUS TO INDIANS?
 Lord Selborne says  that  the  Bill  is  advantageous  to  the Indian community; but we  have  shown  that  this  is  not  at  all  so. His Lordship therefore accuses us of over-reaching ourselves; but we can accuse him too of doing the same thing. According to him, it is unfair of us to say that [under the Bill] our position becomes inferior to that of the Kaffirs. I repeat what I said. The Kaffirs do not have to take out a pass as we have to; neither have they to have their children registered.
 CHARGE AGAINST SIR LEPEL
 Moreover, His Lordship has levelled a charge against Sir Lepel Griffin also and has criticized him for his remarks on the taking out of passes by women and children. But he has deliberately omitted the fact that Mr. Gandhi corrected Sir Lepel’s minor mistake on the spot.libtech_406_footnoteAnd it is undoubtedly true that children will have to be registered. It must also be noted that the Transvaal Government would have made registration compulsory for women also if they had had their own way.
 
 DO MANY INDIANS ENTER WITHOUT PERMITS?
 Many other matters arise from what Lord Selborne has written; but I cannot give an account of these here. I must mention one fact however. We can offer the same evidence to disprove Lord Selborne’s contention—that many people enter without a permit—which he gives in order to show that they do. For the same proven offences which he uses against us show that the existing system of permits is sufficient to catch holders of faked ones. Those who have presented the facts  before Lord Selborne have not differentiated between those who have already entered with false permits and settled here and others who now try to enter with such permits. And in the charged atmosphere of the Transvaal a single instance of a faked permit appears magnified a hundred folds In his report of September 27, Mr. Chamney says that, during the last six months, 287 persons were found without permits or with false ones. Of these 165 have been found guilty and 122 are in the Colony but cannot be traced. Therefore, if Mr. Chamney’s findings are correct, 21 persons, on an average, enter every month with faked permits or without a permit altogether. Despite these facts, Mr. Curtis maintains that each month 100 Asiatics  enter  in  this manner with faked permits.
 
WHAT ARE WE FIGHTING FOR?
 Our fight is not against particular  clauses  of the  Bill  but  against  the  entire  Bill  and  its  objectives.  It  puts  a  dark  blot   on us; it outrages our feelings. It presupposes that those to whom  it applies  are  criminals.  This  makes  our  position  worse  in   relation  to Kaffirs and Malays, with whom we daily come in contact,
 
 by marking us off from them in an objectionable manner. Conse- quently our status is depressed. Admittedly it no more than wounds our susceptibilities; but such an affront cannot be put up with indefinitely. One does not mind it much if one’s feelings are hurt on rare occasions and in some trivial matter. In fact, such things we suffer daily at the hands of the whites. But when our feelings are hurt on important matters and we are made to look small all the time, it would be cowardice and betrayal of our country for us to endure it all silently. We praise the whites because they think in terms of the future; but if we are sincere in our praise, we must emulate them. When we think of our future, should they not congratulate us? It is only right that they are ever active in defending their rights. Can’t we then exert ourselves to preserve ours?
 WHAT DID WHITES SUFFER?
 When President Kruger made it obligatory for the whites to take out passes, they were highly agitated. All South Africa resounded with protests against the way the late President had, according to them, thought up a way of disgracing them. In the end, the President had to give in, although the humiliation that we are being subjected to is far more serious than theirs. Moreover there was a better reason for taking stringent measures against them, for they were attacking the state. But we have never been accused of any action against states or society. Even the annual report of the Transvaal [Government] states that our people never give the police any trouble. In spite of this, a law has been passed, as I said before, in 24 hours as if we were great crimi- nals, and it now only awaits the sanction of the Imperial Government.
 
INJURY ADDED TO INSULT
 Again, we raise our objection against the law not merely because our  feelings  are  wounded.  It  will  cause  us  great   loss   as   well Our experience is that any law applicable only to a section of the people always causes much suffering. It leads to other consequential enactment’s.   Other   laws   are   framed   on   a    similar    basis.    I  do grant, however, that no Bill can be more  severe  than  this.  But that is no consolation. I can give examples to show that, even where such class legislation was not so designed, it did cause much harm and hardship. Never during the Boer regime was the Law [3] of 1885 enforced as harshly as it is today. Sir Hercules Robinson (later Lord Rosemead) had in fact stipulated that this law would
 not apply to respectable Indians such as traders. But Lord Rosemead’s view passed with him and the law was applied to us according to its literal interpretation. The Bill confers such wide powers on the officials that if they were unsympathetic, it might lead to much harassment.
 EXAMPLE OF NATAL
 Even though the trading law applies both to the white and the black in Natal, it has become oppressive [to the latter]. For there is much divergence between its interpretation [now] and the promises made [at the time of its enactment]. The understanding was that the rights of old traders would not be infringed. This has been thrown to the winds, and no Indian trader seems to be safe because of the way the law is now being enforced. Such insecurity prevails in the Cape too. We too were given promises when the war broke out, but we got nothing besides. We must therefore realize that this Bill brings us to the brink of extinction.
 IF THUMB-IMPRESSION, WHY NOT TEN FINGER-PRINTS?
 We are being asked why, if we had willingly agreed to give the thumb-impressions, should we now object to giving impressions of the ten digits under compulsion? This question would suggest that the whole affair was merely one of the thumb or the fingers. As a matter of fact, our struggle raises a very big issue. Looking at it from another point of view, we find that we do many things willingly and feel no indignity in doing them. But the same things we will not do under compulsion. We look upon the law of compulsory registration as the sting of a scorpion. But mere argument cannot make the whites understand [our point of view]. They have a suspicion that we wish to swamp the Colony with Indians. Mr. Roy believes that, if we did entertain such a desire, it would be but natural. But we deny this. Mr. Smuts has said that the Bill has two objects. One is to separate the Indians who have the right to stay from those who do not have the right. The other is to give Indians, who are lawfully [in the Colony], permits which contain more details so as to enable [the Government] to detect those who enter the Transvaal in the future without a permit. All this can be done very easily, quickly and inexpensively—with the consent of the Indian community—by virtue of the laws that are already in force. We have agreed to help the Government at all times. I, therefore, put forward the following proposal today in your name so that the two objects mentioned by Mr. Smuts can be achieved without having to pass the new Bill.
 THE PROPOSAL
 This was in fact done during Lord Milner’s time and both he and Captain Fowled were happy with the Indian community. This is the proposal that I make:
  The 	Governmnt should 	fix a 	day for the 	simultaneous examination 	of all 	the permits.  Either 	all of 	them should be 	stamped with 	the seal 	of the 	Colonial Secretary or, 	where the existing 	permits are genuine, 	they should 	be replaced 	by new 	ones and their form 	and contents should be 	decided on 	in consultation with 	the Indian community.  Instead 	of the 	two documents, a 	permit and 	a registration 	[certificate] that 	are taken out 	at present, 	only one should 	be issued 	to Indians.  Permits 	should also be 	issued to 	boys and girls who have 	come of age.  No 	Indian should 	get a trade 	licence if he does 	 not produce 	his permit.  The 	children of 	lawful Indian residents 	should also receive 	permits.  Temporary 	permits should be 	issued only 	after a 	surety approved 	by the 	Colonial Secretary is produced. 
 These proposals, if accepted, would solve all problems. It is undoubtedly true that the observance of some of the provisions will depend on the goodwill of the Indian community; for example, not getting a trade licence without first having a permit. But in  such matters we ask the Government to trust us. Again this [state of affairs] will not last long, for the whole problem will have to  be  solved quickly. Moreover, these problems are not covered by the registration law; other laws will be required to solve them.
 APPEAL
 In your name, I appeal to the Government to accept our proposals. That will end their conflict with the Imperial Government. We do not want to be always complaining to the Imperial Govern- ment. We want to live honourably in goodwill and amity with the whites under the aegis of the local Government and thus to respect
 
 the wishes of the whites. But all that can be done only if they regard us as human beings, grant that we have the same feelings that they have; that we are fit to enjoy the same rights as they under the great British Empire. But if, unfortunately, this meeting cannot convince the Government of this unpalatable truth and of the justice of our demands, we shall have no alternative but to ask for the protection of the Imperial Govern-ment, which it is bound to give. Whenever the weak are oppressed by the strong, it is the duty of the Imperial Government to come to their help. I draw the attention of this meeting to the resolutions passed by the [executive] Committee of the Association. I thank you all for having attended this meeting. May God help us. May He give the officials the good sense to realize that our petition is just and to grant it in the belief that we have no strength save our truthfulness. May they, at the beginning of their rule, give us hopes for the future! (Applause.)
 The speech was read by Mr. Nanalal Shah in English. Mr. Ally then moved the first resolution.
 FIRST RESOLUTION
 This meeting convened by the British Indian Association respectfully protests against the Asiatic Law Amendment Bill as being unnecessary and degrading to the Indian community.
 [HAJI] OJER ALLY
 I am happy to move this resolution. I was a member of the Deputation that went to England. The labours of the Deputation have been reduced to nought. No one can say that we are not loyal subjects. Though a law-abiding people, we are oppressed. We have not assembled here to defend those who enter with faked permits or with none. Let the Government drive them out if they want to, but it is unjust to punish the genuine permit- holders for theof Fences of the others. It has been stated in the new parliament that the existing law is not enough to expel the offending Indians. But that is not true. Let the Government, if they like, enact a law that no one without a permit can carry on trade or hawking or take up employment. If this is done, how can any Indian live on in the Transvaal without a permit? When the Deputation was in England, a petition was sent [from here] to say that the members of the Deputation did not represent the community as a whole. There are Indians of all communities in
 this meeting. Delegates from all the towns are here. If there is anyone here who is opposed to that Deputation, let him speak up. Lord Selborne’s tirade against us is undeserved. It is really strange that the Bill which Lord Elgin had rejected should be re- introduced. The President has pointed out that the Bill  was passed within 24 hours; but I say that it was passed within an hour and a half. Would the British people lose their sense  justice? If so, let the Proclamation of Queen [Victoria] and King Edward’s message be withdrawn. If this Bill is passed,we shall be looked upon as criminals by the whole world. It is shameful that Mr. Smuts should call us coolies. When I was in England, I was made a member of the National Liberal Club. Even the lords respected me. If this Bill is passed, I will not stay in this land a moment longer. Rather than pass such laws, the Government had better drive us out of the Colony.
 ESSOP MIAN
 I support the resolution moved by Mr. Ally. It is pleasing to find that we can get together at a critical time [like this]. I believe Lord Selborne has been ill-disposed towards us from the outset. He has always regarded us all as coolies and no better than locusts. They fought the Boers on our behalf but have now handed the country back to them. And the Boers have re-enacted the law Will Lord Elgin now sign the same Bill which he once refused to sign? We have to fight with all our strength. There is goodwill for us in England, and we hope to obtain redress for our grievances there. Let Mr. Chamney put his thumb-impression on our permits if he likes. Who will then be able to erase those thumb-marks? [sic] The fact that the Government does not even forward our telegram shows that we are not going to get justice here. We can never accept such a law.
 COOVADIA
 I also support Mr. Ally’s resolution. It is our duty to put up a struggle. The Ordinance is obnoxious and I appeal to everyone to refuse to submit to it.
 HAJI HABIB
 I support this resolution. Lord Selborne is sorry that the Ordinance was not approved by the Imperial Government for he believes that, without it, he will not be able to fulfil the
 
 promise he made to a handful of whites. But does he not regret not having made good his promise to the Indian community before the war? Which is more important—his promise given to a handful of whites or the one given to the thirty crores of Indians? Again? Whose words are more important—those of Lord Selborne or those of the late Queen Victoria and King- Emperor Edward? The whites say that this country belongs exclusively to them. Let us think this over. There are [in the Colony] nearly a hundred  thousand Indians,libtech_407_footnotefive  million Kaffirs and the rest Malays and Gape Boys. Only when these people are all banished from the country can this be called a white man’s land. Let them send the Kaffirs away to Abyssinia, the Indians to India, the Chinese to China, the Malays to their native land and the Cape Boys to St. Helena. Then, certainly, this will become the land of the whites. Then we shall see how the affairs of the country are managed. We shall always need three things to put up a fight against this law or any other fight for that matter: those who will fight, and the means to fight, that is, money and unity. The first we already have; the second we can procure; the third, unity, we lack. That we must bring about any how.
 JUSAB HAJI VALI
 Are we supposed to be thieves or free-booters that even a Kaffir policeman can accost and detain us wherever we happen to be going? We have begged them [for our rights] for long. We can no longer trust the word of the whites. We will continue to fight by constitutional means. But self-help is necessary. To save the country from degradation, it is necessary for us to educate ourselves.
 RAMSUNDAR PANDIT
 The mother gives her child milk, but a step-mother eats him up. The Government is like a step-mother. The Grand Old Man of India, Dadabhai Naoroji, spent a lifetime in trying to get redress for Indian grievances but that redress has not been obtained. We should follow the example of Japan and unite, become industrious and educate ourselves. 1 think it is better to
 
 Vide “Interview to The Tribune”, 20-10-1906.
 go to gaol than to submit to this law. In England women go to gaol in defence of their rights; how can we men be afraid of doing so? What does it matter if we have to die for our motherland? We should follow the example of great men like Babu Surendranath Banerjea. I think it is better to return to India than to live on here in humiliation.
 Messrs Vaza, Khurshedji, M. V. Naidu and K. N. Dadlani also supported the resolution and it was then passed unanimously.
 SECOND RESOLUTION
 This meeting convened under the auspices of the British Indian Association denies the allegation of illegal influx of Indians on a wholesale scale into the Transvaal, and, in order to satisfy the Govern- ment and the people, offers to submit to voluntary re-registration as was done by the community during Lord Milner’s| time and in the manner indicated in the chairman’s speech thus fulfilling practically all the requirements of the Bill without its offensive character.
 ABDUL REHMAN
 I move this resolution. I do not understand it fully. But I consider myself bound to follow the Association. There is no chance of securing any relief from the Dutch Government. Mr. Smuts has pointed out that the war was fought on our account; this means that we can expect nothing favourable from  the Dutch Government. As to Lord Selborne, why should he do us a good turn?
 Mr. Rees has left our Committeelibtech_408_footnotesaying that Lord Selborne’s despatch is unanswerable. But our chairman  has given a very appropriate reply to it. We do not have even the vote. We have a lot to learn from the Dutch. They are courageous and that is why they have got their kingdom back. Shall we give in? It is better to go to gaol than submit to this law.
 Messrs Ibrahim Gata, M. P. Fancy, S. D. Bobat, Abdul Rehman Moti, Mohanlal Khanderia, T. Naidu and V. Appasami supported the resolution and it was passed unanimously.
 
 
 THIRD RESOLUTION
 In the event of the humble request embodied in the Second Resolution not being accepted by the local Government, this meeting requests full Imperial protection by reason of the fact that the Indian community has no voice in electing the government [of this country] and is a very small and weak community.
 NADIRSHAH CAMA
 I move this resolution. We must understand the nature of this law. It is very humiliating. We wish to live in peace and amity with the whites, but we will not be their slaves. Let those who have entered by fraudulent means be driven out. If all of us hold together, no harm will come to us. We demand no political rights. We have changed our permits several times. We gave thumb-impressions on Lord Milner’s advice. During President Kruger’s lifetime Lord Selborne was our trustee. After the President’s death Lord Selborne has become another Kruger. This law is not meant for the Hottentots or Kaffirs; why then- should it apply only to us? I believe that though my skin is black, my heart is whiter than any white’s. Our Committee is fighting for us in England and our Delegates have returned victorious. We need not, therefore, lose heart. Whatever may happen, we will never accept this law. It will degrade us in the eyes of the whole world. Does Mr. Smuts want to wreak vengeance on us for the war? We have many difficulties to face. Even if the Imperial Government gives its sanction to the law, I will never accept it.
 E. M. ASWAT
 The Act was enacted by the British; and now the Dutch are ruling. But they are not to be blamed. If a dog is hit by a stone, he bites the person who threw the stone at him, not the stone. We shall not eat the Boer Government’s land. It was the locusts which ate up the crop. I will not accept this law.
 GABRU
 This law has a sting like that of a snake. If King-Emperor Edward does not give us justice, darkness will descend everywhere. Why must we be classed with all other Asiatics? Are
 we to be refused even those rights enjoyed by whites who are not British citizens?
 GAURISHANKAR VYAS
 The resolution embodying the appeal is  an  obsequious one. But so let it be. I would remind you all of the resolution we passed last September at the Empire Theatre. That theatre has been gutted by a fire, but the words spoken there live on. If, in accordance with those words, you cannot go to gaol, you may leave the country, but do not accept slavery by taking out passes according to this law. I was present at the Benares Congress. At that time Lala Lajpat Rai described how the Bengalis had acted like lions. We too have to act likewise.
 This resolution was supported by Messrs E. M. Patel, A. Desai, Omerji Sale, Ahmed Mahomed and A. A. Pillay and was passed unanimously.
 FOURTH RESOLUTION
 This meeting authorizes the chairman to submit  these resolutions by cable to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretary of State for India and the Viceroy of India.
 IMAM ABDUL KADIR
 Freedom is the supreme thing; the spread of Islam was made possible by freedom. The British Government fought for the eradication of slavery in Zanzibar. Will that Government now force slavery upon us here? Lord Selborne has accused us of bribery. If the European official had done justice without taking bribes who would have offered him bribes? I shall never accept the imposition of slavery by those who have been sent here as [our] trustees by the Imperial Government.
 OSMAN LATIEF
 For a long time now, we have held meetings about this. We must have courage. We are being blamed for the poverty of the Transvaal whites. But what about the whites in the Orange Rear Colony who go on declaring themselves insolvent? Surely, there are no Indians there. We have got ourselves registered several times over; shall we go on doing so endlessly? The whites admit that, when their forefathers were still barbarians, ours were
 civilized. How then can we, their descendants, bear this law?
 MANIBHAI KHANDUBHAI
 In this world, anything else can be conquered; but the mind of man is unconquerable. Whatever the sufferings we have to undergo, we must oppose this law. As for myself I will never accept it.
 Mr. Bomanshah and Mr. Bapu Desai also supported the resolution, and it was passed unanimously.
 MEANING OF SECOND RESOLUTION
 Mr. Abdul Rehman had said that many people did not understand the Second Resolution; they felt that there was no difference between it and the Bill itself. Replying to this Mr. Gandhi said:
 It is after serious consideration by the leaders, and with their approval, that the Second Resolution is placed before the meeting. Nevertheless, I take upon myself all responsibility for it. I feel that the success of our Deputation to England was due solely to the fact that we had earlier taken out fresh permits and registers on Lord Milner’s advice. If we had obstinately held out at that time, our plight would have become worse. Lord Milner has written a letter to The Times in our favour. That is, I think, because he understood the facts put before him by the Deputation. For our part, just as we demand our rights vigorously and deny accusations against us where they are false, so should we admit our faults when we realize them. Illegal entry by Indians is not as extensive as the whites allege. We must nevertheless confess that some Indians do enter in this manner. The more this happens the more severe will be the restrictions on us.  The Government argue that they cannot exercise an effective check [on illicit immigration] with the existing permits. According to them, the thumb-impressions on some are not clear, and a person sometimes sells his permit at one place and his register at another. This is true to some extent; as a community, however, we do not accept this charge. But the Government do not believe us. It would only be right for us therefore to try to inspire confidence in them. There would therefore be nothing wrong if we agreed to take out permits in the form acceptable to us, without the compulsion of law. We therefore place the proposal before the Government that they give up the idea of
 passing the Act and we voluntarily take out fresh permits. If it is accepted, it will do us credit; the Government will have faith in us; we may even be consulted in future when new legislation is contemplated, and above all the new Bill may be abandoned. Anything voluntarily accepted by us cannot be regarded as humiliation. Another outcome of our proposal will be that our humility, forbearance and good sense will be appreciated in England. To prevent the passage of this Bill, there is, apart of course from gaol-going, no better remedy than this. Moreover, such [a system of] permits will be based on mutual understanding. If therefore at any time we were confronted with any inordinate hardship, we could refuse to act on the understanding.
 If gaol-going—which we have been contemplating—comes after this proposal, it will appear more graceful. The ultimate remedy is, of course, gaol-going. The fact that this time we have not passed any resolution about going to gaol does not mean that, if the Bill is passed, we are not to court imprisonment. No one should put the idea of going to gaol out of his mind.
After a vote of thanks to the chair, the meeting dispersed.

 held on Monday the 8th at about 8.30 p.m. under the chairmanship of Mr. Dawad Mahomed. Many members were present. After the minutes of the last meeting and the accounts, etc., had been passed, a resolu-tion, moved by Mr. Motilal Dewan and seconded by  Mr.  Peeran Mahomed, was passed expressing the sympathy of the Natal Indian Congress for the Transvaal Indians in their campaign against the Asiatic [Registration] Bill and appealing to the Imperial Government to accord adequate protection to the Indian community. The Secretaries were asked to cable the resolution to the Imperial Government.
 OMAR HAJI AMOD ZAVERI’S RESIGNATION
 After this, the resignation of Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri, who intends to go to India, was placed before the Congress for considera- tion. Mr. Gandhi, who was present at the meeting, said that the Cong- ress had no alternative but to accept Mr. Zaveri’s resignation, and added that, though there was no other Indian who could fill the void, the best solution was to appoint Mr. Dada Osman as Joint Secretary.
 Mr. Abdul Kadir was of the opinion that Mr. Zaveri’s resigna- tion should be accepted with effect from the date of his departure and that it would be only right to hold another meeting to consider his resignation and the appointment of another Secretary.
 Mr. Peeran Mahomed also supported Mr. Abdul Kadir’s view and the subject of the resignation and appointment [of a successor] was postponed till the next meeting.
 Mr. Lawrence’s letter suggesting the admission of  young persons [to membership of the Congress] at reduced rates of subscri- ption was then taken up for consideration. After some deliberation, a resolution moved by Mr. Gandhi and seconded by Mr. Abdul Kadir was unanimously passed, appointing a committee consisting of Mr. Dawad Mahomed, the two Secretaries, Mr. Peeran Mahomed, Mr. Abdul Kadir, Mr. Abdul Haji Adam, Mr. Ismail Gora Mahomed and Mr. Gandhi to meet Mr. Lawrence and his friends [in this connect- ion]. The committee was asked to suggest the necessary changes in the rules, regulations and the constitution of the Congress. The meeting then dispersed.
 After the scheduled meeting was over, Mr. Gandhi made a short speech. He pointed out that malaria appeared to have broken out in epidemic form among the Indians on the east coast of Umgeni,libtech_412_footnoteand
 
 
 it was necessary for the community to help them to the utmost. Young men who could spare the time should attend to the poor patients. Dr. Nanji had offered all possible help, and if volunteers came forward to tend the sick, much useful work could be done. It would redound to the fair name of the community and the volunteers would earn the gratitude of poor patients. Even a single individual could do much. The main thing to do was to go to the river bank, find the patients, inquire about their condition and report to the Congress Secretaries and to Dr. Nanji. Many young men had already come forward to do this work with zeal.

330,"April 	9, 1907",LETTER TO “THE NATAL ADVERTISER”libtech_413_footnote,"
            [TO       MARITZBURG,  April 	9, 1907 
  THE 	EDITOR  NATAL 	ADVERTISER  DURBAN]  SIR,  	You, as well as your contemporary The Natal Mercury, have 	commented adversely upon Reuter’s telegram regarding the report of 	the Registrar of Asiatics, published in the Transvaal, on the 	working of the permit system. If the facts as you state were true, 	every word stated by you would be justified, and in order to deserve 	the credit for honesty, which you have been good enough to give me, 	I should undoubtedly have to recall all I have said in public in 	opposition to the allegations as to illegal Asiatic influx into the 	Transvaal on a wholesale basis. Happily for the cause I have the 	privilege of serving, it is not necessary for me to withdraw 	anything I have hitherto said, for the simple reason that Reuter’s 	agency has been instrument all quite unwittingly—in telegraphing 	an utter mis-statement. It will now be difficult to entirely undo 	the mischief created. Reuter’s telegram    
 stated that out of 12,543 registrations only 4,144 were accepted as valid. This is a condensation of a statement in the report which I have before me, and the condensation gives a meaning opposite to the one intended by the writer of the report. Allow me to state the position as briefly as I can. Registration is not to be mixed up with the taking out of permits. In 1903 there were 12,543 Asiatics at least in theTransvaal with lawful authority. Lord Milner some time during the year issued instructions to enforce Law 3 of 1885 and to exact £3 from those Asiatics who had not paid the amount to the late Boer Government, and in order to establish a uniform system of registration, he advised the Indian community to take out new certificates, both for those who had taken out £3 certificates before and those who had not.
 This position the Indian community voluntarily accepted  in order to please His Lordship. What Mr. Chamney says in his report is that out of 12,543 men who presented themselves for registration, 4,144 were able to make good their claim for exemption from payment of £3. How many claimants were rejected is not stated, but the point is perfectly clear that this registration did not affect the validity of the permits already issued. As a matter of fact, registration was granted only in favour of those who were in possession of permits. The statement wired by Reuter, therefore, means that all but 4,144 had to pay the sum of £3 in order to take out registration certificates, which did not in any way replace the permits already issued, so that your inference that 8,000 have managed to enter the Colony illegally is quite wide of the mark. The fact that 144 Asiatics died, and only four of their permits were recovered proves nothing except that the dead men forgot to return their permits in anticipa- tion. There is no law with reference to the return of these documents, and it should be remembered that the men died not in the Transvaal, but in India. The only paragraph, therefore, in the report under discussion, dealing with illegal influx, is that wherein 876 men are alleged to have been found without permits or with stolen permits. Assuming the accuracy of the figures given by Mr. Chamney, all that has been proved is that about fifty stragglers per month entered the Transvaal on false permits or without any. I will not trespass on your courtesy by entering into further discussion beyond stating, without meaning any disparagement to Mr. Chamney, that he, lacking the judicial spirit, has not been able to distinguish between suspicion and proof, and has made statements which do not bear a judicial scrutiny.
 
 They are no more than assertions unsupported by facts, though, as I have already stated, even the one assertion made in support of an illegal influx is capable of being very much boiled down. There is, however, nothing in that report to prove that there has been any encouragement on the part of the Indian community as a whole to an illegal entry nor of illegal influx on a wholesale basis. No one has ever denied the existence altogether of illegal entries, but it is the wholesale basis that has been challenged, and Mr. Chamney’s report, even taken as it is, without considering the natural defects I have drawn attention to, furnishes a complete vindication of the British Indian position. Incidentally, I might mention that your Johannesburg contemporary, The Rand Daily Mail, who had the opportunity of reading the report itself, has come to the conclusion opposite to yours, and it now asks whether, after all, the new Bill is any cure for the evil of illegal entries so far as they have been proved.
 Yours, etc.

 "
331,,CHAMNEY’S REPORT,"
    
 Our Johannesburg correspondent’s summary  of  Mr. Chamney’s Report is well worth the reading. It bears out three things: Mr. Chamney’s hatred of the Indian community, his lack of a sense of justice and the validity of the facts stated by the Indian community.
 Mr. Chamney’s hatred is in evidence in every line he  has written. He has made mountains out of molehills, and has at times made unfounded statements. He says that many people sell old registers for large sums of money but has not been able to adduce any evidence. He has mentioned 876 persons as having entered without permits, but does not indicate how they did it. He does not have the rights of a magistrate and cannot therefore say of a particular person that he has entered unlawfully. He can only express his suspicion of people having entered without permits. However, when he asserts that some persons have come in without permits, it only shows his animus and lack of a sense of justice. Again, he says that the many Indians who were sent back from Durban and others who entered surreptitiously   and   were   arrested   are   not   included   in    the  876
 mentioned earlier. Not one of these facts has any relevance to establishing the number of people who have entered unlawfully. He has brought in these facts only to magnify the issue.
 Despite this exaggerated statement of facts, it is not proved that the Indian community gets many persons to enter without permits or that many persons do in fact enter without them. Even if Mr. Chamney’s figure is correct, it will only mean that 50 percent Indians have entered the Transvaal each month; it will be quite improper to term this an invasion. Again, Mr. Chamney’s Report bears out the Indian community’s statement that the new Bill is absolutely unnecessary. He points out that there is nothing in the existing law to compel a person to give his thumb-impression. This is not true, for the Indian community has never been unwilling to give thumb- impressions. Besides, if anyone refuses, he can be charged  with staying on [in the Colony] without a permit and brought before a court, where he will have to give his thumb-impression. The new Bill, then, is superfluous if it is only for taking a thumb-impression. Now Mr. Chamney also says that the law as it stands is inadequate  to prevent children from entering the Colony. If that were really so, then [how is it that] we do not find any restrictions in the new Bill on the entry of children accompanying their parents[?] This means that the new law does not provide that remedy and that the new  Bill  is therefore altogether useless. Even The Rand Daily Mail now admits this. Taking all this into consideration, we see that Mr. Chamney’s Report cannot at all be taken seriously.

332,,OMAR HAJI AMOD ZAVERI’S RESIGNATION,"
    
 Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri has, owing to some other very important work, resigned his office of Joint Secretary of the Natal Indian Congress. Mr. Omar Zaveri is unique and unrivalled not only in Natal, but in the whole of South Africa. It is, in our view, no exag- geration at all to say that there is no Indian who is his peer. He will be leaving [for India] very shortly. In honouring him we shall be hon- ouring ourselves. The Congress will, of course, felicitate him. But we hope that other bodies also will honour him on their own to show their
 appreciation of his equal regard for all. It is not necessary to hold separate functions. Other bodies besides the Congress can honour him [separately] at the same place and time; and that will only be proper.

333,,TALE OF WOE IN SOUTH AFRICA,"
    
 Many persons have suggested to us that we should publish an account of the hardships we suffer in South Africa. The book should include a translation of petitions, etc., up to date. There is no doubt that such a booklibtech_414_footnote, if published, would be useful and give much food for thought. It may perhaps run to a thousand pages andcannot be brought out at a low price; A copy will cost five shillings. We cannot venture on such a publication unless a sale of 500 copies is assured in advance. We shall be in a position to consider the matter further, if the gentlemen who wish to see the book in print write to us further about it.

 For a long time now, the discussion has gone on  about presenting an address, on behalf of the Indian community, to Mr. Alexander, the retired Police Superintendent. Much time has elapsed since. The longer we take over it the more it reveals our fickleness. We therefore suggest to the leaders of the community that they fulfil without further delay the task undertaken by them.

 Prof. Gokhale is at present on a tour of India; [he is visiting] and making speeches at a number of places on the [political] situation in the country. The principal aim of this tour is to bring
 
 Hindus and Muslims together. Wherever he goes, both the  communities heartily welcome him. They entertain him at dinner parties—a thing which did not happen before. In the course of his tour he visited the Aligarh College, where the students welcomed him with great respect. In a speech on the occasion, he pointed out that, without self-help, we would not be rid of our miseries. He was the guest of Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk of the College. A magnificent banquet was given there in his honour. He also visited Allahabad, Lucknow, Lahore, Amritsar and other places, and through   his speeches he has contributed towards awakening and unifying the people.

 One sees from the table that the value of land held by Indians is only 5 per cent. of the total value of the land in the country. In fact, it is likely that some of this land is mortgaged. The whites’ fears are therefore unwarranted.

 DEPUTATION TO SMUTS
 I wrote last week that a deputation would wait upon Mr. Smuts and place before him the resolution passed at the mass meeting.libtech_418_footnoteMr. Smuts had fixed Thursday the 4th for the interview. Under a special arrangement with the General Manager of the Railways, Messrs Abdul Gani, Coovadia, Essop Mian, Haji Ojer Ally, Moonlight and Gandhi travelled from Johannesburg to Pretoria by the 8.35 express train. At Pretoria they were joined by Messrs Mahomed Haji Joosab and Gaurishankar Vyas. They reached the Colonial Office exactly at 12, where Mr. Chamney was also present.
 Mr. Gandhi narrated all the facts to Mr. Smuts. He reminded Mr. Smuts that the Indian community had itself registered several times. He said that Mr. Chamney’s Report supported the Indian contention and showed in other ways also that the Indians were trust worthy. It was with the help of the Indian community that officials of the Asiatic Office who took bribes had been arrested. Taking al] this into consideration, Mr. Gandhi said, the Government should, on this occasion, agree to the proposal of voluntary registration made in the Second Resolution passed by the mass meeting.
 Then Mr. Haji Ojer Ally advanced further arguments to bear out what Mr. Gandhi had said and drew Mr. Smuts’s attention to the loyalty of the Indian community. Messrs Abdul Gani and Essop
 
 Mian also used other arguments and pointed out the difficulties they had in bringing servants, etc. [from India].
 Mr. Smuts listened to this carefully for more than three quarters of an hour. At the end he said that he had heard several things for the first time, and these he said he would inquire into and send a written replylibtech_419_footnote; but the deputation should not interpret this to mean that the Government would agree to the Second Resolution.
 This reply means that a situation has now arisen which is similar to that which existed when the Deputation waited upon Lord Elgin, and that the Second Resolution might have some effect if a third party could explain the matter to Mr. Smuts. Accordingly, Mr. Polak saw Mr. Gregorowski on Friday, and the latter expressed sympathy. Much appears to depend on Mr. Chamney. If he says that he can, according to the Indian proposal, register people without legislation, Mr. Smuts will very probably accept it. Mr. Polak appears to have done very good work at Pretoria. He spent the whole of Friday meeting people. He saw the editors of the Pretoria News and The Transvaal Advertiser, and also Mr. De Vet. None of them had really understood the facts before, but they have now begun to do so and  have  moreover promised to give all possible help.
 CHAMNEY’S REPORTlibtech_420_footnote
 Mr. Chamney’s Report for the year 1906 has been published. It says that 12,899 permits had been issued to Asiatics till December 31, 1905. The Government’s decision was to issue permits to those Asiatics who had been resident in the Transvaal before the war. It was difficult to ascertain who the old residents of the Transvaal were as the registers maintained before 1899 had been lost. Moreover, as receipts were issued [without names?] to those who paid the £3 tax, it was impossible to determine who had paid the amount [sic]. Many persons used to sell these certificates at high prices. Of the 12,543 permit holders, 4,144 had earlier paid £3 each. On some registers it  was found that something had been over-written in Hindustani  which would suggest that the registers must have originally belonged  to  other persons. In the issue of permits the concurrence of two authorities is at present necessary. The first is that of the Coast Agent
 
 
 posted at Durban who investigates and the other of the Advisory Boards which have been set up at various places and include Europeans. At Johannesburg the investigation is made by the Police Commissioner, and no permit is issued to anyone who fails to produce satisfactory evidence. In all, 598 permits were issued from 1905 to December 1906; 3,286 applications for permits were rejected.  Of these, 1,240 were Indian and 1,238 Chinese. In addition to these, there are many Asiatics in the Transvaal who have entered the Colony without a permit or with permits belonging to others. All these persons cannot be apprehended as they cannot all be forced to give their thumb-impressions. Such persons number 876. Of these, 215 have been prosecuted and sentenced. This figure does not include those who have infiltrated into the territory undetected. Nothing can  be done against them. Nor does this number include the l41 who were turned back from Durban. The greatest difficulty is met with in the case of Asiatic boys. It is not clear from the Supreme Court’s decision for what [categories of] boys a permit is obligatory. Because of this many Indian boys have come in. It was for this reason that the Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance was introduced. According to the 1904 census, there were 1,774 Asiatic boys below the age of 15. It was found that 417 permits had been lost. The following is the classification of Asiatics according to occupations:
 
             JUNE 				1905   JUNE 				1906   INCREASE     General 				Dealers   1,054   1,105   51     Hawkers   3,086   3,587   501     Itinerant 				Traders   46    229   183     Agents   11   8   —     Bakers   6   5   —     Butchers   43    40   —     [Keepers 				of] Eating - houses   63   8   —     Washermen   32    60   28     Grocers   135    131   —     Milkmen   4   3   —     Fruiterers   19    11   —    
 In addition to all this [information] a list of the places where Indian Locations have been established is also given in the Report.
 COMMENTS BY “THE RAND DAILY MAIL”
 The Rand Daily Mail of Johannesburg has strongly criticized the Report. It says that Mr. Chamney has given the reasons for restricting Asiatic immigration; but he has not been able to show that anything more than the existing Act is necessary. Mr. Chamney’s Report conclusively shows that the present procedure has failed. If that is so, that procedure is not likely to change under the new law. There is no reason to believe that any great change will be effected in the matter of taking ten finger-prints instead of the thumb-impression. What is now needed is therefore not a new law but a new procedure. If a new procedure is evolved in consultation with the leaders of the Indian community, it will be very convenient and avoid friction— which at present appears probable—with the Imperial Government. It would have been better if Mr. Chamney had, instead of merely pointing out the existing defects, shown the way for the future.
 
 CABLES TO ENGLAND
 After the Colonial Secretary had refused to forward the cablegram about the Asiatic Bill, the President of the [British Indian] Association inquired of Lord Selborne what was to be done.libtech_421_footnoteThe latter replied that he could not interfere with what the local Government had done. So last Saturday, the Association sent a long cablegramlibtech_422_footnotedirectly to Lord Elgin. A brief cablegramlibtech_423_footnoteregarding the deputation was also sent to the South Africa British Indian Committee. These cablegrams cost £28.
 FOR HAWKERS
 The Chamber of Commerce has suggested the enactment of a special law for hawkers. One of the suggestions is that no hawker should be permitted to stop for business at the same spot for more than 20 minutes, that no hawker should visit a place twice the same day and that hawkers should be allowed to sell their wares on the main thoroughfares only. These suggestions have not yet been accepted. If they are, the plight of the hawkers will become very sad indeed.
 
 
 
 WARNING ABOUT PERMITS
 It came to my knowledge from several sources that  some persons, especially a white among them, have been selling permits to Indians. This is very likely true. Heavy sums are being paid for such permits by some Indians. I must tell them that such permits are of no use whatever. Those buying them would be committing an offence, which would be like paying for bringing trouble upon oneself. It should be easy to see that there will be no duplicates of false permits in the Permit Office and that permits of which no duplicates are available in the Permit Office will be considered faked.
 CLARIFICATION OF MARCH 31 NOTICE
 The Editor has forwarded to me a question raised by a correspondent from Johannesburg. The correspondent inquires whether the holder of a register who fails to get a permit before March 31 will be liable only to being served with a notice asking him to quit the Transvaal or if he will also be punished in some other way. The answer is that a person charged with staying in the Transvaal without a permit, will only get a notice.
 SUGGESTION TO JOHANNESBURG CORRESPONDENTS
 Immediate disposal of letters and other communications will be possible if correspondents in Johannesburg send them to the Johannes burg Office of the Opinion. For some time is wasted in having such papers redirected from Phoenix to Johannesburg. Communications should be addressed to P. O. Box 6522.

341,,DUTY OF TRANSVAAL INDIANS,"
    
 We invite the attention of the Transvaal Indians to a summary of Mr. Tilak’s speech printed elsewhere. On them rests a great responsibility; they have passed a resolution about going to gaol in case the new Bill becomes law. Whether or not we should take an oath or whether or not the September oath still binds us is no longer a question to be decided. The important thing is that we have declared to the world our determination not to submit to the law. It is on this basis that Mr. Ritch is carrying on the struggle. On that basis too, the Deputation went to England, and on that basis several whites have been helping us. The matter is so serious that it has set even Mr. Smuts thinking. It was because the resolution about gaol-going was passed that the Kimberley people as also the Natal Congress have sent telegrams. This is no time for fear. The Transvaal Indians have to adhere steadfastly to the gaol-going Resolution for the sake of their own honour and that of the entire Indian community.
 
 
 Mr. Tilak’s speech applies to us also. Our demand will not be accepted until we force them to do so. The unfailing remedy of gaol going is our [method of] boycottlibtech_431_footnote, our weapon. There can be no question of its failing. For how can there be defeat for one who has gone to gaol?
 Once more we remind the Transvaal Indian community that it is because the Cape Coloureds opposed the Pass Act, refused to take out passes and went to gaol that the Cape Government does  not  any longer compel them to take out passes. Though the Pass Act applies to them, the Government is unable to enforce it. We should under no circumstances prove ourselves more timid than the Coloured persons. All our efforts will be in vain if we do not act up to the assurance which Mr. Ritch has given to Lord Ampthill. If the Indiancommunity remains firm in its resolution about gaol-going, we may as well take it that the new law has not been passed at all.

342,,ENGLAND AND HER COLONIES,"
    
 Nowadays the British welcome ministers from the Colonies. Dr. Jameson who once thought of capturing the land of the Boers is being greeted with loud acclamation. Wherever he and other ministers from the Colonies go, they are profusely honoured. Nobody thinks of their faults; their virtues alone are taken into account.
 All this is as it should be. Only under such conditions can the people rise. The Colonies are like the children of the British. It is nothing surprising if a father meets his children with warmth and enthusiasm, unmindful of their faults and perceptive only of their virtues. Where such a relationship obtains, the family prospers; a people, similarly, thrives on such relationships. This is one of the potent causes of the prosperity of the British. They do not envy the rise of their kith and kin.
 Again the ministers who receive so much honour are brave persons. They are not the sort of persons to be overawed by others and they will take any risks for their country. That is why the British welcome them with acclamation. The Southampton Municipality
 
 presented an address to General Botha soon after he landed there. Though not an Englishman, he possesses the virtues of one and is moreover a brave fighter. He said, “There was a time when during the war I was beleaguered by the British. Today I feel happy to be surrounded by them, yet have no misgivings. Rather, It shall feel the happier if more of you gather round me.” He made this speech in Dutch to show his patriotism.
 Knowing all this as we do, we must not envy them; on the contrary we should congratulate them. And, if we have any public spirit, we should, like them, engage in the work of public welfare and be prepared, like them, even to die for it.

343,,LADYSMITH APPEALS,"
    
 The outcome of the eleven Ladysmith appeals that were preferred to the Supreme Court has confirmed our expectations.Since the licensing courtlibtech_432_footnotegave judgement without taking any evidence, these cases cannot really be called appeals. The Supreme Court has on this ground set aside the judgement of the appellate court and ordered a re-hearing of these cases. The eleven applicants who have been refused licences can appeal again. And if, after taking evidence, the appellate court still refuses obstinately to issue a licence, there is nothing the applicants can do.
 It is a bad thing that in this case the court has not allowed costs to the appellants, as it did in the Somnath Maharaj case. If costs had been allowed, the appellate court would have been a little more careful. We cannot regard the [result of the] appeals as a complete victory. The Licensing Act remains what it has always been. But since we did not expect any sensational result, there is no cause for despair. The Natal Indian Congress must persevere with the struggle. If adequate efforts are made, the licensing act will be repealed.

344,,CHANGES IN EGYPT,"
    
 Lord Cromer has relinquished the post of British Comptroller General in Egypt, mentioning his ill-health as the reason. He introdu- ced many reforms in Egypt. He gave the Egyptian people education, thus awakening in them a national consciousness. Now the same Egyptians have risen against Lord Cromer, because he wants to dis- pose of unlimited powers. Sir Eldon Gorst has been appointed in his place. It is said that Sir Eldon will adhere to the policy of Lord Cro- mer. However, the Liberal Press in England recognizes and desiresthat more power should be granted to the Egyptian people. The Egyptian Press also hopes that the change in the office will result in the devol- ution of more power to the people. In any case, it is clear that the me- mbers of the Liberal Party today desire that people all over the British Empire should enjoy a greater share of power [in government].

345,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 COLONIAL SECRETARY’S REPLY
 I have already reported on the deputation.libtech_433_footnoteThe following is the replylibtech_434_footnotereceived from Mr. Smuts.
  I 	am obliged 	to the 	Indian community 	for your 	letter of the 	30th and for the 	representation made 	to me during 	the Indian deputation’s interview 	with me 	on the Asiatic 	Registration Act and 	other subjects. 	Objecting to the 	new Act the deputation 	said that it 	would only serve to 	harass the 	Indian community, that 	it was 	unneces- sary 	in view 	of the 	community’s 	willingness to take 	out new registers 	voluntarily, and 	that it 	was humiliating 	because it made 	registration compulsory. 	The deputation 	also pointed 	out that 	the [Indian] grievance 	regarding land rights 	under Law[3] of 1885was 	not being redressed, and that the difficulties experienced by those coming to 
 
 the Colony for a temporary stay should be remedied.
  All 	this has been carefully 	considered and I 	have to 	point out 	that Section 17 	of the new Act provides 	for the issue 	of a 	temporary permit.  As 	for land 	rights, I 	regret to 	say that 	the Government 	can grant no 	more relief than the 	specific reference in 	Section 21 	to the land 	belonging to 	a particular person.libtech_435_footnote  As 	for the other 	grounds on 	which objections 	have been 	raised against the 	Act, I have to assure you 	that the Government 	 intends no 	insult to 	the Asiatic community. 	At the same 	time, it cannot 	be deniedthat 	the question 	of marks 	which will make the 	identification of 	Asiatic people 	possible is 	full of 	difficulties. The 	main aim 	of the 	new Act is to adopt such means as will make it easy to identify 	persons of that 	community with 	a view 	to ascertaining 	who are entitled to 	reside here. The 	new Act is necessary to 	achieve this object. I 	regret to 	have to 	say that the suggestion 	made by 	the deputation 	about fresh 	registrationcannot be 	accepted. For 	doing so 	a proviso 	for compul- 	sory registration 	is necessary. 	Moreover, I cannot 	see how you could 	say with 	certainty that 	your word would be 	binding on 	other Asiatic 	communities, and 	particularly on 	those residing without a permit.  There 	is no doubt 	that many whites hold 	that a number 	of Asiatics 	is infiltrating 	into this territory without permits. And 	they also 	find that people 	have been doing so 	because there 	is no adequate 	law in 	force to 	identify the 	[lawfully resident] 	Asiatics. It is not 	possible for 	the Government to 	ignore this 	feeling. Moreover, the 	Government has 	strong evidence of 	such unlawful 	infiltration. 	Considering this 	matter, I 	am sorry 	to find 	that, in your 	meeting and 	speeches, people have been advised to 	disobey the 	law by not registering 	themselves. In your 	own interests, I 	expect you 	will not advocate a 	course of 	action that will make it 	impossible for 	us to grant special 	concessions to your 	community. I 	sincerely hope 	therefore that 	your community, which 	has always 	had the privilege 	of being 	considered law-abiding, 	will maintain 	its reputation 	in the 	matter and 	that Indians 	will co-operate with 	the Government 	in every 	way by 	registering themselves 	lawfully, gracefully 	and expeditiously. 	The Act has been 	framed in the 
 
 
 interests of both the Asiatics and the whites. If the Act were regarded as not binding, greater pressure would be brought on the Government as well as parliament to take more stringent measures to prevent Asiatics from entering without a permit.
 REFLECTIONS ON REPLY
 The reply is at once good and bad, timorous and threatening. I call it good because it is courteous. If the Government wanted to disregard the Indian community altogether, they could have disposed of the matter with a two-line reply, without giving reasons. The reason why I call it bad is that Mr. Smuts hesitates to accept even our most reasonable demands. It is timorous, because of the ideas [of Indians], [their] resolutions and speeches on the subject of gaol-going, the Government is afraid that the Indian community may [actually]  display such strength, for then the Act may be proved ineffective. It is threatening, because the Government, being frightened as we have shown above, hold out the threat that, if we do not accept the law, more stringent measures will follow; they hope that they can avoid a difficult situation if, under the threat of severe consequences, we can be made to give up the idea of going to gaol.
 Now what is to be done? The present is a crucial moment. If we are imbued with the right spirit and care for our honour, we shall win. We should certainly not be cowed down by the Government’s threat, for what greater pain can they inflict on us than the law they have already passed? What greater harm can be done to a man than to divest him of his honour? On the one hand, we are being persuaded to help in enforcing the law and, on the other, they pass an act which proclaims that, in the whole Indian community, there is not a single person trustworthy enough  to be exempted from holding a  registration certificate, that is, a “thief pass”. We are first made out to be thieves and our help is then sought in enforcing the law!
 Nowhere is it stated [in Mr. Smuts’s reply] that even a single right will be granted to us. The land right has been flatly denied. Locations still loom before our eyes. What further humiliation can be inflicted on those who have been degraded to the lowest depths? In the present age and according to European standards, there can be no love without fear. We have the example of Mr. Smuts’s own people with whom the British Government argued in a similar fashion. They told President Kruger that it would be better to concede certain rights
 to the British, else the Dutch would have to suffer. President Kruger paid no heed to such bland words. Nor was he afraid of the threat. He himself remained courageous and inspired bravery in his people, and thus immortalized them and himself. As a result, the people have today regained what was once theirs. Many Dutchmen died on the battle-field; their women and children were ruined. But the survivors rule today. Thus those who lost their lives are not dead, but have become immortal. We shall win only if we do the same, but somewhat differently. All the assurances that Mr. Smuts or others may offer are to he shunned like sugar-coated pills of poison. If we turn back now, we may be sure that we shall for ever remain entrapped.  It  was thoughts such as these that impelled the meeting of the Association on Thursday the 11th to send Mr. Smuts a letter over the signature of its Acting Chairman, Mr. Essop Mian. It is politely worded, but upholds our honour. A translation of it is given below:
 ASSOCIATION’S REPLY
 I have received your letter of the 8th instant about the suggestion of the Indian community regarding the Asiatic Bill. My Association is very grateful to the Government for its deta- iled and sympathetic reply. However, I approach them with a request to reconsider the matter in the light of the following. The objections raised by the Indian community are so impor tant, and the suggestion it has made so just and proper that my Association finds it necessary to persuade the Government to accept it.
 May I take the liberty of reminding you that, under Lord Milner’s advice, the Indian community had agreed to registra- tion on the same lines as now proposed, and that the Chinese community had also accepted it? My Association would humbly state that there is no need to make a promise, as the proposal is such that it could be immediately implemented. Moreover, it can be ascertained, without loss of time, how many Asiatics are agreeable to taking out the new registers in place of their pre- sent permits.
 Your Honour’s letter raises the question of permitless persons. But that question does not arise from our suggestion or from the new Act. For in neither case will such men be able to obtain permits. When fresh registration is completed, it will
 remain only to detect those without permits, and to serve them with ‘quit’ notices for unlawful residence in the Colony.
 My Association admits that European residents are excited about many Indians entering the Colony without permits and it is for that very reason that my community has made the forego ing suggestion which provides for adequate means of our identi- fication. And when the existing documents are withdrawn [after the issue of new registers,] there will be no difficulty about identification. However, I must say that, whatever the means for establishing identity, those bent on entering surreptitiously will continue todo so anyhow. I must also add that not many persons enter in this manner and that Mr. Chamney’s Report is enough proof of it.
 My Association therefore prays that the Government reconsider the matter, and hopes that, after doing so, they will come to entertain a better opinion of the Indian community’s proposal.
 You refer to the Resolutions about defying the law. We must point out in reply that there can be no question of defying the law at all. However, if, for any reason, Indians’ respect for the law is put to a severe strain and if in that context the community seeks to vindicate its honour and prestige, the only way open to it will be to submit to the ultimate penalty  prescribed by law, that is, to go to gaol. Such action cannot be construed as a desire on the part of the Indian community to disobey the law. However, the community desires humbly to point out that the new law gravely offends against its feelings. It implies that the Indian community wishes to defeat the objects of the law. On the contrary, through  this suggestion, the community [seeks to] fulfil the intention of the law. My Association therefore humbly requests that the Indian proposal be given a trial before the law is enforced. It makes this suggestion in the conviction that all Asiatic communities will act according to it.
 CONSEQUENCE OF REPLY
 It cannot be predicted how the Government will react to this reply. But it is certain that it will set the Government thinking. They have themselves raised the question of gaol-going. If we retract now,
 
 that will only serve to show up the abjectness of the community. The reply has in it neither bitterness nor threat. It is polite but firm, and reflects the courageous mood of the community.
 CHINESE MOVE
 The Chinese leaders met last Saturday at Mr. Gandhi’s office and resolved to support the Indian community. The Chinese Consul has also given them similar advice. It is thus seen that we get support from all quarters.
 ASIATIC EATING-HOUSES
 Notwithstanding the Association’s struggle against the regulat- ions concerning Asiatic eating-houses, they have been passed and already published in the Government Gazette. Those who run eating- houses therefore must take out licences. It should be remembered that, if their kitchens and dining-rooms are not found absolutely clean, they will not be issued a licence.
 RUMOUR OF ASSENT TO NEW LAW
 A rumour was going the rounds here that Lord Elgin had approved the new law. On an enquiry by the Association it was learnt that no such thing had happened and that the rumour was unfounded.
 WARNING
 Great caution is necessary in this matter. In spite of the tremendous efforts being made, Lord Elgin may after all append his signature to the law. It is desirable therefore that those engaged in trade should take out a shopkeeper’s or hawker’s licence for the whole year. If they do that, their trade will not be affected at least this year even if the law should come into force. If in the meanwhile gaol- going is resorted to, the law cannot but be repealed ultimately.
 CHINESE APPROVAL
 The Chinese have sent a telegram to the Government saying that they are opposed to the law and that they approve of the Indian community’s proposal.libtech_436_footnote
 COMMENT BY “THE RAND DAILY MAIL”
 On this, The Rand Daily Mail has made a good comment. It says that now that the Chinese have endorsed the Indian proposal, all
 
 Asiatic communities can be said to have turned against the Act. It behoved the Government, therefore, to accept the Indian proposal. It was legitimate for the Indian community to object to the law, and its feelings should not be hurt.
 REJOINDER TO CHAMNEY
 The Rand Daily Mail has published a long rejoinder by the English editor of this paper to Mr. Reportlibtech_437_footnote. It has been printed in the column next to the leader. It will be published in two instalments.
 OSMAN LATIEF’S LETTER
 Mr. Oman under the pen-name of “British Indian”, has written a letter to the local Press, in which he has pointed out that the Indian community has taken out registers several times, that the objection based on competition in trade is untenable, and that justice must be done to the Indian community, keeping in view Queen Victoria’s assurances and those of others and the community’s own readiness to share in the defence of the British Empire.
 CABLE TO COMMITTEE
 A cable has been sent to the South Africa British Indian Committee communicating the Chinese approval [of the Indian proposal] and the support of The [Rand] Daily Mail, and inquiring about the state of the movement in England.

346,"April 20, 1907",346. LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL GANDHI,"
 JOHANNESBURG,
 April 20, 1907
 
MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL
 With reference to the £10 withdrawn by Harilal from your father at Rajkot, I am crediting the Press with £10 and debiting my private account, and, I take it, you will withdraw the £10 from the Press, unless you have done so already.
With reference to the entry of £4 re. Kaliandas, the book here
 
 
 seems to be in order. When the month was finished, £3 was debited to the Press and credited to Kaliandas, £4 debited to the Office and credited to Kaliandas. Evidently, it should have been £4 against the Press and £3 against the Office, which will now be done. Further, what has to be done here is to pass a debit against the Press of £1. These entries will be correct, if, at the time, you did not make any entries there, that is to say, if you did not credit Kaliandas independently of entries sent from here. If you did, you will now have to make cross- entries. I assume also that no moneys passed from you to Kaliandas, because, in my ledger £7 has been credited to him.
 I have now received the household account. They seem to have spent money lavishly, and, yet, there is very little in detail I can take exception to. I notice also that the piano has not yet been debited to me, unless I have overlooked it in going through it hurriedly, so that the amount will be increased by another £10. Is that so?
 I am intensely dissatisfied with Gokaldas’ betrothal, for I understand that he has actually paid Rs. 2,000 in order to bring about the betrothal. I do not know whether I have understood the thing correctly. If it is in respect of jewellery, the matter is not so open to criticism. I have meagre details about it. If you know  anything  definite, I should like to know what has actually happened.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI
[PS.]
 I am sending you 3 numbers of The Times of India. After you
 have seen and admired pictures I want you to cut out Gaekwar, the Jam, and the Cricket Team. We might one of these days want to reproduce these pictures as supplements, and it would be better for you also to file any other pictures you may come across and consider good enough for use.

347,"April 20, 1907",347. LETTER TO LAKSHMIDAS GANDHI,"
 [About April 20, 1907]libtech_438_footnote
 
RESPECTED SIR,
 I have received your letter. I wish to answer it with the utmost calmness and as fully as possible. I shall first put my thoughts before you as they come to my mind, and then answer your questions.
 I am afraid our outlooks differ widely and I see no possibility, for the present, of their being reconciled. You seek peace and happiness through money. I don’t depend on money for my peace; and for the moment at any rate my mind is quite calm and able to stand any amount of suffering.
 Like you, I too believe in the old traditions, but there is a difference in our beliefs. For you believe in age-old superstitions, while I not only do not but consider it sinful to believe in them.
 You desire to attain mokshalibtech_439_footnote, so do I. Nevertheless, your notion of that state seems to be widely different from mine. Though I have the highest regard for you, untainted by any mean or selfish thought, you harbour hatred for me in your mind. The reason for this, as I see it, is that you are overcome by attachment and maintain relationships for selfish ends. Though you do this unconsciously, the result is practically the same as I have indicated. If you have really got to the stage ofstriving for moksha, you should remain calm and unperturbed and forget all about me, even if I am extremely sinful and may be deceiving you. But you are not able to do so because of  your excessive attachment. This is what I believe; but if I am wrong in holding this belief, I prostrate myself at your feet and beg to be forgiven.
 But whether or not you are overcome by greed and attachment, I am not worried. It does not affect my love for you. My regard for you does not decrease in the least, and I am ready to render you any service that I can and look upon it as my duty.
I fail to understand what you mean by the word “family”. To
 
 me, the family includes not only the two brothers but the sister as well. It also includes our cousins. Indeed, if I could say so without  arrogance, I would say that my family comprises all living beings: the only difference being that those who are more dependent on me, because of blood relationship or other circumstances, get more help from me. Hence it was that I took out an insurance policy in my wife’s favour. And this I did because of your bitter letters to me when  I was in Bombay and in order to escape your imprecations in case the responsibility for [supporting] my wife and children fell on you, as I was at that time engaged in helping the plague-stricken. Though I am myself against insurance, I took out an insurance policy for these and other reasons. If by any chance you die before me, you may be sure that I shall myself [serve as] an insurance policy for your wife and children. I beseech you to feel secure on this account. I would cite the case of Raliatbehn in this context.
 If Raliatbehn does not stay with you, I do not consider that to be due to any fault of mine, but hold your nature responsible. I would humbly remind you that mother was not happy with you, nor at any time were any of the other relatives.
 If Gokuldas and Harilal have gone astray, I am not responsible. Gokuldas left me and was spoiled by the pernicious atmosphere there; the same thing happened with Harilal to some extent. Nevertheless, neither of them has become as corrupt as you think. They have better character than other boys. It is only when I judge them by a standard of my own that I find them lacking. Harilal has greatly profited by coming here and, if I mistake not, his character has improved. Since Harilal is already betrothed, I have nothing to say against it. At the same time I cannot say that I am pleased about it.
 I consider it wrong too that Gokuldas is going to get married. That it has become necessary for the two brothers to get-married is due to the sensual atmosphere there. It is not any dislike for the country but the grief I feel for its present sorry plight that prompts me to say this.
 Fortunately, Maniolibtech_440_footnote, Ramolibtech_441_footnoteand Devolibtech_442_footnoteare here, and are growing up in a healthy atmosphere. I do not therefore worry about their betrothal. To my way of thinking, it is necessary for many Indians to
 
 observe brahmacharya, even if they get married. If, therefore, all the three boys were to die unmarried, I shouldn’t be sorry but should rejoice instead. However, if when they come of age they wish  to marry, I am sure that they will find suitable brides. It would cause you great sorrow if I were to give my answer to the question, “What is to be done if no girl is to be had from our caste?”; so I would, with your permission, rather not answer this question. I repeat that it is the divine law that one gets fruits according to one’s faith and therefore this problem does not arise in my mind at all.
 Chhaganlal, Maganlal and Anandlal are members of our family, hence service done to them is service done to the family. They have become better men after coming to Phoenix and I see their moral sense developed.
 As to your demand for a hundred rupees a month, I must say that I see neither the means at present nor the need of meeting it. I run the Phoenix Press with borrowed money. Moreover, I may have to go to gaol in the course of the struggle here against the new Ordinance. In that case I may become poorer still. This will come about in a month or two. I am therefore unable at present to do anything to satisfy you. If, however, the condition here improves during the next few months and I am free from trouble, I shall try to send you the money you have asked for by money order with the sole intention of pleasing you.
 I do agree that you and Karsandas have [the right to] a share in my earnings. But I spend much less on my personal enjoyment than you do [on yours]. My earnings are what remains after meeting all the charges here. My object in staying here was not to make money but to serve the people; hence I deem it my duty to use for the benefit of the people whatever is left over after meeting the expen-diture on the family here. So please don’t think that I am making money here. At this point I would remind you that between you two brothers I have already paid nearly Rs. 60,000. I cleared all the debts while I was there; and you told me that no more money was wanted. It was only after this that I began spending money here. I handed over all my savings in Natal to you; and I have not kept a penny for myself either from that amount or from my subsequent earnings. From this you will see that I have paid back much more than the Rs. 13,000 spent on me during my stay in England. In saying this I do not mean to suggest
 that I have done you a favour. I only state the bare facts to pacify your anger.
 What Mr. Fitzgerald told you about me only shows that he does not know the facts.
I shall now answer your questions libtech_443_footnote. These I return herewith.
  The 	object of 	sending me 	to England was 	that we, 	all the three of 	us, might 	thereby maintain the 	status of 	our father 	more or 	less, be 	well off 	and enjoy the 	good things of life.  The 	risk was 	indeed great as 	we had decided to 	stake whatever 	we had 	on my education.  As 	those who 	had promised to 	help us 	did not keep 	their word, 	you worked 	hard, and even 	at the 	cost of 	your health, ungrudgi- 	ngly gave me as much 	money as I 	asked for. This shows 	your magn- animity and 	your affection for 	a younger brother.  When 	we were 	reduced to the condition 	described in 	this question, I 	did feel—I 	vaguely recollect—that I 	would earn enough to 	satisfy you. and make 	you forget the 	hardships you 	underwent for 	my sake.  This 	I do 	not recollect, 	as father 	himself had started 	selling the 	property and 	we did 	the same after him. This 	is but natural.  I 	must say with deep 	sorrow that, on 	account of your 	extravagant and 	thoughtless way 	of life, 	you have squandered 	a lot 	of money 	on pleasures 	and on 	pomp and 	show. You 	kept a 	horse and 	carriage, gave 	parties, and 	spent money on 	selfish friends; and 	some money was 	spent in 	what I 	consider immoral ways.  I 	remember to 	have sold them. I 	am not 	at all 	ashamed of 	it, neither 	do I regret it.  I 	do not 	remember to 	have sold them secretly 	without your knowledge; even if I had done so, I do not mind it.  Though 	I did 	not replace that 	jewellery, I 	have already 	paid its 	value in 	cash and 	much more besides. 	However, if I am 	required to 	do so [again], 	I shall 	certainly deposit the 	money in their 	names, that 	is, if 	I am able to 	save any. As 	for getting 	the jewellery 	made afresh, I will not do so, as I consider it a sin. When I refuse to get the jewellery 
 
 made, it means that my ideas about such things have substantially changed.
  I 	do not 	consider that 	I have 	obliged you 	by doing 	this. Even if 	nothing was 	done for 	me, whatever I 	have to 	do for my 	blood- brother 	I would 	do as a 	matter of 	duty. If 	then I 	do anything 	for one 	who spent 	a great 	deal on 	my account, it 	would be 	doubly my 	duty to 	do so.  I 	am not 	the master of 	my earnings, since 	I have 	dedicated my 	all to 	the people. 	I do 	not suffer 	from the illusion 	that it 	is I who 	earn; I 	simply believe that 	God gives me the 	money for making good 	use of it.  I 	do recognize 	your [right 	to a] share 	in all 	my earnings; 	but since there is 	no such thing as 	an income for 	me now, 	what can I send you?  I 	am not 	spending your 	share [on myself]; 	but I 	use all the 	money that 	God gives me 	for the public 	good. If anything 	is left 	over after 	what has been used for 	this purpose, I 	would like 	to send 	you all of 	it, not just your share 	of it.  I 	don’t have the 	faintest recollection of 	having robbed you 	or anyone 	else. If I 	regard all 	living beings as 	equal both 	from the practical 	and the moral 	points of view, 	it is in the 	fitness of 	things that 	those who 	are more dependent 	on me have 	a greater 	claim on 	me. That 	is to say, 	I should 	help my wife 	and sons 	first and then 	those who are 	helpless and 	have therefore 	a claim 	on me. 	If, on the 	other hand, 	my wife 	and sons 	find their means of 	living independently of 	me, they 	may be left 	alone and others 	who are helpless 	anddepend on me will 	have precedence. 	This means 	that Gokolibtech_444_footnote, 	if he were  not 	 earning, would have a 	prior claim to 	Hariyo’slibtech_445_footnoteif the 	latter were earning. 	If all 	of them 	are earning 	and you are not, 	yours will be the 	first claim. 	Moreover, if 	all of 	you were working, 	but Purshottam 	was not and he 	were still with us, his 	would be the first claim. This claim pertains only to 	maintenance and 	not to the 	illusory worldly 	pleasures. Whatever 	other questions of 	a subsidiary 	nature arise out of 	the above, 	you will 	be able 	to answer 	for yourself. 	All this is 	written without 	any bad 	motive whatever. The answer to this question is contained in the previous one. 
 
  I 	have no 	objection whatever to 	your showing 	this letter or 	any portion 	of it to anyone 	you like. I 	do not 	know who should judge 	as between 	us. I 	am at your 	command. I 	am in no way 	your equal and 	no one therefore can 	compare us 	and pronounce 	 judgement. However, 	I shall 	hear what those to whom 	you show 	this letter have to say 	and shall reply to 	them according to 	my lights. 
 I revere you as you are my elder brother. Our religion bids us treat our elders with veneration. I implicitly believe in that injunction. But I have greater regard for truth. This too is taught by our religion. If you find anything objectionable in what I say, please accept my assurance that I have answered all your questions with the greatest regard for truth, and not in order to hurt you or be rude. Formerly, there was no difference of opinion or misunderstanding between us, hence you had affection for me. Now you have turned away from me because my views have changed, as I have said. Since you consider this change has been for the worse, I can quite understand that some of my answers will not be acceptable to you. But as the change in my ideas is due to my pursuit of truth, I am quite helpless. My devotion to you remains the same as before; it has simply assumed a new form. All this I shall explain to you most humbly and at length some day when we meet and if you want me to tell you about it. But I am unable to say when I can leave this country because of the peculiar circumstances and my several obligations here.

CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 In her letter received here today your aunt writes that your wife has had another son and that both mother and child are well. I should like to know, if possible, how much each of your two sons weighs. I would particularly advise you to see that the child’s bed and other linen are quite clean. Do not allow the useless and wicked superstitions about untouchability to come in your way. Use a cradle in preference to a hammock. I would like your son to be as healthy as Mrs. Polak’s.
 Please ask Thakkar to translate the speech read  by  Mr. Fitzgerald on the occasion of Ranjit Singh’s accession to the gadi and the latter’s reply which are [both] reported in The Times of India. Please reproduce these in English also if possible. Both are good. There is an article about us in one of the issues of that paper; please get a cutting and send it to me. I forgot to take one myself.
 Please let me know how you are faring there. How do you feel in your mind? How do you find yourself in relation to West? What do you think about your going [to England]?
     [PS.]  Blessings 	from  MOHANDAS   I am 	sending some Gujarati matter today. There must be some

 MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,
 I have your letter. With reference to the Madressa, it is not possible for us to give any independent opinion. How can we? All we can do is to bring out the best points in the report, which I have done.  I have given a note on Al Islamlibtech_452_footnotealso.
 I suppose Apoo has asked for the money for the firm. I have not said anything . . .libtech_453_footnotebecause I wanted you to use your discretion.
 I have telegraphed today saying that Kalyandas must prepare to leave immediately. I have a peremptory letter from his father. He should, therefore, go. You will perhaps read my letter to Mr. West, wherein I have suggested that Maganlal should replace Kalyandas. I am likely to be there before he leaves. All that I have said before regarding him is applicable today also.
 I have received all the cuttings mentioned by you. I am sending under cover to you the Jaina. I want Harilal to read it and make
 
 selections, but I recommend it for your perusal also. It seems to me that it is a very ably edited paper. I have been receiving it regularly for the last twelve months, and each cursory glance through [it] made me think the more highly of it. You will see the manner in which news are condensed and given in its columns. I think that the language also is very good. I used to send it to the Indian Public Library directly, but, this time, there are so many things of importance in it that I send it for Indian Opinion use first, and then, if it is not cut about, you can send it to the library. Directions about taking some portions of it are given in my letter to Harilal.
 Do you want me to write to D. Ebrahim Ismail regarding the fifty copies? For the present, as I have already suggested, even at the risk of having a few copies left unsold, it will be better to print extra copies, because one never knows when there will be a good demand, which we ought to be in a position to meet.
 I have already suggested to you that you should read the Islam Gazette carefully, so that we may not duplicate the information. I remind you again, because I put that paper, also, in [as] fairly edited, though for condensation and choice of matter, it cannot stand comparison with the Jaina.

351,,COLONIAL CONFERENCE AND INDIANS,"
         	Lord Milner has written an article about the Colonial Confer- ence 	from which we publish elsewhere an extract relating to Indians. It 	is clear from this that there is commotion everywhere over the 	hardships of Indians in South Africa. To Lord Milner’s way of 	thinking, India is more valuable than the Colonies, and if ever a        
 question arose as to whether the British should lose the Colonies or India, they would decide to give up the Colonies rather than India. But it is in our hands to decide when such an eventuality should arise. If we could rid ourselves of all our shortcomings, then such a situation can be said already to exist. So long as the officials can persuade [the British people] that we shall put up with any amount of suffering, they will believe in the Colonies and the burden on the Indian people will increase. This is the way of the world. The rich grow richer, the poor poorer. The burden on those who carry it increases and those who do not carry any go unscathed. The moral is that we have to let the Government know that we in the Colony will not stand any more burden.
 Lord Milner also adds that India is vital to the entire English nation as well as the Colonies. Its value is immeasurable. Why should it not be so? Her revenues total £44 million (a million = 10 lakhs). Out of this £22 million are spent on the military depart-ment, that is, a major portion of this amount is spent in paying the salaries of the British soldiers and buying British goods. A third part of the £44 million, that is, about£15 million goes straight to England. Only the balance remains in India. This means that in the partnership between the British and the Indians 83 per cent. of the profit goes to the British and 17 per cent. to the Indians, but the entire capital comes from the Indians. Such a partnership is evidently advantageous to the British. Let us now turn to the Colonies. Here, all the capital is provided by the British but the profit is consumed by the Colonies. If anyone asks the reason of this one-sided justice, the only reply is that the Colonies being strong have the lion’s share. They can stand up to England. If we become as strong as they, we too shall get justice. A closed mouth catches no flies; that is the policy of the British. But speaking does not mean mere shouting. It must be accompanied by kicking. The way we can kick in South Africa or in India is to go to gaol. If we do not help in the oppression that is being perpetrated on us, we shall be free. It is only when the axe is fitted with a wooden handle that it can cut wood.

352,,MALARIA AROUND DURBANlibtech_457_footnote,"
    
 Malaria is still raging among Indians. To deal with this, a committee has been formed with Dr. Nanji as Chairman and is being assisted by Indians. The daily average of patients is expected to be a hundred, and the daily expenditure £4, that is, less than a shilling per head. In view of the fact that, in addition to medicine, soup and other articles will have to be supplied to some of the patients, the expen- diture of £4 a day cannot be considered excessive. It is necessary that the leaders help in this work sincerely. If requisite efforts are made, we are sure the disease can be wiped out in a short time.

353,,PURITY OF THOUGHT,"
    
 WHAT  TRUE PATRIOTISM IS
 There is far too much of self-centredness or selfishness in India today. Instead we should have concern for the nation, that is to say, be patriotic. But since we are out to improve existing conditions, we should bear in mind that concern for national interest does not imply hatred of others. Before we can hate others, we should get tothe stage of being able to safeguard our national interest. There is hardly any immediate fear therefore of our hating foreign countries. However, what Sir William Wedderburn has written on the subject is worth reading and reflecting on. We give below a summary of his article in The Indian Review.
 There are some people in India today who believe that they should not approach the British Government for the redress of their grievances, for they fear that, if by any chance the British do redress their grievances, it will tighten their hold over the country, which will endanger our patriotism. This is a mistaken idea. Those who offer such advice seek to take upon their heads the sins of the Englishmen, who, priding themselves upon the colour of their skin, oppress Indians. This [idea] is moreover
 
 opposed to the movement afoot all over the world for peace and amity among mankind. Even if one replaced self-interest by the national interest, one would violate the highest morality. If a man wants to become virtuous and remain so, he will keep the highest morality in mind. And though he may not be able to act up to it, he must always aim high. He whose aim is not true will never hit his target. We should always try to climb higher in spite of our shortcomings. And this applies as much to a group or a community as to an individual Again, it applies with added force to India for, at present, she is considering what policy, what standard of conduct, she should adopt. To serve one’s own interest is low indeed; to serve the interest of the nation is to rise a step higher. He who gives up his life for his nation is considered a great man; but when the interest of the world at large is made to suffer in the nation’s interest, then [serving] the latter must be considered mean and degrading. If we wish to see peace and goodwill established throughout the world, we should remember that our personal and national interests are served by the well-being of the whole world. The Indian people have suffered a lot during the last few years because Englishmen who pride themselves on their patriotism pursued only their self- interest. Do Indian leaders wish to imitate these selfish English people? Do they hate the sinners but love the sin? They should not become the dupes of this temptation. The real enemies of freedom and prosperity are the autocratic  and  tyrannical powers; not the differences of race or colour. Though the Russians have their own government, it is oppressive and is as bad as that of India. The remedy for such a situation is the getting together of good and altruistic people, wherever they be in the world. It is therefore necessary to bring together the English reformers who are strong and Indian reformers who are weak. With the relations that prevail at present between England and India, such a meeting can easily be brought about. But the relations between the two countries have to be placed on a foundation of justice. The idea that the British are the masters and the Indians the servants must go. If this happens, England and India can stay together, befriend the world and work for the good of mankind.

354,,FRENCH INDIA,"
    
 Our readers may be aware that at one time the French also tried to establish their rule in India. They have held three bases in India since then, [together] known as French India. They are Chandrana- gore, Pondicherry and Calicutlibtech_458_footnote. It is often said that the French have a very sympathetic attitude towards Indians. An example of this was seen recently when the Governor of Pondicherry addressed the following letter to the Indians there:
 Citizens, I shall soon be there to see you and your  country. I shall inspect your farms and bunds and hear your petitions. You may come to me with full confidence. A repres- entative of the Republic is bound to regard all [citizens]  as equals and there is only one thing between us, viz., the laws. I will give you whatever [relief] I can under those laws; and Ishall explain their limitations to you quite clearly. Please do not ask me unnecessary or frivolous questions, for the time lost in answering them can be better used to solve more important problems.
 You are engaged in your agricultural work. I have also many jobs to attend to. So we have no time to meet in a grand hall and receive garlands of roses and jasmines. Believe  me when I say that I shall come to see you without pomp or show. And I shall be glad if I meet you in simplicity. If I meet you while you are at work, I shall get to know you the better and be able to see for myself and redress your grievances.

355,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 CHINESE PETITION ON ASIATIC BILL
 In reply to the Chinese Association’s letter about the sugges- tions made by the Indian community, Mr. Smuts has written saying that the Government has not agreed, and cannot agree, to them. On
 
 receipt of this reply, it is learnt, the Chinese have sent a cable to their Ambassador in England. The Chinese too are quite determined. The Secretary of the Chinese Association told me that, if the law received Royal assent, they too would go to gaol.
 COMMITTEE’S CABLE
 To the last cable sent by the Association to the British Committee, a reply has been received It says that efforts are being made to see General Botha; a strong communication has been addressed to Lord Elgin; and a meeting of the Members of the House of Commons will take Place on Wednesday. This reply was received on Thursday the 18th. A cable in The Rand Daily Mail of Saturday the 20th says that General Botha has agreed to meet the Committee. This is the news received to date.
 WHAT WILL BE OUTCOME?
 Because of the foregoing and the Committee’s letter, there is reason to believe that the Bill will receive assent. If this happens, it is clear that gaol-going will be the only remedy left. I hear, the gaol- going resolution was once being discussed in the presence of a white official, and he laughed and said, “I don’t at all believe, the Indian community will act up to such resolutions.” This rem-ark should be taken very seriously. There is no doubt at all that the Indian community has no reputation for bravery and that is why the whites dare to pass any laws they like with impunity. If the Bill becomes law and we give up the idea of gaol-going, the Indian comm-unity, we may take it, is doomed for ever.
 The white official’s derisive laugh shows that, if the whites had taken our gaol-going resolution seriously, they would never have introduced the Bill again. Now is the time to prove that we mean what we say. We have read about the boy who used to cry “wolf”. People would rush to his help and, finding no wolf, go back irritated. When a wolf did appear, however much the boy shouted, his neighbours took it for a joke, refused to go to his help, and the boy was killed. It is now absolutely necessary to show that our cries are genuine.
 SOME DOUBTS CLARIFIED
 Though great efforts are being made to prevent the Bill becoming law, we have to be prepared on the assumption that it will
 be passed. Questions have been asked from many quarters. I give below a clarification of the important questions raised.
 It has to be borne in mind that the whole struggle is on behalf of those who hold genuine permits, and those who are not thus equipped should therefore certainly leave the Transvaal. The pre-war residents and others, who have come after the war but hold genuine permits, have to put up a fight. Nobody can do the boys any harm. This point clarified, the important thing to understand is how the struggle is to be waged. In this regard we would say [the following]:
  It 	is improbable that 	all the persons [who 	do not 	take  out permits] 	will be 	sent to 	gaol or 	that they will all 	be taken 	to gaol 	at once.  After 	the law is 	passed, an 	order will 	be published requiring 	permits to 	be renewed within a 	specified period. No 	Indian should get 	his permit renewed 	within that period.  At 	the expiry 	of the 	period, the 	Government can 	arrest any person, if they choose, for residing in the Transvaal without a permit. It cannot be said for certain who will be arrested and where.  Suppose, 	a poor 	Indian is arrested. 	If he holds 	a lawful 	permit, Mr. Gandhi, 	as he declared 	last September, 	will defend 	him in 	the court free 	of charge.  At 	the time Mr. Gandhi 	himself will say that he 	had advised 	the entire community not 	to take 	out permits as 	required by 	the new law 	but instead 	to go to gaol 	in all 	humility, and 	that was 	why his client had 	not taken out 	a fresh permit.  When 	the counsel himself 	says this, it is 	possible that the  defaulter 	may be set free 	and the counsel 	arrested. That is, Mr. 	Gandhi will be 	arrested and 	his client let 	off. At 	that time, a 	similar deposition 	will! if possible, be made on behalf of the Association also.  However, 	it is possible 	that the arrested 	person may himself 	be sentenced. 	In that 	case, the 	first punishment 	may be 	that he 	will be 	asked to leave the 	Colony within a specified time.  At 	the expiry of 	the time-limit, the 	person will be 	re-arrested and 	sentenced to fine or imprisonment for disobeying the court’s order.  As 	the person concerned 	will refuse to pay the 	fine, he 	will have to 	go to gaol.  If 	many persons 	are thus prosecuted 	and all of 	them go 	to gaol, the chances are that they will be soon released and the law amended 
 suitably.
  It 	is possible that, if 	such a 	person does 	not leave the 	Colony after 	being released from gaol, he 	will be 	sent back to gaol.  The 	wife and 	children of 	a person 	so going 	to gaol 	will, if 	necessary, be 	maintained on 	subscriptions from the public. 
 This, in brief, is likely to be the position. In fact, the step [proposed] is not at all dangerous. AS shopkeepers and hawkers will have taken out their licences for the whole year, they will have no difficulty in carrying on their business. A shopkeeper can entrust his shop to any other person and himself enjoy life in gaol. For hawkers there will be no difficulty at all. I know from experience that many of them have been living such a miserable life that they will be much better off in gaol. There is no disgrace attached to going to gaol on this occasion; on the contrary, it will positively add to one’s prestige. There is no need, therefore, for anyone to take fright or lose courage. As I said in an earlier letterlibtech_459_footnote, if anyone has any questions to ask in this matter, he should address them directly to the Editor, P.O. Box No. 6522, Johannesburg, so that the replies can be published in these columns. Meanwhile, I would appeal to all Indians to note that this gaol-going is a great adventure, and that no Indian must retract. Else it will be like losing a battle already won.
 ‘‘HOW BAD THESE INDIANS ARE !’’
 With reference to the strong criticism of Mr. Chamney’s Report made by the editor of this paper in The Rand Daily Mail a white from Leydenburg, under the pen-name “Just”, has written an unjust letter, in which he says:
 All the seven days in the week are working days for the Indians and they work from sunrise to sunset. On Sundays they write up their account books and hawkers settle their accounts. Others either keep the shop open on holidays blatantly or station a man outside to smuggle customers in. Moreover, Indian merchants in rural areas examine samples brought by agents on Sundays so that the latter too can work all the days in the week. The Indians know nothing about making payments on time. It is the usual practice with them to turn a 90-day credit into one for 150 days. It is not unusual for them to settle a creditor’s account  by  paying him only a part of his dues. There are countless
 
 insolvent Indians carrying on business in their own names or in those of their relatives. The intelligence they show in the use of pleas while purchasing goods [on credit] is equalled only by the denseness they feign in explaining away their insolvency. Ninety-five percent of all Indian trade is corrupt. An Indian will not lose a customer and will sell him goods even at a loss, for the loss is to be suffered not by him, but by his creditor. Traders who deal with such Indians are of course no less to blame. Only if, follo-wing the example of the Orange River Colony, the Transvaal too closes down Indian shops with or without compensation, will clean trade be possible for European traders in towns such as Standerton, Heidelberg, Ermilom and Klerksdorp.
 Referring to this letter, the editor of The [Rand Daily] Mail says that, if what “Just” says is all true, one fails to see how so many Europeans trade with Indians.
 Thus the letter by “Just” has already been answered. But while some of his criticism is unduly exaggerated, it will only be fitting that we admit the force of much of it. We work day and night, do not rest even on Sundays, fail to keep promises and settle accounts by making only part-payments to creditors. There is no doubt we should effect improvements in these four matters. We need an innate sense  of honour, and, as His Majesty the Amir advised, it is essential for us to have western education.libtech_460_footnoteThere are nowadays any number of associat- ions. If a well-known merchant founds an “Association for  the Reform of the Trading Class” and brings about the much-needed reforms, many of our disabilities will disappear and the stringent licence regulations will also go.
 DIVINE WRATH
 These days the tram service in Johannesburg often becomes dislocated. Hardly a day passes without a break-down. There can be two reasons for this. The Indian community may persuade itself that it results from God’s wrath on the municipality which  prohibits Coloured persons from travelling by these trams. Another reason may be that those entrusted with the installation of electric motors have, for the sake of money, cheated and not done their work according to the contract.

         REGISTRATION 	LAW    [April 	28, 1907] 
  The Rand Daily Mail has—for the present at any 	rate—come to the rescue of Indians. Two leading articles appeared 	during the last week. Commenting upon Lord Milner’s article in the 	 National Review, The Rand Daily Mail 	pointed out that the Colonies could not carry on without the 	other parts of the British Empire. For example, the trade of New 	South Wales in Australia with India is valued at £1 million a year. 	Its trade with Ceylon is even larger. Its exports to India exceed 	her exports to New Zealand and her exports to Ceylon are larger than 	those to South Africa. The article shows that the Colonies cannot do 	without India. The liberation of India will come about as soon as 	Indians wake up and become conscious of their rights. As far as the 	Transvaal is concerned, the remedy lies in our own hands: it is to 	go to gaol if the registration law is passed.  	The second article in The Rand Daily Mail has greater 	relevance to the registration law than the first one. The writer 	says that the 
 present Asiatic Office seems to serve no purpose. Its report shows that the Office has proved a failure. Though it has several clerks, inspec- tors and liveried peons, Indians can enter without permits. Though over £4,000 are paid by it every year on account of salaries, it is said that all the power is concentrated in the hands of a single Eurasian clerk. If this is so, one cannot see the point of spending £4,000 on the Asiatic Office; it would be better to entrust everything to that clerk. In fact, the permit problem is one of adequate police vigilance, not of enacting a new law.
 The Rand Daily Mail has thus strongly criticised and roundly condemned the Asiatic Office. It would appear then that the Office is viewed’ with disfavour by others as well.
 MEETING IN ENGLAND
 A cable received here states that the meetinglibtech_461_footnoteof the Members of the House of Commons took place on Wednesday, the 24th. Sir Henry Cotton took the chair. Mr. Cox and other Members spoke. It was decided to have interviews with Mr. Morley and General Botha. I am writing this on Sunday. More news is expected on Tuesday.
 ASIATIC BAZAAR
 The authority to control Asiatic Bazaars or Locations has been vested in the respective municipalities. For the present this has little significance, as there exists no law compelling Indians to go to Locations. But it should be remembered that, if the Indian community submits to the new law, another law will be passed immediately forcing Indians to Locations, and then the municipal authority will prove very troublesome.
 MEETING OF SOUTH AFRICAN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE
 The twelfth annual meeting of the Chambers of Commerce of South Africa took place on the 24th at Pretoria, when Mr. Mackintosh of Port Elizabeth presided. Mr. Prady of Germiston moved a  resolution to the effect that Asiatics should be prevented from coming [into the Colony] and their trade stopped. He said in his speech that great harm was done by Indian trade as the whites could not compete with Indian traders. The whites had struggled hard in South Africa for a hundred years. How could Indians be allowed to oust them?
 
 
 Conditions in Standerton, Heidelberg, Potchefstroom and other places had deteriorated very much. If the influx of Indians could not be stopped forthwith, he said, they should be so heavily taxed that they could not afford to stay on. According to him, it would be better to drive out the existing traders, even after paying them compensation, if necessary.
 Mr. Hobson of Maseru, who supported him, said that Indian traders had penetrated far into Basutoland and had captured most of the trade. However, according to him, Mr. Prady’s resolution for winding up Indian business immediately was too drastic.
 Sir William Van Hulsteyn said that all South  Africa  was opposed to Indians. But it was not proper to drive them out all at once or to discontinue their trade; it would be better to insist on their carrying on business in Bazaars only. The question of immigration did not concern the Chambers of Commerce, and hence they could not interfere in the matter. He moved an amendment to the effect that it was necessary immediately to frame laws on Asiatic trade for the whole of South Africa.
 Mr. Quinn supported the amendment. Mr. Henderson of Natal said that the Indian merchants had brought ruin to Natal. In Ladys- mith and other places the entire trade had passed into their hands. Like locusts they devoured Natal. They caused harm to the Kaffirs also for the latter were powerless against them.
 Mr. Jagger of Cape Town said that he too was opposed to Indians, but that sudden and complete prohibition was a difficult task. The Imperial Government would never assent to such laws. He therefore moved that, since the presence of the Indian community was detrimental to [the interests of] South Africa, immediate legisla-tion was necessary to restrict their immigration and trade.
 Mr. Ireland of Zoutpansburg said that Mr. Prady’s resolution went too far. It was certainly necessary to adopt quick measures in the matter. The Asiatics were like the plague. Mr. Forest said that he shuddered to think of the number of Indians in Natal. Mr. Chappel of Pretoria supported the amendment. Mr. Burke suggested to Mr. Prady that he ought to withdraw his resolution so that the amendment, being unanimously passed, would carry due weight. Mr. Prady withdrew his resolution and the amended resolution was unanimously carried.
Then a discussion took place on the subject of the Dealers’
 Licenses Act. It was resolved that all Colonies should pass laws similar to that in force in the Cape, with local variations as necessary.
 “AKIKO” OF HASANMIAN’S SON
 A son has been born to Sheth Hasanmian, a partner of the firm of Sheth Mahomed Cassim Camroodeen. The akiko ceremony took place on Sunday, when a grand feast was given. Guests came from far and near and a lavish dinner was cooked for nearly 500 persons. Mr. Abdul Kadir had specially come from Durban for the occasion; so had Mr. Haji Habib from Pretoria. The occasion was celebrated with great eclat.
 Some [of our readers] may not know what akiko is. It is the ceremonial shaving of the head of the new-born child on the seventh day. According to their wealth and position, parents set aside gold, silver or copper equal in weight to the hair, and the value of the metal is spent on the feast.
 ATTACK ON NEW CLARE WASHERMEN
 A strong communication appears in The Sunday Times on the subject of washing places at New Clare. The writer says that the wholeland at New Clare stinks with putrid air. Indian washermen, according to him, have defiled the washing places; the water is dirty and stinks, so that clothes washed in it are as good as not washed at all. The writer is afraid that some day an epidemic is bound to break out because of clothes washed in that water. The Indian washermen have to be careful about this. The washing place should be drained each time and filled again with clean water. If this is not done, there is every fear of the washermen losing their livelihood, as the writer has suggested that the municipality should take effective measures.
 “COOLIE MERCHANTS”
 Under the above heading, a contributor has written bitterly for the Sunday Times. He alleges that it is only the Kaffirs and Indian hawkers who trade in gold pilfered from mines. It is only thus that they get rich. They melt the gold so stolen, make bracelets or armlets out of them and wear them on their persons. The detectives know this, but they do not, and sometimes cannot, arrest the offenders.  The  writer is certain of this, but good Indians and their English friends are not aware of this. He has, however, no doubt that Indians are carrying on smuggling on a huge scale.
 No one knows how much of this is true. But it is necessary that those Indians who are in this business of smuggling should take the hint.
 INCITEMENT BY “THE STAR”
 The Star has reproduced in full Mr. Ritch’s letter published in The Morning Post with its own comments. It says that the Indian community is vigilant and its friends in England are very powerful. There are no dissensions among Indians and they work well. They are very influential and they do not pause for breath even for a moment. The Imperial Government is greatly afraid of them. In the circumstances, says The Star, it will not be surprising if the new Bill is refused assent. The whites are sitting back without being interested in the Ordinance. The Star, therefore, suggests that the whites should hold big meetings and take steps to see that the Ordinance was passed. Otherwise Indian infiltration would increase to the detriment of the whites.
 Clearly the whites are afraid that the law may not be approved. At this juncture it is necessary for us to exert all our strength. If this is done, a victory [for us] even now would be nothing surprising. . But I am wrong. Those who have accepted the gaol-going resolution have already won. For them there is victory either way.
 DEPUTATION TO GENERAL BOTHA
 A cable in The Rand Daily Mail indicates that a deputation on the subject of the Asiatic Registration  Act,  led  by  Lord  Ampthill, has already met General Botha. The deputation included  Sir Muncherji, Sir Henry Cotton, Mr. Harold Cox, Mr. Justice Ameer Ali, Mr. Ritch and others. Lord Ampthill said that no laws which humil- iated the Indian community should be introduced. Indians, who are already in the Transvaal, should be enabled to live there honourably. In his reply General Botha said that there was no intention whatever of humiliating Indians, and that he would use his influence as practicable to preserve their honour. The members of the deputation told the Press representatives that General Botha’s reply was satisfactory.

            TO  THE 	EDITOR  INDIAN OPINION  SIR,          JOHANNESBURG,  April 	30, 1907 
  	Many of our brethren have written to me to say that they will go to 	gaol in pursuance of the September Resolution, if the Registration 	Act of the Transvaal is passed. Every one of them deserves to be 	congratulated. From some of the letters, I find that a few are 	annoyed at the absence of such letters from leaders. Their not 	having written is,  I am sure, no reason for doubting them. I do not 	think that they will come forward to take out the compulsory 	registers.  	However, lest I should be guilty of this sin of omission, I hereby 	declare my Pledge that, should the new law come into force, I will 	never take out a permit or register under the law but will go to 	goal; and even if I am the only one left who has not taken a permit, 	my pledge shall stand for the following reasons:   I 		consider it 		a humiliation 		to submit 		to this 		law, and I prefer 		to go 		to gaol 		rather than submit to 		such humiliation; I believe that my country is dearer to me than my person;  if, 		after having announced 		the September 		Resolution to the 		world, the Indian community submits to the law, it will lose everything;  I 		believe that 		prominent men 		who have been helping 		our cause 		in England rely upon the Fourth Resolution; if we shrink back, we shall     
 not only bring dishonour on them but forfeit their help for ever;
  the 	remedy of 	gaol-going cannot be 	applied against other 	laws, but for 	this Act, 	it is an infallible remedy 	and it 	can be adopted by 	everyone, whether small or great;  if 	I now retract, I shall be deemed 	unfit to 	serve the Indian 	community;  I 	believe that Indians 	will rise in public 	esteem if all of 	them remain 	staunch in not 	submitting to 	the law, and 	that, moreover, it 	will evoke sympathy in India also for the cause of the Transvaal Indians. 
 Many other reasons can be adduced. In the end I appeal to every Transvaal Indian not to miss this occasion and not to turn back. I beg the Indians of Natal, the Cape and Delagoa Bay to encourage us, the Transvaal people, and render help when the need arises.

           BOX 	6522, JOHANNESBURG  April 	30, 1907 
    TO  THE 	 EDITOR 	THE STAR 	[JOHANNESBURG]  SIR,    	You have raised the bogey of the “Indian Peril” and based it on 	Mr. Ritch’s able letter to The Morning Post. Fortunately 	for the country, you have evidently mis-read Mr. Ritch’s letter 	and ascribed to him a demand not made by him for political rights on 	behalf of British Indians. If you will be good enough to re-read the 	letter, you will find that instead of claiming any such rights, Mr. 	Ritch has      
 repudiated the claim more than once. He says:
 In deference to the demand of the white colonist for protection against an unrestricted influx of Asiatics, the qualifications imposed by an Immigra- tion Restriction Law, upon an educational basis, are assented to. He (the Indian) seeks no political power, and admits the right of municipalities to control the issuing of trading licences, with power of appeal to the judicial tribunals of the Colony against inequitable administration.
If words have any meaning, you have, in the above sentences in
 the letter you have printed, a complete denial of the charge made against the community.
 The ground, therefore, being cleared as to the allegation of the British Indian wanting to have political power in South Africa, with your permission, I would venture to, draw your attention to the fact that you are creating animosity between two communities living under the same flag without the slightest occasion, and, in support of my statement, I ask you to read the compromise offered by the British Indian Association, whereby everything that will be done by the Registration Act can be done immediately and without Imperial sanction being necessary. Greater identification is the cry  raised. British Indians have themselves offered to exchange their lawful documents for those bearing sufficient identification particulars as may be mutually agreed upon. Not that the present documents do not contain enough details to identify the holders. The compromise has been offered to soothe the agitated mind of the colonist. Moreover, the compromise, strange as it may appear, goes further  than the Asiatic Act itself, in that the former includes the taking out of permits by minors who have reached the age of discretion, the same to be decided by the Colonial Secretary.
 You may ask why, if the offer is sincere, should there be any fuss about the Act. The answer is obvious. British Indians do not wish to be classed as criminals, as they undoubtedly are by the Act. They repudiate totally the suggestion that there is any illegal influx on a wholesale scale, or that there is any countenance of such influx on the part of the leaders of the community. Repressive legislation is requ- ired when those to whom it applies are not compliant and do not do voluntarily what is asked of them. British Indians have always claimed to be law-abiding, and,therefore, object to the class legislation which is   a denial of the claim. You may call this sentiment, if you will. Still, it is one which is very real for the community I have the honour to represent, and it is hardly necessary for me to give you illustrations of sentiment having ruled men’s actions from the time of Adam.
 The suggested compromise can  cost  little.  If  there is  any doubt as to its effectiveness, why not give it a trial while the Act isconsidered? Will it not be better and more Imperialistic for you to advocate the adoption of the compromise than unnecessarily  to inflame the populace against harmless subjects of the Crown?
 I am, etc.,

 [JOHANNESBURG,
 Before May 2, 1907]libtech_465_footnote
 
  [SIR,]   In 	connection with the action proposed to be taken by the Rand 
  	Pioneers and the Transvaal Municipal Association regarding the 	Asiatic Registration Act, I venture, on behalf of my Association, to 	draw your Committee’s attention to the compromise offered by the 	British Indians, and to the fact that it completely meets every 	requirement of the Registration Act and hastens the fulfilment of 	the object your Committee has in view.  	My Association has always held the opinion that, as a matter of 	fact, there is very little difference between what is required by 	the white colonists and what has been accepted by British Indians. 	The latter ask for no political rights and, as against the repeal of 	Law 3 of 1885, they consent to municipal control, subject to review 	by the Supreme Court, over trading licences, and to restriction on 	immig- ration along the Natal or the Cape basis.  	My Association is firmly of opinion that much of the agita-tion is 	due entirely to a misunderstanding of the mutual position.     
 My Association, therefore, ventures to suggest that, if your Commi- ttee will be prepared to meet a deputation of my Association, a great deal of friction can be removed and a solution of the que-stion can be locally arrived at without the weaker party having to seek Imperial protection.
 My Association has no doubt that your Committee  is  not actuated by any vindictive motives in its agitation my Association for consultation will be accepted in the spirit in against Coloured people. It is, therefore, hoped that the suggestion made by which it is offered. If your Committee accepts the proposal, any date after the 8th instant will suit my Association.libtech_466_footnote

  	May I once more take the liberty of correcting you? I fear you have 	not yet understood the compromise. The cry is not “Trust the 	Indians”, as you have put it. The cry is trust the Indians in the 	interim, and see whether the trust is not justified. Under the 	Registration Act, all Indians have to be compulsorily registered. 	Under the Indian offer they can be voluntarily registered, and that 	now. But, supposing that the lowest class of Indians, as you have 	been pleased to classify some Indians, who enter the Colony, do not 	accept the proposal of the

 British Indian Association, the key to the situation is in the hands of the Government. A bill can then be passed cancelling all permits save those issued under the compromise, unless they are exchanged within a certain time. The law will then reach the culprits and leave the innocent free. The Act at present punishes the vast majority of the innocent, self-respecting people, for the sake of the guilty few. You dismiss the objections of the Indian community by describing them as super sensitive. You dismiss Lord Ampthill and his friends equally unceremoniously by ascribing to them what you, I suppose, would call the “Oriental taint”, and depriving them of the possession of a spirit of wider Imperialism. I can only remind you that Lord Milner, whom you will not classify with Lord Ampthill, in his article in The National Review, in reminding the colonists of wider Imperialism, places before them their responsibilities to British dependencies, and especially British India.

         	We publish elsewhere a summary of the address presented to Mr. 	Smuts, Acting Prime Minister of the Transvaal, by the Klerksdorp 	Indians, and of his reply. It is clear from the reply that Mr. Smuts 	himself fears that his law, even if assented to, will be rendered 	ineffective if the Indian community sticks to the resolution on 	gaol- going. He therefore tries to persuade everyone that the 	Association’s agitation against the Act is pointless. This much 	even Mr. Smuts seems to admit, that the law punishes, as it were, 	the whole Indian community just because there have been a few fresh 	cases of infiltration into the Transvaal. He adds that it may happen 	for a time that the police will question people in every nook and 	corner. Only Mr. Smuts can tell what is meant by “for a time”. 	There is absolutely no doubt that the Indian community should under 	no circumstances submit to such a law Mr. Smuts’s speech should be 	treated as a provocation to Indians. He seems to hold that the 	Indian community can be ill-treated with impunity. It looks as if it 	will now get a chance to open his eyes [to the truth]. [From 	Gujarati]  Indian 	Opinion, 4-5-1907

363,,CAPE INDIANS,"
    
 The Immigration Act of the Cape is so complicated that its implications cannot be realized just yet, but by and by the adverse effects will follow. One clause is especially mischievous: if any Indian leaves the Cape without a permit, his right to return will lapse. This means that, if 3 leading Indian businessman of the Cape leaves without the annual permit, he will not be able to return. Even if his business in the Cape continues and his family stays on there, that will not help him. We do not mean to suggest that the law will in fact hit the businessman so hard, but such are the implications of the Act. The result will be that all poor Indians will have to leave the Cape. And if a few Indians stay behind, what influence can they have? The Indian businessmen in the Cape should heed this warning and see to it that no Indian leaves the Cape without a permit. We hope that those Cape Indians who happen to read this will bring it to the notice of the others and explain it to them.

364,,RIOTS IN THE PUNJAB,"
    
 Cables giving startling news have been published in The Rand Daily Mail and The Leader of Johannesburg. We give their substance below:
 The people in the Punjab appear to be preparing for a revolt. This is the first upheaval of the kind seen in India after 1857. The Native Press has been inciting the people both openly and secretly. It was not right that [the editor of] the Punjabi should have been prosecuted. What only a few men knew is now known to the whole of India. The journal has become more powerful. People have ceased to be afraid of the repressive measures of the Government. Similar consequences followed the prosecution of the [editors of] Bombay papers. The officials have become panicky. In the Punjab, judges have enlisted themselves as volunteers and taken up arms. In the circumst- ances, the idea of staging a ‘siege of Delhi’ was abandoned. But
 
 people’s minds do not yet seem to have been set at rest.
 So go on the cables. It is our request that all of us should pray to Khuda or Ishwar for the good of India. The present is a critical time for India as indeed it is for us here in South Africa. We have to do our duty here. If ever manliness and courage were needed in the country’s cause, it is now.

 "
365,"May 7, 1907",INTERVIEW TO “THE NATAL MERCURY”,"
    
 [May 7, 1907]
 
 Mr. M. K. Gandhi was yesterday interviewed by a Mercury representative concerning the suggestion put forward by Mr. Lionel Curtis in  The  Times—a reference to which was contained in our telegraphic news columns on Monday—that the tropical possessions of Great Britain should be reserved for Indian colonization. Mr. Gandhi rejects the proposal.
 As long as Indians have domicile rights in the Colonies, whether in South Africa or elsewhere, Mr. Gandhi objects, such a suggestion is not practicable, and would certainly not be acceptable to the British Indians. As he has so often asserted, the entire motive which is animating the cause he has taken up on behalf of the South African Asiatic is to protect what he designates the Indians’ “vested rights” in this country; and to deprive them of the title of domicile, which many of them now possess, would, of course, in his view, be to subvert those vested rights. Mr. Gandhi said that the rights of domicile were the main strength of the Indians’ position, and he assented to the suggestion that they intended to make the most of it.
 It was pointed out to Mr. Gandhi that the proposal seemed to be that the tropical Colonies should be reserved for immigration of the future, not necessarily contemplating the removal of Indians already possessing domicile rights, and he was asked what his view of that idea would be.
 Mr, Gandhi denied that there was any pressure of population in India leading to the necessity of emigration, and pointed to the fact that the Indians who were brought over as indentured labourers did not offer themselves, but had to be persuaded to come
 —that, moreover, recruiting was becoming increasingly difficult. The same applied to the recruiting for other places in which Indian labour was wanted, and he advanced this to show that India had no real surplus population, and needed no outlet. The idea of reserving any territory outside India at all for exclusive colonization by Indians
 was therefore a gratuitous and unnecessary one. He did not believe that the resources of India had become too exhausted to support its people or the natural increase of its population. There was room for what he called “internal” emigration within India itself, but no need of any territorial provision outside.
 He had often been asked, Mr. Gandhi proceeded, why, if this were so, Indians were found emigrating in such numbers to South Africa. The explanation was that South Africa had itself made the mischief by adopting the practice of indentured immigration—a system which, Mr. Gandhi said, nearly every Indian in South Africa would sign a petition against, and ask that it should cease.
 [REPORTER:] But the trouble arises, Mr. Gandhi, not so much from  the indentured Indian as from the free merchant class, and from whom the demand for equal trading rights mostly comes.
 [GANDHIJI:] The Indian merchant follows the other Indians, to whom he looks for his business. If the indentured man was not here, the merchant would not be here. As it is, many of the better-class Indian merchants, who have large interests, remain in their own country, where they have scope for their business, and where every Indian tradesman would have scope if he preferred to stay instead of coming to the Colonies. As long as there remain opportunities for business among his own countrymen, there the Indian merchant will be found.
 . . .Mr. Gandhi instanced the case of Zanzibar. There was, in fact, no need to reserve tropical Colonies for Indian occupation, for East Africa was already open.
 Mr. Gandhi went on to refer to the Registration Ordinance in the Transvaal, and referred in disappointed terms to the decision of the Imperial Government to allow its sanction to the measure. Its effect was, he said, to place the Transvaal Indian in the position of a ticket-of-leave man. If they were to be dealt with along these lines it was better that the Indians should be undeceived at once. Mr. Gandhi said he foresaw the possibility of a position in which Great Britain would have to decide between losing the Colonies or leasing India, for the people’s self- respect was involved, and their existence under such conditions as in the Transvaal would become intolerable. The Indian was perfectly capable of realizing both sides of the question. and, he thought, did so, but the Asiatic problem was not to be solved by measures such as the Transvaal Ordinance. Asked whether he regarded the passing of the Ordinance as a weakening of the Indians’ position in South Africa, Mr. Gandhi asserted that it undoubtedly was so, but he believed that the disappointment of their hopes would in the end result advantageously, if the Indians would abide by their resolve to resist. There would be said Mr. Gandhi, no resistance by force, but passive
 resistance; and if the Indian people carried out their determination to undergo imprisonment rather than conform to the Ordinance, he thought well enough of the Colonial white to believe that such a demonstration of courage for the sake of a principle would be met with administration and, in the end, sympathy.

 ready.    From 	the Gujarati original: S.N. 4789           	The Transvaal Act has received [Royal] assent earlier than we 	expected. The Imperial Government has chosen to take the first step 	of binding the Indian community with chains. It now remains to be 	seen whether the community will carry this yoke.  	We know of a young student from Japan who once went to a lawyer in 	Johannesburg for some personal work. As the lawyer could not see him 	immediately, the student waited outside. Meanwhile, an English 	official came to meet the lawyer. As he was about to enter the 	lawyer’s office after knocking, the young Japanese held him by the 	sleeve and said to him spiritedly: “You cannot go in just yet. I 	have a prior right.” Being a gentleman, the officer at once saw 	the point, and requested the young man’s permission to go in 	first, as he had urgent work. The student was as polite as he had 	been bold. For, when the official asked his leave, he readily 	allowed him to go in. This anecdote 
 should be engraved on the mind of every Indian, for it gives an exact idea of our bond of slavery. The young Japanese did not allow his self-respect to be flouted. When every one in Japan, the rich as well as the poor, came to believe in self-respect, the country became free. She could give Russia a slap in the face, and today Japan’s flag flies very high in the world. Though her people wear a yellow  skin,  Japan enjoys friendship with white England as between equals. In the same way we too need to feel the spirit of self-respect. Having remained in bondage for a long time like a caged parrot, we cannot realize what honour and freedom are Furthermore, like the parrot which is pleased when bound with a golden string and made to perform, we too are elated and blush pink at the thought of our imagined happiness, when our masters, whether white or Coloured, feign affection for us only in order to bind us with the golden thread and make us forget our real condition. To remind us of that condition, this irksome law has been sanctioned. Shall we now obey it and become slaves? Our Johannes burg correspondent says that the regulations under the new law will be lenient and considerate. That is to say, Lord Elgin may bind us with a golden thread. Shall we allow ourselves to be deluded thus? We, for our part, can only reply in the negative to both these questions.
 A great deal of effort is required to get this law repealed, and in no case must we turn back. Let us give this matter a little thought. A huge meeting was held in September, and we proclaimed that the Indian community would go to gaol rather than submit to  the  proposed Act.libtech_471_footnoteWhile doing so, every Indian took an oath in the name of Ishwar or Khuda. Though that law was disallowed, the one now passed is exactly of the same nature. All the arguments that could be advanced against such an act then can be put forward now, and in fact many more. For we have worked hard against it and shouted our protests from house-tops. Moreover, we thought the Bill so objectionable that we raised big subscriptions with which to send the Deputation to England; it cost us £700. In the presence of high officials, the Deputation told Lord Elgin:
 We should also place before Your Lordship one more fact and that is the Fourth Resolution passed by the mass meeting. That Resolution, which was unanimously approved by the
 
 meeting in all humility and firmness and affirmed with an oath, said that, if ever the Imperial Government should approve the Act, the Indian community would go to gaol rather than suffer the great indignity inflicted on it by the Act. So deep was the feeling of the community. We have submitted to much suffering till now. But the disgrace of this act is unbearable, and that is why we have travelled six thousand miles to make an appeal to you. With this Act we have reached the utmost limit.
 As though this were not enough, and as if there was the slightest doubt in anyone’s mind about the gaol-going resolution, the South Africa British Indian Committee was formed, and many prominent men joined it. Now if, under any pretext, the Indian  community should cancel the gaol-going resolution, what would be the result? Only that the South Africa British Indian Committee would have become futile. The Deputation’s labours would have been in vain. .All the fame that the Indian community has now gained would turn into disgrace. The Government would henceforth put no trust in the Indian community’s word. We would be classed with the lowest and meanest. If this should happen, the Imperial Government would give ready assent to all the laws directed against the Indians in South Africa. And in the end those who are not content to live a dog’s life or that of a crow will have to leave South Africa. Moreover, if things should come to such a pass, there would be repercussions in India too, and the whole country might look down upon us with well-deserved contempt. Such are the force and the usefulness of the Fourth Resolution, and so serious its implications. It is therefore our earnest hope that the Indian community will not swerve from it. Whether or not all of us are  agreed, those who realize how things stand must not fail in their duty.

 A second appeal has been preferred in this case. The licensing court has decided not to issue the licence. Though this is regrettable, we congratulate the Indian community. For it is only when  such blatant injustice is done that we wake up, and also rouse the Imperial

370,,INDENTURED INDIANS,"
    
 As a result of the Durban Corporation’s decision to reduce the rice ration, the indentured Indians employed by them have struck work, and have got ready to go to gaol. They did this earlier also. On that occasion, the Magistrate was kind. He observed that, even though it was legal to give them maize instead of rice, it would be cruel to insist on the [letter of the] law. He therefore let the men off and advised the Corporation to give them rice as usual, even if it was dearer. The same situation has arisen today, but the Magistrate is Mr. Beans. He has given judgement strictly according to the law and sentenced many workers to a fine of £1 each. We hope Indian lawyers will look into the matter and do something about it.
If we think of the Transvaal Ordinance in this context, we can
 see that, when laws are found to be harsher, even poor indentured workers can muster enough courage to rise against them and get  ready to go to gaol. We have seen from the case of the indentured men that such remedies often secure justice. If indentured labourers can do so much in self-interest, who will deny that the Indian community in the Transvaal ought to do no less?

 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH
 Elsewhere in this number we publish an account of a meetinglibtech_473_footnoteheld in honour of Mr. Omar Zaveri. Since our readers must be eager to learn about his career, here is a biographical sketch Mr. Omar
 
 Zaveri was born at Porbunder in 1872. He set out for Africa at the early age of twelve with his brother, the late renowned Mr. Aboobaker Zaverilibtech_474_footnote. While on the ship he began his education, and learnt Gujarati. For four years he studied privately and at the Government School in Durban. His studies were cut short by the death of Aboobaker in 1887. In 1890 he joined the firm of his guardian, Mr. Abdulla Haji Adam, as an apprentice. Then he satisfied, to some extent, his keen desire to learn Arabic and Persian. In 1897 he took part in public activities for the first time and was made Joint Honorary Secretary of the Durban Anjuman [-e-] Islam. Omar was interested in horticulture, and as fruit was scarce in Porbunder, he experimented with fruit- growing as a result of which some fruits are now to be had there in plenty. For six months during 1904, he toured Egypt, Italy, Switzerland, France, England and America and obtained valuable experience.libtech_475_footnoteAt this time, he had with him a barrister as a tutor- companion. It was meant to be an educational tour.
 While in London, he met Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, Sir Muncherji Bhownaggree and others, and returned to Durban the same year. He was then made Joint Honorary Secretary of the Natal Indian Congress, along with Mr. Adamji Miankhan. The work he has done since then is well known to the Indian community. His wealth, his servants, his house, his time and his education—all these have been entirely at the disposal of the community. During the Transvaal Deputation’s visit to England and again during the agitation against the Dealers’ Licenses Act, Mr. Omar Zaveri worked very hard along with Mr. Anglia. Mr. Zaveri also took a leading part in founding the Memon Committee. The Durban Library has received many gifts of books from him and he himself visited it almost daily. Impelled by a kind nature, he has always attempted to bring about private settle-ment of disputes among members of the Indian community. People hold such a high opinion of his integrity that he has had with him a general power of attorney from a number of people. In the course of all this work, Mr. Omar realized the need for further education and intends to become a barrister after passing the Matriculation examina-tion. As an instance of his humility and simplicity, it may be mentioned that he himself teaches his servants and children at home whenever he has the leisure.

372,,KALYANDAS JAGMOHANDAS [MEHTA],"
    
 Another gentleman who, by virtue of his qualities is a zaveri— although his name is Kalyandas—has sailed home by the same boat as Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri. Mr. Zaveri’s function was to lead, that of Mr. Kalyandas to work silently for a good cause remaining in the background. In years he is still a child, but in our experience we have seldom come across a youth so tender of heart, so scornful of money, so regardless of his own body but at the same time so solicitous of the welfare of others. Johannesburg Indians are aware of the work done by Kalyandas during the terrible outbreak of plague in that city. We do not know of anyone having had occasion to be displeased with him at any time. India’s chains would snap this day, if in that country captains like Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri and soldiers like Kalyandas came forward in large numbers. Rarely does one come across heroes who would ceaselessly, and always with a cheerful smile, quietly give themselves over to public service in pursuance of duty, that is, in the name of Khuda, seeking neither money nor honours, and never even creaming of leadership. Kalyandases are rare indeed.

373,,FAREWELL TO OMAR HAJI AMOD ZAVERI libtech_477_footnote,"
    
 Many gentlemen gave parties in honour of the well-known and popular Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri, the Joint Honorary Secretary of
 
 the Natal Indian Congress, on the eve of his departure for India [last week]. Finally a meeting of the Natal Indian Congress was held on the evening of the 6th at Dawad Mahomed’s Hall in Pyne Street. Those who gave parties to Mr. Zaveri include Mr. Dada Osman, Mr. Ahmed Osman, Mr. Tayob Moosa, Mr. Peeran Mahomed, members of the staff of Indian Opinion, Mr. Dada Abdulla, Mr. G. H. Miankhan, Mr.
 M. C. Anglia, Mr. Mahomed Cassim Camroodeen and Mr. Parsee Rustomjee. At each of these parties the number of invitees ranged from 40 to 100, and to some of them gentlemen from all the Indian communities Hindu, Muslim, Parsi, Christian—were invited. At all these functions the qualities of Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri were extolled in various ways. The hope was expressed that, during his absence [from the Transvaal], Mr. Zaveri might be able to go on the Haj pilgrimage and also realize his desire of becoming a barrister. At one of the functions Mr. Ismail Gora expressed the hope that Mr. Zaveri would take advantage of his visit to Porbunder to resolve the dispute going on there about the Madressa. At the party given by Mr. Peeran Mahomed Mr. Gandhi was present, having come from the Transvaal for the occasion. As the news about the passing of the [Asiatic Registration] Act was received that day, the matter was also discussed at the party. Many speakers pointed out that Mr. Zaveri would be truly honoured if the spirit of patriotism he possessed could be inculcated in Indians, and if all of them supported the Transvaal Indians and exhorted them to adhere to the gaol-going resolution. Mr. Rustomjee had returned from Bombay on the same day on which  a party was given at his place. He was much satisfied with the work of Mr. Zaveri who held his general power of attorney during his absence. He said that he felt happy and proud to be present on the occasion. A gold watch, a gold chain and a pencil case were then presented to Mr. Zaveri.
 The party by the members of the staff of Indian Opinion was given at Phoenix. Twelve gentlemen from Durban, who out of regard for Mr. Zaveri did not mind the inconvenience of a journey to Phoenix, had accepted the invitation. The following address was presented to Mr. Zaveri by members of the staff:
 We, the undersigned, representing the staff of Indian Opinion, beg to express our thanks to you for the interest you have always taken in our Settlement, and in the political work which this journal is
 
 trying to do for the benefit of British Indians in South Africa.
 We trust that you will have a pleasant and safe voyage to India and that, while there, you will not slacken your efforts in trying to alleviate the sufferings and disabilities of your countrymen in the South African Colonies.
 We appreciate the interest you have taken in our  work  at Phoenix during your frequent visits, and we sincerely hope that you will soon return and be amongst us again.
 MEETING OF CONGRESS
 The hall was tightly packed for the Congress meeting on Monday. It was well decorated, the credit for which goes to Mr. Paul. At this meeting Mr. Dada Osman was elected Joint Secretary in place of Mr. Zaveri.
 Before the address was read out, the President, Mr. Dawad Mahomed, made the following speech:
 The primary reason for Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri’s popularity is that he is not partial to any community. He regards Hindu, Muslim, Parsi as well as Christian as his brothers. He looks upon his wealth [as something] to be used for the benefit of the community. Wealth that is not put to good use is useless. Mr. Zaveri, having come to feel that the glory of learning is greater than that of riches, has decided to pursue his studies further. If anyone thinks that education is impossible at this age, I would point out that Shaikh Saadi started his studies after the age of forty. Mr. Zaveri has freely used his men for Congress work. [For instance] Mr. Chhabildas rendered very good help [for that body].
 ASIATIC ORDINANCE
 Speaking on the passing of the Asiatic Act  Mr.  Dawad Mahomed said:
 I am very sorry indeed about the Act that has been passed in the Transvaal. I shuddered when I read the telegram announ- cing the passing of the Act. It is very humiliating to us. Every Indian has a stake in opposing it. I have felt very  strongly  indeed that we should not submit to the law even if we have to lose our entire fortune [by opposing it]. I therefore hope that the Indian community in the Transvaal will firmly oppose the
 measure and be prepared to go to gaol, if that becomes  necessary. Gaol, if one is sent to it for a cause like this, would be a garden. It adds to one’s fame; there is nothing humilia-ting about it. I also hope that no one will have any dealings-with the Permit Office in Durban. If we do not muster adequate strength for opposing this law, the time for our departure will eventually come and bad laws will begin to be enacted in all parts of South Africa.
 CONGRESS ADDRESS
 We, the undersigned, on behalf of the Natal Indian Congress, wish to record our appreciation of the great and noble work you have performed for the Indian community during your term of office as [Joint Honorary] Secretary of the Natal Indian Congress, for Which office your recent travels in Europe and America excellently fitted you.
 By your unremitting zeal, great patience, and patriotism, you have kept your Indian work ever in the forefront and have rendered invaluable assistance to the public cause. Your sweet, sympathetic disposition, and your unswerving rectitude have endeared you to all, and it will be difficult to fill the gap [created] by your absence. You have lived up to the traditions handed down by your late lamented brother, Aboobaker. Your hospitality has become proverbial. Your house has been open to rich and poor alike.
 Your efforts in the cause of education, of which your encouragement of the Indian Public Library is only an instance among others, have been characterized by the same unflagging zeal that has pervaded all your public work. We know that it is your intention, in order that you may better serve your country, to improve your educational qualifications, and we  sincerely trust that your desire will be fulfilled by the grace of the Almighty.
 We wish you a pleasant voyage, a happy time in your home country, and a safe return.
 Presenting the address, Mr. Anglia said that, if he himself had been able to do any public work, it was thanks to Mr. Zaveri for it was his zeal and patriotism that had inspired the speaker. Mr. Zaveri used to do a great deal of work himself. Besides, he made his men also
 work for the Congress, prominent among whom was Mr. Chhabildas Mehta. He helped a great deal. It was impossible to fill the gap caused by Mr. Zaveri’s departure, but it was hoped that Mr. Dada Osman would more or less make up the loss. It was a matter of pleasure that Mr. Rustomjee should have arrived at the right moment. The Secretaries were sure to get much assistance from him. Mr. Anglia expressed the wish that Mr. Zaveri would become  a  barrister. Speaking about the Asiatic Registration Act, Mr. Anglia said that he had thought of going [to India] on a temporary permit but, as the law had now been passed, he had decided not to apply for a permit in order to show his disapproval of the measure. He hoped that the Transvaal Indians would stick to the gaol-going resolution and that no Indian would have any relations with the Permit Office.
 ADDRESS BY MEMON [FUND] COMMITTEE
 Mr. Peeran Mahomed, the Joint Secretary of the Memon Committee, read an address on behalf of that organization. Here is a translation of it
 We the members of the Memon Committee—which was formed to raise funds for helping poor Memons in every possible manner— wish to thank you most heartily for your exertions. Indeed, you are the founder of the fund, the organizer [of this Committee]. We can say without the slightest exaggeration that it owes its competence entirely to your devotion to the community, of which you are such an ornament. We can hope that, during your temporary absence, we shall be able to keep up the vitality of the Committee and hand it over to your charge when you return.
 ADDRESS BY INDIAN LIBRARY
 Mr. Osman Ahmed Effendi read an address on behalf of the Indian Library. The following is a translation:
 We the undersigned, representing the Committee of the Indian Public Library and the visitors to that Library, hereby place on record our deep sense of obligation to you for the very great and tangible help rendered by you to the Library. Your love of knowledge is well known, and it was in keeping with it that you rendered so much assistance to this humble institution.
 We trust that you will continue to show goodwill for the Library, and we hope that you will soon return to resume your
 multifarious activities in Natal for public causes.
 ADDRESS BY HINDU COMMUNITY
Mr. R. R. Moodley read the address of the Hindu community.
Here is a summary of it:
 We consider it to be our duty to thank you especially on the eve of your departure for India. Though  a thoroughly religious person, you have never made any distinction between Hindus and Muslims and have thereby won the hearts of both the communities. You have endeared yourself to all by your compassionate nature, truthfulness and regard for all. You have left us deeply obliged to you by your actions and have created an example worth following. We hope that you may reach India safely and, after your safe return, take up your work here again. Mr. Paul then garlanded Mr. Zaveri on behalf of the Literary Society and Mr. Ambaram Maharaj on behalf of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha.
 MR. GANDHI’S SPEECH
Mr. Gandhi, who then spoke, said:
 It is only right that we should present addresses to Mr. Zaveri. But Mr. Zaveri will accept our compliments as sincere only if we imitate him in his good qualities which we have praised in the course of our addresses. Mr. Zaveri has, however, done nothing for the sake of praise. He does not hunger for it and has rendered services to the community out of a sense of duty. He has shown by example what true wealth and education consist in. By using his wealth mostly in the service of the community, he has shown us the right use for it. He thinks that all the education he has acquired is for the sake of the country and uses it for that purpose. This is real education. Mr. Omar Zaveri believes that the most important means of overcoming India’s misfortunes is unity among Hindus and Muslims. Even in India one will rarely find a person who has done as much as Mr. Zaveri to bring about this unity. Moreover, Mr. Zaveri possesses the quality of truthfulness, which, besides strengthening each of these three qualities, makes them more attractive and weaves them into a harmonious  whole. It is only for this reason that we regard him as  a  true helmsman. We can be said truly to have honoured him only if we follow his example. It will be difficult for the new Secretary, Mr. Dada
 Osman, to fill the gap, but he is Mr. Zaveri’s partner and Mr. Zaveri has unhesitatingly recommended his name to the Congress. There is thus reason to believe that Mr. Dada Osman will bring credit to his office. Mr. Anglia’s and Mr. Dada Osman’s is thus an exacting burden. He can be no ordinary person who can take Mr. Zaveri’s place. We hope that these two gentlemen will faithfully follow Mr. Zaveri in his good qualities.
 Mr. Parsee Rustomjee, who returned that day from India, compared Mr. Omar Zaveri with Sir Pherozeshah Mehta.
 Mr. Abdulla Haji Adam Zaveri said that, as Omar was a close relative of his, he could not but observe that Omar  had  brought honour to their family. He hoped that the Transvaal Indians would never submit to the Transvaal Ordinance. He was followed by Dr. Nanji.
 PEERAN MAHOMED’S SPEECH
Mr. Peeran Mahomed said:
 I was Mr. Omar Zaveri’s neighbour. No amount of praise will be enough [to express our gratitude towards him]. I regard the Transvaal Ordinance as very oppressive. If a similar Ordinance comes into force here [in Natal], I say on oath with God as witness that I will never submit to it but go to gaol instead. I hope that the Transvaal Indians will do likewise. I agree with Mr. Anglia about Mr. Chhabildas Mehta. He has served the Congress very ably indeed.
 ISMAIL GORA’S SPEECH
Mr. Ismail Gora said:
 I endorse everything that has been said about Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri. He has served the community very well. As Mr. Rustomjee has returned from India, the work of the Congress will now go on smoothly. We have to put up a stiff fight against the Asiatic [Registration] Act. The Transvaal Indians can never go back on the Fourth Resolution of September. If they do, it will do us much harm. The funds of the Natal Indian Congress are exhausted. We are in debt to the Bank. I therefore hope that the Secretaries will make adequate efforts and collect funds.
 Mr. Chhabildas Mehta said that he could serve the community only because he had an employer such as Mr. Omar Haji Amod Zaveri. He had done no more than his duty.
 DADA OSMAN’S SPEECH
Mr. Dada Osman said:
 Omar is to me a brother and I cannot say much about him. But I do wish that many more persons like Omar were born in the Indian community. I am thankful to the Congress  for  the honour they have done me by appointing me [a  Joint  Secretary]. Of course, the Congress has yet to see—as I have yet to see—how well I serve. I shall do my best. I am heartened by Mr. Rustomjee’s arrival and I shall be proud of working with Mr. Anglia.
 ZAVERI’S REPLY
Mr. Zaveri gave a brief but impressive reply to all the addresses.
He said:
 The Indian community has overwhelmed me today by giving me a number of parties and presenting me addresses. I have not served so well that I deserve all this. I did all that I could, as a matter of duty. I thank the community for the address presented by the Congress and say that I shall constantly think of [public] service. Many gentlemen have expressed their good wishes that I may return from my Haj pilgrimage soon. God willing, I shall perform that duty soon indeed. I thank the Memon Committee for their address. I have done nothing much for them. I do not deserve an address from the Library at all. It really functions owing to Mr. Motilal Dewan’s efforts A man  following  a straight path never loses his way. I have endeavoured to serve my community in this manner and hope to do so in the future.

374,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 
 ‘‘THE PLAGUE’’
 A calamity as great as plague has now befallen the Indian community. On Friday—after my last letter was sent—a cable was received saying that the Imperial Government had assented to the act, which will mean slavery for Indians. Every one is asking: what can
 avail us now? But patriotic Indians, as they put the question, immediately realize that this is not an Act designed for our enslavement, but for the loosening of our chains. For we must not submit to it, but go to gaol instead. Looking at things this way, we should treat it as a blessing that the Act has been passed.
 ENCOUNTER WITH “THE STAR""
 Just as a dying {lame burns the brighter, there ensued a duel with The Star when the Act was about to be passed. The Star published an article inciting the people against Indians, which was replied to by Mr. Gandhi.libtech_478_footnoteAfterwards he met the editor of the paper and had a long talk with him. The Star then wrote another article which can be considered very polite, but the paper did not drop the quarrel. It said that Indians wanted the Government to trust them, and this could not be done. Mr. Gandhi wrote once again in replylibtech_479_footnote, saying that there was no question of trusting the Indian community for all time. It asked to be trusted only this once, and that for a brief period. He made many other points besides. But there may not be enough space in Indian Opinion this week to publish translations of all of them. I would, therefore, recommend the interested reader to read them in full in the English section; the entire letter is good and worth the reading. A vivid picture can be had from it of the kind of struggle going on between the whites and Indians, and of its significance. It  clearly shows that, while the Indian community wants to preserve its self- respect, the British say that we wish to kick them down. The Star’s campaign was obviously on behalf of the local Government and at its instance. Though we had very politely asked for interviews with the Rand Pioneers and the Transvaal [Municipal] Association,libtech_480_footnotethey were refused. What does this signify? Only that they treat us like dogs and care little for what we say, which they treat as mere barking. No one can now say that the Indians have not done all that was necessary for fulfilling the purpose behind the permit [legislation]. It is like pretending to be asleep while being wide awake. They know very well that the British Indian Association’s proposal of voluntary registration does fulfil the objective of the Act in relation to permits. In fact, that
 
 objective is no longer there, but the thought now uppermost in their mind is how to humiliate the Indian community. The story of the wolf and the lamb fits this Act. When the strong wolf resolved to eat up the poor lamb, he began looking for a pretext for doing so. He blamed the lamb for muddying the water which he, the wolf, was to drink. When the lamb pointed out that he had really been drinking the water down stream, the wolf replied, “If it is not you, then it must have been your father who did that.” So saying, he ate up the lamb. There is not the slightest difference between our plight and that of the lamb in the fable. They wish somehow to show that, even outside the field of politics, we are not their equals. That is why they have got this law passed. Lord Elgin’s fear has proved a stronger motive than his inclination to do justice. Out of fear of the whites, he has  done  injustice to the Indians. But who can harm one whom Rama protects? I see signs that the Indian community will adhere to its gaol-going resolution, and the sight fills my heart with joy. For the present, at any rate, I feel that the passing of the law has been for us a stroke of luck. On all sides people appear filled with enthusiasm at the thought of going to gaol and making themselves happy there as in a palace.
 CURTIS
 Something else has transpired which lends much  support  to these views. Mr. Curtis, a sitting member of the local Legislative Assembly, is said to be the sole author of this law. He has written to The Times to say that the law should be regarded as having been passed to establish the doctrine that there can be no equality between the whites and the Indians. All British subjects should not be regarded as equal. In other words, they want to demonstrate our slavery by means of this law. They want to prove by it that they have  the authority and the right to deal with us in any way they choose, without caring to think whether we like it or not. In the measure in which they have obtained self-government and become free, they want to make slaves of us. The difference between slavery and freedom consists in the manner in which others deal with us. If, for the sake of a friend, master or father, I willingly perform the meanest job, I shall win greater respect, my master will think of me as a very loyal servant, and my father will regard me with affection. But if I do the same thing under compulsion, men will spit at me, think me a coward and ask why I did not kill myself instead of submitting to such slavery. The difference between our condition as it is without the law and what it
 
 would be under the law is of comparable magnitude. We may put up with being unable to enjoy any rights in regard to land, with having our trade restricted, and with the denial of certain other rights, for there is no use of actual force against us in these matters. But the law in question seeks physically to bring compulsion to bear on our persons. Just as in India some of us oppress the bhangis and force them to dress in some particular fashion and use obsequious language lest we be polluted by their proximity [sic], it has fallen to our lot to be treated like bhangis here in the Transvaal. To remind  us perpetually of this status, we are to be obliged to carry permits on our persons. When the Pope sent a similar order to the great Luther of Germany through an envoy, he consigned it to the flames in the presence of the envoy and said, “Go, tell the Pope that Luther is free from now on. Tell him of the fate of his bull.” Since that day Luther has remained immortal. Millions may want to do what Luther did, but not every one can succeed.
 REMEDY
 After reading this news-letter, many readers will want to know what we are to do now. The answer has already been supplied by Luther. We have now earned the freedom to burn  old permits, together with the new ones. Not a single person must enter the Permit Office, for the situation is really all that hopeless. Anyone asking for a permit can do so only under the new law. But if the new law is not acceptable to us, we simply cannot apply for a permit. The first thing to do therefore is to see that no Indian goes to or communicates with the Permit Office. For the rest, we are only to watch and see whatmeasures the Permit Office adopts to force us to take out new permits. They will not give Indians as yet the privilege of going to gaol. The permit regulations are yet to be framed. Then a final date will be fixed for taking out new permits. Only after that date can the doors of the prison-palace open for us. For the present, therefore, we should stay away from the Permit Office to show that we are firm and fearless and determined to implement our  Resolution.  Refugee Indians who are outside [the Colony] and do not hold permits should give up the idea of entering the Transvaal for the present. For the necessary permit can only be had under the new law and that no Indian should now ask for. I expect all Indians to have faith that the Almighty who rules over the earth has the power to grant us a living even outside the Transvaal; Further clarification can be had by
 referring to Indian Opinion, No. 17, p. 216.
 LORD ELGINS OINTMENT
 After having inflicted a cruel wound on us, Lord Elgin now seeks to heal it with an ointment of his own make. Reuter has cabled that, while replying to a question concerning the Act, it was stated by Mr. Churchill that, during his discussions with General Botha, the  latter had mentioned that the regulations under the new Act would be very liberal and would not hurt anyone’s feelings. Reuter also adds that the Members of the House of Commons received the information with applause. Only a woman in labour knows the pangs of childbirth. The Members of the House of Commons doubtless play the midwife to us. Their applause shows that they were touched because our feelings had earlier been hurt. But they applauded without realizing the significance of Mr. Churchill’s reply. Lord Elgin seems to be trying to win over children by humouring them. After the Act is passed, however liberal the regulations, our condition of slavery will remain unchanged. If we are yoked to a cart and the driver holds the reins loose, we do not for that reason cease to be cattle. What does it matter if, instead of impressions of all the ten fingers, only one finger- print were required, or even if only a signature were required instead of a fingerprint? Even so, for reasons which I have explained, we cannot submit to the Act. Though we may be given good food and comfort as slaves, these things ought not to turn our heads and make us forget our true state of slavery. We have in all humility to inform His Lordship that, as long as compulsory registration is to remain in force, we will not submit to the act, no matter what relief is granted.
 SYMPATHY FROM DURBAN
 Letters of sympathy from Indian leaders in Durban have been received at all places in the Transvaal. Our brethren in Natal have advised us to adhere to the gaol-going resolution. We should be grateful to them for this expression of sympathy. Accordingly, a telegram thanking them has already been sent in the name of the Association.

  "
375,,HEJAZ RAILWAY: SOME INTERESTING INFORMATION,"
    
 The special correspondent of The Times of India at Istanbul has reported some interesting facts about the Hejaz Railway. Here is a summary of his report. The correspondent has passed severe strictures on the railway officials, and he advises all those who wish to give money not to pay so long as the extreme corruption in the railway is not ended. He has also sent the photographs of Mr. Kidwai and Mr. Abdul Kadir, the students who had gone to Istanbul with money. We have written to the two gentlemen in order to ascertain their views and shall publish their replies when received. We cannot say how much truth there is in this report, but The Times of India has given it wide publicity—which would suggest that there is an element of truth in it.
 ORIGIN OF RAILWAY
 The man who first mooted the idea of the Hejaz Railway was the notorious Izzet Pasha, who was responsible for the slaughter of Armenians. He is one of the self-seekers who surround His Majesty the Sultan. He hails from Damascus. Few people outside  Istanbul know that the Sultan lives as a prisoner of the Syrian Pashas at Yildiz Kiosklibtech_481_footnote. Being a true Muslim, the Sultan readily approved the Hejaz Railway proposal when it was put before him. With a view to suiting everyone’s convenience, he suggested that the proposed line should connect the harbours at Jidda and Yenbo with Medina and Mecca. But his suggestion was not accepted. Izzet Pasha persuaded the Sultan to believe that, if the line were started from Jidda, the British were sure to take advantage of it. They would set up their own man as Caliph. Izzet Pasha had made his own arrangements. He had even bought some land. He was being helped by Shaikh Abu Handa. It was accordingly decided to lay the track between Damascus and Medina.
 FROM DAMASCUS TO MEDINA
 The proposed track is to extend over about 1600 miles, of which 450 miles have been covered by now. Last year the profits from this venture amounted to only £61,900. Strenuous efforts are being made to raise subscriptions, but the people of Istanbul do not trust Izzet Pasha. No one therefore contributes any money. And though all the
 
 officials are required to contribute ten days’ pay towards the expenditure on the railway, and 2d are collected on every official document also for this purpose, the result will depend entirely on collections made through appeals to the general public. It is said that Izzet Pasha has amassed much wealth. The Pasha exacts a private commission on all stores purchased. An American firm had to pay
£3,000 as commission.
 Though the laying of the first section of the line was started in 1901, even a fifth part of the track is not yet complete. Even where the line is already in use, no attention is paid to repairs, and, thanks to the inferior quality of the rails, things appear already to have fallen into a bad state. The line is altogether useless to Muslims coming from India and China. Even among the others very few use the Hejaz Railway, since no one wants to risk travelling on that line.
 INDIAN DEPUTATION
 Some time ago, a deputation of Indian students in Britain went [to Istanbul] with collections. They were well received by the Sultan. But they were not allowed to visit Damascus, although they wanted to. Their movements were watched by the secret police. And though they were awarded the Osmania medals and were otherwise well treated, the Pashas were all afraid [of them]. There are a few Indian Muslims who are in attendance on the Sultan, but they are not fully trusted. For the Pashas play upon the religious sentiments of the people for their own profit and do not want their fraud exposed.
 WORKERS
 All the work of laying the railway is done by soldiers, and yet the cost per mile [of track] has amounted to £3,720. Again, for want of sufficient equipment, the trains cannot run faster than twelve miles an hour. A former minister of the Sultan told me in the course of a conversation that no one believes that the railway will be useful. By the time the southern section is completed, the northern section will have gone out of repair; and one can reach Jidda by sea from Istanbul taking the same time as by train.
 WHAT SHOULD INDIAN MUSLIMS DO?
 The same minister told me further that my Indian friends should not pay a pie unless they can exercise the right of supervision through
 their men and unless they are assured about the laying of a line from Jidda to Mecca. Just now there is so much corruption that there is little likelihood of the railway being completed. Many of the powerful Viceroys have told the Sultan that, in the name of the railway, regular embezzlement is going on. But the agents of Izzet Pasha do not allow anybody to [function] effectively. Of the hundreds of thousands of pounds received, nearly 25 per cent have gone into the pockets of corrupt officials. Letters are received from the travelling public, in which they complain of scarcity of water, of dearth of other amenities [on the train] and of acute discomfort. Fares are also excessively high. The third-class fare from Damascus to Tebuk is £4, which works out to an anna per mile. At present Izzet Pasha is planning to build a new office for the railway in Istanbul at a cost of £50,000. This expenditure is quite unnecessary since there already exist many vacant buildings, but no one gives thought to this chaos.
 CONCLUSION
 The collections have already amounted to £25,00,000. Soldiers are being made to work at nominal wages. In five years, only 432 miles of track have been laid. The train does not run faster than twelve miles an hour. There are 16 engines, two first-class and 24 third-class carriages only. For the rest, passengers are carried in open wagons. The passengers travelling in these experience much hardship. The railway has got into the hands of cheats and swindlers The Viceroy of Hejaz had sent a telegramto the Sultan, saying that nothing could be done as long as the railway remained in the hands of predatory officials. This has proved to be true. “Hence,” says the minister, “my request to the Muslims is that they should not send any contributions so long as the robbers remain at their posts and unless a guarantee is given about their removal”.

376,"May 	11, 1907",LETTER TO “THE STAR”libtech_482_footnote,"
            TO  THE 	 EDITOR 	THE STAR 	[JOHANNESBURG] 	SIR,           JOHANNESBURG,  May 	11, 1907 
  	In your letterhead on Mr. Polak’s letter regarding the Asiatic 	Registration Act, you state that “the most bitter opponents of the 	Asiatic trader would, probably, not be sorry if the proposed passive 	resistance movement resulted in the deportation of the most 	aggressive agitators”. Unfortunately for the “bitter opponents”, 	so far I have been able to see, there exists no such provision for 	compulsory deportation, as you seem to think there is. If, 	therefore, their wish is to be satisfied, a new Act will be 	necessary to drive out of the Colony by physical compulsion those 	Indians who, in their own opinion, are doing a service to their 	country and the Empire in their struggle to retain for their 	countrymen some degree of  self-respect  and manliness. You proceed 	to add:  Freed 	from the domination of the latter, we believe the great bulk of 	British Indians lawfully domiciled in the Transvaal would soon learn 	to appreciate the greater security which the act confers upon them, 	and to recognize how much they have been misled as to the real 	effect of the new legislation. One 	  can   quite  understand  your  inability  to   enter   into   the  	feelings of British Indians. You have misread them entirely if you 	think that there is a single Indian who is likely, after the 	withdrawal of the domination (which does not exist), to appreciate 	the “greater security” conferred by the Act. In spite of my 	efforts to detect it, I have failed to trace any greater security. 	There can be no question of misleading the mass of the Indians as to 	the real effect of the new legislation. The issue is simple. 	Compulsory registration involves a special restriction on the 	personal liberty of the subject because of the colour of his skin. 	It has been put before the Indians in the Transvaal that such 	legislation amounts to a deep humiliation and a kind of    
 slavery. They have, therefore, been advised that they ought not to barter away their present comparative state of freedom for the state prescribed for them by the new legislation, no matter how tempting it may otherwise appear to be. The above is the position they will be reduced to, according to my view, under the new legislation.
 In order to avert the degrading blow, I have ventured, also, to tell them, first, that it is their duty firmly and respectfully to decline to submit themselves to re-registration under the Act; secondly, that, seeing that the Transvaal is their adopted home and that they are without any voice in the choice of their legislators, the only effective way in which they can make themselves heard is to submit to the ultimate result of a breach of the conditions of the law, namely, to prefer gaol to either re-registration or leaving the country or paying the fine; and, thirdly, that, consistently with the above attitude, they should cease to have any communication with the Permit Department, and should ask their friends and other Indians who may wish to re- enter the Transvaal not to apply for permits, either temporary or permanent, under the new law.
 If it be said that both the last-mentioned  points  distinctly advance the anti-Asiatic purpose, so be it. It merely proves what I have often said —that the struggle, on the Indian side, is not to grasp as much of the Transvaal trade as possible, but to remain in the country with dignity and self-respect, and not to sell their birthright for a mess of pottage.
 I admit, and many English friends have told me, that my advice may not be widely followed. I shall still be content if the misgivings of such friends prove to be well-founded. And, if British Indians choose to submit to the serfdom which the legislation seeks to impose on them, I can only say that we shall have deserved the Registration Act. We are undoubtedly put upon our mettle, and it remains to be seen whether, as a body, we shall rise to the occasion. I consider that the attitude above sketched is unexceptionable, and I claim for it from the brave colonists not derision but praise. But derision or praise, it will be churlish and sinful for myself and my fellow-workers to turn aside from a course which has been dictated by a conscientious purpose.
 I am, etc.,

CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 I had intended to write to you a very long letter, but was unable to do so owing to a very severe headache during the train journey. The condition continued yesterday, and today it is no better. My health seems to have been seriously affected by my exertions  in Durban this time. However, I feel confident of regaining my health through sufficient rest, earth treatment, etc.
 I have sent some matter today. I expect to write or dictate more tonight. When I heard about the balance-sheet,  it  immediately occurred to me that it was desirable—indeed it was our duty—to give Thakkar an increment without his asking for it. I believe he is very useful to us. Despite some of his bad habits, he is strong on two points: his determined patriotism and his celibacy. His work is on the whole satisfactory. I would therefore specially advise you to give him an increment immediately. When I discussed this with Maganlal, I had thought of giving him one pound, but now I think it would be enough if you gave him half a pound for the present. Maganlal had suggested to me that Miss West should also be paid something. I much appreciate that idea also and feel it better that the rest of you should think of doing so before the idea occurs to Mr. West. I would advise immediate action in regard to both these things. Do please read Ruskin’s book’libtech_483_footnote. Always think about your teaching method while giving lessons to Anandlal and Harilal and make constant improvements in it. Please give Dada Sheth the boards that he has asked for. I hope you have sent the additional copies I wrote to you about yesterday.libtech_484_footnoteChi. Hemchand will probably leave by the end of June at the latest. He is thinking of passing through Delagoa Bay. Please send me the name and address of the person who is working for us in Delagoa Bay. The list of Hindi and Tamil books has not yet
 
 been received. I hope you have sent 25 copies to Omar Sheth. Send three copies to Jagmohandaslibtech_485_footnoteafter marking them. Ask Omar Sheth if he wants more copies. Please write to him a courteous letter saying that the 25 copies are a present from the Press. Do always send a complimentary copy to the Volksrust Public Reading-Room. I am writing to Chi. Jayashanker asking him to have our name included in the Indian Directory.
 Blessings from

MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,
 I enclose herewith order for the Germiston Sanatan Dharma Sabha, Please give the equivalent of the Hindi in English, and Gujarati also. In order to make the letter-heads appear artistic, you will have to use your judgement as to how they should be printed. What I think is that you could have the English in the form of an arch, and underneath the arch you could have the Hindi and Gujarati equivalent[s] in parallel columns. This is with reference to the title of the Sabha. The address will follow in the three languages, one after the other. The top with the mystic syllable “Om” may appear only in Hindi. It should be on ruled paper, 500 foolscap and 500 Banklibtech_487_footnote. I have told them that it will be about 25/- for the whole order, but, if it is more, let it be more. Send your bill to the Sabha, Box 33, Germiston, at the same time that you send the letter-heads. In printing the addresses, you are not to give the box.
 I have written to Osman Ahmed. I have not by me the extract from The Times of India, as I have sent it to London. The Malays of Johannesburg do speak Dutch, the same as oflibtech_488_footnoteCachalia’s order, but very few of them are capable of reading the language. Why do you want to know it?

Please pay up the money due to Kalyandas and take a receipt.
 The £46 have been correctly credited to his account. It was no trouble bringing the parcels as the guard was known to me. He was no doubt critical.
 Please continue the arrangement with Bhikhubhai for  some  time. I hope you have attended to Mr. Polak’s telegram.

 MY DEAR CHHAGANLAL,
 I have your letter. I think I threw off the headache on Thursday, but, though I am feeling much better, I do not want to give myself over much work yet. The treatment I gave myself was two local earth bandages and two abdominal bandages, and rest up to seven o’clock in the morning, instead of six. The real thing was as much rest at night as possible.
 I am glad you have decided to adopt my suggestion with regard to increase in extra copies. I shall ask Hemchand to send you a list of the number of copies sold this week. Many, I know, are still left, but that does not matter. How many extra copies did you sell on your side? Hemchand must go home, because I do not want to apply for an extension of his permit as it would fall under the new law; and as I have advised them to do likewise, to be consistent, I must not get an extension for Hemchand. Hemchand thinks he will save a little money by going through Delagoa Bay, and see the place also. At the same time, if there is any reason why he should go through Durban, he will do so.
 With reference to the block, I propose to charge the Association for it. That being so, I have told you that copies of the supplement should not be sold by themselves, nor should you advertise them for sale, as you advertise other supplements. If we sell those supplements, we can only credit the Association with the amount, which is hardly
 worth while. The Advertiser article is simply contemptible.
 You know how to treat the vaccination marks. If not, you should look up Dr. Tribhowan’s book, which is, I believe, with you.
 I shall try to secure names for the Directory here. You may take out the advertisement of E. Ebrahim of Standerton. I do not despair of collecting the amount. I am glad you have written to Mr. Omar for his contributions. You may write again, offering niore copies if he needs them.
 
       [PS.]         I am sending very 	little matter today.  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI "
382,,ANOTHER SOUTH AFRICAN INDIAN BARRISTER,"
    From 	a photostat of the typewritten original with a Gujarati postscript 	in Gandhiji’s hand: S. N. 4751           	We had occasion to congratulate Mr. Joseph Royeppen and his 	relatives on the former’s having graduated at Cambridge. We have 	now the pleasure of congratulating them on Mr. Royeppen’s having 	passed his Bar Final examination. He may now be in our midst any 	day. That would bring up the total of Indian barristers practising 	here to four. In our opinion, the usefulness of the  liberal  	education  received by them can be measured only in so far as they 	use it for the advancement of their countrymen. Of all the countries 	in the world, perhaps India today, whether within her own borders or 	outside, has the greatest need of the talents possessed by her sons, 	and we hold that, before Indians who have received a liberal 	education’s can make such public use thereof, they will have to 	adopt voluntary poverty. Indeed, we are not sure that it is not the 	duty of every man to limit his personal pecuniary ambition. Whether, 	however, the larger proposition can be sufficiently proved or not, 	the smaller one we have already laid down is indisputable. Apart 	from the work of securing ordinary civil rights for their countrymen 	in South Africa, Indians like Mr.  Royeppen can do a vast amount of 	useful and quiet work in the way of internal and social reform. We 	place before them the self- 
 sacrificing example of the late Mr. Manomohan Ghose and the late Mr. Kalicharan Banerjilibtech_489_footnote, both of them brilliant lawyers, who not only placed their legal ability at the disposal of their countrymen, but also their riches.

There are 	deeds that may not be tarried,  	Doubts, fears ever abound, and courage is harried; They waste the 	days saying the time is not yet— No such excuse ever did bring 	profit.  	By plunging in and savouring success is strength found. Raise the 	cry and take the plunge, for victory’s around. Through 	adventure did Columbus to the New World make his    	Through adventure did Napoleon have enemies in his grip; Through 	adventure Martin Luther did the Pope defy; Through adventure did 	Scott his debts re-pay;  	Through adventure did Alexander have his name resound. Raise the cry 	and take the plunge, for victory’s around. Thus 	sang the poetlibtech_490_footnote. 	The song deserves to be learnt off by heart 
  	by every Indian, especially in the Transvaal. Let him grasp its  	meaning in full, and then plunge into the fight, regardless of 	consequences. The more we think about the Transvaal Act, the more we 	feel that it is to be shunned like a viper. The spirit of enterprise 	is essential for this. As the poet puts it, this matter brooks no 	delay, and fear is likely to sap our courage. Let us, then, have no 	fear. As the Gujarati saying has it, doubt is like a ghost and 	selfishness like a witch. Accordingly, if we go on having doubts, 	there will be no end to them.     
 Once free from doubt, we shall win resounding success in the end. Whatever the excuse offered by anyone, believe it to arise from fear. Let every Indian expel the witch of fear and resolve that, whatever others might do, he for his part would go to gaol rather than submit to the new Act. If that happens, we shall see in the end that no Indian will be cowardly enough to take out a new permit. Columbus kept up his courage even when his sailors, one and all, threatened his life. That is how he discovered America and became famous throughout  the  world. Napoleon, a youth from the island of Corsica, shook  all  Europe. Hundreds of thousands of men did his bidding. When the Pope sent Luther the bull of excommunication, he tore it up and became free. The great poet Scott proved himself a man of his word, despite old age, and went on writing, earning enough to pay off his debts. Everyone has heard of Alexander’s Empire. With  such examples before them, how can the Transvaal Indians lose heart even in the smallest degree? Letters have continued to pour in, which show that the writers would never go back on the pledge taken  in  September. However, if the Indian community breaks that pledge and retracts, this is what we think the future holds for us.
 If the Indian community takes out the permits which are compulsory under the new Act, then in a short time
 the 	trade licences in 	the Transvaal will be discontinued;  almost 	all the Indians 	will be 	required to 	live and 	carry on 	their trade 	in Locations;  the 	Malay Location will be lost to us and its present residents will be 	required to 	go to Klipspruit; all hope of getting land rights will have to be given up; the 	foot-path regulation 	will be applied 	to Indians;  many 	more of the 	trade licences in 	Natal will 	be cancelled 	next year; and  a 	Registration Act 	like the one in the 	Transvaal will 	be introduced 	throughout South Africa. 
 What Indian would care to live in South Africa under these circumstances?
 We do not guarantee that all the rights referred to above will be secured if the new Act is opposed. There is, however, a possibility of at least some of them being granted. But whether we get them or not, the
 world will certainly recognize that the Indian community has vindicated its honour and the Transvaal Government will realize that the Indian community cannot be insulted with impunity. One’s good name must not be sacrificed, whatever the cost. The good name of the Indian community will then have been saved.

 "
384,,LADYSMITH STRUGGLE,"
    
 
 There has been a fresh defeat for Indians in the matter of licences, and this calls for second thoughts. The Ladysmith struggle is to be treated as part of the struggle all over the Transvaal. We hope that no Indian will wind up his business. In the Transvaal an Indian not taking out a permit will go to gaol; but it is not so in Natal. For, according to the [Dealers’] Licenses Act, one can only be fined for carrying on business without a licence. There is no provision for imprisonment in default of fine. This appears confusing at first sight, in fact there is no confusion here. If the fine imposed under the Act for trading without a licence is not paid, the Government will have the right to recover it by attaching and selling the shopkeeper’s stocks. This is not the time for people to be afraid of such things. Only when we allow our goods to be sold in this manner will the eyes of the Government be opened to the magnitude of the oppression inflicted on us. As for the situation in Ladysmith, we know that the Govern- ment itself is displeased with the Ladysmith regulation. Very likely no one will be prosecuted. But things will become difficult if what happened at Ladysmith today happens elsewhere. Just as we must show courage [at the prospect] of going to gaol, so must we show courage and face [a possible] confiscation of our goods. Here too we can point to the example of Englishmen themselves. When two years ago the Education Act was enforced in England, many people were reluctant to pay the Education Cess. There was only one way of collesting the tax from those who refused to pay it: that was to attach and sell their goods. Those who were displeased by the tax refused to pay it and allowed their goods to be sold, with the result that the Act is about to be repealed. In our opinion, the same course has to be taken if the licence menace becomes serious and no redress can be had by
 other means. While adopting this course, we should ensure that the shops and houses of Indian traders and their account books are all kept in order. We also hold that, if the Indian community in the Transvaal makes good its pledge, it will have good results in Natal too.

385,,GAME OF CHESS,"
    
 When the news of the passing of the new Act was received, The Star published a forceful cartoon. It shows the whites and the Indians playing a game of chess. With the permission of The Star, we reproduce the cartoon elsewhere with our own cartoon in reply. According to The Star, the black king has mounted an attack on the Transvaal rook. The white knight; if it can enter the Ordinance square, will be in a position to check the black king. Now that the Bill has become law, the white knight can move into the Ordinance square and force the black king into the Indian square. The white knight is pleased.
 In the cartoon which we publish in reply, it is shown that the square of the gaol-going resolution is occupied by a black pawn. The white knight in its hurry has overlooked the black pawn which guards the Ordinance square and the fact that it cannot move into the Ordinance square as long as the black pawn is on the gaol-square. It is further suggested that what in its blind hurry the white knight takes to be the black king is really not a king; it can only be a poor pawn.
 The Star has attached so much importance to the Ordinance. It has charged the Indians with overrunning the Transvaal. All this shows that the new Act is not a trivial matter. We commend this drawing to every Indian for careful study.

 "
386,,BOYCOTTING PERMIT OFFICE,"
    
 The boycott was first started by the Chinese last year. We have seen the effects it has had. The Transvaal Indians, and other Indians
 wishing to enter the Transvaal, need not go to such lengths as the Chinese, but they should support the resolution on gaol-going, for implementing which it is necessary to suspend all business with the Permit Office. In Durban, no Indian should go to Mr. Burgess’s  office. In Pretoria likewise, no Indian should go to the Permit Office, or enter into any correspondence with it. It can be readily seen that, if we do not accept the new Ordinance, we cannot now go anywhere near the Permit Office, since all applications to the Permit Office made now will be treated as having been made under the new Act. We must not remain inactive on the ground that the new Act is not yet published in the Gazette. We were glad to learn that Mr. Mahomed Cassim Anglia, who had applied for a permit, intends to withdraw his application. Mr. Osman Ahmed intends to do the same. This news should fill us with enthusiasm. Every Indian should do the same. Now, considering the matter carefully, what can we gain by having anything to do with the Permit Office? What difference will it make [to our situation] if three or four Indians are able to enter the Transvaal [as a result of our dealings with the Permit Office]? And what harm will be done if they cannot? We hope that in view of the damage that is likely to be done to [the interests of the] entire Indian community if any business is done with that Office, every Indian will boycott it, as suggested by the British Indian Association.
 On reflection, we think that young Indians, and others who have anything to do with the Permit Office, should break off all relations with it, and persuade others to do likewise. A couple of men can stand near the Office entrance by turns and if anyone wishes to go in, dissuade him from doing so.

 "
387,,WHAT IS EDUCATION?,"
    
 
 In Western countries education is so highly valued that senior teachers are treated with much respect. There are at present  in  England schools that have been running for hundreds of years and have turned out many renowned men. One of these famous schools is Eton. A few months ago the Old Boys of Eton presented an address to the Head Master, Dr. Weir, who is well known throughout the British
 Empire. Writing about the occasion, The Pall Mall Gazette, a well- known journal in England, has explained the nature of real education. Its comments deserve the attention of us all- The writer in The Pall Mall Gazette says:
 We hold that real education does not consist merely in acquainting oneself with ancient or modern books. It consists in the habits which one knowingly or unknowingly imbibes from the atmosphere, one’s surroundings and the company one keeps and above all in work. It is all very well to acquire a stock of knowledge from good books or from other sources. But the more important thing is to learn humanity. The primary function of teachers is, therefore, not to teach the alphabet, but to inculcate humanity. Aristotle said that virtue is not learnt by reading big volumes. It is by doing good deeds that we learn virtue. Another great writer also says that it is well for one to know what isgood, but one will be considered a happy person only if one Acts upon that knowledge.
 Judged by these standards, English schools will not be found wanting. If we think of English schools as places for turning out human beings, we shall see that they give us statesmen and administrators. Those educated in German schools may have greater knowledge, but if they become also men of action like the pupils of Eton, it is not by virtue of their training in the schools. Despite the defects that may exist in English schools, it is these that produce true men. They are men who are ever ready to meet an enemy threatening at the gates of England.
 We can readily realize how a country that invests education with such a noble purpose becomes prosperous. India’s star will shine bright when Indian children receive such education. Parents, teachers and pupils ought to ponder over the passage quoted above. It would not do merely to know it, it is necessary to Act upon it. That is to say, parents should provide for excellent education, teachers should discharge their responsibility and pupils should recognize that mere literacy is not education.

388,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 MIRACLE OF GAOL-GOING
 In the Transvaal and, if I am not mistaken, all over South Africa, Indians are discussing the gaol-going resolution. They feel certain that the Transvaal Indians will court imprisonment. Some say that gaol is a palace; others look upon it as a beautiful garden. Yet others consider it paradise. Again there are some who think that gaol will prove to be a key which will unshackle the Indians. Some others hold that, through the gaol gates, we shall pass from our present bondage to freedom. Thus in their several ways, people have shown enthusiasm about going to gaol. There are also some who, when the enthusiasm wanes, start worrying about what will happen to this person or that, and get into a panic. I have received a few letters of this kind and the questions they raise do deserve not to be rejected out of hand. For if we are to achieve success in the end, we should provide for the difficulties that are being felt. Indian Opinion as well as  the Association has received some letters to this effect. I reply to them all in this letter and, on behalf of the Association, I apologize to the writers for its inability to answer them individually. I do not refer to the writers by name as this is unnecessary.
 WHAT SHOULD TRADERS DO?
 An Indian writes that his shop is run by him and his son, and that he has debts to pay. What should they do if they are both arrested? To this question there can be many answers. First, let me give the one that comes readily to mind.
 Reply 1. Going to gaol is a great adventure, which will benefit not only the person concerned; but all the Transvaal Indians and, in fact, the Indian community as a whole. To win such great benefits, one must put up with whatever loss may occur. I believe that going to gaol will please Khuda or Ishwar. The Creator always helps us in anything we do in fear of Him. We reap the fruit of our labour in proportion to our faith in Him. The Prophet Mahomed and his disciples were once in a cave. A whole army was marching towards them. The disciples cried out in fear: “O Prophet! We are only three, and the army consists of hundreds of men. How shall we save ourselves?” The Prophet replied, “We are not just three. God, Who is a match for all, is
 also with us.” It was owing to such superhuman faith that the Prophet succeeded in all that he attempted. The enemy could not do him the least harm. They passed the cave by; it did not occur to them even to look in. Likewise, if we turn to the Hindu scriptures, we find Prahlad, a steadfast devotee of God, who remained unharmed even when made to embrace a red-hot pillar, because he too had unshakable faith  in God’s help. In the same way, for an Indian who undertakes this adventure with Khuda as witness, there is nothing more to think about. The great God, the protector of the faithful and the preserver of their honour, is present everywhere and at all times. This reply implies reliance on fate. But, as we know, fate without human effort is of no avail. Hence, we need to think of other things too.
 Reply 2. While thinking of human effort, we have always to bear the first reply in mind. For those who cannot fully and sincerely trust in God, there is a remedy indicated by Mr. Coovadia: that is, even if all the men working in a shop are arrested simultaneously, they should go to gaol. After returning from gaol, someone-—not the proprietor of the shop—might take out a permit (not with the  intention of obeying the law, but with that of getting it repealed) and run the shop. Every person will thus come out of gaol well trained.
 Reply 3. If anyone finds it difficult to Act up  to  Reply  2, permits for all persons other than the proprietor of the shop may be taken out on the last day fixed in the Gazette for the purpose.
 Reply 4. The reader will remember what I said earlier: before it becomes necessary for an Indian to go to gaol, he will receive a notice to quit the Transvaal.libtech_491_footnoteHe will be arrested after the expiry of the notice period, then sentenced to pay a fine and to imprisonment in case of default. One must then go to gaol instead of paying the fine. It will thus be possible for the trader, during the notice-period, to make over his goods to his creditors. For the small trader this will be the best remedy. He is unlikely to find any difficulty in earning his daily bread after release from gaol.
 WHAT OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN?
 The Act gives [the Government] no power to arrest women, and children under sixteen. They will thus have to suffer nothing more
 
 
 
 than separation from husband or father. As for their maintenance, the answer has already been given that the Indian community will look after them. It is to be remembered that all the  thirteen  thousand Indians will not have to go to gaol at the same time. If, however, this should happen, our deliverance would be immediate. Since all the Indians will not be going to gaol at the same time, there will always be a few people outside to look after one another.
 WHAT  IS  A VALID PERMIT?
 A correspondent has raised a further query. Anyone who has obtained a permit after making a true affidavit and whose permit bears his signature or thumb-impression is the holder of a valid permit, irrespective of whether or not he is a refugee. Only these [that is, holders of valid permits] are to live on in the Transvaal and court imprisonment.
 WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MEN IN SMALL VILLAGES?
 This question has been asked by a correspondent from Belfast. The answer to this is contained for the most part in the foregoing replies. If, however, the villages come in for attack first, Mr. Gandhi will very probably rush there. Even if he happens to be busy in  another part of the Transvaal, the people need not at all be afraid. When an officer comes to investigate, whatever permit one holds should be shown to him. He should be told that taking out a new permit is humiliating to us and that it would never happen. If he asks for any finger-prints other than the thumb-impression, these should be flatly refused. If a notice is served on anyone, information should be immediately sent to the Association with particulars, such as name, address, etc. On the expiry of the notice period, he should appear before the court and accept whatever gaol sentence is awarded. If a fine is imposed, it should not be paid. It is necessary that every Indian everywhere should communicate these instructions to those who may not know about them.
 BOYS OVER SIXTEEN
 Questions on this subject have been asked from Petersburg. No boy, as long as he is under sixteen, will be arrested. Boys who are over sixteen, whether or not they hold permits or other documents, are in the same situation as the holders of valid permits.
 WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO EXISTING PERMITS?
 A correspondent from Lindleyspoort seeks to know what will happen to those who hold permits now, but go to India on business
 while the struggle is on, and then wish to return. He asks whether their permits will hold good then. For those who are preparing to go to gaol, this question will not arise. For no one can tell what the end of the struggle will be. However, generally speaking, the reply to this question is that such a permit-holder will probably find no difficulty in returning.
 HOW TO ACT DURING POLICE INVESTIGATION
 A correspondent from Volkstroom asks: what are the police to be told when they come to investigate? What is to be done if the police forcibly take away the permits? The answer to these questions is only this: produce the permit when they come. If required, give one thumb impression only. If asked to take out new permits, refuse to do so, and say that you have no intention at all of taking out one, and that, if, for not doing so, the Government sends you to gaol, you will be ready for it. The police do not have the authority to take away permits by force. Therefore, if they threaten you in any way, reply boldly that you will not give up the permit. If any such thing happens, report it to the Association.
 The same person also inquires what arrangements will be made for the dependants of those who go to gaol according to the Fourth Resolution, and whether the Association will pay the counsel’s fees, etc. Answers to these questions have already been given above.
 CURTIS’S LETTER
 Mr. Curtis has addressed a letter to The Times of London. A comment on it has already appeared in this journal.libtech_492_footnoteThe whole letter is reproduced in The Star. It is not necessary to offer a translation of it, as most of the facts in it are a matter of history. There are, however, some points in the letter that deserve to be noted. For Mr. Curtis is a member of the Council, and importance will always be attached to his statements. Every Indian will therefore have to think about the matter. Mr. Curtis says:
(I) that Englishmen and Indians ought never to have equal rights;
  that 	the law which has 	been enacted lays 	down quite properly that 	their rights are 	not equal  that 	this law is onlt 	the beginning 	of a series 	of many 	similar laws to 	come; and 
 
 
  that 	Lord Selborne’s 	promise that 	no new 	Indian would 	be  allowed into the 	Transvaal should be honoured. 
 Mr. Curtis goes on to make other points, but those mentioned above are sufficient to put the Indian community on its guard. The letter shows that the Transvaal Act is intended not merely to provide for registration, but to humiliate us also, to show that we are not their [the whites’] equals in any way, and to brand us as slaves. From the letter one thing at least becomes certain: if the Act comes into force, and if we submit to it, instead of fresh rights being granted to us, we shall be deprived of what little remains to us, not merely in the Transvaal, but all over South Africa. We shall, therefore, do well to remember what kind of law this is. It will be better for every worthy son of India to leave the Colony or commit suicide than to submit to a law with such dire consequences. Mr. Polak, the editor of this journal, has given Mr. Curtis a biting and powerful reply. There is no time for translating it here. But it may be read in the English section.
 WELL DONE, STANDERTON!
 The Indian community in Standerton has been carrying on a vigorous campaign against the new Act. A correspondent of The Star went there to interview the local leaders. They told him plainly that Indians thought nothing of the hardships of imprisonment as compared to those that would result from submission to the new Act. They were well prepared to resist it, and had even raised funds for the purpose; but they would never submit to it. I hope that, following the example of Standerton, every Indian everywhere will boldly give the same  reply. Now that we are on the battle-field, we have nothing to fear and nothing to hide.
 THREAT BY “THE STAR”
 The editor of The Star was somewhat piqued that the Klerksdorp Indians should have held a meeting about gaol-going. Mr. Polak therefore replied to him that not only in Klerksdorp but in Germiston and other places also such meetings had been held and that news was coming in from all over concerning the gaol-going resolution. This has enraged the editor all the more. He has said in his comment that there were only a few leaders who were inciting the Indiancommunity, and that, if they were deported, the other Indians would not utter a word but would cheerfully accept the new Act. Mr. Gandhi has replied to him as follows:
 GANDHI’S REPLYlibtech_493_footnote
 
 You say in your leaderette that those who oppose the Indians would not be sorry if their leaders were deported. But I ought to point out to such opponents that there is no law authorizing the Government forcibly to deport anyone. If that is to be done, another law will have to be passed. Then the Transvaal Government will be able to deport those Indians who are ready to serve their country and even the government. You say that, if the leaders are deported, the remaining Indians will obey the Act. They will then realize how the Act protects them and how they had been misled about it. It is readily seen that, in saying this, you cannot appreciate the feelings of Indians. You are mistaken if you think that there is a single Indian who takes the Act as being meant for his protection. I have repeatedly gone through the Act without coming across any section which might protect Indians. Moreover, there can be no question of misleading any Indians in this regard for what has been placed before them is a very simple matter: the new Act only insults Indians by branding them as slaves. In several ways the Act reduces Indians to the position of slaves since it is an attack on them as a community.
 They have therefore been advised not to forego in any circumstances the existing rights by submitting to the new Act. If the new Act comes into force, I believe that the Indian community will be reduced to that position.
 To ward off this deadly blow, I have advised people to do three things as under:
 They 	should not take 	out new registers.  As 	the Indians 	residing in the 	Transvaal have 	no right 	to vote, 	the resolution about 	going to gaol 	is the 	only means they have to 	oppose any particular 	law. They should not 	take out 	a permit, 	nor leave 	the country, 	nor pay a 	fine; the 	only straightforward and 	effective course 	for them is 	to go to gaol.  If 	they do 	this, they 	should have 	nothing to 	do with the 	Permit Office, 	and should 	also write to 	their friends 	to persuade 	them not to ask for new permits, 	whether temporary or permanent. 
 
 If anyone should say that, by doing so, they would be doing just what the whites wanted, let the whites think so. This will prove what I have always said, viz., that the Indian community is not out to save its trade in the Transvaal, but to stay here with honour. The Indian community will not sacrifice its good name just for the sake of a living.
Many English friends have told me—and I myself believe that
 —that not all Indians will perhaps accept this advice. Even so, I have no fear. I can only say that in that case we deserve the Act. It is certain that we are now being put to the test. It remains to be seen whether we stand it well or not.
 I assert that no one can have anything to say against the position as set out above. Instead of looking down upon it, the brave colonists should admire our stand. But I think it to be a degrading and sinful thing to turn away from the path that we have chosen with  true sincerity without caring whether others admire or condemn.

390,,MEETING OF BRITISH INDIAN ASSOCIATION,"
    
 A meeting of the [executive Committee of the] British Indian Association was held on Saturday the 11th. It was presided over by Mr. Essop Mian, and was attended by Mr. Coovadia, Mr. Kazi of Krugersdorp, Mr. Nagadi of Warmbaths, Mr. Suleman Ahmed, Imam
 Abdul Kadir, Mr. A. A. Pillay, Mr. Bhikha Ratanji, Mr. A. M. Bhayat, Mr. A. M. Aswat, Mr. Ameeruddin, Mr. Suleman Ibrahim Bhayat of Rustenburg, Mr. Naidu, Mr. Cachalia of Pretoria, Mr. A. M. Gatu, Mr. Alibhai Akuji, Mr. Omarji Saleji, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Bomanshah and others.
 Mr. Gandhi told the meeting of the help received from Durban and answered many questions. He then added: “The present time is so critical that every Indian, without depending on what others do and irrespective of it, must Act upon the resolution on gaol-going for the sake of his honour and for the sake of his country. In both Durban and Pretoria, no one should have anything to do with the Permit Office. No one should enter [the Colony] with a new permit.
 Mr. Coovadia made a powerful speech and moved the following resolution: The Honorary Secretary should write to people everywhere, asking them to stop having any dealings with the Permit Office Telegrams should be sent to Bombay and other places to say that those intending to go to the Transvaal should give up their plans for the time being. No one should give all the ten finger-impressions. Meetings should be held at all the places and people should be asked to refuse to submit to the new Ordinance.
 The resolution was supported by Mr. Aswat and passed unanimously. Concluding the deliberations, Mr. Essop Mian said:
 No one should be afraid of acting upon the resolution on gaolgoing. Going to gaol is for us like receiving an honour. We should not become dupes of our temptation that, if we submit to the new Ordinance, we shall get a few rights in return. Lord Milner and other officials made many promises, none of which was kept. That shows that we can win nothing unless we exert ourselves and give proof of our courage.

391,,THE TRANSVAAL STRUGGLE,"
    
 Why should you suffer taunts, my brother? To be cowardly is a disgrace.
Suffer not insult; death is far better.
 The pain of death comes only once; Disgrace brings unending  pain, And every finger will point at you. Early death with fame is gain,
 And this the noble soul doth love. A base thing it is to live for long
 A lingering life of pain and shame. Wealth may return that once has gone; Forever gone are honour and name.
 The loss of honour brings in its train Miseries untold and threefold pain.
 Letters received by us prove that today the Indian community in the Transvaal can think of nothing to talk about but the new Act. This is a matter for rejoicing. True to this spirit, we too will continue our discussion of the subject. Last week we quoted a poem by the great heroic poetlibtech_494_footnoteof Gujarat. Another poem by him charged with the heroic spirit is printed above. The poet has shown vividly how it is a disgraceful thing to suffer taunts. Honour once lost cannot be recovered, as wealth or other things, if lost, can be. Moreover, the poet asserts that the loss of honour results in threefold suffering—of mind, of body, and poverty.
 His Majesty Amir Habibullah has set an example of how respect can be won and maintained. His Majesty visited Lady Minto’s fair, where he bought a few things. The person in charge of the sales was the daughter of a nobleman. In making the bill, she wrote “His Highness the Amir” against the buyer’s name The Amir returned it to the lady, saying that there was a mistake in it. The poor lady wondered what it could be. She checked up the total and politely said that there was no mistake. The Amir shook his head and handed back the bill. Nervously, she went over the bill again and, finding nothing wrong, requested him to point out the mistake. The Amir informed her through his attendants, “The Amir is now not just ‘His Highness’, but ‘His Majesty’.”
This incident has an important lesson. It shows how the Amir
 
 had become conscious of his dignity and we can say that from that day the Afghan people came into light. To be sure, even in maintaining one’s honour, one has to be careful. If a conceited upstart should seek undeserved honour, we would ignore him as an impertinent person. His Majesty seized the right occasion. It was at a function like Lady Minto’s fair that he reminded the lady of his title. Thus all the world knew about it. The lady had styled him “His Highness” out of ignorance but now no person or nation can show disrespect to him, intentionally or unintentionally.
 Similarly, the Indian community in the Transvaal is now faced with the question of its dignity. If it shows courage now, all it has suffered till today will be put down to its good sense. If it submits to the Act this time, it will no longer be taken as good manners, but as baseness and cowardice. For every nation, as for every individual, there are occasions when honour has to be fought for. The Transvaal Indians are now faced with such a situation. The whites were caught unawares but now wonder whether Indians have enough courage to face imprisonment. It is our repeated appeal to the Indian community that all the thirteen thousand Indians should with one voice proclaim the answer, “Yes, yes and yes.” Cowards die many times, the valiant only once A cable from India says that, within six weeks, the plague took a toll of 4,51,892 lives. Instead of dying in such agony, what would it matter if an equal number had to die for the sake of their country? Is there anything that India could not achieve if Indians came forward in such large numbers to die for theircountry? But in the Transvaal, we are not faced with a comparable situation. All that needs to be done is to have courage to go to gaol and suffer a minor hardship. Is there any Indian who will shrink from this?

392,,STRUGGLE FOR FRANCHISE IN ESTCOURT,"
    
 
 Indians in Estcourt had claimed the right to vote at municipal elections, and the claim has been rejected by the Magistrate on the ground that, under the new [Natal] Municipal ACT, an Indian who does not enjoy the right to vote at political elections cannot have the municipal franchise either, that is, the rights of citizenship. This
 judgement is altogether wrong. The Municipal Act has not yet been passed, and our fight against it is still going on. It is obvious that the Magistrate at Estcourt does not read this journal, although he gets it free. Otherwise he would not have given such a wrong judgement under an act which has not yet received the approval of the Imperial Government. It is now essential that Estcourt Indians make an appeal.
 Having considered the matter carefully, we want to say that Estcourt Indians ought not to have taken this step without the approval of the Natal Indian Congress. This is not the time when any one section of the Indian community can act independently of the others. There are many grievances [Indians have] in Natal. It is imperative to put up a fight. If in the course of this struggle, a mistake is made even in one town, it may prove detrimental to the interests of the whole community. We believe that there was no need of such precipitate action in the matter of the municipal franchise. Efforts are  being made to have the Bill—now being discussed in Britain—disallowed. The Estcourt case is likely to have an adverse effect [on our efforts]. We are now in a dilemma. If the case is dropped, we  shall  be  disgraced; if on the other hand we go on with it and the  final judgement is adverse, the act may receive [Imperial] assent. What difference does it make whether a few Indians get the vote or not? The right [to municipal franchise] must not be lost, because the loss of that right will degrade us. On the other hand, there is no indignity in desisting from the exercise of a right which we have. We hope that the Indian community, at all places in Natal, will profit from this incident and not take any steps without consulting the Congress. At the same time, we repeat that the appeal in the Estcourt case should be  proceeded with. Natal Indians should remember that, if they wish to assert their claim to the municipal franchise, they should pay up the rates before the month is out.

393,,CHURCHILL’S SPEECH,"
    
 
 Speaking on the Colonial Conference, Mr. Churchill has declared that the people of South Africa have the freedom to make whatever laws they wish relating to Kaffirs and Asiatic immigration.
 That means that the Colonies in South Africa have complete powers to regulate Asiatic immigration. All that will remain for the Imperial Government to do is occasionally to take a look at laws relating to Indians now residing in South Africa. But the new Transvaal Ordinance does not relate to immigration. And though it applies to the Indians already living there, the Imperial Government has given its assent to it. It follows from this that the local governments in South Africa will be able to attack the Indian community with impunity. The only weapon with which to ward off the attack is our resolution on gaol-going. As in the saying, ‘there is no help like self-help, no water like that of rain’, everything depends on our own strength and courage. Even by the road that we have taken we shall in the end arrive at the resolution on gaol-going; so far-sighted is the resolution and so obvious are its advantages.

394,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 
 NEW ACT
 Last week I replied to a number of questions.libtech_495_footnoteBut more  questions are being received. Most of these have been answered earlier. However, let me here answer them again, and I  may  be excused any repetition by those who have clearly followed earlier replies. The reader is requested to keep the previous number handy for reference.
 WHAT DOES FREE DEFENCE BY GANDHI MEAN?
 There have been many inquiries in this regard. Let me clarify the matter further. If anyone is prosecuted under the new Act, and if t he person concerned holds a valid permit or is otherwise entitled to reside in the Transvaal, Mr. Gandhi will defend him in the court free of charge. If the case is to be heard outside Johannesburg, the Association will pay Mr. Gandhi’s railway fare; but if the place he is required to visit has made no contribution to the British Indian Association [funds] already, the Association will collect the dues. The
 
 
 defence will be in respect of the permit and the Government’s refusal to issue a licencelibtech_496_footnotewhen a new permit has not been taken out. That is, if a person does not hold a licence and is therefore arrested, he will not be defended free of charge. But a person who has been refused a licence for having failed to take out a new permit will be defended free of charge. The result of it will be that the person will ultimately have to go to gaol. Mr. Gandhi will not, with or without fees, defend those who do not desire a gaol sentence. A reference to  the  last number of Indian Opinionlibtech_497_footnotewill show in what manner the defence will be put forward. We recently heard that permits were being examined. If this is true, it is not being done under the new Act. If therefore anyone is arrested following such examination, he will  not  be defended free of charge. It has to be remembered that the case should fall under the new Act.
 
 WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BY PERSONS GOING TO DELAGOA BAY?
 An Indian going to Delagoa Bay is required to obtain a pass from the Portuguese Consul and has often to visit even the Permit Office. The question has arisen whether such a person should seek the aid of the Permit Office. It is obvious that, even in this case, no one should do so. But no one can prevent a person from travelling to DeIagoa Bay. If at all the Portuguese Government should do so, he can always go via Durban, but he should not approach the Permit Office. However, the matter is being enquired into and I shall give more information later. Going to the Permit Office, however, is out of the question whatever happens.
 WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BY PERSONS RETURNING FROM DELAGOA BAY?
 It is reported that, at Delagoa Bay, an Indian has to produce a pass from the British Consul before a railway ticket can be sold to him. I believe that this practice is illegal. The remedy lies in the hands of the Delagoa Bay Indians themselves. But what applies to Durban applies to Delagoa Bay also. That is to say, no one is at present to take
 
 out new permits. Holders of old permits may come in only if they are prepared to go to gaol. Otherwise the best course will be not to enter the Transvaal for the present.
 CAN ONE LEAVE THE TRANSVAAL?
 A correspondent has asked whether an Indian who now leaves the Transvaal can return later, say, in June. According to the new Act, an Indian will, in this situation, have to take out a new permit. If he does not, he will have to go to gaol. Those, therefore, who have overcome the fear of imprisonment can boldly return. Those who are afraid had better stay out. If you are brave, you may come and go without fear.
 WHEN ARE SHOPS TO BE CLOSED FOR THE DAY?
 This question does not arise out of the Act. A letter from Machadodorp says that the police in the town require the Indian traders to close their shops early. If the police are doing this, it is illegal. But my advice to all Indian traders is that they should everywhere close their shops at the same time as the whites. We need not wait for legal compulsion. There is no doubt though that the necessary law will be passed in a few months. Municipalities have already been empowered to frame such bye-laws. Grace lies in doing a thing before we are forced to do it.
 WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT TEMPORARY PERMITS?
 This question and a few others arising from it have been raised by a correspondent. I know that some temporary permits expire at the end of June. My advice is that the holders of  temporary  permits should leave the Transvaal before the expiry of the permit period. To the very end, it is essential to show that our struggle rests on truth alone. Those who are in the Transvaal by right ought to defend their honour stubbornly. I can think only of two exceptions in relation to this reply—the Imam of a mosque and the Hindu Shastri. These two have come in for imparting religious instruction. Had the new Act not come into force, they would have had no difficulty in getting permits for a further period. Now they cannot take out new permits, but they can prolong their stay after duly informing the Government—but only with the intention of going to gaol. They can argue that they neither carry on a trade nor have they a share in anyone’s income and that their sole function is to impart religious instruction  to  their people. They cannot, therefore, leave. This argument does not,
 
 however, apply to private persons who are here for business reasons. They may well be prepared to prove their courage by going to gaol, but I have to tell them respectfully that they may not enjoy  the privilege of imprisonment.
 Holders of temporary permits do not have the  rights  of refugees. They had come here for a temporary period and, at the end of it, are bound honestly to leave. If such temporary permit-holders desire to serve the country, they can remain outside the Transvaal, dedicate themselves to the service of the country, and go about telling other Indians of the miseries of the Transvaal Indians. They can thus render much service to the community as and when the occasion arises. He who wants to be of use will always have the opportunity, wherever he may be at the moment and in whatever condition.
 AND OF OTHERS WHO ENTERED WITHOUT PERMITS AND OBTAINED THEM LATER
 Some Indians entered without permits when in the beginning they were free to do so. Later, such persons were granted Resident passes, in exchange for which they eventually obtained permits. A correspondent inquires about the validity of these permits. The reply is that all such permits are valid. He also wants to know what orders will be passed in such cases. This question results from ignorance How can anyone order those who are determined to have nothing to do with the Permit Office? They are free and they will go to gaol to defend their freedom.
 “GO TO GAOL”
 I have received some letters containing exhortations to Indians to go to gaol. I am not sending these for publication. Today we need men who are themselves prepared to go to gaol. If they go to gaol themselves, there will be no need to advise others to do so; if one is not prepared to go to gaol, one’s advice can have no effect on others. To those who have made this appeal my plea is that they should write and tell us what they propose to do themselves, so that their names can be published in the English and Gujarati sections of this journal.
 WARNING TO HAWKERS
 Regulations have been framed for hawkers all  over  the Transvaal, of which the following is a summary:
 A person carrying his goods in a wagon will be treated as a hawker, one who goes about on foot will be regarded as a
 pedlar. The pedlar may have a wheelbarrow. The licence fee for a hawker is £5 10s and for a pedlar £5. In his application, every hawker should state his residential address and inform the authorities of any subsequent change in it. On his barrow or on his pack, the hawker or the pedlar, as the case may be, should display the words ‘Licensed Hawker for  Johannesburg Municipal Area’. Likewise, the room where the hawker’s or pedlar’s wares are stored should also display his name and the words [of the notice] If he issues any  hand-bills,  these  too should bear these particulars No person can make over his licence to another, except when a servant who has  been employed for hawking wares is relieved and another person engaged in his stead, the original license may, with the permission of the municipality, be made over to the new servant. A hawker may not stay at the same place for more than 20 minutes for purposes of his business, and he may not visit-the same place more than once in the course of a day. Hawking is prohibited on mining ground. A hawker cannot take his wares out of his barrow for display as in a shop. Garden produce can be sold by the grower or his servant without a licence, and in such a case the said regulations do not apply.
 Regulations to this effect have been framed for the Johannes burg municipal area, and they will probably receive the Governor’s sanction in a week or two. These regulations mean that no person with a hawking licence can stay at the same place. The President Street Market will henceforth be closed [to hawkers], that is, persons doing business there will need to have a shopkeeper’s licence.
 The regulations are of course harsh, but as they apply equally to whites and non-whites, nothing can be done about them. Similar regulations have been framed by the Krugersdorp municipality also. In effect, the municipality frankly says that, since most of the licence holders are Indians, there is no harm in making the regulations astringent as possible.
 TRAMWAY REGULATIONS
 At last, the tramway matter has been decided. The regulations which were opposed by the British Indian Association have now been passed and published in the Gazette. There are some good points about them. For example, the phrase “Coloured person” does not
 include an Asiatic. The regulations cover other points besides, some of which are dealt with below:
 The Town Council has the right to reserve any tram-car or any part of it for Europeans or Asiatics or Coloured persons. The Council has the authority to grant special permission to any person to travel by any tram-car. The servants accompanying white children can travel by all tram-cars. A servant is allowed to travel with his master by any tram-car that the master is authorized to use. The Council is bound to provide reasonable facilities for travellers of all classes.
 Two points in these regulations deserve to be noted. One is that the servants of whites, however dark, can travel by the same car as their masters. The other is that, according to Section 20,  dogs  can  be carried in the car meant for the whites, provide the conductor does not object. In other words, unlike dogs and black servants, a free Indian will not be free to travel by a tram-car of his choice unless a special permit has been obtained by him for that purpose. In reply to this, one may point out that the whites cannot travel in cars meant for the blacks either. The only difference, however is that, while the whites are ranked with the Queen Mother, Coloured persons and Indians are treated like the youngest housewife in the village. My advice is that, under such humiliating conditions, no one should ask for a permit. It all depends on us whether or not we continue to be treated as the youngest housewife in the village.
 LOCATIONS
 From the current issue of the Gazette, I find that the Locations at Christiana, Heidelberg, Potgietersrust, Rustenburg and Volkstroom have been made over to their respective municipalities. Locations at Roossenekal, Leysdorp, Amersfoort and other places have been closed down.
 WASHERMEN AT NEW CLARE
 The editor of this journal has sent to The Sunday Times a reply to its attack on the New Clare washermen.libtech_498_footnoteThe reply shows that the accusations made in The Sunday Times by “Mr. Volture” were all false. The editor claims that the water flowing from the spring is not dirty. The water used for washing is changed twice a day. Indian washermen do not get their work done on a contract basis. Their
 
 houses are clean, and everything in them has been inspected by the municipality. Indian washermen hold certificates of efficiency from well-known Europeans. The editor has accordingly asked for an apology from the correspondent who wrote in The Sunday Times. In reply to this, the editor of The Sunday Times writes that the arguments of the editor of Indian Opinion are weighty and  convincing.  He wishes to publish a reply, but that “Mr. Volture” is ill and his reply may take a week or two. This shows that, for the present at any rate, The Sunday Times has suffered a defeat. For the information of those who may not know it, I should say that “Mr. Volture” is a pseud- onym. It means vulture, the bird of prey. This human vulture had meant to eat up the Indian washermen, but it will not be wrong to say that for the present they have been rescued from its clutches by the editor of Indian Opinion.
 BRAVE RITCH
 A cable has been published in the newspapers here to say that Mr. Ritch has addressed a letter to the well-known paper, The Times. Therein he has smashed Mr: Curtis’s argumentlibtech_499_footnote. He has put forward a strong argument in defence of the Indian community and shown how Mr. Chamney’s Report is really in our favour. Mr. Ritch has been doing invaluable work. Day and night his mind is engaged in the same thought. He misses no opportunity of pleading our cause. Well- educated Indians should follow his example. It might be said that no one else would do as much work even if we paid him four times as much as Mr. Ritch receives from the Committee.

 THE CHINESE AS PASSIVE RESISTERS
 ...On Sunday last, at the hall of the Transvaal Chinese Association, a large and representative meeting was held to consider the next step to be taken with regard to the new anti-Asiatic law. Mr. Quinn, Chairman of the Cantonese Club, presided, and the meeting was addressed by Mr. M. K. Gandhi, who had been specially invited to set forth the position. This he did, briefly and succinctly, pointing out that...the new law did not add to the security of those Asiatics [who were] rightly in the Transvaal, as had been so often alleged by the anti-Asiatic party and echoed by the uninformed general public, but really took away all their existing personal liberty, guaranteed under solemn Imperial pledges, substituting a restricted liberty, which no self-respecting subject of a civilized country could possibly accept...the only dignified defence of their rights that the Asiatics in the Transvaal could make was to ignore the compulsory clauses entailing re-registration, and submit themselves to the extreme penalty of the law, namely, liability to imprisonment; as  also to boycott the Permit Office. libtech_501_footnote

          [TO  THE 	EDITOR 	THE STAR JOHANNESBURG]  SIR,               JOHANNESBURG,  May 	30, 1907 
  	The arrival of General Botha and the fact that the Asiatic 	Registration Act, though it has received the Royal sanction, is 	still the subject-matter of correspondence between the Imperial 	Government     
 and the local Government, encourage me to appeal once more to your good sense and, through you, to that of the colonists. Now that the anti-Asiatic party has obtained what it wanted, is it impossible to arrive at a reasonable compromise and to save British Indians from being considered untrustworthy and feloniously inclined? the Act is not yet gazetted, and it need not be until the Government wishes to do so. I, therefore, suggest that, before it is gazetted, a form for new permits may be mutually agreed upon, and, in accordance with it, Indians and other Asiatics may be registered afresh in exchange for proper documents they may possess. If, then, all Asiatics thus voluntarily surrender their documents, there can be no occasion for submitting them to the degradation contemplated by the Act. If, however, there are Asiatics in the Colony who do not surrender their documents, the Act can be immediately gazetted, and be made applicable, by a short Bill, to them. Thus, those who are bona fide holders of permits and are honest will be automatically separated from those who are guilty.
 I do not know whether you can see any flaw in this proposal, unless you think that the object of the legislation is not that illicit traffic in permits may be stopped, but that it is to, openly and boldly, put an unwarranted affront upon British Indians and other Asiatics. Let me remind you, before any such declaration is made, of Lord Ampthill's remarks:
 This is not a matter which only touches our honour. We are pledged to our fellow-citizens in India—pledged by the solemn declaration of the Sovereign, by the pronouncements of our statesmen, and by all that is implied in the whole method of our administration of that great dominion—to treat the people of India as fellow-citizens in every sense of the word. We invite them  to be proud of their citizenship of the Empire. We tell them, again and again, that there is nothing to prevent their rising to the same positions as are held by Englishmen in India, and we imply, in all that we do for them and say to them, that, whenever they are under the British flag in any part of the world, they will be treated as British citizens.
Lord Lansdowne feels so keenly the humiliation in which British
 statesmen are placed by this Act that he questions whether to wound the susceptibilities of the whole Indian nation is not more injurious and imprudent than to allow the surreptitious entry of a few Indians into the country. But the proposal I have ventured to sketch above is just as effective against surreptitious: entry as may be by [sic] the Asiatic Act.

  "
397,,JURIES ON TRIAL,"
    
 
 Ever since the birth of this journal, it has studiously restricted itself to questions affecting Indians in South Africa. We consider that, however desirable other questions may be from a journalistic stand- point, we must recognize our own limitations and not enter into questions of high policy, or questions that do not  directly  affect Indians in this country.
 But there are exceptions to every rule. We feel we should be false to our profession, if we did not deal with the now celebrated Mtonga caselibtech_502_footnotelibtech_503_footnote, which has attracted so much attention. It rises from the platform of Native policy to that of humanity and, to a certain extent, the principle underlying it is applicable to Indians also. We, therefore, gladly make room for an extract from the extremely well-reasoned and humane leading article from the columns of The Natal Mercury. It constitutes an indictment of the jury system in particular when applicable to trials between whites and blacks. We join with our contemporary in its repudiation of the charge of the special ill- treatment of Natives levelled against Natal in some quarters and based on the abortion of justice in the Mtonga case. We believe that what happened in Natal is likely to happen, under similar circumsta-nces, in any part of South Africa, or in any country conditioned as South Africa is. Natal, no more than any other country, can claim a  monopoly of jurymen fired with passion and prejudice, but the fact that instances like the Mtonga case happen in South Africa  must waken the public conscience, and make those who are jealous of the reputation of South Africa seriously consider whether the time has not arrived to revise our ideas about the jury system. In a place like South Africa, where there is no leisured class and where people of all nationalities congregate, the jury system is about the worst that could be devised in connection with the administration of justice. The inherent condition of success of trial by jury is that the accused is tried by his equals. It is an insult to man’s intelligence to contend that
 
 
 there is any such trial in South Africa, when the question is as between whites and blacks.
 When passions are roused, men who are not trained to examine facts and apply a well-balanced mind to the matters before  them cannot possibly arrive at a just conclusion. Even in a well-settled and old place like Liverpool, possessing a homogeneous population with traditions to go by, it required a judge of the calibre of the late Justice Stephen to secure a verdict at the trial of Mrs. Haybrick. How is it possible, then, to get any satisfaction out of jurymen in a place like South Africa, where different nationalities are still in the melting pot, and a South African nation has yet to rise in the dim and distant future? We are no worshippers of the idol of equality, when there is no foundation for it. It is possible that any attempt to abolish the jury system, in cases where there are whites and blacks concerned, will be met by the cry of false equality. We hold that any Native or Coloured man who takes up a position of that description does not know real equality. All that can reasonably be claimed, today, by or for them is equality in the eye of the law. White people from different parts of Europe, who come to South Africa with no notion of Imperialism, cannot be expected either to think of Imperial obligations or other notions of justice and equal rights as between themselves and others whom they hold to be inferior, save from the dictates of whatever humanity there may be in them.
 We hope, therefore, that no Coloured man or Asiatic, because our argument applies equally to Asiatics as to other Coloured people, will think of opposing the movement that the Natal Press has, from purely disinterested and just motives, inaugurated for the abolition of trial by jury in cases where there are European and Coloured people concerned. It would, indeed, be the best thing if trial by jury were abolished altogether, but it is such a time-honoured superstition that one can hardly expect public opinion to reject it altogether, nor will it be possible to make out a strong case against the institution so far as it may apply to whites only.
 We believe that, if the matter is left where the Press has left it, no result will be achieved. The churches in South Africa are rightly supposed to be the custodians of the interests, we will not call them the rights, of the Natives in South Africa, and, though the immediate question has arisen in Natal, we feel that there should be among the
 
 churches a simultaneous movement and a petition to the respective South African Governments for the complete abolition of trial by jury in cases as between white and Coloured men. We think, also, that such a movement on the part of the churches should be very widely supported by the Natives and the Coloured communities of South Africa.

 "
398,,WHAT SHOULD THE BRAVE DO?,"
    
 
March forward, losing no time;
 Delay not, putting off the task from day to day. The more you think, the greater will appear  The obstructions in the path.
 “How can I break the loving bond of home? What will happen to my people?”
 So enslaved by domestic bonds, How will he rush to battle?
 As we pause and think, and think and pause, All too suddenly the enemy descends on us. Overwhelmed with fear and trembling,
To defend ourselves is a job.
Digging a well when the flames rage high—
 This is but growing wise after the mischief is done, To try and put up a bund when the floods begin. How can it help?
Take up arms, and march together,
Spear in hand, roaring a challenge to the foe.
 The new Transvaal law is still lowering and thundering. As the proverb goes, a thunderstorm seldom means rain and barking dogs seldom bite. But this new law will burst indeed, just as much as it thunders. It will be gazetted as soon as General Bothalibtech_504_footnotereturns from England. Let us, therefore, give further thought to the challenge that
 
 we have offered to that law through the gaol resolutionlibtech_505_footnotelibtech_506_footnote.
 We can see from the poem quoted at the top of this article that, when we are about to embark on an adventure; it is useless to go on thinking of the consequences. Those rushing to a battle-field do not think of what will happen to their family or business. The Indian people have always placed their trust in God alone. Before that God we took an oath and resolved not to submit to the new law. The proper time to think was before the Resolution was passed, and, indeed, we did think then. But now the time for thought is gone. Now is the time to be firm in our resolve. Sheikh Saadilibtech_507_footnotesays in  Gulistan that, if man were to think of the Giver of his daily bread quite as much as he does of his bread, his place in heaven would doubtless be higher even thanthat of the angels.In the same way, we have now to complete the task we have taken up, thinking not of our bread, our family and our business, but of Him who preserves all and is the cause of their progress. Even if everyone forsakes us, so long as we go on doing our work, trusting the Master who lives in the hearts of us all, He will never forsake us.
 Let us take the example of our rulers. When the Boers crossed swords with the mighty British, the late Mr. Krugerlibtech_508_footnotedid not think of his family or wealth. General Joubert fell fighting. General Smutslibtech_509_footnote, too, fought desperately. Dr. Krauselibtech_510_footnotesuffered imprisonment for two years and all his property at Johannesburg was ruined. Mr. De Villiers, who now heads the Department of Justice, was thrown into prison. He received bullet wounds in his leg. General Botha fought to the very last. The Boer women too endured many hardships with quiet strength and gave courage to their sons and husbands. The result is that now the Boers have secured what belongs to them.
 We know what the English themselves have always done. John Hampdenlibtech_511_footnotefreed the people from their hardships and was ruined
 
 
 in the process. Lord Colin Campbelllibtech_512_footnotehad just returned from China thoroughly worn out; but no sooner was an order given to him, in 1858, than he left again. He did not enjoy even an hour’s rest. Eight near relatives of Lord George Hamiltonlibtech_513_footnoteoffered themselves for ser- vice in the Boer War. The son of the late Prime Minister, Lord Sali- sburylibtech_514_footnote, was in Mafekinglibtech_515_footnoteduring the   siege.  The  only  son  of  Lord Robertslibtech_516_footnotelost his life in the battle, and today Lord Roberts has no male heir.
 As compared with these examples, the task before the Transvaal Indians is a small affair. They do not have to oppose a Government or to take up arms. They have only to go to gaol and put up with some trouble, or at the most suffer some loss of business. Shall we be afraid to do this? We on our part have been hoping that the Indian community will not be afraid of doing even more. “Fear God alone; then there is no need to fear anyone else”—this is what all the scriptures teach us.

399,,A PRIZE OF £1,"
    
 
 The title of this note is “A Prize”, but the reader is not to think mainly of the prize. For Indians today it is the season of the new law and the gaol resolution. Hence, any Indian who sends us the finest poem in Gujarati or Hindustani (Urdu or Hindi) composed by him in support of the gaol resolution will be awarded a prize as above. We hope that no one who is used to writing poetry will fail to compete. The poem should be sent not so much for the prize as for the honour. The following are the conditions for the competition:
 
“Tyler, Hampden and Bunyan”, 20-10-1906.
 “Speech at Calcutta Meeting”, 19-1-1902.
  The 	poem should not 	exceed 20 lines. The 	words should be simple. Though 	 there  is 	 no 	  restriction  on 	  the  ragalibtech_517_footnotelibtech_518_footnote,  the  metre

400,,UNREST IN INDIA,"
    
 Many exciting things are happening in all parts of the world. We hear people everywhere speaking of “Our Country”. The people of Egypt proclaim, “Egypt for Egyptians”. The Chinese have massacred many Europeans in Hong Kong. The negroes declare, “We should have our rights.” Self-government has been established in Iran. Afghanistan has grown strong. And now India. There too we hear the thunderous cry of “India for Indians”. Towards this end, efforts are in progress everywhere to bring together Hindus and Muslims. In the Punjab, a Muslim has started a paper named Hindu-Muslim, and he urges the two communities to become united. From the other side, agitation is being carried on by papers like Bande  Mataram  for ending British rule. The proceedings against the Punjabee led to
 
 riotous demonstrations in which prominent Indians took part. Some of them were arrested. Some will be deported from the country, and some will be imprisoned. Highly educated gentlemen like Lala Lajpat Railibtech_521_footnotewere among those involved. The question should naturally arise as to what we should do at such a time. Though we can do nothing, thoughtful men should consider what attitude they should adopt.
 Should the British be thrown out of India? Can it be done, even if we wish to do so? To these two questions we can reply that we stand to lose by ending British rule and that, even if we wanted to, India is not in a position to end it. By this we do not suggest that the British Raj is very powerful and that India has had incalculable advantages from it, or that India could not, if it so willed, remove British rule. But we hold that, whatever the motives of the British in coming to India, we have much to learn from them. They are a brave and considerate people, and are on the whole honest. Blind where self-interest is concerned, they give unstinted admiration for  bravery  wherever found. They are a powerful nation, and India enjoys not a little protection under them. It is not, therefore, desirable that British rule in India should disappear.
 Should we then repudiate such men as Lala Lajpat Rai? That, too, is not possible. In our view, the men of the Punjab and the others who carry on the agitation are brave men. They are patriots and  endure hardships for the sake of the country. To that extent they command our respect. However, they appear to be in error in so far as they want to eliminate British rule. In pursuit of this end, they appear determined to suffer any punishment the law may inflict on them. We have nothing to blame them for. For, their sufferings will lead to India’s happiness. They oppose British rule because of its drawbacks. Because of that rule, India is becoming poorer. To some extent, British rule is an important cause of even the plague in India. It adds to the ill-will between Hindus and Muslims. It is also because of that rule that we have been reduced to such a low state and live like cowards. Exasperated by these evils, some Indian leaders find fault with the entire British nation. Their revolt will probably remove these draw-backs to some extent. Moreover, since they are our own fellow- countrymen, we ought not to nurse ill feeling against them. Rather, we
 
 
 ought to admire their heroism.
 The fault, in fact, lies with us. If we remove the fault, British rule, which is a cause of misery today, can become a source of happiness. Public spirit is not likely to grow among us without western education and contacts with the West. If that spirit grows, the British may grant our demands even without a fight, and may leave India if we want them to do so. The British colonies are what they are, not because the people there are white, but because they are brave and would take offence if their rights were not granted. That is why they are regarded as members of one family.
 In short, we have no quarrel with British rule. We have to be proud of the courage of those who have been creating this unrest. Let us show the same courage ourselves, but instead of desiring the end of British rule, let us aspire to be as able and spirited as the Colonists are, and demand and secure the rights we want. And at the same time, let us learn and follow the good points of British rule, and so become more capable.

 "
401,,INDIAN PRINCES,"
    
 
His Majesty the late Amir Abdur Rahmanlibtech_522_footnotelibtech_523_footnotehas said:
 During my visit I saw one sorry sight which affected my mind very much. The dress of the poor Indian princes resembled that of women. They had diamond pins in their hair, pendants in their ears, bands on their wrists, gold chains round their necks, and other ornaments such as women wear. Their trouserbelts were studded with jewels and the pendants, hanging from their waistribbons, almost reached their feet. Theyallowed in ignorance, indolence and luxury. They little knew what was happening in the world or what it contained. They passed their time in consuming wine and opium. They believed that their status would be lowered if they went on foot.
This is, for the most part, a true picture. It can be said that there
 
 
 are Indian princes who do not live in this manner. But we are not concerned with them at the moment. The fact is that the state of affairs described above is one powerful cause of our miserable plight.
 It is not only the princes that live in such a base manner. Among the people also this state of things is seen often enough. Our comment mainly refers to the Hindus in India. The so-called big men and their children are mostly recognized by the marks vividly described by the late Amir. Luxuries, ornaments, garments of silk or brocade—these are seen to be quite common with them. If the so-called modern people do not wear ornaments, etc., they satisfy their desire in other ways. It is no use blaming any one section for this. Customs coming down from ancient times die hard.
 But we Indians in South Africa have to learn the lesson that all of us, big or small, should free ourselves from these faults. The condition of our country and of ourselves is so unsatisfactory that, at present, we are in a state of continuous mourning. How can we enjoy comfort or pleasure, when every week thousands of our countrymen die of plague or starvation? We are convinced that it is necessary for every Indian to colour his mind with the yellow of a monk’s robe. His outfit should display none of the evils of jewellery, silk, gold, etc.
 KING OF ENGLAND
 Our London Letter in this issue lends weighty support to what we have said above. King-Emperor Edward’s grandson is 13 years old today. From now on he is being made to go through a rigorous training. The Prince is required to study at school with other boys and he will be served the same simple food that the others get. A people ruled over by such a King does what the King does. Is it any wonder that such a people are prosperous? We are not to envy them, but to become like them. Let it not be argued that they, too, have their pleasures and luxuries. Such a thought bespeaks indolence. They  enjoy themselves after their work is done, and their luxuries become them well enough. Even so, we are not to imitate their weakness for a life of pleasure and comfort. Like the swanlibtech_524_footnotelibtech_525_footnote, we should separate good from evil.

 NEW LAW: MORE QUESTIONS
 Questions about this law are still coming in. I am glad of it, and all questions so received will be dealt with in this journal.
 WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BY THOSE HOLDING DUTCH REGISTERS?
 According to the notice in the Gazette, an Indian has made an application to the Permit Office on the basis of his registerlibtech_527_footnote. In that connection, Mr. Mahomed Daoji Patel from Wakkerstroom makes the following enquiries:
  Can 	it be taken 	as a 	certainty that 	the application will 	be accepted 	by the Permit Office?  If 	it is accepted, should 	the applicant 	withdraw it, since 	it violates 	the Fourth Resolution?  In 	case the application 	is withdrawn, 	will the police 	arrest him?  If 	he is arrested and 	the magistrate orders 	him to 	leave the 	Transvaal, what is he to do?  If 	on his acting thus a case is instituted against him, will Mr. 	Gandhi come 	here to defend him? 
 The answers are: Neither this man nor anyone else in his  situation need withdraw the application so long as the new law has not been gazetted. And it is also unnecessary now to proceed in the matter of the said application. The application will have to be withdrawn as soon as the new law is gazetted. If the matter comes up before the magistrate, the said applicant or others in his position who a rightful holders of registers will be defended by Mr. Gandhi. As for the nature of the defence, please refer to earlier news-letters. The boycott of the Permit Office means that henceforth we shall have nothing to do with that Office. The cases of the Transvaal residents that may be pending in that Office need not be withdrawn. That step is to be taken immediately after the law is gazetted.
 
 WHAT IF MR. GANDHI IS SENT TO GAOL FIRST?
 A correspondent asks what is to be done for defence if Mr. Gandhi is imprisoned first. It is a relevant question. But one mustknow what the defence by Mr. Gandhi is going to be. The defence will only state that it was upon his advice that people had taken the  firm decision to go to gaol, and that he (Mr. Gandhi), therefore, deserved to be sentenced first. If such a defence by him is  rendered unnecessary and he is straight away taken to gaol first, the defence would have already been made. The main aim of Mr. Gandhi’s presence is to keep up the courage of the accused. People will have nothing to fear if, fortunately for the community and for Mr. Gandhi, he is sent to gaol first. Even while in gaol, Mr. Gandhi can put up a defence, that is, he can pray to God to give courage to all Indians. At this stage, I should also add that it is mainly because the new law is humiliating that all Indians accept the gaol resolution. Thus, the only conclusion is that every Indian must maintain his self-respect.
 WHERE ARE FUNDS TO SUPPORT WOMEN AND CHILDREN?
 The person raising this question asks how maintenance can be provided when the Association’s funds are meagre. The law has not yet been gazetted. As soon as it is, leaders will visit every place to explain matters to the people and raise contributions.  Moreover, leaders in Natal and East London have already communicated their willingness to help. It has also been arranged that if Mr. Gandhi should be imprisoned, Mr. Polak, the editor of Indian Opinion, will go from place to place collecting funds, encouraging people and explaining the position to them. Some whites also have indicated their willingness to help.
 GERMISTON LOCATION
 Passes, like those of the Kaffirslibtech_528_footnotelibtech_529_footnote, used to be issued to Indians at the Germiston Location. In this connection, the British Indian Association had addressed a letter to the local Government and to this a reply has been received stating that such passes would not be issued in future. Those living in the Locations may, therefore, get their passes framed and keep them as exhibits. If they are asked again to take out
 
 such passes, it will be their duty not to do so; they can give a plain
`no’ in reply.
 STRIKE OF MINE LABOURERS
 We have been talking of boycotting the Permit Office and going to gaol. The white labourers in the mines have struck work with a view to getting higher wages. The result was that in about ten mines work came to a standstill. Everyone knows that these miners live from hand to mouth. Some of them are married. For the sake of their rights, they have walked out of the mines, giving up their present income, without bothering about their families and their means of livelihood. There is no question of their self-respect having been wounded. Yet, for the sake of what they believe to be their right, they have girded up theirloins against the authorities and the fabulously rich mine-owners. Whether their demands are reasonable or not need not be considered just now. On this occasion, it is their spirit and their daring that we are to think of and emulate.
 ENCOURAGEMENT PROM EAST LONDON AND KIMBERLEY’S WRONG VIEW
 The President of the Association has received a letter of sympathy from the Indians of East London. Mr. A. G. Ismail hopes that all Indians will remain firm in disobeying the law and will go to gaol. He also says that help will be sent from there. On the other hand, there is a telegram from Kimberley expressing sympathy but asking the Indian community to think well before taking the step of going to gaol. This is a wrong view. The Indian community believes in God, and will not trifle with Him. Moreover, it was after mature deliberation that the gaol resolution was passed in September. It is the duty of every Indian, therefore, to give us, residents of the Transvaal, full encouragement and to pray to God to sustain our courage at the time of our real test.
 INDIANS IN GERMAN EAST AFRICA
 The Star correspondent in England states in a cable that, at a meeting of the German Colonial Society in Germany, some members said that Indian merchants in German East Africa harmed the interests of small European traders. The Indians cheated the Kaffirs. It was they who incited the rebellion. Therefore, laws like those enacted against them in South Africa should be enacted in  German  East Africa, too. The Society’s committee has reported that, though it was
 
 possible to level some charges against the Indian traders, their presence in the land had on the whole proved to be an advantage. It was likely that any attempt to make a law for deporting them would lead to complications with England. Some other members who were acquainted with the situation prevailing in the Colony defended the Indian traders.
 PENALTY FOR GIVING FALSE EVIDENCE
 A washerman named Ponnusami was put up before Sir William Smith for giving false evidence. Ponnusami had made unfounded allegations against other Indians who, he knew, were innocent. The jury found Ponnusami guilty. The judge sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for 18 months. Those Indians who are not afraid of giving false evidence should take a warning from this case.
 MOVEMENT TO CLOSE SHOPS AT FIXED HOUR
 A proposal for the closing of shops at a fixed hour was discussed in the Johannesburg Town Council on the 22nd [May]. Owing to the many divergent views expressed at the meeting, the members could not agree on a solution. They therefore  decided thatthe whole matter should go to the Parliament for decision. The Council’s proposal was also forwarded to the Parliament at the same time. The proposal provides in effect that ordinarily shops should close at 6 p.m., on Wednesdays at I p.m. and on Saturdays at .9 p.m. On holidays they should remain closed altogether. When shops are closed, the hawkers too should stop going on their rounds. The law to this effect has not yet been passed, but one may take it that it is about to be. The Indian who concedes the need for early closure of shops and acts accordingly of his own free will, will find himself at an advantage over others.
 LAND TAX IN JOHANNESBURG
The tax on land is fixed this time at a penny and a quarter per
 £100. The tax will be calculated for the period from January 1, 1907 to June 30, 1907, and will be due on June 24, 1907. Those who fail to pay it by that date will have to pay interest at the monthly rate of one pound per £100.
 CHINESE MEETING AND GAOL RESOLUTION
 Last Sunday a meeting of the Chinese Association was held in its hall. About 300 Chinese, mostly merchants, were present. Mr. M. Quinn   took   the   chair.   Mr.   Gandhi   also   attended   by   invitation.libtech_530_footnoteExplaining the position, he said that the Chinese and the Indians had been classed together under the new law. The law humiliated the Asiatics and it should not therefore be accepted by the Chinese. The various questions that are answered in this letter were all raised and answered at the meeting. In the end, it was decided that every Chinese should declare on oath, in accordance with his religion, that in no case would he take out a new permit and that, if necessary, he would be prepared to face imprisonment.
 PERMIT CASE
 A permit case has been going on for some days past against an Indian named Lala. It came up for hearing on the 27th before Mr. Wenderburg. Superintendent Vernon deposed as follows:
 I have the power to ask for permits from people. It is also my duty to investigate the rights of people who want to enter with permits. On April 20, I saw Lala near my office, and he said to me, “I wish to work with you. Many men desire to take out permits. If you supply me information about them, both of us will make much money. I shall charge everyone £20 of which I shall give you £8. There are many Indians and Chinese here with false permits. If you get their permits set right, I shall pay you £20. Here is a permit; put yourinitials on it and pass it. That way you will earn £400 a month, and I £200. Mr. Harris too will get £200. My information is that irregular forms are current in Johannesburg and that many Indians are without permits.”  Then I asked him to come again the following day. He did come, and after some talk with him, I rang the bell and got him arrested. As he was being taken to the Charge Office, Lala said, “Sir, you have missed a golden opportunity of  making money.”
 Constable Harris also deposed as above. Mr. Chamneylibtech_531_footnotelibtech_532_footnote, giving evidence,. said:
 
 
 My duty is to scrutinize all applications for permits. A permit would be very rarely granted if the police report were unfavourable. My decision in the matter would be final, though the Governor has the power to alter it. The applications of  Indians are placed by me before the Colonial Secretary. Lala came to me twice. He said that some Indians had false permits. Once I had allowed him to come by rail without a ticket, as he said that he would give me some information. But he brought none.In his deposition, Lala said:
 An Indian approached me for a permit I said “no” to him. Then he showed me a permit which was not in order. Thereupon, I went to Mr. Chamney and told him that the man had to pay £30 for the permit. Mr. Chamney asked me to take the man to his office. Then I went to Mr. Vernon and offered him money so as to be able to give information  to  Mr. Chamney. My intention was to know how false permits were being issued, for I was likely to get a reward for giving infor- mation about them. I am a loyal subject of His Majesty the King-Emperor and had hoped that for my loyalty I would get a Government job. No definite amount had been fixed. Harris had said that one Indian had agreed to pay £100. Before I had made up my mind, I was arrested.
 The Public Prosecutor asked Lala questions about a letter received from Pretoria. Lala replied that the letter had not been correctly translated. Mr. Thompson, therefore, asked for a week’s  time again and the case was adjourned to June 4.

403,,SERVANTS OF INDIA,"
    
 An Indian savant has written in The Indian  Sociologist  proposing the establishment of a society of servants of India. We give here a summary of what he has said.
 That India should become united and independent is an idea that many Indians now understand and cherish. But the moral energy needed to achieve this aim is wanting. Those who would serve their country should first realize that one’s life is not to be spent in pampering oneself with easy living, but that it is to be used in doing

 one’s duty. The population of India comprises one-fifth of the world’s population. The task of promoting its uplift belongs to “the servants of India”. These servants are the trustees of the  Indian people. They should give up the desire for wealth, status and physical comforts, and dedicate their lives to India. Fear of every kind must be overcome. Such service should be regarded as part of one’s religion. Men of such patriotism will be able to imbue the people with enthusiasm by their actions rather than by their words.
 Besides ardour, knowledge and wisdom will also be required. Hence “the Servants of India” should know the history of India. They should understand what India needs now. They should also study the history of other countries.
 This enthusiasm and knowledge cannot remain fresh for long in a man burdened with the responsibilities of a family. A true servant will need to observe total celibacy. Those who are married but wish to render service to the country can train the members of their families to take up the same kind of work. Indian women are ignorant. It is very necessary to awaken patriotism in them. But those, who are not married and wish to render service as explained above will find it best not to marry. The great patriot Mazzinilibtech_533_footnotelibtech_534_footnoteused to say that it was to his country that he was married.
 In conclusion, he who wants to be a servant of the people needs faith. He should not worry as to where he would get his next meal from. God will provide for all His creatures.

 THE SECRETARY TO
 RIGHT HON’BLE THE PRIME MINISTER PRETORIA
 SIR,
 As the Asiatic Registration Act is still the subject of correspondence between the Imperial Government and the local Government, I have been directed by my Association to seek an interview with the Prime Minister in order to submit to him a proposal which might obviate the necessity of gazetting the Act. In any case, my Association would be deeply grateful, should General Botha find time to receive the deputation on behalf of my Association before any further steps are taken in connection with the Act.
 I shall, therefore, be obliged if you will kindly ascertain whether and when it will be suitable for the Prime Minister to receive a small deputation on behalf of my Association.libtech_538_footnote
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servant ESSOP ISMAIL MIA ACTING CHAIRMAN,

406,,HONEST VIEWS,"
    
 We are glad that Mr. C. P. Robinson, M. L. A., has been telling his constituents some home truths, and has not hesitated to handle an unpopular subject in the right spirit. Mr. Robinson is of opinion that
 
 the practice of the Licensing Officers in discriminating between Indian applicants and others to the disadvantage of the former is reprehensible and unjust, especially when it is a matter of existing trade rights. Mr. Robinson also thinks that, if the Colony wishes to deal with the Indian question, it should do so in a straightforward, bold and honest manner. We congratulate him on having ranged himself so honourably on the side of justice and equity. If all our legislators would adopt the same bold attitude, the Colony would soon rid itself of a great deal of cant and hypocrisy.

407,,THE CAPE IMMIGRATION ACT,"
    
 We draw attention to the gruesome story a correspondent from Mafeking tells about the working of the Cape Immigration Restriction Act. According to our correspondent, Indians who have returned to India, leaving their businesses ten years old and having  landed property at the Cape, find it difficult to return if they are not in possession of certificates of domicile taken out by them prior to their departure, and that, similarly, Indians having been resident for a number of years find it difficult to obtain such certificates, on leaving. He adds that when they are issued, they are tenable only for one year, so that if an Indian returns to his adopted home in the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope a day later than the period given in thecertificate, he would be a prohibited immigrant. A system such as this can only be described as a deliberate and cruel attempt to drive Indians out of the Cape without having to pay them any compensation whatsoever. The remedy is largely in the hands of the Cape Indians, and we warn the various associations there that they will be responsible to the community should the threatened disaster befall British Indians, and should they, five years hence, find that there are very few Indians to be found at the Cape. We would advise our correspondent to contin- ually address the Indian associations at Cape Town until they are roused to action from their apparent lethargy.

408,,THE ASIATIC REGISTRATION ACTlibtech_540_footnote,"
    
 A TERRIBLE CONTRAST
 Whilst Indians are showing their firm determination not to  submit to the Asiatic Registration Act, it is as well to understand their objection to it. I, therefore, propose to show in parallel columns the state that they are in now and that in which they would be under the new law.
 NOW	UNDER THE NEW LAW
   Malays 		are subject to Law 		3 of 1885.            Every 		Asiatic in 		posse- ssion of 		a permit 		bona fide obtained 		is a full-fledged 		and lawful 		resident of the Transvaal.         An 		Asiatic child born 		since the 31st day of 		May, 1902 		in the 		Orange River Colony, 		is entitled 		to enter 		and remain 		in the Transvaal.  Present 		permits held by 		Asiatics entitle them 		to enter 		and reside 		in the Transvaal and 		Orange River 		Colony. Whether 		these are 		of any 		use for going into 		the Orange River 		Colony is 		not the question.   They 			are exempted 			from the 			new law. Many 			Indians have Malay 			wives and 			relatives.  The 			position of 			such Indians 			when they 			meet their Malay relatives can 			be better 			imagined than described.  He 			becomes dispossessed 			of this 			title and the 			burden of 			showing that the permit 			lawfully held 			by him 			was not fraudulently 			obtained is 			thrown on 			him to 			 entitle him to 			receive the new 			registration certificate. Such 			child is debarred.              This 			right, so far as 			the permit 			can give it, is taken away.   
   Asiatics holding permits	5. 			These are 			not allowed.      
 to reside in the Orange River Colony are in a position to enter the Transvaal on the strength thereof.
   Present 		permits cannot 		be changed 		without the consent 		of the holders.  Asiatic 		children are not 		required to 		take out permits.  
 
 
 
 
  They 	are subject to 	altera- tion 	at the will 	of the Government. 
 
  The 	guardian of 	such child 	is bound, 	under heavy 	penalty, to have particulars 	of identification 	of: such child, 	no matter how 	young, endorsed on 	his registration. 	When the  child reaches 	the age of 	8 years, the guardian 	is bound 	to again 	app- roach 	the Registrar and 	take out registration 	for such 	child, furnishing 	further particulars as 	to identification, etc. 
   
  Minors 		who are at 		present in 		the Transvaal are entitled to remain 		without a permit, and 		are not 		liable  to leave the 		country on 		attaining majority. No 		Asiatic is 		bound to 		furnish	particulars	of 		identification    All 		such boys on 		reaching the 		age of 16 		are liable to be 		deported unless 		they obtain from 		the Registrar  		registration certificates, the granting of which is at his discretion.  Even 		a Kafir policeman 		may demand production 		of certificate 		and particulars 		of identi 		fication, which may 		be fixed 		by regulation 		from time to 		tirne. Such 		policeman may, 		notwithstanding, take the Asiatic to  the  nearest police 		station, where the same 		inquiry may 		be repeated,  and,  if 		the Officer at 		the station is not satisfied, 		he may 		detain the 		Asiatic in the cell overnight.  
  An	Asiatic	can	10. 		No Asiatic may receive  
 demand a trade licence as a right against payment without production of permit.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Any 	Asiatic is 	free to 	employ any 	other Asiatic. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The 	Registrar, at 	pre- sent, 	has fairly 	strong authority. 
 
 
 Asiatics 	who come 	in possession of 	certificates belonging 	to others 	commit no crime. 
 such licence unless he produces his registration certificate and furnishes means of identification, as may be prescribed  by regulation. If, there- fore, there are partners in any Asiatic firm, the Licensing Officer may insist upon the presence of all the parties and submit them to a humiliating examination before giving them their licence.
  Any 	Asiatic who 	brings into 	the Colony an 	Asiatic under the 	age of 16 	(even his son!) without 	a permit 	for him, 	or who 	employs such 	child, is liable 	to be 	heavily fined or 	sent to 	gaol, and 	to have 	his own right 	to reside 	in the 	Transvaal cancelled.  The 	Registrar practically 	becomes the master of 	Asiatics with almost 	unlimited power 	over their personal liberty.  Asiatics 	having such 	certificates (evidently 	a father 	having his 	son’s register) 	 are bound 	to deliver same by 	post under 	pain of 	being fined £50 	or, in 	default, sent to gaol. 
  ADDITIONAL 	POINTS 	TO BE NOTED  	l. The new law does not apply to Kaffirs, to Cape Boys, and 	Christian subjects of the Turkish Empire, whereas it applies to the 	Mahomedan subjects of that Empire, and it thus insults Indians and 	their religion in a cold-blooded manner. It reduces them to a state 	of serfdom although belonging to civilized countries. It reduces 	them to a position lower than that of the Kaffirs, Cape Boys and 	Malays.   It 		puts a 		premium on 		fraud. It 		might have occurred 		to the framers of the 		law that there is 		nothing to 		prevent an Asiatic  
 impersonating a Malay or Cape Boy.
  It 	opens up 	a fertile 	field for 	permit agents to 	prey upon 	harmless Asiatics. It 	must be 	well known to 	the Permit 	authorities that 	Asiatics are not, as a 	rule, capable of filling 	in complicated 	applicationforms, being 	ignorant of the 	ways of Government 	departments and 	easily terrorized. 	At the very least, 	therefore, assuming 	that Indians 	and Chinese 	combined would 	make 12,000 	applicants, they 	would be robbed 	of £36,000, 	counting the fee at 	£3 per 	head on an average. 
 Who, then, can wonder if Asiatics prefer gaol to submission to such an extraordinary law and to such extortion? Verily, the whole of the Transvaal would to them become, during their residence therein, a wretched gaol. It does, indeed, need the intoxication of power to blind one to the wretched state of misery to which the new law reduces Asiatics.

NEW OBNOXIOUS LAW","
 Futile is strength devoid of courage, Doomed is a house divided;
Naught is wealth without knowledge,
And evil the use of learning by the wicked.
 A summary of this Act was published in our issue of September 1[1906]. Even so, we give here a more detailed translation, so that people may form a correct judgment on the real nature of the Act. Between the summary of the Act published by us in September and the Act that has now been passed, there is some difference that is worth noting. The Act as it stands now is even more anti-Indian than the original version.
  Law 	No. 3 of 	1885 will remain 	in force 	with modifications 	that follow.  The 	term “Asiatic” will 	mean Indians, coolies, and 	Muslim subjects 	of Turkey. 	It will not 	include Malays and 	the Chinese 	who had come 	in as indentured 	labourers. (There are 	other definitions, of 	Registrar, etc., which 	are not given 	here.) Every 	Asiatic lawfully residing 	in the Transvaal must 
 register himself. There will be no fee for such registration.
 Asiatics of the following description will be deemed lawful residents of the Transvaal:
  Any 	Asiatic who holds 	a permit 	under the 	Permit  Act, unless such 	permit was 	fraudulently obtained. 	(Temporary permits 	are not covered 	by this.)  Any 	Asiatic resident 	and actually 	in the 	Transvaal on 	the 31st 	of May, 1902.  Any 	Asiatic born 	in the 	Transvaal after 	the 31st of 	May, 1902. 
  Every 	Asiatic resident in the 	Transvaal at 	the date of 	the taking 	effect of this 	Act shall apply for 	registration to 	such officer, 	at such place 	and before 	such date 	as may be 	prescribed by 	the Colonial 	Secretary. Every Asiatic 	who enters the 	Transvaal after 	the date of 	the taking 	effect of this 	Act, who has not 	previously been 	registered thereunder, 	shall apply for 	registration within 	eight days of his entry. 
  It 	is not necessary 	to make 	an application 	under this clause 	for a 	child under the 	age of eight years.  For 	the registration of 	a child 	above eight years and under 	sixteen years, the 	application shall be 	made by 	his guardian 	and, if 	not so 	made, shall be 	made by 	such child within one 	month after attaining 	the age of 	sixteen years. 
  The 	Registrar shall 	consider the 	applications of 	 Asiatics who 	are lawful residents, 	‘and register every such applicant 	whose application may 	be approved 	by him. 
 If the Registrar rejects the application of any Asiatic, he will give to the person concerned at least fourteen days’ notice  to  appear before a magistrate. If he fails to appear at the time specified, or having appeared fails to satisfy the magistrate as to his right to remain in the Transvaal, the magistrate shall order such Asiatic to leave the Transvaal if he is above sixteen years of age. On the other hand, if the magistrate is satisfied that the Asiatic concerned is lawfully resident in the Transvaal, he shall order the Registrar to issue him the certificate of registration.
  Any 	Asiatic who 	is the 	guardian of 	a child 	under eight 	shall, upon making application for registration on his own 
 behalf, supply to the Registrar such particulars and furnish such means of identification in respect of the child as may be prescribed by regulation. If the applicant is himself registered, such particulars shall be noted on the register. Within one year of the child attaining the age of eight, the guardian concerned shall make application for registration on behalf of the child at the office of the Resident Magistrate of the district in which he resides.
 An Asiatic who is the guardian of a child born in the Transvaal shall apply for registration on behalf of the child within one year of the child reaching the age of eight.
  If 	the guardian 	does not apply 	as required 	above, he shall 	if required 	by the 	Registrar or 	the Resident 	Magistrate make such 	application at any later date.  If 	the guardian 	does not 	apply, or 	if the application 	made by 	the guardian 	is rejected, 	the application 	for registration 	shall be 	made by 	the child 	within one month 	after reaching the 	age of sixteen. 	The Resident 	Magistrate at whose 	office such 	applica-tion is 	made shall 	cause the application 	along with 	the relevant documents 	to be forwarded 	to  the Registrar 	who shall, 	if satis-fied 	that the 	same is 	in order, issue 	a certificate 
  of 	registration.When the 	guardian has 	not, as required above, 	furnished the 	particulars of 	a child 	under the age of 	eight years and 	has not made application 	for registration 	on behalf 	of the 	child after he 	had attained 	the age of 	eight years, 	the application 	shall be made 	by the 	child within one 	month after he attains 	the age of 	sixteen, and 	the Registrar may 	issue a 	certificate of 	registration in 	his discretion.  Any 	person who shall fail to 	make application 	for registration 	as required 	by this 	Act shall be liable 	to a 	fine not exceeding 	£100 and, 	in default of payment, 	to imprisonment 	with or 	without hard 	labour for 	a period 	not exceeding 	three months. 
 Any person who brings into the Transvaal an Asiatic under the age of sixteen years not lawfully resident in the Transvaal, and any person who shall employ such child, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to the penalties mentioned above and to cancellation of his certificate of registration, in addition to which he will be ordered to leave the Transvaal. If he does not leave the Transvaal, he will be liable
 to a fine or to imprisonment, as provided in the law.
 Any Asiatic over the age of sixteen years who is found in the Transvaal without a registration certificate after such date as may be notified by the Colonial Secretary will be ordered to leave the Transvaal, and if he does not leave the Transvaal, shall be liable to a fine or to imprisonment.
 If an Asiatic who has failed to make application for registration shall satisfy the magistrate that such failure was due to some good and sufficient cause, the magistrate may give him time to make such application. If the person fails to obtain registration within the appointed time, he shall again be ordered to leave the Transvaal, and if he fails to do so, shall be liable to the usual penalties.
  Any 	member of 	the police 	force or 	any other person 	authorized thereto 	by the 	Colonial Secretary may 	require an 	Asiatic of 	the age of 	sixteen or 	over to produce 	his certificate 	of registration 	and supply 	such particulars and 	furnish such 	means of identification 	as may 	be prescribed 	by regulation. 
 With regard to an Asiatic under the age of sixteen years, the guardian of such child shall produce the certificate of registration and supply the particulars and furnish the means of identification required by this Act.
  Any 	person holding 	a new 	certificate of 	registration issued 	to him 	under this Act 	shall be 	entitled to 	enter and 	to reside 	in the Transvaal.  Any 	person into 	whose hands shall come 	any certificate of 	registration or 	temporary permit 	of which 	he is not the 	lawful holder shall 	transmit the 	document immediately to 	the Registrar. 	If he fails 	to do so, he shall 	be liable 	to afine 	not exceeding 	£50 or 	to imprisonment with or 	without hard 	labour for 	a period 	not exceeding 	one month.  Any 	person who 	loses his 	certificate of 	registration shall 	apply to 	the Registrar 	to have 	it renewed. 	The application 	shall contain such 	particulars as 	may be 	required under the 	rules, and 	it must have a 	5s stamp affixed to 	it.  After 	a date 	to be notified 	in the 	Gazette, no 	Asiatic shall 	obtain   a 	  trading   licence 	  under   the 	  Revenue  Licences 
 Ordinance or under any bye-law in force in a municipal area unless he produces his certificate of registration and supplies such particulars and furnishes such means of identification as may be prescribed by regulation.
  Whenever 	the age of any Asiatic 	is in question, 	such Asiatic shall, 	unless and until 	the contrary 	be proved, 	be taken 	to be 	of the age which 	the Registrar 	shall certify 	to be in his 	opinion the 	apparent age 	of such Asiatic.  Any 	affidavit that may 	have to 	be made under this Act 	shall be 	exempt from 	stamp duty.  Any 	person who 	commits any 	fraudulent act 	in connection 	with an 	application for 	registration or 	for the purpose 	of obtaining 	a certificate of 	registration or 	makes a 	false statement, or 	incites or 	aids any 	person in such 	act or statement, 	or forges 	any certificate 	of registration, 	or uses 	as his 	certificate any 	certificate of 	registration of 	which he 	is not 	the lawful holder or 	any forged 	certificate, or causes 	such certificate to 	be used by 	others, shall be 	liable to 	a fine not 	exceeding £500 	or to imprisonment 	with or 	without hard 	labour for a 	term not 	exceeding two years.  The 	Colonial Secretary may 	in his 	absolute discretion 	issue to 	any Asiatic 	a permit for 	a limited time only. 	The provisions 	of Section 	9 shall 	apply to such 	permits, and 	temporary permits 	issued before 	the date of 	the taking  effect 	of this 	Act shall 	also be governed 	by this 	Act. Any person 	who holds 	a temporary 	permit may be 	exempted from 	the restrictions 	on the 	use of liquor. 	The Colonial 	Secretary may 	also grant such 	exemption to an Asiatic 	who is 	not subject to 	the provisions of 	this Act.  The 	Governor may from 	time to time make 	or repeal regulations for 	any of the 	following purposes: 
  Prescribing 	the form of 	the register 	to be kept 	under this 	Act;  Prescribing 	the manner 	and form 	in which 	application shall be 	made for registration, 	the particulars 	to be supplied 	and the 	means of 	identification to 	be furnished;  Prescribing 	the form 	of certificates 	of registration;  Prescribing 	the particulars 	and the means of 	identification marks 	to be furnished 	by the 	guardian of 	a child 	under the age of 	eight years, 	by any 	Asiatic who 	may be required 	to produce his 	certificate of 	registration under 	Section 9, 	by any 	Asiatic applying 	for the renewal 	of any 	certificate of 	registration which has 	been lost or destroyed 	and by 	any Asiatic 	applying for a 	trading licence.  Prescribing 	the form of 	permit to 	be. issued 	under Section 	17 of the Act. 
  Any 	Asiatic or 	guardian of 	an Asiatic failing to 	comply with 	any requirement of 	this Act shall, except 	where otherwise 	specified, be liable 	to a 	fine not exceeding 	£100 or 	to imprisonment 	with or 	without hard 	labour  for 	 a period 	not exceeding 	three months.  The 	Labour Importation 	Ordinance relating to 	the Chinese 	shall not apply to Asiatics.  If 	an Asiatic has 	acquired any 	land in 	his name 	before the taking 	effect of the 	Law [3] of 1885, 	his heir 	and successor 	will be entitled to that land.  This 	Act shall 	not come 	into force till 	such time 	as the Emperor is 	pleased to 	give his assent and his 	assent is notified in 	the Gazette. 
 IMPLICATIONS OF ACT
 Fortunately for Indians, no Indian is found ready to accept this obnoxious law. Nevertheless, we show below how the condition to which Indians will now be reduced will be much worse than what they have suffered so far, so that those Indians who are firm may become stronger in their determination, and those who are wavering in their minds may give up their doubts, may of their own accord break away from the clutches of the Act, remain free and thus prove themselves to be brave men.
  The 	new law does 	not apply to 	Malays, but applies 	to Indians. It 	does not 	apply to 	Kaffirs and 	Cape Boys. It 	does not apply 	to Turkish 	Christians, but 	does to 
 [Turkish] Muslims.
  At 	present, every 	Indian in 	possession of 	a permit 	bearing his 	thumb-impression is 	a lawful 	resident. Under 	the new 	Act, he becomes 	dispossessed of 	this title, and, when 	applying for 	a new 	permit, such Indian will 	have to show how 	his earlier valid permit was obtained.  Present 	permits cannot be 	changed without the 	consent of 	the holders. 	The permits 	to be issued 	under the new Act are 	subject to 	alteration at 	the will of 	the Government.  The 	present permits held by 	Indians entitle them to 	enter and 	reside in 	the Orange 	River Colony. 	Whether these are 	of any use or not is not 	the question. Under this 	newAct,   the 	name of 	the Orange 	River Colony is omitted 	from the 	permits.  At 	present, Indians holding 	permits to reside 	in the 	Orange River 	Colony are in 	a position to 	enter the 	Transvaal on 	the strength 	thereof. Under the 	new Act, they will not 	be able to 	do so.  At 	present, no Indian 	is bound 	to  give  his 	thumb-impression or his 	signature to 	obtain a permit. Under 	the new Act, 	by making 	or modifying 	rules from 	time to 	time at 	its pleasure, 	the Government 	can prescribe 	the giving 	of signature 	or thumb 	impression, or 	any other 	thing to 	be done, as compulsory.  At 	present, only the 	Permit Secretary is 	authorized to 	inspect a 	permit. Under the 	new Act, every Kaffir 	police constable 	can do so.  Under 	the new Act, 	a Kaffir 	police constable can 	ask [an Asiatic] 	for particulars 	of name 	and identity, 	and, if 	not satisfied, can 	take him to the 	police station. 	The Station 	Officer, if 	not satisfied 	with the particulars, 	may detain 	the Asiatic 	in a 	cell and 	produce him 	before a 	magistrate the 	next day. All 	this cannot be done under the 	present Act.  At 	present, no 	permit is 	required for 	a child 	one day old, 	and no 	one dare ask for 	particulars of 	name and identity 	in respect of such child. Under the new Act, the guardian of 
 such child is bound to have particulars of identification of such child, no matter how young, endorsed on his registr- ation.
  At 	present, an 	Asiatic child is 	free after reaching the 	age of eight. 	Under the new Act, even 	after having the 	required particulars 	endorsed as above, 	the guardian 	is bound 	again to 	approach the 	Registrar and 	take out registration 	for such 	child, furnishing 	further particulars as 	to identification, etc. 	In case he fails to do so, he will be liable to punishment.  Asiatic 	children who 	are at present 	in the Transvaal are 	entitled to 	remain without a 	permit, and 	are not liable to 	leave the 	country on 	attaining majority. 	Under the new Act, 	all such 	boys are liable 	to be deported 	unless they obtain 	from the Registrar 	registration certificates, the 	granting of 	which is at his discretion.  At 	present, an 	Asiatic is 	free to bring 	with him 	a child 	under the 	age of sixteen 	without a permit 	for him. 	Under the 	new Act, any 	Asiatic doing so 	is liable to 	imprisonment with 	hard labour, 	and to 	have his own  registration 	cancelled.  At 	present, any 	Asiatic can 	obtain a 	trading licence without 	production of a 	permit. Under the 	new Act, he will 	have to produce 	his new register 	and furnish 	particulars of 	name, etc.,and 	means of identification. 	Which means that if 	there are partners 	in an Indian 	firm, the Licensing 	Officer may 	insist upon the 	presence of 	all the parties. 	In case 	they do not 	remain present, he 	can refuse to 	issue the licence.  At 	present, the authority 	of the 	Registrar is relatively limited. 	Under the 	new Act, if accepted 	by Indians, 	the Registrar will practically become their master.  Under 	the new Act, 	applying for 	registration is 	compulsory for 	every Indian. Indians 	who are in 	a position 	to apply 	for themselves are 	very rare. Permit agents 	have earned 	much but 	if the 	Indians submit to 	the new Act, those 	agents will 	have a 	fertile field opened up 	to them, money flowing 	into their 	hands like 	a swarm of serpents 	rushing out 	of a 	mound. At 	the very least, 	therefore, assuming that there will 	be 10,000 	Indian applicants, 	they will 	be robbed of 	£ 30,000, counting the fee at £3 per head on an average.  Anyone 	submitting to 	such an 	oppressive  law  and 	obtaining registers, or 	causing others to 	obtain them, will be 	shedding the blood of Indians by robbing them as above. 
 Is there any Indian who is not roused to fury by such a law? We should very much like to know the Indian whose blood does not boil. And it is incredible to us that any Indian may want to submit to such legislation. This new Act is the extreme limit of slavery. And it is our earnest hope that no Indian will accept it, whatever the benefit he may get thereby, but that everyone will resist it at all cost. What Mr. Kallenbachlibtech_541_footnotewrites is quite true: that is, if we submit to such a law, we deserve itlibtech_542_footnoteEveryone will believe so. It is to be borne in mind that this Act not only insults Indians but casts a slur on the religion of both Hindus and Muslims. For, Hindus and Muslims who come from India are, as a matter of course, covered by it. But even the Muslims of Turkey (which is considered a part of Europe) are brought within the mischief of the Act, as if the Transvaal Government will be in danger if Muslims not belonging to India are excluded. Christians from that country are not touched.

410,,COMMITTEE’S MISTAKE,"
    
 
 The South Africa British Indian Committee’s communication to General Botha is very good and covers every point. This Committee has done so much work and done it so well that we cannot thank Sir Muncherjeelibtech_543_footnote, Mr. Ritchlibtech_544_footnoteand other members well enough. Wetherefore feel some hesitation in pointing out one mistake the Committee has made in the communication. However, it is our duty to do so. The mistake does not diminish the value of the Committee. It only proves how every human being is liable to err. The mistake consists in the
 
 suggestion that the Indian community may, at its option, append photographs in place of finger-prints. Though it has been left to the Indians whether or not to append the photograph, we hold that even the suggestion should not have been made by the Committee. Moreover, the Committee’s communication makes it appear as though the giving of finger-prints were the only or the greatest objection to the new law. In fact, finger-prints form but one of the objections. The crucial point is the compulsory registration under the law, which casts a slur on the community and brands it as unworthy.
 However, the mistake is not likely to do any harm. No such mistake was made during the struggle against the Bill. After the Bill has become law, the Committee’s suggestion is not likely to have any adverse effect. For now the matter rests in the hands of the Indian community. If the Indian community really disapproves of the law, it will not submit to it, no matter what calamities befall it; it will accept imprisonment for not submitting to it; and will feel happy doing so because its honour will have been preserved.
 As Mr. Ritch says, some members may even leave the Com- mittee, as Mr. Reeslibtech_545_footnotedid, on seeing the Indian community determined to disobey the law. It is likely that such members will advise us to submit to disgrace. Even so, we need not be afraid, for the Indian community holds it to be a virtue not to submit to the new law, and in doing a good deed we need not be afraid of anyone. Knowing that God always protects the righteous, the Transvaal Indians should keep to the straight path they have chosen for themselves.

411,,INDIANS OF CAPE TOWN,"
    
 
 It appears to us that the condition of Indians in Cape Town is likely to be very bad in days to come. We publish elsewhere in this issue a letter received from Mafeking and draw the attention of every Indian leader in Cape Town to it. The worst clause in the Cape Town Act is to the effect that an Indian who leaves Cape Town without a pass cannot return to it. Such a pass will be valid only for one year.
 
 There are hundreds of Indians who know nothing about taking out a pass. Even if a pass is taken out, it will not be possible for everyone to return with that pass within one year. As a result of this Act, it is likely that within five years Indians will have left Cape Town, bag and baggage. We earnestly hope that leading Indians in Cape Town will deeply ponder over this question and take suitable steps.

412,,LATE MR. KARL BLIND,"
    
 News has been received by cable that Mr. Karl Blindlibtech_546_footnotelibtech_547_footnoteis dead. This gentleman was a famous German. He was born in 1826. He suffered imprisonment five times, between 1847 and 1849, in the cause of freedom and for the rights of others. In this way he had to suffer imprisonment for opposing his Government. Once he was even sentenced to death for a public cause, but was saved. Later, he again suffered imprisonment for eight years, but in the end people got him released through pressure. This great man was a friend of Mazzini and Garibaldilibtech_548_footnotelibtech_549_footnote. He helped Japan against Russia. He was  a  very  learned man. He has written many historical works. He was a lover of India. Such scholars who, making other people’s sufferings their own, have served sentences of imprisonment and even faced the gallows provide a very useful example to us today.

413,,WHAT CAN HINDU WIDOWS DO?,"
    
 
 Everyone can see that in India a great deal of wealth is being wasted. This wealth includes many things. None takes care of the minerals. Our cotton is exported to foreign countries, and cloth is imported from there. Even a pin has to be imported from abroad.
 
 
 What happens to our material wealth seems to be happening to our human wealth also. Many bavas and fakirs maintain themselves by begging, but serve neither themselves nor the country. For  going about begging in this manner, they will not be regarded as having attained true renunciation. In the same way, thousands of widows, mostly among Hindus, spend their whole life to no purpose. And to that extent the wealth of India is being wasted. To prevent this waste, the benevolent Prof. Karvelibtech_550_footnotelibtech_551_footnoteof Poona has dedicated his   life  to  the country. He has been working in the Fergusson College only on a living wage. Not only that, but he has also been running for several years an institution in Poona for the education of widows. There, women are given training in midwifery and nursing. The work of the institution has been expanding. Because he is rendering honorary service himself, he is able to get similar assistance from others too. Mrs. Kashibai Deodhar, Mrs. Namjoshi, Mrs. Athavale and Mrs. Deshpande—all these ladies who have had very good English educa- tion have been giving honorary service to the institution. Moreover, he goes about from place to place collecting funds. There are so many things which can be done through sheer self-help and without Government aid. From every point of view, education is the most important thing for us.

414,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
    
 NEW LAW
 This law has not yet been published in the Gazette. Meanwhile, cables received from England indicate that the Imperial Government is still considering the matter. When Lord Ampthilllibtech_552_footnotelibtech_553_footnoteraised adiscussion in  the  House  of  Lords,  Lord  Lansdownelibtech_554_footnotelibtech_555_footnotesaid  that  wounding  the susceptibilities of the whole Indian community would be more injurious and imprudent than the surreptitious entry of a few Indians
 
 into the country. In his reply, Lord Elginlibtech_556_footnotesaid that he [also] did not like to put his signature to the Act. The lesson of this is that Indians should not submit to the law. It will be a great humiliation to the Indian community if it submits to a law which has raised such a heated controversy and has been so much condemned.
 REPERCUSSIONS OF TRANSVAAL LAW
 It is not as if the effects of this law will be felt only here. Already, its repercussions have reached even German East Africa. The Germans there wish to take full advantage of the Indian trader, without however allowing him any benefit in return. Some Germans expressed the fear that the British Government might intervene if the Indian traders were harassed. A member of the German Parliament replied by asking how the British Government, which did not intervene in the case of the Transvaal, could do so in respect of the Germans. This too points to the self-same lesson. As soon as the Indian community submits to the new law, it may be taken for granted that its foothold in all territories outside India will be lost. Thereafter, only those Indians will be able to reside in places outside India who will live on their labour? without any status.
 ADVICE OF PROMINENT WHITE
 I had a meeting with a prominent member of the Transvaal Parliament. On being asked about the gaol resolution, he immediately replied that if we went to prison, no further steps would be necessary. He had not expected that Indians would show so much courage and display such spirit for the sake of the community  and  for  their honour. If we remained united and adhered to the gaol resolution, he promised to give us as much help as he could. Moreover, he added, the entire Liberal Party in England would come to our rescue and the new law would be repealed. He quoted Burke, the great English writer, who used to say that thousands of men could not be sent to the gallows, nor could they be kept confined behind prison-bars.
 WHAT WHITE TRADER SAYS
 A white merchant took upon himself to give prudent advice and said that the Indian community should submit to the law. He was asked if he thought that others were happy because he himself lived in
 
 
 comfort and happiness as a result of the struggle that his ancestors had put up. He could not answer the question. In the end I asked him, in the presence of a big customer, “Suppose your customer sacrifices hisall and goes to gaol for the sake of his community. Will he not, when he comes out, rise in your estimation? Will you not help him more liberally?” To this he replied, “Yes. That’s right. But do your people have so much courage?” Ultimately, the thing comes to this: in the market the Indian cowrie is treated as a bad coin at present, and so the value of the Indian is the value of a bad coin.
 LETTER TO “THE STAR”
 As General Botha has returned and the Committee in England is still continuing its struggle against the law, Mr. Gandhi has addressed the following letter to The Star:libtech_557_footnote
 The arrival of General Botha and the fact that the Asiatic Registration Act is still the subject matter of correspondence between the Imperial Government and the local Government, encourage me to appeal once more to your good sense and, through you, to that of the Colonists. Now that the anti-Asiatic party has obtained what it wanted, is it impossible to arrive at a reasonable compromise and to do away with a law under which Indians will be treated as criminals? The Act is not yet gazetted, and it need not be. I, therefore, suggest that a form for new permits may be mutually agreed upon, and, in accordance with it, Indians and other Asiatics may be registered afresh in exchange for proper documents they may posses. If, then, all Asiatics thus voluntarily surrender their documents, there can be no occasion for submitting them to any degradation. If, however, there are Asiatics in the Colony who do not surrender their documents, the Act can be immediately gazetted, and be made applicable, by a short Bill, to them. Thus, those who are bona fide holders of permits and are honest will be automatically separated from those who are guilty.
 I do not know whether you can see any flaw in this proposal, unless you think that the object of the legislation is not that illicit traffic in permits may be stopped, but that it is to, openly and boldly, put an unwarranted affront upon British Indians and other Asiatics. Let me remind you, before any such declaration is made, of Lord Ampthill’s remarks:
 This is not a matter which only touches our honour. We are pledged to our fellow-citizens in India—pledged by the solemn declaration of the Sovereign, by the pronouncements of our statesmen, and by all that is implied in the
 
 whole method of our administration of that great dominion—to treat the people of India as fellow-citizens in every sense of the word. We invite them to be proud of their citizenship of the Empire. We tell them, again and again, that there is nothing to prevent their rising to the same positions as are held by Englishmen in India, and we imply, in all that we do for them and say to them, that wherever they are under the British flag in any part of the world, they will be treated as British citizens.
 Lord Lansdowne feels so keenly humiliated by this Act, that he questions whether to wound the susceptibilities of the whole Indian nation is not a more important matter than the conditions in the Transvaal. But the proposal I have ventured to sketch above is just as effective against surreptitious entry as may be by the Asiatic Act.
 If the Government does not accept the suggestion made in this letter, it would obviously mean that the new law had no other aim than that of humiliating the Indian community. Then the fable of the wolf and the lamb would apply. The wolf is bent on killing the lamb anyhow.
 KALLENBACH’S HELP
 Mr. Kallenbach is a well-known architect of Johannesburg. He has written the following letter to The Star in order to sustain the spirit of the Indian community and encourage it in its gaol-going resolve. This letter is also published along with Mr. Gandhi’s:libtech_558_footnote
 Although, for some reasons, I am not taking part in  political matters, I have been following with interest the various stages of action among the Transvaal Indians in their struggle to defend their legitimate rights by that ‘gaol resolution’.
 I have read the various Press comments on the latter question, and also Mr. Gandhi’s letter to The Star, in all of which the gaol resolution was discussed. I for one am of the opinion that the Asiatic Registration Ordinance imposes certain conditions which are degrading to any man of self-respect, and if this was not keenly felt by Asiatics, it would be a clear proof that they fully deserve the Registration Act. I think it most unfair to call those men, who are working in order to show to their countrymen the deep humiliation which the new legislation tries to impose upon them, “aggressive agitators”. I believe it to be the duty of those Indians, who are able to grasp the conditions
 
 of the new legislation, to impart this knowledge to every one of their countrymen and to do their utmost to so raise and strengthen their self-respect that by united action those humiliating conditions are changed. I feel sure that the fear of the Indian storekeepers’ competition has not deadened every “white man’s” sense of justice, and that many of them—and I hope that their number is not small—cannot do otherwise than show their admiration and full sympathy for men who, rather than submit to humiliating legislative conditions, go to gaol, setting aside, in addition to the hardships of prison life which they are prepared to face, monetary losses too.
 I have never overlooked the very keen competition existing between the various races, but I have found that it has been exaggerated on the European side. The suggestions and propositions made by the British Indian Association of Johannesburg appeared to me very reasonable and fair, and I feel certain that fuller knowledge of the Indian question in the Transvaal, by those men responsible for and dealing with the same, would have prevented the present acute state of affairs
 In conclusion, I wish to say that I shall consider it a privilege to visit my Indian friends in the gaol and to do my utmost to redress the hardships of prison life which they are prepared to undergo....
 Mr. Kallenbach deserves compliments for having written such a noble letter. It would not be surprising if more whites like him came forward. If already men like Mr. Kallenbach have come forward to express their sympathy even though we have nothing to show by way of action, many more will do so when we actually do something.
 MEETING OF ASSOCIATION
 At 4.30 p.m. on Saturday, a meeting of the Association took place to consider the question of a deputation  to  General  Botha. Those present included the acting Chairman, Mr. Essop Mia, Messrs Abdool Ganilibtech_559_footnotelibtech_560_footnote, Coovadia, Naidoo, Omarji Sale, Alibhai Akuji, Pillay, Mahomed, Emam Abdool Cadir and other gentlemen. Mr. Hajee Habiblibtech_561_footnotelibtech_562_footnotehad come from Pretoria specially to attend this meeting. After certain points had been decided, it was resolved to send a deputation to General Botha, Mr. Hajee Habib moving and Mr. Coovadia seconding the resolution. It was also decided to submit a petition requesting the Government to accept the proposal contained in Mr.
 
 Gandhi’s letter to The Star referred to above, and that General Botha should be informed that, if that proposal was turned down by the Government and the desired changes were not made in the law, the Indian community would never accept the law and would adhere to the September Resolution. It was resolved that the deputation should consist of Messrs Essop Mia, Abdool Gani, Hajee Habib, Moonlight, and Gandhi. Accordingly, Mr. Essop Mia has asked General Botha for an   appointment.libtech_563_footnoteBy   the   time   this   letter   is  published   in   Indian Opinion, the deputation may have already waited upon  General Botha.
 WHAT CAN GOVERNMENT DO BUT IMPRISON US?
 It has been suggested that the Government may not prosecute any Indian for not taking out the new registers, but quietly wait till the end of the year when Indians will have to close down their businesses, since their trading licences will not be renewed. It is improbable that this will happen. For, in that case, the hundreds of Indians who hold no trading licences will never come within the sweep of the law. The employees of a trader will escape penalty. Adopting that course will render the law as good as non-existent. But supposing that the Government’s intention is only to harass merchants, I have already given the reply that once we have discarded the fear of imprisonment, there is nothing for us to be afraid of. The Government itself will stand to lose if it does not grant licences. For, the merchant can carry on his trade without a licence. The risk in doing so will be just the same as the risk in not taking out the new register. If the new registeris not taken out, at the most one has to go to gaol. In the same way, for trading without a licence one may have to go to gaol. The only difference will be that only one man will be punished for trading without a licence, with the result that the shop can remain open and the employees can work in it. On the other hand, for not holding the new register everyone can be arrested.
 CAN GOODS OF MERCHANT TRADING WITHOUT LICENCE BE AUCTIONED?
 This question also has been raised. According to the Natal law the goods can be auctioned. But in the Transvaal, in case of non-
 
 payment of fine the defaulter has to go to gaol. Fine is not to be paid by anyone. If therefore the Government should want to exercise pressure on us through the trade licence, all shopkeepers and hawkers will start trading without a licence.
 CAN SHOPS BE CLOSED DOWN?
 It has been asked whether the Government can close down the shop of anyone trading without a licence. Nowhere in South Africa is there a law providing for the forcible closure of a shop. There is therefore no such danger.
 WHAT CHANGES CAN BE MADE THROUGH REGULATIONS?
 There has been an inquiry as to whether it will be possible for General Botha to give us relief in the regulations, and whether it will still be necessary for us to resist the law if we get all the relief asked for. In the first place, it is. essential to know what can be secured through regulations. These can only determine whether a thumb- impression or digit-impressions will be required or whether signatures will be enough. But such matters as registration of children,harassment by the police, showing of identification marks to the police, etc., which are the oppressive sections in this Act, cannot be changed by regulations. In brief, the slur that the law casts on us cannot be wiped out by regulations framed under it. Without amending the law therefore General Botha cannot give us the redress we seek. It is absolutely futile to hope that the law will be amended. The utmost that can be done is not to have the law gazetted for the present. By this the prestige of both parties will be maintained. If the law is so amended as to make it acceptable to us, the Government will lose face.
 FREE INDIANS WORSE THAN DOGS
 A huge agricultural exhibition is being held here just now. The Exhibition Committee has framed a regulation to the effect that free Asiatics or Natives who are not employees of whites cannot visit the exhibition. However, dogs are free to enter, and, what is more, good pedigree dogs are awarded prizes! In the opinion of this white Committee, a free Indian is worse than these dogs.
 PERMIT OFFICE
 A case appears to have just occurred which shows that we did very well in having boycotted the Permit Office. An Indian had
 received a notice saying that a permit would be issued to him. He had only to go to the Office and receive it He was therefore advised that he might accept the permit if no mention of the new law was made. Accordingly, he went to the Permit Office. However, Mr. Chamney told him that the permit would be issued to him only if he gave an assurance that he would submit to the new law. The brave Indian refused to comply and left the Office without the permit. Every Indian should understand that the Permit Office is a trap for Indians.
 WHAT INDIAN TRADERS CAN DO
 Many Indian traders say that the Dutchmen are ready to send a petition to the Government stating that they are not against us. If this is the case, it is necessary for every Indian trader to obtain signatures of Dutchmen on such a petition. It is not necessary to make much fuss in the matter. If the traders wish to take it up, petition forms will be sent to them. Those in a position to obtain signatures should write to the Association.
 REGULATIONS FOR HAWKERS
 The Government has returned [to the Town Council] the regula- tions for hawkers, saying that the licence fee of £5 may be reduced to
 £3. The Council Committee has sent a reply stating that the rate of £5 should be retained, as a reduction would result in financial loss.
 PERMIT CASE
 Permit cases have been going on for some time. Two washermen were accused of using false permits and of staying without permits. In their defence, they stated that an Indian had taken them to Johannes- burg, telling them that the Permit Officer visited the town and issued permit. The said Indian demanded from each of the washermen £30, which they agreed to pay. They went to the place of the Indian where they saw a disguised European. He gave them permits and they each paid £30. They were acquitted of the charge of having used false permits as they were not aware that the permits given by the European were false. But on the charge of having resided without a permit, they have been ordered to leave the Transvaal within seven days. It will be interesting to know who this officer may be, for there are various rumours current in the town.
A similar charge was brought against another Indian. It was
 based on the affidavit of some Indian. In deposing before the magistrate, the Indian who had made the affidavit turned hostile to theprosecution. Thereupon the magistrate discharged the accused and sentenced the other Indian for giving false evidence. The case of this gentleman appears to prove the truth of the saying, “He who digs a pit will I himself fall into it.”

415,,CONDITION OF MUSLIMS IN AFGHANISTAN,"
    
 We published some time ago an article by Mr. Saiyed Ali, B.A., on Muslim administration. The second part of that article appeared in the Indian Review of March which we briefly summarize below.
 We have considered Turkey and Iran. Let us now turn to Afghanistan, which has made big advances recently. It can safely be stated that before Amir Abdur Rahman ascended the throne, there was hardly any administration in Afghanistan, though, even then, there were councils called Ulu and Malik. Residents of the various localities in a village sent representatives to a council known as Khel, and the Ulu was elected from out of them. But in those times, owing to the difficult temper of the people, no one could maintain control over the administration. Then thieves had their arms cut off. If a slave tried to run away, he had his legs chopped off. The different provinces were governed by local chieftains and Sardars. Above the Sardars there were Amirs, but the Sardars showed little respect for their authority. The Pathan is by nature an adventurous individual, and so he was quite at home with such unsettled conditions. In those times, punishments such as those described above were the only effective ones. Once a Pathan told General Elphinstonelibtech_564_footnotein reply to a question: “We are content to remain quarrelling; we are not afraid of dangers, and do not grow pale at the sight of blood. Come what may, we will not give up our freedom and submit ourselves to any Emperor.”
 After coming to the throne, Amir Abdur Rahman introduced important changes. He took the utmost advantage of the fact that his kingdom was a buffer State between Russia and England. Sometimes
 
 he would lean towards Russia and sometimes towards England. He would not quarrel openly with either, and in the end, would side with England. This shrewdness of his won the admiration of European statesmen. He always had things to his advantage, but yielded nothing to others in return. In the internal affairs of the kingdom, too, he showed the highest ability, and broke the power of the local chieftains. He reformed the civil law. The annual tribute of twelve lakhs of rupees which he used to receive from the Government of India, later raised to eighteen lakhs, was put to wise use. He formed an army, stocke dammunition and expanded trade. Unnecessary faxes were removed, and a mint was established. The present ruler has raised the status of Afghanistan even further. He has established two councils, named Darbar-e-Shahi and Kwajan Shahi. Under such a political system  even the temper of the Pathans has begun to change. If the present trend continues for long, the warlike Pathan will have established a strong kingdom in the East. All the same, it must be admitted that the people of Afghanistan do not interest themselves in political affairs. Amir Habibullah Khan is an Emperor. He is a brave soldier and a pious man. His Majesty never missed his prayers while in India. We cannot say for certain whether or not he will observe the agreement of 1905. The Amir is now accorded the status of an Emperor and receives a salute of thirty-one guns. He now enjoys the same power that the Shah of Iran does.

             TO  THE 	EDITOR  THE 	STAR  [JOHANNESBURG]  SIR,           P. O. BOX 	3553, [JOHANNESBURG,]  June 	8, 1907 
  	I have seen the Gazette notice today intimating that the 	Asiatic Law Amendment Act has received the Royal sanction, and that 	it will     15-6-1907. 
 come into force on a day to be appointed. I do not know what this means, but it leaves breathing space, and I, therefore, wish to place before the public a mercantile view of the Act. In order to do that, I am obliged to enter into a bit of autobiography. I have been settled in the Transvaal for the last 19 years, and have the honour to represent, as managing partner, the firm of Suliman Ismail Mia and Co. My firm has very large dealings with European wholesale houses, who have need I say, derived very considerable pecuniary profit from their transactions with the firm. It suffered severe reverses during the Jameson Raidlibtech_566_footnotelibtech_567_footnote, and yet its creditors were paid in full. It underwent asimilar ordeal during the Boer War; the creditors were still paid in full. And now, for the third time,complete ruin stares it in the face. In the two previous instances, the cause was beyond human, at any rate my firm’s, control. Today, the cause will be of its own seeking, and why? For the simple reason that the Asiatic Law Amendment ‘Act is considered by every Indian who has understood it as a  mark  of slavery pure and simple. It makes of the Transvaal a prison-house for every Indian, so far as I know my countrymen’s mind. They have, therefore, decided not to submit to such an Act, but to suffer the consequence of such disobedience. It goes against the grain for an Indian to disobey any law, and yet the feeling aroused by this Act is so strong that disobedience is deemed a virtue and obedience a cowardly vice. The position that I, as an Indian merchant, am placed in is the position occupied by many like myself. Do you suppose that all such Indians do not realize the full force and effect of what they stand to lose from a worldly standpoint by disobeying the law? But we have learned at the feet of your countrymen that it is better to suffer such loss than to surrender personal freedom and accept humiliation. Why should I accept cancellation of my title-deeds, and have to go to the Permit Office, hat in hand, and beg for a new title-deed with many restrictions? Moreover, as a Mahomedan, I resent most bitterly that, whereas non Mahomedan subjects of the Turkish Empire are free from the galling yoke of the Act, Mahomedan subjects of that Empire are not. These are facts which I venture to ask you and the public to weigh well.
 I should not have troubled you were it not for the fact that the Government have reserved to themselves yet the right to retire from what is, from the Indian standpoint, a false position. Let the offer of
 
 voluntary re-registration be accepted and, if it fails, a ‘day may be fixed for the compulsory registration of those who have not abided by the voluntary offer. It is true that, under the voluntary offer, there will be no ear-marking of Indian babes, but I must frankly confess that no loss of the good things of this world will deter me from disobeying an Act which means that I shall have to supply identification particulars of a day-old son of mine, and be subject to the tacit assumption that the infant is a future criminal of the direst type. I have spoken to many European friends of mine. They all consider that our offer is very reasonable. I ask you, and them, to support us in our struggle for a respectable existence in the Transvaal. Jesus is as much a prophet of the Mahomedans as he is of the Christians. He has somewhere said: “Do unto others as you would that they should do unto you.” May I ask the Christian Government to follow this wise saying?

GOV 	ERNOR OF THE TRA NSVAA L COL ONY AND THE ORA NGE RIV ER COL ONY,  JOHANNESBURG 	YOUR EXCELLENCY,  I 	have the honour to enclose the original as well as a copy of 	signatures of 60 British Indians of this town protesting against the 	cause of the Indians of this Colony being represented at the 	Colonial Office by Messrs M. K. Gandhi and H. O. Ally and to request 	that Your Excellency will be pleased to transmit same to His 	Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies on which 	subject a petition signed by many British Indians has already been 	sent by Dr. William Godfrey.  I 	have the honour, etc.,  C. 	M. PILLAY  Pretoria 	Archives: L.G. File: 1902-1906 
  
                  [TO  THE TIMES  LON DON]  SIR, APPENDIX 3      COMMON 	ROOM, 	LINCOLN’S INN, W.C.,  [LONDON,  November 15, 1906] 
  We 	notice in 	your issue 	of yesterday's 	date a 	report to 	the effect that Mr. 	Churchill said 	that the 	names of the 	two Indians 	who petitioned 	Lord Elgin 	disclaiming Messrs Gandhi 	and Ally 	as their 	representatives in 	England to 	protest against 	the Asiatic 	Law Amendment Ordinance were Dr. William Godfrey and Mr. C.  M. 	Pillay. As our names are already being confounded with that of our 	brother, we wish to state that we entirely disassociate ourselves 	from his views, his petition and the attitude he has taken up.  We 	repeat again our 	strong protest 	against the Asiatic Law 	Amendment Ordinance of 	the Transvaal which 	petition was sent to 	the Right 	Hon'ble the 	Earl of 	Elgin, His 	Majesty's Principal 	Secretary of State for 	the Colonies, 	on the 	3rd 	November. We 	entirely agree 	with Messrs Gandhi 	and Ally's protest 	in  this 	connection and 	heartily co-operate with 	them in the 	work they are doing.  The line 	of conduct adopted by our brother is inexplicable, as we always saw 	him to be an enthusiastic champion of our countrymen's cause in 	South Africa.  The petition 	misrepresents Mr. Gandhi as a political agitator. We have had the 	pleasure of being associated with him and the Indian work for at 	least 15 years 	and from this intimate knowledge of things, we can take the 	responsibility of saying that his is purely a labour of love and not 	a means to a selfish end.  Yours, 	etc., GEO. V. GODFREY 	JAS. W. GODFREY  Pretoria 	Archives: L.G. File: 1902-1906
