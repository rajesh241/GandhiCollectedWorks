Courtesy: 	Narandas Gandhi      DISCUSSION WITH AGATHA HARRISONlibtech_283_footnote    RAJKOT,  March 	6, 1939  	Somehow I am able to draw the noblest in mankind and that is what 	enables me to maintain my faith in God and human nature.  	I know Kathiawar, the land of Kathis, very brave soldiers, but full 	of intrigue and corruption. How could I clean these Augean stables 	except through this vicarious suffering? If I was what I want to be, 	the fast would not have been necessary. I would not then need to 	argue with anyone. My word would go straight home. Indeed, I would 	not even need to utter the word. The mere will on my part would 	suffice to produce the required effect. But I am painfully aware of 	my limitations. That is why I have to undergo all this to make 	myself heard.     
 The other way, namely, that of civil resistance, I deliberately ruled out in this case, because from what I could see it would have, under the existing circumstances, only served further to arouse the brute in those in power. The aim of a satyagrahi, on the othere hand, always is to put the brute in everyone to sleep. By suffering myself I have saved the suffering on the part of the people which would have been inevitable in case civil resistance was revived.
 There is nothing but an indescribable peace and spiritual exultation within me. There is no trace of ill will in my heart against anybody. I am making a ceaseless, strenuous effort not to be irritated. My heart is overflowing. with goodwill even for Virawala. My fast will be worth while if it serves to move him and the Thakore Saheb to a sense of their responsibility. And, if the Viceroy should in the end decide not to concede my demand, I shall not misunderstand him. I know how difficult it is for Englishmen to grasp the meaning of the fasting method.libtech_284_footnote

  	I have received your kind letter, and as I wanted some points to be 	cleared you were good enough to come to me and discuss them.

I will ask you please to wire the 	following message to His Excellency:  	“I   am  grateful   to   you   for   your   prompt   replylibtech_288_footnotewhich   was delivered to me at 10. 45 today. 	Although naturally it leaves several things unsaid, I regard your 	kind message as sufficient warrant for breaking the fast and ending 	the anxiety of millions who are following the fast with their 	prayers and such effort as they can make to hasten the settlement.  	It is only proper for me to say that those things [which ] are not 	mentioned in your message are not waived by me but that I should 	expect satisfaction on them. They can however await  mutual 	discussion.  	As soon as the doctors permit me to undertake a journey to Delhi I 	shall do so.  	I thank you once more for taking up so promptly and so 	sympathetically the matter that necessitated the fast.  	I hope that the prisoners will be released as soon as possible 	today. I 	await your reply as to publication before breaking the fast.""libtech_289_footnote  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a copy: C.W. 10141. Courtesy: D. B. Kalelkar        p.m. 	It read: 	“. . 	.

   STATEMENT TO THE PRESSlibtech_290_footnote  
 March 7, 1939
 In my opinion this good ending is an answer to the prayers of millions. I claim to know my millions. All the 24 hours of the day I am with them. They are my first care and last, because I recognize no God except the God that is to be found in the hearts of the dumb millions. They do not recognize His presence; I do. And I worship the God that is Truth or Truth which is God through the service of these millions.
 But I also know I had the prayers and sympathy of others all the world over. And there was a persistent effort of the intelligentsia in order to bring about an honourable understanding and a speedy end of this fast. Englishmen have co-operated as well as Indians. Politically speaking, it is His Excellency the Viceroy who is responsible for the settlement.
 I know Englishmen do not understand the method of fast, especially on what would appear to be a purely political issue. They often feel disgusted with such method. I know also there are Indians who do not appreciate the method of fast. I hope, when I am strong, to writelibtech_291_footnoteabout ‘The Fast Method’, because over 50 years’ experience has convinced me that in the plan of satyagraha it has a definite place. The reason why I bring fast here is because I want to give full valuation to the Viceregal gesture, and he represents the English mind. It was open to him—and I at least would have justified his action—If
 he had said: ‘I do not understand this man’s actions. There seems to be no end to his fasts. There must be a stop somewhere. He will give no guarantee that this is his last fast. We propose even this time not to parley with him until he has broken his fast.’
 I know that, ethically speaking, he would have been wrong if he had taken up that attitude, but, politically speaking and examining the position from the English standpoint, I would have justified his action if he had been unbending. I am hoping that such a good ending and appreciation  even   of   a   method  which   the   English   mind  cannot
 
 2.30 to 3.20 Gandhiji dictated a long statement to the Press.”
 
 understand will produce not merely the righting of what I have held to be a primary wrong, but it will clear the atmosphere and help also in the general solution of the States’ problem.
 I do not mean to say that all States will have to follow the Rajkot precedent. Rajkot is a speciality and must be regarded as an isolated case. There are States whose problems must be considered on their merits. But public attention is rivetted on the problem of the States. I hope it will be recognized that it is a problem which does not brook delay.
 I would like the Princes to believe me when I assure them that I came to Rajkot as their friend and as a cent percent peacemaker. I saw that civil resisters in Rajkot were, and could not but be, unyielding. Their honour was at stake. I had tales of atrocities poured into my ears. I felt that the basest human passions would be let loose if I allowed civil resistance to go on from day to day. That would have resulted in a bitter feud not merely between Rajkot and the civil resisters but—as the human mind works and even jumps from the particular to the general—there would have been a bitter feud between the Princes and the people.
 I know that, even as it is, there is a growing school of public opinion in India which is convinced that the Princes are beyond reform, and that there would be no free India unless this ‘relic of a barbaric past’ is done away with. I honestly differ with them, and, as a believer in non-violence and therefore in the goodness of human nature, I could not do otherwise. They have a place in India. It is not possible to wipe out all the traditions of a hoary past. I therefore hold that if the Princes will read from the lessons of the past and will respond to the time spirit, all will be well. But it will not do to tinker with the problem. They will have to take heroic measures. They need not follow the Rajkot model, but they will have to part with real and substantial powers in favour of the people.
 There is, so far as I am aware, no via media of saving the situation and saving India from a terrible blood feud. I dare not publish the letters that I have received about the Princes, but of this I shall have to speak more later. In my present weak state of health it is an effort to give this statement. And yet whilst the effect of the fast is on me and whilst I am full of what I call spiritual exultation, I must give out the best of my thoughts just now.
 Then there are the Bhayatslibtech_292_footnoteand Garasiaslibtech_293_footnote. They pleaded with me their case. I told them that they had my sympathy. They could count upon me as their friend. I want them also to live as Garasias and Bhayats, but they will also have to march with the times. They will have to remodel their lives. They will have to feel one with the people over whom they exercise a kind of sway.
 Our Mussalman friends came to me, and I had no hesitation in telling them without any argument that their special interests would be safeguarded, that if they wanted separate electorates in Rajkot with reservation of seats I would see to it that they got them. Without their asking they would have had ample guarantees for the fullest protection of their religious freedom. And I told them that if they insisted upon their nominations, I would not resist them. It  is  necessary for me to say this in order to ease their minds and to ease the minds of the Mussalmans throughout India. I want them to feel that neither I nor the Congress can ever be guilty of diminishing an iota of the safeguards that they may need for their full growth and for the protection of their faith and culture.
 I must explain why I have released for publication only the Viceregal telegraphic message received today at 10·45 a.m. and my reply. There is an allusion to previous messages in these two communications. With the full consent of the Viceroy, I am refraining from publishing those communications. His Excellency has not prevented me from publishing them. I know that he does not believe in sending secret communications to public men, but, for reasons which I need not go into, I felt the force of the argument that, for the sake of the cause, it is not wise to publish them. I hope that it will never be necessary to publish them. There are in my communications allusions which were relevant, but they are not for the public. Hence the responsibility for withholding previous communications is solely mine.
 One word about the Congress. My heart is there, but I see that I will not be able to reach there. I am still too weak but, what is more, if   I am to give the finishing touch to the Rajkot matter and what it implies, I must not divide my attention between Tripuri and Rajkot. I must concentrate my attention solely on Rajkot at present. I have work
 
 
 to do here. I must hasten to Delhi as soon as I am able. I only hope that all will go well in Tripuri.
 It is a strange experience for me to miss the Congress session through all these years. But it is a good thing. Why should I be so proud as to think that nothing serious can be done without me? There are leaders in Tripuri who are every whit as courageous, as self- sacrificing and as devoted as I am. I have no doubt, therefore, that though another policy may be evolved, there will be no acrimony and there will be no violence in their thoughts, in their words and in their deeds.
 The last thing I would like to say is that I want to thank the Press correspondents who have been with me during all these anxious days. I have felt proud of them. They have carried out the best traditions of good journalism. They have not been newsmongers but they have been fellow-messengers of peace with me. They have shown me the greatest consideration. They have never pestered me.
 I should like also publicly to thank my medical friends who have so ungrudgingly attended upon me.
 I hope that the prayers of those who believe in them will still continue. In a way, my work begins from now. I begin to lead an earthly life. I have to carry on delicate negotiations. I do not want to lose the goodwill with which I am surcharged at the present moment. I think of the Thakore Saheb, I think of Durbar Shri Virawala. I have criticized them. but only as a friend. I repeat that I am in the place of  a father to the Thakore Saheb. I have done no more towards him than  I could have done to my truant son. I would like them to understand the significance of what has gone on in front of them, and it would be a noble ending to this fast if I discover that they have appreciated all that I have said as from a friend, and that there will be the response from them that I expect.
 Rajkot is the hub of Kathiawar, and if Rajkot is given a popular government, other States in Kathiawar will of their own accord and without any further civil resistance fall in line. There is no such thing as perfect coincidences on this earth. Its beauty lies  in  its multitudinous variety. There will be, therefore, variety of constitutions in Kathiawar States. But let the trunk be true.

Not one of the terms of your ultimatum to the Thakore 	Saheb has been fulfilled except the release of prisoners. But you 	never took the fast for their release.’  	On the surface this argument is perfect. It is consistent with a 	vengeance. My answer is, ‘The letter killeth; the spirit giveth 	life.’ The life-giving fact is that Rajkot has become an all-India 	issue and the place of the Thakore Saheb has been taken up by the 	Viceroy whose word I have no reason to doubt. Even if the Thakore 	Saheb had granted all my terms, I should not have been sure of due 	fulfilment,       
 though I would have been obliged to accept them. What I have deliberately put in doubt is the meaning of the famous letterlibtech_303_footnotelibtech_304_footnotegiven to the Sardar. In my ultimatum I had acted on the assumption that it bore only one meaning. But as a satyagrahi I must always allow my cards to be examined and re-examined at all times and  make reparation if an error is discovered. Hence my reading of the  settlement is that God has given me much more than I had ever expected. Time will show whether my claim is justified.

   TALK WITH AGATHA HARRISONlibtech_305_footnote  
 March 8, 1939 Agatha had an interesting talk with Gandhiji in the morning and then in the afternoon. In the course of it she asked him the question, “Now that the Paramount
 Power has been appealed to intervene, would it be consistent with this attitude to go on with the anti-imperialist cry? In other words, would it be right  from  your  viewpoint to make use of the machinery set up by the imperialist power whilst you are pledged to the anti-imperialist goal ?”
 Gandhiji explained to her that the inconsistency to which she referred was in appearance only. Non-violent non-co-operation did not mean mechanical isolation or complete avoidance of contact with the opponent under all conditions. In seeking intervention of the Paramount Power he had put the Paramount Power on the trial and given it a chance to do the right thing.
The Paramount Power has so far constantly been helping the
 Princes in their misrule. But it owes also an obligation to the people. The people of Rajkot have now asked the Paramount Power to meet that obligation. Not to do so when an opportunity occurs would be not non-co-operation, it would be folly. It may even lead to the strengthening of the Paramount Power. Although non-co-operation is one of the main weapons in the armoury of satyagraha, it should not be forgotten that it is after all only a means to secure the co-operation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice. The essence of non-violence technique is that it seeks to liquidate antagonisms but not the antagonists themselves. In non-violent fight you have to a certain measure to conform to the traditions and conventions of the system you are pitted against. Avoidance of all relationship with the opposing power, therefore, can never be a satyagrahi’s object, but transformation or purification of that relationship. The people of Rajkot would never be able to end the dominance of the Paramount Power through non-violent means if they said, ‘We shall not touch it even with a pair of tongs; we shall refuse to meet it even for the sake of converting it.’
 The field of co-operation between the Paramount Power and the people of the States was likely to grow rather than diminish with the growth of non-violent strength and consciousness among the people. In fact he foresaw a time when the Residents and Political Agents in Indian States would become true trustees and servants of the people on behalf of the Paramount Power and be made use of by them
 
 as such.
 The Congress had advised the country to boycott the reformed legislatures at the beginning of the non-co-operation movement. It regarded them as a trap and a snare. But as a result of phenomenal awakening that had taken place among the masses as a result of the schooling they got through successive civil disobedience campaigns, and the ensuing relative transformation of relationship between them and the Government, in 1937 it decided to capture the machinery of Government in the seven provinces where the Congress commanded a majority.
 His seeking the intervention of the Paramount Power in the present case, therefore, did not necessarily imply any fundamental change in his outlook. On the contrary it was a further step towards the ending of that system as it exists and functions today.

  	As I am now comparatively less weak, I have begun to gather threads 	of information. You will agree that repressive measures, whether by 	way of Notifications or acts done under them or reprisals outside 	Notifications, should be cancelled. I collect a few out of a long 	list submitted to me.    Bans 				on persons. Bans 				on newspapers. Bans 				on organizations. Confiscations 				and fines. Closing 				of schools 				and dispensaries. Sale 				of movable 				and immovable property.  Grains 				belonging to 				the cultivators not 				allowed to be 				removed.         
    Increase 			in student’s 			fees and water charges. Deprivation 			of freeships.   
 You will please see to the rectification of these matters. If you think that it is necessary to see me before you could take any action I am at your disposal.
 Doctors have prohibited journeying before Monday next. I, therefore, propose to leave for Delhi on Monday evening.
 Yours sincerely,

     APPEAL TO PEOPLE OF RAJKOTlibtech_311_footnote    
 March 9, 1939
 Through the grace of God, the object of my coming to Rajkot has been fulfilled. The Thakore Saheb, and with his consent the Paramount Power, have given assurance that the Thakore Saheb’s  word will be honoured and Rajkot will have a constitution in terms of the Notification of 26th December 1938. This is the simple and common-sense interpretation of the telegraphic communications between H. E. the Viceroy and myself. The result has surpassed all my expectations. The honour of both the Ruler and the ruled has been vindicated and the sufferings of the people have borne fruit. Let us all offer our thanks to the Almighty. Such a happy ending would have been impossible without His grace and intervention.
 I would not go into the other points mentioned in my letter to the Thakore Saheb. I gave not given them up. It should be sufficient for all concerned to know that I am aware of the fact that restrictions on the Press and other repressive measures have not been withdrawn. My efforts for their withdrawal continue, and I am sure they will go shortly.
 Let us not indulge in exultation over this settlement. The real work will begin now only. Responsible government will come, but will the people be able to shoulder the burden and rise equal to their task? If they are to give a proper account of themselves, they will have to begin preparing from today. They would not need, for this purpose, to hold meetings and deliver speeches. If meetings are held at all, they
 
 
 should be for the purpose of educating the public. Every citizen of Rajkot will have to contribute his or her mite if success is to crown our efforts.
 There 	should be real 	Hindu-Muslim unity.  The 	canker of 	untouchability and the 	distinction  between 	high and low 	must be uprooted from 	the heart 	of the Hindu 	community.  It 	should be 	realized that 	we have 	no other 	sanction at our 	disposal except that 	of truth 	and non-violence. We 	should, therefore, 	understand their working 	in our 	everday dealings. The 	public should cultivate 	the spirit 	of corporate service.  Young 	men and women 	in thier numbers 	should come forward 	to dedicate 	their lives to the 	service of 	the people.  We 	must rid ourselves 	of petty 	jealousies and 	bickerings and 	learn to 	be disciplined.  The 	people should shed their 	lethargy and occupy 	themselves with 	some useful activity 	like spinning, 	etc. Everyone 	should take the 	vow of khadi.  Those 	who are educated 	should help their 	illiterate brethren 	to read 	and write.

     TALK WITH RAJKOT PRAJA PARISHAD WORKERSlibtech_312_footnote    
 March 9, 1939
 One of the workers had admitted in the course of his talk that he accepted non- violence as a policy, not as his creed. Gandhiji explained to him that he could be satisfied with that provided the acceptance was whole-hearted and sincere. It must be without any mental reservations. The greater danger was that although many people professed to believe in non-violence, not all of them meant the same thing by that term. Himsa did not merely mean indulgence in physical violence; resort to trickery, falsehood, intrigue, chicanery and deceitfulness—in short, all unfair and foul means—came under the category of himsa, and acceptance of ahimsa whether as a policy or a creed necessarily implied renunciation of all these things.
 A votary of ahimsa had therefore to be incorruptible, fair and square in his
 
 
 dealings, truthful, straightforward and utterly selfless. He must have also true humility. It was of the utmost importance, therefore, that there should  be  no confusion or misunderstanding as to the meaning or implications of non-violence. The controversy about ‘creed’ or ‘policy’ could be put aside if there was a clear, common understanding on this point.

      STATEMENT TO THE PRESSlibtech_319_footnote          RAJKOT, 
  March 11, 1939 Having been out of touch with 	everything since my leaving Segaon, that is, for nearly a fortnight, 	I do not feel competent to give a decisive 	opinion upon the impending resumption of civil resistance in  	Travancore. But I have no difficulty in stating certain general 	principles. The first indispensable condition precedent to any civil 	resistance is that there should be surety against any outbreak of 	violence whether on the part of those who are identified with civil 	resistance or on the part of the general public. It would be no 	answer in the case of an outbreak of violence that it was instigated 	by the State or other agencies hostile to civil resisters. It should 	be obvious that civil resistance cannot flourish in an atmosphere of 	violence. This does not mean that the resources of a satyagrahi have 	come to an end. Ways other than civil disobedience should be found 	out. The second condition is that disobedience should not be 	destructive, that is, harmful to the country. The laws to be picked 	up, therefore, should be those which are harmful to the people or 	laws whose breach will not harm the people but are likely merely to 	make more work for the authorities. Thirdly, it must be a movement 	in which the largest number of people can take part. Fourthly, 	students should not be invited or allowed to take part in civil 	resistance. There should be no secrecy. Civil resisters must conform 	to the minimum requirements that may be laid down for the sake of 	discipline or otherwise.libtech_320_footnote  Asked 	why he called the 	students to 	come out 	of the 	colleges and 	schools in 	1921 and 	to participate 	in non-co-operation 	and why he was opposed 	 now  to students’ 	participation in the 	civil resistance 	movement, Gandhiji explained that 	the position 	then was different. 	He asked 	the students 	to empty 	the colleges 	and schools 	as signifying 	complete non-co-operation 	with the Government. 	The  moment 	 a student 	came out of the college, 	he became 	a citizen—when 	he was free 	to participate 	in the 	movement. Gandhiji 	would have no quarrel if students left the colleges 	altogether and 	participated in 	the movement.  Harijan 	18-3-1939; also The 	Hindu, 11-3-1939     
     TALK WITH WORKERS OF RAJKOT PRAJA 				PARISHAD    
 March 12,  1939 I think the initial mistake was made when all Kathiawaris were permitted to join Rajkot Satyagraha. That step introduced an element
of weakness in the fight. Thereby we put our reliance on numbers,
 whereas a satyagrahi relies solely upon God who is the help of the helpless. A satyagrahi always says to himself, ‘He, in whose name satyagraha was launched, will also see it through.’ If the people of Rajkot had thought in these terms, there would have been no temptation to organize big processions or mass demonstrations and probably there would have been no atrocities such as Rajkot has had to experience. A genuine satyagrahi proceeds by setting the opponent at his ease. His action never creates panic in the breast of the ‘enemy’. Supposing as a result of rigid enforcement of the rules of satyagrahis Rajkot satyagraha had been confined to a few hundred or even a few score true satyagrahis and they had carried on their satyagraha in the right spirit till their last breath, theirs would have served as a heroic example.
 I shall soon be going to Delhi as your representative. I shall not be able to proceed with my work with self-confidence or to speak with authority unless I have the confidence that we shall be able  to  vindicate and do justice to the devolution of power into the hands of the people that we are fighting for. As a lifelong devotee and votary of truth, I know that my pleading will be ineffectual, it will lack power, unless it has the double backing of faith on my part in the inherent justice of the cause that I represent and in the capacity and sincerity of purpose of those who represent this cause. The question that you must seriously set yourself to answer is: ‘What shall we do with swaraj, supposing we got it today?’libtech_321_footnote
 You want democracy—the rule of the people, by the people, for the people. Surely, all the 75,000 people of Rajkot cannot become rulers or administrators. Democracy must in essence, therefore, mean the art and science of mobilizing the entire physical, economic and
 
 spiritual resources of all the various sections of the people in the service of the common good of all.
 Service of the family has been the motive behind all our activities hitherto. We must now learn to broaden our outlook so as to include in our ambit the service of the people as a whole.
 We are familiar with several conceptions of village work. Hitherto it has mostly meant propaganda in the villages to inculcate upon the village masses a sense of their rights. Sometimes it has also meant conducting welfare activitiy among them to ameliorate their material condition. But the village work that I have now come to place before you consists in educating the villager in his duties.
 Rights accrue automatically to him who duly performs his  duties. In fact the right to perform one’s duties is the only right that is worth living for and dying for. It covers all legitimate rights. All the rest is garb under one guise or another and contains in it seeds of himsa.
 The swaraj of my conception will come only when all of us are firmly persuaded that our swaraj has got to be won, worked and maintained through truth and ahimsa alone. True democracy or the swaraj of the masses can never come through untruthful and violent means, for the simple reason that the natural corollary to their use would be to remove all opposition through  the suppression or extermination of the antagonists. That does not make for individual freedom. Individual freedom can have the fullest play only under a regime of unadulterated ahimsa.
 We cannot afford to have discord in our midst if we are to educate the people. We must all speak with one voice. If we want to weld the various sections into one people—and that is the sine qua non of democracy—we may not, in rendering service, make any distinction between those who took part in our struggle and those who did not.libtech_322_footnote

     FASTING    
 Fasting in an institution as old as Adam. It has been resorted to for self-purification or for some ends noble as well as ignoble. Buddha, Jesus and Mahomed fasted so as to see God face to face. Ramachandra fasted for the sea to give way for his army of monkeys. Parvati fasted to secure Mahadev Himself as her Lord and Master. In my fasts I have but followed these great examples no doubt for ends much less noble than theirs.
 I do not propose to discuss the merits of my recent fast beyond answering a suggestion whether I left Segaon with the knowledge that I was going to fast. I have become a coward of late for fasting. My fast in August 1933though short-lived was a perfect torture to me. I had prepared for death the very day I was discharged. I had made over many of my medical stores to the nurse in charge. Since then I have dreaded fasts. The twenty-four-hour annual fasts of 6thlibtech_323_footnotelibtech_324_footnoteand 13thlibtech_325_footnoteApril have shown me since then that my system is ill able to undergo any protracted fasting. Therefore when I left Segaon there could be no question of my light-heartedly thinking ahead of any fast in Rajkot. Had I made any such resolution, I was bound by a promise to friends that I should give them due notice. Thus there could be no pre-meditation. It came upon me all of a sudden and out of the intense agony of the soul. The days preceding the fast were days of deepest prayer. The experience of the night before the determination to take the fast had choked me. I did not know what to do. The morning following told me what I was to do, cost what it might. I simply could not have taken the resolution but for the belief that God wanted me to take it.
So much for the Rajkot fast.
 Fasting is a potent weapon in the satyagraha armoury. It cannot be taken by everyone. Mere physical capacity to take it is no qualification for it. It is of no use without a living faith in God. It should never be a mechanical effort nor a mere imitation. It must
 
 come from the depth of one’s soul. It is therefore always rare. I seem to be made for it. It is noteworthy that not one of my colleagues on the political field has felt the call to fast. And I am thankful to be able to say that they have never resented my fasts. Nor have fellow- members of the Ashram felt the call except on rare occasions. They have even accepted the restriction that they may not take penitential fasts without my permission, no matter how urgent the inner call may seem to be.
 Thus fasting though a very potent weapon has necessarily very strict limitations and is to be taken only by those who have undergone previous training. And, judged by my standard, the majority of fasts do not at all come under the category of satyagraha fasts and are, as they are popularly called, hunger strikes undertaken without previous preparation and adequate thought. If the process is repeated too often, these hunger-strikes will lose what little efficacy they may possess and will become objets of ridicule.
 RAJKOT, March 13, 1939
 Harijan, 18-3-1939
 
     APPEAL TO PEOPLE OF RAJKOT libtech_326_footnote    
 
March   13, 1939
 In swaraj based on ahimsa people need not know their rights, but it is necessary for them to know their duties. There is no duty but creates a corresponding right, and those only are true rights which flow from a due performance of one’s duties. Hence rights of true citizenship accrue only to those who serve the State to which they belong. And they alone can do justice to the rights that accrue to them. Everyone possesses the right to tell lies or resort to goondaism. But the exercise of such a right is harmful both to the exerciser and society. But to him who observes truth and non-violence comes prestige, and prestige brings rights. And people who obtain rights as a result of performance of duty, exercise them only for the service of society, never for themselves. Swaraj of a people means the sum total
 
 of the swaraj (self-rule) of individuals. And such swaraj comes only from performance by individuals of their duty as citizens. In it no one thinks of his rights. They come, when they are needed, for better performance of duty.
 Whilst I was expounding these views to a meeting of workers it was decided that volunteers should be called for who would go to the villages and tell the people what under swaraj they would be expected to do. Thus men or women who would go to the villages would tell the village people that it would be their duty to keep their village clean and make them self-supporting. They must not expect the swaraj government to do these things for them. Our villages are on the verge of destruction owing to the disappearance of village industries. They can be revivified only by a revival of village industries. Among these industries the spinning-wheel occupies the centre. The others easily arrange themselves around the wheel. If the people of Rajkot realize their duty, they would wear khadi of their own spinning. Thus everybody will learn the value of industry, and if all will engage in industries conducive to the welfare of the State, several lakhs of rupees will be saved for the people by the people. And it can be shown that by putting into practice the ideal of self-help and self-sufficiency they will have to pay the lowest taxes and realize a greater degree of happiness in the sum than is possible under any other system. Those who labour for the State pay their taxes just as much as those that pay them in coin. Coins are but a measure of labour performed. They have no other value. If I buy a rupee worth of flour, I have paid for the labour of cultivation, carrying and grinding. Therefore, the real owner of wealth is one who puts in a certain amount of labour with a conscious productive aim. It is the same thing whether I pay the State one rupee or its equivalent of labour as tax. Often it will be found that payment in labour is of greater value to the State than payment in coin. Payment in labour invigorates the nation. Where people perform labour voluntarily for the service of society, exchange of money becomes unnecessary. The labour of collecting the taxes and keeping accounts is saved and the results are equally good.
 Every man and woman should be educated along the lines mentioned above. The property of the State is the property of the people, the Thakore Saheb is their trustee. As trustee the Thakore Saheb and other members of his family should perform their duty. Through the performance of their duty to the State they earn the right of taking a certain amount of money from the State. If the Ruler and
 the ruled perform their duty in this way, there is no room for mutual bitterness.
 Under responsible government everyone, from the king to the poorest citizen, must prosper. Under swaraj based on non-violence nobody is anybody’s enemy, everybody contributes his or her due quota to the common goal, all can read and write, and their knowledge keeps growing from day to day. Sickness and disease are reduced to the minimum. No one is a pauper and labour can always find employment. There is no place under such a government for gambling, drinking and immorality or for class hatred. The rich will use their riches wisely and usefully, and not squander them in increasing their pomp and worldly pleasures. It should not happen that a handful of rich people should live in jewelled palaces and the millions in miserable hovels devoid of sunlight or ventilation.
 Hindu-Muslim differences, untouchability, vertical differences between high and low, these must not be. I have referred to these in the previous leaflet. It is necessary here, perhaps, to say a word about the Girasias and the Bhayats. They are also a limb of the people. Swarajists have to show to them that they have nothing to fear from the former. In non-violent swaraj there can be no encroachment upon just rights; contrariwise no one can possess unjust rights. In a well- organized State, usurpation should be an impossibility and it should be unnecessary to resort to force for dispossessing a usurper. But some Garasia friends have begun to fear the Congress. But if they use their garas as trustees and are or become industrious, they have no cause for fear. The congress cannot keep its prestige if it tramples upon just rights. Its prestige is solely due to its ceaseless efforts to secure universal good. The conference of the Garasias is in session at Rajkot at the present moment. They had an orderly procession today, part of which I witnessed from my bed. A volunteer wrote down for me the maxims inscribed on their banners. They are so good as to arrest attention. Here they are :
  Educate 	yourselves, abstain from 	spirituous liquors 	and cultivate simplicity. Garasdars 	believe in constructive programme. Say not mine is right, but say what is right is mine. Avoid 	pomp, jealousy and bad habits. We do not believe in encroaching upon other people’s rights. It 	is our duty to protect the afflicted. 
 
  Forgiveness 	is the 	virtue of 	the strong. Speak 	only that which has value 	and never 	a word thoughtlessly. Be 	manly if you will be free. 
 May the association have the strength to put their maxims into practice.
 The programme that I have sketched above can be carried out only if Rajkot puts forth worthy young men and women for it. They must have faith in it. We have not sufficiently cultivated the habit of silent service. We must cultivate it. I asked for a band of such silent workers at yesterday’s meeting. They gave me their names. If they have a living faith in truth and non-violence and will do their work with full concentration, the people of Rajkot will certainly be able to shoulder the responsibility that is coming to them. The names that were given to me are as follows :
  Shri 	Uchharangrai N. Dhebar, Shri 	Jethalal H. Joshi Shri 	Popatlal P. Anada, Shri 	Ramjibhai Manekchand Doshi, Shri 	Saubhagyachand Virchand Modi, Shri 	Jamnadas Shah. 
 The reader will see from the names that those who have not an abiding faith in truth and non-violence have wisely kept themselves aloof. But they have assured me that they will not oppose the programme to be chalked out by this band in terms of this leaflet. They have further assured me that they will willingly perform such tasks as may be entrusted to them if they can conscientiously do so. I congratulate these workers upon their restraint and patriotism.

   DISCUSSION WITH HARIBHAU UPADHYAYA AND 		OTHER WORKERS libtech_327_footnote  
 March 14, 1939
 Gandhiji, after giving them a careful hearing. explained to them his idea about ‘intensification’. They had broken virgin soil in launching upon satyagraha  in Jaipur. The popular response had exceeded their anticipations and even expectations. So far so good. But it was bad horsemanship to run a good horse to death. Instead of seeking further to spread out the volume they should now set to deepen the  foundations and inculcate inward strength. He proposed some stringent tests and preparatory training as an indispensable condition for participation in satyagraha hereafter. Pending the attainment of the minimum standard laid down by him the civil disobedience part of satyagraha might remain suspended; that would not mean suspension of satyagraha itself. He invited them to Delhi for further discussion, if it was thought necessary.

   LETTER TO SIR REGINALD M. MAXWELL  
 NEW DELHI
 March  [15 ]libtech_329_footnotelibtech_330_footnote, 1939
 DEAR SIR REGINALD,
 Owing to the facilities kindly given to me I was able to see the three prisoners on hunger-strike in the Delhi Jail and I am glad to be able to say that they accepted my advice and gave it up—perhaps it is more correct to say suspended it. I tried to persuade them to give the assurance required by the Government. But they said they did not want to purchase their freedom by giving any undertaking. They were prisoners without any trial and so they should be discharged without any condition as so many others have been discharged. I felt the force of their objection. But I told them that in order to enable me to work for their release, they should give me satisfaction that they believed in the Congress policy of non-violence and that they would work under the Congress. This they readily agreed to do, and they gave me, too, a letter reducing their assurance to writing. But they wanted to make it plain to me that I was not to use that letter for securing their freedom, nor to ask the Government to discharge them on the strength of that letter. I wish you could see your way to discharge these prisoners unconditionally. If you do so it will strengthen my hands in the prosecution of my mission of non- violence on the political field.
 I see in the letter that was sent to me by Mr. Pucklelibtech_331_footnoteanother condition that they should not enter this or that province. Surely it is a superfluous condition. If the Governments of the provinces concerned do not want them to remain within their Jurisdiction they would issue orders of prohibition. Why should the Government of India attach those conditions?
 I am sending this letter with Mahadev Desai so that he can give you, if you require it, a graphic description of the conversation that
 
 took place between the three prisoners and myself.

Yours sincerely,
      LETTER TO LORD LINLITHGOW    BIRLA 	HOUSE, 	NEW DELHI,  March 	  15, 1939   I 		had hoped 		to send 		you this letter in 		the afternoon. 		But from 		the Viceroy’s Houselibtech_332_footnotelibtech_333_footnoteI went directly to the prisoners in the Delhi Jail who 		were hunger-striking. 		Contrary to 		my expectations I 		had to 		be with 		them for full 		two hours. 		I am 		happy to 		be able to 		say that 		they listened 		to me and 		broke their fast in 		my presence. They 		were being forcibly fed. I am now writinglibtech_334_footnotelibtech_335_footnoteto Sir Reginald  Maxwell about their discharge.  I 		now reduce 		to writing 		what I 		tried to 		explain in 		the course 		of our conversation. As I read your telegramlibtech_336_footnotelibtech_337_footnote,  the Chief Justicelibtech_338_footnotelibtech_339_footnoteis to interpret the letterlibtech_340_footnotelibtech_341_footnotegiven to  Sardar 		 Vallabhbhai  Patel  on 		 the  26th 		December last 		by the 		Thakore Saheb. 		Assuming that 		it accords 		with our 		contention, the 		Committee has then to 		be set up with 		seven nominees of 		the Sardar 		and three officials 		nominated by the 		Thakore Saheb, the 		Thakore Saheb selecting 		the President 		of the 		Committee out 		of the ten.  The 		next thing contemplated 		in your 		telegram is 		that if 		there is 		a difference 		of opinion 		between the Sardar’s 		nominees on the 		one hand  and  the  officials  on 		  the  otherlibtech_342_footnoteas  to  the  meaning  of 		  the          C. 	J. will do; e. 	g., C. 	J. may interpret 	Notification as meaning 	President in addition 	to ten members”.  
 Notification of 26th December, the Chief Justice is to be the referee whose decision will be final. This as I read your telegram is its technical meaning, so far as the two references to the Chief Justice are concerned. So far as the framing of the constitution is concerned, the majority decision should prevail.
  This 	letter need 	not go further 	so far 	as my promise 	to write 	to you 	on the 	two points raised by 	me is concerned. But 	perhaps it 	is fair to 	you for me 	to draw your attention 	to the 	fact that the 	advisers of the Thakore Saheb have committedlibtech_343_footnotelibtech_344_footnotehim to certain nominations, from 	which commitment 	it might 	be embarrassing 	even for 	the Paramount 	power to recede. 	I refer 	to the nominations 	of two Mussalman 	members and one Bhayat. 	Perhaps you are aware 	of this 	difficulty and 	also of the 	several ways 	out that I have 	suggested. If 	you are not, 	I shall 	be glad 	to explain 	them to 	you. As 	I reflect 	upon our 	conversation, it 	seems to 	me that it 	was inconclusive in 	more ways 	than one. Consideration for 	your time was 	weighing heavily upon 	me, and 	as everything 	else, as 	I thought, 	appeared to you 	to be smooth- 	sailing, I 	did not wish 	to tax 	you any further. You 	will agree that there 	should be no 	misunderstanding about 	the several 	steps that have to 	be taken for 	implementing the 	conditions in 	terms of 	which I 	broke the 	fast. It 	would be 	terrible if 	it becomes my 	duty to 	object to 	any step 	after it 	is announced. I 	therefore suggest that 	I should 	be made 	aware beforehand of the announcement or announce-mentslibtech_345_footnotelibtech_346_footnotethat may have to 	be made in 	connection with the 	Rajkot affair.  And 	there are, as 	I mentioned 	to you, 	several other 	matters brought 	out by 	me in what has 	been termed 	my ultimatum 	to the Thakore 	Saheb and about 	which assurance has 	been given to 	me in your 	two telegrams. Another 	conversation between us 	seems to 	me to be 	necessary for 	a proper 	and final 	elucidation of 	the various 	points arising out of the interchange of the telegrams between uslibtech_347_footnotelibtech_348_footnote. As I think over 	the hurried talk 	that you gave me about 	the States 	in general 	and the 	policy you 	contemplate to 	adopt in 	the immediate 	future, a feeling 	of disturbance 	creeps over 	me. I 	do not 	want to 	reduce to 	writing, unless you desire otherwise, the vague fear that is seizing hold of me 
 
 on the assumption that I have understood you correctly. I would therefore like to have the interview for this purpose also.
Could you please send me a time?libtech_349_footnote

    DISCUSSION WITH PHILIPOSE libtech_350_footnote       DELHI, 
  March 	15, 1939  	Satyagraha does not begin and end with civil disobedience. Let us do 	a little more tapascharya which is the essence of satyagraha. 	Suspension thus conceived can never do harm to the movement. The 	opponent will find that his battery is exhausted when we do not act 	up to his expectation, refuse to have any firework displays or put  	ourselves at his disposal for brutal assaults of his goondas. We 	must meet all his provocative and repressive measures with a 	coolness and an exemplary self-restraint even at the risk of being 	charged with cowardice. If there is no cowardice in us, we are safe; 	ours will ultimately be reckoned an act of rare bravery.  	Meanwhile we should watch how things shaps themselves. I am thinking 	out new plans of conducting the movement in view of the terrorist 	methods that some States seem to have adopted, We have to develop 	that technique of rendering futile the employment of hired hooligans 	against peaceful citizens.  	An able general always gives battle in his own time on the  ground 	of his choice. He always retains the initiative in these respects 	and never allows it to pass into the hands of the enemy.  	In a satyagraha campaign the mode of fight and the choice of 	tactics, e. g., whether to advance or retreat, offer civil 	resistance or     
 organize non-violent strength through constructive work and purely selfless humanitarian service, are determined according to the exigen- cies of the situation. A satyagrahi must carry out whatever plan is laid out for him with a cool determination giving way to neither excite- ment nor depression.
 For a satyagrahi there can be only one goal, viz., to lay down his life performing his duty whatever it may be. It is the highest he can attain. A cause that has such worthy satyagrahi soldiers at its back can never be defeated.

   INTERVIEW TO GOBIND BIHARI LALlibtech_355_footnote

 Gandhiji started the interview about America and my personal experience in my adopted country... He talked to me in Hindustani, the national language of India. He said:
You have not forgotton our language? Not even after a quarter
 century spent in the United States? That is gratifying indeed.
 In reply to my first question... Gandhiji tensely retorted :
India is not far from political independence, pure and simple.
 Mahatma Gandhi said not a word of anger against the British Government. He emphasized the fact that now the real problem of India’s freedom and advancement was one of self-organization... He pointed out :
 The outsiders may not realize the fact that the majority of the provinces of British India (as distinct from the parts ruled by the Princes) are now administered by the Nationalists, by Ministers of the Congress Party. That roughly shows that the Nationalist movement is already in the seats of political power in this country.
 The great question now was of the Government of India as a whole. When the Central or Federal Government came into the hands of the Indians, India would become like Ireland—virtually an independent country. But according to Mahatma Gandhi, and the Nationalists, the scheme of Federation evolved by the British Government in 1935 was not the one to give self-government to India. He said :
The present Federation scheme cannot be accepted without
 damaging the cause of India’s independence. The Viceroy will try to have the scheme accepted. The Nationalists, many of the Princes, religious fanatics and others will oppose it—for diverse reasons. It is a very tense situation. The Indian atmosphere is in fact heavy with impending storms.
 QUESTIONS : What will Nationalist India do if war comes?
GANDHIJI : I cannot answer in advance. But this is certain that a
 
 free India will join hands with other real democracies, and will always help in promoting the cause of democracy and humanism throughout the world.
 I was curious to know how under his guidance, employing a new technique of non-militant rebellion, he has integrated millions of Indians in a fervent struggle for “self-rule”. He explained :
Real self-rule is emancipation from India’s own traditional
 inequalities as well as from those imposed from outside.

   DISCUSSION WITH HYDERABAD ARYASAMAJ 		LEADERSlibtech_357_footnote  
 March 16, 1939
 Mixing up of motives is damaging in any species of satyagraha, but in religious satyagraha it is altogether inadmissible. It is fatal to use or allow religious satyagraha to be used as a cloak or a device for advancing an ulterior political or mundane objective.
 As with regard to the goal so with the means, unadulterated purity is of the very essence in this species of satyagraha. The leader in such a movement must be a man of deeply spiritual life, preferably a brahmachari—whether married or unmarried. He must be a believer in—as in fact everybody participating in such a movement must be— and practiser of the particular religious observance for which the movement is launched. The leader must be versed in the science of satyagraha. Truth and ahimsa should shine through his speech. All his actions must be transparent through and through. Diplomacy and intrigue can have no place in his armoury. Absolute belief in ahimsa and in God is an indispensable condition in such satyagraha.
 In religious satyagraha there can be no room for aggressiveness, demonstrativeness,  show.  Those who  take  part in  it  must  have equal respect and regard for the religious convictions and susceptibilities of those who profess a different faith from theirs. The slightest narrowness in their outlook is likely to be reflected magnified
 
 
 multifold in the opponent.
 Religious satyagraha is, above all, a process of self-purification. It disdains mere numbers and external aids since these cannot add to the satyagrahi’s self-purification. Instead, it relies utterly on God who is the fountain-head of all strength. Religious satyagraha, therefore, best succeeds under the leadership of a true man of God who will compel reverence and love even of the opponent by the purity of his life, the utter selflessness of his mission and the breadth of his outlook.libtech_358_footnote

   LETTER TO LORD LINLITHGOW  
 BIRLA HOUSE, NEW DELHI,
 March  18, 1939
 DEAR LORD LINLITHGOW,
 I hope you will not say, ‘Oh ye of little faith’. My faith in you is abundant, but I am filled with the fear that you have not visualized my difficulty about Rajkot. There is an air of unreality about the freedom to come. The people of Rajkot are used to the utmost freedom of expression of opinion and of action, so long as it is non- violent. But today on the eve of getting self-government they have practically no liberty. A copy of a telegramlibtech_365_footnotelibtech_366_footnotereceived from there is already in front of you. Here is copy of another :
 Khan Saheb (First Member of the Council) orally informs that he considers Seva Mandal literacy campaign undesirable in existing circumstances and desires its stoppage till negotiations over. Dhebar.
If the people of Rajkot cannot enjoy ordinary liberty today, how
 will they two or three weeks hence get full liberty? In order that the whole thing may not end in a catastrophe, I suggest that you ask the Resident to take full charge and make himself responsible  for preparing the way for popular control. Supposing that there is  a proper constitution framed, there is no one in Rajkot to deliver the goods, the invisible hand of Durbar Virawala will deliver nothing. I suppose you know that he has no official status, if he told me the truth.
Pray pardon me for this infliction, and that too on a Sunday.
But you should know the reality as I see it.
 I am, Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

   STATEMENT TO THE PRESSlibtech_370_footnote  
 
 March 18, 1939
 These two temples have been constructed at the instance  of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and are the result of the munificence of the House of Birlas, principally of Shri Jugal Kishore Birla who is parti-cularly inclined in this direction. It would have been in  the  fitness of things if the temples had been opened by Malaviyaji who inspired their construction. But as he is not here, it has fallen to my lot to perform the ceremony.
It is my hope that both these temples will make a special
 
 contribution to promote the religious sense of the worshippers. The temple of Buddha admits of no untouchability. But even in the temple of Krishna untouchability and the idea of high and low are taboo. For me, untouchability and the idea of high and low have no room in Hinduism. There are the varnas, but none of the varnas is superior to the other.Varna does not connote superiority ; it connotes different functions and different duties.
 Whoever has more of the earthly or spiritual goods has  to perform more service to the community, has to be more humble. The moment untouchability and the sense of high and low crept in, Hinduism began to decline. Hinduism is based on the firm foundation of truth and non-violence and, therefore, there is no room in it for conflict with other religions.
 It must be the daily prayer of every adherent of the Hindu faith that every known religion of the world should grow from day to day and should serve the whole of humanity. I hope that these temples will serve to propagate the idea of equal respect for religions and to make communal jealousies and strife things of the past.

   REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS  
 The four days’ fast set me thinking of the qualifications  required in a satyagrahi. Though they were carefully considered and reduced to writing in 1921libtech_371_footnotelibtech_372_footnotethey seem to have been  forgotten.  As satyagraha in the form of civil disobedience is being offered or contemplated in several States, it is necessary to reiterate the qualifications and to dispel false ideas that seem to be prevalent
 
 among many workers.
 Moreover the greatest care is necessary at the present moment when violence, not non-violence, seems to pervade the air. Indeed it may be reasonably argued that in an atmosphere surcharged with violence there is no scope for non-violence. This argument may be carried too far, so far that non-violence may be made wholly ineffec- tive; whereas it is claimed to be the only effective force for counterac- ting violence no matter how terrible. But when violence pervades the air the expression of non-violence may not be through civil disobe- dience. And if it is to be civil disobedience, it must be hedged in by adequate restrictions. In satyagraha, It is never the numbers that count; it is always the quality, more so when the forces of violence are uppermost.
 Then it is often forgotten that it is never the intention of a satyagrahi to embarrass the wrongdoer. The appeal is never to his fear; it is, must be, always to his heart. The satyagrahi’s object is not to convert, not to coerce, the wrongdoers. He should avoid artificiality in all his doings. He acts naturally and from inward convictions.
 Keeping these observations before his mind’s eye, the reader will perhaps appreciate the following qualifications which I hold are essential for every satyagrahi in India :
 He must have a living faith in God, for He is his only Rock.  He 	must believe 	in truth 	and non-violence 	as his 	creed and 	therefore have 	faith in the 	inherent goodness of 	human nature which 	he expects to 	evoke by his 	truth and 	love expressed 	through his 	suffering.  He 	must be 	leading a 	chaste life and 	be ready 	and willing 	for the sake of his cause to give up his life and his possessions.  He 	must be 	a habitual 	khadi-wearer and 	spinner. This 	is essential for India.  He 	must be 	a teetotaller 	and be 	free from the use of 	other intoxicants 	in order 	that his reason may 	be always 	unclouded and his 	mind constant.  He 	must carry out 	with a willing heart 	all the rules of 	discipline as 	may be laid down from 	time to 	time.  He 	should carry out 	the jail rules unless 	they are specially 	devised to 	hurt his self-respect. 
 The qualifications are not to be regarded as exhaustive. They are illustrative only.

N. 7974      DISCUSSION WITH TRAVANCORE SATYAGRAHISlibtech_379_footnote    March 	 20, 1939  	Suspension should never bring despondency and weakness in a 	satyagraha struggle. Even  though  people  may  be   ready  and  	non-    
 violence ensured, and suspension is ordered through a miscalculation of the general, it cannot jeopardize the future of the movement. Satyagraha means readiness to suffer and a faith that  the  more innocent and pure the suffering the more potent will it be in its effect. Helplessness is thus ruled out in satyagraha. Suspension of civil disobedience, if it resulted in an accentuation of repression, would itself become satyagraha in its ideal form.
 Today the opponent is afraid of your numbers. You cannot expect him to show a change of heart while he is filled with panic. He senses in your action a spirit of retaliation which irritates him the more. It thus becomes a species of violence.
 Your struggle hereafter may have to be restricted to a few men only, but their satyagraha will tell. While we are playing with non- violence we are only giving a chance to the powers that be in Travancore to organize the brute in man. This must not be.libtech_380_footnote

    STATEMENT  TO THE PRESSlibtech_381_footnote        NEW 	DELHI, 
  March 	20, 1939  	I observe that Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyarlibtech_382_footnotelibtech_383_footnotehad 	 no better use for the two 	Travancore stalwarts, Shri Thanu Pillai and Shri Rama- chandran, 	than to send them to prison. They will give a good account of 	themselves in prison as they have done outside. But I cannot 	congratulate the Travancore Durbar on their action.  	When I was in Rajkot I had seen Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar’s 	statement in condemnation of what he was pleased to term outside 	interference. May the Princes summon whatever outside assistance 	they may choose, and not the people? There is no restriction on the 	outside help the Princes may take. The popular party has put many 	voluntary restrictions on such help. After all, what am I doing 	except to give advice as an expert in the science of satyagraha? By 	doing so I promote the spirit of non-violence and the cause of 	peace. The connection between the people of the States and of the 	so-called      
 British India is organic, vital and indissoluble. There is no such connection between the Princes who are and who pride themselves on being independent of one another. The common tie between them is that of subservience to the Paramount Power, without  whose permission, implied or explicit, they cannot move a blade of grass.
 But the Paramount Power itself growingly lives on the will of the nation, including the people of the State. If the nation realizes that it can develop invincible strength through truth and non-violence, the Paramount Power will be voluntarily replaced by the power of the people. It, therefore, seems to me that Sir C. P. Ramaswami and those Dewans who think like him are bad advisers of their Princes and ill serve them. The effort to ignore the Congress and Congress workers and to prevent its natural influence working in the States is like that of a child who by the little palm of his right hand tries to stop an onrushing flood. This attempt to stifle the legitimate aspirations of the people of the States surely sows seeds of bitterness on the one hand between the people of the States and their Princes to whom they want to be loyal, and on the other between the Princes and the Congress which wants to help them if it is allowed to do so.
 I ask the Princes and their advisers to read the signs of the times and march with them. They may succeed by frightful measures in sending for a time the freedom movement underground, but they will never be able to crush it altogether. I venture to think also that the Paramount Power will have to shed their nervousness and overcau- tiousness. If they owe a duty to the Princes, surely they owe a duty to their people. The days when the people could be ignored are gone.
 If the Princes will not listen, let the Paramount Power tell them in plain terms that they may not expect the latter’s assistance in suppressing their people. The Paramount Power who draw Ministers in many Provinces from the Congress may not sit still when neighbour- ing states heap insults upon the Congress. It is an anomaly that demands quick handling.
 To the people of Travancore I suggest that the cause has benefited by the premature arrests of the two stalwarts. The benefit can only accrue if they will use the arrests wisely. If there is the slightest risk of violence breaking out, let there be no demonstration by way of processions and the like. Let them all devote themselves to constructive work. The date of launching out upon civil disobedience must not be anticipated. If I am to continue to advise, let me study the
 situation  and  let  them  await  my   opinionlibtech_384_footnotebefore   resuming   civil disobedience. Civil disobedience is but a minor part of satyagraha. Let the people, including the most illiterate and the downtrodden, be knit in a common bond by silent service. In this work even the students can take their due share. Let the satyagrahis remember that haste is waste. Their freedom was assured when they took the solemn vow of fighting for it through truth and non-violence, that is, through enlightened and disciplined self-suffering. For I know that they will never go back upon their vow.

   DICUSSION WITH JAIPUR SATYAGRAHIS libtech_385_footnote  
 March 20, 1939
 Provoking lathi charges or receiving lathi blows on your body in a spirit of bravado is not satyagraha. True satyagraha consists in the readiness to face blows if they come in the course of performing one’s duty.
 Today the whole atmosphere in the country is reeking of  violence as was evidenced at Tripuri. Under violence I include corruption, falsehood, hypocrisy, deceit and the like. If our satyagraha is to survive this atmosphere, we ahimsaites shall have to be more strict with ourselves. Let only the purest and the most innocent go to jail. It does not matter if they have to remain immured behind the prison bars for a whole lifetime. Their sacrifice will fill the prison with a sweet fragrance and its influence will even travel outside and subtly transform the entire atmosphere. They will never long for their release nor doubt that their sacrifice is being ‘wasted’. They will realize that a consecrated resolve is more potent in its action than mere physical action can ever be. The discipline that they will be acquiring in prison will help the non-violent organization of the people outside and instil fearlessness among them.
 So much for those who are in prison, what about those outside? They must engage in constructive work as the embodiment of the active principle of ahimsa. If it does not appeal to them, it will only
 
 betray their lack of faith in ahimsa.
 The other thing is internal. They must cultivate a living faith in God—an attitude of utter reliance on Him to the exclusion of all external aids. A single satyagrahi imbued with such faith will inspire the whole people by his example and may induce a heart change even in the opponent who, freed from fear, will the more readily appreciate his simple faith and respect it.libtech_386_footnote

   INTERVIEW TO  “THE NEW YORK TIMES”libtech_387_footnote  
 NEW DELHI,
 [Before March  23, 1939]libtech_388_footnote
 Asked what advice he would give the Congress regarding his attitude, should the Paramount Power become involved in a European war, Mahatma Gandhi pleaded that that was too difficult to answer at that time.
 He demurred also to a question whether he wished India to take her independence within the British Commonwealth of Nations or outside it. Gandhiji said :
That again is difficult. I cannot exactly tell where I myself stand
on that. Both are difficult questions.
 CORRESPONDENT : But don’t they go to the root of the situation?
 GANDHIJI : Wise journalists never go to the root.
 When asked if he was content with the result of the Tripuri Congress, the Mahatma was still smilingly evasive:
Contentment is bliss. That is one of your proverbs, isn’t it?
 C.	Then let me ask : Is India making progress to your liking?
 G.	(Thoughtfully) Yes, it is. I get frightened sometimes; but there is progress at the bottom and that progress is sound.
 The greatest difficulty is Hindu-Muslim differences. That is a serious obstacle. There I cannot say I see visible progress, but the
 
 trouble is bound to solve itself. The mass mind is sound if only because it is unselfish. The political grievances of both the commu- nities are identical, so are the economic grievances.
 During further conversation, the correspondent asked Mahatma Gandhi if in the present unrest he had got some message which he might carry across the world, moving men’s hearts towards peace. His eyes gleamed at the word “peace” and he bent his head in thought.
 G. I don’t see at the moment an atmosphere which would carry my voice to all nations. Perhaps I am far in advance of the times.
 C.	Might not it be said with equal truth that the times are falling behind you?
 G. If you like. I am thinking over your suggestion. Should I again allow myself to become the laughing-stock, as has some-times been the case? Should I? But why not? Laughter is wholesome. Perhaps it may be a good thing. So take this as coming from me :
 I see from today’s papers that the British Prime Minister is conferring with Democratic Powers as to how they should meet the latest threatening developments. How I wish he was conferring by proposing to them that all should resort to simultaneous disarmament.  I am as certain of it as I am sitting here, that this heroic act would open Herr Hitler’s eyes and disarm him.
 C.	Would not that be a miracle?
 G. Perhaps; but it would save the world from the butchery that seems to be impending. Isn’t that enough for one morning?

   STATEMENT SUSPENDING TRAVANCORE SATYAGRAHA libtech_392_footnote  
 NEW DELHI,
 March 23, 1939 I have had long Chatslibtech_393_footnotelibtech_394_footnotewith Shri Philipose about the situation in Travancore. I  have also carefully studied the resolution  of  the   last
Working committee of the State Congress and the well-thought-out
 elaborate plan of action to be taken all over Travancore together with great precautions embodied in it to ensure non-violence. I have also read the telegram received by Shri Philipose wherein he is told that if civil disobedience is further suspended, there will be much heart- burning and disappointment.
 But after having weighed the pros and cons I have come to the conclusion that it will be in the interest of the cause not to start civil disobedience on March 25 and to suspend it till I advise resumption.
 In satyagraha there is no such thing as disappointment or heart- burning. The struggle always goes on in some shape or other till the goal is reached. A satyagrahi is indifferent whether it is civil disobedience or some other phase of the struggle to which  he  is called. Nor does he mind if, in the middle of the civil disobedience march, he is called upon to halt and do something else. He must have faith that it is all for the best. My own experience hitherto has been that each suspension has found the people better equipped for the fight and for control over forces of violence. Therefore in advising suspension, I dismiss from my mind the fear that it may lead to desertion and disbelief. If it does, I should not feel sorry, for it would be to me a sign that the deserters did not know what satyagraha was and the movement was better without those who did not know what they were doing.
 The reasons that have prompted me to tender this advice are these: If it is true that the Travancore Durbar have drafted untrained raw men as police in order to strike terror among satyagrahis, it
 
 behoves the satyagrahis not to tempt the Durbar whilst suspension is a possibility. In view of the inhumanities which I believe have been perpetrated in various States, I am myself thinking out a new orientation of civil disobedience. I may fail. But if I am to succeed at all, I must have the quiet which can be produced only by suspension of civil disobedience wherever I am guiding it.
 This suspension gives one a chance of mobilizing public opinion in favour of the movement for liberty in Travancore. It gives also an opportunity to the Travancore Durbar to reconsider their view of satyagrahis and their demands.
 The Princes are themselves agitated over the tremendous awake- ning that has taken place among the people in the States. Suspension in Travancore and elsewhere gives them breathing time and an opportunity of thinking out their course of action free from  the  burden of dealing with civil resistance.
 Lastly, it is wise to allow the recent Viceregal message to the Princes to work itself among them.
 The satyagrahis of Travancore should know too that I have advisedlibtech_395_footnotesuspension of civil disobedience in Jaipur for similar reasons and I am likewise holding the hands of workers in other States. But I give my assurance to Travancoreans and all concerned that I shall not sit idle during suspension, nor shall I be long in coming to a final decision, assuming that in the mean while no relief has come in the States in which civil disobedience was going on and is under suspension.

 MY DEAR SUBHAS,
 I Do hope this will find you steadily progressing towards complete recovery.
 I enclose herewith copy of Sarat’s letter to me and my reply. If it represents also your sentiments, then and then only my suggestions
 
 are applicable. Anyway, the anarchy at the Centre should end. In accordance with your request, I am keeping absolutely silent, though pressure is being put upon me to give my opinion on the crisis.
 I saw the resolutionlibtech_396_footnotelibtech_397_footnotefor the  first time in Allahabad. It seems to me to be quite clear. The initiative lies with you. I do not know how far you are fit to attend to national work. If you are not, I think you should adopt the only constitutional course open to you.libtech_398_footnote

    From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal        BOMBAY THE BEAUTIFUL    	‘Handsome is that handsome does’ is a neat proverb. I have often 	said that it is wrong to call Bombay beautiful only because of        
 the fine approach to the harbour or for its many beauty spots so long as it contains dirty chawls, overcrowded lanes and uninhabitable hovels, which serve as dwelling places for its Harijans. But when Bombay goes dry,libtech_405_footnotelibtech_406_footnoteas it will very soon, it will become truly beautiful even for this one singularly beautiful act and it will deserve the title in spite of the blemishes I have mentioned. For when its labouring population has the temptation of drink removed from them, with the improvement in their condition which always follows the exorcism of the drink devil, it must become easier for the Bombay Municipality to deal with the problem of providing better habitations for the poor classes. The Bombay Govern-ment, and especially Dr. Gilder, deserve the thanks of the citizens of Bombay, nay of the whole Province, for the courage with which they have approached their task. I know that many Parsis who depend upon drink traffic for their living will be affected. Bombay is the stronghold of the Parsis. Then there are its fashionable citizens who think they need their spirituous drinks as they need water. I have every hope that they will all rise to the occasion, think of their poor brethren, even if they do not appreciate abstinence for themselves, and set an example to all India and make good the claim of Bombay not only to be beautiful but also the first city in India.
 Prohibition in Bombay will mean a big fall in revenue. The Finance Minister has to balance his budget. He has to find money. He has to levy new taxes. Let there be no complaint from those who will have to bear the burden. Dislike of taxes, be they ever so reasonable, is proverbial. I understand that the Finance Minister has met all just objections. Why should those who will have to bear the burden not feel a pride in being given the privilege of contributing to the great experi-ment? It will be a proud day for Bombay if prohibition is ushered in amid the rejoicings of the whole population. Let it be remembered that this prohibition is not a superimposition. It is being introduced by Govern-ments that are responsible to the people. It has been a plank in the national programme since 1920. It is coming, therefore, in due fulfilment of the national will definitely expressed nearly twenty years ago.

   		‘SUSPENSION SHOULD CONTINUE’  
 Shri Philipose has received the following telegram from Trivandrum :
 Arrests continue. Kunjukrishna Pillai and others arrested.Kuzhitharai Krishna Pillai, President, arrested today (24th).Korah nominated President. Inform Gandhiji.
I had not expected that arrests would continue even after the
 suspension of civil disobedience. But of course my expectations need not be fulfilled. Suspension was advised for reasons publicly stated by me. If Travancore authorities consider it necessary to continue arrests, satya grahis may not complain. Civil disobedience gives cause for arrest or makes some action by the authorities necessary. Therefore, as a rule, suspension without any previous understanding with the State is generally followed not only by discontinuance of arrests but even by discharge of those convicted for disobedience. If the Trivandrum wire is correct, authorities in Travancore have adopted an unexpected course. Their action need not perturb or perplex satyagrahis. Suspension should still continue. I have no doubt that such arrests will help the popular cause more than if civil disobedience was continued, assuming, of course, that there was no cause for arrest other than that the arrested persons were satyagrahis. Since suspension has been declared I hold it to be unnecessary to appoint a President instead of the one arrested. The object of appointing successive Presidents in place of those arrested no longer subsists. There must be a provision in the ordinary constitution of the State Congress for conduct of business in the absence of the President.
 I am painfully conscious of the fact that satyagrahis were unprepared for the exigency created by my advice. Let them console themselves, if they can, by the fact that though they may not just now appreciate or understand what may to them appear to be new technique, it has been advised by one who claims to know the science of satyagraha. It calls for infinite patience and boundless faith in its efficacy. Everything comes right for those who watch, wait and pray.
 Since writing the foregoing I have seen the official reaction to suspension. An Associated Press message says that official opinion seems to be that civil disobedience is neither given up nor even suspended. If there was any ground  for suspicion, it should be dispelled by the State Congress second President, Shri N. Srikrishna
 Pillai, who, according to another Associated Press message, says :
 Civil disobedience has been suspended at the instance of Mahatmaji,libtech_407_footnoteand  it will be resumed only with his sanction, whatever time it may take. My instruction to the country is that the State Congress workers should preach the technique of non-violence (as different from non-violent direct action) to the masses as well as the message of khadi and swadeshi. The State Congress, as it stands at present, does not contemplate any direct action without  command from Mahatmaji. I know that picketing of liquor shops is not breaking of any law and it is not prohibited by Government. Yet, fearing trouble and misunderstanding, we are not launching even that.
 This emphatic statement puts the matter beyond any suspicion. I am hoping that civil resisters who were eagerly looking forward to the resumption of civil disobedience will conform to the letter and the spirit of the presidential instructions and thus show that if they understood what ‘disobedience’ was they understood equally well what ‘civil’ meant.
 I am convinced that much of our trouble has arisen from our not putting due emphasis in our actions on the implications of the word ‘civil’ which is the very opposite of criminal, uncivil and violent. Let the suspension enable the members of the State Congress and the Travancore public in general to realize the tremendous implications of non-violence, and I promise that its practice in thought, word and deed will hasten the progress towards their goal as nothing else will.
 NEW DELHI, March 26, 1939

   JAIPUR CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE  
 The cry comes from Jaipur that some civil resisters are disappointed over the suspension and are not as enthusiastic to tackle the constructive programme, which is chiefly the spinning-wheel and khadi, as they were for fight. If this is the general feeling, the suspen- sion is doubly justified. For the reluctance betrays lack of appre- ciation of ahimsa without which resistance becomes a species of vio- lence. Those who lightly talk of freedom in the States and hope to attain it through civil resistance, evidently do not know what they are talking about. Will thay not learn the lesson of the Provinces?
 
 
 Provincial Autonomylibtech_408_footnotelibtech_409_footnotesuch as it is, has been won by civil resistance however inferior it may have been. But do they not realize that it is likely to break down if Congress Ministers cannot carry on without the aid of the Police and the Military, i.e., without British guns? If the partial autonomy was won by non-violent means, it must be held also by such means and no other. From recent experiences it seems clear that the country is not ready to hold power through non-violent means. Though for the past twenty years—the period of the greatest mass awakening—the people have been taught to abjure the use of arms including brick-bats and the lathi, and to rely upon non-violence pure and simple, we know that Congress Ministers have been obliged to resort to violence to suppress popular violence real or imaginary. It is clear also that the country cannot be made ready for the use of violence without training. Was our non-violence that of the weak? Hindu-Muslim tension is to me the acid test. The Congress corruption is a sure sign of violence. Swaraj within the States is not to be obtained by any non-violent trick. It will be won, if it is to be won, by non- violence of the strong, i. e., by hard work, patient and mute suffering, service of the poor, the hungry and the forsaken of society, and a voluntry obedience to the laws of the State and society in so far as they are not repugnant to public and private morals. Unless non- violence of the strong is really developed among us, there should be no thought of civil disobedience for swaraj, whether within the States or in British India. And as an indispensable test—by no means infallible—of non-violence I adhere to habitual spinning and habitual use of khadi by the would-be civil resister. The Jaipur satyagrahis, if they desire to take part in any civil disobedience struggle that may take place in future, should understand the implications of non- violence and apply themselves with zest to the fulfilment of the minimum conditions I have prescribed. Let them also know that what applies to them applies to all future satyagrahis that I may have to deal with.
 This, however, does not mean that the fight for swaraj stops. It only means that civil disobedience is not to be so cheap as I fear I have, indirectly if not directly, made it. But I am never too old to learn. One is ever young in the felt presence of the God of Truth or Truth which is God. But if civil disobedience is henceforth to be a very dear commodity, I hope, God willing, to show that it will prove to
 
 be infinitely more effective and faster moving than the alloy with which we have so far contented ourselves.

  March 	 27, 1939 I 	had kept my reply readylibtech_410_footnotelibtech_411_footnote. In the mean time, I got your letter.       In 	“The Rajkot Fast—VIII”, 	Pyarelal reports the following under March 26: “Although Sardar 	had sent in his submission as required by the Chief Justice on the 	17th instant, further proceedings had been held up because no 	statement had been received on behalf of the Rajkot Durbar. This 	delay was irksome to a degree but it could not be helped. Durbar 	Virawala at last arrived yesterday to represent the Rajkot Durbar 	before the Chief Justice. He submitted a statement covering forty 	typed foolscap sheets. A copy of it was sent to the Sardar for 	reply. The Durbar’s statement was full of vituperation against the 	Sardar. It questioned the validity of the Thakore Saheb’s letter 	to the Sardar of December 26th which it alleged had been obtained by 	the Sardar from the Thakore Saheb ‘under duress’ and by 	‘fraudulent means’. The Sardar’s reply to it was brief, barely 	covering half a sheet. The bulk of the Rajkot Durbar’s submission, 	he pleaded, consisted of irrelevant and libellous statements, 	unsupported by evidence. These he requested should be ordered to be 	expunged. As for the Thakore Saheb’s letter of even date with the 	notification No. 50 of December 
 Even then, it does not warrant any change. Let me add that I repudiatelibtech_412_footnotelibtech_413_footnotethe story regarding fraudlibtech_414_footnotelibtech_415_footnote. in fact, the question does not arise at all.

   DISCUSSION WITH AGATHA HARRISON libtech_417_footnote  
 
 March   29/30, 1939
 The thinglibtech_418_footnotelibtech_419_footnoteis incredibly simple. But the simplest things have the knack sometimes of appearing to us as the hardest. If our hearts were opened, we should have no difficulty. Non-violence is a matter of the heart. It does not come to us through any intellectual feat. Everyone has faith in God though everyone does not know it.  For, everyone has
 
 26th, it was self-explained and admitted of only one meaning, and extraneous evidence was inadmissible for its interpretation. He therefore prayed that the Chief Justice give his interpretation of the said Note of 26th December last without permitting any further procrastination. The hearing took place at half past three in the afternoon at the Chief Justice’s residence. At the request of the Chief Justice the Sardar gave a brief narrative of the events from the time he came into the picture till the signing of the Thakore Saheb’s note to him of December 26th. The judgment was reserved for another date” (Harijan, 3-6-1939)
 faith in himself and that multiplied to the nth degree is God. The sum total of all that lives is God. We may not be God but we are of God— even as a little drop of water is of the ocean. Imagine it torn away from the ocean and flung millions of miles away. It becomes helpless torn from its surroundings and cannot feel the might and majesty of the ocean but if someone could point out to it that it is of the ocean, its faith would revive, it would dance with joy and the whole of the might and majesty of the ocean would be reflected in it. Even so it is with all non-violent activities. Take spinning for half an hour daily. It is nothing unless it is tacked on to non-violence. Take the counting of beads. A monkey also can count them but devotees count them to get nearer to God. I want everybody to spin as a token of his faith in non- violence, as a token of his identification with the dumb millions. Then alone shall we feel the upwelling of non-violent strength  in us.libtech_420_footnote
The non-violence that we have offered hitherto has not been the
 non-violence of the brave. As a weapon of the weak, as an expedient, it was good enough. It did answer its purpose for a while. But how long can the non-violence of the weak last? I have not been able to answer for Europe because I have not worked it out in India. And yet  I would not rewrite those chapters in our history. God fulfils Himself even through the weakness of His instruments sometimes. But if we now do not overhaul the basis of our non-violence and if we continue to drift in the old style, It would be nothing short of a catastrophe. We shall not have evolved the non-violent strength and courage,  and,  faced with a crisis, might behave like cowards.

   LETTER TO SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSE  
 NEW DELHI,
 March   30, 1939
 MY DEAR SUBHAS,
 I have delayed my reply to your letter of 25thlibtech_423_footnoteinstant for the sake of having your reply to my wirelibtech_424_footnote. I got Sunil’s wire last night. I have now got up before morning prayer time to write this reply.
 Since you think that Pandit Pant’s resolutionlibtech_425_footnotewas out of order and the clause relating to the Working Committee is clearly uncons- titutional and ultra vires, your course is absolutely clear. Your choice of the Committee should be unfettered.
 Your several questions on this head, therefore, do not need any answering.
 Since we met in February, my opinion has becomes streng- thened that where there are differences on fundamentals, as we agreed there were, a composite committee would be harmful. Assuming, therefore, that your policy had the backing of the majority of the A. I.
C. C., you should have a Working Committee composed purely of those who believe in your policy.
 Yes, I adhere to the view expressed by me at Segaon at our February meeting that I would not be guilty of being party to any self-suppression by you, as distinguished from voluntary self-efface- ment. Any subordination of a view which you may strongly hold as in the best interests of the country would be self-suppression. Therefore, if you are to function as President, your hands must be unfettered. The situation before the country admits of no middle course.
 
 So far as the Gandhi-ites (to use that wrong expression) are concerned, they will not obstruct you. They will help you where they can, they will abstain where they cannot. There should be no difficulty whatsoever, if they are in a minority. They may not suppress them- selves if they are clearly in a majority.
 What worries me, however, is the fact that the Congress electorate is bogus and that, therefore, majority and minority lose their full meaning. Nevertheless, till the Congress stable is cleansed, we have to manage with the instrument we have for the time being. The other thing worrying me is the terrible distrust among ourselves. Joint work is an impossibility where the workers distrust one another.
 I think there is no other point in your  letter that  needs answering.
 In all you do, may you be guided by God. Do be well quickly by obeying the doctors.
 Love."

    DEAR 	SIR AKBARlibtech_426_footnote, I 	am grateful to you for your kind letter.  March 	30, 1939 
  	Dr. Moonje’s letter is striking. You may depend upon my not 	rushing to print without first reference to you on matters relating 	to Hyderabad. I expect great things from you. I cannot forget our 	talks on our return journey from London. We were to have embarked on 	a joint mission of peace between the two communities, but God had 	willed otherwise. I was to go to prison instead. But though 	seemingly we could not work together, the wish has persisted with 	me, as I am sure it has with you. You have opportunities, which I 	have not, to fulfil that wish. I am watching you with a friend’s 	interest. I am looking    
 forward to the reforms adumbrated in your letter.
 Every day I look for the news that you have discharged the State Congress Prisoners. You Know that I have prevented resumption of satyagraha by that body. Unless you have definite information to the contrary, I would like you to believe me when I tell you that if you treated them with sympathy, they will help and not hinder you in your effort to open a new era in Hyderabad.
 I thank you for your reference to my fast. I hope you are well.

 QUESTION : What would you do in Allahabad, if you were there?
 ANSWER : I would scrap the existing Congress machinery. It is a burden today. If there were half a dozen genuine Congressmen only on the Congress register today, they would be real messengers of peace. But today their effort is smothered under the weight of  numbers. If all Congressmen whose names are on the  Congress  register today were worth their salt, they would offer themselves to be cut to pieces before the communal trouble proceeds any further. But today each wants to use the dagger against his fellow. We have either to revise everything in terms of non-violence or give up non-violence and rebuild the organization.

And if this is honestly done, I do not see why there should be any bitterness, ending in civil war.
 What is wrong is not the differences between us but loss of mutual respect and trust. This will be remedied by time, which is the best healer. If there is real non-violence in us, there can be no civil war, much less bitterness.
 Taking all things into consideration, I am of opinion that you should at once form your own Cabinet fully representing your views, formulate your programme definitely and put it before the forthcoming A. I. C. C. If the Committee accepts the programme, all will be plain-sailing and you should be enabled to prosecute it unhampered by the minority. If, on the other hand, your progamme is not accepted you should resign and let the Committee choose its President. And you will be free to educate the country along your own lines. I tender this advice irrespective of Pandit Pant’s resolution.
 Now for your question. When Pandit Pant’s resolutionlibtech_441_footnotewas pro- duced, I was on my bed. Mathuradas, who happened to be in Rajkot that day, one morning brought me the message that there was to be a resolution expressing confidence in the old horses. I had not the text before me. I said it would be good so far as it went, for I had been told at Segaon that your election was not so much confidence in you as censure of the old horses, especially the Sardar. After this, I saw the actual text only in Allahabad when I went to see the Maulana Saheb.
 My prestige does not count. It has no independent value of its own. When my motive is suspected or my policy or programme rejected by the country, the prestige must go. India will rise or fall by the quality of the sum total of the acts of her many millions. Individuals, however high they may be, are of no account except in so far as they represent the many millions. Therefore, let us rule it out of consideration.
 I wholly dissent from your view that the country has been never so non-violent as now. I smell violence in the air I breathe. But the violence has put on a subtle form. Our mutual distrust is a bad form of violence. The widening gulf between Hindus and Mussalmans
 
 points to the same thing. I can give further illustrations.
 We seem to differ as to the amount of corruption in the Congress. My impression is that it is on the increase. I have been pleading for the past many months for a thorough scrutiny.
 In these circumstances, I see no atmosphere  for  non-violent mass action. An ultimatum without an effective sanction is worse than useless.
 But, as I have told you, I am an old man, perhaps growing timid and over-cautious, and you have youth before you and reckless optimism born of youth. I hope you are right and I am wrong. I have the firm belief that the Congress, as it is today, cannot deliver the goods, cannot offer civil disobedience worth the name. Therefore, if your prognosis is right, I am a back number and played out as the generalissimo of satyagraha.
 I am glad you have mentioned the little Rajkot affair. It brings into prominent relief the different angles from which we look  at things. I have nothing to repent of in the steps I have taken in connection with it. I feel that it has great national importance. I have not stopped civil disobedience in the other States for the sake of Rajkot. But Rajkot opened my eyes; it showed me the way. I am not in Delhi for my health. I am reluctantly in Delhi, awaiting the Chief Justice’s decision. I hold it to be my duty to be in Delhi till the steps to be taken, in due fulfilment of the Viceroy’s declaration in his last wirelibtech_442_footnotelibtech_443_footnoteto me, were finally taken. I may not run any risk. If I invited the Paramount Power to do its duty, I was bound to be in Delhi to see that the duty was fully performed. I saw nothing wrong in the Chief Justice being appointed the interpreter of the document whose meaning was put in doubt by the Thakore Saheb. By the way, Sir Maurice examines the document not in his capacity as Chief Justice but as a trained jurist, trusted by the Viceroy. By accepting the Viceroy’s nominee a judge, I fancy I have shown both wisdom and grace and, what is more important, I have increased the Viceregal responsibility in the matter.
 Though we have discussed sharp differences of opinion between us, I am quite sure that our private relations will not suffer in the least.
 
 If they are from the heart, as I believe they are, they will bear the strain of these differences.
Love.

   THE STATES  
 A clear understanding of the suspension of civil disobedience in the States is necessary if the people are to reap the full benefit of it. One result—not unexpected—seems to have been that some States have stiffened their attitude and are resorting to repression they had not perhaps thought of before suspension. Where this happens there is no cause for losing heart. Repression itself affords a training in satyagraha, even as an unsought war affords a training for the soldier. Satyagrahis should discover the causes of repression. They will find that repressed people are easily frightened by the slightest show of force and are unprepared for suffering and self-sacrifice. This is then the time for learning the first lessons of satyagraha. Those who know anything of this matchless force should teach their neighbours to bear repression not weakly and helplessly but bravely  and  knowingly. Thus, for example, a State declares an  association  illegal.  The members may submit either because of fear of punishment or knowingly because they do not yet wish to offer civil disobedience. In the latter case, they husband their energy and develop the will to resist non-violently. Individual members of the association will still carry on activities that may not be regarded as in themselves illegal. They will also carry on constitutional agitation to secure legal recognition for their organization. And if in spite of voluntarily working within the four corners of the local laws workers are arrested or otherwise illtreated, they would cheerfully submit to the sufferings involved. So doing they will examine themselves whether they bear any ill will or anger towards their persecutors, they will ask themselves whether they feel the presence of God as their true Helper and Guide in their difficulties. Indeed such training if properly and persistently taken will generate in the learners a power of calm, non-violent resistance which in itself will become invincible and therefore  may  render further effort by way of civil disobedience wholly unnecessary.
I  am  afraid I  must plead guilty  to   being  over-confident and
 hasty in launching previous civil disobedience campaigns. No harm seems to have accrued to the country because I had always my hand on the pulse of the country and, thank God, had no hesitation in retracing the step taken if I scented danger or discovered an error of
 judgment or calculation. This much harm must, however be admitted. The people having become used to laxity about previous preparation now find it irksome to conform to the strictness in the observance of the unexciting rules of preparation. And yet they are much the most important part of satyagraha training. Potent and active non-violence cannot be cultivated unless the candidate goes through the necessary stages which require a lot of plodding. If, however, I have succeeded in showing the repression, if properly understood, evokes natural and spontaneous resistance in a satyagrahi, perhaps this knowledge will roblibtech_454_footnotethe constructive effort and the waiting of their seeming insipidity. Indeed the fact that these things appear insipid betrays want of appreciation of satyagraha and the beauty and efficacy of non- violence. In other words, the spirit of satyagraha has not sunk deep and violence still lurks even though unconsciously in the seeker’s breast.
 I hope, therefore that repression, wherever it is resorted to, will not depress the repressed people but will accelerate the pace of the constructive effort. It is necessary so far as it is possible to convince the powers that be of our absolutely non-violent intention. Such conviction is half the battle won. In order to carry this conviction home there must be sufficient curb on our speech and writing as our action must be non-violent beyond doubt.

 will be changed. But before that happens you will have to add to prohibition much constructive effort. You will require skilled medical assistance to enable you to find out a substitute for opium which will kill the craving and rebuild the shattered bodies of the opium-eaters. May you be blessed with all the strength and wisdom you would need.

N. 7216      STATEMENT TO THE PRESSlibtech_461_footnote      NEW DELHI  April 4, 1939 I have read 	long accounts of a great Parsi meeting in Bombay protesting against 	prohibition in Bombay. I note that Parsi ladies also took 	part in the meeting. I  have also some letters from Parsi  friends  	appealing to me, as the  author  of  prohibition  as a chief  plank  	in  the Congress programme, to ask the Bombay Ministry to desist 	from their policy of prohibition.  	It is not clear whether the objection is to prohibition as such or 	to the new taxation. All India knows the intimate connection that 	subsists between the Parsis and me. It hurts me to think that this 	race of the greatest philanthropists in the world should ally itself 	to a campaign against a cause whose basis is purest philanthropy. 	The hurt is all the greater for the knowledge that even Parsi ladies 	have allied themselves to the campaign. I see that unworthy threats 	were used at the meeting and the rights of minorities were pleaded. 	I can only hope that all the heat shown at the meeting was due to 	the momentary passion, and that the innate philanthropy of the 	Parsis will assert itself.  I venture to suggest that the Parsis 	will be among the first to benefit by the prohibition policy. It is 	wrong to suggest that drink has done or is doing no harm to the 	Parsis. The Parsis will be the gainers for the    
 diversion of Parsi liquor-sellers to some other means of livelihood.
 Let me remind the objectors that prohibition does not affect unfermented toddy which is called nira. Therefore no Parsi will be deprived of his nira which, I admit, is as healthy as sugarcane juice and perhaps cheaper if a means can be discovered of preventing quick fermentation which nira undergoes more than other sweet juices.
 The objectors departed from truth when they raised the cry of attack on religion. I have read the carefully drawn prohibition rules which provide for special permits for the use of spirituous liquors for bona-fide religious rites. The rules also provide for their use for medicinal purposes. And so far as taxation is concerned it ill behoves philanthropists to grumble at taxation for a cause so noble as prohibition which means the welfare of ignorant millions. I hope, therefore, that the nobler element, of which there is so much among the Parsis, will assert itself and help the glorious movement which promises to deliver the labouring population from a curse which is destroying them body and soul.

   STATEMENT TO THE PRESSlibtech_462_footnote  
 
 NEW DELHI,
 April 4, 1939 Shri Philipose, who is specially with me to keep me informed of events in Travancore, has received a revealing wire from the President
of the Travancore State Congress. It appears that though the leaders
 who were arrested and imprisoned in anticipation of the contemplated civil disobedience were released, arrests of others on some pretext or another continue. These are active, well-known workers. What is worse, special police, who are without uniforms and are untrained,  are reported to be acting like goondas. They break up meetings  by creating rowdyism, and beating drums. They molest parties of workers doing constructive work. Thus a party of 11 persons led by Shri Verghese, a well-known lawyer, was brutally assaulted in Quilon on March 31, and robbed of their cash. Several were seriously injured and are laid up.
 
 Assuming that the information furnished to me is correct, it is a serious reflection on the authorities. I can only hope that such repression will die out if only for want of retaliation on the part of the people. Let the workers realize that they have one fruit of civil resistance in spite of its suspension. They have the privilege of undeserved suffering. And, if they can undergo it without malice and anger, they will find themselves nearer their goal than hitherto. At least I have no reason for revising my opinionlibtech_463_footnotelibtech_464_footnoteas to the necessity of suspension. Indeed this thoughtless repression proves the wisdom of suspension.

   HAVE I ERRED?  
 Some friends have been expostulating with me for involving myself in the Rajkot affair. I sum up their argument below:
 In giving so much attention to Rajkot to the exclusion of all else you seem to have lost all sense of proportion. It was your obvious duty to be at Tripuri. If you had been there, things would have taken a different turn. But you chose to undertake an indefinite fast. You had no right thus to disturb national life without notice. Why should you fast to make a Prince keep his promise? The people of Rajkot were offering civil disobedience. They would have become stronger in any case if you had not suddenly stopped the movement. Surely, democracy cannot be built by your method. And then you, who taught India to shun Viceroys and Governors and such other functionaries who used to fill us with awe, are now found dancing attendance on the Viceroy and awaiting His Excellency’s pleasure when great affairs demand your attention elsewhere. You are believed to oppose Federation, but you recognize the Chief Justice of the Federal Court and will not leave Delhi till His Lordship has delivered his Award. Truly the ways of mahatmas are strange.
 To the hasty reader this argument must make a forcible appeal. But one who goes a little deeper into the subject and knows the working of satyagraha should have no difficulty in seeing the falsity of the argument. Nor is there anything new in what I have done and am doing about Rajkot. Geographically Rajkot is a tiny spot on the map of India, but the disturbance which I felt called upon to deal with was symptomatic of a universal malady. My endeavour in Rajkot was meant to nip the evil in the bud. I am of opinion that the result of the endeavour has so far benefited the whole of India. I acted the part of a wise general who never disregards the slightest weakness in his defences. Kheda and Champaran are but instances in point. Whilst they lasted they occupied the attention of the whole of India, and whilst the fight was going on I had to devote the whole of my time and attention to them. It is a rare occurrence to have to deal with the whole front at the same time. We must distinguish between preparat- ions for war and actual outbreak of a skirmish, be it ever so insigni- ficant in itself. Tripuri was a preparation, Rajkot was a Skirmish.
The fast is a most efficacious weapon in the armoury of non-
 violence. That it can be used only by the fewest possible persons is no objection to its use. It would be foolish for me not to use the talents given to me by God on the ground that others or all do not possess some of them. I have never heard it said that use of special talents placed at the service of democracy can retard its even growth. I hold that such use stimulates it as the Rajkot fast undoubtedly has. And why is the Rajkot fast to be condemned, if the nation benefited by the previous fasts? It is open to the critics to say that the previous ones were also criticized. So they were. But my point is that the nation gained by every one of them. What does arrest the growth of the democratic spirit is the outbreak of violence. I must ask the public to believe me when I say that if my fast did nothing else, it prevented much violence.
 I have no sense of shame about going to H. E. the Viceroy. I had invited him as the Crown Representative to perform his duty by intervening to enforce performance of a promise by a tributary of the Crown. I had not gone as a petitioner depending upon his mercy. It would have been churlish on my part to have sought his intervention and yet not to respond to his invitation to see him to discuss things. I have already acknowledged the handsome manner in which he acted during the fast. It was open to him to disregard it and take his time in deciding whether and when if at all he should intervene. But he did not do so. He recognized the nation’s anxiety. And I have no doubt that his humane instinct, too, had a share in cutting short his tour in Rajputana in order to determine his action with sufficient quickness. I have no apology to offer for my attendances on the Viceroy. It is part of satyagraha to lose no opportunity of converting one’s opponent or coming to terms with him on strictly honourable lines. I repeated on a small scale with Lord Linlithgow what I did with Lord Halifax when as Lord Irwin he was Viceroy of India.
 Lastly, as to my acceptance of the Chief Justice of India as the interpreter of the Thakore Saheb’s letter of 26th December last sent to Sardar Vallabhabhai Patel. The Thakore Saheb interpreted it one way, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel another way. The Viceroy suggested inter- pretation by the Chief Justice of India. What was I to do? Was I to say he must not because he was Chief Justice of a Court which was a creation of the Government of India Act? My sense of propriety  would rebel against any such objection. Federation has  come no nearer by my accepting Maurice Gwyer’s nomination as judge of the meaning of a document. If it comes as an imposition, it will come
 because of our impotence born of our inability to bring into non- violent subjection the forces of violence that are growing  in  the country and the increasing indiscipline and corruption  in  the Congress against which I have been raising my voice for the past twelve months.
 It may interest the reader to know that Sir Maurice did not interpret the document in his capacity as Cheif Justice of the Federal Court but as a jurist of established repute. He  who  reads  the judgement cannot fail to notice the pains he bestowed upon it.

 CHI. KAKA,
 I got your letter. I am on my way to Rajkot. Only God knows when it will all end. I have a fear that you yourself tore up the papers relating to the budget. Prepare it afresh and send it. It is only in May that we shall now be able to attend to the Gandhi Seva Sangh affairs. It will be excellent if the Hindi propagation work in Assam is properly organized. We should meet their request for free teachers. The money for that can be raised in Calcutta. Why not ask all the Provinces to give an account of the Hindi work done? I don’t think you will get any.
 
 How can they send any when there is no account to give?All the same you may try. Do you take proper care of your health?

 CHI. BRAJKISAN,
 Why such a long letter? I admit my mistake. My nature is responsible for it. Only those who demand insistently get anything from me. I have not the ability to judge everyone. Nevertheless, my confessing my error does not in any way reduce your own. Your lack of method is terrible though you are not at all careless. Your attachment, too, is equally terrible. That is why you have not finished any work. Let the brothers alone even now. Where do you have any money to give? Do not take even a pie from the family. Beg for Jugatramji. Take up a job and live on the salary. You will thus set an example for the brothers.
 Forget me, and surrendering yourself to God make an effort.

   WHAT TO DO?  
 Here  is  an  important  letterlibtech_492_footnotefrom  a  Principal  who  wishes  to remain anonymous:
 A troubled conscience seeks the reasoned opinion of others to help to solve the following pressing question: Is the carrying out of the pledge of the Peace Pledge Union (the late Dick Shepard’s organization for opposing war by the refusal to resort to violence under any circumstances whatever) a right and   a practicable course of action in the present conditions of our world ?
 On the side of ‘Yea’ there are the following arguments:
  The 	world’s greatest 	spiritual teachers have 	taught and 	exemplified in 	their own lives that an 	evil thing can only be 	destroyed by 	good means, 	and never 	by evil 	means, and 	any sort of 	violence . 	. . is undoubtedly 	an evil 	means, whatever may 	be the motive. . 	. .  The 	real causes of the present 	violence and 	misery can 	 never  be  removed by war. . . . . . . War . . .  even if it ends in victory, means.	destruction 	of such 
 liberties as remain to us. . . for no modern war can be waged	without the
 complete regimentation	It is better to die in conscientiously resisting
 oppression non-violently,  than  to  live as  a  pawn  in  the  regimented society . . .
 On the side of ‘Nay’ there are the following arguments:
  Non-violent 	resistance can only 	be effective 	in resisting 	people who 	are capable 	of being 	moved by moral and  	humanitarian  	consideratons. Fascism . . . has no scruple . . . in employing any degree of brutality . . .  To 	refuse co-operation in 	violent resistance. 	. . in defence of 	democratic liberty, is 	tantamount to 	helping those who 	are destroying that 	liberty. Fascist 	aggression has 	undoubtedly been encouraged by the knowledge that the 	democracies contain 	numbers of people 	who are unwilling 	to fight 	in their 	defence, and who would 	even oppose (and thus obstruct) their 	own Governments 	This being 	so, the conscientious 	objector to violent 
 means of defence becomes not merely ineffective in promoting peace, but actually helpful to those who are breaking it.
  War 	may destroy liberty, but 	if the 	democracies survive there 	is at least 	some possibility 	of regaining 	part of 	it, whereas 	if the 	Fascists are 	allowed to 	rule the world, there is no chance at all. . . . 
 
 The solution of this question is obviously terribly pressing ... But is it not really just as pressing for those in other countries, say South Africa, Egypt, or Australia which may have to face the possibility of invasion, or in an India which in the event of ‘complete independence’ might be faced with the possibility of invasion by Japan or by a pan-Islamic combination?
 In the face of such possibilities (say rather probabilities), ought not even every keen conscience (whether in a young body or in an old) to be certain exactly what is the right and practical way of action?...
Nothing need be said about the arguments in favour of the
 Peace Pledger’s resistance. Those against resistance deserve careful examination. The first argument, if it is valid, cuts at the very root of the anti-war movement. It is based on the assumption that it is possible to convert Fascists and Nazis. They belong to the same species as the so-called democracies or, better still, war-resisters themselves. They show in their family circles the same tenderness,  affection, consideration and generosity that war-resisters are likely to show even outside such circles. The difference is only of degree. Indeed Fascists and Nazis are a revised edition of so-called democracies if they are not an answer to the latters’ misdeeds. Kirby Page in his brochure on the toll of the late war has shown that both the combatants were guilty of falsehoods, exaggerations and inhumanities. The Versailles Treaty was a treaty of revenge against Germany by the victors. The so-called democracies have before now misappropriated other people’s lands and have resorted to ruthless repression. What wonder if Messrs Hitler and company have reduced to a science the unscientific violence their predecessors had developed for exploiting the so-called backward races for their own material gain? It is therefore a matter of rule of three to find out the exact amount of non-violence required to melt the harder hearts of the Fascists and the Nazis, if it is assume, as it is, that the so-called democracies melt before a given amount of non- violence. Therefore, we must eliminate from consi-deration the first and the fatal argument if it could be proved to have any content in it.
 The other two arguments are practical. The pacifists may not do anything to weaken their own Governments so as to compel defeat. But for fear of so doing they may not miss the only effective chance they have of demonstrating their undying faith in the futility of all war. If their own Governments go mad and make martyrs of war- resisters, they (the Governments) must, suffer the consequence of the unrest of their own creation. The democracies must respect the liberty
 of individual non-violent conscience however it may be. From that respect there will spring hope for the world. This means that they put their conscience and truth before their country’s so-called interest. For regard for one’s conscience, if it is really such, has never yet injured any legitimate cause or interest. Therefore, it comes to this that a pacifist must resist when he feels strongly that, whether so-called democracies live or die, the tug of war will never end war and that it will only end when at the crucial moment a body of pacifists have at any cost testified their living faith by suffering, if need be, the extreme penalty. I know the point for me to consider is not how to avoid the extreme penalty but how to behave so as to achieve the object in view. Where the very disturbing but potent factor of faith is part of one’s conduct, human calculations are of no avail. A true pacifist is a true satyagrahi. The latter acts by faith and therefore is not concerned about the result, for he knows that it is assured when the action is true.
 After all, what is the gain if the so-called democracies win? War certainly will not end. Democracies will have adopted all the tactics of the Fascists and the Nazis including conscription and all other forcible methods to compel and exact obedience. All that may be gained at the end of the victory is the possiblity of comparative protection of individual liberty. But that protection does not depend upon outside help. it comes from the internal determination to protect it against the whole world. In other words, the true democrat is he who with purely non-violent means defends his liberty and therefore his country’s and ultimately that of the whole of mankind. In the coming test pacifists have to prove their faith by resolutely refusing to do anything with war whether of defence or offence. But the duty of resistance accrues only to those who believe in non-violence as a creed—not to those who will calculate and will examine the merits of each case and decide whether to approve of or oppose a particular war. It follows that such resistance is a matter for each person to decide for himself and under the guidance of the inner voice, if he recognizes its existence.

I suggested a meeting of the foes to have it out among themselves 	without any reservation. But so much has happened since that I do 	not know if it is worth while. They will only swear at one another 	and bitterness will become more bitter. The gulf is too wide, 	suspicions too deep. I see no way of closing the ranks. The only way 	seems to me to recognize the differences and let each group work in 	its own manner. I 	feel myself utterly incompetent to bring the warring elements        
 together for joint work. I should hope that they can work out their policies with becoming dignity. If they do so it will be well with the country.
 Pandit Pant’s resolution I cannot interpret. The more I study it the more I dislike it. The farmers meant well. But It does not answer the present difficulty. You should, therefore, give it your  own interpretation and act accordingly, without the slightest hesitation.
 I cannot, will not, impose a Cabinet on you. You must not have one imposed on you, nor can I guarantee approval by A. I. C. C. of your Cabinet and policy. It would amount to suppression. Let the members exercise their own judgment. If you do not get the vote, lead the opposition till you have converted the majority.
 Do you know that I have stopped civil disobedience wherever I have influence? Travancore and Jaipur are glaring examples. Even Rajkot I had stopped before I came here. I repeat that I breathe violence in the air. I see no atmosphere for non-violent action. Is not the lesson of Ramdurglibtech_505_footnotelibtech_506_footnoteenough for you?In my opinion it has done immense injury to the cause. It was, so far as I can see, premeditated. Congressmen are responsible for it as they were in Ranpur. Do you not see that we two honestly see the same thing differently and even draw opposite conclusions? How can we meet on the  political platform? Let us agree to differ there and let us meet on the social, moral and municipal platform. I cannot add the economic, for we have discovered our differences on that platform also.
 My conviction is that working along our lines, in our own way, we shall serve the country better than by the different groups seeking to work a common policy and common programme forged out of irreconcilable elements.
 I sent you wireslibtech_507_footnotefrom Delhi about my utter inability to go to Dhanbad. Rajkot I dare not neglect.
 I am well. Ba is down with malignant malaria. This is the fifth day. I brought her with me when she had already commenced it.
 I wish you will conserve your health by taking decisive action, leaving the result to God. Your reference to your father is touching. I had the pleasure of meeting him.
 
 
 I forget one thing. Nobody put me up against you.libtech_508_footnotelibtech_509_footnoteWhat I told you in Segaon was based on my own personal observations. You are wrong if you think that you have a single personal enemy among the Old Guard.

   LETTER TO AKBAR HYDARI  
 SHREE RASHTREEYASHALA, RAJKOT,
 April 10, 1939
 DEAR SIR AKBAR,
 Shri Ghanshyamsinh Gupta and Shri Deshbandhu Gupta have followed me to Rajkot to seek my advice after the utter breakdown of negotiations between the Government and the Aryasamaj by reason of
H. E. H’s Government’s denial of the reports about negotiations.
 I may state that for some time I have been advising the Aryasamaj friends who have regard for my opinions to suspend the civil disobedience part of their movement and give a chance to negotiations. I need not go into the reasons that actuated me to give the advice. The friends were seriously considering my advice, when a door seemed to them to open to its acceptance on grounds other than those I had advanced. I refer to the negotiations. They thought that if their minimum demand could be satisfied they would discontinue the civil disobedience. But as stated, their hope was frustrated. Now they want me to guide them as to the next step. They wanted to issue a manifesto stating their ground for entertaining the opinion that actual negotiations had started.
 On reading the manifesto I felt that before I could give them guidance I should write to you myself and know your own opinion.
 If the information I gather from the manifesto is true, the Nizam Government’s denial is inexplicable. Here are the relevant paragraphs from the draft manifesto which has been with-held for the time being at my instance:
 About the last week of February, the Divisional Commissioner and the
 
 Collector of Gulburga interviewed Mahatma Narain Swami Maharaj, the leader  of the movement, in Jail with a view to ascertain the grievances of the Aryas, and promised to move the higher authorities to explore the possibilities for an amicable settlement.
 On the 27th March, 1939, Mr. S. T. Hollins, the Director-General of Police and Jails, Hyderabad State, Nawab Ghos Yarjang Bahadur, Commissioner, Gulburga Division, Mr. Razvi, the Collector, Gulburga District, and the Superintendent, Gulburga Jail, interviewed Mahatma Narain Swamiji Maharaj, Kunvar Chand Karanji Sharda, Lala Khushalchandji and Swami Vivekanandji in the Gulburga Jail and Mr. S. T. Hollins made certain proposals, the substance of which was that H. E. H. The Nizam’s Government would take no objection whatever to the hoisting of the om flags, that no permission would be required for building yajnashalas and havan-kundas and all Aryasamajs and Mandirs at present existing  without  any  permission having been obtained would be recognized, and in the matter of building new temples, machinery would be povided to secure the granting of sanction within 15 days of the application, sanction not to be withheld on any ground other than the ground of its location being such as to give rise to communal disturbances and full liberty of preaching religious doctrines (dharma-prachar) with due regard to the feelings of the followers of other faiths would be secured.
 Mahatma Narain Swamiji and his colleagues expressed their wilingness to recommend the above proposals as the basis for negotiating the settlement, provided the settlement conformed to the spirit of the Sholapur Resolutions. Swamiji made it clear to Mr. Hollins that the authority to call  off  the satyagraha movement rested with the Serva Deshik Sabha.
 Mr. Hollins thereupon undertook to arrange a meeting of the representatives of the Sarva Deshik Sabha and the Government Officers concerned at Hyderabad and also to arrange for the transfer of Swamiji Maharaj and his three colleagues to Hyderabad for participating in the discussions. On the request of the Swamiji, Mr. Hollins and the Commissioner Nawab Ghos Yarjang Bahadur promised that the representatives of Sarva Deshik Sabha would not be molested and their records would not be seized or otherwise interfered with.
 Swamiji Maharaj, having been thus assured, called  Swami Swatantranandji, Secretary, Satyagraha Committee, Sholapur, by telegram and also forwarded the notes recording the substance of the above conversation duly countersigned by Jail Superintendent, to the President, Secretary and some other members of the Sarva Deshik Sabha. On the 7th instant when I,
 Messrs G. S. Gupta and Deshbandhu Gupta saw Narain Swamiji in Gulburga Jail, the Jail Superintendent told us that before putting his own signature he had shown the notes of the conversation contained in Swamiji’s letters to the Talukdar, Gulburga, and had got his approval.
 Swami Swatantranandji went to Gulburga and interviewed Narain Swamiji Maharaj who asked the former that an emergent meeting of the working committee of the Sarva Deshik Sabha should be immediately convened at Sholapur before 10th April 1939.
 Swami Swtantranandji convened the meeting at Sholapur and wrote to Sir Akbar Hydari sending him a copy of the gist of the conversation Narain Swamiji Maharaj had with Mr. Hollins and his colleagues and informing him that the representatives of the Sarva Deshik Sabha would be reaching Hyderabad to meet the state representatives on the 9th April to discuss the question and requesting him to communicate the time and place of the meeting.  In a letter dated the 1st April, 1939, Swami Swatantranandji also wrote to the Superintendent, Gulburga Jail, informing him that in addition to the members of the Executive body of the Internatinal Aryan League, the gentlemen named in the letter would represent the Sarva Deshik Sabha at the Hyderabad meeting.
 Swami Swatantranandji received a letter No. 2697, dated the 3rd April, 1939, from the Superintendent, Central Jail, Gulburga, which is  very important, as it throws considerable light on the present controversy; it reads as follows:
 “With reference to your letter No. 37060, dated the 31st March, ’39, received today, I write to inform you that it has been decided to hold the meeting of your representatives with Mahatma Narain Swami, Mr. Khushalchand and others at Gulburga but not at Hyderabad. Please get all your representatives to Sholapur and send to Gulburga by the morning mail of the 7th April, 1939, so that they may see Mahatma Narain Swami and others beforehand and be ready for the 8th instant to talk with the State officers.”
 “I assure you that your representatives would never be harassed by police nor would your papers be seized here provided there would be no demonstration on your part. Kindly let me know the date and time of their arrival at Gulburga by telegram so that necessary arrangements may be made here. I am writing this to you with the approval of the First Talukdar, Gulburga.”
 The letter speaks for itself and shows that the Jail Superintendent wrote with full authority because he distinctly states that the deputation was to meet the State officials on the 8th April, 1939.
 While the leaders of the Aryasamaj were on their way to Hyderabad, Hyderabad Government issued the surprising communique that the news
 published in certain sections of Press that H. E. H. the Nizam’s Government were negotiating with the International Aryan League with a view to arrive at some settlement or compromise was totally incorrect.
 The letter dated 3rd instant and signed by the Superintendent of the Central Jail, Gulburga, seems to be conclusive. I suggest that even if Mr. Hollins and other officials were over-enthusiastic and went beyond their authority, their action should be endorsed by H. E. H.’s Government for the sake of the good name if for nothing else. Public confidence in the word of such a great Government as H. E. H. the Nizam’s ought not to be shaken, but perhaps there is a sound answer to what prima facie appears to be unanswerable. May I expect an early reply?I am fixed up in Rajkot at present.

It pains me to note that you have shaken your responsibility off 	your shoulders. The Muslim and the Bhayat names to which you refer 	were nominated by you. My promise therefore meant and could be       
 interpreted to mean only that I on my part would help you to fulfil your promise even if the Chief Justice’s Award went against you. It passes my understanding how anyone can interpret my promise to give what I had no power to give. I am acting only as the Sardar’s and the Parishad’s trustee. It is obvious that I may not give anything outside the terms of my trust. Therefore, my promise can only mean that if you desire to retain the names in question, I would help you on behalf of the Sardar to do so subject to the majority of the Sardar’s names remaining intact. I hold that it is impossible to put more meaning into my word. Unfortunately you have taken an extraor- dinary step and thrust upon me the responsibility of accommo-dating in the Sardar’s list the names of your nominees. What pains one is that you should misconstrue my promise in a manner that would render nugatory the right secured by the Sardar.
 Therefore, although after your letter the only thing that remained for me was to send you seven names on behalf of the Sardar,  I entreated three out of the four nominees named by you to allow themselves to be included among the Sardar’s nominees and to work as one team with the rest. But my entreaty has ended on failure. I have exhausted all effort to honour your nominations if it were at all possible. You have mentioned a fourth name in your letter. I did not think it necessary to put Shri Mohan  Mandan  to  the  trouble  of coming to me to discuss things, as he is not a Harijan.
 The exclusion of the above four names, however, dose not mean that the representatives nominated by the Sardar will not guard the special and legitimate rights of Muslims, Bhayats, Harijans or any other section. These members recognized no caste distinctions so far as the Committee and service of the people are concerned. They have before them only the cause of the Rajkot people as a whole. They are on the Committee because the party they represent conducted the fight for the rights of the Rajkot people. You appreciated their endeavour and gave the right of nominating the names  of seven Rajkot State subjects outside the officials to the Sardar or the Parishad. These names are as below :
 Shri Popatlal Purushottam Anadalibtech_525_footnotelibtech_526_footnoteB.A., L L. B., ""  Popatlal Dhanji Malaviyalibtech_527_footnote ""  Jamnadas Khushalchand Gandhi,libtech_528_footnote

 Let me once more entreat you to listen to me. You say that you are unable to enlarge the Committe. This is not right. The Chief Justice’s Award does not mean any absolute obligation to limit the number of the Committee to ten. The two parties can make any alterations by mutual agreement. The Sardar is still desirous  of  helping you to keep your four nominess. The only condition is that the Parishad’s majority should not be affected in the extended Committee. According to the Chief Justice’s Award, the Sardar has a majority of four at present. Instead of that, for your sake and for the sake of avoiding bad blood, the Sardar is willing to reduce it to a majority of one.
Can you expect anything more?
 In your Notification of December 26th, the time-limit for the Committee to complete and submit its report to you was fixed at one month and four days. May remind you that the limit may not be exceeded?
 During the second satyagraha struggle there were confiscations, fines and other repressive measures. It is hardly necessary to remind you that these should be now cancelled.libtech_534_footnote

   LETTER TO RANJITSINH  
 April 15, 1939
 I have received your letterlibtech_537_footnotelibtech_538_footnoteof the 14th instant. I have personally explained to you that you are giving an entirely different meaning to my written promise. If the meaning which you have given is the real meaning of it, the result would be that I took a vow to give what I did not possess. I was then going to Delhi to obtain a decision from the Chief Justice. If that decision was against the Sardar I had nothing to give, because your representative was well protected. But if the decision was in favour of the Sardar and if the Sardar raised protest against the appointment of more than seven representatives. obviously your representative’s name would vanish. Only those persons could be in the list of the Sardar who could work as part of a team. Having this fact in view, I wrote a letter to you that you were safe because the Sardar would not protest if his purpose was served, and the Thakore Saheb would keep your name intact. The only meaning  of my  promise was that the Sardar would not raise any protest if his purpose was served. Where had I any authority to give a promise to others which would carry a meaning contrary to the above?libtech_539_footnote
It  appears  to  me   to  be   quite  clear   as  daylight  that,  if  your
 representative is not prepared to work as one team, it would be very clear to you that he cannot be included in the list of the Sardar. Therefore, if you intend to have your representative included in the
 
 Committee, you should request the Thakore Saheb to do so, and I have already written to him a  letterlibtech_540_footnote. As a friend  I tell you that your threat about agitaion and  satyagraha, etc., is out of place.libtech_541_footnote
 The Hindu,  18-4-1939
 
   STATEMENT TO THE PRESS libtech_542_footnote  
 April 15, 1939
 There has been for me unusual delay in sending on behalf of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel names of seven representatives to sit on the Reforms Committee in terms of the Thakore Saheb’s Notification of December 26 last and in terms of the Chief Justice’s Award. The delay shows the measure of my anxiety as well as Sardar Patel’s to include in the list the Thakore Saheb’s four nominees whose names he had published in his now defunct Notification of 21st January last. In accordance with the Award his nominees automatically dropped out, but the Thakore Saheb could have retained them with the co- operation of Sardar Patel. My first act on arrival in Rajkot on the 9th was to offer to His Highness in writing the Sardar’s co-operation in retaining the names. To my regret and to my astonishment the offer was summarily rejected. The public knows from the Thakore Saheb’s reply, which was handed to the Press on his behalf, in what terms it was rejected. He has allowed to be inferred that the Award left no scope for increasing the number of members of the Committee. On the face of it this is not right. With mutual consent there is ample scope for adjustment. The Thakore Saheb is not bound by the Award not to increase or even decrease the number on the Committee, if in wanting to do so he secures the Sardar’s co-operation.
 When this unfortunate decision became known to me, with the fullest co-operation of the Sardar I set about exploring means of accommodating at least two Muslim representatives and one Bhayat representative among the seven. This could not be done unless they could see their way to agree to work as one team with the Sardar’s other nominees. If this condition could not be fulfilled, the very object of giving the Sardar, i.e., the Parishad, the right to select all the
 
 seven members could be easily frustrated. But in spite of making all efforts it was humanly possible both for the Sardar and me to make, we failed and, therefore, the public will find that all the four nominees of the Thakore Saheb have been omitted.
 This, however, does not mean that the Committee will not represent all interests that could have been covered by the four nominees and several other interests, not specifically represented, for I have not known a single such committee in the world which could cover specifically and sectionally all imaginable interests. The very essence of democracy is that every person represents all the varied interests which compose the nation. It is true that it does not exclude, and should not exclude, special representation of special interests, but such representation is not its test. It is a sign of its imperfection.
 I do not claim perfection for the Rajkot committee, but any attempt on the part of the Sardar to accommodate all the special interests,without the indispensable safeguard that I have suggested, would have failed to produce  a constitution which could be satisfactorily worked in the interests of the whole of the people of Rajkot. I venture to suggest that the Sardar’s nominees have been selected after fulfilling the first indispensable condition of team- work, so that they would all make a conscientious effort to represent each in his own person the whole of the interests of the people of Rajkot. Therefore, it will be doubly the duty of the seven members to safeguard and protect all the special and legitimate rights of the Muslims, the Bhayats and the Harijans of the Rajkot State.
 As to the Harijan representation, I may say that Shri Mohan Mandan, the fourth nominee of the Thakore Saheb, an  estimable citizen of Rajkot though he is, is in no sense a Harijan any more than the seven nominees whose names have now been submitted to the Thakore Saheb on behalf of the Sardar.
 The Garasia Association has accused me in forcible language of a breach of promise in excluding their representative from the list of seven. All I can say is that they have hopelessly misread and misunderstood my letterlibtech_543_footnoteof March 11. I do not propose at present to go into the immediate circumstance in which I hastily penned my reply to their note, but it has got to be read in conjunction with the
 
 
 statementlibtech_544_footnotewith which I left Wardha on what I have described  as  a mission of peace. I then stated, as an indispensable condition of acceptance of any permutation and combination that might be offered for the composition of the Committee, that on it Sardar’s nominees should have at least a bare majority of one. The letter of March 11 has got to be read together with that condition. Nothing whatsoever happened on March 11 to make me waive that condition.
 Assuming for the moment that I forgot to incorporate the condition in my letter, the Garasia friends would be expected to read my letter with the missing condition. But I go a step further, that to read into my letter the meaning that the Garasia Association gives it, is to frustrate the very object which was sought to be secured by the Thakore Saheb’s letter to the Sardar. With the meaning that he  attached to it and which meaning the Chief Justice’s Award has fully upheld, I had no right to throw away that precious right. I should be guilty of a breach of trust if I did so. It should be remembered that the fast was taken for the purpose of vindicating the Sardar’s position and, therefore, if you like, to repair the breach of faith which I had imputed to the Thakore Saheb. The Award has done it. Is it to be expected that at a time when I was proceeding to Delhi in the full expectation of the Sardar’s contention being upheld, I was to undo in advance the effect of such a happy termination of the Delhi visit? I have more than fulfilled my promise contained in my letter of March 11 addressed to the Garasia Association by offering to reduce to one the majority of four which the Award gives to the Sardar’s nominees. I think I deserved better treatment from the Association. All their appeal should have been to the Thakore Saheb to seize the opportunity given by me of rehabilitating his nominees. Instead of choosing that obvious course, they have chosen the wrong course. I have reminded the Garasias that, when I returned from my self- imposed exile, at the end of 1914, I gave them ample proof of my friendship and concern for them. They had first  met  me  in Bhavnagar. Since then they have been off and on  seeking  my guidance and advice. Many of them know that it has been always at their disposal. But no mischief is yet done. As I have said, they may rest assured that all their just rights will be respected by the Sardar’s nominees.

It did not at all mean that I was in the least prevented 	by the      
 Sardar. The use of the word ‘trustee’ only meant that I cannot give a promise beyond my authority.
 You have written also about other matters to which it is possible to reply, but I did not wish to take your time. A time will come when you will agree that, in whatever I have written or said, there is no breach of promise, nor any disregard for your comrades. The words which you put in the mouth of the Sardar are nothing but an illusionlibtech_548_footnote. I have asked those who were present at that time. They heard like this: What guarantee can be believed regarding the rights of the Bhayats when the Paramount Power is investigating the rights of Princes?’ The meaning was that there is no permanency of rights in respect of anyone. Therefore, when you have a guarantee from the Parishad, you should accept it. You have misconstrued also my innocent words at the end. But what wonder is there that words uttered by either of the parties are misconstrued when mutual confidence is lost?

   STATEMENT TO THE PRESSlibtech_549_footnote  
 April 16, 1939
 What has hurt me most about this evening’s demonstrationlibtech_550_footnotelibtech_551_footnoteis that the demonstrators chose what was for me a solemn hour of the day. For years all India knows I have offered without practically a breach my evening prayers in open congregation. Why did thay seek my prayer time to molest me, and what had the numerous men, women and children, who at the end of the day had come to offer their humble prayers to the one and only God of us all, done to deserve such inter-ference? Why was it not enough, seeing that I do not go out except for prayers, to shout their slogans and wave black flags as I entered the prayer ground? Even that would have been bad enough. But they continued vigorously to shout their slogans throughout the prayers. And they were all my countrymen. Their cries pierced me like arrows whilst I was trying to concentrate my mind on the words of the prayers. I have not attained the power of meditation which makes one impervious to all disturbances from without. They knew that if they had invited me to attend their meeting in order to witness their hostile demonstration and their wrath, weak as I have been, I would have gone there and tried to appease them.
 I maintain I have not committed any breach of promise. To my knowledge, throughout my public and private career, I have never broken a promise. Here the very motive for a breach of promise is lacking. But lest I might have made a promise, however hastily, which could bear another meaning than one I had put upon my letter to the Bhayats of March 11, I asked as many legal friends in Rajkot as I could get together and warned them to give their unbiased opinion and told them that their reputation would be lost if they sought to support without full cause my own reading of my letter. I have their reasoned and unanimous opinion in my possession, fully supporting my meaning to the exclusion of any other.
 I fear the demonstrators have not served their cause by their unwarranted interference with the prayer of innocent  men  and women. There are tremendous difficulties in the way of getting due
 
 
 fulfilment of the Award of the Chief Justice. I am not free to go into these difficulties at the present stage. But I appeal to those who feel grieved at my conduct in excluding certain names from the Sardar’s list to bear with me. They may adopt all the just means to redress their grievances. The method they adopted today was very far from being just.

   UNHAPPY TRAVANCORE  
 The following is the substantial translation of the resolutions passed by the Working Committee of the Travancore State Congress in the first week of the monthlibtech_552_footnote:
 The working committee records its appreciation of the decision taken by the Acting President and the Council of Action to suspend civil disobedience pursuant to the advicelibtech_553_footnoteof Mahatma Gandhi. The working Committee desires  to emphasize the need at this juncture for local and taluk committees to concentrate on the constructive work and   strengthen the organizational side of the movement....
 Khadi: The working Committee appoints a sub-committee consisting of Sjts. Elankath Ramakrishna Pillai(Convener), G. Ramachandran and K. M. Bhoot-halingam Pillai to submit an exhaustive report on the  facilities available in the State for the spinning and weaving of khadi and to submit a scheme for the same. This committee is further directed to choose and recommend further centres where work can be immediately commenced.
 Indigenous weaving: For the purpose  of  encouraging  indigenous weaving (which is an important industry in the  State),  the  Working Committee constitutes Sjts. R. Shankar (Convener), K.S. Thangal and M.G. Koshi as a sub-committee to submit scheme for the same.
 Official goondaism: The Working Committee view with deep concern the rowdyism that is being inspired to suppress the State Congress activities. The Committee recalls the hooliganism instigated by the police in the State Congress meetings during the months of May and June last year. Until the release of political prisoners in November last, State Congress meetings were sought to be prevented either by prohibitory orders or by hooliganism or by declaring the State Congress illegal. After the release, though numerous
 
 
 meetings were held before the middle of January, there were no disturbances whatever. In the mean time the Government began recruiting what is called the special police. These special policemen have no uniform and their pay was fixed at Rs. 5 per month. Towards the middle of January 1939, these special policemen commenced attending meetings at Neyyattinkara and Parurtaluks. These so-called policemen and the rowdies under them have since been endeavouring to break up State Congress meetings. Even after annonucing
 on the 22nd the suspension of satya-graha,volunteer jathas and meetings for constructive work have been subjected to goondaism. . .
 Exhortation to workers: Last November, when the political prisoners were released, it was believed that we had at least secured the liberty to hold public meetings. The present situation, however, is worse than what existed in August last when the State Congress was declared illegal. The committee deeply appreciates the firm faith in non-violence evinced by those who attended the recent State Congress meetings. This rowdyism is the result of the persistent policy of repression continued by Government even after the suspension of satyagraha. Not only is the Government unwilling to grant any of the demands of the State Congress but it is continuing to arrest State Congress workers on some pretext or other and endeavouring to obstruct even the carrying out of the constructive programme of the Congress. Whatever be the force of the repression and the extent of rowdyism that the Government may release, the State Congress will continue its work awaiting further instructions from Gandhiji. While protesting against the  hooliganism inspired and encouraged by the Government the Committee exhorts the people to carry on the work of the Congress with courage and with non- violence.
I would like the workers to realize that events there have more
 than justified suspension of civil disobedience. The authorities have provided them with ample opportunity for the exercise of patience and restraint. They have also provided them with opportunity for suffering without civil disobedience. If, therefore, the workers can go through the ordeal without losing faith or heart and prosecute quietly and resolutely the constructive programme, swaraj will come automatically. This is a bold statement; some will call it ridiculous. Nevertheless it comes from the deepest conviction.
 What worries me, however, is the statement in the concluding paragraph that “the State Congress will continue its work awaiting further instructions from Gandhiji.” This declaration of faith in me is both touching and embarrassing. Let the workers know that whilst my
 
 advice and guidance are always at their disposal, I have no further instructions to give till new light dawns on me. I have prescribed a well-tried remedy. And I am quite capable of saying, “Go  on repeating it, for it is never-failing.’ I am not likely easily to advise resumption of civil disobedience. There is too much violence and untruth in the air to warrant resumption anywhere. And in the case of Travancore, as I have said resumption is superfluous.
 With reference to the alleged goondaism by the State, the public are bound to put implicit faith in the allegations, unless there is an impartial inquiry made. Surely the mere denial by the authorities, no matter how often repeated, can carry no conviction. Nor will it serve the intended purpose if a local white-washing commission is appointed. Confidence can be restored and truth brought to light only if the inquiry is made by outside judges of unimpeachable impartiality.

  	I have seen the handbill issued by the Rajkot Bhayats and 	Garasdars’s Committee. The allegations made therein are serious. 	What has come to my notice is completely the reverse of it. There is 	only one solution for it. We both may appoint an arbitrator and 	obtain his decision on all complaints.  	The object of my walking, instead of going in car, was plain, i.e., 	the processionists may have an opportunity to say and do what they 	might want to. In deciding to go on foot I was confident that they 	did not desire to cause any injury to my person. But, in case they 	were     
 inclined otherwise, I wanted them to feel that they had me wholly at their disposal.
 There is no Congress here. There is only Praja Parishad. No handbill was issued by it. Of course, I have issued a public appeallibtech_558_footnotewhich is sent herewithlibtech_559_footnote.

   LETTER TO RANJITSINH  
 April 17, 1939
 I notice in the papers that you intend to obtain the interpretation of my letter through the Chief Justice and that you have appealed to the Viceroy for it. I do not think that this is a fit case for the Chief Justice to be bothered with. Nor is there any room for persuasion on the part of the Viceroy in this behalf so far as I am concerned. If you people should desire it and the Chief Justice is agreeable, I, on my part, am always ready. My suggestion is that we may place this case before any Judge in Bombay. If reference to an arbitrator will satisfy you, I am quite game for it. But, there is one more condition and that is that, pending the reference to and decision by the arbitrator, the work of the Committee should not be held up. If your interpretation is accepted, I shall accept your representative by withdrawing one of the Sardar’s nominees from the Committee.
[PS.]
 While I was writing this letter, I received your second letter. The answer to it is included in the foregoing. But even if the Chief Justice takes up your reference, would it not be necessary to have an arbitrator to go into the allegations made in your handbill?libtech_560_footnote

  	I have received your letter. May a misunderstanding never arise 	between us hereafter. As soon as I saw in the papers I decided to 	writelibtech_562_footnoteto you 	that if you would be satisfied by the appointment of an  arbitrator 	there could possibly be no objection to it on my part.  	I suggest that we may select for the purpose some Judge in Bombay. I 	have no objection against the Chief Justice, but I am not prepared 	to give him all this trouble. It seems to me to be improper. That 	means that if you persist in it, you have to obtain his consent.  	Whoever is appointed as arbitrator, my condition should not be 	forgotten. The Committee’s work should not be held up till the 	arbitrator’s decision.  	You have not replied to my other requestlibtech_563_footnotelibtech_564_footnote, viz., that we  should obtain an arbitrator’s 	decision on the allegations  made  in  your today’s handbill.

 RAJKOT,
   CHI. 	NARAHARI,  April 	17, 1939 
  	I don’t get a single minute free. I am writing this in  the 	“library’. Ramji’s 	letter is enclosed.  	Qureshi’s salary may be raised. It would not be right for Sardar 	to pay his debt. That will not be to his good either. Let him give 	up other activities and mind the store only and pay off his debt.  	According to me he will be doing public service and will be 	contributing to Hindu-Muslim unity even by doing that. It wouldn’t 	be desirable that he should become altogether dependent on others. 	You may show all this to him. If, however, you yourself hold  a 	different view, please let me know.  	You must take whatever freedom may be necessary for your health. Why 	not consult the vaid who is treating Vasumati? Sometimes the 	remedies of such vaids succeed. Consult Dinshaw also. Don’t be 	negligent about regaining your health.

The 	Hindu, 2-5-1939    THE TRAGEDY OF TALCHER    	The reader will recall the twenty to twenty-five thousand refugees 	of  Talcher  State  in  Orissalibtech_567_footnotelibtech_568_footnote.   They  are,  	living  under  great difficulties in the forests of Angul in British 	Orissa. I rely upon these figures because they are vouched for by 	Thakkar Bapa and Shri Harekrushna Mahtab. Both of them have a 	reputation to lose. Moreover Thakkar Bapa is purely a humanitarian 	and social reformer of long standing. He does not dabble in 	politics.     
 Only a few days ago it was announced in the Press that a settlement had been arrived at and that the refugees were about to return to their homes. This news was immediately contradicted and it was stated that the Raja of Talcher had refused to honour the pact entered into by Major Hennessey, Assistant Political Agent for Orissa States North.
This was the pact signed on 21st March last:
  Reduction 	of the 	Miscellaneous Cess 	from five annas to 	three annas 	per rupee 	of rent, 	and an 	undertaking that 	after the settlement 	to be started 	about next 	November, the 	combined rent 	and cesses will 	not be higher 	than the Angul rent and cesses with the same classes of land.  The 	abolition of 	monopolies on 	the necessaries 	of life 	except hides, 	skins, horns, ganja, 	opium, bhang and liquors.  State 	administrative machinery 	should not 	be used for enforcing 	fines, etc., levied by 	Ecclesiastical Courts and Panchayats.  Compulsory 	labour (bethi 	) should be abolished 	except when 	necessary for public purposes and then on payment of wages at ordinary rates. The 	abolition of 	special taxes (poll-tax) 	on industrial castes.  There 	should be 	no victimization of 	refugees on 	their return 	to the 	States.  Constitutional 	Reforms enabling the 	people to 	participate in 	the administration 	through their representatives will be 	introduced as 	soon as 	the schemes 	are approved 	by the Political Department.  There 	shall be no interference 	with freedom 	of speech 	and meeting 	provided that 	there is 	nothing subversive 	or disloyal 	to the 	Ruler or 	his administration 	in those 	speeches or meetings.  People 	should be allowed 	to kill 	wild animals in 	the State 	on their 	own property 	without any penalties 	or fees. 
 There were present at the time Major Hennessey, F.R.S.A., I.A., BAR- AT-LAW, Major Gregory of the Military Intelligence Department, Shri Harekrushna Mahtab, Adjutant Woods of the Salvation Army, and the Revenue Commissioner representing the Orissa Government.
 Major Hennessey, I understand from Thakkar Bapa, was quite confident that he had the authority of the Raja of Talcher to sign the pact. How the Raja can now refuse to endorse it is difficult to understand.
But the mystery deepens when on recalls the terms of  the  sanad
under which the Raja holds Talcher. Here are the relevant clauses of
 the sanad issued to the small Orissa States by the present Viceroy on 26th February 1937 :
  That 	you shall 	do your 	utmost to suppress 	crime of all 	kinds in 	your State. That you shall administer justice fairly and impartially to all alike.  That 	you shall recognize and 	maintain the 	rights of 	all your people 	and on 	no account oppress, or 	suffer them in 	and way to 	be oppressed, and 	that, in 	particular, you 	shall charge yourself 	personally with the 	welfare of 	the aboriginal 	population of your State.  That 	you shall 	act in accordance 	with such advice as may 	be given to 	you by 	the Agent 	to the 	Governor-General, Eastern 	States, or 	such other Political 	Officer as may 	be vested 	with authority 	in this 	behalf by 	H. E. the Viceroy. 
 Under Clause 6 of the sanad the Raja is bound to act in accordance with such advice as may be given to him “by the Agent to the Governor-General, Eastern States, or such other Political Officer as may be vested with authority in this behalf by H. E. the Viceroy”.
 The Raja has therfore no option but to carry out the wishes of the Assistant Political Agent. The question is, why is there all this delay in carrying out the pact? The interests of over 20,000 refugees living on sparse food and practically without shelter are  at  stake. Delay is not only dangerous; it is criminal.

 DEAR MR. GIBSON,
   LETTER TO E. C. GIBSON  
 ANANDKUNJ, RAJKOT,
 April 19, 1939
 
  	I am lying on my back with severe headache and slight temperature 	which has up to now been diagnosed as gastric flu which seems to be 	raging about in Rajkot and especially in the house in which I am 	accommodated.  	I came here on the 9th instant. It is the 19th today. A matter which 	need not have taken more than a day has taken ten days. 	Unfortunately, we hold different view about the cause. I become 	confirmed in my opinion that Durbar Virawala is at the back of all 	this delay. I have proof enough which may not hold water in a court 	of law but it is enough for all practical purposes and certainly 	enough for me. I have no grudge against Durbar Virawala. I would 	love to convert him. It would be a triumph of non-violence if I 	could do so. And I could, if I had your active co-operation. But I 	know you cannot give it so long as you hold the very high opinion 	you do of his ability, efficiency and straight forwardness.  	I send you herewith copy of the latest letterlibtech_572_footnotefrom   the Thakore Saheb. It speaks for itself. If 	the proposition laid down in the letter were to be acted upon, there 	would never be a committee formed in terms of the Award of the Chief 	Justice of India. The whole plan laid out in Delhi bids fair to be 	completely frustrated if you, as the local representative of the 	Paramount Power, do not actively intervene. I invite your attention 	to the fact that in the Thakore Saheb’s letter to the Sardar dated 	the 12th January four out of the seven names were accepted. In an 	Appendix to the voluminous papers attached to the Thakore Saheb’s 	case, signed by Durbar Virawala as his political adviser, occurs the 	analysis of all the seven names recommended by the Sardar. Only two 	have been objected to because of their residential disqualification. 	How is it that now suddenly the qualifications of all but one have 	been challenged? And if I am to bear the burden that is sought to be 	placed upon me, there will be no end to the preliminaries and there 	will be no enquiry.  	I do not like the idea of troubling you or seeking the intervention 	of the Paramount Power. But I see there is no way out of    
 the difficulty.
 The Bhayats and Garasias Association has also taken up what I consider to be a most unreasonable attitude. As soon as I read in the papers that they wanted my so-called promise to be submitted to impartial scrutiny, I wrotelibtech_573_footnotelibtech_574_footnoteat once accepting the proposal. But as I sensed danger of interminable delay I said the proceedings ought not to interfere with the Committee’s work and that if their contention was upheld, the Bhayats’ nominee would immediately be accepted and one name withdrawn. The Association, however, would not listen to my proposal. They would hold up the formation of the Committee till the Judge was selected and his award was available. Acceptance of my proposal would not have resulted in the Committee functioning before the award but it would certainly have resulted in the  case  being decided expeditiously enough. I have given the opinion that the Chief Justice of India ought not to be troubled over the issue though I should have no objection to Sir Maurice adjudicating if the Government of India could be induced to invite him to do so and if he accepted the invitation. I have suggested instead a Judge of the Bombay High Court. I have no doubt that you could manage this thing easily. I suppose the Judge could fly here tomorrrow or the day after. I have not much to submit to him nor can the Bhayats have much either. The Judge need not take long to give his judgement. What I fear and suspect is that there is no desire anywhere to play the game. You do not mind my thinking aloud before you. I would be less than just to you if I suppressed my innermost thoughts whilst I looked up to you as the local Crown Representative to see that the Committee was properly set up and its work proceeded with, smoothly and without delay.
 I must leave Rajkot on the 24th instant by the 1.10 afternoon train and hasten to Calcutta, thence to Brindaban. I would return here at the earliest possible moment which cannot be before the 7th proximo. Meanwhile Shri Dhebarbhai will be acting on my behalf. But I hope that during the five days that I am here, much work will have been done.
 May I remind you that my fast was only suspended and if all my efforts fail and no headway is made I must resume it? It won’t be without serious reflection. I do not want to do so. I have not the
 
 physical energy for it. But a peremptory call of duty knows no mundane difficulty. The matter is so serious that I would like you to convey at least the substance of this letter to His Excellency. I am loath to interfere with his much-needed rest. If you think that there is substance in my complaint and that you have the will and the powers to deal with it I would much rather that His Excellency were kept undisturbed.
 Of course I am at your disposal, if you think that a personal talk is necessary; in that case you need not mind my fever. I will come. I have an appointment with Dr. Ambedkar for half past eleven.
 For the moment I am not replying to the Thakore Saheb’s letterlibtech_575_footnote.

   LETTER TO E. C. GIBSON  
 ANANDKUNJ, RAJKOT,
 April 20, 1939
 DEAR MR. GIBSON,
 This is the offer which you admitted as sporting, and which I made at our interview. I must confess that it was born of despair. I am tired of fighting unseen forces in Rajkot—a situation I have never been obliged to face throughout my life. The offer is that Parishad should withdraw from the proposed committee altogether and that the Thakore Saheb should nominate his own committee in terms of the Notification, that this committee should be formed at once and should present its report to the Thakore Saheb within one month and four days from its formation.
 If the Constitution that will be framed by the committee is not in terms of the Notification, the Rajkot Rajya Praja Parishad, represented by the seven nominees, should have the right to dissent from it and the Committee’s report, and the dissenting report should be submitted to the Chief Justice of India as if the Parishad was represented on the Committee in terms of the Award.
 I had expected to send the note at once but as I told you my offer might create consternation among the Parishad people and so it did. The method I have adopted is a novel method. As I said in my
 
 letterlibtech_577_footnotelibtech_578_footnoteof yesterday, the Parishad was entitled to have the terms of the Chief Justice’s Award enforced by the Paramount Power. The suffocating atmosphere made me suddenly think of the  drastic  remedy I suggested to you. The offer I made to you carried no reservation but I did not want to do violence to my colleagues and therefore I gave time for discussion, telling them that it was open to them to repudiate my offer, for I had no such absolute powers as I arrogated to myself during our talk. I could have said, though I felt like it when making the offer I did, I should consult my colleagues before I gave my final word. I did not feel like taking that precaution. Such was the strength of my conviction as to the correctness of the position I took up. There seemed to me no way out of the hopeless unreality of the situation. I am happy to be able to say that my colleagues, though they are filled with grave doubts, recognize the correctness of the position.libtech_579_footnote

 Mahatma Gandhi, in a letter to Mr. Virawala, declines to have the Reforms Committee elected on the basis suggested by Mr. Virawala.

           DEAR 	MR. GIBSON,    LETTER TO E. C. GIBSON        RAJKOT,  April 	23, 1939 
  	I had full five hours’ discussion yesterday with Durbar Shri 	Virawala and the enclosed rejection of my sporting offer is the 	result. The Parishad Committee hangs in the air. And the formation 	of the committee promises to be still further delayed pending  the 	investigation of the meaning of my promise so-called, whereas my 	consent to the reference to arbitration is conditional upon the 	formation of the committee not being delayed.  	I take it that if the question of determining the meaning of the 	expression “State subjects” is referred to the Judicial 	Commissioner the reference will be shown to my representative Shri 	Dhebarbhai and that the Parishad will have the right, if necessary, 	to be represented by     
 counsel. All this need not be necessary if the pure legal point is referred to the Judicial Commissioner on a joint statement of the case.
 Lastly, the question of remission of fines, etc., still remains and is passed over.libtech_585_footnote
   [PS.]  Yours sincerely,    	I take it that the correspondence between us may be released for 
 publication.  From 	a copy: C. W. 10185. Courtesy: D. B. Kalelkar      SPEECH AT PRAJA PARISHAD WORKERS’ MEETING, 			RAJKOTlibtech_586_footnote    April 	23, 1939  	As you know for the last fifteen days I have striven hard to find  a 	solution to the Rajkot tangle. But I am sorry to have to confess to 	you that in this I have failed. I am most grieved over our failure 	to arrive at a settlement with the Bhayats and the Mussalmans. But I 	have the conviction, and I want you to share that conviction with 	me, that our labour has not been wasted. Providence has its 	appointed hour for everything. We cannot command results ; we can 	only strive. And so far as I am concerned it is enough satisfaction 	for me to know that I have striven my utmost to dicharge the duty 	that rested on me.  	In  making  my  ‘sporting  offer’  to    Mr.  Gibson  yesterdaylibtech_587_footnote,  I know I was making a big surrender; I could have 	demanded that the Thakore Saheb be made to implement his promise in 	full, and if I had insisted on it, the Paramount Power would have 	probably been forced to intervene.  	But I felt that such a course, though legitimate, would under the 	circumstances not be the best course for any of the parties 	concerned.       Vide 		footnote on 		“Letter to 		E. C. Gibson”, 		19-4-1939; also “Letter 		to E. C. 		Gibson”, 20-4-1939  
 And so I chose instead the alternative of putting your head into the lap of the ‘enemy’.
 Let me explain to you the working of my mind in making that offer. I hold it to be an axiomatic truth that true ahimsa never fails to impress itself on the opponent. If it does, to that extent it is imperfect. All the time that I have been engaged in the Rajkot question, this question has been forcing itself upon me: ‘Why has our ahimsa failed to gain recognition from the State authorities ?’ In South Africa whatever the Indians had won as a result of satyagraha did not leave any ill-feeling behind it. For eight long years General Smuts fought uncompromisingly against the claims of the Indian community. But in the end he recognized the justice of the claims and became my lifelong friend. He helped me a great deal even in London during the Round Table conference and had he his way he would have helped me to get everything. When the final settlement was arrived at in South Africa he had said: “I on my part had inflicted severe hardships on Gandhi’s men but they had borne them silently. How long could I inflict severities on such people ?”
 Do not believe that it is more difficult to win over Virawala than it was to win over General Smuts. Time and again the question arises in my mind: ‘Why should what was possible in South Africa be not possible here? Why can’t Virawala say the same thing which General Smuts had said?’ What was possible in South Africa should be  possible in Rajkot too. There we were a handful of Indians pitted against the entire Boer population. Here numbers are on your side. There our fight was against a Government and the governments are always fettered by rigidity. But here you have only to gain entrance into the heart of one man. Surely there must be something seriously wrong about us and our ahimsa if we cannot do even that. I want you to put your supreme effort into this. To say that there can be no peace in Rajkot so long as Durbar Virawala is there, is to speak not the language of ahimsa but of himsa. The attribute of ahimsa is to run straight into the mouth himsa. If the cows had wisdom they would in full understanding run straight into the mouth of a lion and if they did so it is possible that the lion would lose the taste for cow’s flesh.
 I have been holding a silent court of enquiry within myself. How is it that I came to Rajkot on a mission of peace but have ended by antagonizing Durbar Virawala and the State authorities? I had banked upon the ancestral family relationship existing between me
 
 and the Thakore Saheb, but instead I had to seek the intervention of the Paramount Power. ‘What a lapse from grace is this?’ I said to myself. I feel crestfallen and humbled. Should I absolve  the Paramount Power altogether from its promise? Or should I confess my folly from the house-tops? I have been thinking furiously on these lines. But my self-confidence seems to have deserted me for the moment. However, I leave the thoughts with you for what they are worth to ponder and think over. Capacity to convert the heart of Durbar Virawala is the acid test of your ahimsa as it is of mine.
 The discovery I have made after introspection is this. No matter what concessions you succeed in getting from the State authorities, it is only to the extent they are the result of a true heart-conversion on their part that you will be able to enjoy or digest them. But if you wish to launch a successful satyagraha to win your rights, your speech must improve. If you do so, your actions and general behaviour will take a different form. Ahimsa is not the weapon of the coward. It is the highest manly effort. It is the dharma of the brave. If you wish to be a satyagrahi you should get rid of ignorance, indolence and the like. You must cultivate constant vigilance. There should not be any trace of inertia in you. Only then can ahimsa function. When you have imbibed true ahimsa, your speech, action and general behaviour will reflect love and willy-nilly your enemies will have to recognize it.
 Let me explain my meaning further by an illustration. Yesterday I was engaged for five hours in a talk with Durbar Virawala. He was the same as before. But I had gone there with the dawn of a fresh spirit, as a result of my heart-searching, upon me. My reaction to him this time was different. ‘We are after all what nature has made us, and it is no use quarrelling with nature’, I said to myself, and I tried to get as much as I could to get under his skin, to view questions from his own angle. I did not mince matters and even told him some home truths. Gently, in my own language, I gave him a glimpse of his crookedness. But there was no irritation on my part or resentment on his. It was a different atmosphere. He said: “ It is my bad luck that I cannot convince you of my inability to give you more than this”. I replied; “ I agree that I am prejudiced against you. I am afraid of you. But I am prepared to be locked up with you in a room till we arrive at unanimity Please remove my fears.” Khan Saheb Fateh Mohammad Khan was also present on the occasion. He also joined the discussion and pressed Durbar Virawala somehow or other “ to find  a solution for the agitation. People are tired of it.”
 I have not the time to share with you  all  the  pleasant recollections of this interview. But there was one thing in this interview that galled me and to which I draw your attention. He had an unmixed contempt for the Parishad people. I had noticed that before too but I had laughed it away. But now it hurt me. Why should your satyagraha excite his contempt of all things? I can understand ahimsa inspiring a kind of fear, the sort of fear that a mother feels when her child gets offended and goes to sleep hungry. But genuine satyagraha should never excite contempt in the opponent even when it fails to command regard or respect. This is not super-refinement on my part. Satyagr- aha is nothing if not a ceaseless quest after perfection. A satyagrahi therefore turns the searchlight inward relentlessly to weed-out the defects that may be lying hidden there still. Thereby he increases his capacity to serve the cause he has espoused a thousand fold.
 Tell me if this definition of ahimsa is beyond you and you are free to choose your own path. I will render all possible help from outside.
 I have asked you always to rely upon your own inner strength instead of banking upon outside help. But I now want you to go a step further and wish to see a different kind of strength in you. you must now cease to look for guidance from without. Satyagraha should become to you an independent inspiration. It should be intolerable for you and me both that you should depend in every little thing on my advice. I am therefore going away, throwing the whole burden on you. You must make a firm resolve that you will now arrive at a settlement according to your inner light and conviction and that, too, with Durbar Virawala, not without him. Now you will have to make your choice between ahimsa and himsa. You may drop ahimsa if you find that it does not suit you or is likely to make cowards of you. I only wish that you should never become cowards. It is possible that some day you will come to learn pure ahimsa from disciplined himsa. But it is a dangerous condition if you, like Trishanku,  keep on hanging in mid air between himsa and ahimsa. The country is also faced with this same problem as you are. You should solve it for yourself immediately. If you cling to ahimsa, that ahimsa should not be the one bequeathed by me but should orginate from independent inspiration. But if you decide to follow the path of ahimsa, then you should know that it will be an empty name unless it aims at the conversion of the heart of the opponent.
 
 Let me offer you a few concrete suggestion in this connection. If you accept the approach that I have indicated, I would like all the seven of you, whom the Sardar has nominated, to go to Durbar Virawala and tell him that you have decided to relieve me of all responsibility in connection with Rajkot, that you would also like to relieve the Paramount Power too of its responsibility in this behalf and rely instead entirely on your capacity to induce him to implement the Notification of December 26. Ask him to tell you as to what you should do to win his heart. Hold yourself in readiness to drain to the last the bitter cup of personal indignities and humiliations. It was only when I had learnt to reduce myself to a zero that I was able to evolve the power of satyagraha in south Africa.
 Ahimsa must express itself through acts of selfless service of the masses. I cannot think of a better symbol of it or medium for its expression than the spinning-wheel.
 Ahimsa is a science. The word ‘failure’ has no place in the vocabulary of science. Failure to obtain the expected result is often the precursor to further discoveries. It is in that spirit that you should approach and pursue your present mission.

I never knew that  I was 	old. Now I am weighed down by the knowledge of decrepitude.  I never 	knew what it was to lose hope. But it seems to have been cremated in 	Rajkot. My ahimsa has been put to a test such as it has never been 	subjected to before.  	I have given fifteen precious days to have the Committee, 	contemplated in the Award of the Chief Justice of India. But I seem 	to be as far from it as ever. I have found unexpected difficulties 	in my path. The Award was acclaimed throughout India as a complete 	victory for the Sardar. But it has been effectively used against me 	for accusing me of a breach of promise to the Muslims and the 	Bhayats.      The 	Hindustan Times and 	The Hindu on 	April 25. 
 The promise that the Thakore Saheb had made was on my return from Delhi transferred to my poor shoulders. The plain meaning of all I had said could only be that I should help the Thakore Saheb to carry out his promise, though, according to the Award, I need not. Whatever the reason might be, both the Muslims and the Bhayats relieved the Thakore Saheb of the duty of fulfilment of the promise.
 Failing to placate the Muslims and the Bhayats, I sent the  Thakore Saheb seven names of the Parishad. In reply I was called upon to prove that six out of the seven names were Rajkot State subjects. One would have thought that I would at least be given an inkling of the objections. If every statement made by men presumed to be fairly honourable could be challenged, it might take a year to finish an inquiry into the facts of each case. But I have sent the required proofs.
 When I seemed to have come to the end of my resources and my patience, I sent a letter of complaint to the Resident as the local representative of the Paramount Power seeking his aid in terms of the Viceregal assurances given to me. He invited me to an interview. And whilst we were discussing the ways and means an idea flashed across my mind that I should end the agony by forgoing the right of nomination of members of the Committee, and so I made what I thought, and the Resident admitted, was a sporting offer. It was that the whole Com-mittee should be selected by the Thakore Saheb to report in accordance with the terms of the Notification of 26th December last, provided that its report should be shown to the Parishad, and that if they found that the report did not carry out the terms of the Notification, their dissenting note and the original report should be sent to the Chief Justice for his decision. The Resident sent my offer to Durbar Shri Virawala, but H. H. the Thakore Saheb has turned it down.
 Agonizing experiences of the fifteen days have resulted in my making the discovery that my ahimsa should be voted down as failure if the Thakore Saheb and Durbar Shri Virawala were to feel that they had to give anything under pressure from above. My  ahimsa demanded that I should remove that feeling. And so when the opportunity came to me, I tried to assure Durbar Shri Virawala that I took no delight in invoking the assistance of the Paramount Power. Apart from ahimsa, my connection with Rajkot should impose that restraint on me. I assured him that my spontaneous offer to
 Mr. Gibson was an effort in that direction. He immediately retor- ted:“But if you are not satisfied with His Highness’s Committee’s report, you claim the right to scrutinize the report in the light of the Notification, and if the Parishad dissents you want to have the report and the dissent to be examined by the Hon. the Chief Justice of India. Do you call this removing the feeling of pressure? Why not turst His Highness and his adviser through and through? You may not get all you want, but whatever you get will be charged with his goodwill and will carry a promise of full delivery. Do you know what the Parishad people have said about the Thakore Saheb and me? Is that the way of  a people desiring reforms from their Prince?” There was bitterness in his speech and contempt for the Parishad people. But with the sudden consciousness of my imperfect handling of ahimsa, instead of carrying the blow, I recognized the force of his argument as showing want of faith in the essential goodness of human nature and littleness of my own belief in ahimsa. And so our conversation went on and covered many proposals. But it was inconclusive. I was no nearer solution of the tangle. Nevertheless, I parted with the feeling that we had come to know each other better, and that in trying to woo Durbar Shri Virawala I was on the right track.
 And so I presentedlibtech_592_footnotelibtech_593_footnotethis new line of approach to my co-workers. They had more than once told me that Durbar Shri Virawala was the source of all the evil that had descended upon Rajkot and that his removal would mean for them full swaraj. I had no difficulty in showing them that what they were thinking of was good government, not self- government. At this meeting, which only took  place yesterday, I told them that if they accepted my explanation of ahimsa, they would have to set their heart not on getting rid of Drubar Shri Virawala, but on converting him. This they could do only if they would set about finding his good points and working at them. They must develop infinite faith in the capacity of ahimsa to neutralize every person of himsa. True ahimsa lay in running into the mouth of himsa. If cows could be credited  with  intelligence, it is conceivable  that given a sufficient number of such cows who would run into the tiger’s mouth, the latter would lose the relish for cow flesh and change his nature. They must, therefore, shed their fear of Durbar Shri Virawala and their disbelief in the power of ahimsa to achieve the seemingly impossible.
 
 They listened to this (to them ) new doctrine with attention. I did not ask them whether they were convinced. I hope they were. They would quite legitimately have asked me: ‘Are you yourself so convinced of the correctness of this extraordinary attitude you have commended to us as to tear the Award to pieces and simply rely upon the goodness of Durbar Shri Virawala’s heart?’ If they had asked this question, I would have been obliged to say: ‘I have not yet found the requisite courage. Ahimsa accrues only to the courageous.’
 And so I have left empty-handed, with body shattered, hope cremated. Rajkot has been to me a priceless laboratory. My patience has been sorely tried by the tortuous politics of Kathiawar. I have asked the workers to confer with Durbar Shri Virawala, to forget me and Sardar Patel, and if they get enough to satisfy their least wants, they may accept the offer without reference to either of us. I have told Durbar Shri Virawala, ‘ I am defeated. May you win. Placate the people by giving as much as possible and wire to me so as to revive the hope which I seem to have lost for the moment.’

   POPULAR VIOLENCE IN RAMDURG  
 I have said not a word about Ramdurg up to now. I had a wire from Dr. Hardikar not to commit myself till I had heard from him. And Rajkot left me not a moment for any other work. I have only now on the train read the report prepared by Shris Diwakar, Kaujalgi and Hardikar. I have also a revealing note from Shri Diwakar. I have studied Shri Ganga-dharrao Deshpande’s note on the tragedy. I had a visit from Shri Munnavali, President of the Praja Sangh, and Shri Magadi. The report of Shris Diwakar, Kaujalgi and Hardikar is a dispassionate document and satisfactory in so far as it goes. This is its conclusion:
 In the end we feel that the officers have acted tactlessly to a great extent and allowed the police to have their way. We believe that they could have controlled the situation if they had acted a little more patiently and put the workers of the Praja Sangh on their honour as they had done many a time. But though there was provocation, we do not think that it was so great as to arouse the brute in man and it must be laid at the door of the highly inflammable temper of the people. They seemed to have readily believed the rumours and
 got infuriated.
 But there is absolutely no justification for any kind of violence even under the greatest provocation. In fact, the greater the provocation the greater is the opportunity and necessity for showing a non-violent spirit. That being our ideal we cannot defend any the slightest violence under any circumstances. The events only show that the Praja Sangh had no control over the forces of violence which were hiding in the people. It is a matter for the deepest regret, and this tragedy is sure to act detrimentally against all popular movements in States. It is a clear warning to all workers in the field and everyone must realize that before one feels sure that the people are rightly trained and disciplined in non-violence it is unwise to begin any great mass movement.
A study of the evidence before me leads me to the conclusion
 that whatever the provocation, the popular fury was wanton, cruel and deliberate. Over two thousand villagers had collected with the set purpose of wreaking vengeance. They were intent upon releasing the President and the other prisoners. Congressmen cannot escape blame for the savagery of the people. The villagers were having the wrong lesson given to them. Ranpur in Orissa was the first finger-post. Ramdurg is the second. No one has denied the fact that the Raja Saheb of Ramdurg was a friend of the Congress. He deserved better treatment. I am not just now concerned with the turth or otherwise of the evidence on provocation. There are grave enough charges. But it has never been the Congress policy to plead provocation, howsoever grave, in justification of popular violence. We shall lose all if we play with this fundamental provision of the Congress. I had remarked before the Ramdurg outbreak that I smelt violence in the very air I was breathing. I am very sensitive to the slightest exhibition  of  violence or untruth. They are twins.
 I am quite clear that the Provincial Congress Committees as well as the Working Committee when it is formed must take strong measures to purge the Congress ranks of violence in thought, word and deed. What little I read of the public Press shows that there is often a departure from truth and non-violence. How this evil can be remedied I do not know. The Press managed or owned by Congressmen might be amenable to moral control. I am, however, inclined to think that the greatest mischief is done by Congressmen working in the villages. It ought not to be difficult to bring these under rigid discipline.
I suggest an impartial enquiry into the events. The Karnataka
 Provincial Congress Committee should entrust it to a High Court Judge. If the Raja Saheb will help, the task will be easy. But even if he does not, there should be no difficulty in getting at the truth.
 There is another untoward result of the Ramdurg movement. It has taken communal turn. There are two parties, Brahmin and non- Brahmin. My own feeling has hitherto been that Karnataka had remained fairly free from the curse. But the cuttings and papers that have been sent to me show that the evil has gone deep enough to demand an immediate remedy. I have been asked to offer guidance in the matter. It would be presumptuous on my part to  give  any guidance without a proper study on the spot of the tension. I can only suggest that if there are enough Brahmins and non-Brahmins interested in removing the tension, they should tour the affected area, find out causes and deal with them. The tension is a symptom of the growing spirit of violence in the country.

   INTERVIEW TO “THE STATESMAN”libtech_600_footnote  
 April 27, 1939
 QUESTION: Had Mr. Gandhi come to Calcutta on a peace mission seeing that he had advised Sardar Patel not to come to Calcutta?
ANSWER : Yes. The reason for Sardar Patel not coming was that it
 was  in   the   best  interests  of  the country  to	absent himself from Calcutta.
 Q.	Had Mr. Gandhi found a way out of the conflicting demads?
 A.. I have not come with a solution in my pocket. I have no pocket. I cannot say what will be the result of my talks with Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose. What is the use of forecasting when the result will be known soon ?
 Q.	Had Mr. Gandhi heard it said that Mr. Bose was an undesirable man?
 A.. I never heard that. He was elected by the Congress.  He could not be in the Congress so long if he was an undesirable man. I have no reason to believe that Mr. Bose is “undesirable”.
 Q.	Has Mr. Bose shown a desire to be more accommodating since the Tripuri
  vote?       talks?   A.. 	He is acting in accordance with certain principles he holds.  Can the latest note— 34 pages—from Mr. Bose form a basis of peace    A.. 	Thirty-four pages? I did not count them. The correspon- 
 dence 	must form the basis of our conference.    
 Q.	Had Pandit Nehru reported to him on his recent talks with Mr. Bose at Dhanbad?
 A.. Yes.
 Q.	Were they favourable?
A.	Always. All Congress people work for peace.
 Q.	Would a final rupture with Mr. Bose divide the Congress?
 A.	Of course it would. But why should there be a rupture? I am hoping for a settlement.
 Q.	Has it been the case that Mr. Bose’s orders have been disobeyed by subordinate Congress bodies?
 A.	I do not know of single case of disobedience, and if I did, I would be greatly surprised. He is the congress President.
 Q.  Was he, Mr. Gandhi, not responsible, indirectly, for this as, when during  his fast, Congress Ministries threatened to resign independently of directions from Mr. Bose?
 A,	There could be no resignations without reference to the President. There is no question of insubordination.
 Q. Has the non-existence of the supreme Congress executive, the Working Committee, for such a long time delayed Congress decisions on larger issues like Federation, formulation of its policy and war?
 A.. There has been some delay. The non-existence of the Committee is a cause, and delay in that case is inevitable.
 Q.	Is it true that during the Munich crisis the Committee was in continuous session at Delhi to decide on Congress attitude to war?
A., Yes. We discussed thoroughly our policy of non-violence.
 Q.	Can  the  present	“tangle” be said to be weakening the Congress bargaining power with the British?
A.. I should not say “bargaining” but “settlement”.
 Q.   Since the Congress  impasse there has been no Parliamentary Committee  to control the work of the Congress Provincial Ministries. Has this  led  to  independent action by the Ministries?
A.. Not to my knowledge.
 Q.	What is the present machinery to give advice to the Ministries? Do they ask for your or Sardar Patel’s advice?
A.	The machinery is the President. Sardar Patel’s or my
 opinions are not asked for. I have been out of it since my retirementlibtech_601_footnotefrom the Congress.
 Q. Would the Central Congress be able to get the Congress Ministries to work in the same spirit under a new Parliamentary Committee, when it is formed, as  of old?
A.	I see no reason why they should not.
 Q.	Has it not been a good thing that the Provinces have regained independence of action?
A.	They have not regained it. The President is there with as
much power as the old Board had.
 Q.	Apart from purging the Congress of corruption, what would he suggest as necessary to set up the Congress as a well-knit party organization?
A.	The purging of corruption is the first indispensable condi-
 tion to the smooth running of the Congress. Once the corruption is banished the Congress will carry on its great work.
 Q.	Would  it   be  better  for	the Congress to have a really democratic constitution, or to be entirely subject to a leader?
A.	The Congress does not lack democracy. The Congress is
dem-ocratic.
 Mr. Gandhi then gave the following special message to the Statesman readers : I can assure them all that we are not going to discuss personalities but policies. Mr. Bose discussed principles only in his correspondence with me. So far as I recollect, there were no person-
alities or grievances in his communications to me. But I have vivid
recollections of seeing principles and policies in the letters.
 Mr. Gandhi then repeated his Rajkot statement :
 Ahimsa accrues only to the courageous and so I have left Rajkot empty- handed with body shattered and hope cremated. I have told Mr. Virawala: “I am defeated. May you win. Placate the people by giving as much as possible and inform me so as to revive the hope which I seem to have lost for the moment.”
 Rajkot seems to have robbed me of my youth. I never knew that I  was old. Now I am weighed down by the knowledge of decrepitude. I never knew what it was to lose hope. But it seems to have been cremated in Rajkot.
 Mr. Gandhi went on to say :
 I am broken down. I am now conscious of old age. It was useful when people said, “Hello, 70 years—no, 17”. Now I feel myself to be even 80.
 
 
 
days.
 Mr. Gandhi has developed a cough and, commenting on this, said:
I  am a  stranger to a  cough. Yet this has been persisting for 15
 
The reporter then asked Mr. Gandhi if there was going to be a war. His reply
  was 	to the effect that the journalist would probably know more about 	that than he himself. However, Mr. Gandhi went on to say in his 	opinion the best way for peace was to disarm. [He said:]  	If I could get the three great nations. Great Britain, France and 	the U.S.A with a tithe of my faith in non-violence there would be no 	war.  He 	did not agree that in the event of the nations disarming, Germany 	and Italy would march into other countries and even take British 	colonies.  	The people of Germany and Italy would not want war. Their leaders 	would realize that too. The leaders dare not go to war. Peace will 	reign in the universe. If I were a leading statesman in England, I 	would shudder at the prospect of war.  At 	the close of the interview, Mr. Gandhi gave the following message:  	I am fighting for peace, I shall die for peace, peace in the Cong- 	ress, peace in the States, peace on earth and goodwill amongst men. 	To set the seal upon that, if I feel the power, I am quite capable 	of fasting unto death to prevent Western humanity, which is getting 	ready to embark upon suicide on a scale hitherto unknown to the 	history of the world.  Referring 	to his talks with Mr. Bose, he said: All 	India hopes and I hope that there will be no rupture.  The 	Statesman, 28-4-1939    LETTER TO MUNNALAL G. SHAH

  	I have read your letter. You should go away from Segaon for some 	time. Perhaps that will give you peace of mind. I hope you will not 	suffer the same fate as Janakiprasad did.

As I have told you in my letters 	and my telegrams, I feel myself utterly incompetent to do so. Much 	has happened since Tripuri. Knowing your own view, knowing how you 	and most of the members differ on fundamentals, it seems to me that 	if I give you names, it would be an imposition on you. I have argued 	this position at length in my letters to you. Nothing that has    
 happened during the three days of closest conversation between us has altered my view. Such being the case you are free to choose your own Committee. I have told you, too, that you could discuss with the ex-members the possibility of mutual approach and that  nothing would please me better than to know that you were able to come together. Into what has happened since, I need not go. You and the ex-members present will make the position clear before the A. I. C. C.

 DEAR SISTER,
   A  LETTERlibtech_605_footnote  
 
 
 SODEPUR, CALCUTTA,
 April 29, 1939
  	I learnt from Chi. Krishnachandra’s letter that your daughter is 	no more and that you are grief-stricken. But why grieve over death? 	One who is born must die. Some will die today, some tomorrow. That 	is why the wise tell us that birth and death are in the hands of 	God. We should remember it and put up with death. But the death of 	the dear ones must certainly teach us to remember their virtues and  	also emulate them. May 	God grant you peace.  Your 	brother,  M. K. GANDHI  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G. N. 4313; also S.G. 130      JAIPUR PRISONERS    	The Jaipur Durbar communique on the treatment of Sheth Jamnalal 	Bajaj and the other prisoners reads like a laboured defence of the 	status quo. The question about Sheth Jamnalalji is simple. It 	is admitted that he is locked up in an out-of-the-way placelibtech_606_footnotewhere the water is said to be ‘heavy’ according 	to the Indian notion. It is admitted that the place is difficult of 	access. He has been given no companion. Why this isolation? Is he a 	dangerous character? Is he an intriguer? One can understand 	detention as he chose to defy the ban on his entry into his own 	birth-place.  	The Authorities know that Shethji is an ideal prisoner. He believes 	in meticulous observance of Jail discipline. It is  cruel  to 	isolate him as he has been isolated from the outside  world.  The 	greatest want of prisoners is the companionship of their equals in 	thought, manners and customs. I suggest that without much ado he be 	transferred to a place which is easily accessible and healthy and 	where he is allowed company.     
 The special pleading with reference to the satyagrahi prisoners in Lamba is much worse. They admit that the place selected for their incarceration is an old snake-infested fort. But they point out that in spite of the place being snake-infested no one has as yet been bitten by the reptiles! Must the Jaipur Durbar’s cosnscience wait for snake- bites before it is stirred to action? It should be remembered that these pris-oners were transferred to Lamba because they had the presumptuousness to hunger-strike for better treatment. The strike would have continued but for my intervention.
 The much larger question of the object of satyagraha still remains unsolved. And yet it is not at all large. It is aimed at getting the Praja Sangh recognized. The Durbar have laid down  the  impossible condition of recognition. viz., that its officials should not be members of any political organization out-side the State. Thus Sheth Jamnalalji himself could not remain President of the Sangh because he is connected with the National Congress. Satyagraha has been suspended at my instancelibtech_607_footnotelibtech_608_footnotein Jaipur as in many other States. It would not remain suspended for ever. I entertain the hope that the States concerned will placate the advanced and awakened section of their people. And I suggest to the Jaipur Durbar that they are going the wrong way by keeping them locked up even though their satyagraha has been suspended. In any case what I must call the inhuman treatment of the prisoners, including Sheth Jamnalalji, might surely stop at once.

 CHI. CHIMANLAL,
 Such  hard   tapascharyalibtech_616_footnoteas  you   desire   to   do   is  not   to   be undertaken in haste. He who wishes to know what ahimsa is must first learn to practise the  yamaniyamaslibtech_617_footnote. That is no small matter. Do all observe them with real sincerity? How many pray? How many spin and card, or show love to their neighbours? How much love do we show each other in Segaon? We learn the lessons of ahimsa and truth from such seemingly small details. My rigidity also arises from my imperfection. That is why I have so far tolerated the laxity of co- workers.  Ponder  over  the  difficult  vows  of  yamaniyamas,  shamalibtech_618_footnote, damalibtech_619_footnote, etc., mentioned in the verse cited by you.
 
 We are shortly leaving for Brindaban.

   SPEECH AT OPENING OF VILLAGE 		INDUSTRIES EXHIBITION, BRINDABAN libtech_622_footnote  
     BROTHER 	AND SISTERS,  May 	3, 1939 
  	Very few sisters have come, of course, but let those who have come 	hear me. I have been told that a notice was sent out yesterday, in 	the name of Prajapati Babulibtech_623_footnotethough not actually by him. The notice said that 	plague had broken out here and hence there would be no meeting of 	the Gandhi Seva Sangh and no exhibition. There would also be no 	provision for water, and even if there was, people should not drink 	it. This notice was distributed by a friend here. One can only call 	him a friend, for how could he be called an enemy? This led to a 	fear that people perhaps would not turn up. They would think that 	the exhibition had been postponed. It was suggested to me that it 	might be advisable not to open the exhibition today but to postpone 	it till tomorrow. I said the exhibition should be opened, even if 	only five persons turned up. At least we have arrived. As you see, 	the arrangements here have been made with a large audience in mind. 	I had only a brief look at the exhibition. I could not see it 	thoroughly. Doctors have prohibited me from making public speeches. 	Hence, I     
 shall not be able to say much. I was even advised not to come here. But, having come here after so many years, I could not resist the temptation of seeing you and speaking to you. It is now many years since I first came to champaran. Many of you were not even born at the time. Then also I had emphasized the point that you must put your spare time to some use. In those days we had selected the loom. We had no knowledge of the spinning-wheel then. We did not know how to spin. Chhotelallibtech_624_footnotelibtech_625_footnote, the man through whom this work was started, was summoned from Kochrab. He was a very industrious man. He did whatever work was entrusted to him. But even for him the task was difficult. Poor Chhotelal is no more and his work has  remained undone. But though his work remained incomplete, it brought good results. The atmosphere in those days was one of despair. People were frightfully lazy. And the people of Champaran were inclined to be lazy, too. They would sit round me and harass me. I would tell them that they should learn some industry. And so Chhotelal was called. But who would listen to poor Chhotelal? Chhotelal is dead, but his work remains to be done. I am reviving for you Chhotelal’s sacred memory.
 That is why I am inviting you all to see the exhibition. It is not a very big exhibition. I have not come out of it particularly inspired. But it is a useful thing for Champaran. Let the people of Champaran have an idea of the things that are being made. For instance, the use of innocent leather. I call that leather innocent which does not involve slaughtering of cattle. After the cattle are dead, they are split open and their bones, their flesh, their hide, everything is utilized. A  bhumiharlibtech_626_footnoteBrahmin is carrying on this work. I was very happy to see that, when nobody knew how to make string-gut, this man had made even that and made it well. I even saw in the exhibition a tool for making taklis. It is a small tool. It is not a big thing. He makes six or seven taklis in a day and just manages to live. He may be making four annas a day. Perhaps he is satisfied with that much. But how can I be satisfied? I would like to give one anna for an hour’s work. But how to provide work for all?They would have work when all of you think honestly and start wearing khadi and realize that you have to serve Daridranarayana.   But this place is now flooded with textiles from  the
 
 vide “A Slient Co-Workers Gone”, 1-9-1937
 mills of  Japan, England and Ahmedabad. You buy that cloth thinking it is cheap, while you find the khadi prepared by the   poor expensive. I can then only say that you do not deserve to live in India. You call the things made by the rich cheap. My economics does not accept this. If you realize this, You must know where your duty lies. My economics consists in buying the things made by the poor people at a higher price.
 There are a number of such things in the exhibition. There is paper from Nepal, the like of which you will find nowhere else in India, or in the world. No other hand-made paper can compare with it. It is like silk. It is worth seeing. You can use it for air-mail if you wish.
 There is yet another thing. You can have a drink there. It is called nira. There are millions of palm-trees in Bihar. This is a juice extracted from those trees. It can be converted into liquor also. But nira is not liquor. I have a Brahmin boy living with me. He has devoted his whole life to it. It has no alcoholic content at all. Liquor can be made from almost anything. It can be made from grape juice. It can also be got from steeping rice and fermenting it. We can make gur from nira which tastes like honey. It is better than the gur made from sugar-cane. The sugar-cane gur is too sweet. This is much better. You can make crores of rupees worth of such gur. Cane sugar is a bad thing. It is not fit to eat. Gur is good. It provides salts. Gur is never harmful for the system. Sugar is. I recommend that you should go and see how gur is made from nira. People say that palm-gur is intoxicating. This is a wrong impression. I suggest you should definitely taste it. Doctors have recommended that I should take gur. I take this same gur every day. But I am never tired of it. Sugar-cane juice is very sweet. This is not so sweet. Nature has seen to it that it cannot be processed in a factory. It is prepared in Andhra Pradesh where palmyra trees grow in thousands. There are millions of these trees in Bihar, and that gur could be prepared here as well. We can completely eradicate our poverty through it. This is the only remedy for our poverty.
 You can see the exhibition by paying the entrance fee of one anna. There is another thing worth seeing. They extract oil there. There are many such things that can be produced in villages. If we revived all those things, we would not become affluent but we would be able to get rid of our poverty. Today we do not have enough to eat. Women do not have enough clothes to wear. These things would
 then be available. We would not get silver and gold and money. But silver, gold and money are worth nothing compared to this wealth. The nation which can produce things like these possesses real wealth. Such a nation alone is truly prosperous. If you visit this exhibition you will realize all this. Now that I have said this much, please take it that I have opened the exhibition.

   SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETING, 		BRINDABANlibtech_627_footnote  
 
 May 3, 1939
 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
 You have just heard Kishorelalbhai. I do not intend to comment today on the topics he has covered in his speech. Nor do I intend doing so later. I would like to dwell briefly on the four or five questions that were placed before me last evening. But even before I proceed to do this perhaps if I recapitulate here what I have written about Rajkot it will help to clarify my position today. I would like to draw your attention to a point on which Kishorelal has dwelt in the course of his speech. He has said that if we are truly non-violent, the heart of the person who considers himself our enemy will, in the face of our non-violence, gradually melt. It is in the very nature of non- violence to rush into the jaws of violence. And it is the nature of violence to rush forward to devour anything that comes its way. Non- violent people cannot practise non-violence among themselves, because they are all non-violent. The test for a non-violent person comes when he has to face a violent person. I have assumed all this from the beginning and I have been conducting various experiments in non-violence in my own life. But I cannot say that I have always been successful—successful in the sense of melting the heart of the opponent. I even doubt if I have been able to carry on these experiments exactly in accordance with my idea of non-violence. the
 
 realization that I had not been able to reach the point I had intended came to me with added force in Rajkot.
 I repeatedly asked myself the question why we had failed to melt Durbar Virawala’s heart. The simple answer I got was that in our dealings with him we had not been wholly non-violent. Even those who considered themselves satyagrah is abused Virawala. I have myself been saying things. I could not control the tongues of all. I have no doubt been trying to control my own tongue. But I could not control the tongues of my colleagues. Many satyagrahis do not even realize that in giving tongue to such things we violate non-violence. It is my laxity that I have ignored this. Take the Ali Brothers  for instance. Their tongues were sharp. I knew them intimately. Even today I can certify that there was time when they never held back anything from me. When we were touring in connection with the Khilafat they used to tell me frankly whatever they had in their hearts. Even if they had some terrible thought they would express it to me. I still cherish many such sweet memories of them. Subsequently their opinion of my non-violence and my love for Muslims changed considerably. The bitter experiences of the later times have not diminished the sweetness of our earlier relations. They created considerable bitterness among Muslims with regard to truth and non- violence. But I have forgotten all those things. There were other collea-gues too who similarly used harsh words. They said what they liked of opponents.
 In short, I have not been as firm in this matter as I should have been. So long as our people did not go beyond words I paid no attention to what they said. I remained indifferent to violence in  speech. Later this became a habit and I even stopped taking notice of it.
 I suddenly saw a new light when I proposed to Mr. Gibson at Rajkot that the Thakore Saheb should form a Committee of his own choice. Even Mr. Gibson admitted that I had made a sporting offer. Whatever I had been doing prior to that was self-evident in my life. In trying to accomplish my purpose I even showed the British Government there duty. I pointed out that it was its duty to protect its subjects. That was the reason why I wired to the Viceroy. I did not beg for anything from the British Government. I just made them do their duty. But one great flaw in this was that I brought Government pressure to bear on the Thakore Saheb, or say, Durbar Virawala. The
 feeling came to me again and again that the experiment I was conducting was fraught with risks. So I went to Mr. Gibson and told him that the Thakore Saheb should form his own Committee. This was a new thing for me and for the country. I acquired a new tool and a new method. It was like changing my house.
 But even today I am not prepared to tear up the Gwyer Award. I wish to make use of it. Such is my weakness. But what am I to do? I can only follow the dictates of my heart. But, if I can summon the strength to obey the dictates of non-violence, I would tear to bits or burn the Award. I should have reassured Virawala. I should have told him: ‘See, I have torn up the Gwyer Award. I shall have nothing to do with the British Government. If I have to resort to satyagraha now it will be against you. And the experiment will be my sincere effort. What would it matter even if I had to die in my attempt to convert the Rajkot authorities? As yet I have not been able to persuade myself that  I do not want British help in the Rajkot matter. But this thing  is boiling inside me. Now Rajkot is for me the wonderful laboratory of pure non-violence. My reason prompts me to conduct my experiment in total non-violence in that very place. Let the world say I am mad. Let people mock at me for throwing away a thing I had got with such great difficulty. My reason says that is what I should do. The heart is still not ready. This is my weakness. This means that there is still something lacking in our non-violence. That is why our experiment in Rajkot was not pure and did not succeed. The blame does not entirely lie with Virawala. Let us see what he can do when we offer pure non- violence, I cannot conduct such an experiment in pure non-violence, just sitting here in Champaran. I shall have to turn Rajkot into my laboratory. But right now my heart does not prompt me to do such a thing. This is a sign of my weakness. There is no doubt that we are making some mistake somewhere in the matter of Rajkot. We must have the courage to correct that mistake.
 What applies to Rajkot applies also to the Congress. There are dissensions in the congress, and for these too we are responsible. Those who call themselves Gandhians are not less so. I say to you once again that you should not call yourselves Gandhians. It is meaningless label. Call yourselves votaries of non-violence. Gandhi is worthless—imperfect, a mixture of good and bad, strength and weakness, power and impotence. Let your claim therefore be that you pursue truth, are votaries of truth, you pursue non-violence,  are  votaries of non-violence. That claim is sufficient. The term
 ‘Gandhian’ is meaningless. Non-violence does not contain any such mixture. If you search your hearts from the point of view of non- violence, you would realize that the responsibility of the rift within the Congress lies with us and none else. Can you truthfully say that you have followed non-violence within the Congress? Did you bare your chests to the arrows of your opponents? Did you not try to turn and shoot them in this direction and that? Did we welcome criticism from others? No. We challenged it with our tongues. We were pleased when other people criticized the critics. All this is a sign of violence. You can say that so far I had not set such a harsh test. My words, too, occasionally tend to be harsh. But the fault lies with me, not with non- violence. You can also say that you have never claimed to have followed non-violence to this extent. But this too is the fault of my method of working. I have been somewhat lax in this regard. Let us acknowledge these faults as our own and not ascribe them to non- violence. Let us not bring non-violence to ridicule for faults which are ours. Let us look upon the faults of our colleagues in the Congress as bits of straw or as dust particles and get on with them; let us see our own faults a mountains. Even if others consider us their opponents, let us not consider them so. We are as much full of violence as they are.  It is the nature of a serpent to hiss. But we have taken a pledge of non-violence. We wish to conquer that propensity of ours. We assert that we shall protect, not devour, the Princes. We even talk  of converting them. But I am afraid that we talk of converting them. But I am afraid that we talk of converting them because it has become a fashion to do so. Deep in our hearts we do not believe in it. This is a sign of violence in us. Truly speaking we do not have the slightest hope that the Princes will ever be converted. We feel the same about our colleagues in the Congress. I must frankly tell you that this is a sign of violence, and it is precisely because of this that there is so much dissension in the Congress.
 This is what I am constantly thinking and that is why I am trying out new technique with Durbar Virawala. Please believe me when I say that I am not going to run away like a coward from the Rajkot problem. I am not going to let down my co-workers thus. Nothing so perverse will happen. If I do any such thing, you can take it that I have lost my reason. I have certainly grown old. But there is not as yet any evidence of mental decay. I am doing my work with great care. In the last resort we are going to fight. But we shall have to change our strategy. We shall have to revise the logistics of our forces. So I am
 
 working to strengthen the position of our co-workers in Rajkot. I have dwelt on this point at some length so that you may understand it.
 I shall now say few things about the Sangh. From what I have said you will understand the way my mind is working. I have a feeling that we shall have to retrace our steps  a little. I had saidlibtech_628_footnotelibtech_629_footnoteat Hudli that we must expand our field a little, that we should also take part in politics. But, even if we have plunged into politics, we must practise non-violence in that field too. We must be very firm in this. Don’t mind if on that account only twenty members are left in place of today’s two hundred. I also find that the Sangh too is not free from the faults which are in the Congress. The Congress is a  big organization, the Sangh is small. The evils that are found in the Congress in a larger measure are to be found in the Sangh in a smaller measure. There are mutual jealousies, quarrels and also conceit. I do not see people working with one heart, one mind. I am not saying this from personal experience. I do not even know all the members. I do not recognize all the faces. I do not know the names of many. I do not know where each of them comes from and what work he is doing. I am saying this on the strength of the material I have received. It is a pity that Jamnalalji is not present here today. He is connected with a number of institutions. He keeps on telling me about his difficulties. Why do we have to face so many difficulties in running institutions? Why do all these faults creep in? If two hundred individuals could work with one mind, one heart, we could, without mentioning any particular worker, call any one of them and tell him, ‘Go to Travancore and achieve success in the work there’. But Kishorelal today does not have the courage to say this. He has to consider the qualifications, temperament and inclination of each individual worker.
 I am not saying all this to find fault with you. This speaks of the shortcomings of all of us. It seems to me that we shall have to give thought to this matter. We shall have to be more firm in the principles and in observing the rules of our institution. If this leads  to  a  depletion in our membership, it cannot be helped. I have already stated that the strength of satyagrahis lies not in numbers but in the spirit, in other words, in God.
 Hence it is that I expect every satyagrahi to have a living faith in God. A satyagrahi possesses no other strength. One can derive
 
 strength from God only if one has boundless faith in Him. How can one ever offer satyagraha without such faith in God? Anyone who says that he has no such faith in God should leave the Sangh and forget about satyagraha. I would like to ask how many of you have a living faith in the spinning-wheel. About the spinning-wheel, I have said boldly and unashamedly that it is the infallible means to swaraj. It is a unique symbol of non-violence. You may become a great expert with the spinning-wheel, but your working at it would be futile if you did not regard it as a symbol of non-violence. If we have a living faith in the spinning-wheel we shall find in it immeasurable strength. I regard the spinning-wheel as a greater symbol of non-violence than civil disobedience. In civil disobedience there is a possibility of jealousy and violence. But the spinning-wheel is  faultless.  Some people may make fun of it. The spinning-wheel can evoke ridicule but never violence. Even those who ply the spinning-wheel and ply it with diligence and faith do not regard it as a symbol of non-violence. Those who have entered politics do not regard it as a symbol of non- violence. They ply it as a ritual. I have been lax in this respect too. Now I am paying the price. I had expressed my faith in the spinning- wheel way back in 1920. Now 1940 is approaching. I repeat on the strength of my experience of twenty years that there is nothing so effective as the charkha for demonstrating the power of non-violence and winning swaraj. Today I have acquired knowledge also along with faith. This combination of faith and reason has strengthened my conviction. I stand by whatever I have written so far on the subject of the spinning-wheel. I would once again tell those who want to be satyagrahis but have no faith in the spinning-wheel that they should forget about satyagraha.
 Prajapati Misra said that spinning-wheels are being plied in five villages. This is just a mockery. Why  is  not the  spinning-wheel plying in every home in Champaran? I can make fun of the spinning-wheels plying in five villages, and if I so choose, I can also make you cry. There is nothing very exciting even in the exhibition here. Poor Laxmi Babu and Mathuradas are doing some spade work. But how is that going to satisfy me? Bihar has so many wonderful workers. Why is the charkha not plying in every house in Champaran? When they realize that the spinning-wheel is a thing that can give them extraordinary strength, the whole face of Bihar will be transformed. But the few workers that are there are not enough. There are thousands of women plying the charkha today—women to whom I
 
 cannot pay a wage of eight annas. They do it for their bread. I do not speak of those who do it for a living. I speak of those who will ply the spinning-wheel, considering it a symbol of non-violence. The spinning-wheel will transform the life of the individual who becomes a votary of non-violence and truth. He will render an account of his every minute. He will consider it sinful to waste time. God alone is witness to one’s thoughts. But such a man will have no useless thought in his mind. His speech will have a unique quality and everything pertaining to him will have a divinity about it.
 The spinning-wheel possesses all this power. But it is not self- evident. Outwardly the spinning-wheel is a lifeless object. It acquires power from determination. Let us look at it with devotion. What is there in clay? But if a devotee shapes a lump of it into a ball and decides that Lord Shankara is residing in it, that same lump of clay can become a Kamadhenulibtech_630_footnotelibtech_631_footnote. What is there in mere clay? Another man would just throw it away. Shankara does not reside in the clay. It is the faith that is Shankara. What is in Ramanama? What is the secret of the power it possesses today? Millions of people have uttered the name of Rama with great faith. It is the power or their devotion. Thousands of people are in the habit of repeating Ramanama. They  derive  no benefit out of it, because they have no devotion in their hearts. In Kaliyuga. even Ramanama can deceive. But the spinning-wheel can never deceive. It will at least produce yarn. I have got hundreds of people who would stand witness to the fact that even physical desire loses its edge if one sits down to spin with determination. Prabhashanker Pattani is dead. He was not a man who could have ever deceived me. He had written to me that when he sat with the spinning- wheel at night, he forgot all mundane affairs. The miracle of the spinning-wheel was revealed to him. It is another matter if he could not stick to it for good.
It was necessary to say this much in praise of the spinning-wheel
 because it is the most important among all the weapons that  we  possess. Let all of you make a resolution. That is why so much emphasis is laid on it. That is the reason why it has  become  so essential for the satyagraha of my conception. I wrote Hind Swaraj in 1909libtech_632_footnotelibtech_633_footnote. Its language may be   crude  but  even  today  my  pen  is  not prepared to polish it. I had not seen even a single spinning-wheel at
 
 
 the time. Not only this, I had even confused a loom with a spinning- wheel. That was exactly why I had mentioned the loom rather than the spinning-wheel in that book. But I have continued to have faith in the spinning-wheel right from those days. It has been for me a symbol of non-violence from that time on. Today I have this much strength that  I can tell those who do not share this belief to quit. If those people from Travancore or Mysore or Jaipur tell me that they do not believe in such a thing, I would tell them that I cannot carry  on  the  satyagraha with their help. They may offer satyagraha on their own responsibility, but I cannot help them.
 Thus, I have presented this thing to you in a new form. Each one of us has come here to perform a yajna for five or six days, to purify his thoughts, and subject himself to rigorous introspection. He will tell himself that judging by the language, he gave way to anger, showed malice towards this or that person, betrayed the Sangh. Many of those who realize their errors will voluntarily remove themselves and serve the Sangh from outside, even as I am serving the Congress from outside. I claim to serve the Congress more than I did when I was a four-anna member. I have absolutely no doubt about it.  Similarly let some people serve the Sangh from outside. Let those who choose to remain inside constantly examine their thoughts. All of us are probably aware that some people have got into the Sangh who have proved to be conceited and corrupt. We certainly cannot claim that everybody who has got into the Sangh has got a stamp of purity. I do hope some members of this kind will go out of their own accord. They will be serving better from outside.
 Let me now come to the circularlibtech_634_footnote.  I  do  not  wish  to  find  fault with it. Whatever has happened has happened. Let the members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh be in the Congress. Let Sardar, Rajendra Babu, etc., be in the Congress. Let other members support them. It is their business. But the Gandhi Seva Sangh as an institution should not get involved in this. This is not within the purview of the Sangh. If the members of the Gan-dhi Seva Sangh feel called upon to interfere in
 
 political matters let them do so on their own responsibility. But even here it can only mean their carrying out the tenets of truth and non- violence. We shall no doubt face defeat if we do not remain within the limits of truth and non-violence. We cannot be party to all the things that are permissible there, because, being members of the Sangh, we become trustees of truth and non-violence. We can certainly allow those members to function who enter politics carrying with them the yardstick of truth and non-violence. But the function of the Gandhi Seva Sangh is altogether different. The Sangh is not concerned with what happened at Tripuri or who voted in whose favour. That is not our field. That is the field of Sardar, or those who went to Tripuri.
 So much for the circular. Let me now come to the corruption within the Congress. The best remedy for the corruption is first for us to become pure. Let us make the atmosphere as clean as we can through our personal contact, because the Congress too wants to attain independence with truth and non-violence. The Congress too is a non- violent orga-nization and, if I can have my way, I would lay down strict conditions for it. But the Gandhi Seva Sangh is not opposed to the job of purifying the Congress. From one point of view the burden of our heads is light and also heavy. Those of us who wish to shoulder the burden of purifying the Congress may well do so. But that burden does not fall on everybody. On the other hand, our responsibility is very heavy because we have made ourselves the self-appointed trustees of non-violence. Thirteen of our members are on the Congress Working Committee. They will look after the task of purifying the Congress. If they do not, they will be proved worthless.
 I shall now take up the question of the spread of Gandhian thought. Gandhian thought can hardly spread through books. Indeed it will be propagated best through being lived. Truth and non-violence are propagated in this manner. If we place a million books on one side and a living example on the other, the value of the example will be grater. Books are lifeless. I do not suggest that we should write no books at all. We may write books and also publish newspapers if we wish. But I want to suggest that they are not a necessary means for us. Intellectual growth of a satyagrahi depends on his following his principles. We go on repeating ‘ahimsa’, ‘ahimsa’ with our tongues but do nothing to sharpen our intelligence. We have become  somewhat lethargic. The Gita says that there should be unity between mind and heart. When the mind and the heart are untied, we become unconquerable. The mind acquires the powers to solve all question.
 We do not become non-violent simply because we do not hit anyone. We indulge in violence through our thought and reasoning. This is not a sign of a sharp intellect. Keeping ourselves alert is an
 indication of sharp intelligence. When we are faced by an opponent, we should understand his viewpoint. Let us see what Jayprakash there is saying. There is an ocean of difference beween him and me. But non-violence means that we must have the patience to listen to the opponent. This is the characteristic of non-violence. This is what is meant by rushing into the mouth of the enemy.  A  non-violent person tells his opponent not to trouble himself too much for he is going to him on his own. It does not mean that we should become soft. We must keep our intelligence sharp. If we can, we should reply to the arguments of our opponent. We should try to understand his agruments from his point of view, and accept whatever may be acceptable. if I try to understand the point of view of my opponent, it does not mean that I have accepted everything he has said, or that I have flattered him. If we train our mind thus, we can continue to propagate truth and non-violence all through our life. This cannot be done through a monthly or bi-monthly or quarterly. My co-workers will tell you how carelessly young India used to be brouhgt out by me. young India did serve a useful purpose. In the end it just died, but satyagraha did not die. My work did not stop where Young India ceased publication. A satyagrahi knows that he cannot depend on external aids. Rather, He depends on inner strength. He who has faith in God will go ahead with faith in himself.
 It has also been asked what we should do in the face of considerable opposition to Gandhian thought and the needlesss poisoning of the minds in Maharashtra. I have already answered this question. We should purify ourselves. If things are going wrong in Maharashtra, let us kill Shankarrao Deo. If things are going wrong in Karnataka, let us kill Gangadharrao. Do you agree, Shankarrao, Gangadharrao?libtech_635_footnoteWhat  more can I say in this matter?
 I have been asked my opinion of the Aryasamaj satyagraha. After much testing I must tell you what I feel about it. What is going on in Hyderabad in the name of satyagraha is not dharma. Nor is it being conducted for the defence of dharma. There is much fraud in it. No one who believes in truth and non-violence can participate in it.  I have got enough evidence. I have passed it on to Guptaji. The poor man had come to me. He is very much upset.

N. 1550      SPEECH AT TEACHERS’ TRAINING CAMP, 			BRINDABANlibtech_643_footnote    May 	4, 1939  	I should like to tell you what I saw today. First I visited the 	exhibition.libtech_644_footnoteIt 	is very good. They say in size it is one-fourth of the Tripuri 	exhibition. The one-fourth that I saw pleased me immensely. It does 	not mean that my happiness would have been four time as much if I 	had seen the whole exhibition. In the Tripuri exhibition, the major 	contribution was from the Jamia Millia of Delhi, while here they 	have contributed nothing. Their contribution was indeed very large. 	I was able to visit the exhibition today only for a few minutes. It 	is certainly very large. If I had a whole day I would have seen the 	whole of it and could have gained much. I would have seen to what 	point      
 they have taken basic education, how much they have succeeded in planning education through a craft and how they correlate the craft with other subjects.
 I would like you to study this exhibition. Observe everything very carefully. Let me give you only one example. We did not know that a carding-bow made from munj grass can be so efficient. It is so good that in some respects it is even better than the bow made of catgut. For fine carding it is excellent. Every fibre of the cotton is separated. Besides it is not harmful to health. Even a person like me whose heart has become weak can comfortably card his cotton with it. It is also nice to look at. No effort is required in plying it. One derives only pleasure. This is just an example to show what progress we can make in such small things. It is the invention of someone who has devoted all his mind and inventive genius to it.
 I should like you to study and assess the exhibition from this point of view. There is no limit to the progress we can make. We are not good teachers if we are not able to develop originality in us through this kind of education. Education through a craft is the pivot of basic education. You must cultivate your creative instinct to be able to develop your mind through various crafts and teach innumerable things by putting your creative genius and resourcefulness to use and discover new things.
 Today we are dependent on only two crafts. Let us take these. We have found two men who could develop their minds through these crafts. That is why Ashadevi and Aryanayakam could carry on their work. We found Vinoba for the takli. And we have found another gentleman to show us how one can develop one’s mind through cardboard-making. These two men showed us how full of possibilities the two crafts are. If you cannot do as they did you will never develop creative instinct. If such men were not there neither Zakir Saheb nor Ashadevi could have achieved anything. I would like you to see the exhibition with a view to developing creative  instinct  through this system of education. It is not our aim to teach industry and handicraft in the traditional way. We want to make crafts a living medium of education.
 I then went to the school. I found the teacher quite intelligent. All the boys were plying taklis. I claim that I know the science of the takli, the charkha and the loom very well. Although I lack skill in working them, I know much about them. I immediately noticed that
 
 there was something wrong somewhere. Either the teacher himself did not know how to spin on the takli or the boys were taught wrong. I detected the flaw immediately. The boys were taking four times as long over an operation that should take half a minute. They kept on twisting the takli. when they drew the thread. That is not the right method of drawing yarn. The yarn should get the twist as we draw it. There is no need to give any further twist. The yarn instead of becoming strong becomes useless if it is twisted even just a little more than necessary. And also one can never increase one’s speed.
 I also noticed a few more shortcomings which I do not mention here. I have told Nayakamji that a teacher who is not doing well in his craft should be considered useless, however intelligent he may be. However much he may have read of the science of the charkha and the loom, he is not fit to be a teacher if he cannot spin well. He cannot even become a clerk. He is utterly useless. It is our claim that the mind can be developed through a craft and that is our yardstick. That is the central point of our scheme.
 I will therefore first see the quality of the teacher’s yarn— whether it is even or not, whether it is strong or not. If it has these qualities I will say that he is a good artisan but if his proficiency in the craft does not help him to develop his intellect, he will not have originality. He will go on plying the charkha and the loom for generations and never make any improvements. That has been the history of India. That is so because there was no correlation between the hand and the mind. Artisans never paid any attention to the improvement of their tools and methods of work and those who did mental work were not concerned with the crafts. So both lost their creative instinct.
 I will test the intelligence of the teachers also from this point of view. They should learn their craft in this way and take pleasure in it. The scheme will come to naught if teachers do not train themselves in this manner. If it gets known that the scheme has failed in this manner, the people will laugh at them. However, that is not what I am afraid of. I will be satisfied only when I see that things are happening as I had wished. If they are not, then even if the whole world praises us for our work I will not be deceived. I am feeling apprehensive although the basic education scheme is much admired  today.  The  teachers working under the scheme are feeling Jubilant. But maybe we are deceiving ourselves. I should like you to learn the art of gaining
 knowledge through a craft. That art and knowledge is a rare thing. You must utilize your knowledge of B. A. and M. A. degrees to this end. It should be your duty to make education, which is a dull and drab affair today, a lively and fascinating subject. It is my claim that by the method I have suggested a rare enlightenment will be produced.
 To me intellectual education and bookish education are not the same thing. In my opinion a man whose intellect is not correlated with his hands is not intelligent. Would you call a man an authority on the Vedas if he has memorized words from the Vedas and has learnt by heart its commentaries? What I would ask is how far he has assimilated the real meaning of the Vedas. His conduct will be an indication. I have set before you the main idea behind this scheme.

Courtesy: Pyarelal      ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS AT GANDHI SEVA 			SANGH MEETING, BRINDABAN–I    May 	5, 1939  	Here are some questions received from Annada Babu. He says he is 	asking the questions not for himself but for others.  QUESTION: 	Your statementlibtech_645_footnoteafter Subhas Babu’s 	election  has 	 somewhat changed 	the situation. 	Why did you not issue 	any statement 	at the 	time of 	the election? 	Some people are 	of the 	view that the 	present situation 	would not 	have arisen if you had issued a statement at the time of the election. ANSWER: 	It is true that I did not issue any statement. According to  	Annada Babu that has changed the situation. What he means is that 	the    
 situation would not have taken the turn it did if I had issued  a  statement earlier. But the statement issued by Sardar Vallabhbhai and others contained a small sentence which suggested that I too was connected with it. Moreover, there was no particular occasion then. I saw no need to issue a statement at the time. It became necessary subsequently. It is a long story. I shall not go into it. It was not a question of my having been sluggish. Nor was there any mistake in explaining the situation to the country. I had conveyed to Subhas Babu what I felt. That is the way I work. In the end all that remains is for me to put up with any misunderstanding that may have arisen. If there are any more questions from anyone on the point they will be welcome.
 Some people are under the impression that you were not in favour of the Pant resolution. What was your reaction when you first knew about the resolution? Why did you write to Subhas Babu that the more you thought of it the more you disliked it? Kindly explain.
First of all, you are all aware  that I was confined to bed at the
 time. It is not my way to interfere in something with which I am not concerned. That is why I remained indifferent to the developments at Tripuri. So much so that I even avoided reading the newspapers in those days. My mind was preoccupied with Rajkot. Someone reported to me that Pantji intended to move some such resolution. I understood at the time that the resolution would express confidence in the old Working Committee. I stated that while expression of confidence was all right I would have done something more if I was there. I had said even at Wardha that if they had the courage they should bring a motion of no-confidence against Subhas Babu. It would have been a straightforward thing to do. If the delegates to the Congress felt that they had made a mistake in electing Subhas Babu, this was the only civilized way open to them. But probably the atmosphere was not quite favourable then. I had a feeling that Subhas Babu would form his own Working Committee. But that did not happen. Then it was that the Pant resolution came up. All I heard was that the resolution expressed confidence in the people who had gone out. I said if that was all there was in the resolution it was all right. But I had nothing to do with it. I saw the resolution later. Then followed an exchange of letters with Subhas Babu. The letter to which Annada Babu has referred is not before you. When I read the Pant resolution, I found that it contained a suggestion that Subhas Babu should be guided by me. I  thoroughly disapproved of the idea. So much so that I  refused
 to do anything of the kind. I stuck to my refusal to the end. It is possible that this may lead to some misunderstanding. I shall have to put up with it. How can I do a thing which I consider wrong? I told him that he should form a Working Committee of his  choice, formulate a programme and implement it. I would clear the atmosphere if I could. If not, the work would go on and gradually we would be able to change the atmosphere. That is why when at Calcutta  I was asked to name the Working Committee I found the idea repugnant. There I had some material, in view of which I felt it would be wrong to do so. Nobody had such material at Tripuri. Subsequent exchange of letters further confirmed me in my opinion. Later on I also came to know about the ill-feeling generated. How could I announce any names under those conditions? It would be subjecting Subhas Babu to coercion. Can the ship of the nation sail smoothly if I subject Subhas Babu to coercion? It would be like sinking it. I said I would not do it. I also said that if they wanted  to  have  the  old members of the Working Committee back, they should consult among themselves and if they were agreeable both sides could work together. But I would not be party to imposing any names on Subhas Babu. The more I think about that resolution, the more I dislike it. I cannot serve the nation according to the terms of that resolution. However much anyone may insist, I just cannot choose names for the Working Committee. My doing so would be coercion against Subhas Babu. And coercion is violence. How can I resort to it? I have told you of my feelings as to the Pant resolution. Even if people think that I have served the country well it surely does not give me the right to use coercion against anybody !
 What was the difficulty in giving the names when Subhas Babu himself had agreed to accept any names you suggested?
What the question means  is  that   through  the   Pant  resolution
 Tripuri ordered me to do a certain thing and ordered Subhas Babu to do a certain thing. Subhas Babu was willing to do as ordered, then why did I defy it? Where was the question of coercion in giving the names for the Working Committee in pursuance of that order? Seemingly the argument is attractive. But it is fallacious. Supposing somebody were to come to me tomorrow and say that I had been ordered to abuse him and hit him as I please? When there was such a gulf between me and Subhas Babu, would it have been civilized behaviour to inflict some names on him merely by virtue of that  right? Having a right surely does not mean that I should exercise that
 right in utter disregard of my sense of proportion. If someone were to behave with me thus I would not like it. Supposing tomorrow I am given the right to abuse everybody, would it then become my duty to exercise that right? There is a distincion between right and duty. The exercise of right depends on one’s sense of duty. It is my duty to follow dharma. I do not think only of my own importance. It is of no consequence to me. I think in terms of the nation. I  do  what  I consider my duty.
 Cannot your correspondence with Subhas Babu be published? If not, will you please explain why?
At one stage it had been decided to publish the correspondence.
 Later on, after Jawaharlal’s arrival it was decided to withhold the publication. It was also decided that I should not issue any statement. It would not be in the interest of the nation. In this my attitude was that Subhas Babu should do only what suited him. This should be our only attitude if we are non-violent. It is none of our concern to publish any correspondence. We should withhold the publication as long as we can. It becomes our duty to publish the correspondence only when someone does something contrary to what he has written in a letter. There is no such question here. That is why I have left it to Subhas Babu. If any misunderstanding arises from the correspon- dence not being published, it will not bring any particular harm. The other person will publish it when he thinks it is necessary to do so. When it becomes ancient history, it will be abandoned.
 Let me now come to Shankar Rao’s two questions. I shall take up the second question first because it is related to the same topic.
 You have mentioned in one of the letters to Subhas Babu that there are fundamental differences between you and him. What are those differences ?
It  would be  better for me  not to mention the correspondence
 between us. That would make the explanation too long. I shall explain the thing briefly. I think he still holds the view he had expressed at Jalpaiguri. I saw that I could not associate myself with any part of it. It includes giving an ultimatum to the Government. He holds that we possess enough resources for a fight. I am totally opposed to his views. Today we possess no resources for a fight. Today the whole atmosphere is so steeped in violence that I cannot think of fighting. How did the violent incidents take place at Ranpur in Orissa and Ramdurg in Karnataka? Pantji could not control things at Kanpur. We have no control at all over the Shias and Sunnis in Lucknow. There is
 no limit to communal strife. We cannot carry on by controlling just a handful of Congressmen. It had ever been our boast that the whole country was with us. Today we are not able to control more than a handful of people. Workers and peasants too were supposed to be entirely with the Congress. We do not have the same hold among the peasants of Bihar as we used to. Is this a situation favourable for starting a struggle? There is a difference between the work of the congress and that of the people who believe in violence. If today I am asked to start the ‘Dandi March’, I have not the courage to do so. How can we do anything without the workers and peasants? The country belongs only to them. I am not equipped to issue  an ultimatum to the Government. The country would only be exposed to ridicule. But Subhas Babu thinks that we are ready for the struggle. This is a great and fundamental difference of opinion. We differ in our ideas of the resources needed for the struggle. My conception of satyagraha is not his. Is this difference of opinion not fundamental? I cannot give out all these things to the Press right now, because it would not do any good. I shall write about it when the time comes. So much for the fundamental differences. It has been covered in our letters also. I have put the matter to you simply. It has nothing to do with personal differences.
 The same is true of the corruption in the Congress. There the difference between me and him is one of degree. He also agrees that there is corruption. But he feels that it is not of such proportion as to cause worry. But in my view, we shall not be able to do anything so long as this corruption persists. For me there is no difference between civil disobedience and office-acceptance. Both are part of the satyagraha movement. Thus my point of view and assessment of the situation are altogether different from his. He does not mean the same thing by satyagraha as I do. Hence, sometimes even the difference of degree becomes a fundamental difference. I have become  so  impatient of the corruption prevailing in the Congress that I should not hesitate to bury the organization if the corruption cannot be removed. In a non-violent organization there can be no place for some of the things that pass in a violent organization. The example of a violent war cannot apply here. Now you will have understood what I mean by fundamental differences.
 Are not your differences with the socialists and Jawaharlalji also fundamental?
 Would you take up a similar attitude with regard to them?
 No. My differences with the socialists are of a different kind. Do not confuse the two. They differ with Subhas Babu on the question of giving an ultimatum to the Government. I do not know who exactly sup-ports him on the point. That is why in spite of my having sharp and even fundamental differences with the socialists my attitude towards them is different. Moreover, we cannot put the socialists and Jawaharlal in the same category. Jawaharlal does not lend his name to any socialist group. He believes in socialism. He mixes with the socialists and consults them. But there is considerable difference between their methods of work. The differences between me and the socialists are widely known. I believe in change of heart and in working for it. They do not. They make fun of the spinning-wheel. But even so the socialists are coming nearer to me every day. Or, you may say that I am moving nearer to them. Or, that we are moving nearer to each other. I cannot say how long it will continue. It is quite likely that one day our ways will part. The same thing happened with Subhas Babu. The Jalpaiguri resolution brought our differences to the fore. There are certainly differences between Jawaharlal and me. But they are not significant. Without him I feel myself a cripple. He also feels more or less the same way. Our hearts are one. This intimate relationship between us has not started with politics. It is very much older and deeper. We shall leave it at that.
I shall come now to Gangadharrao’s question.
 The socialists say that while you are tolerant and liberal, we others are intolerant and narrow-minded. For instance you might be prepared to take them on the Working Committee but we would not agree to it. What is the reason for this?
How can I say? How can I answer that? You should search your
 own hearts for the reason. I can only say that in this matter you must follow me. You must be as gentle of speech as I am. The socialists come to me frowning, but they leave smiling. This does not mean that  I do not express to them my differences with them. I tell them frankly what is in my heart. I do not flatter them, but try to enter their hearts. I have faith in their honesty. I try to understand their point of view. I find time to talk to them. You should treat them with the same courtesy. I can go so far to help you.
 Now one more question remains. But it is very important. Other things are of only passing importance. You are all in Gandhi Seva Sangh. I have read its constitution. It contains many things. You believe in certain principles. If the question Annada raised had been
 raised on the Congress platform it would have  been  a  different matter. But when it is raised on the Sangh platform I feel a little grieved. Why should you entertain such doubts? The differences between me and Subhas Babu are of a passing nature. But if this leads to bad blood between us, the country will be ruined.
 Differences of opinion should never lead to bitterness. You are all believers in religious tolerance. I would suggest that you must broaden the definition of religious tolerance. We must also include in it the moderates and the radicals. We must see equality between the moderates and the radicals. We should have respect even for those who call themselves radicals. We must look at the views of the radicals from their angle and those of the moderates from theirs. We should see our dharma with our eyes and those of others with theirs. This is religious tolerance. This means that we must emphasize the points on which there is agreement between us. We should not stress the points of difference. Just because I respect Islam and Christianity I do not become a Muslim or a Christian. What I mean to say is that I respect these religions as much as I respect my own religion. But I would not be converted to either Islam or Christianity. What is the sense in my reading the Koran or the Bible, if I remain intolerant? This is not the correct meaning of the expression ‘religious tolerance’. In politics too let us take our differences in the same light. Let us regard the socialists too in the same way. If we take this attitude our differences would be only temporary and we would try to end the quarrels as far as possible. If we do not do so, we shall become narrow minded. We shall get entangled in small quarrels. Man shapes himself after the dharma he follows. If we forget larger issues and remember only the small points which cause differences, the country will be completely ruined.
 Why is it so difficult to discover the points of agreement? The royal road of non-violence consists of mutual trust and willingness to understand another’s point of view with an unprejudiced mind. In this connection I take up once again the matter of that circularlibtech_646_footnote. I have read it again. The central point in it is the same. The central point is the Sardar. Many people have a feeling that the Sardar does not work properly. Deep down in their hearts they feel that he has been unfair in the cases of Nariman, Khare and Subhas. But they should frankly
 
 express themselves. This is the inviolable dharma of the votaries of ahimsa. This is our dharma in relation to the whole world. If we feel distrust or anger for anybody, it is our duty to go straight to that person and understand his point of view. We should remember two statements from the Bible. In the matter of morality the word of the Bible or any other scripture should be considered as authentic as that of the Vedas. One of these statements is: “Agree with thine adversary quickly”libtech_647_footnotelibtech_648_footnoteand the other statement  is: “Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath”libtech_649_footnotelibtech_650_footnote. To me these utterances are as precious as anything in the Vedas. This is the very root of ahimsa. Indeed ahimsa has to rush into the mouth of himsa. If you feel that the Sardar has been unfair to Subhas Babu, unfair to Nariman and unfair to Khare, let me say that the blame for the Khare affair and the Nariman affair lies with me. I am not saying this to protect the Sardar. I am making a statement of fact. But  it is now irrelevant. I call myself a seeker of truth, a speaker to truth and a satyagrahi. I  will  not therefore deliberately give support to those reso-rting to injustice. But  if you have anything against the Sardar in your hearts, you should go and speak to him. If you are not satisfied with his explanation or if there is still something rankling in your heart, it becomes your duty to relieve the Sardar from the Sangh. Thereby he would not cease to belong to the Gandhi Seva Sangh. I freed myself from the Congress and continued to serve the Congress. Your relieving the Sardar from the Sangh would not mean that you have become his enemies or he has become your enemy.
 What I say of the Sardar I say of everyone. We have Appa Patwardhan here. He is a great mathematician. With the help of mathematics he can explain the mechanism of the charkha in great detail. He has faith in the charkha, he believes in khadi and ahimsa. But supposing he begins to have doubts, he loses confidence in the honesty of the members, must he then continue in the Sangh? Must he necessarily cease to serve like other members of the Sangh simply because he is no longer a member? Or because he cannot  be  a member of the Sangh, does it mean that he is worse than the rest of us? But when there is mutual distrust there cannot be any Sangh. Only so long as we honestly believe that no one belonging to the Sangh can deliberately act improperly will our path be easy. As soon as a doubt
 
 arises in our heart we must seek mutual explanations. I do not wish to suggest that those who thus suspect the Sardar are bad while  the  Sardar is good. I would never utter such a thing. I have merely indicated the way. The Sardar himself has been saying that if there are any suspicions concerning him he would not like to remain in the Sangh. You may be aware that a few days ago there was a heated exchange of words between the Sardar and Jamnalalji. Jamnalalji said he would leave the Sangh. The Sardar said Jamnalalji had created the Sangh. Why should he leave? Rather, he himself would leave. Then both of them wanted to be relieved assuring they would continue to work for the Sangh. But neither of them left because at heart they had nothing against each other. Whatever misunderstanding was there, was cleared. There was no question of bad blood. Similarly the Sardar is seeking to be relieved today. If there is even the slightest suspicion concerning him in our hearts we must drive it out. If a large number of people have suspicions about him he must go out.
 But there should not be a single person who has distrust about any member. These things do not seem very important so long as they are limited in extent. But if they become widespread the Sangh will be destroyed. Then the conclusion to be drawn will be that in the present age no organization of satyagrahis and votaries of ahimsa can be formed. But it is my claim that it is very easy to organize those who believe in truth. Im my life I have made special attempts to make a collective dharma of truth and non-violence. But if distrust becomes widespread in our organization, if, even at the end of fifty years, I have to confess that the believers in truth and non-violence cannot be brought together as an organization; then I shall declare it—confess it shamelessly—and say that after fifty years I have come to the conclusion that the unique idea I had developed in my life cannot be worked through an organization, that it is not capable of being organized. Then the Sangh will have to be discontinued. But today I have hope in my heart. I consider it my supreme dharma to see truth and non-violence organized .
Now I come to Deo’s first question. It is the principal question.
 In what way are the constructive programme and non-violence closely related? kindly explain.
If   the constructive programme is  not closely related to non-
 violence, what else can be? Hindu-Muslim unity, removal of untouc- hability, prohibition and the fourth is charkha. The relation of the first
 
 three items with non-violence is very clear. How can any-one who believes in non-violence regard anybody as untouchable even for a mo-ment? How can he allow his mind to degenerate by  taking alcohol? How can he have feelings of hostility against the Muslims or any other religious group? There cannot be any mass satyagraha unless all this is taken for granted. This is true for me and for Subhas Babu. Even Subhas Babu cannot start a satyagraha unless these conditions are fulfilled.
 Now for the charkha. To me the charkha is the symbol of non- violence. As I have already said, its basis is dedication. The same is true of Ramanama. Ramanama has no independent power. It is not a quinine pill, which has a power of its own. One may or may not trust that power. It is as effective when A has malaria as when B has it. It destroys mal-aria germs wherever they may be. Ramanama has no such independent power. A mantra acquires power through dedication. Gayatri is a mantra for me. I have willed moksha through it. For a Muslim his kalma is the mantra. There is a great difference in a Muslim reading kalma and my doing so. When a Muslim reads kalma he becomes a different man, because he has willed his moksha through it.
 The Charkha has no independent power that will give you swaraj. But if I am resolved that I shall learn the lessons of non- violence through charkha and secure swaraj through it, it becomes for me a tangible means for attaining swaraj. The place that Gandhi Seva Sangh has given to the charkha is not merely to provide a little money to the poor. What is the economic necessity of having mass spinning for half an hour? And where is the need for silence? After all, how much are you going to spin in half an hour? The nation resolved in 1920 to attain swaraj through non-violent means. We have filled the charkha with the power of that resolve. Since then this process has been continuing. Impelled by that resolve we ply the charkha here. The charkha is thus a symbol of the resolve of all of us—Hindu and Muslim, rich and poor, young and old. What closer relation can I point out? So long as every house does not have a charkha, so long as there is not total prohibition, so long as there is no Hindu-Muslim unity and complete removal of untouchability we cannot have the mass satyagraha which Subhas Babu wants and which I also want. Till then we cannot be fit for civil disobedience.
The right of civil disobedience will come only when we have
 learnt willingly to obey the laws we ourselves have created. Today I do not feel like telling Deo to go and offer satyagraha at Kolhapur, or telling Ramachandran and Radhakrishna to start satyagraha in Travancore and Jaipur. Two months ago I was willing to give them the permission. Things which did not appear to me ugly two months ago appear ugly to me now. That was why I had given permission to Jamnalalji. But certain things to me have assumed today a greater importance and greater value.
 I discovered these things in the laboratory of Rajkot. The great strength I acquired through that experiment brought very happy consequences. I can make you laugh by describing things that happened at Rajkot. I am drinking deep the elixir of the strength I acquired at Rajkot. I am beginning to gain control over the atmosphere. My task is becoming easier. I cannot get work out of many people, because I have become more strict. But what does it matter if I can only find five persons at Rajkot? I shall complete the work with their help. If there are five persons, I can start my campaign only with them. I had said in 1920 that we could start the work even if there was only one true satyagrahi available, and we would definitely be victorious. Probably Vallabhbhai will testify to this. It is my endeavour to become such satyagrahi.
 When the question of the Rowlatt Act arose I said that there was a way out, but that I could not all by myself do anything. For I was an imperfect satyagrahi. I might be able to do something if some people joined me. Then Shankerlal came, Horniman, Sarojini, Jamnadas Dwarkadas and Umar Sobhani—the poor man is dead now—all came. I got support from all these people. It was such a conglomeration— but it awakened India and added to my strength. I want warmth and help from everyone. In trying to get co-operation from all and organizing them I increase my own strength. My power of introspection is increasing. I am a very selfish person. I do  not  merely watch you when I give you time. I place much value on my time. If I feel that by giving you time I would not be bringing some benefit to myself I would not be doing any such suicidal thing. I give you time because I find that I stand to gain something by doing so. It is of no  consequence to me whether you gain something or not. What  I am concerned with is whether I gain anything. I see if I am not heading for a downfall. I do not give you time in order to entice you. I only increase my strength. And my strength has increased that way.  I have reached the age of seventy years. But my powers have not
 
 dimmed. I realize my responsibility. I would keep my vow, whatever it may be. What does it matter if I am left alone? I did the same thing in the Transvaal. I had taken a vowthat I would give a fight to the Tran- svaal Government even if I was the only one to do so and win. The concept of satyagraha was not even born yet. Millions of people can thus be organized by a mere act of will. I have countless proofs of this. What happened when we decided to have the hartallibtech_651_footnoteon April 6? We had not organized anything. But people fasted and responded to the call of hartal throughout the length and breadth of the country. That was the beginning of swaraj for the country. That task was accomplished by sheer determination. But because of lack of training in constructive work it could not be continued. So long as you do not value the constructive programme and are not convinced that civil disobedience cannot be carried on without it, you will ever be disappointed. The constructive programme may take time but there is no other way.
 We cannot make satyagraha complete without the constructive programme. An atmosphere of non-violence cannot be created without it. This is the only way of my working. That is why when Surendra went to Gujarat I told him that if nobody wanted his services, if nobody came to him he should think of the charkha and spin for all the twenty-four hours. If we did it with a resolute mind that alone would be an act of service. I have absolutely no doubt about it. My conviction is becoming stronger and stronger day by day.

 ON THE TRAIN,
 May 6, 1939
 CHI. MATHURADAS,
 I have received your two letters. Who told you about the cabinet? I have not even heard the mention of Pu. ’slibtech_652_footnotename in that connection. When the thing itself is not there, why talk about it? I have not understood the purport of the second letter. I do not even know what Pu. has done. Can you not have such things cleared up with V.libtech_653_footnote? He will be knowing everything. You should understand that in public life and in democratic functioning everyone has the experiences that you have had. We must be made of sterner stuff.
 I gather from Mahadev that you are not keeping good health. It seems you are also having blood-pressure. In that case, you must take rest. What has happened to Taramati?
 Blessings from

   ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS AT GANDHI SEVA 		SANGH MEETING, BRINDABAN–II  
 May 6, 1939
 I have here some slips which the President has passed on to me. One of them is from Appasaheb Patwardhan. I shall first deal with his question .
 QUESTION: In what way can the members try to put into practice the principle of a living wage?libtech_654_footnote
°ANSWER:   There  is  no  harm  in   adopting  any   means   which is
 morally proper. One individual may take to carpentry for a living. He can earn Rs. 15 from this work. Or, he can take to  carding  or  tailoring. A  member of the  Gandhi Seva Sangh would choose only
 
 those occupations which are available to thousands of people earning their livelihood by doing manual work. But he will not work merely to earn his livelihood. He is aware of the hardships people have to undergo while earning their livelihood. But as far as he himself is concerned, as he earns his livelihood he also renders some service. Apart from these occupations, members can also supplement their income through teaching. Anyone who requires more and who also has Appa’s knowledge of  mathematics can even become a professorlibtech_655_footnote
 . But these are exceptions as far as I am concerned. I would always prefer manual work for a livelihood.
 I am either unable to understand your theory of trusteeship or my reason cannot grasp it. Will you kindly explain it ?
 It is the same thing whether you are unable to understand it or your reason does not accept it. How can I explain such an important principle in a few minutes? Still I shall try to explain it in brief. Just imagine that I have a crore of rupees in my possession. I can either squander the amount in dissipation or take up the attitude that the money does not belong to me, that I do not own it, that it is a bequest, that it has been put in my possession by God and that only so much of it is mine as is enough for my requirements. My requirements also should be like those of the millions. My requirements cannot be greater because I happen to be theson of a rich man. I cannot spend the money on my pleasures. The man who takes for himself only enough to satisfy the needs customary in his society and spends the rest for social service becomes a trustee.
 Ever since the idea of socialism became popular in India, we have been confronted with the question as to what our attitude should be towards the Princes and millionaires. The socialists say that the Princes and the millionaires should be done away with, that all must become workers. They advocate confiscation of the properties of all these people and say that they should be given the same wages as everyone else—from Rs. 5 to eight annas a day or Rs. 15 a month. So much for what the socialists say. We too assert that the rich are not the owners of their wealth whereas the labourer is the owner of his labour. He is, therefore. from our point of view, richer than the rich. A zamindar can be recognized as the owner of one, two or ten bighas of land. That is to say, of as much as may be necessary for his livelihood.
 
 We also want that his wages should not be higher than those of the labourer, that he should maintain himself on eight annas a day and use the rest of his wealth for the welfare of society. But we would not take away his property by force. This is the most important point. We also wish that the Princes and the millionaires too should do manual work and maintain themselves on eight annas a day, considering the rest of their property as national trust.
 At this point it may be asked as to how many trustees of this type one can really find. As a matter of fact, such a question should not arise at all. It is not directly related to our theory. There may be just one such trustee or there may be none at all. Why should we worry about it? We should have the faith that we can, without violence or with so little violence that it can hardly be called violence, create such a feeling among the rich. We should act in that faith. That is sufficient for us. We should demonstrate through our endeavour that we can end economic disparity with the help of non-violence. Only those who have no faith in non-violence can ask how many trustees of this kind can be found.
 You may say that such a thing can never happen. You may consider it as something not in keeping with human nature. But I cannot believe that you are not able to understand it or that your reason cannot grasp it.
 I fully endorse your view about varnadharma. But putting it into practice is a really complicated matter. Will you please elucidate ?
Today castes have become mongrelized. Varnas have  disapp-
 eared. In such a situation how should those believing in the varnas proceed? This is what this question implies. Today there is only one varna. Call it the Shudra varna. We cannot say Atishudra since we do not believe in untouchability. We do not believe in a fifth varna. Hence only the fourth varna, that is, Shudra is left. Let all of us consider that we are Shudras. Then there will be no feeling of high or low left. Envy and discrimination will automatically disappear. This is the only thing that would be fitting in the prevailing atmoshpere. Brahmins are a rarity these days. Who possesses learning which is unique and will make for the welfare of the world? And where is the man who will expect nothing for that learning? As for the Kshatriyas there are none left in India. If there had been any, the country would not have lost its freedom. India would not remain in her present condition if great learning and great valour could be found here. So
 far as the Vaishyas are concerned, Vaishyadharma is a varnadharma. It is not merely an occupation to earn money. It is a duty, not a right. They should use their wealth for the benefit of society. Many of the occupations which the Banias follow are immoral. Earning too much money is also immoral. Many of these occupations cannot  be included in varnadharama. This means that today even the Vaishyas are not there. Only some money-grubbing professional people are left. Three varnas have thus passed out. That leaves us the Shudras. They possess no learning. They consider themselves slaves. They do not serve with knowledge. That is to say, there are not really even Shudras left in India. In other words, we cannot say that even one of the four varnas is still extant. Even so, since we believe in varnadharma, let us accept the dharma of service. Let us adopt Shudradharma. This does not mean that we should discard learning. We should acquire as much learning as we should. We should acquire as much valour, that is, fearlessness as we can. We must develop commerce and industries to the greatest possible extent. If we do all these things out of a sense of service and devotion, true Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas may be born amongst us. Then there would be no feeling of high or low among them. If we do something like this something may happen in future. When such varnadharma prevails, all the bickerings that go on in the name of communism, socialism, Congressism, Gandhism, casteism, etc., would be over. Now there are a few questions from Balubhai.
 When shri Thakar and I started village uplift work, Gandhiji had laid down an important condition, that the people of the area we want to serve should furnish us free accommodation as a proof of their desire for our service. Now, I would go further and lay down the condition that we should go only to those villages where people are eager for village reforms and, when the time comes, the village leaders are prepared to  do physical work and spend money from their own pockets. Where the village leaders are not co-operative, no improvement is possible—no matter how long the village workers stay there. I would like to know how far this opinion of mine is valid.
There are many other social workers like Balubhai and Thakar
 in Maharashtra. They were very optimistic when they first  started work. But now they say that however much they work,  so  much poison has spread there that persons wearing Gandhi caps are looked upon with contempt. Even the services of the people wearing Gandhi caps are forsaken. It is possible to feel disheartened under these circumstances. Many years ago Balubhai and Thakar had come to consult me before starting their work. I had suggested to them that
 one test of whether or not the villagers were keen about their services would be that they should at least provide the material for building a hut. Now Balubhai feels that this condition is not enough. He suggests that some more conditions should be laid down. But  I  am  not prepared to go beyond this. This condition does not lay down a limit. If the village people also give us food, why should there be any objection from my side? I have only suggested  the  minimun condition we should lay down. And we must consider it  the  maximum. There is no need to go beyond this.
 The same thing happened to me at Sevagaon. I asked the people in the village whether I should shift to their village. Land was provided by Jamnalalji. Our people are very courteous. They talked to me very respectfully. But they said whatever they had to say. An old man came to me and said: “You can come to Sevagaon. You will be doing us an honour. But we shall not allow the untouchables to enter the temples. You should not expect any such thing from us.” Despite this I went there and have stayed there. If the people fulfil our one condition and give us some place to stay we should not feel disheartened.
 How long can poison last? The newspapers say all sorts of things about the Gandhians, about me and about the Sardar. If we are as they represent us, then they are right in saying what they do. We must then confess everything. Why should they accept our services if we are really that bad? They would not accept even medicine from our hands. They would be having a lurking fear that we might give them poison along with the medicine. If there is an unworthy motive in our giving them medicine, they can refuse to have it saying they would rather die. If someone comes to serve me but harbours a secret wish to kill me in the end I would not trust such a man and tell him so. If people really have such suspicions about us, we must remove them by dedicated service. We must create confidence among the people that our intention is only to serve, and we mean no harm to them. If we turn back in disappointment in the face of their protests, then we are not giving them even a chance to test our bona fide. The test for us would be only when we persist in our work. If we stick on even when they have burnt down our hut, then the wrong impression about us will be removed. They will relent when they see that we are not perturbed even when they burn our hut, beat us, abuse us or stop our water.
The newspapers are publishing all sorts of things about us; but
 why should we feel ashamed? Yes, we should feel ashamed of whatever truth there may be in those reports, and should try to rid ourselves of the blemishes. If we are not as evil as they paint us, why should we be bothered? And, why should we be afraid of confessing to anything evil that may be in us?  If the  Vividhavrittalibtech_656_footnotelibtech_657_footnotereports that a particular person is a drunkard or this or that, whatever truth there may be in the report should be admitted. The person concerned should acknowledge that he does take a stealthy drink at night, and occasionally indulges in sensuous pleasures. If we admit our faults and know that they exist, there is a chance of our correcting ourselves.We must tell the people that we have certain faults in us, and would gradually overcome them. Escaping from a situation can never be part of our code of behaviour. That is not the way a satyagrahi can follow his duty. If our faith is complete, there is no reason to despair.
 Now you may ask what you should do about a livelihood while you are staying in the villages. Appa had asked the same question. You should do manual work. You can sweep the approaches to the village or do some other things, and maintain yourself on the few pice you may earn. If you get foodgrains in lieu of money, you should manage with that. You may not always get money from the Gandhi Seva Sangh. What does it matter if your body is ruined? One who has determination will face any hardships that may come his way and this will bring him hope out of despair.
The next question is from Achyut Deshpande.
 When a small clan in a Princely State claiming the right of conquest or kinship with the ruler not only opposes the people’s fight for justice but helps the ruler in crushing such a movement, even violently attacking those who participate in the movement, the people come to have the same attitude towards it as towards the ruler. Is this not natural? What can one do to heal the breach thus caused between two sections of the population? Would it not be practicable for a time to ignore this problem? Is it wrong to think that the problem would be more easily solved through being ignored?
I  have not been able to understand this question fully. But  the
 answer to what little I have understood has been furnished in the discussion we have been having for the past two or three days. This precisely is the reason why I have suspended the campaign in the States and why I   do  not  have  the   courage  to   start  a  countrywide
 
 
 movement. Where there is a danger of ill will or violence being generated it is our duty not to start any agitation. For it will not last. It will create misunderstandings. People will stray into erroneous paths. It will not be enough for us ourselves to be non-violent.
 Take an example. I stay at Segaon. Suppose there is a snake there. I will have to remove that snake from there and confine it to a place where people will not feel endangered by it. Or, suppose there is an outbreak of the plague somewhere. I go there to help. For myself I depend on the protection of God. But should I, for that matter, go to the people without bathing or washing myself? There is the risk of people catching the contagion. My non-violent duty consists in my going to others only after washing myself. Then suppose smallpox breaks out in a village. A few among us do not believe in vaccination and so do not get themselves vaccinated. Still they want to serve the people. We are convinced that vaccination has failed. But it would not be proper to be carriers of the disease among the people whom we want to serve. Hence our non-violent duty lies in either getting ourselves vaccinated or quitting the place. The lesser dharma of not getting ourselves vaccinated disappears in front of this paramount dharma. I was asked to give my view about the legislation concerning vaccination in Bombay and Madras. I told Dr. Varki that those who did not believe in vaccination should either leave the area or get themselves vaccinated. This is ahimsa. In a way it is easy, in another way it is not so easy.
 Take another example. We have planted a small orchard at Sabarmati. Monkeys come and pillage it. People feed these monkeys. So they stay on there. You go to Mathura and Brindaban. There are so many monkeys around that people cannot live in peace. But in the adjoining cantonment area there is not a single monkey. It is not ahimsa dharma thus to feed the monkeys. It is unjust to other people. The same is true of our campaigns. Not only our opponents, but also our supporters are full of violence. Other people want to destroy swaraj altogether. This means that there is no real co-operation from the people. If we launch a movement for swaraj they want to attack us. If we insist on continuing satyagraha under such conditions we would be postponing swaraj. The answer to the question is clear, Our small groups of five or ten members should give up the idea of satyagraha. We shall never be destroyed because we are ready to be destroyed. But their opposition will die out. Those who oppose swaraj want to destroy the poor. So they lose nothing if we continue our movement in an
 
 atmosphere of violence, whereas the poor would be completely ruined. We are prepared to be ruined ourselves but we do not wish the poor to be ruined.
 I am conducting the same experiment in Rajkot. That is why I say that Rajkot has become my laboratory. I have suspended the satyagraha there—or rather the civil disobedience. The word satyagraha is not appropriate here. Today I have suspended civil disobedience every- where and I am concentrating on constructive programme, because it does not involve this kind of risk.
 Bapu, part of my question still remains unanswered. You have just explained that today, when there is so much violence in the air, there is a danger of communal and other disturbances. Those who are in the movement may very well face beatings and suffer hardships, but those who are not prepared for it should not be made to do so. Hence civil disobedience should be suspended and we should concentrate on constructive programme. All this is clear; but even while engaging ourselves in the constructive programme, it is necessary to increase our strength and teach non- violence to the people who want to join the movement. Now, suppose we want to hold a meeting or take out a procession. Now this meeting or procession is harmless, and there is no question even of violent words. Even then a section of the people (such as Garasias in Rajkot, some Maharashtrians in Baroda, some Muslims in Hyderabad) under the impression that we are not loyal to the Government and want to harm that section loses its temper, abuses us and assaults us. Thus our movement arouses anger in them and a wall rises between them and the supporters of the movement. Under such circumstances, because there already is a lot of misunderstanding, our attempts to arrive at a compromise or establishing closer contacts with them will be like pouring oil over the flames.
 Under these circumstances, am I correct in saying that instead of forming Hindu-Muslim or Garasia and non-Garasia unity committees, and thus making vain efforts at unity, it would be better and more practicable for us to keep off the whole thing ?
Yes, that is correct.
 This question has been asked by Moolchand Agarwal. He has been putting questions to me over a long period of time.
 There is no awakening among people on account of child-marriages, funeral feasts, purdah and untouchability. But some people believe that we must concentrate only on political work, for social-reform activities serve no purpose. They say that social reforms will automatically follow once political rights are realized. Will you kindly explain the place of social reforms in the work of nation-building ?
This is a much-delayed question. It should have been asked in
 1920. In my view there is no special political field which is not related to social reform. They are both interrelated. If we do not earnestly go about the work of social reform, no political reforms are possible. I would, therefore, give the first place to the work of social reform and only the second place to purely political work, If there is such a thing.  I took help from the sanatanists, whether for Gujarat Vidyapith or for the khadi work. But when they said that I should abandon my work for the removal of untouchability I told them that I would rather do without their help. The Mulji Jetha Market promised Rs. 35,000, but on some such condition. I told them that they could  keep their money, I would do without it; but as for  the  removal  of untouchability, I wanted it immediately. Till today I have not received the Rs. 35,000 from them. But the work for swaraj did not stop. It is dangerous to allow such things to find a place in our hearts. Let us not allow even such notions as ‘social’ and ‘political’ any place in our thinking. Let us not hinder national progress.
 It is true some sense of discretion will have to be shown. It would not be proper to go and resort to satyagraha when someone in our community calls people for dinner. It is enough if we avoid going to that feast ourselves. There are so many areas of social-reform activity that can go on side by side with political work. There too we shall stick to non-violence. But satyagraha is a mighty weapon. It cannot be used everywhere. Its use has to be limited.
Now, There is a question from Mahavir Prasad Poddar.
 Should a person who has not been able to convince his family or neighbours about sharing food with the Harijans be a member of the Gandhi Seva Sangh?
So long as he has not set right the behaviour of his family
 members towards the Harijans or has not been able to do so he  cannot be a member of Gandhi Seva Sangh. Till such time as he has not settled the quarrel at home, he should serve from outside. Must he then go on quarrelling with the members of his family and his wife? Should he beat his wife and turn her out of the house? Certainly not. Let him not accept untouchability for himself. He should patiently put up with the protests of his family. He should win them over through non-violence. For him, his house itself becomes a laboratory. He cannot come to Gandhi Seva Sangh till he has won over his wife through love.
 RADJALROSJMA NAKA: Should the path of satyagraha be considered closed to those who do not honestly believe that only persons with faith in God should join
 
 satyagraha, or to those who are socialists or atheists ?
 I am sorry, but I shall have to say, ‘Yes’. God alone is the strength for a satyagrahi. He wants to walk on his own legs. He does not want a stick for support. He does not depend on any strength from outside. Faith in God is an inner strength. Hence the path of satyagraha is closed to those who do not accept this. They must take the path of unarmed protest. They can even be non-co-operators. But they can never be satyagrahis. Because anyone who does not believe in God will be defeated in the end. Should I then admit that there can be no victory through non-violence? On the contrary, I would say that with non-violence there never can be any defeat. Faith in God is itself the power behind non-violence. Hence we must put up with it even if somebody feels hurt. But it should be made absolutely clear that this path is not meant for the people who do not believe in God. There is no other way. The socialists who do not understand my point of view would say that I have worked out a trick for getting rid of them. I cannot help it. I shall face even that charge. You may say that this will keep out many gallant co-workers while hypocrites professing faith in God but without any evidence of it in their practical life will get in. But I am not talking about hypocrites. I am rather talking of those people who are ready to sacrifice their all in the name of God.
 Instead of asking me such a question you should have asked me why I had been sleeping for the last twenty years. You should have asked me why I have taken so long to wake up. I would plead guilty to such a charge. I would only say that after all I am not a perfect satyagrahi descended from heaven. I have not come with a ready- made technique of satyagraha. Nor have I brought any book from heaven to which I can refer and tell everything in advance. I am with you in the midst of society. I place before you any new thing which I may happen to discover through my experiments with and my experience of satyagraha.
 KRIPALANI: Does this mean that the non-believers like the Jains and Buddhists cannot join the satyagraha movement?
If there are some Jains or Buddhists who do not believe in the
 atman they cannot join satyagraha. But these people do believe in the atman. And those who believe in the atman believe in God. Their quarrel is only with a particular idea of God. I do not want any disputation over it. A certain Jain even asked me at Rajkot. I gave the same reply. He then remembered that the Jains too believed in Divine
 Power. Anyone who accepts the existence of a Power that helps us in all situations is not a non-believer. He is a believer in God. What does it matter if he is a Jain or a Buddhist? But if some Jains  and  Buddhists themselves say that they cannot join satyagraha because they do not believe in God I shall not argue with them. I shall say that they are right.
 KRISHNAN NAIR: What is the criterion for judging whether a person does or does not believe in God? If an individual accepts God as a metaphysical probability but not as a mysterious Power, will he be called an atheist ?
 This is a subtle question. It is not even necessary to go so deep
 into it. I do not insist that everybody should have the same idea of God as I have and describe Him in the same vocabulary that I use. There is no ready-made test to determine whether somebody does or does not believe in God. Still, it is possible to test it. But this point will be settled tomorrow,libtech_658_footnotelibtech_659_footnotesince today my time is over.

   TALK TO RURAL  RECONSTRUCTION WORKERSlibtech_660_footnote  
 May  6, 1939
 It is a tragedy that many of you should be coming from cities or should be accustomed to life in the cities. Not unless you switch your minds off the cities to the villages can you serve them. You must realize that it is not cities that make India, but the villages, and that you cannot reconstruct them unless you revive the village life with its defunct handicrafts. Industrialization cannot bring life  to  the moribund villages. The peasant in his cottage home can be revived only when he gets back his craft and depends for his necessaries on the village and not on the cities as he is compelled to do today. If you do not grasp this basic principle, all the time that you give to rural reconstruction work will be wasted.libtech_661_footnotelibtech_662_footnoteBuild your villages anew. Infuse new blood in villages which are in the grip of ruin. Save the teeming
 
 millions who need your assis-tance.
 There is one thing more that I would ask you to bear in mind. Whoever wants to qualify himself for the service of the village must go about with his mind and his eyes pure and must look upon every woman as his mother or sister.

   IS NIRA OBJECTIONABLE ?  
 Among the fourteen points that Parsi friends have raised against the prohibition campaign, there occurs this strange passage :
 Mahatamaji persuades the Parsis to drink nira.  (sweet,  unfermented toddy), but the Parsis very well know the properties of nira. Moreover the British Government had already tried this nira- drinking experiment free of tree-tax, but it failed because nira produces cold, flatulence, diarrhoea, etc. The experiment was already tried in Mahatmaji’s Ashram at Segaon and there fatal results were pronounced.
I do not know what the Bombay Government tried. But I do
 know what nira is doing and has done to those who are trying it. It is wholly wrong to say that the experiment at Segaon Ashram failed and that it produced fatal results. It has never been known to have produced any of the bad results ascribed to it by the writer. On the contrary nira is still being freely drunk by many in Segaon and that with profit to their health. Moreover it is turned into syrup or gur, and in that condition I and many others use it almost daily. As gur it is sold in large quantities. It is better relished than sugar-cane  gur because of its being less sweet. As to the deaths that occurred in Wardha, not in Segaon, the investigations have clearly showed that the deaths were due not to nira- drinking but to cholera. Nothing has been shown to establish any connection between the deaths and nira. Supposing the patients had developed cholera without drinking nira, would it have been right to say that cholera was induced by the ordinary food that they had eaten? I may mention that several people had taken in Segaon with impunity the same nira that had been taken in Wardha.
 If the thirteen other points are based on as weak a foundation as this (No. 13) is, surely there is no case against prohibition. And I make bold to say that the rest are no stronger. I have picked out the thirteenth in the hope that my personal testimony may put the
 opponents on their guard againt making statements they cannot substantiate. Opposition based on reason must always command respect. This one seems to me to lack that essential quality.

   ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS AT GANDHI SEVA 		SANGH MEETING, BRINDABAN–III  
 May 7, 1939
 Let me begin with Radhakrishna’s question which I took up yesterdaylibtech_665_footnotelibtech_666_footnotebut could not finish. The question about God had been more or less dealt with. A discussion on it was going on.  Shri  Krishnan Nair had raised a subtle point. But it does not allow much scope for discussion. I am indifferent about the names or attributes which a man may apply to God. I had made a general statement that any man who had no faith in God could not stay a satyagrahi to the end. What I had meant was that so long as the satyagrahi is not convinced that there is some great subtle Power that would give him strength in all situations, he cannot face tyranny, strife and  humiliations and sustain his non-violence. These days we  do  not suffer anything which may be described as torture. Nobody places us on burning coals or pierces us with needles. This would  be  the extreme form of cruelty. But in the face of even such torture not to have any malice against the torturer is non-violence. Man cannot show such supreme non-violence in the face of such suffering relying on his own efforts. So long as he does not have  faith  in  some Power and feel the presence of that Power behind him he will not have the strength calmly to put up with such tyranny. This Power that thus sustains is God. Not to bear any malice towards the tyrant even on such occasions is another name of faith in God.
 
 QUESTION: Can those persons who habitually wear khadi but do not spin nor feel inclined to spin join the satyagraha movement ?
ANSWEER : No. Those people cannot be chosen for civil
 disobedience. Listen carefully. I am talking about civil disobedience, not satyagraha. Satyagraha is a universal term. Civil disobedience requires special preparation. Satyagraha includes even constructive programme. Those who do not spin can be satyagrahis, but  they cannot take part in civil disobedience.
 What should we tell those who do not wear khadi but who feel for the country—lawyers who are prepared to abandon their practice, men and women who want to come forward selflessly to put up with hardships?
Millions of people cannot join civil disobedience. Civil disobe-
 dience is meant for those who have purified themselves and who have learnt to obey laws in humility. Only they can determine which law should be disobeyed and how and when. They willingly obey not only the laws of the State but of all other organizations. They do so not out of fear of punishment but deliberately out of a sense of duty. That alone gives them the right to break laws. It is like taking a dose of poison. If a man takes a dose of poison without proper knowledge about it , he dies. The more I think the more I realize that civil disobedience is no ordinary weapon. Everyone cannot  use  it. Everyone can certainly insist on truth. All those who have joined civil disobedience today are not people of this kind. Except those who are qualified for civil disobedience other people do not offer real civil disobedience. They indulge in angry, violent disobedience. Quite likely they are all good men. Maybe they are better than we are. But they do not fit into our pattern. Hence they should keep away.
 What should be the criterion of complete faith in truth and non-violence? He who has faith in truth and non-violence should wholly keep away from violence and falsehood in his daily life. Under these circumstances, can someone in whose house there is a business of foreign cloth or mill-cloth or who, in some way or the other, helps in diverting Indian money out of the country, or who is harming the interests of the country by some other act, be a satyagrahi? Should his professed faith in truth and non-violence be accepted or should further investigation be made ?
In my view no person indulging in such practices can join civil
 disobedience. Should he be kept out of civil disobedience or should he be allowed to join? I have myself been rather weak on this point. I have not exercised as much firmness as was necessary. I am facing the consequences and the country is paying for it.    Such a person cannot
 join civil disobedience. He can be of help in other ways. What is the point in investigating in the case of a person whose actions speak for themselves ?
 How should the character of a person be investigated?
 This    question   has    already  been   answered	in	the	above discussion.
 What should be considered the limit of non-addiction? Should bidi, pan and tea be regarded as addictions ?
It is a difficult question. I have drawn the line at taking of
 intoxicants. He who takes intoxicating things suffers from intellectual degeneration. How can he insist on truth? So in this matter the limit is quite clear. But I have not the heart to get rid of a man who, though he smokes, is a great devotee of God. I can take a bold stand in the matter of prohibiting the use of opium, ganja, bhang, alcohol, etc. So  I have drawn the line at these things. I am a staunch enemy of tobacco also. I do not like even tea. I feel disturbed when I see people chewing pan the whole day. But this is my personal view.
 Should one resort to fast and similar methods in jail in the face of inhuman conduct—not necessarily humiliating—such as bad food and harassment?
In this matter it is difficult to lay down any rigid rule. A
 satyagrahi is born to face all kinds of difficulties. He should not every time be thinking of honour and humiliation. He who is over-sensitive or is too delicate of body should not go to jail. As a rule, any person who joins civil disobedience should be prepared to face all kinds of difficulties in jail. He should not agree to anything which is opposed to his self-respect and integrity. Those who have delicate hearts should remain outside. Fasting normally should not be resorted to.
 Once the satyagraha is launched, newspapers are stopped. Bulletins are stopped. People joining prabhat pheris are liable to be arrested. Under these conditions do you not think that propaganda would cease if no persons except those who are permitted to be satyagrahis are allowed to join the prabhat pheris, distribute bulletins or join any other activity which may be liable to lead to the arrest of these persons?
I  do not think the adoption of such a  policy would lead to  the
 stoppage of all propaganda. So long as a few individuals go to jail, their incarceration itself would mean a lot of publicity. I believe that this is the true propaganda for civil disobedience. It does not matter much if newspapers, bulletins and prabhat pheris are stopped. I have seen that an attempt to continue   these   things  anyhow  involves  the
 danger of all types of persons being drawn into civil disobedience. The Yeravda Prison became filled with people during the satyagraha of 1931. I was able to meet a few of the detenus and freely talk to them. They told me that good people had come in the beginning. But those who came later looked like goondas. They broke jail rules, used abusive language and indulged in physical fights. The question was not what they did. The question was what they did not do. A boy may get up, distribute a bulletin and go to jail. What purpose would be served by carrying on the satyagraha with the help of such people? I find lack of faith, lack of courage behind such questions. What have we got to do with crowds of people? It is our belief that even if there  is one true satyagrahi, swaraj is bound to come. Why should we be so impatient? Swaraj may come now or later.
 Given the above conditions only very few people would be qualified to go to jail. But what about those people who cannot fulfil those conditions and yet are desirous of serving the country? What should they do?
This question has been already answered.
 What should we do when people go to prabhat pheris without informing us or do other propaganda work and get arrested?
We must keep on telling these people that they are harming the
 cause of satyagraha by their actions. What can we do if they do not heed us? Let us leave them to their fate. Some of them will go to jail. Of those some will tender apologies and come out. Others would do their terms of imprisonment. What can we do about them?
 Propaganda is a means of public awakening. How will this be possible in the absence of propaganda and demonstrations ?
If we are true and honest, true propaganda would go on even
 when we have gone to jail. Let us not worry about the propaganda that would be stopped. Propaganda is of two kinds: violent and non- violent. There is no harm if the propaganda which consists in bitter things being written and abuses being hurled against the adversary is stopped. There is no need to do any propaganda from our side in the face of violent propa-ganda against us. I am told that the newspapers are showering abuses on me and the Sardar. They abuse others as well. Should we bring out papers in order to retaliate and waste our money, effort and time in it? Should we set up an organization to explain our stand? How long can we go on answering every single thing that may be said against us? A satyagrahi cannot do such a thing.   Such   criticism   is   like   a      storm.   Storms   come   and also
 
 earthquakes. Let them come. They will go as they come. That storm is worse then a natural storm. But why should we fight against it? It has got to be faced. At the most, we may die trying to put up with it. We shall continue our work with this resolve.
 Following the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, people were permitted to collect salt for a year. The Government has recently promulgated an order that it will be possible to collect salt only within the limit of time it may fix from year to year. Till now people could carry salt on their heads anywhere they chose. Now this facility has been limited to the villages near the sea-shore, with the result that people are not in a position to benefit from this facility. What should we do under these circumstances?libtech_667_footnote
In this matter I should frankly tell you that our own people are
 responsible for this order. We have not abided by the restrictions laid down under the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. Hence these excesses. They reap what they sow. There are no such obstruction where people observe certain conditions. Such things are happening because people have started trading in salt.
 Do you believe that the philosophy of the Aryasamaj encourages violence?libtech_668_footnote
 I have never said that. What I say is that they consider the use of both violence and non-violence legitimate even as an  ordinary sanatani Hindu does. According to them, it is wrong to remain non- violent when it becomes one’s duty to resort to violence. We, on the other hand, believe in only non-violent resistance. This is  the distinction between us.
 But even you considered it a duty to have calves and dogs killed?libtech_669_footnote
 Then you should say it does not lie in my mouth to talk of non- violence. I would accept it. I shall agree. I am willing to pull my ears for it. You are familiar with the cases of the calf  and  the  dogs incident. I have already said what I had to say in the matter.
 A resolution about the Aryasamaj satyagraha in Hyderabad too was shown to me. I had given my frank opinion in the matter. I had made it clear that whatever I had said was not meant for the Press. In my view, that satyagraha is not in keeping with dharma, nor is it conducted in the spirit of dharma. Those who do not regard non- violence as the supreme dharma can go only so far with non-violence. Those who do not possess a non-violent outlook cannot offer non-
 
 violent satyagraha. I am conscious of the limitations of civil disobedience. But it would not be right for me to issue any such statements in the newspapers that may bring harm to somebody. I am  a worshipper of satyagraha. Why should I unnecessarily express my views about something with which I am not concerned? Why should I criticize everything that may be happening anywhere? This is not the way of non-violence. I do not wish to indulge in  such  irrelevant action. Of course, I do try to persuade my co-workers to give it up. What is going on today does not add to the prestige of the Aryasamaj or religion. I would appeal even to Sir Akbar Hydari that he should change his attitude. I am doing everything that the duty of a friend may demand. I am doing nothing more. The day I feel it is my duty to make a public statement, I shall do so. But the members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh should not go beyond the limits I have set.
 Then there is one last point. Prajapati Babu has done much work for this covention. But there has been much unnecessary expenditure too. This is a blot on our work. There is gas-lighting here,  even electric lighting. At this rate there will be no limit left. We must fix certain limits. On the other side arrangements about lavatories etc., are not of the best. According to my conception of the Gandhi Seva Sangh, this is not an annual celebration. This is an educational institution for us. We should never forget that we have to proceed every day in the direction of simplicity, a rural outlook, of sanitation and cleanliness. We do not come here for having a celebration or an excursion. This convention is a training camp for us. It provides us a wonderful opportunity for introspection, for exchanging notes about one another’s experiences and having training in restraint and discipline. The accommodation and sanitation here should be  so perfect that even if we have to stay here for seven months instead of seven days, we should not feel like going back. But after only six days here I feel impatient to get away. Why should this be so? I have a fear that if I do not run away from here soon the place will become more unclean. Thus we have to work very hard, for we are still far away from the ideal I have set.
 The fact that people have turned up here in such large numbers is an indication of their love. Expression of love is good up to a point. But even in this there should be some restraint which is not to be found here. This too is a matter of practice
 I do not mean to say that nothing here is deserving of praise. I appreciate good things. You have done much work, gone to much
 
 trouble. But I do not have to praise, you for it. You have not done these things in the expectation of praise have you? If you have done these things for praise, my praise by itself would be the fruit of your work. My job is to criticize. I cannot say how these shortcomings can be overcome. I can only criticize. Sanitary conditions in our conventions should be perfect. Arrangements about meals, etc., should be clean and hygienic. Please take my comments in the right spirit. Try to see that wherever this convention meets next year, these shortcomings will not be there.

   SPEECH AT ALL-INDIA VILLAGE INDUSTRIES BOARD 		MEETING, BRINDABAN  
 May 7, 1939
 If, judging from the small attendance here, you and others thought that the Village Industries Board was a failure it would not be surprising. For the annual meeting of any organization, an attendance of eighteen would be considered small. But I would not be surprised or pained even if we had to manage with less, even fewer than eighteen, or do wholly without them. This is what I feel about this Board. We must keep its constitution and organization a little strict. Too many people cannot be fitted into it. Many names were therefore omitted because the rules were not being observed. Such an organization as the Village Industries Board should be judged not by its numerical strength but by the work it does. Of course it has not done much work so far. But whatever little work has been done is done thoroughly and after a few years you will see the deep effect of that work. The office-bearers are sincere workers. I can assert that they devote their entire energy to the work.
 These days people’s eyes are fixed on the towns. So there is a slackness in the work of the Village Industries Board. It is also difficult in the present circumstances. Millions of the poor cannot subsist on the little money they can get. We want  to  give  them, through village industries, sufficient for their maintenance. We have taken up this activity with that aim.
 The office-bearers of the Village Industries Board have faith
 that the salvation of India lies in the salvation of the villages which in turn depends on the revival of village industries and not on big machinery. By effecting improvement in the old village industries we can provide crores of rupees to the hovels of the poor.
 You will find the Village Industries Board a very small organiza- tion compared to the Charkha Sanghlibtech_670_footnotelibtech_671_footnote. And  compared to the latter the work done by it is also very little. There is a reason for that. The Charkha Sangh is many years old now. The method of its working is now well established. Besides this, another reason for the successful working of the Charkha Sangh is that they are concerned with only one industry. But there are so many industries in villages. So the Village Industries Board has to be concerned with many industries. It is easier to become an expert in the work of the Charkha Sangh. In the Village Industries Board we shall require many experts. Our universities should produce experts who can scientifically bring about improvements in the village industries. Today we do not get such experts and therefore it is difficult to increase our activities. We have to find our experts among the oil-men, carpenters, etc., in the villages. They do not come from high schools and colleges. It is difficult to achieve success on a large scale as long as we do not get men entirely devoted to village industries who are at the same time intelligent ghanilibtech_672_footnoteexperts  and  paper-making  experts.  Now  I   would   like   to associate these activities with ahimsa. This activity appears to be very uninteresting. But the result is interesting if we have patience. I will be happy if those who are members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh dissociate themselves from politics and concentrate on the activities of  the Village Industries Board. You seem to be happy that the Working Committee is full of Gandhians. But I am not happy about it. That has increased our responsibility. We have become overburdened. What is there in it to be happy about? Yesterday Rajendra Babu was telling me that they were facing more difficulties and putting up with more trouble because of our men, that Gandhians quarrelled among themselves, contested elections against one another. This is hypocrisy. This is madness.
 The question before us is how we can save ourselves from this kind of thing. My answer is that there is work to do in the Charkha Sangh, in the Village Industries Board and in the Talimi Sangh.
 
 Engage yourselves whole-heartedly in that work and hypocrisy will disappear. Swaraj will come quicker through that work than through elections. We cannot win swaraj through today’s politics. We have a mountain of himsa before us. Many people today are quarrelling in the name of Gandhi. One man says ‘I want to go;’ and another man says ‘I want to go’. Such people make a laughing-stock of Gandhism. If you wish to save yourselves from such things, you should withdraw from politics. There are so many activities for you. If you engage yourselves in these activities, the progress of both will be quicker.
 In my opinion the Hindu-Muslim tension can also be removed by these activities. If village industries are revived, millions of villagers will get full wages. Here the interests of Hindus and Muslims do not clash and both the communities will be saved from conflicts that characterize politics. If the activities of the Village Industries Board are carried on in such faith, we can never give them up. We will go on working for all the twenty-four hours. That is why I told you in the beginning that though this thing appears so small and unrewarding I see nothing wrong in that. I only see good coming of it.

   SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, BRINDABANlibtech_673_footnote  
 May 7, 1939
 Just a few decades ago, I never knew what Hindustan was nor did Hindustan know what I was. I came to Champaran in 1917 with a view to redressing the grievances of the peasantry who were mere toys in the hands of the planters. I came here with my heart open and had no other instrument for the fight except the armament of truth and non- violence. Today you love me and adore me. I accept your loyalty with gratitude. But there was nothing extraordinary in me. There was sincerity and devotion in me to lift you up from the economic, social and political morass. I only wish that you could also follow the principles I follow. What I said to you in 1917 still holds good. The indigo curse was removed because you were non-violent. You have
 
 the same weapon at your disposal. The need for it greater today than in 1917.
 Do not idle away your time and do not waste the national wealth through foreign purchases. Try to increase the national  wealth  through the introduction of spinning-wheel which is the panacea for all ills.
 Have faith in yourselves. Approach the Congress Government for what you want. Strive hard. Speak nothing but the truth. Always be non-violent. Be ready for service and sacrifices. March ahead with the mantra of ahimsa.
 I am but a representative of the Daridranarayana. India is the poor and humble abode of millions, famished, hungry and illiterate. We have taken the vow to lift them up and give them food and education and bring them happy and prosperous days. Do not neglect the masses who are so many Daridranarayanas. Be ready to face privations and destitution to serve them.
 The money will be utilized for giving bread to the hungry and clothes to the naked. The money will be spent for Champaran and its neighbours. It is for the service of the Daridranarayana that the money will be spent.
 It pains me to hear the kisans resorting to violence. They fight with zamindars. If you want to abolish zamindari, it is well and good. Do so through non-violence. Why do you terrorize zamindars? Co- operate with zamindars and tell them that they were to serve the tenantry. There should be no abuse, no filth, no violence, no beating of amlas by kisans. you must learn to love  one  another.  The protection of ahimsa and its use will give you back what you have lost. Muslims and Hindus should live in amity. They must live as brothers. They must spin. They should cultivate tolerance and devotion for service and sacrifice. If this is done, independent India is not a distant possibility.libtech_674_footnote
 I think it is obvious enough  that Hindu-Muslim unity, prohibition and abolition of untouchability are impossible without non-violence. There remains only the spinning-wheel. How does it become the symbol of non-violence? As I have already explained, the essential thing is the spirit in which you regard it, the attributes you
 
 invest it with. It is not a quinine pill, which has certain inherent properties in it apart from what you think about it. The spinning- wheel has no such inherent property. Take the Gayatri Mantra . It cannot have the same effect on non-Hindus as it has on me, nor can the kalma have the same reaction on me as it has on the Muslims. Even so the spinning-wheel in itself has nothing which can teach ahimsa or bring swaraj. But you have to think it with those attributes and it is transformed. Its obvious value is the service of the poor, but that does not necessarily mean that it should be a symbol of non- violence or an indispensable condition for swaraj. But we, since 1920, connected the wheel with swaraj and non-violence.
 Then there is the programme of self-purification with which the spinning-wheel is again intimately connected. Coarse homespun signifies simplicity of life and therefore purity.
 Without the spinning-wheel, without Hindu-Muslim unity and without the abolition of untouchability there can be no civil disobedience. Civil disobedience presupposes willing  obedience  of our self-imposed rules, and without it civil disobedience would be a cruel joke. This is what came to me with redoubled conviction in the laboratory at Rajkot. If even one man fulfils all the conditions, he is capable of winning swaraj. I am still far from being that ideal satyagrahi. I said the same thing at the time we met to organize a satyagraha campaign against the Rowlatt Act. When it was started we had only a handful of men, but we built up a considerable organization out of that handful. As I am an imperfect satyagrahi I want your co-operation. In the process of organizing and seeking your co-operation. I myself grow, for my introspection never ceases. Even the time I am now giving you is as much in my own interest as in yours, or at least in my own interest, if not in yours. For as I examine myself I am growing and evolving. No one is too old to grow, certainly not I. In the Transvaal, satyagraha was born; but a few thousands wielded it there. Millions have wielded it here. Who knew that on the 6th of April 1919 millions would rise up like one man in response to the call I had made from Madras? But the constructive programme is essential for the ultimate success. Indeed today I think we should be untrue to the nation if we did not fulfil the programme of the spinning-wheel as a symbol of non-violence, no matter how long it takes.

   DISCUSSION WITH RAJENDRA PRASAD AND OTHERSlibtech_675_footnote  
 BRINDABAN,
 [On or before May 8, 1939]libtech_676_footnote
 GANDHIJI : You won’t count nearness to Patna an advantage. We want to go to the village. Is Bihar going to drag us back?
 RAJENDRA PRASAD: Time is very short, the city affords various conveniences, there would be less expenditure.
But that means that we change the policy we have been carrying
out for the last three years? Why not Brindaban itself?
 Sonepur was discussed but it is a glorified village.
 I want you in the heart of a village. Don’t emulate Haripura and Faizpur. You should excel both in simplicity and in freedom from splendour.
 Visitors are a problem, especially in Bihar where we would have lakhs of
  them.   You should make 	arrangements for them as the Aryasamajists 
  	do. They ask everyone to come with their provisions, lanterns and so 	on. They only provide them accommodation (under the trees) and 	water. For this last no water-works are necessary. Whatever you do, 	do not accept defeat and run to Patna. No need for electricity at 	all, and as we meet in winter no fans would be needed. Start work 	from 8 to 11, and then from 2 or 3 to 7. A little winter’s sun 	would be more agreeable than otherwise. No, you must try your best 	to change your decision for Phulwari. Everyone must be asked to 	bring his or her own lantern. You can say beforehand you can give so 	much and no more.  Even 	so we should have to spend a lot on construction. We must afford 	protec- tion against cold? Why 	not use your grass for warmth both above and below? There 	should be no need for cots excepting for the ill and the infirm.     
 And we won’t get money. Both zamindars and kisans are against us. Gate- money will be much less.
I do not agree. Have it somewhere but not near a city. And you
have had tube-wells here very cheaply.
 We will have tube-wells, but we have to cope with the need of nearly 60,000 gallons per hour. But electric light may be dispensed with.
I hate it. We must not think in terms of illumination. Make the
 place attractive in other ways during the day. Don’t copy what is bad. No one will blame you if you have no fireworks and no illuminations. You want cleanliness and simple wants satisfied. Give the simplest food. But I agree that you must spend on water. Collect one pice per head from each of the 70,000 villages and satisfy your needs. Then it will be a Congress worth going to or seeing. Decide on the principle of a village. I don’t mind where it may be, and you will gain strength by getting every village to contribute its mite. Volunteer corps must be enough and efficient. They must be experts in sanitation. No smell and no dirt must be allowed. Organization of this must begin early.
 The volunteer corps will cost us a good deal—probably Rs. 50,000.
 I don’t mind it, but the ultimate benefit accruing will be great. There should be no wastage in training. We may forget uniforms, etc., which go to waste, but the body of youth for our service is for all time an asset of no mean value. Therefore don’t stint in water and volunteers.
 Even the simple huts put up here have cost a lot.
 I hear so. But there must have been some mismanagement somewhere if it has become so expensive.
 Our problem is of rain which generally comes then. Patna would have been convenient from that point of view. We could shift into pukka buildings in case of need.
There is no escape from it now. Manage somehow. Don’t give
 hot water, don’t give fruit, don’t give any delicacies. Give me the contract for fruit. If anyone comes to me for it, I shall ask him to return to Bombay.

   LETTER TO LORD LINLITHGOW  
 ON THE  WAY TO BENARES,
 May 9, 1939
 DEAR LORD LINLITHGOW,
 I purposely restrained myself from troubling you whilst you were touring and taking part-holiday.
 Many   thanks   for   your   prompt   replylibtech_688_footnotelibtech_689_footnoteabout   Talcher.   The condition there defies analysis. One day hope rises high and then it is dashed to pieces. It is not now the Raja’s plighted word, it is that of the represe-ntative of the Paramount Power that is being weighed. The people won’t understand the fine distinctions as to when an official speaks with authority and when he speaks without. I know you are watching and feel confident that you will see that the people  of  Talcher are freed from harassment well before the rains begin.
 The very simple affair of Jaipur still hangs fire. I just understand that some prisoners have been discharged. Civil disobedience having been discontinued there seems to be no cause for keeping any prisoners and that too in a snake-infested old fort. Nor is there any meaning in keeping Sheth Jamnalalji practically in solitary confinement, the cause for his detention having disappeared. The authorities were afraid that he was entering Jaipur State to promote civil disobedience. And the demand of the people is less than elementary. They would be satisfied if they have the guarantee of civil liberty. I should have thought that Jaipur would present no difficulty.libtech_690_footnote
 Lastly, Rajkot. The Award has been a halter round my neck. This situation has taxed and is still taxing all my resources. I am applying what appears to me to be a new and difficult technique. Though I am not giving up the support of the Paramount Power, I am keeping it as much as I am able in the background and am trying to woo Durbar Shri Virawala. On going back to Rajkot from Delhi I saw that I had a mountain of difficulties to face owing to the Award itself. They are all still there. And they are piling up. But I see that even for decency’s sake I must not run to you or your representative on every pretext. I shall come when I must. Meanwhile, I shall try to woo Durbar Shri Virawala and see if  I  can get anything approaching the
 
 Notification of the Thakore Saheb. If you have leisure you will watch what is happening in Rajkot. I must say that my experiences of the working of the political department are not happy. I observe that the Viceroy, no matter how strong he may be, is not powerful enough to carry out his intentions even as the Congress President is not with his voluntary departments. You will not mind the comparison. A knowledge of our little difficulties enables me to send out my sympathy to you instead of blaming you for what appear to me to be innumerable pin-pricks.
Having wandered in Calcutta and Brindaban, an out-of-the-way
 village in Champaran, I return to Rajkot hoping to reach there on 12th instant.libtech_691_footnote

      A MESSAGE    [On or After May 9, 1939]libtech_692_footnoteI observe that Senapati Bapat is reported to have said 	that I approved of his plan of drowning himself because India had 	not attained swaraj within the time stipulated or expected by him. 	When I  	saw the report I gave no credence to it. But I am overwhelmed by 	correspondents asking me whether I was consenting party and, If I 	was, on what grounds. I must say that I have  no  recollection 	whatsoever of having approved of the contemplated step. I do 	remember his having discussed the proposal among many other  things. 	But I cannot conceive of my consenting to anybody drowning himself 	for the sake of winning swaraj. If I have any influence over 	Senapati Bapat I would urge him not to take the fatal step, assuming 	that he is correctly reported. I would urge him and his disciples to 	live for swaraj and embrace death when it comes to them naturally 	and in due course.  From 	the original: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal

    CHI. 	KRISHNACHANDRA,  May 	11, 1939 
  	I have your letter. Yes, it would be good if you could  rid  	yourself of your fondness for books. You can certainly purchase on 	my behalf any religious book you may need, but for the rest you 	should seek your brother’s help. What I mean is: have just one 	book. Draw all your wisdom from that one book. What better do you 	need than the Ramayana, the Gita or Ishopanishad?  	Balkrishna’s fever causes concern. Sushila will write about it.

  To 	one of the Pressmen who enquired about his health Gandhiji said: I 	am so so. I can’t say my cough has left me.  QUESTION: 	What is your next step with regard to Rajkot?  GANDHIJI: Naturally it 	would be to take up the threads where I left them and where they are 	left.  Knowing 	that the last words of the sentence were significant, one of the 	Pressmen repeated: “Where you left them and where they are left?” 	Gandhiji clarified the words without delay. You 	are all aware that something has happened between the time I 	left Rajkot and the present moment.    
 He referred to the discussion of the scheme of reforms between the State people’s representatives and the Rajkot authorities. He added :
This scheme has not yet been found acceptable to the Praja
Parishad.
 It was asked if this scheme of reforms suggested by Durbar Virawala did not amount to a breach of promise made by the Thakore Saheb in his Notification of December 26 last, according to which the conferring of the widest powers on the people had been promised.
 Mahatmaji replied in the negative. He said that Durbar Virawala was not offering anything in terms of the December Notification. It was an independent offer. There was no question of a breach of promise as it was a scheme under discussion between the two parties. If the parties concerned accepted it, it would be a mutual settlement.
 Q.   Are the terms of reference suggested by Durbar Virawala  in his telegram   to you on the question of representation of Muslims and Bhayats on the Reforms Committee acceptable to you?
 G .    No.
 Referring to this query further, he said that the complainants and he would present their cases to the Chief Justice. Pleadings would contain prayers of parties. Gandhiji added :
Perhaps they are [seeking] a way to avoid any terms of
reference.libtech_697_footnote

   LETTER TO SHARDABEHN G. CHOKHAWALA  
 May 12, 1939
 CHI. BABUDI,
 We arrived in Rajkot today. I got your letter. You shouldn’t worry. Don’t let yourself rust. Do prepare for the Kovid examination. Give the help asked of you. Go prepared for lessons every day so that you can teach well. Procure a book of Hindi grammer. The text to be taught would be a prescribed one, so you should have no difficulty.
 
 For the present I shall have to stay in Rajkot. In June I shall have to go to Bombay for two or three days.

   SPEECH AT PRAJA PARISHAD WORKERS’ MEETING, 		RAJKOTlibtech_698_footnote  
 May 12, 1939
 I   wonder     why   my   statement   of   24thlibtech_699_footnoteApril   should   have perturbed some of you. I said nothing new in it. It was a summary of what I had toldlibtech_700_footnotelibtech_701_footnoteyou in detail just before I left Rajkot.
 So far as Vajubhailibtech_702_footnoteand his colleagues’ statement is concerned, let me tell you I have rather liked it inasmuch as it has served to bring out in clear relief the fundamental differences between his group and me. The Council of Action, it is stated, was constituted by the Parishad for the specific purpose of conducting the civil disobedience fight. Now that it has been called off sine die, its function has lapsed. I can quite understand the objection to negotiating a settlement in its name. But I am not conducting the negotiations in the Council’s name.
 Let me explain my own position in this matter. When the Award was first announced, under the exultation of the moment I allowed myself to say that the result of my Rajkot fast had exceeded my expectations. But I now find that the Chief Justice’s  Award  has become a halter round my neck .
 I did not come here at your invitation. I came here because Rajkot is the home of my childhood and because I felt I would be able to keep its Ruler to his promises. In the various steps which I have taken since my arrival here, I had been guided solely by my inner
 
 
 light and the logic of circumstances. Nobody is under any obligation to join me in my present experiment. Anybody who feels differently from me is perfectly free to go his way, and if the people of Rajkot decide to carry on the fight by following different methods, I would not mind it. I am humble enough to know that there may be  a  different way and a better way than mine of doing a thing. In no case do I want to see our people turn into cowards.
 I welcome too the suggestion about calling the Parishad and obtaining its mandate with regard to the future lines of action. But I would like you not to shut your eyes to the realities of the situation. I am trying the delicate and difficult technique of negotiating a settlement with Durbar Virawala by appealing to the better self in him, while at the same time I am pursuing the stages contemplated in the Award. The Rajkot issue is not so simple or superficial as it might appear at first sight. Behind it are ranged other and powerful forces.
 Eighteen days have elapsed since I discussedlibtech_703_footnotelibtech_704_footnotewith you the new line of approach to the Rajkot question. The passage of time has confirmed my opinion. I confess I was guilty of impatience when I wrote   to   Mr.   Gibsonlibtech_705_footnoteabout   the   interminable   delays   and   to   the Bhayatslibtech_706_footnotelibtech_707_footnotelibtech_708_footnoteabout  their  suggestion  to   refer   to   the   Chief   Justice   the meaning of my assurance to them. Such impatience reflects little credit on my ahimsa. My legal position was correct. But ahimsa does not go by legal rights.
 I have now realized that I must be content to plod on with infinite patience. It is no mango trick that can be performed in the twinkling of an eye. It calls for a more potent force even than civil disobedience, viz., the application of the active principle that lies at the core of ahimsa. This is the new light that I sense I have seen. I see it but dimly. And I am therefore unable to define it.
 I should very much like, if I could, altogether to give up the shelter of the Award before proceeding with the work of appeasing Durbar shri Virawala. But that requires courage, fearlessness  and ample faith. If I had these, I should not hesitate to plunge into a blazing fire. But such faith cannot come by mechanical means. One must wait and pray for it. I had no idea of what jail life was like when  I launched on satyagraha in South Africa. But once inside the prison
 
 it become to me like a palace, a sanctuary, a place of pilgrimage, where I learnt things which probably I would not have outside.
 If I had to act only for myself, I would not probably have hesitated to take the plunge. But as a custodian of the people’s interests I wonder if I should run any risks. Thus has conscience turned me into a coward and I am vacillating between doubt and faith. My ahimsa tells me that I must tear up the Award. But  the reason is not yet fully convinced. ‘What is the meaning of not seeking aid from the Paramount Power,’ I argue to myself , ‘when you are trying to secure the co-operation of Durbar Shri Virawala and the Thakore Saheb? Are they not all parts of one and the same system?’
 Thus I am caught in the net of my own reasoning. All this I know is a sign of lack of faith on my part.
 I cannot, while there is this conflict between the head and the heart within me , offer to take you along with me or be of much use to you as a ‘guide’. I have no set theory to go by. I have not worked out the science of satyagraha in its entirety. I am still groping. You can join me in my quest if it appeals to you and you feel the call.
 A representative is bound to consult his principals and take his instructions from them at every step. But a physician cannot afford to do so regarding his patients. He must be guided solely by his instinct and vary his treatment according to his reading of the symptoms as they might develop from moment to moment. He cannot accept dictation of the patient. I stand in a dual capacity in relation to you. I am your spokesman whom you have also accepted as your physician. You must implicitly follow the treatment laid down by your physician so long as you have faith in him. If he no longer commands your confidence, you must appoint in his place another who does.
 Only a prospective mother knows what it is to carry, The onlookers notice her illness and pity her. But she alone knows the travail. It is I who have conceived satyagraha. Mine alone, therefore, must be the travail and the suffering. I am not joking.  I  am  in  dreadful earnest. I shall enter the fiery gates and pursue my mission even if I am the only person left to do so—I am resolved to try and exhaust every resource of satyagraha to convert Durbar Virawala. If I succeed, you will all share the fruit. If I fail, the responsibility will be entirely mine and what I do will in no way affect you.
 When I was little child, there used to be two blind master performers in Rajkot. One of them was musician. When he played on his instrument, his fingers swept the strings with an unerring instinct
 
 and everybody listened spellbound to his playing. Similarly there are chords in every human heart. If we only know how to strike the right chord, we bring out the music.
Durbar Virawala in no exception to the rule.
 Have I set Durbar Virawala completely at his ease? Have I applied truth and ahimsa only in my dealings with him? Have I not threatened him with the Award?
 We want to set up democracy in Rajkot. A born democrat is a born disciplinarian. Democracy comes naturally to him who is habituated normally to yield willing obedience to all laws, human or divine. I claim to be a democrat both by instinct and training. Let those who are ambitious to serve democracy qualify themselves by satisfying first this acid test of democracy. Moreover, a democrat must be utterly selfless. He must think and dream not in terms of self or party but only of democracy. Only then does he acquire the right of civil disobedience. I do not want anybody to give up his convictions or to suppress himself. I do not believe that a healthy and honest difference of opinion will injure our cause. But opportunism, camouflage or patched-up compromises certainly will. If you must dissent, you should take care that your opinions voice your innermost convictions and are not intended merely as a convenient party cry.
 Today our democracy is choked by our internecine strife. We are torn by dissensions—dissensions between Hindus and Mussalmans, Brahmins and non-Brahmins, Congressmen and non-Congressmen. It is no easy task to evolve democracy out of this mobocracy. Let us not make confusion worse confounded by further introducing into it the virus of sectionalism and party spirit.
 I value individual freedom but you must not forget that man is essentially a social being. He has risen to this  present  status  by learning to adjust his individualism to the requirements of social progress. Unrestricted individualism is the law of the beast of the jungle. We have learnt to strike the mean between individual freedom and social restraint. Willing submission to social restraint for the sake of the well-being of the whole society enriches both the individual and the society of which one is a member.

   INTERVIEW TO ASSOCIATED PRESS OF INDIA  
 RAJKOT,
 May 12, 1939
 Gandhiji said that he was deeply grieved that the Union Government seemed to have no finality about their policylibtech_709_footnotein respect of Asiatics. Their past declarations were being disregarded and some of the recommendations made by their own Commission were also being set at naught.
 There was no wonder, he said, that a section of British Indian settlers in South Africa resented this policy, and in despair were thinking of resorting to civil disobedience. He could only hope that wiser counsels would prevail and that the Union Government would retrace their steps and respect the rights acquired by British Indian settlers.libtech_710_footnote

   TALK WITH PRAJA PARISHAD WORKERSlibtech_711_footnote  
 RAJKOT,
 [On or after May 12, 1939]libtech_712_footnote
 The statement I made on leaving Rajkot correctly represented my state of mind. The views I expressed are, if anything, stronger today. I own that I was impatient. The Award which was a tainted fruit made me impatient. That impatience was a slur on my ahimsa. It was that impatience that made me say to the Bhayats and Mussalmans that  I was not prepared to wait for Sir Maurice Gwyer’s Award on their reference, the work of the Committee must go on. There was no committee then, but impatience made me speak so.
 There is no doubt in my mind that the Award must  be renounced. How can I woo Durbar Virawala and also keep the sword of the Award hanging over his head? But where is the courage? The faint-heartedness is unworthy of a satyagrahi who must have nothing but faith in God to sustain him.

   INTERVIEW TO TRAVANCORE NATIONAL CONGRESS 		DEPUTATIONlibtech_716_footnote  
 May 13/14, 1939
 The deputationists first explained to Mahatmaji in detail the  changes introduced by the Government in the electoral system of Travancore.
 Mahatmaji said that he understood the system as it existed and also the present change, and asked :
Is this all that you have to discuss with me?
 Mr. Kainikkara said that they would like to discuss everything concerning the political situation in Travancore.
 GANDHIJI: Do you know the charge against you?
 KAINIKKARA: We know there is a great deal of misrepresentation about us and that we are under a cloud.
G. It is said that your organization, the Travancore National
 Congress, is a bogus organization, that you are not an independent body and that you are an instrument of the Government. What do you say to this?
 KAINIKKARA: We repudiated the charge. We need only say that most of us in the Travancore National Congress have been in the political field from the days of the Non-co-operation Movement. That cannot be said of many of the members of the State Congress.
G. If that be so, what have you to say regarding the treatment of
 the lady, Miss Annie Mascarene? Why is it that Sir C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar refuses to enquire into that matter?
 KAINIKKARA: Regarding Miss Mascarene, we do not wish to say anything. We would rather not discuss her	We could not demand an enquiry for we know from
 actual experience the outrages perpetrated by the followers of the State Congress . . .
 Mahatmaji asked us whether therefore we are justifying all the arrests, etc., made by the Government.
 KAINIKKARA: We are not. Some arrests may be right and some may be wrong. But how can we throw the whole blame on the Government? It is well-known that Chengannoor is a State Congress stronghold. There . . . huge banyan trees were cut
 
 down to obstruct traffic, and culverts and bridges were broken . . . Can it be said that none of the State Congress workers saw this? . . . Why did they not at least help to find out the culprits? . . . It may be better for Sir C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar to institute  an enquiry . . . but we who know the actual facts by experience cannot make the demand.
G. Do you say that it is the measures adopted by the Government
that re-established peace?
 KAINIKKARA : No. You did it. Peace was established with the stopping of civil disobedience. If civil disobedience were to be started again all the disturbances would recur.
G. Then you admit that, at the worst, the mistake on the part of
the State Congress was that they had no control over their followers.
 KOTTOOR : No, not only that. Their first fault is that they started civil disobedience without assuring themselves of their control. Their next fault is that they did not stop it even when they found their real position, and their gravest fault is that they never seriously checked their followers for the fear that they would lose their followers . .
 Then Mahatmaji asked us what our fundamental difference was with the State Congress.
 We told him that we had been demanding Responsible Government for the last twenty years . . . At that time, the Christians opposed the demand for Responsible Government. In 1932, the Christian-Ezhava-Muslim agitation for communal representation gave a new turn to Travancore politics. . . Now that the legislature is decidedly based on communal representation and the Christians dominate the communal clique, they are demanding Responsible Government.
G. Therefore you question the good faith of the Christians.
 KAINIKKARA : We do.
 G. At the beginning I put a sharp question about you. Now I put another question about them. We are trying to reach the truth.
 KAINIKKARA : Yes, we do question the good faith of the Christians.
 G. Suppose they agree to nationalize the legislature, then what objection do you have?
 KAINIKKARA : Then we have no objection.
 On the next day we met at 8 p. m. after prayers.	Mahatmaji then explained
 the position of the State Congress as he had understood it. He said that the State Congress, including the Christian section in it, was not anti-national. The far-seeing Christians, even those that might have been at one time communal, have seen that communal arrangement and pacts will not serve them in the end. He illustrated it by
 the experience of the Muslims in Bengal. He said that therefore the sinister motives that they alleged against the Christians were not real and the State Congress was national and would be prepared to nationalize the constitution of the legislature.
 Mr. Philipose explained that the attitude of the Christians in  the  State Congress was entirely national. He also said that the organization was not communal and that all communities were in it.
 KAINIKKARA : It is enough that we make our position clear and definite, Our position is this: We object to communal representation  and  Responsible Government going together. We insist on the reorganization of the legislature on purely national lines. By nationalizing we mean the removal of nominations and reservations and the application of a common principle in respect of franchise, delimitation and system of voting.
G. That is reasonable. Now my task will be to wait for the others.
How I wish to have at least one of you with me till they arrive.
 KOTTOOR : But Mahatmaji, you have not told us your opinion about the change in the voting system.
G. It does not very seriously concern me. For, after all, it does not
solve the difficulties.
 KOTTOOR: I hope, however, that you do not consider the change anti-national.
 G. The position is this. The arrangement that subsisted was anti- national. You think that by this change at least one evil is removed. But in my view what is left is still anti-national . The whole thing must be changed. It must be made national.
 PHILIPOSE : It would be good, if it came before the elections.
 KAINIKKARA : We have no illusions about Responsible Government coming within three weeks.
G. Let Responsible Government take its own time. If the present
 anti-national system could be changed before that, even that would be  a great thing.
 Mr. Kayyalakkal said that for the last many years they, the Ezhavas, had been trying to remove social and religious inequalities. Realizing that temple-entry alone could solve the problem, his brother-in-law, Mr. T. K. Madhavan, placed the matter at Gandhiji’s feet. By the grace of H. H. the Maharaja and the blessings of Mahatmaji, they had got it now. Now Gandhiji must bless them and help them to live as one with the  rest of the Hindu and to contribute their share for the prosperity and well-being  of the Hindu community as a whole.
G. Blessings you always have in plenty. Help I have given. Now
 you have to help yourselves.
 
 Just then the clock struck and Gandhiji smilingly said: “The curfew tolls”, and Mr. Kainikkara completed, “the knell of parting day”. Gandhiji repeated :
Yes, exactly, the knell of parting day.

   LETTER TO AKBAR HYDARI  
 ANANDKUNJ, RAJKOT,
 May 15, 1939
 DEAR SIR AKBAR,
 I have to acknowledge your kind letters of 11th  and  25th ultimo.
 As you are aware, during the eighteen days before the 12th instant, Calcutta and Brindaban in Champaran claimed my attention. I was unable to see the Aryasamaj friends during those days. But they waylaid me on the 10th as I was journeying back to Rajkot. This accounts for the unavoidable delay in acknowledging and dealing with your important letters. I don’t propose to go into the past nor into the replies the Aryasamaj friends have favoured me with.
The minimum requirements of the Aryasamajists are:
  Absolute 	freedom for the practice 	and preaching 	of the 	Vedic religion and 	culture, with 	due regard to 	the feelings of 	the followers 	of other faiths.  Full 	freedom for starting 	new Aryasamajas 	and building 	of new 	Aryasamaj mandirs 	yajnashalas, havankundas and 	the repairing of 	the old 	ones without obtaining 	any premission from 	the Ecclesiastical 	or any other 	department of the State. 
 Your letters lead me to think that you have no serious objections to conceding these. If my reading is correct, why wait for the reforms or the establishment of the ecclesiastical court? You will considerably enhance the cause of peace, if you could possibly make the suggested gesture. The Aryasamajist civil disobedience will then stop at once.
 Yours sincerely,
 BAPU

It is 	not only faint-heartedness but it smacks of diplomacy. If I want 	Durbar Virawala to act on the square I must relieve his fears too. 	Why should he have to remain in fear of the Paramount Power and not 	do what he can of his own free will? I am talking so much of ahimsa, 	but  I am not walking fearlessly into the mouth of himsa. A 	satyagrahi seeks no adventitious aid—not of worldly forces, not of 	the Paramount Power. He deals directly wih his opponent and wins him 	by love and utter self-surrender to God. The very difficulty of 	implementing the Award, the very fact that it has proved a Pandora’s 	box shows that God wants me to throw it away, however seemingly 	fruitful of future good it may be. God seems to be speaking to me in 	strident tones; ‘Your victory was no victory. Throw it away !’ 	You want me to go on with the work of the Award, because it belongs 	to     
 you. But how can I go on with it when my courage fails me, my hands are shaking and I am faltering? It is a moral issue with me. The consciousness of the wrong of the initial step I took oppresses me and  I cannot go on with it, however much you may want me to go on with it. What will you do with such a halting, faltering general? I must throw the Award overboard and you in your turn may throw the general overboard.

   TALCHER  
 Talcher promises to be much worse than Rajkot. In Rajkot it was the Ruler’s word that was broken. In Talcher it is the Paramount Power’s. In Rajkot the State atrocities were not the subject of scrutiny. In Talcher the sorry condition of the numerous refugees is almost everything. Hence delay is criminal and may mean loss of one year’s crop to several thousand cultivators. The other relief promised by the Political Agent, Major Hennessey, relates to paltry things so far as the Ruler of Talcher is concerned but they are serious enough for the people.
 It has been whispered to me that I have been guilty of injustice to Major Hennessey and hence to the Paramount Power by attributing to them breach of promise; for, it is said, Major Hennessey promised nothing, he merely undertook to convey to the Ruler the wishes of the people concerned. It is further said that even if it is proved that he made any such promise he did so without authority.
 I cannot admit either of the pleas. Major Hennessey signed the document without any reservations. Shri Harekrushna Mahtab described the tragedy with a wealth of detail which compels conviction. He has been an eye-witness of the events narrated by him. So far as I am aware Major Hennessey himself has never denied or has not been given an opportunity of denying the allegations made about him.
 There seems to be no doubt that the Ruler of Talcher is in no mood to do justice to his people unless he is made to act according to the   sanad   I   have   already   reproducedlibtech_726_footnotein   these   columns.   The representative of the Paramount Power can even require the smaller
 
 States of Orissa to perform acts in the interest of their people. Can there be any doubt as to the necessity of redressing every one of the injustices mentioned in the memorandum signed by  Major Hennessey? Indeed redress has been long overdue. Why is the Ruler being humoured by the Political Department in  his  wholly indefensible attitude? Why is the welfare of several thousand refugees being lightly regarded? Is not the prestige of the Paramount Power being used to sustain the admitted evils? Surely there is something radically wrong somewhere in all this.

       KANTHI    TELEGRAM TO KANTHI      May 	17, 1939 
  K. P. C. C. MEMBER 	HUBLI  MY	WRITING	CAN	PERMIT	NO	COERCION.  From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal      STATEMENT  TO THE PRESSlibtech_727_footnote    RAJKOT,  May 	17, 1939  	I saidlibtech_728_footnotelibtech_729_footnotelibtech_730_footnoteat 	Calcutta on the 24th ultimo that Rajkot had proved a laboratory for 	me. The latest proof of the fact lies in the step I am now 	announcing. After an exhaustive discussion with my co-workers I have 	come to the conclusion at 6 o’clock this evening that I should 	renounce the advantages accruing from the Award of the  Chief  	Justice.  	I recognize my error. At the end of my fast I had permitted myself 	to say that it had succeeded as no previous fast had done. I now see 	that it was tainted with himsa. In taking the fast I sought 	immediate intervention of the Paramount Power so as to induce 	fulfilment of the promise made by the Thakore Saheb. This was not     
 the way of ahimsa or conversion. It was the way of himsa or coercion. My fast to be pure should have been addressed only to the Thakore Saheb and I should have been content to die if I could not have melted his heart or rather that of his adviser, Durbar Shri Virawala. My eyes would not have been opened if I had not found unexpected difficulties in my way. Durbar Shri Virawala was no willing party to the Award. Naturally, he was in no obliging mood. He therefore took advantage of every opportunity to cause a delay. The Award, instead of making my way smooth, became a potent cause of angering the Muslims and Bhayats against me. Before the Award we had met as friend. Now I am accused of having committed a breach of promise, voluntarily and without any consideration, made by me. The matter was to go to the Chief Justice for decision as to whether I was guilty of the alleged breach of promise. The statements of the Muslim Council and the Garasia Association are before me. Now that I have taken the decision to renounce the Award, there is no occasion for me to answer the two cases. So far as I am concerned, the Muslims and Bhayats can have anything the Thakore Saheb may be pleased to give them. I must apologize to them for having put them to the trouble of preparing their cases.
 I owe an apology to the Viceroy for the unnecessary strain I have put upon him in my weakness. I apologize to the Chief Justice for having been the cause of putting him to the labour which had I known better, he need not have gone through. Above all, I apologize to the Thakore Saheb and Durbar Shri Virawala. So far as the latter is concerned, I must also own that, in common with my co-workers, I have harboured evil thoughts about him. I do not here pause to consider whether the charges made against him were true or not. This is not the place to discuss them. Suffice it to say that the way of ahimsa was not and had not yet been applied to him.
 And let it be said to my discredit that I have been guilty of playing what may be called a double game, i. e., hanging the sword of the Award over his head and wooing him and expecting him of his own free will to advise the Thakore Saheb to grant liberal reforms.
 This method I admit is wholly inconsistent with ahimsa. When all of a sudden I made what is known as a sporting offer to Mr. Gibson on 19th April, I discovered my weakness. But I had not the courage then and there to say, ‘I do not want to have anything to do with the Award.’ Instead I said,‘Let the Thakore Saheb appoint his own Committee and then the Parishad people will examine the report
 in terms of the Award, and if it is found defective it can go to the Chief Justice.’ Durbar Shri Virawala detected a  flaw  and  very properly rejected the offer, saying: ‘You are still hanging the Award over my head and want to become a court of appeal over the Thakore Saheb’s Committee. If such is the case, you must take your pound of flesh and no more’. I saw the force of his objection. I told him, too, that I lacked the courage then to throw the Award overboard, but I would still plead with him to come to terms with the people as if the Award was not in existence and as if the Sardar and I had also withdrawn. He promised to try. He tried in his own fashion but not with a large heart. I do not blame him. How could I expect large heart when he knew my faint-heartedness in clinging to the Award?
 Only trust can beget trust. I lacked it myself. But at last I have regained my lost courage. My faith in the sovereign efficacy of ahimsa burns brighter for my confession and repentance.
 I must not do an injustice to my co-workers. Many of them are filled with misgivings. My exposition of ahimsa is new to them. They see no cause for my repentance. They think that I am giving up a great chance created by the Award. They think too that as a political leader I have no right to play fast and loose with the fortunes of 75,000 souls, maybe of the whole of the people of Kathiawar. I have told them that their fears are unjustified, and that every act of purification, every accession of courage, adds to the strength of the cause of a people affected by a movement of satyagraha. I have told them, too, that if they regard me as the general and expert of satyagraha, they must put up with what may appear to them to be my vagaries.
 Having now freed the Thakore Saheb and his adviser from the oppression of the Award, I have no hesitation in appealing to them to appease the people of Rajkot by fulfilling their expectations and dispelling their misgivings.

   DISCUSSION WITH MAHADEV DESAIlibtech_731_footnote  
 [May 17, 1939]libtech_732_footnote
 MAHADEV DESAI: How was it wrong to ask the Paramount Power to intervene? You did not insist on the letter of your vow. Otherwise you might have said you could not break the fast until your demand was satisfied. But you were content with the arbitration of the Chief Justice. Even so in 1918libtech_733_footnotewhen you fasted during the Ahmedabad labour strike you did not insist on the 35 percent increase in wage but you contented yourself with the mill-owners consenting to an arbitration. In fact, if the Thakore Saheb had yielded to your demand without the intervention of the Paramount Power, he might have charged you with having coerced him. But here the arbitration which was the result of the fast ought to have been given [to] you even without the fast.
 GANDHIJI: You are right. But why don’t you see that in 1918libtech_734_footnotelibtech_735_footnotethe
 arbitration was offered by the mill-owners? If the Thakore Saheb had offered arbitration of his own accord, it would have been splendid. But here I appealed to the Paramount Power. That is why the arbitration has been infructuous. I had no business to be impatient. Instead of waiting on God and allowing my fast to work itself I sought outside aid. It was a grave blunder.
 But why not wait until Sir Maurice Gwyer gives his decision on the new
 reference? Let not the Mussalmans and Bhayats have the pretext of saying you fought shy of the Chief Justice’s decision.
 Why must I wait to take the right decision? It cannot await a moments’s delay. I know that the reference is mischievous and we must win. That might give greater value to the renunciation. But I am not renouncing the Award in order that the world may acclaim the act. By no means. I am freeing myself from a terrible oppression . I have made my decision and am feeling free as a bird.

   TALKS WITH CO-WORKERS, RAJKOTlibtech_736_footnote  
 [ Afrer May 17, 1939]libtech_737_footnote
 I proved myself of little faith. If I had staked my all on my faith in God and on the efficacy of my fast in melting the Thakore Saheb’s and Durbar Shri Virawala’s heart, the worst that could have happened would have been my death. But it would have been a worthy death. And if the Thakore Saheb and Virawala had not let me die, they would have come to me as friends and given me what I wanted. In any event the result would have been better than the breach of my faith in God and making Durbar Virawala my enemy by appealing to the Viceroy to intervene and even to turn him out. I am amazed at my own folly in thus antagonizing him and still expecting to convert him. His own generosity is, I think, out of proportion to the provocation I had given him.
My hands are shaking and my steps faltering.
 The very possession of this Award has made me a coward, and I am afraid if I were to retain it, it would make cowards of you too. A satyagrahi does not depend for his strength on external means. His strength comes from within, from his reliance on God. God becomes his shield when he throws down all his earthly weapons. But if he were to hide a fire-arm in his pocket, his inner strength would go and he would cease to feel invulnerable. The Award was very like a fire-arm in the pocket of a votary of ahimsa like me. It stood between me and my God. It shamed me and made a coward of me. I have thrown it away as Christian did his load of sin, and I am feeling again free and invulnerable and one with my Maker.
 You ought to understand and appreciate the rejection of the Award. It was well-nigh impossible for you to have (to use the legal language) that decree executed. I could have got it done, but at the cost of enormous labour and time and the legal talent that I still possess. Meanwhile your energies would have been rusting, and your hands would have been crippled. You would have learnt nothing from
 
 the skill with which I should have been tackling the fresh hurdles that were being daily placed in my way. I have saved  you  from  the  burden of my sin. You are, at worst,‘as you were’. if you want foolishly to march to jail, you are now free. Only you must not look to me. I can carry you forward along my own lines. It may be that I am unfit to lead you. You can then discard me, and you have every right to do so. You may not tolerate a general who changes his tactics every now and then. But if you will have me, you must have me on my terms.
 I have not yet known a general who has not altered time and again the plans of his campaign and made eleventh-hour alterations in his orders. The ordinary fighting soldier knows nothing  of these plans. In fact they are closely-guarded secret unknown to all but the general himself. That is why Tennyson wrote those immortal lines— ""Theirs not to reason why, theirs not to make reply, theirs but to do and die”. But these words apply, if you please, to a satyagrahi army more appropriately than to the ordinary army. For a military general may change his plans in view of the changing situation every day. A military strategy depends on the changing tactics of the enemy. The satyagrahi general has to obey his inner voice, for over and above the situation outside he examines himself constantly and listens to the dictates of the inner self. But both in satyagraha and military warfare the position of the soldier is very nearly the same. He knows no rest, no certainty of movements, the only certainty for him is to face heavy odds and even death. His promise to be under discipline and to obey the general’s command applies even during the period of suspension of hostilities. But I have not asked for this kind of discipline. I have always tried to carry conviction to my co-workers, to carry  their  hearts, and their reasons with me. I shall go on doing so always, but where you cannot follow, you will have to have faith. In ordinary warfare one soldier cannot reason why. In our warfare there is enough scope for reasoning, but there is a limit to it. You will go on arguing until you are convinced, but when no conviction comes, you must fall back on faith.
 There is now the way of negotiation open to you, but if you cannot think of it, it is open to you to fight. In fact if I had not cast away the Award, the fight would have been long delayed. I have saved you a few months. But you can overthrow my leadership and be free. From the point of view of satyagraha there is nothing but good coming out of the decision. A general is none the worse for
 realization of his weakness and for atoning for his sin. In fact sin, ignorance, weakness are synonymous, and in asking for the Viceroy’s intervention and clinging to the Award I was guilty of all the three. When a general purifies himself as I have done, far from weakening his army he adds to its strength enormously.
 There should not be the least little suspicion in your mind that Durbar Virawala cannot be converted, no matter how non-violent you may be. Do you mean to say that he is the concentrated essence of evil in Kathiawar? Let me assure you that we in his position might have done no better. Every one of us is a mixture of good and evil. Is there not plenty of evil in us? There is enough of it in me and I always pray to God to purge me of it. The difference that there is between human beings is the difference of degree, and you must always try to place yourself in the position of the man you are about to judge. Virtue lies in discovering the best in your opponent and in appealing to it.
 This depends on individual workers cultivating non-violence in thought, word and deed, by means of a concentrated effort in the fulfilment of the fourfold constructive programme.  Maximum  of work and minimun of speech must be your motto. In the centre of the pro-gramme is the spinning-wheel—no haphazard programme of spinning, but scientific understanding of every detail, including the mechanics and the mathematics of it, study of cotton and its varieties, and so on. There is the programme of literacy. You must concentrate exclusively on it, and not talk of any other thing. The work should be systematic and according to time table. Don’t talk of politics—not even of non-violence—but talk to them of the advantages of literacy. There is prohibition of drink and intoxicating drugs and of gambling. There is medical relief by means of the propagation of simple rules of hygiene and sanitation and elementary preventive measures, and of cheap home remedies and training intelligent village folk in these.
 There should not be one house in Rajkot with which you have not established contact from the point of view of pure service. You have to cultivate the Mussalmans, serve them unselfishly. There are the Harijans. Establish living contact with them.
 All this constructive work should be for its own sake. And yet be sure that it will develop the quality required for  non-violent responsible government. That is how I began my work in  South Africa. I began with serving them. I did not know myself that I was training them for civil disobedience. I did not know myself that I was
 so training myself. But you all know what happened in the end.
 This constructive programme may go on endlessly. Why should you be tired of it? Do you know the Hundred Years’ War in England? If they fought for a hundred years, we should be prepared to fight for  a thousand years, inasmuch as we are a continent. That we will have given our contribution to the fight for freedom, will be our reward
 That is the mass constructive programme I want you to do, and that is the basis of the training for the non-violence of the brave. It is whole and indivisible, and those who do not believe in it whole- heartedly must leave me and work according to their own lights.
 Q. If the situation is different, if the people in a State are to a man ready to offer the utmost they can?
 A. Then I would say to them: “Be reduced to ashes’. But that will be on one condition, viz., that you have reached the state of non- violence of my description. If I can have that assurance, I would say that though it is unequal battle you may fight single-handed in spite of opposition from the Paramount Power and the States. I would be the last person to cool the zeal and ardour of the people.
 Q. But would it not suffice if the workers were pledged to carry out the programme and carried it out faithfully?
 A. Hardly. For you have to give a visible demonstration of the fact that the whole of the State obeys your discipline. You want responsible government for all, not merely for the workers.
 Gandhiji gave two instances. In 1922 he was sent to jail. He gave express instructionslibtech_738_footnoteto the effect that there should be no hartal, no demonstrations, work should go on as usual. A Secretary of State had described the situation in his derisive way: “When Gandhiji went to jail not a dog barked”. But Gandhiji accepted it as a compliment and said that he was responsible for the quiet that prevailed. The people had literally carried out his instructions. Another instance: In 1921 there were the riots in Bombay. Gandhiji declared a fast until the rioters came to their senses.libtech_739_footnoteMian Mahomed Haji Jan Mahomed Chhotani was then living. He had complete control on the mischievous element, and he said to Gandhiji: “Please break the fast. I know these men, they are under my control and I assure you they will be quiet.” Gandhiji said:
You should be able to say that with regard to all whether they
belong to your party or not. To acquire that control the people should
 
 fulfil the constructive programme in all its details. Non-violence has failed in exact proportion to the failure of the charkha. There are other items—prohibition, Hindu-Muslim unity, removal of untouchability. It is difficult to submit individuals to the test in these items. There is room for self-deception. Not so in the matter of the wheel. The work can be measured from day to day.
 You have to take up the programme with apostolic zeal. I cannot give you a new programme. Civil disobedience is for the few who are saturated with the spirit of non-violence and are ready for the utmost sacrifice. Constructive programme is for all. It is to be accepted by all actively and not as a lip profession. It has got to be worked or not worked. Khadi is worn or not worn. Let this fourfold programme be the acid test of your followers. Otherwise of course don’t the cinema companies and cigarette sellers have a large enough following? Don’t be deluded by those who gather about you and shout ‘ Inquilab zindabad’libtech_740_footnoteor swear at someone or other.
 Banish all idle thoughts from your hearts and concentrate only on the thoughts you must have. You will thus obtain  marvellous control over yourselves and others. A good man’s thought never goes in vain. Thought-control means maximum of work with minimum of energy. If we had that control, we should not have to put forth the tremendous effort we do. Non-violent action does mean much silent work and little speech or writing. These will always be necessary because thought- control is not an easy thing. Nevertheless we have to cultivate that habit if we will have non-violence reigning supreme in this land and if we are to have responsible government through unadulterated non-violence.
 CO-WORKER : Whether we stand the test or not, you alone can say, not we.
 GANDHIJI: No, I cannot presume to say that. If you can affirm that you have living faith in God, no matter how you define God, it should be enough. You believe in some principle, clothe it with life, and say that it is your God and you believe in it. I should think it enough. I fasted apparently with complete faith in God. But instead of God I called the Viceroy to my aid. The satyagrahi has no other stay but God. For the moment my faith in God was dead.
 Q. But then an atheist like Bradlaughlibtech_741_footnotemay have the capacity to sacrifice all.
 
 
 But you would rule him out as a satyagrahi?
 A. I am afraid I would. Such a man is worthy of my reverence; but such a one would himself say he is not a satyagrahi of my definition. But I may be doing an injustice to his memory. I never had the privilege of meeting him. He might have had a living faith in an indefinable, self-acting Power whilst he declared himself an atheist.

    INTERVIEW TO STEELlibtech_742_footnote       RAJKOT, 
   STEEL: 	What is your idea of independence?  [After 	 May 17, 1939]libtech_743_footnote 
  GANDHIJI : 	By independence I mean complete withdrawal of British power 	from India. It does not exclude partnership between two nations 	enjoying equal independent status and terminable by either at will. 	It need not be different from Dominion Status. But perhaps Dominion 	Status won’t be a happy term to use for a continent like India 	which is ethnologically and politically different from other 	Dominions like South Africa. Canada, Australia etc. But perhaps this 	term is as elastic as the English Constitution. And if Dominion 	Status could be so defined as to cover a case like India and if 	India could come to an honourable agreement with England, I would 	not quarrel about words. If British statesmen feel it convenient to 	use the word Dominion Status about India rather than any other, in 	order  to  describe that honourable agreement, I will not quarrel.  S. 	But there are elements in the Congress like Subhas Bose and his 	group who want absolute independence outside the British Empire. G. 	 It  is  only a  question  of  terminology.  I won’t  	admit	any  	difference between Subhas Babu and myself on this point though we 	may use different language. Supposing such free and  equal 	partnership as I have postulated were feasible, Subhas Babu won’t 	say ‘No’ to it. But today if such a proposition were put to him, 	he will probably say, as he well may, it is ruled out for him. For 	he would say     
 the British are not likely to yield so easily as some might think. If he talks to me like that, I won’t combat him but would say that I prefer to use the language that I use as being more suited to my temperament and my faith in the essential identity of human nature.
 Gandhiji’s interviewer next wanted to know if there were any negotiations going on between him and the authorities in connection with the ‘Federation’.
G. None whatsoever. All suggestions to this effect that one sees in
 the Press are mere figments of imagination. The present Viceroy is not made that way. He does not believe in doing things secretly. He puts all his cards on the table and likes taking the public into his confidence. At any rate that is my impression. I think he does believe that no cause is damaged by open negotiation.
 But I feel certain that the 'Federation’ won’t come whilst it is not acceptable to the Congress or the Mussalmans or the Princes. I am inclined to think that the British statesmen wont’t impose Federation upon an unwilling and dissatisfied India, but will try to placate all parties. That, at any rate, is my hope.
 It would be first-class tragedy if it is imposed upon India. The federal structure cannot be brought into being in the midst of sullenness and opposition. If the 'Federation’ is not wanted by any of the parties, it would be the height of impudence to force it.
 S.	What is the alternative?
 G.	The alternative may be to offer something that would be acceptable to all or either of the three parties.
 S.	But you do not believe with Subhas Bose that the best alternative would be to issue an ultimatum?
G.	That is the fundamental difference between Subhas Babu
 and myself. Not that the ultimatum is in itself wrong, but it has to be backed by an effective sanction and there are today no non-violent sanctions. If all the parties come to an honourable understanding, an effective sanction could be easily forged.
 Referring next to the communal situation, Mr. Steel asked whether, in Gandhiji’s opinion, the Hindu-Muslim situation was getting worse.
G.	Apparently   yes, perhaps.   But   I   have   every   hope that
 ultimately we are bound to come together. The interests that are common to us and that bind us together are so tremendous that the leaders of both the sections must come to terms.  Force of circumstances will compel them to do so. That we appear to  be  farthest apart from one another today is a natural outcome of the awakening  that   has  taken  place.  It  has  emphasized   the   points  of
 difference and accentuated prejudices, mutual suspicions and jealousies. Fresh demands that are coming into being every day with the new leadership have further made confusion worse confounded. But I hope out of chaos order is going to emerge.
 S.	Are not the differences between the Muslim League and the Congress unbridgeable?
G.	The differences are insubstantial.
 S.	You think the time is not ripe for an ultimatum; what then should the next move be?
G.	To put our own house in order. Immediately we have done
that and brought the various elements together, we should be ready.
 S.	What help do you expect from the U. S. A.?
 G. I expect a lot of help from the U. S. A. by way of friendly criticism, if it must be criticism. What I find today is that it is either excessive praise of Indian effort of hopelessly  unenlightened  criticism. Your Press has made very little effort to enlighten American opinion on the right lines.
 S. Does your renunciation of the Award imply an abandonment of effort?
 G. By no means. On the contrary, having eased myself of the burden of error, I feel as light as a bird and freer to continue my effort to solve the problem of the Indian States.

   DISCUSSION WITH KASTURBA GANDHIlibtech_746_footnote  
 [May 18, 1939]libtech_747_footnote
 GANDHIJI (smilingly) ; But why would you not plead my case?
 KASTURBA: But how can I? I do not myself understand.
 But you must understand. You remember the time in South Africa when you were dying and the doctor said you would not live unless you took chicken broth?
 Oh yes, I remember.
 Well, if you do, don’t you also remember that though I allowed you to do as you liked you said you would prefer to die but you could not take chicken broth?
 Yes.
 That was because you were firm in your faith in God. You knew that God would keep you if He so willed, but that you would not care to live by breaking your vow not to touch meat.
 Yes.
 Even so I should have fasted until the Thakore Saheb and Durbar Virawala had come to me relenting and saying, ‘Please break your fast. We are going to fulfil our promise’. Instead I wavered. I thought I must seek the aid of the British Government, lest I should die. It was a sin. And if I got the Award by committing the sin, I must give up the fruit of sin.
 But Thakore Saheb and Virawala are placing obstructions in the way. If they were not doing so, the Award would work all right and there would be an end to all the trouble. They are so obstreperous.
 They  are so, because of my initial blunder. I irritated them and  I have no right to expect better treatment from them. It is not they
 
 who are putting the obstacles. It is God acting through them who is putting the obstacles. It is God who has thus opened my eyes and shown me the way. And the sooner I wash my hands of the sin the better. Don’t you think so?
 Yes. But what of the repressive ordinances, the fines, etc.? We have given up everything and they are still going on as usual.
 What does that matter? We have to do our duty, trusting them to do theirs. Why don’t you see that because I failed in my duty and was impatient to reap the result of my fast or to break it soon that God has punished me thus? But I am not defeated. Tell sister there is no defeat in the confession of one’s error. The confession itself is a victory.

   TALK WITH A CHILDlibtech_748_footnote  
 [On  or after May 18, 1939]libtech_749_footnote
 GANDHIJI: The Award was a cobra. And when we have a cobra in the house how do we feel?
 CHILD: We are afraid.
 Well then so long as the Award was there both Durbar shri Virawala and I were afraid of it, and were trying to dodge it. But It would not be dodged. I have gently put it out of the house and we are both now free from fear.
 I see that it was necessary to discard the Award, but what have we gained?
 Is it a small gain to have been rid of a venomous cobra and thus rid of fear? It was a cobra in the house. We can now live in the house like a happy family. Durbar Shri Virawala and I not only sought to dodge the cobra but we used to shun each other. We at least meet each other now as friends !
 But what is it worth? What is there in Durbar Shri Virawala to draw out?
 What is there in you? Well, if there are any virtues in you, even so there are in Durbar Shri Virawala. And if I hug you as my own child, why should I not hug Durbar Shri Virawala as a member of the family? I know you; I do not know Durbar Shri Virawala. But we have to be friends with him and to make the best of the virtues that he surely has. As you have atman in you, even so has he. Indeed there is
 
 no human being but has something valuable in him, some quality of the atman, if we can but observingly distil it out.
 But what are we to do after the cobra is gone? With the cobra seems to have gone even the house—all that we had won.
No, nothing else is gone. The Notification is still there. And we
 are the wiser for the experience of the past three months. I had taken  a wrong route, I have retraced my step. We thought that we could achieve much by hard swearing. We know that it had a contrary result. We have examined the quality of our ahimsa. It was poor. We had made enemies of our opponents. We have to win them by love, and the way is now clear for us. Our fight for freedom is not over. It cannot be over. But we are now free to carry it on in a  better atmosphere and with cleaner weapons.

 A moral question cannot be decided by a third person. It can only be decided by one’s own conscience.
 Gandhiji adds that what was to be decided by the Chief Justice was their claim to secure a right based on Gandhiji’s words. Now there remained nothing for them to claim, inasmuch as he had renounced the Gwyer Award itself.
 As for the charge of breach of promise, Gandhiji says that, if he had the least suspicion of having committed a breach of promise, they would not have had to go to an arbitrator. He was fully aware of what he had said. All that was however now a matter of the past.libtech_753_footnote

Have 	I ever resorted to flattery even in Public interest? I declared 	years ago that I  	would not sell truth and non-violence even for the freedom of my 	country, and I have repeated it many times since. Would he who said 	it resort to flattery? When Durbar Shri Virawala invited me to go to 	the palace, he even said that I had justified my claim to be as the 	father of the Thakore Saheb, that the latter would gladly come and 	see me, but that he would be happy if I went there. He said I need 	not attend the Durbar which was to be held, but that he would ask 	the people to wait  a while to see me when I went there. I saw what 	he meant, but  I was      
 determined to attend even the Durbar if he had so desired. I would have attended it even if he had told me that it was in celebration of the Thakore Saheb’s victory and my defeat. I had offended him  by  having secured the Award over his head, and I owed it to him to wipe out the offence by attending the function. It was a debt I owed and I was in honour bound to repay it with interest. He might have asked for even an act of humiliation from me, and I might have done anything short of sacrificing my sense of self-respect or honour. But he asked me to do nothing of the kind. The invitation was natural and polite. The Durbar was held to announce the repeal of repressive legislations, etc. and the formation of the Reforms Committee. He who atones for sins never calculates; he pours out the whole essence of his contrite heart. I may tell you that my atonement is not yet over. I know that I am speaking in a language that is beyond you, but if you have had even a slight glimpse of true ahimsa, you should feel that all that I am doing now is the most natural thing for me.
 A non-violent fight is sharp as the edge of the sword, sharpened on the whetstone of the heart. A straight fight in an equal battle takes some bravery; but braver is he who, knowing that he is fighting an unequal battle, knowing that he would have to sacrifice 95 as against 5 of the enemy, faces death. That is why we still extol the prowess of Pratap and Shivaji. But a satyagrahi risks all and offers of himself a willing and pure sacrifice. Without the will and the purity the sacrifice is nothing worth. I assure you that what I have done is what every true satyagrahi ought to do. “Whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. ”

 booklibtech_762_footnote. There is a hitch about the book being released for publication. I think there is no hurry about it.
 I see that you have finished one year, and am glad that you have gained considerable inward experience. You must have seen from my recent writings how much value I attach to spinning as an aid to the growth of the spirit of non-violence, that is to say when spinning is done as a symbol of non-violence. Mechanically considered too, a person who spins for hours together, takes delight in it, will not be easily ruffled. He is able to meditate all the while he is spinning, provided his wheel is in perfect order, when the music of the wheel is an aid to contemplation. And he is no spinner who has no control over his wheel. I do wish that your second year is commenced with the resolution to achieve perfection in spinning as an aid to the development of non-violence. Your experience and experiment will help me considerably, as I believe you to be accurate in reading your own heart. Not many are able to do so. Men are more self-deceived than deceiving.

 472 THE JEWISH QUESTION
 The Managing Editor of Jewish Frontier, published at 275 Seventh Avenue, New York City, was good enough to send me a copy of the March number of the magazine with the request that I should deal with its reply to my articlelibtech_768_footnoteon the Jews in Germany and Palestine. The reply is very ably written. I wish I had space for reproducing the whole of it. The reader will, however, find the main argument reproducedlibtech_769_footnotein this issue of Harijan.
 Let me say that I did not write the article as a critic. I wrote it at the pressing request of Jewish friends and correspondents. As I decided to write, I could not do so in any other manner.
 But I did not entertain the hope when I wrote it that the Jews would be at once converted to my view. I should have been satisfied if even one Jew had been fully convinced and converted.
 Nor did I write the article only for today. I flatter myself with the belief that some of my writings will survive me and will be of service to the causes for which they have been written. I have no sense of disappointment that my writing had not to my knowledge converted a single Jew.
 Having read the reply more than once, I must say that I see no reason to change the opinion I expressed in my article. It is highly probable that, as the writer says, “a Jewish Gandhi in Germany, should one arise, could function for about five minutes and would be  promptly taken to the guillotine”. But that will not disprove my case or shake my belief in the efficacy of ahimsa. I can conceive the necessity of the immolation of hundreds, if not thousands, to appease the hunger of dictators who have no belief in ahimsa. Indeed the maxim is that ahimsa is the most efficacious in front of the greatest himsa. Its quality is really tested only in such cases. Sufferers need not
 
 see the result during their lifetime. They must have faith that if their cult survives, the result is a certainty. The method of violence gives no greater guarantee than that of non-violence. It gives infinitely less. For the faith of the votary of ahimsa is lacking.
 The writer contends that I approached the Jewish problem “without that fundamental earnestness and passionate search for truth which are so characteristic of his usual treatment of problems”. All I can say is that to my knowledge there was lack neither of earnestness nor of passion for truth when I wrote the article. The second charge of the writer is more serious. He thinks that my zeal for Hindu-Muslim unity made me partial to the Arab presentation of the case, especially as that side was naturally emphasized in India. I have often said that I would not sell truth for the sake of India’s deliverance. Much less would I do so for winning Muslim friendship. The writer thinks that I am wrong on the Jewish question as I was wrong on the Khilafat question. Even at this distance of time I have no regret whatsoever for having taken up the Khilafat cause.libtech_770_footnoteI know that my persistence does not prove the correctness of my attitude. Only it is necessary for everyone concerned to know where I stand today about my action in 1919-20
 I am painfully conscious of the fact that this writing of mine will give no satisfaction either to the Editor of Jewish Frontier or to my many Jewish friends. Nevertheless I wish with all my heart that somehow or other the persecution of the Jews in Germany will end and that the question in Palestine will be settled to the satisfaction of all the parties concernedlibtech_771_footnote.

 473. WITHDRAWN
 In  Harijan of December 24 there is a long report of my talklibtech_772_footnotewith missionary friends from Tambaram on non-violence and the world crisis. When during the talk I took the illustration of the Jews, I am reported to have said:
 It is true that the Jews have not been actively violent in their own persons.
 
 But they called down upon the Germans the curses of mankind, and they wanted America and England to fight Germany on their behalf.
 On reading the last sentence a dear friend wrote to me a fiery letter and challenged me to produce my authority for my remark. He said that I had been hasty in making the statement. I did not realize the importance of the rebuke. I did, however, want to produce support for my statement. I put Pyarelal and later Mahadev on the search. It is not always an easy task to find support for impressions one carries when speaking or writing. Meanwhile I received a letter from Lord Samuel supporting the contradiction of the friend referred to above. Whilst I was having the search made I got the following letter from Sir Philip Hartog:
 May I take the opportunity of saying that I agree with what my friend Mr. Polak and Lord Samuel tell me they have written to you about the attitude of the German Jewish refugees, of whom I have myself seen hundreds since 1933? I have never heard one of them express publicly or privately the desire for a war of vengeance against Germany. Indeed such a war would bring further misery to the hundreds of thousands of Jews still in Germany as well as untold suffering to millions of other innocent men and women.
 I put greater diligence in my search. The searchers were not able to lay hands on any conclusive writing. The manager of Harijan put himself in correspondence with the Editor of the Jewish Tribune, Bombay, who sent the following characteristic reply:
 This is not the first time that I have come across the imputation made against Jews that they urge countries like England and America to go  to war against Germany  on account of its persecution of Jews. Jews have never urged the democracies to wage war against Germany on account of its persecution of the Jews. This is a mischievous lie that must be nailed to the counter. If there is a war, Jews will suffer more than the rest of the population. This is a fact gleaned from the pages of history. And the Jew is   a great lover and advocate of peace. I hope you will refute any such allegation that is made against them.
 In the face of the foregoing weighty contradictions now enforced by the Editor of the Jewish Tribune and of the fact that I cannot lay my hands on anything on the strength of which I made the challenged observation, I must withdraw it without any reservation. I only hope that my observation has not harmed any single Jew. I know
 that I incurred the wrath of many German friends for what I said in all good faith.

 474.   MESSAGE TO INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICAlibtech_773_footnote
 RAJKOT,
 May 23, 1939
 It has been a matter of grief to me that the Union Government have not respected their own agreement regarding their treatment of British Indians. There has been a policy of progressive stringency in their anti-Asiatic drive. One had hoped that what is known as the Smuts-Gandhi Agreement of 1914 was the last word in this matter. It was also hoped that with virtual restriction of Indian immigration, there would be progressive amelioration in the condition of domiciled Indians. But that hope was dashed to pieces. Much deterioration has taken place since. There have been Round Table and other conferences, agreements have been reached, but never has any finality been felt by the Indians. Evidently the Union Government would not be happy till they have either driven away Indians whom they have given legislative protection or reduced their status to such an extent that no self-respecting Indian would care to remain in South Africa. I have therefore not discount-enanced their reported decision to fight this latest menace of segregation through civil resistance, if necessary. There must be perfect cohesion and union among the Indians who are divided into groups. And their resistance will be vain if they are not resolute in self-suffering. Public opinion in India including that of Europeans will, I hope, back the Indians in their unequal fight and call upon the Indian Government to exert its influence with the Union Government. Lastly, I appeal to the best mind of South Africa to see that simple justice is not denied to the Indian settlers who have done no wrong to the country of their adoption.libtech_774_footnote

So long as 	the hearts of both of you are pure and your association is 	exclusively for service, I see no necessity at all for you to give 	up Deo     	“Telegram 	to Tanzeem-ul-Mominin”, 19-5-1939

 477.	SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, RAJKOTlibtech_778_footnote
 May 23, 1939
 I have come here to give an account of myself. I want to render account not before the Parishad alone, but before all the people of Rajkot belonging to all groups.
 I came to Rajkot with no good thoughts about Mr. Virawala. I believed that the Thakore Saheb had broken his promise and from within I was prompted to undertake the fast. But my mind weakened and the very next day I wrote to the Viceroy for intervention. Now I see that it was an act of sin. Its outcome was the Award, and its consequences are known to you. As time went on, I realized my error and immediately renounced the Award.
 I believe I have opened a new page in the history of Rajkot by my repentance and by the frank admission of my failure. In this I require your help. I cannot go on single-handed. If the ruler and the ruled both join hands and do their duty, this apparent failure would turn into a victory. This necessitates unity among the people.
 Unity is the root of strength and progress. The Parishad must embrace and convert every section of the people. Some may not join hands with the Parishad owing to their weakness and others due to differences of opinion, even then they are with us.
 I want the Parishad people to realize the implications of ahimsa. Ahimsa trusts the opponent, ahimsa does not attribute motives, it harbours no evil thoughts as I did in the case of Durbar Shri Virawala. Whether he really answered to the description that was being given of him or not, was beside the point. I shamed my ahimsa by suspecting him; whereas if I wanted to convert him, my love for him should have
 
 
 increased every day. If I had to use harsh words for him, they should have been such as I might have used only for my father, mother, wife or son. And you behaved no better. The Parishad workers put no curbs on their tongue and indulged in unrestrained language. You have now to begin a new chapter. You must bid good-bye to this inclination to indulge in unrestrained language. You have to understand ahimsa as you have not understood it before. Ahimsa means that you have to trust those whom you have come to regard as untrustworthy. Unless you do so, you can never convert them.  Mahadev Desai and Mohanbhai who have been having daily talks with Durbar Shri Virawala tell me that his attitude has undergone a  complete change. Don’t tell me that this change may be only momentary. The momentary change may well become permanent some day. Ahimsa has no limits, and patience too has none. We lose nothing thereby. What I did lose was when I allowed my ahimsa or soul to be besmirched. I began the process of self-Purification by discarding the Award. That Process is still going on and it was for me but a step in the process to attend the Durbar.libtech_779_footnote
 If you want to follow me you must have the faith that you could enter into the heart of your adversary by ahimsa. If you are true and confident of yourself, you may not think ill of Mr. Virawala. If you do, your ahimsa is not perfect. I ask you to have trust in me who has been a devotee of ahimsa for over fifty years.
 Gandhiji referred to the anomaly of the State issuing another notification continuing the ban on the newspapers which he considered illegal and painful to the people. Gandhiji advised the people not to be disheartened over such matters. He asked them to stop reading papers which indulged in violent language, and advised them to boycott them if they embarrassed the cause by using such language, He also appealed to the press to refrain from writing anything which might increase bitterness. Gandhiji appealed to the State also to have faith in the good sense of the people. He added:
There is not a single person in the whole world who does not
 deserve our love. To achieve unity of soul is the greatest purushartha.libtech_780_footnoteI wish both the Ruler and the ruled in Rajkot may arrive at an understanding and thus become happy. I wish your administration to be such as to make it ideal. The late Thakore Sir Lakhajiraj has laid a
 
 strong foundation on which you can easily build an ideal structure.
 I hope the [Reforms] Committee would work on the basis of the Notification No. 50 of December last. As for me, I have laid down all my weapons. Hence I can only make a request. I advise the Parishad workers to give full co-operation to the Committee and place before  it their evidence and aspirations. I am still groping in the dark. I have not yet sufficiently found light. When I am fully enlightened I will place my programme before you and guide you, if you would want my guidance. Otherwise I will remain in my humble home.
 Gandhiji said that there must be some Muslims as well as Bhayats present at the meeting. They had said a lot of things and bitter, too, about him.
However, I would wish they would carry my message. What
brought me to Rajkot to make peace?
 Replying himself, he recalled that he was closely connected with Rajkot and its ruling family. He was brought up in Rajkot. His father had served as Dewan in the State and lastly he was closely connected with the late Thakore Sir Lakhajiraj who had considered him as his guru.

 478.	LETTER TO LORD LINLITHGOW
 ANAND BHUWAN, RAJKOT
 May [23 ]libtech_781_footnote/24 , 1939
 DEAR LORD LINLITHGOW,
I thank you for your letterlibtech_782_footnotelibtech_783_footnoteof 15th instant.
 Without wishing to enter into any controversy, I would like to say about Talcher that the whole of the evidence supplied by Shri Harekrushna Mahtab and enforced by Miss Agatha Harrison and others goes to show that, so far as the known facts go, there was the clearest possible belief that Major Hennessy was acting with authority. But whatever the fact may be, I hope that the poor ryots would not have to suffer long.
 But the main purpose of this is to tell you formally what you must have seen from my public statementlibtech_784_footnote, that I  was  obliged,  for conscience’s sake, to renounce the Gwyer Award. It took me some time to detect that I had erred in asking Mr. Gibsonlibtech_785_footnoteto send   you the
 
 
 wire of 4th March. And having detected the error, I took further time to summon courage enough to throw away the obvious advantages of the Award and all it meant. But at last I saw that even though I was acting for the public, I must discard a gain which from a moral point of view had appeared to me to be unlawful. Fast I have held too sacred a weapon to be used lightly. I betrayed unworthy weakness—a sure sign of violence—when instead of allowing the fast to run its course I invoked your assistance. From that moment it ceased to be a spiritual act. I would see nothing wrong in seeking your assistance if I was fighting along purely constitutional lines. Indeed the rich experiences I have gained during my travail show that if the Paramount Power is to do its legal duty it is bound to take a much more active part than it has hitherto taken about the rights of the ryots in the States. But this is by the way. My object just now is to apologize to you for all the trouble I caused you by my weakness. And may I ask you also to convey my apology to Sir Maurice Gwyer for the labours that he had to go through for delivering his Award? I know that the correct procedure for me was to let you have me recantation before the world knew anything about it. But I was having daily talks with Durbar Shri Virawala through Mahadev Desai. Every hour’s delay added to my agony. I was dying to put myself right with him. I could accept nothing until I had disengaged myself from what I have stigmatized as a double game. And then too there has been delay in sending you this apology as my dealing with the aftermath of the recantation with my weak body left me little time for composing this letter. I wanted some leisure for it. I stole it partly last night and the rest this morning.
 I am, Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

 Why did you fall ill? Take the medicine suggested in the letter which Sushila is writing to you. But make this change in it. What you are suffering from is not dysentery but an infection which you have
 contracted here.libtech_786_footnoteTo cure it you should live for some time only on fruit juices and glucose. The fruits should include pineapples, pomegranates, musambis, oranges and grapes. Take about 50 ounces of juice and 2 to 4 ounces glucose. If you do this you will be able to keep up your strength. If you cannot drink this quantity of juice, you may drink less. If you think that the quantity of glucose also is too much, take less. Put a mud-pack of clean earth on the abdomen at night, cover it up with a piece of dry cloth and then wrap a piece of khadi round it. Remove the khadi piece when you wake up at night.

            MY 	DEAR IDIOT,   LETTER TO AMRIT KAUR       RAJKOT,  May 	26, 1939 
  	Of course I will give you the time you may need for explaining all 	you wish. But you must cease grieving. Weeping and brooding over 	injustices done to oneself is no virtue, it is definitely a vice. It 	is better cheerfully to submit to injustices than even unwittingly 	to do any injustice to anyone.  	I forgot to tell you that P. was better after my severe talking to 	him. Only boundless love can cure him of his malady. I lack it. I 	lose patience with him as with no one. Have I ever told you that 	somehow or other I never spoke to Chhotelal or Pyarelal without 	losing temper? The wonder to me is that Ch. never resented my 	explosions. He is gone. I feel responsible for his suicide. My harsh 	treatment of P. when I discovered his love for Y. must be held to be 	unforgivable. Had I treated him sympathetically things would have 	taken a different turn. As it was, I had practically banished him to 	Orissa. My ahimsa failed me. But neither Ch. nor P. ever complained. 	On the contrary they read love in every act of mine. If Mahadev has 	time he must tell you what I mean. Love.  TYRANT  From 	the original: C. W. 3655. Courtesy: Amrit Kaur. Also G.

  	Can’t you improve the language of Janmabhoomi? If you 	accept the policy of ahimsa, it is very necessary that you should 	make  a conscious effort to change your language. If ahimsa is to 	find its way through the violence that is spreading all around, the 	newspapers which believe in ahimsa must transform themselves 	completely. Think over this. I don’t wish that you should do 	anything for my sake, but if you are sincerely convinced of what I 	am saying, make the change.

 Sushila thinks that you must get your private parts examined by a woman doctor. Without such examination it will not be possible to prescribe the right treatment. Get yourself examined, therefore. Do continue milk and fruit. It would be very nice if you come to Segaon when I return there. We shall be starting from here on the 1st. After staying there for three or four days, we shall go to the Frontier Province. Kanti is here, and of course Saraswati too. Amtul Salaam is in Ahmedabad. Ba’s health is all right and so is mine.

  	Your letter too seems thoughtless to me. There is anger in it also. 	There is arrogance given in your  manner of asking for forgiveness. 	But then how can you change your nature? Do you consider your 	marrying in this way a marriage? You are deceiving yourself by 	believing so. How many people you have hurt by your action you do 	not know, and you do not feel sorry for that. It seems even the 	sorrow you expressed before me was momentary. However one cannot 	swallow what one has spat out. If you would release me, I am ready 	to be released. I am sure you will continue to receive money 
 from Devdas. At present you get it through me. But it would suit me if he sends it directly to you. Your writing to me that I should forget you shows your impertinence. You know that I cannot forget you. Yes, the hopes which you had encouraged me to build on you seem to have been shattered. No matter how much you slight me, I will not cease to be your well-wisher. Wake up and shed your cruelty, be straightforward and humble, learn gentleness and get rid of the poison in you. Look upon all those who flatter you and please you by their sweet words as your enemies. You have hurt a good many people. Don’t pride yourself on having made Saraswati your slave.

  6.20 	a.m., May 28, 1939  MY 	DEAR IDIOT,  	This is the fourth letter I am writing without the break of a day.  	I can’t feel happy till I have convinced you that we are all 	authors of our own misery. If we have imbibed the first principle of 	ahimsa we must learn to put up even with real injustices from dear 	ones and that without grief. We do nothing strange when we require 	felt love. But our love becomes potent when we rejoicingly suffer 	felt injustice. This really resolves itself into what I started this 	letter  with,  that  justice and injustice have no existence apart 	from our feeling. I want you    
 therefore to imbibe this first lesson of ahimsa and assure me that there will be no more of weeping or harbouring secret and silent sorrow and grief. If you cannot learn this from me, you will learn nothing.
Love.

  TO PARSI FRIENDS 
 Parsi friends continue to favour me with their letters, some of which do not err on the side of politeness. Some are affectionate and so simple that they believe me to be capable of performing wonders. Among these writers there is one who writes with a lacerated heart and sends me cuttings which contain palpable falsehoods. He asks me to appeal to the Parsis with a view, at least to purging the opposition of indecency. The language used in the cuttings is not translatable. The families of those who have incurred their ill-will have not been left alone. Vulgarity is too mild a term for characterizing some of the writings. One writer uses language of violence which certainly brings him within penal laws. But the writers have no fear of the law. The writings before me are in fair sample of ‘civil’ liberty. I call these writings terrorism of minorities. One writer has given the prohibition campaign of communal turn and has not hesitated to say that Congress Hindus have plotted to ruin the Parsis !
 Surely abuse is no argument. Let the Parsis who are interested opposing prohibition carry on whatever agitation they like. But let it be decent, non-violent and within bounds.
 Must one hundred thousand Parsis hold up an overdue reform which promises to bring a ray of hope in the dungeons of the labouring population which far outnumbers the whole of the Parsi
 
 population? Every legitimate ground of complaint has been removed by Dr. Gilder. No Parsi whose health requires the use of spirituous liquors will be deprived of them. If Parsi religious rites really demand the use of the fiery liquid, they shall be supplied. Then there is the economic question. Many poor liquor dealers will be hard hit by the deprivation of their means of livelihood. I understand that  the Ministers are taxing themselves to devise some legitimate method of dealing with them. But it will surely be very difficult, if not impossible, for them to do anything, if the wild ferment is kept up and terrorism short of physical violence is applied. Not that the Ministers should not do justice because of terrorism, but it incapacitates them for taking effective action. For instance, it is necessary for the heads of the Parsi Panchayat to confer with the Ministers and in consultation with them think out a plan whereby prohibition in Bombay can be inaugurated with the least possible hardship.This can be done only if all parties recognize that prohibition has come to stay.
 My correspondents have asked me to use my influence with the Ministers for withdrawing their measure. They should know that I have my limitations. If I have any influence, it is due to my never crossing the boundary line. Let all concerned know that I have never interfered with the Congress Ministers although many of them have been and are my valued co-workers. Having withdrawn from the Congress, it would ill become me to interfere with their work. The very purpose of my withdrawal would be defeated. What is more, I am most interested in prohibition. No one in India perhaps knows its beneficial effect as well as I do and therefore no one feels its necessity as keenly as I do. I have seen with my own eyes people otherwise sane lying in the gutter. Having indentified myself with labour, I know what ruin drink has brought to the homes of labourers given to drink.  I know that they will not touch liquor if it was not within reach. We have contemporaneous evidence that drinkers themselves are in many cases asking for prohibition. Have I not my eldest son who was intelligent, brave, patriotic and capable of sacrifice, and who has been ruined by the drink habit and who is today lost to his parents and lost to society and exists on the misplaced charity of generous donors? This is not an exception. It is a typical case, as I can say from a knowledge of sons of persons in the so-called higher walks of life. As  I write these lines, illustrations of unimpeachable authenticity crowd on my memory. I can therefore only ask my Parsi correspondents and others like them in return to help the Ministers in their noble and
 philanthropic mission; for I feel convinced that whatever may be said for or against Congress Ministers about their popular measures, their prohibition programme, if they are able to put it through to the end, will go down to posterity as unquestionably the noblest measure of all. It is no vote-catching device. Prohibition is an integral part of the programme of national self-purification. Twice has it been demon- strated what was possible in the shape of closing of liquor shops even through voluntary efrort. Let the great Parsi community, men and women, discarding the unbecoming vituperation, rise to the occasion and help the great reform movement which, if it succeeds, will not only enrich India morally and materially but will serve as an impetus to similar effort in the Western world. Many eyes outside India are watching this experiment anxiously and prayerfully.
 I grant that many Parsis drink moderately and without any visible bad effect. That is an argument not for opposing prohibition but for ensuring that they get their drink if it is proved to be a medical necessity. They should be patriotic enough to recognize  that  as  against their limited experience is the universal exprience  of  the deadly effect of the drink habit.

 APPENDICES
 APPENDIX Ilibtech_793_footnote
 COLD-BLOODED BREACH OF A SOLEMN COVENANT
 Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel issued the following statement on January 25th:
 It is with the deepest regret that I have to announce resumption of the struggle in Rajkot which seemed to have ended so happily. Resumption has become a duty in order to vindicate the honour of the State and the self-respect of the people of Rajkot.
 The public will recall that the settlement announced in the Rajkot State Gazette of 26th December was a result of discussions between the Thakore Saheb and his Council consisting of Sir Patrick Cadell, Rao Saheb Maneklal Patel and Shri J. Jobanputra. The discussions which took place on the evening of December 25th lasted for nearly eight hours ending at 1.42 a.m. On the day of the settlement the Thakore Saheb gave me the following note:
 AMARSINHJI SECRETARIAT, RAJKOT STATE,
 December 26, 1938
 It is agreed that seven members of the Committee mentioned in Clause 2 of the State announcement of today’s date are to be recommended by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and they are to be nominated by us.
 (Sd.) DHARMENDRASINH THAKORE SAHEB, RAJKOT
 It should be remembered that I had gone to Rajkot at the Thakore Saheb’s invitation.
 Soon after the settlement Sir Patrick Cadell retired....
 I must state with the greatest reluctance that the Thakore Saheb has been ill served by those who have eaten his salt. Among the worst of these advisers has been Durbar Virawala who has ruined the State and drained it empty by his hopeless mismanagement. He has cast a spell over the Thakore Saheb which the latter cannot resist even if he would. It was he who brought Sir Patrick Cadell. When the latter realized that Durbar Virawala was the evil genius of the State, almost his first act was to have him banished from Rajkot with the help of the Agency. Sir Patrick Cadell might not have been obliged to leave if he had not traded upon his prestige as a member of the ruling race. Durbar Virawala would not brook the presence of a Dewan who had brought about his banishment.
 
 
 Though he was banished he pulled the wires from Bagasra. His son Bhojvala and his nephew Valeravala are still with the Thakore Saheb. Realizing that he could not successfully resist the contemplated settlement, he played the role of a friend and seemed to assist the settlement. Soon after the settlement, when Sir Patrick Cadell was about to go, Durbar Virawala found himself in Rajkot and began his operations which have never ceased. The Resident’s note and the Political Agent’s note will be read with interest.
 I needed a few days to enable me to select, in consultation with those who were  in charge of the movement, seven names of the committee that had to be given in terms of the settlement. I sent the following seven names on the 4th January:
 Shri 	Popatlal Dhanjibhai Malaviya Shri 	Popatlal Purushottam Anada Shri 	Mullan Valiji Abdulalli Dr. 	D. J. Gajjar Shri 	Jamnadas Khushalchand Gandhi Shri 	Vrajlal Mayashanker Shukla Shri 	Uchharangray Navalshanker Dhebar 
 Notification of the appointment of the committee should have followed at once. But nothing happened for some days.
 On the 28th December there was a consultation between the Resident and the Thakore Saheb-in-Council. I have authentic notes of that interview taken by one of those present. The remarks made by the Resident about the Congress and me will be read with interest. He could not conceal his dislike of the settlement, the Congress or me.
 It seems that the Resident and Durbar Virawala are responsible for the breach of the solemn undertaking the Thakore Saheb gave to his people As evidence of Durbar Virawala’s influence over the Thakore Saheb, the letter of thanks received by me from him makes interesting reading.
 It is necessary to compare the present one-sided arbitrary notification with the one which was issued in terms of the settlement. The second notification cancels four of my nominees. It also cancels the terms of reference and is vague, whereas the first was precise. The former contemplates publication of the report before the 31st instant and effect being given to it by the Thakore Saheb. The latter fixes no time-limit for the report.
 Before the last announcement I received a letter from Rao Saheb Maneklal Patel. It is noteworthy that whereas that letter had accepted four of my nominees the notification has only three. To this I sent a reply in Gujarati of which the translation will be found.
 I had heard so much of Durbar Virawala’s influence on the Thakore Saheb and his interference that I had to say in my said letter that Durbar Virawala could not in any event be accepted on the committee. I wanted no loophole left.
 This flagrant breach of a solemn settlement leaves but one course open before the people of Rajkot. It now remains for me to invite the people of Rajkot to resume the self-chosen course of suffering for vindicating their liberty and saving Rajkot and the Thakore Saheb from utter ruin. It is best to anticipate and provide for the worst. The worst that can happen is frightfulness of the extreme type, including torture not unknown in Kathiawar and setting up of internal quarrels. Of the latter we have evidence in inspired agitation from some Muslim brethren. We have to show them by our conduct that they have at least as much to gain as the rest of us by settled government under their own control. Rajkot has been made bankrupt  through hopeless mismanagement and corruption. These dissensions, if they persist, can prolong the struggle, never defeat the end in view, if the people at large cohere, show capacity for enduring suffering, no matter how great or protracted, and also show capacity, in spite of pecuniary losses, for going through the items of non-violent non-co-operation. On no account must students take part in civil disobedience or strikes. They can and should do constructive work if they believe in it. They can by house-to-house visits alleviate suffering which is bound to be inevitable as the struggle proceeds.
 Non-violence has to be observed in thought, word and deed. It has to be observed as well among co-workers as with opponents and neutrals, as well in the jail as outside it. The measure of our non-violence will be the measure of our success. We must have faith in the possibility of our non-violence turning the Thakore Saheb’s face in the direction of his people. Today he is a Ruler in name only; it must hurt every one of his people to find the young Prince committing a deliberate breach of the solemn covenant he made with his people.
 I have said seemingly bitter things about Durbar Virawala. But truth has to be sometimes bitter and harsh. I have said nothing that I do not believe about him. We must love him in spite of his glaring blemishes and expect our love to convert him and those who are working under his influence and direction.
 I am sorry the Resident resents my intervention and the influence of the Congress in shaping the policy and programme of the people of Rajkot. The people of the States have always been guided by the Congress. They owe allegiance to it. Indeed in the early stages the Princes also looked to the Congress for its support. The Congress adopted the policy of non-intervention in the sense of direct participation in the matters affecting questions arising between the people and the Princes. This was nothing but recognition of the limitations of the Congress. But when the people became conscious of their strength and were prepared to suffer, the Congress would be
 untrue to its mission if it failed to help them to the best of its ability. As for poor me    I happen to have been a President of the Kathiawar Rajkiya Parishad and as such owe a duty to the people of Kathiawar as also to the Princes and dare not refuse help when they need it. In Rajkot the people in the first instance and then the Ruler sought my assistance which I claim has been unstintingly given. I fail to see anything wrong in this or to be resented by the Resident or the Imperial Power. This is a question which  it would incidentally be Rajkot’s proud privilege to be the cause of having decided.
 For the time being the civil resistance will be confined to Kathiawaris only. The people of Kathiawar are so inter-related that for practical purposes it would be difficult to exclude any Kathiawari from participation on moral grounds.
 
 THAKORE SAHEB’S LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL

 RAJKOT STATE,

 MY DEAR SARDAR VALLABHBHAI,

 LETTER FROM SIR PATRICK CADELL TO THAKORE  SAHEB
 AMARSINHJI SECRETARIAT,
 RAJKOT,
 October 1, 1938
 YOUR HIGHNESS,
 I yesterday asked you to allow me to see you not later than 8 o’clock. I had affairs of great importance to talk about. I suggested this late hour though inconvenient to myself, in order to suit you. You sent your Private Secretary to tell me that you would see me at 8.30. I was present at that time and was told that you were  in your bath. I waited till 9 o’clock, and was told that you might be another quarter or half an hour late. I then left.
 I now write to inform Your Highness that I have no intention of allowing
 myself to be treated in this grossly discourteous manner. I had no idea when I left England to help you that you would be capable of such behaviour. I cannot allow it to be continued.
 I had intended to tell you last night that in any case the present situation cannot go on. The condition of affairs in the State is very serious. Many of the complaints against the State are based on your behaviour. It is believed that you spend too large a share of the State’s revenue, that most of your expenditure is on unworthy objects, and that you take no part in the administration of the State. I do not wish to make any reference at present either to the amount of money you spend, or the way you spend it. But it is certainly true that you take no part in the administration and show no interest in the welfare of your people. This is all the more noticed because it is so different from the system which your father followed. It is not fair to your officers to expect them to bear the burden of repressive methods while you  do nothing. You must take some share. I therefore propose to you the following action.
  I 	understand that 	you are to take 	part in the 	yajna ceremony 	at one, 	and perhaps 	two, of 	the temples 	this evening 	at 7.30. 	If there 	is time 	for you to agree 	to this, 	I request 	that after 	you have done this, 	you will drive 	through the city and that 	you will 	allow me to accompany you.  The 	Huzur Office is 	closed today as 	it is a holiday, 	but it 	is open on 	Monday. I 	suggest that 	you should promise on 	your word of 	honour to 	come to 	the office on Monday, not later than 6 p.m. to hear petitioners for about an hour. 
 I am sure that these two actions will have a good effect in the city.  I must also make a third request.
  Whenever 	I have 	to see you on any day, 	you will 	promise to see me on that 	day not later 	than 7.30 p.m. and you 	will promise on 	your word of 	honour not 	to be 	more than a quarter of an 	hour late. 
 If you are unable to accede to these suggestions, I shall be obliged to inform the Hon. the Resident that I cannot carry on and that 1 propose to return to England as soon as possible.
 If I have to do so, I fear that this may have unfortunate consequences both for your State and for yourself. I can assure you that the Government of India are not likely to look with favour on your conduct. I should be sorry if you were to suffer, but I cannot continue if Your Highness behaves like this.
 I should be obliged if you would let me know before 5.30 this evening whether
 
 Your Highness agrees to drive through the city this evening and to allow me to accompany you.
 Yours sincerely,
 PATRICK CADELL
 
 LETTER FROM THAKORE SAHEB TO SIR PATRICK CADELL
 Confidential	RANJIT VILAS PALACE,
 RAJKOT,
 October 2, 1938
 DEAR SIR PATRICK,
 I am exceedingly sorry to receive your letter of yesterday, and I must say that I do not like the tone of it. I cannot accept that the complaints against me are based on facts. The present agitation is only a wave spread by the Congress for the initiation of responsible government in the States, and I believe that to be the reason why they have selected Rajkot in Kathiawar, as they have done with Mysore, Travancore, etc., as States in which people already enjoy greater share of public liberties.
 It was with a view to put down the situation that I had requisitioned your services I have still a wish to smoothen your task as much as possible and will come  to the office any day at my convenience after Dasera.
 I strongly object to your remarks that if you have to go it  may  have unfortunate consequences both for my State and myself, and that the Government of India are not likely to look with favour on my conduct. In this connection I must definitely let you understand that it is I who has appointed you as my Dewan, and that if as a result of any disagreement with you I have to ask you to be relieved, neither the Hon. the Resident nor H. E. the Viceroy will have any cause to look upon me with disfavour. Whatever information you may be able to gather with regard to my State and myself is made available to you because you enjoy my confidence, and I need hardly say that you cannot utilize any of my State records without my permission, and much less against myself. Any information which the Hon. the Resident has thought it necessary to receive about anything relating to my State has been sought for through my Dewan, only if I am agreeable to give it. I might also tell you that I have done nothing to lose any share of the confidence which I enjoy both with the Hon. the Resident and H. E. the Viceroy to its fullest extent. I would therefore wish you to reconsider your decision and express your agreement to act in a manner consonant with my dignity and policy.
 Yours sincerely,
 DHARMENDRASINH
 LETTER FROM THAKORE SAHEB TO SIR PATRICK CADELL
 RAJKOT,
 October 16, 1938
 DEAR SIR PATRICK,
 You are, I am sure, fully aware of the present situation. It has not been improved in any way and so far as I can see it is getting worse every day and has reached a climax by now. The other day when we called a meeting we agreed to give the people certain concessions, but it failed to ease the situation and bring about any desired result. I am myself getting convinced that we failed to take proper steps at the proper time, which should have removed my anxiety. The situation, in short, is decidedly getting out of control and adding immensely to my troubles. The agitation  is getting more and more intense with little hope of its being brought under control in the near future. My people feel and are led to believe that you have been sent by the Government and that I have lost the position which I had hitherto enjoyed. They now refuse to extend to me the same love and loyalty which they used to extend before your arrival. Nay they even seem to think and carry the impression that not I but you are the Ruler.
 I should say that though this feeling is not created by you but I must say that anyway it is there which they are not in a mood to shake off obviously. Diwali holidays are drawing nearer and Ijaras must as usual be given but the people have boycotted them. They are further determined to boycott sales of grain also, and it is possible that no sale of grain could be made this year due to their non-co-operation. This would mean a financial ruination of the State and a crisis which had better be imagined than stated. This state of things, I feel, I, as the Ruler, am bound to prevent at any cost or sacrifice in the interests of the State and its subjects.
 The people, as you know, have now adopted a defiant attitude and are suffering.   I must, therefore, see that this unfortunate situation must be thoroughly eased and some sort of definite settlement should be arrived at between them and me at the earliest possible opportunity. I feel I am unable to do anything in this matter so long  as my people do not recognize me as their de facto Ruler. As a well-wisher of the State you would also wish and agree that such state of things should not be permitted to continue any more. It is therefore my bounden duty to see that I must have my position as the real and benevolent Ruler re-established in the eyes of my people, in order that I may be able to carry conviction and settle with them and win their love and confidence.
 I had asked D. S. Virawala to know your views in this matter. He tells me that he saw you on the 13th instant and you told him that in your view the fight should be
 
 continued as long as the State’s finances would permit and we should see whether they  or we would ultimately win.
 Besides, your letter dated 1st October 1938 gives me to understand that in so far as you are concerned you are definitely of the view that I am myself, more or less, the cause of these troubles. I have denied the charges by my reply. Considering the allegations made in your letter and your attitude, I have little doubt in my mind that we would not be able to pull on together in the interests of my State and its subjects and also my rights, dignity and position of the Ruler, as nobody realizes the extremely disastrous situation more than I do.
 It is my definite desire to myself settle the domestic dispute between my State and its subjects as early as possible and before the Diwali holidays. This would not, in my view, be possible unless we part at the earliest. This is a very unfortunate position and no one would be more sorry than myself, but it could not be helped as the interests of myself and my State are at stake. I need hardly assure you that it is not my desire to make your position awkward in any way, and hence I leave it to you to decide how you should arrange to leave and retire, as I am anxious to see that just as you came as a friend you should also part as a friend. I had engaged your services for six months certain and hence I am instructing the State Treasury to pay your salary accordingly. I am also instructing Mr. Bhat, the Revenue Secretary, to relieve you at your convenience.
 Yours sincerely,
 DHARMENDRASINH

 RAJKOT,

 D. O. No. C/134-38
 MY DEAR THAKORE SAHEB,
 
 You will remember that on the evening of October 16th you wrote to inform me that you desired to dispense with Sir Patrick Cadell’s services and you enclosed a copy of the letter which you already sent to him. On the following morning we had a discussion. I then strongly advised you to reconsider the matter and to refrain from taking a step which from every point of view must inevitably be very prejudicial to the interests of your State and yourself. I also pointed out that when, on August 25th, you wrote to me asking me to obtain the necessary sanction to Sir Patrick Cadell’s appointment, you stated very definitely that the appointment was to be for  a  minimum period of six months in the first instance. On this understanding I referred
 your request to the Political Secretary to His Excellency the Crown Representative’s approval of the proposal.
 I need not repeat here the views which I explained fully when we discussed the matter on October 17th and again on October 22nd. After our discussion on October 17th, as you are unwilling to accept the advice which I offered, I forwarded to the Political Secretary a copy of your letter of October 1 6th.
 When we met on October 22nd I told that I had been instructed to inform you that His Excellency the Crown Representative trusts that in the interests of your State and yourself you will lose no time in reversing the action taken by you. Since then I have been hoping to hear that you have accepted and acted upon this advice. As however I have received no intimation from you to this effect, I write to ask you kindly to let me know as soon as possible the action you have taken in the matter since I saw you on October 22nd.
 Yours sincerely,
 E. C. GIBSON

 Confidential	October 2, 1938
 MY DEAR MR. GIBSON,
 I am very thankful for your confidential D. O. C/134-38 dated 26th instant.
 In view of the desire of His Excellency the Crown Representative and your earnest advice and recommendation, I have decided to continue Sir Patrick Cadell in my service, although I maintain that the constitutional aspect of this question is in my favour.
 I am very anxious that proper steps should be taken as soon as possible and have decided to form a strong council consisting of Sir Patrick Cadell and two of my officers to carry on the State, so that peace and tranquillity and respect for law is properly maintained.
 At the time of my interview with you on the 17th instant you approved of my suggestion of forming a council. Accordingly I have decided to have one of the following members in charge of the departments shown against their names:
 Ist member and Vice-president: Sir Patrick Cadell: 1. Law and Justice, 2.
 Political, 3. Finance, 4. Police and 5. Praja Pratinidhi Sabha and Municipality.
 2nd member: Rao Saheb Maneklal C. Patel: 1. Finance, 2. Industries, 3.
 Revenue, 4. P. W. D. and 5. Bardashi.
 3rd Member: Mr. Jayantilal L. Jobanputra: 1. Medical, 2. Jail, 3. Education and 4. Stables and other unspecified departments.
 As regards the future steps to be taken to control the present situation, they will be decided by the council with my approval and in all other important questions the above procedure is to be adopted.
 I will issue detailed instruction hereafter. I think the formation of such a strong council will remove my anxiety about the present situation,  which  is increasing day by day.
 On hearing from you, I shall inform Sir Patrick Cadell accordingly. I am so sorry for the trouble I gave you in the matter.
Yours sincerely,
 DHARMENDRASINH

 November 25, 1938
 MY DEAR VIRAWALA,
 Thanks for your letter. I did hear when I returned to Rajkot this morning that you were here, and I must say that I was very much surprised to hear it. I should have thought that if Mr. Anantrai Pattani wanted to see you he could have asked you to go to Bhavnagar or could himself have gone to Natwarnagar which is, I believe, much nearer to Bhavnagar than Rajkot is. I cannot understand why he felt it incumbent on him to make this extraordinary request, and I certainly think that it is a pity that you complied with it after the advice I gave you. I can understand that you were reluctant to come here. These long journeys must be very bad for your health at a time when you require rest and quiet for recuperation after your long illness. I am glad that you are feeling better today, and I strongly advise you to take more care of your health in future.
  With 	kind regards,        VALA 	SHRI 	VIRA 	MULU,  TALUKDAR 	OF 	NATWARNAGAR, 	RAJKOT    Yours 	sincerely,  E. 	C. GIBSON

 DEAR VALA SHRI,
 Your personal letter of yesterday. I am sorry Col. Aspinall thought the journey had been trying to you, particularly as you told me you were feeling so unwell after it. I was naturally extremely surprised, after your assurances that you would see
 nobody in Rajkot pending a reply to my reference to the Hon. the Resident, to learn
 that you had been to the Palace.
 I can only assume that you will realize that, in your own interests, this was hardly wise, and that you will, pending your return to Natwarnagar, not again depart from the attitude you had offered to adopt, i. e., complete aloofness from local affairs and not to meet anybody.
 I trust that you have now completely rested and will not suffer from your return journey to Natwarnagar tomorrow.
 Yours sincerely,
 C. K. DALY

MY DEAR VALLABHBHAI PATEL.
 
I am very thankful to you for coming to Rajkot.
 I appreciate very much the way in which you helped me in ending the impasse.
 I think you are fully aware by now that Dewan Saheb Virabhai has been most loyal to me and my State. All along his career he has done his best for the good of my people.
 In safeguarding the interests of myself and my State he had to suffer also.
 Now I request you to do your best to remove any misunderstanding existing in the minds of my people against him.
 I shall feel very thankful for the same.

     EXTRACTS 	FROM NOTES OF TALKS AT THE RESIDENCY   December 	28, 1938  Present: 	The Hon. 	Mr. Gibson,  The 	Thakore Saheb,  Sir 	Patrick R. Cadell,	Members of the  Rao 	Saheb M. C. Patel,	State 	Council Mr. Jayantilal 	L. Jobanputra  The 	Hon. Mr. Gibson started by saying to the Thakore Saheb to the effect 	that the agreement made by him had stirred up all the Princes. He 	would like to know how Vallabhbhai Patel had come to Rajkot and 	whether he was invited by him.  THAKORE 	SAHEB: He had come of his 	own accord and asked for meeting me, and I had invited him to tea.  MR. 	GIBSON: Well, 	he is a very unreliable 	man. You 	know  that  the 	Government of India’s 	wishes were that no outside interference should be allowed. By 	settling with 	him, you 	have lost sympathies of 	your brother Princes 	and the 	Government. Although the 	Government of 	India do 	not mind what you do, you 	have erred 	in settling 	through Patel. Even 	amongst the 	Congress workers, Mr. 	Patel is 	the most 	untrustworthy. However, 	as it appears 	from the Notification, 	the wordings 	of the 	settlement are 	not so bad 	but for the words “widest 	possible powers” which 	are capable 	of any interpretation. 	It may mean 	that you will 	be reduced 	to a figurhead. 	On the 	strength of 	these words, 	they would demand 	full responsible 	government at the 	very start and you will find yourself in a very awkward situation.  THAKORE 	SAHEB: No, I have only 	appointed a committee.  MR. 	GIBSON: Yes, but who will 	appoint the members of the committee? And the report as received has 	to be given effect to.  THAKORE 	SAHEB: Well, Mr. 	Vallabhbhai Patel will suggest names.  MR. 	GIBSON: That is it. That 	means Congress workers, who will demand full responsible government 	in view of the words “widest possible powers”.  SIR 	PATRICK: How is Mr. Patel 	to suggest names? Are we to write to him?  THAKORE 	SAHEB: No, he will send 	names.  MR. 	GIBSON: In one of the 	clauses, you have agreed to give full effect to the 
 report. That is very bad. You have given up your cards.
 As regards the appointment of the President of the Reforms Committee, Mr.
 Gibson asked the Thakore Saheb as to who will be the President of the Committee.
 THAKORE SAHEB: Durbar Virawala.
 MR. GIBSON: No, he cannot come.
 THAKORE SAHEB: Why ? He will come after his leave period is over.
 MR. GIBSON: No. He is a talukdar. He cannot come. I would not let him come
  now.    THAKORE 	SAHEB: No. He can come 	after Sir Patrick has gone.  MR. 	GIBSON: That will be seen 	after Sir Patrick is gone.     RAJKOT 	GAZETTE NOTIFICATION  RAJKOT 	DARBARI 	GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY,  Saturday, 	January 21,  1939

 LETTER FROM MANEKLAL PATEL TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL
 Confidential	RANJIT VILAS,
 RAJKOT,
 January 12, 1939
 DEAR SARDAR SAHEB,
 I am desired by H. H. Thakore Saheb to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, recommending the seven names to be nominated by him to the proposed Reforms Committee.
 You must have learnt from  the  newspapers  that  the  names  suggested  by  you were already out by the time your letter was received by His Highness, He regrets that it should have been so, because such an exposure places you and His Highness in somewhat awkward position.
 While H. H. would very much wish to select all the names suggested by you, you would also appreciate that he cannot ignore the requests made by important classes of his subjects, and should see that the committee consists of such persons as would command the confidence of all important groups of his subjects. In fact, His Highness has received representations from the Bhayats and Muslim Council and a petition from the Depressed Class, and has therefore desired me to write to you as under.
 While here, you very rightly said to H. H. that you did not know who the real leaders were and therefore postponed suggesting names until after you had consulted others.
 His Highness approves of the gentlemen numbered 1, 2, 4 and 5.
 While number three owns immovable property and resides here since about 40 years and is a respectable citizen, he could hardly be expected to be useful with independent opinion to work on a committee of this nature.
 You would agree that the Mahomedans form a very important unit and are now too well organized to be ignored so lightly. In their representation submitted as a result of the unanimous resolution of the Muslim Council, they have requested that three out of seven should be Mahomedans. This demand of theirs is of course unreasonable, but including the Bohras they should be given two seats and the President of their Council should be one of them. In view of your vast experience in British India, you will appreciate that if their legitimate request were not met, they may make a row and may create unhealthy atmosphere, which we all wish to avoid. There is no doubt that we all want a committee which would represent all sections of
 the people, be impartial and work harmoniously and with sagacity.
 As regards numbers six and seven, it appears that they would not come strictly within the scope of the definition of the “subject” as referred to in the notification.
 Mr. V. M. Shukla was neither born in the State nor has he been staying within the jurisdiction of the State since his birth for as many as about forty years. Possession by his ancestors of some property in Sardhar Pati does not entitle him, according to the definition, to be considered as a Rajkot State subject. He is neither born, nor domiciled, nor naturalized in the State.
 As regards Mr. U. N. Dhebar, His Highness feels that the same objection would come in the way. As is understood, he originally belongs to the Jamnagar State and his father spent the major portion of his life in Bombay. He himself is said to have received his schooling in Rajkot and was residing in the Civil Station when he started practice as a pleader. He has been living within the State limits since about two years. He has also purchased land in the State last year. His Highness feels that he should restrict his nomination to the definition, so as not to create any ill-feeling amongst other leading gentlemen, who have always been recognized by the State, since the time of the late Thakore Saheb, as leaders of the public.
 It may also be brought to your notice that the Bhayats have also approached His Highness, and very rightly,with a request that at least one of them should be on the committee, as they represent a very important and considerable unit in the State. His Highness therefore considers it essential that one of them should be on the committee.
 It is His Highness’s wish, as you will readily understand, that the committee should consist of the best brains who would also be representative of all important classes of his subjects.
 If any suggestions are to be made in the light of what has been said above, His Highness will then declare the personnel of the committee,  inclusive  of  three officials besides the President of the committee.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. C. PATEL
 
 LETTER FROM VALLABHBHAI PATEL TO MANEKLAL PATEL
 CAMP, BARDOLI,
 January 15, 1939
 DEAR SHRI MANEKLAL PATEL,
 I have your letter of the 12th instant. It has pained me. It is indeed regrettable that the names I proposed were published, but it is not always possible to keep
 
 anything private in which a number of persons are concerned. And then in spite of publication, alteration can certainly be made therein if there are valid reasons.
 I am afraid I cannot accept your recommendation regarding the names of Bhayats and Mussalmans on the committee. There was a definite intelligible object behind the settlement entitling me to suggest the names. That object would be frustrated if I were to accept your recommendation. The names have been suggested to achieve the object which can be fulfilled only by having on the committee men of integrity holding particular views. The seven members whose names I have suggested will surely bear in mind the interests of Bhayats and others. More than this may not be expected.
 I regret you have seen fit to object to certain names on the ground of their not being State subjects. But you have a right to do so; If on further consideration you should adhere to the view that Shri Dhebazbhai does not come within the definition, rather than argue with you I am prepared to withdraw his name and to suggest instead the name of Shri Gajanan Joshi Vakil. I maintain that Shri Vajubhai Shukla comes within the definition.
 H. H. the Thakore Saheb’s notification can only mean that the chairman of the committee had to be from the committee of ten, and I must say that Darbar Virawala may not be appointed chairman. He has sent me word that he does not intend to hold any office, but in order to avoid any possible accident I have thought it proper to mention this.
 I cannot help saying that the appointment of the committee has been greatly delayed. Their report has got to be published by the 31st January. I therefore hope that the committee will be appointed immediately on receipt of this letter. If unfortunately the appointment continues to be delayed, there is every fear of the struggle being resumed by the people. I must also add that I have in my possession copies of correspondence that has taken place between H. H. the Thakore Saheb and Sir Patrick Cadell, and of the summary of an interview with the Resident. If the settlement breaks down, I am afraid it will be my duty to publish, in public interest, these and other documents in my possession. But I hope I may have to do nothing of the kind, and the committee will be appointed and begin work immediately.
 May I expect a wire from you in reply?
 Yours sincerely, VALLABHBHAI PATEL

 GOVERNMENT OF INDIA’S STATEMENT ON RAJKOTlibtech_794_footnote
 NEW DELHI,
 February  1, 1939
  Attention 	has been drawn 	to Mr. 	Gandhi’s statement to 	the Press 	in regard 	to the recent events in the Rajkot and Jaipur States.  In 	the case 	of Rajkot, 	Mr. Gandhi 	states that “an 	honourable understanding 	arrived at between 	the Thakore 	Saheb-in-Council and 	Sardar Patel, 	representing the people, 	has been 	undone by the 	Resident”, and 	he expresses 	the opinion 	that “it 	is the duty of the Viceroy to ask the Resident in Rajkot to restore the pact.”  The 	facts are 	that the 	Thakore Saheb-in-Council 	reached an agreement 	with Sardar 	Patel that a 	committee should 	be appointed to 	investigate and 	make recommendations for 	constitutional reform. 	The terms of this 	agreement  were published 	on December 26, 	in the State Gazette. 	The number of official  	and non-official 	members who were to serve 	on the committee were 	stated in this 	announcement. No 	further indication was 	given as 	to the committee’s 	composition or the 	basis of 	its selection. 	It appears 	that simultaneously 	a private 	exchange of letters 	took place between the 	Thakore Saheb personally 	and Sardar 	Patel, to which 	no publicity 	was given. 	In this 	correspondence, the 	Thakore Saheb wrote to 	Sardar Patel 	as follows: 
 AMARSINHJI SECRETARIAT,
 RAJKOT STATE,
 26-12-‘38
 It is agreed that seven members of the Committee mentioned in Clause 2 of the State Announcement of today’s date are to be recommended by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and they are to be nominated by us.
 (Sd.) DHARMENDRASINH,
 Thakore Saheb, Rajkot The Thakore Saheb claims that this letter was intended to leave him at liberty
 to accept or not the names put forward by Sardar Patel. Sardar Patel contends that its
 intention was to bind the Thakore Saheb to accept whatever names he put forward.
 REFORMS COMMITTEE PERSONNEL
 Of the names put forward by Sardar Patel, the Thakore Saheb accepted three. In
 
 
 the interests of securing adequate representation for the Mohammedans and the Bhayats in the State, both of which parties submitted their claims to be represented, he found himself unable to accept the remaining four names. On his instructions, his Minister so informed Sardar Patel. Sardar Patel, however, in his reply, did not address himself to the merits and refused to acquiesce in the Thakore Saheb’s proposals for the representation of the interests mentioned above, and merely intimated that he would be content with nothing less than the names which he had put forward irrespective of the considerations advanced by the Thakore Saheb, in acting as he has acted of his own free will. The Resident has no knowledge of the correspondence which had passed and was not a party to it.
 Mr. Gandhi’s suggestion is that the Thakore Saheb should now be required to accept a different construction which Sardar Patel has placed on his letter. It would clearly be most improper to bring pressure on the Thakore Saheb to accept a construction which he evidently did not intend and is not now prepared to accept.
 Mr. Gandhi states that the Resident is reported to be resorting to “organized goondaism”. Mr. Gandhi has not indicated the source of this report, which has no foundation whatever in fact.
 In the case of Jaipur, the Jaipur Government will no doubt issue whatever statement they see fit in answer to Mr. Gandhi’s observations.

 DEAR SUBHAS,
 We were all deeply pained to hear of your illness. It was not to be thought that you should come to Wardha at the risk of your health. We hope that you will be soon restored to complete health.
 We have thought over the recent events carefully and have also read your various statements in connection with the Presidential election. Your unfortunate illness and the consequent cancellation of our meeting deter us from expressing our views on your statements.
 It should be sufficient at this stage for us to say that we, the undersigned, feel  it our duty to tender our resignations as members of the Working Committee, and we
 
 hereby tender the same. We feel [sic] to choose your Cabinet that represents your views.
 We feel that the time has come when the country should have a clearcut policy, not based on compromise between different and incompatible groups  of  the Congress.
 It is but right, therefore, that you should select a homogeneous Cabinet representing the views of the majority. You may trust us to give you all possible co-operation in matters where we see eye to eye with you in the policies that you may put before the country. In order to allay public suspense, we are sending this letter to the Press.

 APPENDIX IV
 
 STATEMENT OF SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSElibtech_797_footnote
 
 I have read the statement of Mahatma Gandhi on the recent presidential election with all the attention that it deserves. It grieves me to find that Mahatma Gandhi has taken it as a personal defeat. I would respectfully differ from him on this point. The voters, that is the delegates, were not called upon to vote for or against Mahatma Gandhi. Consequently the result of the contest does not in my view and in the view of most people affect him personally.
 
 Much has been said in the Press during the last few days about the Right and Left wings in the Congress. Several persons have interpreted the result of the election as a victory for the Leftists. The fact is that I placed before the public two main issues, namely, the fight against Federation and free and unfettered choice for the delegates in the matter of choosing their president. These issues must have greatly influenced the voting, and over and above these, the personality of the candidates might have had some effect. In the circumstances, I feel that while analysing the significance of the election we should not draw on our imagination nor should we read into it more than it contains.
 Assuming for argument’s sake that the result of the election implies a victory of the Left, we should stop to consider what the Leftists’ programme is. For the immediate future the Leftists stand for national unity and unrelenting opposition to the Federal scheme. In addition to this, they stand for democratic principles. Leftists will not take the responsibility of creating a split within the Congress. If a split does come, it will come not because of them, but in spite of them.
 Personally I am definitely of the opinion that there is neither reason nor justification for a split within the ranks of the Congress. I, therefore, earnestly hope that there will be no occasion now or in the near future for the so-called minority party to non-co-operate with the so-called majority party. I need hardly add that I shall try till the last to avert a split whenever any such likelihood appears before us.
 A certain amount of apprehension has been caused in the minds of many as to the policy which people like myself will follow in future. Let me make it quite clear that there will be no violent break with the past in the parliamentary or in the extra-parliamentary sphere. So far as the parliamentary programme is concerned, we shall only try to implement our election pledges and our parliamentary programme with greater speed than in the past. In the extra-parliamentary sphere, we shall endeavour to rally all our strength and resources for combating Federation and for pushing on towards purna swaraj. And we shall, of course, act in accordance with the principles and policy of the Indian National Congress.
 In this connection I should also like to say that I have on some occasions felt constrained to differ from Mahatma Gandhi on public questions, but I yield to none in my respect for his personality. If I have understood him correctly, he too would like to see people think for themselves, even though they may not always agree with him.  I do not know what sort of opinion Mahatmaji has of myself. But, whatever his view may be, it will always be my aim and object to try and win his confidence for the simple reason that it will be a tragic thing for me if I succeed in winning the confidence of other people but fail to win the confidence of India’s greatest man.

 SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI’S COMMENTS ON GANDHIJI’S DESCRIPTION OF HIS STATE OF MINDlibtech_798_footnote
 The Maharshi referred to the following passage of Gandhiji’s in the Harijan of the 11th instant:
 “How mysterious are the ways of God ! This journey to Rajkot is a wonder even to me. Why am I going, whither am I going? What for? I have thought nothing about these things. And if God guides me, what should I think, why should I think? Even thought may be an obstacle in the way of His guidance.
 “The fact is, it takes no effort to stop thinking. The thoughts do not come. Indeed there is no vacuum—but I mean to say that there is no thought about the mission.”
 He remarked how true the words were and emphasized each statement in the extract. Then He cited Thayumanavar in support of the state which is free from thoughts:
 “Bliss will reveal itself if one is still. Why then is this illusory yoga practice
 ? Can it (i. e., bliss) be revealed by directing the intellect in a particular way?”
 D. Is not what Gandhiji describes the state in which thoughts themselves become foreign?
 M. Yes. It is only after the rise of the ‘I’ thought that all other thoughts arise. The world is seen after you have felt “I am”. The ‘I’ thought and all other thoughts had vanished for him.
 D. Then the body-sense must be absent in that state.
 M. The body-sense also is a thought whereas he describes the state in which “thoughts do not come”.
 D. He also says, “It takes no effort to stop thinking”.
 M. Of course no effort is necessary to stop thought whereas one is necessary for bringing about thoughts....
 D. Gandhiji adhered to Satya (Truth) so long and won realization of the Self.
 M. What is Satya except the Self ? Satya is that which is made up of sat. Again
 sat is nothing but the Self. So Gandhiji’s Satya is only the Self....
 The Upanishadic Text is the eternal Truth to which everyone who has realized owes his experience. After hearing the Self to be the Brahman the person finds the true import of the Self and reverts to it whenever he is diverted from it. Here is the whole process of Realization.

 AMARSINHJI  SECRETARIAT
 RAJKOT  STATE
 March  3, 1939
 MY DEAR MAHATMA GANDHIJI,
 I received your letter yesterday and noted the contents with greatest regret. As you have already been assured that the Notification No. 50 which I published on 26th December will stand good, the suggestions you make regarding personnel of the Committee are not in accordance with the terms of that Notification, and I do not feel justified in accepting them or your other suggestions. The responsibility of ensuring that the Committee shall consist of suitable members truly representative of various interests of the State rests on me as Ruler of Rajkot, and it is a responsibility of which I cannot divest myself. In the best interests of my State and my people it is impossible for me to allow anyone else to have the final decision in a matter of such vital importance. As I have previously assured, it is my earnest hope that the Committee may be able to start work in a calm atmosphere at the earliest possible moment so that there may be no delay in introducing such reforms as may be found to be necessary

          DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  LETTER FROM E. 	C. GIBSONlibtech_800_footnote  THE 	RESIDENCY, RAJKOT,  March 	6, 1939 
  I 	telegraphed what you wrote in your letter of March 4th to His 	Excellency the Viceroy and have now been instructed to convey the 	following message from His Excellency to you:     
 I was very glad to receive your message today and am sorry indeed that you did not communicate with me before taking your present decision. The two points which, from the papers you sent me, I thought you were principally interested in were
 alleged 	misconduct by police, etc., alleged 	breach of undertaking by Thakore Saheb of Rajkot. 
 I trust that your own investigations satisfied you that there is nothing material under the first head. As regards the second, which is, I gather, now your chief difficulty, you will, I am sure, be glad to know that the Thakore Saheb has [to] preside over the Committee. That I will  readily arrange, and it will, I take it, meet what I have  no doubt is your chief anxiety, viz., to ensure fair play in the fulfilment of the Thakore Saheb’s Notification of December 26th. But in any case I should like myself to talk things over with you as soon as possible and I hope, therefore, that you will come and see me as soon as may be convenient to yourself.
 I expect to arrive in Delhi on the morning of Monday the 6th, and will be very glad to see you at any time after that if you will let me know. I hope myself that through personal discussion between us such misunderstanding as may exist will admit of being cleared; and on personal grounds, too, I should greatly deplore any decision on your part, as arising out of such misunderstanding, to continue a fast which cannot but be a great strain on you.

  I 	wired your reply to the Viceroy yesterday and am now instructed to 	convey the following message to you from His Excellency:  Thank 	you very much for your message 	which I 	have just received. 	I understand 	your position. 	It is clear 	from what you tell me 	that what counts 	with you 	essentially in 	this matter is 	your feeling that there 	has been 	a breach 	of faith. I 	realize that 	doubts may 	be entertained 	as to the 	meaning which 	should be 	attached to 	the Thakore 	Saheb’s Notification, as 	amplified by 	his subsequent letter to Sardar Patel, and it seems to me that the best way in which    
 these doubts can be resolved is to refer their interpretation to the highest judicial authority in the land, that is to say, the Chief Justice of India. I would, therefore, propose with the consent of the Thakore Saheb, which I understand is forthcoming, to consult this high authority as to the manner in which the Committee should be composed in accordance with the terms of the  Notification and the Thakore Saheb’s letter referred to above. After this the Committee would be set up accordingly and it would further be provided that should any difference subsequently arise between the members of  the Committee as to the meaning of any part of the Notification on which they were to make their recommendations, this question would also be referred to the same high authority whose decision would be final. I fully believe that this, combined with the Thakore Saheb’s assurance that he will carry out the promise contained in his Notification, and with my own assurance that I will exert my influence to see that he does so, will be sufficient to allay any apprehensions which have assailed you and that you will join with me in feeling that every precaution has been taken to ensure fair dealing and that you will allay the anxiety of your friends by abandoning any further strain upon your health. As I have already told you I shall be very glad to see you here and discuss matters with you so that any misapprehensions may be removed.

 DISCUSSION WITH AGATHA HARRISONlibtech_802_footnote
 
March 5, 1939
 I  raised the question of “next steps” and asked what was being done to explore  a way out of the impasse. Since the correspondence that was passed between the parties concerned, it would appear that nothing was being done officially—the general opinion being that any move now must come from Delhi.
 In answering, Gandhiji took up the question of the Sardar. He said if there was definite proof given to him by an impartial enquiry that the Sardar had employed dishonourable means to obtain the Thakore Saheb’s consent to the agreement he would repudiate the Sardar and drop his demands. He spoke of the character of the
 
 Sardar and said he was not a diplomat and was often misunderstood. We then dropped this matter and went on to the main question of the conditions that would enable him to break his fast.
 I asked Gandhiji if Zetland’s statement in England and the Viceroy’s here changed the situation in any way. If in view of these statements the Paramount Power undertook responsibility for seeing the agreement was implemented, and appointed a Committee without reference to the Present controversy on personnel, would this satisfy him?
 Gandhiji said “Yes”; if the Paramount Power gave the assurance that they would see he got the constitution in terms of the December 26th Notification and selected a Committee he could accept, he would not insist on the personnel named in his letter to Thakore Saheb. But this assurance would have to be given publicly and in writing.
 Alternatively, Gandhiji suggested that he would, with a nominee  of  the Thakore Saheb’s choice, who was trusted and respected, undertake to draft a constitution. If any points of difference arose they could be referred to an umpire.
 I asked Gandhiji if, in the event of some move being made as above, he would drop the point he made in his letter to Gibson yesterday for the removal of Virawala. He replied this was possible, if the Paramount Power made itself hostage, not only for the production of the constitution in terms of the December 26th agreement, but also that the recommendations of the Committee would be carried out in full.

 LETTER FROM S. SATYAMURTI TO MAHADEV DESAIlibtech_803_footnote
 NEW  DELHI,
 March  20, 1939
 MY DEAR MAHADEO,
 I told Mahatmaji that I would send him a note on the amendments to the Congress constitution. I am sending that note herewith. I also want that, on the lines we discussed this matter when we last met at Birla House, you should place before Mahatmaji my views on the urgent and important need of the anti-Hindustani agitation in Madras being met by the Government of Madras. I recognize that the agitation is factitious, is unreal in the sense in which it is fighting for something which it need not fight for and is being exploited by unscrupulous persons against the Ministry. At the same time, I am of the opinion, which you expressed in the columns of the Harijan, that from the point of view of truth and non-violence compulsion in
 
 
 any matter of this kind might well be postponed for the present, and till public opinion is more universally in favour of it. If a conscience clause were granted, I am sure that not more than ten percent will take advantage of it, and only in some districts, and that ten percent may be soon reduced to one percent by continuous and vigorous propaganda. As a matter of fact, the Madras Government have made a concession in that students taking up Hindi are not compelled to sit for  an examination. This, I think, practically takes away the value of compulsion; rather I would insist on an examination passing which will alone enable a student to be promoted to a higher class, and we may give this conscience clause.
 Moreover I do not like the use of the Criminal Law Amendment Actlibtech_804_footnotein view of
 our definite election pledge that the Congress stands for the repeal of all repressive laws. This Act was placed on the Statute Book by the fiat of the Governor-General against the express wishes of the Indian Legislative Assembly. This matter is very urgent, and I should like you to place it before Mahatmaji before he leaves Delhi. If he wants to discuss it further with me, I shall be glad to discuss it with him.
 There is just one other matter of extreme urgency which I am sure is already exercising Mahatmaji’s mind. The present deadlock in the Congress ought not to be allowed to continue. The Working Committee must be formed and formed at once. There are several provinces in which the Congress work is at a standstill and the Working Committee starting functioning alone will solve all these provincial and other problems. I hope that Mahatmaji will be able to get Srijut Subhas Chandra Bose to nominate the members of the Working Committee according to his wishes. But if there be any difficulty in the matter, I suggest that a very early meeting of the All- India Congress Committee may be summoned, which according to the constitution is entitled to meet the new situation and will meet it by appointing a  Working  Committee recommended by Mahatmaji.
 I am sending you this letter just now and I shall be at Birla House this evening (Monday, 20th) at 6.30 p. m. Any other hour between 5.30 and 8 p. m. will suit me. Please send a line in reply per bearer who will wait for the same, to meet you and have    a few words with you. I trust you will find it possible to meet me at that time.
 With kind regards,
 Yours very sincerely,

 APPENDICES XI
 LETTERS FROM SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSElibtech_805_footnote
 JEALGORA  P. O.,
 March  29, 1939
 MY DEAR MAHATMAJI,
 I received your letter of the 24th instant from the train, along with the enclosures.
 Firstly, my brother, Sarat, wrote to you on his own. You will see from his letter that he got your telegram on his return to Calcutta from here and then he wrote to you. If he had not got your telegram, I doubt if he would have written.
 There are, of course, certain things in his letter which echo my feelings. But
 that is a different matter. The main problem appears to me as to whether both parties can forget the past and work together. That depends entirely on you. If you can command the confidence of both parties by taking up a truly non-partisan attitude, then you can save the Congress and restore national unity.
 I am temperamentally not a vindictive person and I do not nurse grievances. In a way, I have the mentality of a boxer, that is, to shake hands smilingly when the boxing-bout is over and take the result in a sporting spirit.
 Secondly, in spite of all the representations that I have been receiving, I take the Pant resolution  as it has been passed by  the Congress. We must give effect to it.   I myself allowed the resolution to be moved and discussed, despite the ultra vires clause in it. How can I go back on it ?
 Thirdly, there are two alternatives before you: (1) Either to accommodate our views with regard to the composition of the new Working Committee, or (2) to insist on your views in  their entirety. In the case of the latter, we may come to the parting  of the ways.
 Fourthly, I am prepared to do all that is humanly possible for me to expedite the formation of the new Working Committee and the summoning of the Working Committee and A. I. C. C. But I am so sorry that it is not possible for me to come to Delhi now. (Dr. Sunil has wired to you this morning on this point. I got your telegram only yesterday.)
 Fifthly, I was surprised to learn from your letter that the A. I. C. C. office had not sent you a copy of Pant’s resolution. (This has since been done.) I was still more surprised that the resolution had not been brought to your notice till you came to Allahabad. At Tripuri, the air was thick with the rumour that the resolution had your fullest support. A statement to that effect also appeared in the daily Press while we were at Tripuri.
 
 
 Sixthly, I have not the slightest desire to stick to office, but I do not see any reason for resigning because I am ill. No President resigned when he was in prison for instance; I may tell you that great pressure is being brought to bear on me to resign. I am resisting because my resignation will mean a new phase in Congress politics which I want to avoid till the last. I have been attending to urgent A. I. C. C. work during the last few days.
 I shall write to you again tomorrow or the day after.
 I am progressing. I hope your blood-pressure will soon be down again. With pranams,
      PS.  Yours 	affectionately,  SUBHAS   This 	letter is not exactly a reply to yours, I have just jotted down the 	points 
  which 	were in my mind and which I wanted to convey to you. MAHATMA 	GANDHI  BIRLA 	HOUSE 	NEW 	DELHI      MY DEAR MAHATMAJI,           JEALGORA  March 31 
  I 	saw your telegramlibtech_806_footnoteto Sunil which you 	sent in reply to his long telegram regarding my health. When you 	wired suggesting my going to Delhi, I thought it best to let the 	doctors speak out their mind on the subject. So Sunil wired you.  I 	have been pondering 	over the 	various points in 	your letter 	of the 	24th instant 	to me (from 	the train) 	and your letter 	to Sarat 	of the 	same date and over the 	situation in 	general. It 	is really unfortunate for 	me that I 	fell ill 	at such a 	critical time. 	But events have 	so moved 	in rapid 	succession that I 	have not had a 	chance of 	quick recovery. 	Besides, both before 	Tripuri and 	after, I 	have not 	been treated 	in certain 	influential quarters 	(there is no reference 	to you 	at all 	in this—let 	me make 	it clear) 	with the 	consideration that was 	due to me. 	But there is 	no reason for 	me to resign 	on account 	of my illness. 	As I stated 	in my letterlibtech_807_footnoteof yesterday 	(my second 	letter to you), 	no President, 	to my knowledge, 	resigned when he was in 	prison, even for 	a long time. It may 	be that 	I shall 	have to 	resign after all, 	but if that 	takes place, it 	will be 	due to 	quite different reasons.  I 	think I said in my second letter that though pressure was being 	brought to bear on me to resign, I was resisting. My resignation 	would mean the beginning of a new phase in Congress politics which I 	want to avoid till the last . If we come to the     
 parting of the ways, a bitter civil war will commence and—whatever be the upshot of it—the Congress will be weakened for some time to come and the benefit will be reaped by the British Government. It is in your hands to save the Congress and the country from the calamity. People who are bitterly opposed for various reasons to Sardar Patel and his group, still have confidence in you and believe that you can take a dispassionate and non-partisan view of things. To them you are a national figure— above parties and groups—and you can, therefore, restore unity between the warring elements. If for any reason that confidence is shaken—which God forbid—and you are regarded as a partisan, then God help us and the Congress.
 There is no doubt that there is today a wide gulf between the two parties (or blocs) in the Congress. But the gulf can yet be bridged—and that by you. I cannot say anything about the mentality of our political opponents. Tripuri has given us a very bad experience of them, but I can speak for our side. We are not vindictive and we do not nurse grievances. We are prepared to “forgive and forget”—as they say—and join hands once again for the sake of the common cause, viz., the political and economic emancipation of India. When I talk of ‘our side’, I exclude the official Congress Socialist Party. We discovered for the first time at Tripuri what a small following the official Congress Socialist Party had. The Congress Socialist Party has now split—the rank and file and several provincial branches having revolted against the official leaders, because of what is called their vacillating policy. A large section of the Congress Socialist Party will move with us in future, in spite of what the top leadership may do. If you have any doubts on this score, you have only to wait and see.
 The letter of my brother Sarat to you shows that he is feeling very bitter. This
 I presume, is due largely to his experiences at Tripuri, because he had no such feeling when he left Calcutta for Tripuri. Naturally, he knows more about the happenings at Tripuri than I do, because he could move about freely, meet people and obtain information. But though I was confined to bed, I got enough information from several independent sources regarding the attitude of responsible circles politically opposed to us, to make me feel thoroughly sick of the whole affair. I may say further that when   I left Tripuri, I felt such a loathing and disgust for Congress politics as I have not done for the last nineteen years. Thank God, I have got over that feeling now and have recovered my composure.
 Jawahar in one of his letters (and possibly Press statements) remarked that the
 A. I. C. C. office had deteriorated under my presidentship. I resent that remark as unfair and unjust. He did not perhaps realize that in trying to damn me, he has damned Kripalaniji and the entire staff. The office is in the hands of the Secretary and his staff and if it deteriorates, it is they who are responsible for it. I am writing to Jawahar at length on this point. I am mentioning this to you because you have said something
 about the interim administration in your letter to Sarat. The only way in which we can help the office is to appoint a permanent Secretary at once, even if there is delay in appointing the rest of the Working Committee. But if the Working Committee is going to be appointed soon, we need not appoint the General Secretary in advance.
 I shall be grateful if you could let me know your reaction to Pant's resolution. You are in this advantageous position, that you can take a dispassionate view of things provided, of course, you get to know the whole story of Tripuri. Judging from the papers, most of the people who have seen you so far seem to belong to one school—namely, those who supported Pant's resolution. But that does not matter. You can easily assess things at their proper value, regardless of the persons who visit you. You can easily imagine my own view of Pant's resolution. But my personal feelings do not matter to public considerations. As I have said in a previous letter, whatever one may think of Pant's resolution from the purely constitutional point of view, since it has been passed by the Congress I feel bound by it. Now, do you regard that resolution as one of no-confidence in me and do you feel that I should resign in consequence thereof? Your view in this matter will influence me considerably.
 Perhaps, you are aware that at Tripuri it was given out by those who were canvassing in support of Pant's resolution that telephonic conversation had taken place with Rajkot and that resolution had your full support. A report to that effect appeared in the daily Press also. It was further given out in private conversation that nothing short of that resolution in its entirety would satisfy either you or your orthodox followers. Personally, I did not and do not believe in such reports, but they undoubtedly had their vote-catching value. When Pant's resolution was shown to me for the first time by Sardar Patel, I suggested to him (Rajen Babu and Maulana Azad were also there at the time) that if certain changes were made, the resolution in the amended form would be passed by the Congress unanimously. The amended form of the resolution was also sent to Sardar Patel, but there was no response from his side. Their attitude seemed to be not a word, not a comma, should be changed. I suppose Rajkumari Amrit Kaur has handed over to you the amended form of the resolution. If the object of Pant's resolution was to reiterate faith in your principles and your leadership and guidance, that was provided in the amended resolution, but if the object was to avenge the result of the presidential election, then of course the amended resolution did not suffice. Personally, I do not see how Pant's resolution has enhanced your prestige, influence and authority. One hundred and thirty-five votes were cast against you in the Subjects Committee, and in the Open Session, whatever interested parties may say, my information from various independent sources is to the effect that, in spite of the neutrality of the Congress Socialist Party, at least 800 votes, if
 not more, out of about 2,300libtech_808_footnotewere (would have been ?) cast against you. And if the Congress Socialist Party had voted as they did in the Subjects Committee, then the resolution would have been defeated. In any case, the result of the voting would have been problematical. With slight changes in the resolution not one vote would have been cast against the resolution and your leadership would have had the unanimous support of all Congressmen. Your prestige before the British Government and before the whole world would have gone up like a shot. Instead, your name and prestige were exploited by those who wanted to wreak vengeance on us. Consequently, instead of enhancing your prestige and influence, they have dragged it down to an unimaginable depth—for the whole world now knows that though you or your followers managed to get a majority at Tripuri, there is in existence a powerful opposition. If matters are allowed to drift, this opposition is bound to gain in strength and in volume. What is the future of a party that is deprived of radical, youthful and progressive elements? The future is similar to that of the Liberal Party of Great Britain.
 I have said enough to acquaint you  with my reaction to Pant's resolution. I shall now be grateful if you kindly let me know what your reaction is. Do you approve   of Pant's resolution, or should you rather have seen it passed unanimously in an
 amended form on the lines that we had suggested?
 There is one other matter to which I shall refer in this letter—that is the question of our programme. I submitted my views to you on February 15, at Wardha. What has happened since then  has   served   to   confirm  my   views,  to   justify  my
 prediction. For months I  have been telling friends that there would be  a  crisis  in
 Europe in spring which would continue till summer. The international situation as well as our own position at home, convinced me, nearly eight months ago, that the time had come for us to force the issue of purna swaraj. Unfortunately for us and for the country, you do not share our optimism. You are obsessed with the idea of corruption within the Congress. Moreover, the bogey of violence alarms  you. Though I am at one with you in your determination to root out corruption within the Congress, I do not think that, taking India as a whole, there is more corruption today than before and, so far as violence is concerned I feel sure there is far less of it today than before. Previously, Bengal, the Punjab and the United Provinces could have been regarded as the hope of organized revolutionary violence. Today there is much more of the spirit of non-violence there. And, speaking for Bengal, I can say with full authority that the province was never more non-violent during the last 30 years than today. For these and other reasons we should lose no time in placing our National Demand before the British Government in the form of an ultimatum. The idea of ultimatum does not appeal to you or to Pandit Jawaharlal. But in all your political
 
 life, you have given any number of ultimatums to the authorities and have advanced the public cause thereby. The other day at Rajkot you did the same thing. What objection can there be, therefore, to submitting our National Demand in the form of an ultimatum? If you do so and prepare for the coming struggle simultaneously, I am sure that we shall be able to win purna swaraj very soon. The British Government will either respond to our demand without a fight—or, if the struggle does take place, in our present circumstances it cannot be a long-drawn one. I am so confident, and so optimistic on this point, that I feel that if we take courage in both hands and go ahead, we shall have swaraj inside of 18 months at the most.
 I feel so strongly on this point that I am prepared to make any sacrifice in this connection. If you take up the struggle, I shall most gladly help you to the best of my ability. If you feel that the Congress would be able to fight better with another
 President, I shall gladly step aside. If you feel that the Congress will be able to fight
 more effectively with a Working Committee of your choice, I shall gladly fall in line with your wishes. All that I want is that you and the Congress should, in this critical hour, stand up and resume the struggle for swaraj. If self-effacement will further the national cause, I assure you most solemnly that I am prepared to efface myself completely. I think I love my country sufficiently to be able to do this.
 Pardon me for saying that the way you have been recently conducting the States' people's struggle does not appeal to me. You risked your precious and valuable life for Rajkot and, while fighting for the Rajkot people, you suspended the struggle in all
 other States. Why should you do so? There are six hundred and odd States in India and,
 among them, Rajkot is a tiny one. It would not be an exaggeration to call the Rajkot struggle a flea-bite. Why should we not fight simultaneously all over the country and have a comprehensive plan for the purpose? This is what millions of your countrymen think, though out of personal reverence for you, they may not say so openly.
 In conclusion, I may say that many people like myself cannot enthuse over the terms of the Rajkot settlement. We, as well as the Nationalist Press, have called it a great victory but how much have we gained? Sir Maurice Gwyer is neither our man nor
 is he an independent agent. He is a Government man. What point is there in making
 him the umpire? We are hoping that his verdict will be in our favour. But supposing he declares against us, what will be our position? Moreover, Sir Maurice Gwyer is a part and parcel of the Federal Scheme we have resolved to reject. In the case of a conflict with the British Government, if we decide to have a High Court Judge or a Sessions Judge as umpire, we can always have a settlement with the British Government. But what shall we gain from such a settlement? Further there are many people who fail to understand why after the interview with the Viceroy, you should be waiting in Delhi. Perhaps, in view of your weak health a rest was necessary before
 undertaking another long journey. But to the British Government and its supporters it may appear as if you are attaching too much importance to the Federal Chief Justice and thereby enhancing his prestige.
 My letter has become too long, so I must stop here. If I have said anything which appears to you to be erroneous, I hope you will pardon me. I know you always like people to speak frankly and openly. That is what has emboldened me in writing this frank and long letter.
 I have been progressing steadily, though slowly. I do hope this will find you better and your blood-pressure much lower.
 With respectful pranams,
 Yours affectionately,
 SUBHAS

  APPENDIX XII  LETTER FROM 	DHARMENDRASINHlibtech_809_footnote      DEAR MAHATMA 	GANDHIJI,        PALACE RAJKOT,  April 	10, 1939 
  I 	am in receipt 	of your 	letter of 	9th instant. 	You are right in 	supposing that 	I should 	wish for the inclusion 	in the 	Committee of 	the four gentlemen 	who were 	appointed by 	me to represent the 	Mahomedan community, 	the Bhayats 	and the 	Depressed Classes. 	I consider it to be of 	the utmost importance 	 that these 	communities should be 	effectively represented 	and these particular 	representatives were 	selected after 	the most 	careful consideration. At 	the same 	time the expedient 	suggested by 	you, viz., 	the enlargement 	of the 	Committee merely to 	give Mr. Patel's 	nominees a majority, 	is hardly 	now practicable. 	What now has to 	be done is 	to take action 	in fulfilment 	of the 	terms of 	my Notification No. 	50 dated 	26th December 1938, 	in the 	light of 	the Award 	of the 	Hon'ble the 	Chief Justice of 	India who 	has observed 	that the 	Notification restricts 	the members 	of the 	Committee to 	ten. As 	stated above it 	is certainly most 	essential that the 	important Mahomedan and 	Bhayat communities 	should, like other communities, have proper representation. It 	was with 	this object in 	view that I 	included in 	the list 	published in 	my Notification No. 	61 dated 	21-1-1939 the names 	of two suitable 	representatives of 	Mahomedan community 	and one of Bhayats. That you shared this view is clearly evident from the assurances    
 which you gave to the deputations of Mahomedans and Bhayats which came to see you on February 28th and the letter you wrote to the President of the Garasias' Association on March 11th. These assurances were, as you will remember, to the effect that the representatives already nominated on their behalf would certainly be included in the Committee. In view of these assurances I have no doubt that you will advise Mr. Patel to include these names in the list of seven non-official members who, in accordance with the Chief Justice of India's decision, are now to be recommended by him.
 I also earnestly hope that the name of Mr. Mohan Madan will be included in his list as this gentleman, besides being a representative of the Depressed Classes, has for seven years been the elected chairman of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation and is obviously a person who should be on the Committee.
 I am sure you will agree that the matter of primary importance is not to secure a majority for any particular party but to ensure that a really representative Committee, effectively representing the various interests in the State, may now be set up consisting of persons fully qualified to undertake the very responsible duties which will devolve on them.
 I am awaiting Mr. Patel's recommendations and when I have received them, I shall appoint the three official members, who will of course have the right to vote, and decide who shall be the President of the Committee.
 Yours sincerely,

  APPENDIX XIII  LETTER FROM 	SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSElibtech_810_footnote      MY 	DEAR MAHATMAJI,       JEALGORA,  April 	6, 1939 
  In 	one of your letters to Majdada, my brother Sarat, you suggested a 	heart-to- heart talk between the leaders of both parties with a view 	to clearing the ground for united action in future. I think it is a 	magnificent idea, and I am fully prepared to do my best in this 	matter, regardless of what has happened in the past. Will you kindly 	let me know if you would like me to do anything in this behalf and 	if so, what? Personally, I feel that your influence and personality 	could achieve much in this endeavour to bring about unity. Will you 	not make one last supreme effort to bring    
 everybody together before we give up all hope of unity? I would beg of you once again to remember in what light the country still regards you. You are not a partisan and people, therefore, still look up to you to bring together all the warring elements.
 I have been pondering deeply over the advice you have given me regarding the formation of the Working Committee. I feel that your advice is a counsel of despair. It destroys all hope of unity. It will not save the Congress from a split—on the contrary, it will make the path safe for such a contingency. To advise a homogeneous Cabinet in the present circumstances will mean advising the parties to part company now. Is that not a terrible responsibility? Do you feel quite sure that joint work is impossible? On our side we do not think so. We are prepared to do our best to ""forgive and forget"" and join hands for the sake of the common cause and we can look up to you to bring about an honourable compromise. I have already written and spoken to you that the composition of the Congress being what it is—and there being no possibility in the immediate future of any remarkable change—the best course would be to have a composite Cabinet in which all the groups would be represented, as far as possible.
 I understand that you are against this idea of a composite Cabinet. Is your opposition due to grounds of principle (viz., joint work is impossible in your view), or is it because you feel that the ""Gandhi-ites"" (I am using this expression in the absence of anything better, and you will please pardon me for doing so) should have a larger representation on the Cabinet? In the latter case, please let me know, so that I may have an opportunity of reconsidering the matter. In the former case, please reconsider the advice you have already tendered in the light of what I am submitting in this letter. At Haripura, when I suggested inviting the socialists to serve on the Cabinet, you told me distinctly that you were in favour of my doing so. Has the situation changed so materially since then as to induce you to insist on a homogeneous Cabinet?
 You have referred in your letters to the two parties being so “diametrically opposed”. You have not amplified the point and it is not clear if the position you refer to is based on programme or on personal relations. Personal relations are in my view a passing phenomenon. We may quarrel and fight, but we can also shake hands and make up our differences. Take, for instance, the Swarajist episode in recent Congress history. As far as I am aware, after a period of opposition the relations between Deshbandhu and Pandit Motilalji with yourself became as sweet as humanly possible. In Great Britain, the major parties can always join hands and work on the same Cabinet when an emergency arises. In Continental countries like France every Cabinet is normally a composite Cabinet. Are we less patriotic than Britishers and Frenchmen? If we are not, then why cannot we have composite Cabinets functioning effectively?
 
 If you think that your opposition is based on programme, etc., rather than on personal considerations, I should like very much to have your view in this matter. Wherein do you think that our programmes differ, and that too so fundamentally, that joint action is not possible? I know that we have certain differences—but, as I wrote  to my ex-colleagues of the Working Committee in reply to their letter of resignation, our points of agreement are, in my view, more numerous than our points of difference.     I still adhere to this view—Tripuri notwithstanding.
 You have said in one of your letters in connection with my idea of an ultimatum on the issue of swaraj that there is no atmosphere for non-violent mass action. But did you not have non-violent mass action in Rajkot? Are you not having  it in some other States also? These States’ peoples are comparatively untrained in the practice of satyagraha. We in British India can claim more experience and training— comparatively speaking at least. If the States’ peoples can be permitted to resort to satyagraha in their struggle for civil liberty and responsible Government, why not we of British India?
 Now take the National Demand resolution passed at the Tripuri Congress with the support of the Gandhi-ites. Though it has beautifully vague phrases and several pious platitudes, it has, in a certain sense, much in common with my idea of an ultimatum and preparing for the coming struggle. Now, do you approve of this resolution? If you do, then why cannot you go a step further and accept my plan?
 I shall now come to Pandit Pant's resolution. The important part of it (last portion, I mean) contains two points: Firstly, the Working Committee  must command your confidence—implicit confidence. Secondly, it must be formed in accordance with your wishes. If you advise a homogeneous Cabinet, and such a Cabinet is formed, one could perhaps say that it has been formed “in accordance with your wishes”. But could it be claimed that it commands your confidence? Will it be open to me to get up at the meeting of the A. I. C. C. and tell the members that you have advised the formation of a homogeneous Cabinet and that the new Cabinet commands your confidence? On the other hand, if you advised the formation of a Cabinet which does not command your confidence, will you be giving effect to the Pant resolution—will you be doing the right thing, from your point of view? I would beg of you to consider this aspect of the question. If you take cognizance of the Pant resolution, you will not only have to communicate your wishes regarding the new Working Committee, but you will, at the same time, have to advise the formation of such a Committee as will command your confidence.
 You have not yet said anything as to the merits of the Pant resolution. Do you approve of it? Or would you rather have had a unanimously passed resolution, more or less on the lines suggested by us which would reiterate faith in your principles and confidence in your guidance, without the controversial clauses? Then, again, what is
 the President's position regarding appointing the Working Committee after this resolution was passed? I am again asking this question because the present constitution is practically your handiwork and your opinion in the matter will carry great weight with me. There is another question, in this connection, which I have been asking you. Do you regard this resolution as one of no-confidence in me? If so, I shall resign at once and that too unconditionally. Some papers have criticized this question of mine in my Press statement on the ground that I should decide for myself what the significance of the resolution is. I have sense enough to give my own interpretation, but there are occasions when personal interpretations would not be one's sole guide. Speaking quite frankly, I feel that my stand has been justified by the result of the Presidential election. I have now no desire whatsoever to stick to office for one day, unless I can thereby advance the public cause, as I understand it. The hesitation or the delay that has arisen on my side is because it is not so easy to decide. Among my supporters there are two schools of thoughts: one holding that I should strive to the last to maintain unity: the other holding that I should break off negotiations at once, as being a hopeless effort, and tender my resignation. The latter have been bringing great pressure to bear on me, but I am resisting. I want to be clear before my own conscience that I have striven till the last to preserve unity within our ranks. Moreover, I know what my resignation will mean in the present circumstances and what its consequences will be. I should add here that the first school—viz., those who want me to exhaust all possibility of a compromise—believe that you will be able to take a thoroughly non-partisan view of things and thereby bring the two parties together.
 I must explain further why I say that I shall resign automatically if you feel that Pant's resolution signifies no-confidence. You know very well that I do not follow you blindly in all that you say or believe, as so many of my countrymen do. Why then should I resign if your opinion is that the resolution signifies no- confidence? The reason is plain and simple. I feel it as galling to my conscience to hold on to office if the greatest personality in India today feels—though he may not say so openly—that the passing of the resolution should automatically have brought in my resignation. This attitude is perhaps dictated more by personal regard for you and your opinion in this matter.
 Perhaps, as some papers suggest, you have an idea that the Old Guard should be put back into office. In that event I would beg of you to come back to active politics, become a four-anna Congress member and assume direct charge of the Working Committee. Pardon me for saying so, and I say this without meaning offence to anybody—there is a world of difference between yourself and your lieutenants, even your chosen lieutenants. There are people who will do anything for you—but not for them. Will you believe me when I say that at the Presidential election even some
 
 Gandhi-ites in several provinces voted for me against the direction of the Old Guard? If your personality is not dragged into the picture, I shall continue to have their support—the Old Guard notwithstanding.
 At Tripuri, the Old Guard cleverly dropped out of the picture and more cleverly pitted me against you. (But there was no quarrel between yourself and myself.) Afterwards they said that Tripuri was a great victory for them and a defeat for me. The fact of the matter is that it was neither a victory for them nor a defeat for me. It was a victory for you (without any cause of a fight with you at all) but a Pyrrhic victory—a victory purchased by a certain loss of prestige.
 But I am digressing. I wanted to appeal to you to come forward and directly and openly conduct the affairs of the Congress. This will simplify matters. Much of the opposition against the Old Guard—and opposition there certainly is—will auto- matically vanish.
 If you cannot do this, then I have an alternative suggestion to make. Please resume the national struggle for independence, as we have been demanding, and begin by delivering the ultimatum to the British Government. In that event, we shall all gladly retire from our official positions, if you so desire. We shall gladly hand over these positions to whomsoever you like or trust. But only on one condition—the fight for independence must be resumed. People like myself feel that today we have an opportunity which is rare in the lifetime of a nation. For that reason we are prepared to make any sacrifice that will help the resumption of the fight.
 If till the last you insist that a composite Cabinet is unworkable and a homogeneous Cabinet is the only alternative before us and if you want me to form a Cabinet of my choice, I would earnestly request you to give me your vote of confidence till the next Congress. If, in the mean time, we fail to justify ourselves by our service and suffering, we shall stand condemned before the Congress and we shall naturally and quite properly be kicked out of office. Your vote of confidence will mean the vote of confidence of the A. I. C. C. in the present circumstances. It you do not give us your vote of confidence—but at the same time ask us to form a homogeneous Cabinet—you will not be giving effect to Pant’s resolution.
 Once again I would beg of you to let me know if your opposition to a composite Cabinet is due to considerations of principle or to the fact that you should like the Old Guard to have a larger representation on the Cabinet than I suggested in my first letter to you, dated the 25th March.
 Before I close this letter, I shall refer to one or two personal things. You have remarked in one letter that you hope that, whatever happens, “our private relations will not suffer”. I cherish this hope with all my heart. May I say in this connection that if there is anything in life on which I pride myself, it is this that I am the son of a gentleman and as such am a gentleman? Deshbandhu Das often used to tell us, “Life is
 larger than Politics.” That lesson I have learnt from him. I shall not remain in the political field one single day if by doing so I shall fall from the standards of gentlemanliness, which are so deeply ingrained in my mind from infancy and which I feel are in my very blood. I have no means of knowing how you view me as a man—in   a way, you have seen so little of me. And my political opponents have carried so many tales against me to you. In recent months I have come to know that for the last few months I have been the victim of a subtle but sinister propaganda carried on against me from mouth to mouth. I would have brought this matter to your notice long ago, but I could not get sufficiently tangible evidence of what was being said and by whom. Latterly, I have come to know much as to what has been said, though I am still in the dark as to who exactly the propagandists are.
 Once again I have digressed. In a letter you expressed the hope that in whatever I did, I would “be guided by God”. Believe me, Mahatmaji, all these days I have been praying for only one thing, viz., for light as to the path which would be best for my country and my country's freedom. I have asked for strength and  inspiration to completely efface myself—should the need and occasion arise. It is my firm conviction that a nation can live only if the individuals composing it be ready to die for its sake whenever it is necessary. This moral (or spiritual) hara-kiri is not an easy thing. But may God grant me the strength to face it whenever the country's interests demand it.
 I hope you will maintain your improvement. I am progressing steadily. With respectful pranams,
 Yours affectionately, SUBHAS

 APPENDIX XIV
 
THE WAY OF SATYAGRAHAlibtech_811_footnote
 At the end of five days' heart-to-heart talks with the Muslim friends, often continuing till midnight, and shorter talks with the Bhayats and having failed with them, Gandhiji put his signature to the letterlibtech_812_footnoteto the Thakore Saheb submitting seven names of the Sardar's representatives. His hand shook as he did so. He never dreamt at that time that within thirty-six hours of the despatch of his letter, his faith in God and ahimsa would be put to test. Ever since his arrival here on his mission of peace, Gandhiji had made it a point to hold daily the congregational evening prayer on the
 
 Rashtriyashala grounds. The practice was kept up during the fast.
 On the evening of the 16th instant a report was brought to Gandhiji that the Bhayats and Mussalmans of Rajkot were going to hold a black-flag demonstration at the evening prayer. There was also a report that a garland of shoes had been got ready for the occasion. He made light of the fears of those who brought the report. He had full faith in the Mussalman and the Bhayat leaders who had friendly discussions with him during the last five days. But in case the worst came to the worst he would welcome it. Accordingly, he gave peremptory instructions that anybody approaching him, no matter with what intent, should be given free access and not obstructed in any way.
 He motored as usual to the Rashtriyashala prayer ground. Almost simultaneously with it the demonstrators, too, numbering about 600, arrived on the scene with black flags and placards bearing inscriptions some of which were highly offensive. They lined the fence enclosing the prayer ground from the main road. The Sardar happened to be away at Amreli that day and so missed the show.
 Gandhiji bowed to the demonstrators, as is his wont, before he sat down to prayer, which was conducted as usual. All the time the prayer was going on, the processionists kept on an unseemly demonstration of shouting and yelling. The creation of disturbance at the prayer time under the very eyes of the Bhayats and Mussalman representatives who had sat with him in conference only the other day was for him the ""unkindest cut of all"". The prayer over, he rose to go. The demonstrators had by now begun to pour in through the entrance of the narrow passage leading to the prayer ground. Gandhiji, instead of going by car as usual, decided to walk through the crowd so as to give the demonstrators full chance to say or do to him whatever they pleased. At the entrance the crush was too great to allow further progress. The pushing and jostling by the demonstrators at the rear on either side of the gangway was growing apace. The dust and the din added to the confusion. Friends tried to form a protective cordon. But Gandhiji waved them off. “I shall sit here or go alone in their midst,” he told them. All of a sudden he was seized by an attack of indescribable pain in the region of the waist, and felt as if he would faint. This is an old symptom in his case that seizes him whenever he receives an acute mental shock. For a time he stood in the midst of that jostling crowd motionless and silent, his eyes shut, supporting himself on his staff, and tried to seek relief through silent prayer, a remedy that has never failed him on such occasions. As soon as he had sufficiently recovered, he reiterated his resolve to go through the demonstrators all alone. He addressed a Bhayat, who stood confronting him and who, he subsequently learned, was besides a police officer in plain clothes, “I wish to go under your sole protection, not co-workers'.” Some Bhayats had already noticed his condition. They now bade the rest to make way for him, and leaning on the shoulder of the Bhayat
 friend in question, Gandhiji walked to the waiting car. “This is the way of satyagraha,” he remarked as the car drove off, “to put your head unresistingly into the lap of your ‘enemy’, for him to keep or make short work of just as he pleases. It is the sovereign way, and throughout my half a century of varied experience it has never once failed me.”
 Two Mussalman representatives from the Civil Station came to see him soon after, according to previous appointment. “You were less than fair to yourself and to us in exposing yourself to such a risk. Anything may happen in a motley crowd,” they remarked to him with reference to the happenings of the evening.
 Gandhiji in reply described to them how such risk-taking had become a part and parcel of his life. There were at least half a dozen occasions in South Africa and in India when he had risked his life like that, and he had never regretted doing so. In all cases the assailant or the would-be assailants had ended by becoming his friends. “But should the worst happen after all,” he concluded, “what privilege can be greater for a satyagrahi than to fall with a prayer in your heart for those whom you wanted to serve but who under a delusion took you for an ‘enemy’?”
   RAJKOT, 	April 18, 1939  Harijan, 	22-4-1939      APPENDIX XV  LETTER FROM 	RANJITSINHlibtech_813_footnote  PYARELAL                April 	17, 1939 
   DEAR 	MAHATMAJI,  I 	have received your letter written on the morning of the 17th 	instant. I have understood from your letter that you have seen the 	handbill issued by the Rajkot Bhayats’ and Garasias’ Samiti and 	you have felt the allegations about breach of promise as serious.  The 	remedy that you have suggested is that all such cases should be 	referred to an arbitrator for his decision. May I suggest to you, in 	this connection, that your letter dated the 11th March be referred 	to Sir Maurice Gwyer for interpretation? If you agree to arbitration 	in this matter, I venture to submit that we can hardly find a person 	better fitted to act as an arbitrator than Sir Maurice Gwyer. If you 	accept my proposal I shall make all arrangements in this behalf, and 	let you know at the earliest    
 opportunity.
 If you had explained beforehand your object in going on foot instead of proceeding by car to the leaders of the procession, they would have certainly listened to you. You need not have the least cause for suspicion in this respect. On the contrary, all our activities are and shall ever be non-violent and peaceful. If anybody has implanted in your mind any suspicion that we contemplate any physical injury to you, I assure you that it is absolutely out of place. I go further and say that if you or anybody else are under any such impression, 50 or 25 volunteers from among our Bhayats and Garasias will remain with you during the whole of your stay in Rajkot.
 The reference made in the Rajkot Bhayats’ handbill to the Congress instead of to the Praja Parishad is only a slip of the pen. Wherever the word “Congress” is, it is used for the Praja Parishad. We have received the printed appeal sent by you.

              DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  APPENDIX XVI  LETTER FROM 	LORD LINLITHGOWlibtech_814_footnote  VICEREGAL 	LODGE, SIMLA,  May 	15, 1939 
  Many 	thanks for your friendly letter of 9th May which I appreciate all 	the more because I realize the pressure under which you have been 	working and the fact that you were writing on the train. Let me 	thank you, too, for leaving me free from business so far as you are 	concerned during my holiday.   I 		have read with interest 		what you say about the 		three problems you 		mention, and 		I think 		it is only 		courteous that I should 		say a 		word or 		two to 		you about 		the position 		as I see 		it at the 		moment, though I 		do so merely to 		put you in 		possession  of 		my point of 		view, and 		not for a moment 		because I want 		to trouble 		you to 		comment on 		what I say, or 		because I think we 		could usefully enter upon prolonged 		correspondence about 		these cases.  I 		have been watching 		events in Talcher 		very closely. 		I am 		satisfied myself 		that the 		Assistant Political 		Agent, when he 		interviewed the 		refugees in 		Angul, made it 		clear that he 		was not in 		a position 		to give 		them any promises 		or come 		to any agreement. That, however, is now past history, and as you will have heard, the Raja     
 recently made an announcement which appeared to me satisfactorily to meet the remaining grievances of any importance of which the refugees complained. I am no less disappointed than you are that this should have failed to produce the desired result, but further enquiries have been set on foot and I hope that the trouble will soon be at an end.
  As 	regards Jaipur, you 	will no 	doubt have heard that 	conversations have 	recently taken place 	between the Jaipur 	authorities and Seth 	Jamnalal Bajaj, and here 	again I hope that a suitable solution of the difficulties will soon be forthcoming.  As 	regards Rajkot, I 	have been very sorry to 	learn of 	the difficulties 	with which 	you have to 	contend. Owing to 	the various 	conflicting interests involved, the 	matter appears to 	have become 	highly complicated, but I 	hope that in 	the absence 	of any 	other solution, 	the Committee 	will be 	set up 	without any 	further considerable 	delay. I understand that 	the question whether certain of the Sardar's nominees are state 	subjects has 	now been decided by 	the Judicial 	Commissioner, and that 	the only 	other preliminary 	point to 	be settled is 	whether the 	assurances which 	you gave 	to the 	Muslims and 	the Bhayats were 	conditional or 	unconditional. I 	understand that 	it has 	been agreed that this 	should be referred 	to an independent 	judicial authority, and 	that it 	now remains 	only to 	decide who 	the judicial authority is 	to be and what should 	be the precise 	terms of reference. 	I will, 	I need 	not assure 	you, continue to 	watch developments in 	Rajkot with 	close attention.  I 	do not in the least 	misunderstand your sympathetic reference, and 	we both of 	us have our 	troubles! But 	it is only 	fair to say 	I have 	no misgivings 	as to the 	loyalty of the Political Department in carrying out my instructions. 
 With all good wishes,
 Yours sincerely,
 LINLITHGOW
