He did no longer like to be the President of this body. This note had created a sensation in the Swarajists’ camp most of whom did not like to lose Mahatmaji’s counsel.

The cow in his opinion was a “totem” for the Hindus, and as such was the repository of unconscious ambivalent feelings. When a cow was killed a large amount of his repressed emotion was let loose and was responsible for the trouble. He suggested that if a suitable symbolic animal could be devised, and if Hindus and Muslims could meet on a common platform, and participate in the sacrifice of this symbol, the tension could be relieved. The members of the Society sought Gandhiji’s views on this thesis."
