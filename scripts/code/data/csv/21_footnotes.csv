They have built their  houses  there. Thousands of them have been born in Fiji. . . Surely, you will not ask these all to return to India. . . What shall we do for these fifty thousand Indians. . . I would suggest three things for favour of consideration : 1. We must make it clear to the public here that the Government of India is going to add insult to injury by sending a commission to Fiji to enquire into the labour condition in Fiji after their refusal to press for an independent enquiry into the Fiji Tragedy. No Indian worth the name should go to Fiji in that commission of the Government of India.  2.  We should send  a commission of our own to enquire into the causes and consequences of the recent disturbances in Fiji."
