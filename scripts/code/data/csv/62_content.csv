 BHAI KOTWAL,
    LETTER TO KOTWAL   
 November 20, 1933
  	The work which has come to us unsought is swadharma. Anybody 	who is wedded to an institution should not, as a general rule, join 	the present battle. One’s dharma cannot be pointed out to one by 	somebody else. He who has seen it adheres to it despite the 	opposition of the whole world.  	We should not sit in judgment over anybody. Every case should 	ultimately be judged on its own merits. It is therefore dangerous to 	be guided by solutions of hypothetical cases.

          BHAI 	VAMANRAO,     LETTER TO VAMANRAO     November 	20, 1933 
  	I have been able to take up your letter only today. What little I 	have read about Shivaji was as a student at school. It is shameful 	but true. Afterwards I learnt about him more from the elders. But 	when I realized that British historians, particularly those 	belonging to the official community, could not see things from our 	point of view even if they wanted to, I adopted a yardstick: Without 	reading up any other material I concluded that just the opposite of 	whatever I had read must be true and I started believing that 	Shivaji was really a great king, brave and patriotic. These 	qualities were more than enough to arouse my feeling of reverence 	for him.  	To expect more from me at this time is to be like a cruel milkman 	who extracts the last drop of milk from the cow till she starts 	bleeding.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original: S.

    SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, MORSI   
 November 21, 1933
 These differenceslibtech_393_footnoteare verily offshoots   of the curse of untou- chability, for they proceed from a sense of superiority and inferiority. The fourfold division of varna is based on duty and not on right. Dharma does not confer rights but lays down obligations. Where all perform the duties that have fallen to their lot, no one is higher than the others. Once we are able to purge ourselves of untouchability, and with it the spirit of high and low, we shall realize the unity underlying all races and religions. In spite of the differences of races and reli- gions, we shall learn to tolerate and respect one another and consider all human beings as children of one God and, therefore, brothers and sisters of one another. God is the Creator of all life; all his creatures are, therefore, equal in His eyes. Humanity is a gigantic tree having innumerable branches and leaves, and the same life throbs through them all. The realization of unity in diversity is implied in the removal of untouchability.

 In his message Mahatmaji says that the people of Berar gave an unlimited response to his call for Harijan service. The organization was most efficient and looked to all the comforts in the tour which has been a pleasant one.
The attendance at public meetings held throughout the tour was
 the largest ever seen and it gives me cause to hope that untouchability is fast dying.

    LETTER TO MAHADEV DESAI   
 Unrevised	RAIPUR,
 November 23, 1933
 
MY DEAR MAHADEV,
 On getting up at 3 a.m. I found your letter to Mira lying on the little stool which is being carried from place to place as a footboard for me to stretch my legs on. It took me nearly 40 minutes to go through it and yet without reading your comments on the translation of the verses specified.libtech_404_footnotelibtech_405_footnoteIt would take me at least twelve hours to read up my translation [of] the original and think out what I should say. It will take at least another three hours to reduce them to writing. That time I cannot give just now. Then there is the question—shall I help you much ? I fear, not. For what you say is quite true. I ought not to have yielded to Swami’s demand for my own translation except perhaps for private circulation among friends. I realized my unfitness for the task as I was proceeding but I continued. The defects you have noticed are there. How can I give what I have not—scholarship ? Want of good knowledge of Sanskrit was a great drawback. The remedy is clear. You should go on with your translation taking such help as my translations can give to bring out my thought but not always following my translation. Give that rendering which is acceptable to you. Ignore the notes where they are useless. Give your own where they are nece- ssary. Having done that, take up the Gujarati, correct the translation where it is defective and polish the language where it needs polishing. Re-write and add notes where necessary. That will complete your task. Then when the whole result comes into my hands, I shall work on it and make such changes as I may deem fit in order to bring out my meaning. This I can do easily. We must then bring out a revised version of the Gujarati and publish your translation in English.libtech_406_footnotelibtech_407_footnotelibtech_408_footnoteSo doing, you do not need to stop your work for want of my detailed reply to your comments. I shall circulate your comments among friends and get their opinion and let you have it all.
Your other messages will be attended to.
 
 I am glad you are going through the trials of various sorts. Only do not wash yourself out with mere literary work. You should take plenty of exercise and keep the body in a fit condition. You must not damage your eyes on any account whatsoever.
 No more today.
 Love from all.

     CHI. 	PRABHAVATI,  November 	23, 1933 
  	I got your letter. You have given two addresses.  In your previous 	letter you gave the Siwan address and in this one you have given the 	Sitabadiara address. I am writing this letter at the latter address.  	I have already written to you about Jayaprakash. I addressed that 	letter at Siwan. The present fight is not for people who have debts 	to pay and wish to discharge their responsibilities towards their  	brothers and sisters. This fight requires one to sacrifice one’s 	all. How do a poor man’s brothers and sisters get education ? We 	should adopt such a way that our brothers and sisters grow up in 	poverty and get educated and start earning as soon as possible. That 	leaves  the  problem of Father. The fifty rupees which he gets 	should suffice. Both of you should renounce your share in his 	property. Jayaprakash can remain in the present fight only if he is 	thus prepared to embrace poverty. This is a soldier’s dharma. The 	other dharma is towards  one’s family. It also is worth following 	if one wishes to do so . When it becomes an absolute dharma, it is 	in conflict with the good of society as a whole. That is what we 	find among us today. It is the aim of satyagraha to remedy this 	situation. But anybody who does not understand satyagraha and still 	follows it fails in both dharmas for he will remain discontented. If 	you do not understand anything in this, you may ask me to explain 	again. But I don’t think you will find any difficulty in 	understanding it.  	I have already sent you the programme of my tour, and do not repeat 	it here. There is nothing now which you should specially come 
 here to discuss with me. But I shall be in Jabalpur on Tuesday. Then I go to Delhi.
 My weight is 109 and the blood–pressure 155–100. The diet remains the same.

    BHAI 	VALLABHBHAI,  November 	23, 1933 
  	You really seem to have stopped writing to me. It was necessary for 	Jamnalalji to resign even for his own peace of mind. The resig- 	nation was desirable from the point of view of its effect on others, 	too. It has cleansed the atmosphere completely. A load is off 	Jamnalalji’s mind and he feels much stronger now. I don’t wish 	to write more. Please however have no doubts about the propriety of 	the step.  	I hear that there has been a small breakdown in your health. Let me 	know if there has been any such thing. If you can tell me your 	weight, do so. Is there any trouble with your nose ? I hope you 	wouldn’t think it necessary to keep back anything from me.  	Mahadev is being tested well. I am glad about it. There are diffi- 	culties now regarding Gujarati letters. I intend to write to the 	Colonellibtech_409_footnotein 	the matter, though I don’t like to do even that.  	I have had no letters from Devdas recently. Khurshed is im- proving.

    SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETTING, RAIPUR libtech_410_footnote   
 November 23, 1933
 I have repeatedly said that this work can be done only by those who sincerely believe untouchability to be a stain on Hinduism. This is a movement requiring the change of heart of millions. It cannot be led to success by any political manoeuvres. It can be done  only through self–purification. This is a great sacrificial fire in which we have to burn our load of sins and come out purified. Those who do not take to this work with faith and spirit will fail to move the hearts of millions. We shall be nowhere if we deceive ourselves or the Harijans. The success or failure of this movement depends on our getting the right type of workers. We are on our trial today. If we miss today the oppportunity that God has given us, we may never hope to get the opportunity again in this generation. What we refuse to do voluntarily today we shall have to do in future per force, and we shall repent for having lost this opportunity. I pray to God that we may come out suc- cessful from this trial and save Hinduism and ourselves from des- truction.

    SPEECH AT ALL–INDIA SWADESHI EXHIBITION, RAIPUR   
 November 23, 1933
 In a country where 95 per cent of the population live on the land, even if all the processes of cultivation were carried on through machines, there would still be need for a supplementary cottage industry. The spinning-wheel supplied that supplementary industry to the Indian peasant from time immemorial. Many minor industries are nowadays suggested for the purpose, but none of them can be universalized as the production of khadi can be. I consented to open this exhibition, for I know that thousands of Harijans get their living through khadi, which has saved them from destitution. We may revive
 
 
 many other indigenous industries, may even start new ones, but we may not lose sight of khadi as the centre of all swadeshi.

    EXTRACTS FROM SPEECHES libtech_411_footnote   
 [Before November 24, 1933]libtech_412_footnote
 Injustice is being done all the world over, but we have given to it the sanction of religion. These distinctions have not been created by God. The Harijans are on the lowest rung of the ladder not because of any inherent defects but only because they have been kept down by the so–called higher castes. God had bestowed on them the same talents that He had given us, but we deny them the opportunities for using them. They should surely have the same rights and privileges and the same opportunities of growth that we enjoy.
 We are now awake to the wrong we have done to them, and the least we can do by way of penance now is to contribute money for their uplift and to share with them all the amenities of life that we have created for ourselves. We are all creatures of the same God and, therefore, equal in His eyes.
 From the money that you give for this cause, you will reap a hundredfold, for it is like grain sown in good, manured soil. The money spent after luxury and lust is, on the other hand, wasted like grain sown in barren soil.libtech_413_footnote
 I am told you have suffered heavily. But you should know that no nation has ever come to its own without having passed through the severest fire of suffering. Voluntary suffering only adds to our strength. I, therefore, congratulate you for having suffered. But I should also like to remind you that one of the causes that add to our sufferings is this curse of untouchability. We have oppressed the weak. We reap as we have sown. It is for us now to undo the wrong we have done to the Harijans and remove the yoke of serfdom from their
 
 shoulders.libtech_414_footnote
 Caste Hindus must first ask you to forgive the wrongs they have done to you. But I should also tell you, as a Harijan by choice, that you should give up your evil habits, especially carrion and beef– eating. The whole world looks upon carrion with abhorrence. And beef–eating should be given up because that is a sine qua non for a Hindu. The cow is the giver of plenty, and by killing her we kill ourselves. Then, I would urge you not to accept leavings. And, above all, you should abolish the distinctions of high and low that have crept in among yourselves. And these things you should do, not in a bargaining spirit but because they are good in themselves. I would, therefore, ask you also to give up drink, irrespective of the fact that many other Hindus drink.

    CIVIL RESISTANCE AND HARIJAN SERVICE   
A friend writes :libtech_415_footnote
 I observe that there are some people in the Harijan service organizations not working in the spirit in which you want them to, that is, merely for the sake of serving Harijans. They are seeking its shelter in order to satisfy other ambitions. . .I know that you do not desire civil resistance to be mixed up with Harijan service organizations. If you propose to make any public use of this letter you may emphasize this last point and make it clearer.
 . .
 I am thankful to the friend for giving me the benefit of his experience. It is a most difficult task to keep a big organization like the Servants of Untouchables Society with branches all over India free of all self–seekers and time–servers. I have discussed the subject fully with Seth Ghanshyamdas and Thakkar Bapa. I know that they are both anxious to keep the organization as pure as possible. Personally I can do no more. It was because of my utter helplessness that I undertook the fast of 21 days. On discovering impurities amongst Harijan servants, I saw that it was no use merely writing about impurities. I was searching for a way out of the difficulty. The reader should believe me when I tell him that the fast was the last thing in the world that I was thinking of, but as I have described in these pages, it came to me all of a sudden and gave me great relief. I know that it did much good. But, how far could the fast of a single mortal go ? Hence
 
 it was that I developed the idea of a chain of such purificatory fasts. The idea has by no means been dropped. It comes to me again and again. But it does not admit of a mechanical organization. Several co– workers are ready to inaugurate or take part in the chain after it is inaugurated, but I have not yet found the way to begin it. The proper way will have to come to me or to the co–workers before the chain can be begun. Meanwhile I can only reiterate my conviction that untouchability will not be removed root and branch except through the service of men and women who take it up for its own sake and in a religious spirit. Unless we have a fair number of such servants throughout the length and breadth of India, we will never succeed in changing the hearts of millions of human beings. The savarna Hindus are at one end, Harijans at the other, and the evil custom of ages, which has assumed the dignity of religious tenet, will not be uprooted without penance and purification. Whilst it gladdens my heart that thousands of people flock to the meetings that are being held in towns and villages and that they willingly give their pices as a token of their approval of the movement, I am painfully conscious of the fact that, if the thousands were suddenly called upon to enforce in their own lives what they seem to approve by their attendance at these meetings, they would fail to respond, not from want of will, but from sheer inability. I have discovered this again and again amongst my closest associates who have frankly confessed their inability to enforce immediately in their conduct what they knew was the right thing and what they knew had to be done immediately. They had to put up a brave fight against their traditional repugnance. The mere intellectual grasp that untou- chability is an evil, corroding Hinduism, and that belief in it is tanta- mount to disbelief in God, His goodness and His Fatherhood, is not enough to destroy the monster. The vicarious penance of the com- paratively pure is needed to bring about a change in the hearts of both savarnas and Harijans.
 A movement, so grand and so pure, so religious and so humanitarian, must not be exploited by anybody for his own end. Certainly, not for its political consequences. It will be discovered, as the movement progresses, that the political approach can only end in accentuating the strife. It can only add to the confusion already existing and add one more, if not many more warring parties, to the existing ones. May God save us and save the movement from such a calamity !
So far as the connection of civil resistance with the movement is
 concerned, I am as emphatic as ever that Congressmen who desire to offer active civil resistance should not accept office in the various organizations, and much less can they be used for serving the purpose of civil resistance. Civil resistance is a unique weapon, it does not admit of alloy. It is a weapon of the fearless and, therefore, needs no shelter; but it has to be wielded in the open daylight. Therefore, whilst Congressmen who are also civil resisters on active service may do, as they are bound to do, such service to the cause as they can, they may not belong to the Servants of Untouchables Society or any of its branches. By holding office in the organizations they will harm both civil resistance and the Harijan cause. It would be like a man going to  a temple to pray and using the act of worship for advancing civil resistance. Neither God nor man will be cheated in that manner and, as I have said often enough in these columns, the great reformation of Hinduism will not be brought about, if it is to depend purely upon Congressmen. For, much as I would like to think that every Indian is Congressman, I know that such is not the case. Nor is every Hindu a Congressman, if only because every Harijan is not a Congressman. Therefore, a Harijan organization must in the very nature of things be strictly non–political and non–party and should contain in it both Congressmen and non–Congressmen, office–holding being restricted to those who are not active civil resisters and who will not exploit the office secretly or openly to advance the cause of civil resistance.
 Harijan, 24–11–1933
 
    HARIJAN WORKER’S DUTY   
 A correspondent sends me the  following  questions  for answering :
  In 	the propaganda 	against untouchability, should a 	worker make use 	of the 	Hindu Shastras 	and religious 	texts to 	show that Hinduism 	does not sanction 	untouchability as 	we practise it 	today ?  Should 	a Harijan 	sevak, even in 	his private 	capacity, take part in 	inter– dining 	functions ?  Should 	a Harijan 	who is 	employed as 	a domestic 	servant sit 	at meals 	alongside all 	the members of 	the family ? 
 These three questions, the correspondent says, have been seriously discussed in the columns of a newspaper and the readers have been advised that Harijan workers ought not to make use of religious texts in advocating the abolition of untouchability, and that,
 in the larger interest of the movement, the workers should not enforce their views about inter–dining and the rest, even in their private matters. I hold totally different views on these matters. For me, the removal of untouchability is fundamentally a religious question. Hinduism could not hold me if I believed that untouchability, as it is practised today, was an integral part of it. That it has been handed down to us as a custom is an undoubted fact, but so are many other bad customs among which untouchability is the worst. It becomes necessary, therefore, to show that it has no sanction in religion.
 Whilst the Servants of Untouchables Society has very wisely limited the scope of its corporate activities, it does not regulate or restrict individual practice about inter–dining. The removal of untou- chability does not require inter–dining with Harijans. Inter–dining is not a universal obligation. A Harijan worker must be left free to dine with whomsoever he pleases, and, therefore, with Harijans, without in any way being regarded as being on that account a less effective worker. My own practice is well known, and I should personally feel a hypocrite if I suppressed it ‘in the larger interests of the reform’. I should undoubtedly refrain, if inter–dining were a mere matter of convenience or indulgence for me. Far from being either, I regard it as a desirable and an inevitable social reform. But it should not be mixed up with the drive against untouchability. The central point in the untouchability movement is the removal of social and religious injustice towards those who, being regarded as untouchables, are debarred from public utilities and spiritual comfort within the religion to which they belong. I should feel no deprivation if no one in the world took food that might be cooked or touched by me. But it would be a great deprivation to me if I could not send my children to the public school, or could not rent a house in any locality open to the other members of the public, or could not seek spiritual comfort in a temple designed for the other members of my faith.
 As to the Harijan employee, if the members of a family employing a Harijan drew a line between him and non–Harijan ser- vants, they would undoubtedly be guilty of observing untouc-hability. But I very much fear that we are a long way from that bright and happy day when we shall be all masters and no servants, or all servants and no masters, all members of the human family, regarding ourselves as blood–brothers and blood–sisters.

If these crowds are not an indication that 	untouchability is fast going, I do not know what can prove it. It 	must take time for the mighty reform to be felt.  Later,  	The foregoing was written amid interruptions. Your letter written 	during the voyage or in Bombay has just been received. About 	Gurudev’s visit to Bombay I have written very little. I do not 	even know what is going on. I can hardly read papers during this 	rush. But    
 of course he would be quite all right in so far as the reception is concerned. Of money he is not likely to get much. My appeal about Orissa is bringing very little.
 Of course, Elwin should go his way and be left in God’s hands. But friends must issue warnings when they have doubts as to the propriety of actions on merits. It is difficult to say when it is God’s voice and when it is not. Strangers have to judge every act on its merits. This is applicable of course to my claim in connection with my fasts. I wrote a long letter to E. on what appeared to me his hasty departure from Matheran and avoidance of Wardha. I have not heard from him at all after his going back to Karanjia.
 I hope I shall not have to cable you to return. The Magistrates have not worried me up to now. And when and if they do you would be too late for guidance. You should therefore trust me to God even as Efy is doing, even as you are trusting E. to God. I know that He is guiding me.
Love.

 MY DEAR AGATHA,
 No long letter this  week.  Here  is  a  letterlibtech_417_footnotelibtech_418_footnotefor  C.  F.  A.  The cuttings will give you some indication of the progress of the tour. These of course you will share with friends as you may think necessary.
 I do not think of the political atmosphere. It is as bad as ever. It does not worry me much and it will not worry me at all if there was chivalry and gentlemanliness on the part of the officials. The insatiable desire for humiliating everybody and every organization is terrible. But enough of this grumbling.

 CHI. VASUMATI,
  LETTER TO VASUMATI PANDIT 
 November 24, 1933
 
  	I wrote several letters to you. I hope you got them. I got one 	letter from you. You seem to have done quite good reading. It seems 	you have given up the study of English. Tara has got one tooth 	extracted and is suffering extreme pain. She had to be kept under 	chloroform for one hour. She is a little better now. I have started 	a long tour. Except for two days [in the week], I have to travel 	every day. I am accompanied by Mirabehn, Om and Chandrashankar, and 	of course Thakkar Bapa. There are others too, but you do not know 	them. So far I have kept good health. Ba and Manibehn have gone to 	Ahmedabad. Totaramji will take Hariprasad with him and go and live 	in the Harijan Ashram. The Satyagraha Ashram has now become Harijan 	Ashram. My weight stands at 108. My normal diet is milk, oranges and 	one green vegetable. I 	have dictated this letter to Om during my meal.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : S.N. 9338. Also C.W. 584. Courtesy : 	Vasumati Pandit     SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, RAIPUR   November 	24, 1933  	Ever since I came to your province you have been showering love on 	me and I am still bathing in it. Here also you have further 	delighted me by presenting me this purse. You would be right if you 	believe that you should give me money to please me, and especially 	so if you fulfil one condition. It is that those who have given 	money should feel that they have contributed to a yajna of 	self–purification. The money that is given can only be a token of 	your contribution to that yajna. But if they think that they 	have done all that they need to by giving the money, it would be the 	worst characteristic of a clever Bania. It would be as if by giving 	that money they had bought the right to enjoy themselves as they 	wished. Such charity can be of no 
 benefit to the Harijans. I do not deny that money is very badly needed for Harijan work; but it is more important for their service that you should accept the Harijans with your heart. The real purpose of this tour is that you should discard the notion of untouchability from your heart and banish feelings of high and low. If you give me no help in realizing that aim and give me only money, it would be difficult even to use that money. If you do not know it, please note that at least 75 per cent of the money collected from this place will be used for the Harijan work here. There are two conditions, however, and they are also meant for the success of this work. In the first place, a good scheme for the use of that amount should come from you, and along with that there should be an indication of the persons who would carry out the scheme. A scheme may be good on paper, but it will be useless and will fail if there was nobody to implement it. That is why I said that, if your heart is not behind your contribution, the money you have given will be as good as useless. And if this happens, it would be diverted to other places where better workers and better schemes are forthcoming. You would not be happy if this happens. We who have come here do not wish to do any such thing. Our intention is to use at least 75 per cent of the money in the place from where it is collected. If, however, you do not give your full co–operation in this work, nothing can be done with the money alone.
 It is a matter of joy for the country and for Hindus that at every place people gather in such large numbers. I am working in the faith that all these people come to the meetings to help me in my work of removing untouchability. If they come because they think that I have served the country in the past, and in order to praise my past services, they are guilty of great deception. I think of no other work just now. I have undertaken this tour only for Harijan work, and not to hear my praises. Hence, only those who wish to help me in this  work  or criticize it should attend the meetings. Those who wish to oppose the work should express their opposition courteously and in a becoming manner. In a religious cause, forgetting courtesy means forsaking dharma itself. Rudeness and lack of courtesy go ill with religion. Religion must be accompanied with gentleness, courtesy, culture and compassion. I do not wish to waste my time.
 It would no doubt pain me to know that the Hindu masses are not with me. But it would pain me all the more if they attend the meetings to deceive me and themselves. I have got to follow my dharma even if everybody deserts me. The scriptures say that you
 need not have anyone on your side for following dharma, that you need God alone. Following dharma is a matter for each individual himself. One must do one’s duty to the best of one’s ability. God will look after the rest. The dharma of fighting untouchability is precious like a gem. I have placed it before you. This is no ordinary gem which can be used only by one person or which would wear off by use. Millions can use the gem of dharma ; the more the people use it, the brighter will it shine.
 There is no doubt at all that unless we wipe out the blot of untouchability from Hinduism, both Hinduism and Hindu society will perish. Peoples and their religions are being compared and judged all over the world. We are living in an age when we can travel to distant places in a few days by train and go round the world by sea. And now aeroplanes too are coming into use. In an age like this, all religions are exposed to the eyes of the world. If we fail in this scrutiny we may be sure that we are doomed. The world has a right to make such a comparison. That which cannot be placed before the world and which is not acceptable to reason and the heart cannot be sanatana dharma. Sanatana dharma means imperishable Truth.
 I was glad when I was told that Bharatdasji intends to throw open his temple to Harijans. The site of the temple is very beautiful. I performed the opening with God as witness. The Harijans had cheerfully come in large numbers. The scriptures have laid down two or three conditions for the Harijans or other people who visit a temple. They must enter the temple with a pure heart and body. Observing rules of personal cleanliness is as necessary in the case of Harijans as in that of the other Hindus, and, therefore, they should be duly observed by them. The second condition is that they should give up eating beef and carrion. The latter is prohibited in every religion. I am not aware of civilized and religious–minded people eating carrion, anywhere in the world. It is abhorred by all mankind. Harijans must give up these two things irrespective of whether or not they are accepted by the caste Hindus. If they consider themselves Hindus, they must give up beef also. Now there is a fourth thing, which I cannot describe as an inseparable part of Hinduism, though it is so according to me. And that is abstention from intoxicating drinks. Other Hindus may or may not give them up, but you should definitely do so. It is a very bad habit. A bad habit should not be copied. Moreover, you want to progress, and so you must give up drinking. Other Hindus will follow your example. Giving up intoxicating drinks
 
 will save the country crores of rupees and change a man from a monster into a human being. You must not consume the thing that makes you forget how you should behave to a mother or a sister. Those who are used to collecting and eating leavings must give up that unclean habit for good. Eating the leavings is not for human beings. It is the fault of the caste Hindus that you have got into this habit. In their ignorance caste Hindu women give leavings to Harijans. Instead of that, they should keep apart a certain portion every day  for Harijans from what they may have cooked for themselves. My mother always used to feed us and take her meal only after keeping apart the portions for the guest, the poor and the cow. It is a cultured tradition in a good household that such portions be kept apart. Similarly, you also should take out something for the Bhangi Harijans and give it to them with love. It is not civil to throw food in the fold of the dress or in a vessel from a distance. It is an act of contempt. There is no politeness in it but lack of it. Caste Hindu women should give up throwing leavings to Harijans and the latter should stop accepting them. Harijan men and women who visit temples should observe the rules that may be applicable to all the varnas equally.
 The Satnami Harijans at Dhamtari told me  the  painful  story that the barbers and the washermen there do not work for them  because they are considered untouchables. Those who told me this were as clean as ourselves. When I visited their dwellings, I found that they were not more unclean than the houses of other Hindus. In the course of my tours in the country, I have got an impression that the houses of Bhangis are cleaner than those of other Hindus. It is tyrannical that washermen and barbers should not serve such peple. It is painful and a matter of shame for us that when such a great movement of self–purification is going on barbers and washermen should refuse to serve these people. I do not blame the washermen and barbers for this. It is the doing of the so–called high–caste Hindus who have misled them. They have put the idea into their minds that they would be incurring sin if they worked for the Harijans. Since they have got such an idea, they hesitate to serve the Harijans. This should not be. Other people who know better should explain this to the barbers and washermen. Educated young men from among the caste Hindus should learn hair–cutting and washing clothes. And they should go to Harijans and tell them that they are ready to cut their hair and wash their clothes. If the educated people do this, the simple– hearted barbers and washermen would do it too. When they find that
 even the people who are not bothered about money are doing such work, they also would do it. There is no question of religious degradation in this. No sanatanist has told me that barbers, washermen, doctors, etc., cannot serve Harijans. I do not know how the idea that it is dharma to refuse such service originated. Such barbarism should go forthwith.

  SPEECH  AT  BALODA 	 BAZAARlibtech_420_footnote 
 November 25, 1933
 Gandhiji declared open to Harijans a private temple, saying that the temple had on that day become a true abode of God with the Harijans’ entry into it. Asking Harijans to observe three conditions of temple–entry, which apply equally to all temple–going Hindus, he said :
 I request you to contribute your full share to this movement of self–purification, not by money but by a thorough cleansing of the heart and body and by removing the evil habits that have crept in amongst you. Though I admit with shame that the caste Hindus are responsible for many of these evil habits, I should like you to do your own part by giving up carrion and beef–eating and observing the common rules of cleanliness. These three conditions apply equally to all Hindus who want the right of worship in Hindu temples. I should like you to give up drink also, irrespective of the fact that even some caste Hindus indulge in that intoxication. You may not imitate their vices. Drink is one of the most degrading of vices, reducing man to the state of brute. It vitiates both body and soul. It spells utter ruin of the moral and domestic life. I would, therefore, request Harijans in all earnestness to give up that vice and set a noble example of self- purification not only to caste Hindus but perhaps to the whole world.

  SPEECH  AT  BILASPURlibtech_421_footnote 
 November 25, 1933
 You may know, if you do not know already, that I have been closely assoicated with labourers ever since I went to South Africa. Whenever I have gone among labourers, in South Africa, India or whatever part of the world, they have recognized me as a fellow– labourer and received me as one of themselves. You will perhaps be surprised  to  know   that   even   labourers   in   Lancashire instinctively
 
 recognized me as one of themselves and flocked around me in hundreds and thousands. The only difference between us is that I have become a labourer by choice whilst you have been made labourers by force of circumstances and would perhaps love to be masters if you could. I early gave up the ambition of becoming the master for I would then have belonged to an inconsiderate class and could not have identified myself, as I do today to the best of my ability, with the penniless pauper, the half–starved and the naked, the lowliest and the lost. I want labourers not to deplore, much less to despise, their lot and to realize the dignity of labour. It is meet that you have come forward with your purse as a token of your sympathy with the Harijans. Who has suffered so much as they ? They are at the lowest rung of the ladder. The terrible hardships and privations they have to undergo can never be imagined by those who have not been victims to them. Other labourers may aspire to a mass wealth and to become masters some day and thus to rise in the scale of social prestige; but the Harijans can never entertain that ambition. The stigma of untouchability attaches to them from the mother’s womb. They are born outcastes and remain outcastes till death. They have to live in segregated areas and are denied the amenities of life that the others enjoy. Even water, that free gift of God, is denied to them. I ask the Labour Federation to abolish all distinctions between Harijans and yourselves. I make the appeal deliberately for, being in direct touch with the mill–hands in Ahmedabad, I know that labourers do observe the distinction between Harijans and non–Harijans. I expect labourers, more than all others, to efface these distinctions. It has been my deep faith that we shall some day achieve communal unity through labourers. I consider labour to be a powerful unifying agent. It is a great equalizer. It should be a matter of shame to have communal divisions among labourers, who all earn their bread by the sweat of their brow and, therefore, belong to one vast brotherhood. Let them, therefore, begin with a thorough removal of untouchability. It will be a great step towards communal unity. Once the bar sinister against Harijans is removed, the way will be open for a wider unity among Hindus, Mussalmans and other sister communities.
 A Mussalman friend asked why Gandhiji, a national leader, had chosen for the time being to work only among a section of the nation. This question drew the following reply from Gandhiji.
I  am trying to serve all communities today through this  work.
 They are branches of  one big family. I   have  found  in   the  Hindu
 branch a disease which, if not removed in time, will spread through the whole family and destroy it. The evil of untouchability has travelled far beyond its prescribed limits. In trying to root out untouchability among Hindus, I am trying to serve all the communities. Though the method of achieving communal unity through conferences has failed, I have not despaired of a heart–unity being achieved in the end. God has sent me this work, and I am doing it in the faith that the way to a real communal unity will be paved through it. It is thus to my mind a service of the whole nation. The effort I made in 1920–21 to achieve Hindu–Muslim unity will go down in history and will serve as the foundation of the edifice of communal unity whenever it is achieved.  I have never repented for having made that effort. For me it was not a matter of expedience. I am not aware of having done a single thing in my life as a matter of expedience. I have ever held that the highest morality is also the highest expedience. Some European friends assure me that I am waging this war against untouchability on behalf of the whole of humanity. Once this canker is removed from Hinduism, Hindus, Mussalmans and others will sink their differences and will embrace one another as blood–brothers, and all communities will feel that they are all branches of the same tree.

   LETTER TO MARGARETE SPIEGEL      RAIPUR, 
     MY 	DEAR AMALA,  November 	26, 1933 
  	What have you done to your finger ? Dwarakanathji says you have hurt 	yourself. I hope you are not overstraining yourself. I want you to 	do everything with joy and infinite patience.  	It appears that on the 15th December we shall  be  passing through 	Wardha as was originally arranged. The programme was altered so as 	to omit Wardha and go via Calcutta. But now the original 	programme has been restored. While I admire your self–restraint in 	not coming to the station last time, I would like you to come on the 	15th, if you get Dwarakanathji’s permission.  	I see that you are spinning much better than you used to, and you 	have prepared your strand nicely and neatly. I am sure that by 	proper application you would be able to spin finer, stronger and 	much 
 more even. I hope that there is not much waste nowadays and that you know how to mend your wheel if it goes out of order. I hope you are just as happy as our Japanese friend. You will be surprised to know, when years ago in South Africa I first cut my own hair, it looked as if rats had been at it. My lawyer friends cracked jokes at my expense. But I survived their jokes and I was able to do much better next time. The same thing happened with my first trial at ironing shirts and collars. I do not mention this incident to induce you to repeat your experiment. You should get your hair cut by the barber who gets a fixed salary no matter how many heads he treats.

 him to send a bottle with somebody to whichever place it may be convenient to do so.
 Jawaharlal writes and informs me that the Working Committee will be meeting in Jabalpur on the 5th. He seems to be expecting that you will attend. Do you feel inclined to come ? If you don’t wish to, I will not mind. Come if you feel like it. This will mean that you will have to leave that place on the 3rd or the 4th instead of on the 7th. I certainly don’t like that you should sacrifice so many days from your stay there.
 Mathuradas is coming here tomorrow. I don’t know what brings him here.
 I observe that Om has a sharp intelligence. And she has simple habits, too. She has fine health. She seems to be enjoying everything.  I also give her some writing work. She sleeps near me. Her capacity to sleep is quite good ! She has won everybody’s love.
 Has Janakimaiya recovered some peace of mind ? Is Kamla progressing satisfactorily ? Can she walk ? How do  Madalasalibtech_422_footnoteand Vatsalalibtech_423_footnotespend their time ? I send with this an improtant letter received from Manilal. Keep it in a file. It contains some comments about the Cow–protection Society and a list of the jewellery.

I wish that I could have a heart-to-heart chat 	with you. I shall try to write to you at length in spite of the 	pressure under which I am working. But I know that the letter will 	never yield the result that a brief conversation can.  	From your letter, I had gathered that you were not fit to seek 	imprisonment, and knowing your domestic difficulties as I now do, I 	feel that until those difficulties are satisfactorily solved you 	ought not to think of imprisonment.  	By labour I mean any kind of physical labour that you may be able to 	perform. Such labour for you is tailoring, shoemaking and any other 	healthy labour that you can think of. Whilst you will not 	immediately earn much, it will mean a mighty revolution in your 	life. Your children will then be brought up as labourers.libtech_431_footnotelibtech_432_footnoteAs 	such they will not have to struggle so much to live, as you do just 	now. And when your attitude is changed, you will set for yourself 	and the whole family the labourer’s standard of life. Your wife, 	if she accepts the revolutionary change, will also be doing her 	share of labour.     
 You will be interested to know that my sisterlibtech_433_footnotelibtech_434_footnote, because she will not live in the Ashram, owing to non-observance of untouchability,  earns  about Rs. 15 per month by grinding. Giri, who with her three  daughters and two sons was in the Ashram for seven years and whom I declined to support on the breaking up to the Ashram, but whom I advised to take to some labour is now earning from the labour of her two daughters nearly Rs. 30 per month by preparing sweetmeats and fritters for a hotel-keeper. And her son isearning about the same as a carpenter. Dal Bahadur Giri was not a labourer. He was living an almost aristocratic life. I believe that the widow and her daughters are happy. They have not cut off all connections with me. Two daughters are grown-up girls, marriageable, but have no present intention of marrying. They can read and write but they have learned the dignity of labour, and therefore are not a burden on society. Now I hope you understand what I mean by physical labour.
 Now for the education of your children. If you accept the revolution that I have suggested, naturally the children will be brought up by you. You will give them not merely a literary training but you will give them also a training for labour with their hands. Immediately you begin this life you will find it to be a pleasure and all your difficulties will automatically be solved, and you will be rendering a distinct service to society by setting a wise example. I do want you to get out of the mood of despondency and helplessness. Do write again if this does not explain all I mean.
 Yours sincerely,
 BAPU

  LETTER TO BRIJKRISHNA CHANDIWALA 
 November 26, 1933
 CHI. BRIJKRISHNA,
 Your letter. I sent a wire to Dr. Ansari immediately on getting it. He must have seen you. What a pity that no one can be found in your house or outside to recite the Gita. Tulsidasji has offered us a Gita in the form of Ramanama to cope with such a situation. We do not have to commit Ramanama to our memory—it is done no sooner than it is uttered—what we are required to do is to commit it to our hearts. Regard Ramanama as the true medicine for you. If God spares your life, you should teach the small children of your family to recite from the Gita.
 What more shall I say ? You are with us every moment. You have to course acquitted yourself well in the role of a worthy son. But how shall I become a worthy father?

  SPEECH AT RAJKUMAR COLLEGE, RAIPUR libtech_435_footnote 
 November 27, 1933 When I received your invitation I felt at once that, if the Reception Committee here could make the necessary time, I  would
 love to address this audience of students who, when they have finished
 
 their education, will be called upon to bear a great responsibility and burden. And it was a matter of great pleasure to me that the Reception Committee was able to set apart one hour for this function. I thank you, Sir, for having extended this invitation to me, thereby enabling me to deliver my message to the youths who are at present under your kind care. You were thoughtful enough to send a message to my host, Shuklajilibtech_436_footnotelibtech_437_footnotethat, whilst I could  address this audience in Hindustani if I so chose, you would appreciate it if I addressed them in English; and you were good enough, when I exchanged a letter with you, to tell me that many of the boys under your care did not know Hindustani. I at once decided to address you, in spite of my ordinary practice to the contrary, in English. Your Principal inadvertently supplied me also with a text for my message. I would like you, sons of Chiefs in these territories, to remember that you would be expected not merely to confine yourselves, in these days of progressive enlightenment and rapid inter–communication, to your comparatively very small territories, but you would be expected to extend your horizon; and if you will do so, as I have no doubt you will be obliged to do by force of circumstances, it will be necessary for you not merely to know the languages of the province in which your lot is cast, but you will be expected to know also the language that is most universally used in this country. And you may not know, all of you, I am sure, do not know, that over 22 crores of the people of this country know sufficient Hindi or Hindustani to be able to understand what is spoken to them and to express themselves, however broken their language may be. No Indian having to shoulder the responsibility that you will have to shoulder can possibly afford to ignore such a universal language. There is a method in my mad love of Hindi. I am a lover of the English language, and I would like to speak in the  English language as well as is possible for a foreigner to do and compete with Englishmen. I know that I am far away from that consummation. Whatever English I know is due to my having lived for years among Englishmen and English–speaking men. I count hundreds of English- men and women as close friends. So you will not misunderstand me when I tell you that it is your duty to understand Hindustani and I will beg the Principal and his staff to realize the special condition of this
 
 country and to feel with me that it is desirable for the Chiefs of India to understand Hindustani, through which alone they can know the India of the people.
 This brings me to the central point of my message. We have been in the midst of Englishmen in various walks of life. I have had the painful duty very often of criticizing the policy of the rulers. I have not minced words. I have spoken straight from my heart, but as I have told you, I claim the closest friendship with hundreds of English- men. I cannot forget some of their priceless virtues. I propose to single out one of them for you. In England there is a living family tie between its noblemen and their domestic servants. It was a matter of joy to me on visiting them in their homes to find that there was a subtle bond of affection between them and their servants. There was no untouchability there. What I have told you is literally true of hundreds of the noblemen of England. Wherever I went, it was an unexpected pleasure to me at the end of the visit ot be introduced to the domestic staff not as inferior beings but as members of the family.  I wish that you would copy this virtue in your own lives. There is unfortunately among us a feeling that Chiefs are Chiefs and they can never make common cause with the ordinary people and so you find the tragedy—however necessary it may be today—that special schools and colleges have got to be built for you. You dare not, you will not,go to common schools and colleges.You may not know that King Edward and the present King, I am speaking subject to correction, worked in the Navy as if they were ordinary sailors and that both father and son shared the hardships of a sailor’s life. Will you do that
 ? You are confined as it were to hot houses and are taught to believe that you have been gifted with special divinity by God. Believe me there is absolutely no difference whatsoever between you and the common folk except this that you have opportunities that are denied to them. But if you do not make use of the opportunities God has given you, it will be counted against you in God’s book of accounts. Know that the essence of education lies in drawing out the very best that is in you. You and I can take the positive comfort that is in you. You and I can take the positive comfort that all of us have an equal potential capacity for being good or bad. I, therefore, feel that all your education will be vain, if you do not learn the art of feeling one with the poorest in the land.
 This brings me in the natural course to untouchability. In no other part of the world has a patent evil like untouchability been claimed to possess religious sanction as it has in Hindu India. But, if you have agreed with me so far, you are bound to regard the Harijan
 as an integral part of common humanity. You have to realize your oneness even with him. It may be that your parents will dispute the proposition that untouchability is an unmixed evil. You will then have to show the courage of your conviction even as young Prahlad did. The idea of hereditary superiority and inferiority is, in my opinion, repugnant to the spirit of Hinduism which teaches oneness of all life in unequivocal terms. The religions of mankind are being examined and tested both analytically and synthetically. And I have no doubt that, if Hindus cling to untouchability, Hinduism and Hindus will be swept out of existence. I cling to Hinduism because it gives me all the solace I need and because I have found in it no warrant for untouchability as we know it today.
 If I have invited you  to  copy  the  virtues  of Englishmen,  I must with deference to English friends present  here  warn  you against their vices. That immortal poet–saint Tulsidas has left us  a  verselibtech_438_footnotelibtech_439_footnotefull  of  deep  truth.  He  says  that  we  should   live  even as the fabled swan does, sift virtue from vice and take the former, leaving  the  latter  alone. I  would  have  you,  therefore,  to  leave alone their two national vices, drink and races. Many Englishmen de- plore them. I have seen many an English home being ruined by the craving for liquor and gambling at the races. And so have many prin- ces been ruined by them. I hope that you will learn to shun these two evils.

  LETTER TO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU 
 November 27, 1933
 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
 Here is Gasavi’s letter. I am telling him, I see no objection to the Party so long as it is not claimed as the Congress Party and that in any case he should seek your advice.
 I note that we are to meet at Jubbulpore on 5th December. I shall try to give more time, if it is at all possible.
 Have I not sent you the programme for C.P.? More than that was not ready till now.
So you are being gradually disburdened of shares and the like. I
 
 am not sorry. From my point of view the ideal thing would be a voluntary surrender of all the property you have, either to an institution or to those members of the family who do not want to throw themselves into the battle which is bound to be prolonged and perhaps increasingly bitter. In the final heat only those will be able to stand who have no property and nowhere to rest their heads on. But it is no use worrying over the future. Whatever happens you will be found in the front rank.
 I am glad that Mother is making steady progress. I wonder if she knows all that is happening.
 Yes, I did read your attack on the Hindu Sabha. It might have been less fierce. The summary made you speak like a partisan.
 Love.

  LETTER TO C. RAJAGOPALACHARI 
 November 27, 1933
 Did I tell you Jamnalalji’s Omlibtech_440_footnotewas one of the party? She is a gem—healthy, open, brave, willing and exceedingly intelligent. She is only 15 but looks twenty. All the member of the party are happy but she seems to be the happiest. Of Thakkar Bapa it is difficult to speak in exaggerated language. He is the spirit of service personified. Most methodical in his work, never allowing arrears, most considerate, yet the most exacting. He knows no rest. He reads up correspondence in the car. He has no time for chatter. He could not have made a better secretary I have prized him always as a rare man but I have come ever so much closer to him than before.
 But I must stop now, hoping that you are keeping well. Love.

   LETTER TO GORDHANDAS PATEL      WARDHA, 
   DEAR 	GORDHANBHAI,  November 	29, 1933 
  	It was your duty to write the letter you did; it certainly was your 	right. Your pain is deep. A letter from me cannot erase it, but time 	will. It must have been a surprise to you that I did not attend 	Krishna’s wedding. Garlands I send to many girls. On the death of 	persons who are Hindus I never send wreaths. I did not send wreaths 	for Motilalji, or Das or Lalaji or Lokamanya and I have never sent 	wreaths on any occasion of death in India. Nobody felt the need for 	my presence either. Before I expressed my opinion as to how Valla- 	bhabhi should proceed, he had himself decided along the same lines. 	I had a letter from him to this effect. But I do not expect to 	convince you by arguments. Only believe me that the episode you 	refer to has absolutely no bearing on the way I acted. I have tried 	to follow to the best of my ability what I considered to be my duty 	towards Vithal- bhai.  	I did not come to Wardha for two days for rest. I got two days for 	silence every week which I naturally spent at Wardha, because the 	tour that week was to cover the Wardha district and the adjoining 	areas. But that is not a defence. If I had considered it my duty to 	go to 
 Bombay, I would have somehow managed it. But I did not consider it my duty and that incident had nothing to do with it.

  LET EVERY CASTE HINDU REMEMBER libtech_441_footnote 
 That the following resolution was unanimously passed on his behalf by the meeting of his representatives held in Bombay on 15th September, 1931, Pandit Malaviyaji being in the Chair :
 This Conference resolves that henceforth, amongst Hindus, no one shall be regarded as an untouchable by reason of his birth, and that those who have been so regarded hitherto will have the same right as other Hindus in regard to the use of public wells, public schools, roads and all other public institutions. This right shall have statutory recognition at the first opportunity and shall be one of the earliest Acts of the Swaraj Parliament, if it shall not have received such recognition before that time.
 It is further agreed that it shall be the duty of all Hindu leaders to secure, by every legitimate and peaceful means, an early removal of all social disabilities now imposed by custom upon the  so–called untouchable classes, including the bar in respect of admission to temples.

  NOTES 
 THE LATE LALA GANGARAM OF SIALKOT
 It was only through the kind offices of a friend that I came to learn of the recent death of Lala Gangaram. He died on the 4th [November] of heart failure, at the age of 60. I had the privilege of meeting him in Lahore at the late Rambhajdutt Chowdhury’s house in 1919 when he was introduced to me as a thorough–going Harijan worker. His was a life of dedication to the Harijan cause. He was instrumental in founding Harijan colonies. His death is a distinct loss to the cause. I offer my condolences to the family of the deceased and to the Harijans who were under his special care.
 
 AVOID WASTE
 Reception Committees have been encouraging the habit of presenting flower garlands and bouquets by everyone who will do so. Such presentations are a waste of time and money in  a  tour  undertaken on behalf of the lowliest. If garlands must be presented, let them consist of undamaged strands of yarn which can be used for weaving. There are Harijan weavers who are idle for want of hand– spun yarn. These will not weave mill–spun yarn. The best thing is to avoid all garlanding. And where reception without garlanding is considered impossible, let the garlands be accompained by money. The practice of accompanying garlands with money became a feature after Wun and it has already added a few hundred rupees to the amount of donations received. Let the public note what one  pice means in this country and in the hands of the hungry and despised. It makes the dole that charity gives per head to the famishing in flood– stricken Orissa. Let the doubters see the hovels in which the Harijans are living. Let them visit the low–lying Harijan lane of Hinganghat, where in the rainy season it is hardly possible to exist. They will then understand the value of the pice that goes into the pocket of a Harijan. I would like the public to save their pice and give them to me for the sake of Harijans. It will be part payment of the heavy debt caste Hindus owe to Harijans.
 Harijan, 1–12–1933
 
  SCHOOL BOOKS 
 There seems to me to be no doubt that in the public schools the books used, especially for children, are for the most part useless when they are not harmful. That many of them are cleverly written cannot be denied. They might even be the best for the people and the environment for which they are written. But they are not written for Indian boys and girls, nor for the Indian environment. When they are so written, they are generally undigested imitations hardly answering the wants of the scholars. In this country, wants vary according to the provinces and the classes of children. For instance, wants of Harijan children are, in the beginning stages at least, different from those of the others.
 I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that books are required more for the teachers than for the taught. And every teacher, if he is
 
 to do full justice to his pupils, will have to prepare the daily lesson from the material available to him. This, too, he will have to suit to the special requirements of his class.
 Real education has to draw out the best from the boys and girls to be educated. This can never be done by packing ill-assorted and unwanted information into the heads of the pupils. It becomes a dead weight crushing all originality in them and turning them into mere automata. If we were not ourselves victims of the system, we would long ago have realized the mischief wrought by the modern method of giving mass education, especially in a case like India’s.
 Attempts have undoubtedly been made by many institutions to produce their own text–books with more or less success. But in my opinion they do not answer the vital needs of the country.
 I lay no claim to originality for the views I have endeavoured to set forth here. They are repeated here for the benefit of the managers and teachers of Harijan schools, who have a tremendous task before them. They dare not be satisfied with mere mechanical work resulting in simply making the children under their charge indifferently and in a parrot–like manner learn the books chosen anyhow. They have undertaken a great trust wich they must discharge courageously, intelligently and honestly.
 The task is difficult enough but not so difficult as one would imagine, provided the teacher or the manager puts his whole heart into the work. If he becomes a parent to his pupils, he will instinctively know what they need and set about giving it to them. If he has it not to give, he will proceed to qualify himself. And seeing that we have started with the idea that the boys and girls have to have instruction in accordance with their wants, no extraordinary cleverness or possession of external knowledge is required in a teacher of Harijan and, for that matter, any other children.
 And when it is remembered that the primary aim  of  all education is, or should be, the moulding of the character of pupils, a teacher who has a character to keep need not lose heart.

  A ‘DOUBLE HELL’ 
 A Harijan servant in Orissa gives me a graphic description of his visit to some Harijan quarters in Balasore District, near Bhadrak :libtech_442_footnote
 
 Is it any wonder that we have malaria, plague, and cholera rampant in our midst ? It is impossible to avoid these diseases so long as we neglect these useful members of society, consign them to the dirtiest places and, because of the monster of untouchability, we would not teach them to do their work in a proper and efficient manner. I suggest to workers all over the country that they must concentrate their effort upon the plague spots which they visit. Let us not be baffled by the vastness of the problem. Things will right themselves if everyone will attend to the work that comes his way.  I  would, therefore, advise the workers of Bhadrak to go to the merchants, make out a simple plan of improvement, present them with a budget, level up the ground, put up plinths and rebuild the fifteen houses. It cannot be a heavy budget and I doubt not that by sufficient importunity they will be able to raise a fund to reduce that plan to execution. The donors will find that the donations are a sound investment in a health– promoting project. It would be like putting their courtyards in order.

   LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL      ITARSI,

  	I am writing this letter at 3.15 a.m. in a dharmashala at Itarsi. 	Mirabehn has gone to wash her face. After that we will pray, and 	then leave immediately to catch the train to Kareli, from where we 	have to go to Anantpur. Jethalallibtech_443_footnoteis working there. Yesterday we were at Betul, and 	from there we came here by train, held a meeting and slept in this 	dharmashala.  	I got your letter. How much can we do to counter what is being done 	by The Times of India ? Still I 	go on doing what I can think of.  I get very few opportunities to 	read newspapers these days. I feel that the Harijan work is being 	indeed watched by Hari. The power that draws hundreds of thousands 	of people at every place [that we visit] will also expose the lies. 	If we remain careful enough and make no mistakes, we shall have done 	our duty.    Spot” 	(vide p. 	18), had written : “I have no doubt that if you could see this 	quarter. .  .you 	would call it a ‘double hell’.”  
 I know very well that your spirit is following me in my tour. How do you know it is not protecting me ? Didn’t I see every moment in Yeravda that you feel a mother’s love for me ? The same love is visible in every line of your letters. And it is all–embracing. That is why you are carefully watching every day from there.
 Please don’t worry about me, nor about what is happening in the country. This is God’s work. “Who can repair what has gone amiss, O Lord ?”
 We are in the train now. I take it that you will do whatever may be necessary regarding your nose.

  	I have your letter. I call it good because it is truthful. I knew 	you were deceiving yourself and me. Will you now tell me what your 	nature demands? If it demands simply being in my presence, it cannot 	be satisfied. If it demands more teaching work and a life natural to 	most Europeans, I shall try to help you with hope of success. You 	should confer with Jamnalalji when he returns. Meanwhile do so with 	Dwarakanathji. You ought to be steady and brave. To desire to die is 	cowardice. There is nobody about you who has any wish to repress 	you. You have built in front of you a mountain of difficulties. Make 	your choice resolutely and act. It 	is nearing 3.30 a.m. now. I get up always as usual, at 3 a.m. 
 Just after washing I read your letter and began this. You must be wise and sure.

     LETTER TO SURENDRA MASHRUWALA   December 	2, 1933  CHI. 	SURENDRA, I have your letter.  	Yes, for the present you may build up your health. You may go after 	Jamnalalji returns from the hill-station. There is no doubt that 	just now there is no other duty for us except that of serving the 	Harijans and going to jail. Even in respect of these two I see that 	very few would now remain who would choose the second course. 	Hardships in jails are likely to increase now. Life in jails 	requires the utmost degree of physical and psychological 	tapascharya. Only a handful of us, therefore, would be ready 	for jail-going now. Those who do not understand the religious 	meaning of suffering in jail have no place in jail at all.  	There is no escape from undertaking fasts unto death. Whether it 	comes today or tomorrow is another question. The 	above portion was written at three sittings. This is the fourth. It 	is  	3.30 in the morning. I am with Jethalal in his Ashram at Anantpur. 	The solitude of the hour is perfect. Mirabehn and Om are sleeping on 	one side. There is no sound except of their breathing. Now to resume 	the question of the fasts. They, too, will come by and by. They will 	commence when we are fit for them. Today foolish people are freely 	using this most effective weapon, but everywhere I hear stories 	about their fasts. Fortunately, few people can remain hungry for a 	long time. Hence the number of those who merely copy the example of 	others is insignificant. But their cases demonstrate that when used  	without  one’s being qualified for it the weapon has no value at 	all. It is such a wonder weapon that it can never do harm. When  an  	unqualified person resorts to it, it will harm his health a little 	that is all. Such people cannot even prolong their fast to the point 	of death.  My purpose in writing all this you is that we have 	nothing to think or do except  cultivating  fitness.   We  should  	not  even   wish  that   the  fasts 
 should commence. We should be ready, that is all. While I am alive, no one else need on his own resort to a fast for the service of the Harij- ansor in connection with satyagraha for any other object. Tell Durbarilibtech_444_footnotethat he can write whenever he wants. He need have no hesi- tation at all. If he throws himself into service heart and soul, many of the difficulties will solve themselves.
 How do you use your time these days? What is your diet? You must drink milk and eat ghee as you need to build up your helth. Do not count the cost. They will be easily available. Therefore accept them. If we do not get them, we should not feel disappointed. But when they are available, we should regard it our duty to accept them. When you have cultivated indifference to taste, it is unnecessary to feel hesitant in such matter. If you do not get either of the two things in jail, are you not going to do without them? “He whose understanding is secure, who is undeluded, who knows Brahman and who rests in Brahman, will neither be glad to get what is pleasant, nor sad to get what  is  unpleasant.”libtech_445_footnoteThe   body   has   been   rightly   compared   to Chintamani. If we look upon it as an instrument [of service] given by God, we are duty-bound to take proper care of the God-given instru- ment. Even in jail you should not hesitate to inform the authorities about your physical condition. After thus taking the necessary steps for the protection of the body, we may sing, ‘Let this body perish or survive.’
 It is now four o’clock and the others have got up. Prepara- tions have started for the prayer and so I must stop.

  SPEECH AT SAGAR 
 December 2, 1933
 It is a good omen to me and to my cause and service of Harijans that such a big rush of people has come for me. I believe that they really want to drive out this curse of untouchability from the Hindu society. All are equal in the eyes of God and they have equal right to use public wells, schools and temples. The present movement is directed towards self–purification and one should not think oneself high or low in one’s estimation.
 The form in which untouchability is practised in India is to be found in no other country and it does not find support in the code of Manu. I am not an atheist. I have fifty years of experience and have not observed such distinction.
 Replying to a long letter received from sanatanists, he said he had not practised adharma. If he did so he would be guilty in the eyes of God and man alike.
Even if I am left alone, I will preach this very thing.
 Continuing, he advised the audience not to insult or injure the sanatanists but to love them as a mother loves her child. He firmly believed that a day would soon come when the sanatanists also would be with him.
 Turning to the Harijans, he advised them to cultivate habits of cleanliness and give up carrion–eating and to abstain from drink. He dwelt on the efficacy of prayer and advised the Harijans to pray every morning in Hindi, because no knowledge of Sanskrit was necessary for prayer. He recalled his own 50 years’ experience and showed how God had relieved him in moments of difficulties. While going to the temples they should go after a bath and in clean dress.

  SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, JABALPUR 
 December 3, 1933
 If this effort to abolish root and branch the distinctions of high and low succeeds, it will have a healthy reaction on all spheres of life, and the struggle between capital and labour will cease and give place to co–operation and concord between the two.libtech_446_footnotelibtech_447_footnoteIf we have  understood the full implications of this war against untouchability, we should have no difficulty in realizing that untouchability based on birth is only one of the countless phases of that curse. We should thus be better serving the cause of freedom and communal unity that I  have  at heart. My faith in the movement has grown from day to day. I implicitly believe that, if we succeed in abolishing untouchability from Hinduism, all the quarrels between classes and communities that we see today in India will cease. The differences between Hindus and Mussalmans and between capital and labour will be composed. Once the hearts are purified, it will be found easy to overcome all difficulties in the way of a heart unity. The phase we are at present dealing with does not exhaust all the possibilities of the struggle. The untouchability as practised today in Hinduism is the worst of all the phases. Masquerading under the name of religion, it has contributed most to the degradation of man by man. I have said that untou- chability is a many–headed monster and appears in many shapes and forms, some of them so subtle as not to be easily detected. There are many degrees in untouchability. I was conscious of all these im- plications when I took up this war and made up my mind to devote my full energy, in the evening of my life, to this work.
 All true scouts have my blessings.libtech_448_footnoteIn   my   many  wanderings over many parts of the world, I have come in contact with thousands of boy scouts. True scouts are brave, considerate, courteous, and intelligent. They should have a full sense of their duty. They have been working to preserve order at the numerous fairs in the country where millions gather. I would also like them to give a part of their time to the service of the Harijans. Anyone who sees Harijan quarters with my eye will be convinced that there is ample scope for service for all who have the will and the capacity to do it. It does not require extraordinary intelligence. The only thing required is a sense of identification with the Harijans.
 
 There is no end of difficulties in the way, but there is not a single difficulty for which there is no remedy. The beauty of a religious movement lies in the fact that all difficulties blocking its progress are automatically solved. God himself clears the way. His is the guiding hand, we are but His instruments. If we gird up our loins to fight this age-old sin against God and man and observe fully the conditions laid down by Shastras and followed by sages of old and humbly seek Divine aid in our undertaking, we are sure to win the grace of God. These conditions require a thorough observance of truth and non-violence and the utmost sacrifices and sufferings. If we have all that and, above all, charity and goodwill for our opponents, the difficulties, howsoever great, will surely melt away.

  	We arrived at Jabalpur last evening. It is 6.30 just now. I got your 	letter yesterday in Katni. I saw the work being done at Anantpur. It 	is all solid, but for that very reason it is also slow. Jethalal is 	an extremely efficient worker.  	Gordhanbhai is very much displeased with my conduct. I am of course 	trying to explain things to him. His idea is to spend the money in 	foreign countries. I have advised him against doing that. He has not 
 consulted me yet regarding the will. If he does, I will naturally remember what you have said in your letter. The whole thing seems strange, but I wouldn’t be surprised if what we hear were really true. Whatever it is, the truth will come out in time. The big guns are expected today. I see that all will meet tomorrow.libtech_449_footnoteWe shall be put up at different places. Aunt is coming. Ansari also may come.
 Brijkrishna is on his death-bed. You know that during the fast he had looked after me with the utmost devotion. I keep myself informed about his condition. There is a wire from Dr. Ansari saying that there is a possibility that he may survive the crisis.
 I learnt only from your letter that Mahadev had been given a companionlibtech_450_footnotelibtech_451_footnote.  Joshi   is  keeping   very   well.  I   heard   about   Ba  only yesterday after we had arrived here. I am glad.

  SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, MANDLAlibtech_454_footnote 
 December 6, 1933
 I have said that those who come to these gatherings as an appreciation of my political services and not because they believe in removal of untouchability deceive themselves and me. I invite only sympathizers and opponents to these meetings, the latter if they wish to signify their opposition. I want you to be true to yourselves and reject me if you do not see eye to eye with me in this matter.
 There are two sets of pundits who give opposite interpretations of Shastras. The layman then has to make use of his Godgiven reason and choose between the two.libtech_455_footnotelibtech_456_footnoteUntouchability, I have found, appeals neither to the intellect nor to the heart. The essential urge of the heart is towards compassion and sympathy for the sinner. Temples  are meant for sinners, where they can wash away their sins. What is the use of temples to a liberated sinless soul, who sees God everywhere ? If you believe that Harijans are in their present plight today as a result of their past sins, you must concede that they have the first right of worship in temples. God has been described by all the scriptures of the world as a Protector and Saviour of the sinner.
 There is untouchability in the Shastras in a particular sense. Anger, lust and other evil passions raging in the heart are the real untouchables. It is a prostitution of Shastras to interpret them as sanctioning the distinctions we observe today. A true man of piety will consider himself a sinner and, therefore, untouchable. We in our haughtiness have hitherto misinterpreted the Shastras and have raised a sin to the status of a religious tenet. I claim to be a true sanatanist, because I make the greatest effort I can to live up to the truth as I see it. Diversity there certainly is in the world, but it means neither inequality nor untouchability. An elephant and an ant are dissimilar. Nevertheless God has said that they are equal in His eyes. The inner
 
 oneness pervades all life. The forms are many, but the informing spirit, is one. How can there be room for distinctions of high and low where there is this all-embracing fundamental unity underlying the outward diversity? For that is a fact meeting you at every step in daily life. The final goal of all religions is to realize this essential oneness.

 SUPERINTENDENT, YERAVDA GAOL
 BA,
 You must have got the letter sent with Ranchhodbhai. Take care of your health. Do not worry about anything. You shouldn’t go on thinking about things. Trust my life to God. Can there be any better protector than He? There has been no change in my food. Wherever I go,  pendaslibtech_457_footnotelibtech_458_footnoteare  kept  ready  for  me.  Generally  I  accept  them,  but sometimes I refuse. My personal needs are looked after by Mirabehn and Om. Mirabehn has only one thought day and night. She doesn’t attend any meeting, but spends all her time in keeping things ready for me. She keeps well. I had got cold but I am better now. I am in Jabalpur today. Gopi’s parents live here. I met them and her younger sister. Govinddas’s house also is in this town. Brijkrishna is still seriously ill. Ask somebody to write to him. Prabhavati writes to me. Take proper care about your food. If you need anything,  get  it through Ranchhodbhai or Chimanlal. How is your mouth and the foot? Who are your companions? Write to me at the Wardha address. I hope all the women are in good health. Tell Amtussalaam that I have written a letter to her. Ask Mani to write to me. I hope she keeps good health.

 I have discussed with Harakhchand and Jivanlal the proposal for Purushottam’s betrothal.

   LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL      JABALPUR, 
    BHAISHRI 	VALLABHBHAI,  December 	7, 1933 
  	I had a very long letter from Gordhanbhai which of course I didn’t 	preserve. He had pointed out in it all my shortcomings and 	contrasted them with Vithalbhai’s virtues. I had returned a very 	loving reply to that letter. I have received no acknowledgment. As 	for the 
 moneylibtech_459_footnotewhich is lying with me, he had sent me an oral message. I told Mathuradas in reply that I would not let it be used in  foreign  countries. You must have seen that he has now made a public appeal to me. We shall know the whole truth by and by. I hope to be able to manage the situation well enough. You needn’t worry.
 I will write regularly to Ba. This time she was not very willing to go to jail. But God will see that everything is all right. Thakkar Bapa had shown me your letter. It was not his fault at all. He tries hard indeed to save me from all inconvenience. He doesn’t let any troublesome people come near me. He saves me from a great many things, but sometimes he is helpless. I am sure we shall learn from experience and things will keep improving. Don’t worry about this either. “God’s will be done.”
 Kishorelal is ill. He is a little better now. He is in Bombay. Write to him.
 Jivraj’slibtech_460_footnotehealth seems to have been affected very much. He is in Hotel Rugby in Matheran.
 Mathuradas was in the crowd.libtech_461_footnoteHe is still with me. He will remain with me up to Delhi. His health also seems to have been affected. He suffers from backache. He cannot move freely. If he takes rest I think he will regain strength. It may be said that, at the meeting, they talked  a little and then left. Maulana Saheb and the Doctor tried to persuade me not to be uncompromising. On my explaining my conflict of duties, they became silent. The matter was discussed in minute detail. I felt that Nariman had no sense. I told them:“If somebody writes ‘Whither India ?’ and another writes ‘Whither Congress ?’, I hope it wouldn’t seem too much if I write ‘Whither Nariman ?’.” Jawahar is indeed a jawaharlibtech_462_footnotelibtech_463_footnote. About Jamnalalji I needn’t write anything. He has put on weight. His health is all right, more or less. Chikhalda benefited him very much. The condition of his ear is as bad as that of your nose. One is without nose, and the other is deaf. To whom may I complain about these difficulties ? Please let me know, however, if the injections help you now. I like your idea of trying  netilibtech_464_footnotelibtech_465_footnoteBut who will

I see no harm in both of you entering the templelibtech_470_footnotefrom there. We have no money and should not have any. 	For that reason it seems right to me that you should go [to jail] 	from there. Jamnalalji would         
 not leave you in peace.
 Madhavji wishes to go to Karadi. I approve. He is not at Wardha. He has to choose his field of work, and therefore can choose only Karadi. Moreover, it seems but proper that one of you three should go [to jail] from there. Since Madhavji has money, let him go from Karadi.

  LETTER TO DURBARI 
    DEAR 	DURBARI,  December 	7, 1933 
  	I got your letter. Personally I like the idea of wearing the sacred 	thread and vest. From your point of view it certainly cannot have 	any religious significance. But respecting harmless customs is  also 	 religion. You should meet members of your family if you can do so 	without letting it interfere in any way with your mission of 	service. Serving any of them individually is now outside your field 	of duty. However, it is not proper for me to confuse your thinking. 	Your dharma lies in what Surendra advises. He alone will save you. 	However, you will have to give up the desire of living even with 	him. It is not at all likely that you will be together in jail. Of 	course it would be good if that happened of its own. I 	am glad that your health has improved.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a copy of the Gujarati: C. W. 10736. Courtesy: Gomatibehn Mashruwala

  SPEECH AT LEONARD THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE 
 JABALPUR,
 December 7, 1933
 I, who believe in the equality of the great religions of the world and from my early days have learnt to honour other re- ligions as my own, have no difficulty in inviting and taking the co-operation to the followers of other religions in this movement. It is part of my nature. This is essentially a matter of repentance on the part of the so-called higher classes. They have to do re- paration for the wrongs they have hitherto done to a portion of themselves on whose backs they have hitherto ridden. It is an effort on the part of Hindu reformers to blot out this shame from the face of Hinduism. I have not hesitated to say that either untouchability lives and Hinduism perishes, or untou- chability goes and Hinduism rises purified. It is a life-and-death struggle bet- ween the darkness of superstition and the light of reform. If this reform in Hinduism comes about, I have  not the shadow of a doubt that it will be a service not only of all the communities of India but of the whole of humanity. I am not thinking of achieving this reform by any form of compulsion, including legal. It is said that, in trying to seek support for the two Bills now before the Assembly, I am really supporting a policy of legal compulsion. I do not want to repeat here the whole argument against that contention; but I want to assure you that there is no compulsion in the Bills; and those who care to study them will endorse my opinion. This must be a reform from within. It is not a political movement. I do not want to deny that it will have great political results, but I have never for a moment thought of achieving through this movement the political rise of the so-called upper class Hindus. It is to my mind a movement of downright purification.
 Having made these introductory remarks, it is easy for me to tell you on what terms you can give your assistance to the movement. You should work in co-operation with and, if I may say it, in subordination to the Society that has been formed for suppression and eradication of untouchability, namely, the Servants of Untouchables Society. That is to say, you should put your talents at the disposal of the Society. I do not mean metallic talents. These have to come from those who have to make repentance and reparation. I have seen during the few days of my tour that millions are ready for the reform. They can tangibly signify their support only by giving their coppers. But men and  women of intelligence are wanted to work for the Harijans in a variety of ways. For the so-called caste Hindus to serve the Harijans in a constructive manner is to get off their backs, to go down on their knees to them, to treat Harijan children as their own and Harijan men and women as blood-brothers and sisters. It is almost a superhuman task and cannot be done without Divine aid. But Divine aid comes largely through human agency. I confess that we have too few teachers and other professional men and women in our ranks. We want to cope with the ever increasing demand. I invite the aid of agencies like yours in this work. You will now understand what I mean by subordination. This is the right way.
 But there is also the wrong way. You may choose to work independently. You may have the conversion of Harijans to Christianity. You may see in the movement a chance for propaganda. If you work among the Harijans with such an aim, you can see that the very end we have in view will be frustrated. If you believe that Hinduism is a gift, not of God but of Satan, quite clearly you cannot accept my terms. You and I would be dishonest if we did not make clear to one another what we stand for.

 Islam enjoins upon us tolerance towards others’ religions. It doesn’t say that other religions are false. He alone who does good to others is a true man. This is the principle of the Koran as also the teaching of other religions. The students of the Jamia, I hope, will spread the message of unity and freedom throughout the country.
 I do not propose to attend the Hindu-Muslim unity conference.  I want unity of hearts among the followers of the two faiths so that Mother India may attain freedom.

293. SPEECH AT LABOURERS’ MEETINGlibtech_476_footnote
 DELHI,
 December 10, 1933 [Gandhiji] congratulated the organizers of his programme on the happy beginning made with   a  visit   to   Harijan   quarters  and  followed   by   the labourers
 meeting.
 Thanking them for the purse, the Mahatma said he knew that half the amount in the purse was contributed by the employer (Mr. G. D. Birla) and half by the labourers from the Labour Welfare Fund. To present such a big sum was the work of rich persons and not of labourers, and besides this, most of them were Harijans and it did not behove him to take money from them to remove the curse of untouchability. It was the duty of high-caste Hindus like Mr. Birla to contribute money to wipe out untouchability,and he hesitated to accept money from Harijans, but all the same he accepted it, since they voulnteered it, but, added the Mahatma, he would have preferred  it if the Harijans had given up liquor or smoking and contributed those savings for Harijan work. The money thus contributed would have been more helpful in the noble mission. He recalled, in this connection, the contribution raised by Bhopal students yesterday by raising a pie-fund.
 Continuing, the Mahatma said the Hindus, in patronizing the  Harijan movement, were really doing a penance (prayashchitta) for their age-long sins, and this penance must be sincere. If they failed to do it, God alone knew what their fate would be.
 
 Referring to the Harijan reform work done in the Birla Mills, Mahatmaji said :
 It is no news to me that you have wiped out untouchability in the Birla Mills. Ghanshyamdasji has merely paid the debt that he owed as a high-caste Hindu to the Harijans and as a millowner to labourers.
 It was the religious duty of every Hindu, be he a mill-owner or poor man, to root out untouchability from this land. In doing so, they were merely doing their duty and did not deserve any thanks.
 Continuing, the Mahatma sounded a note of warning in the following words :
 Wipe out untouchability or Hinduism will be wiped out from the world.
 Referring to some sanatanists, who did not agree with him in this reform movement, Mahatmaji said :
 I have tried my best to persuade sanatanists to my view and have given my best attention to their arguments, but they have failed to convince me by a single proof from the Shastras giving sanction to untouchability.
 Continuing, the Mahatma appealed to the labourers to give up liquor, smoking and other evil practices and lead a pure life internally as well as externally. He laid stress on God’s worship and added that faith in God alone could put an end to their sorrows. He concluded with a prayer for the welfare of labourers, saying that he also regarded himself as a labourer by choice. It was better to be a labourer than to be an employer. (Cheers)
 The Mahatma humorously remarked :
 I feel very much tempted to finish the fruit, but give it to Harijan children and they will reach me.

   DISCUSSION WITH HARIJANS  
 DELHI,
 December 10, 1933
 Q. Do you consider temple-entry as the only way to solve our troubles ?
 A. It is my firm belief that caste Hindus will not have fulfilled their obligations till they have opened all their temples to Harijans. It is immaterial to me whether Harijans come to worship in those temples or not. It is a matter of sheer justice and penance for caste Hindus. It is repugnant to my sense of justice that Harijans should be excluded
 from places of worship which are open to other Hindus. I would not consider untouchability as having been eradicated, unless and until the bar against Harijans’ entry into temples is removed altogether.
 Q. Will you not help us in our economic distress ? To us economic uplift is the chief thing.
A. The economic uplift has not been overlooked. But I should
 not be satisfied if you were given crores of rupees and yet were still considered untouchables, or if palaces were built for you and you were still kept out of the pale of Hindu society. I should be satisfied only when you are put on a par with caste Hindus in every respect. Thus economic uplift is only one of the many items in our pro- gramme.
 Q. We should not conceal from you our misgivings about the money collected by you being properly used for our welfare. It depends upon your getting honest workers to work out the scheme, of whom there are very few at present. Would you not then put the funds into our hands to be used according to our discretion ? We must tell you frankly we do not trust the present workers.
A.  I  do  not mean to  say that no  Harijans can take part in the
 disbursement of the funds. But as the whole reform is conceived as a matter of penance and reparation on the part of caste Hindus, they have to find the best way of using them. They must be guided by the advice of Harijans, but the actual administration of the funds has to rest with them. I may assure you that the least part of these funds will be spent for propaganda. By far the greater part will go directly into the pockets of Harijans. I have no reason to believe that all those who are doing Harijan service today are actuated by selfish motives. There must be a few cases where workers are not as you and I would have them to be, but the majority have taken up this work in the proper spirit. Many of them are of unimpeachable character and would do credit to any movement. Apart from all this, however, I want you to visualize the conditions of thousands of Harijans who are so suppressed that they have fallen below the average standard of huma- nity. They are voiceless. They consider themselves sub-human. In Orissa, some years back,libtech_477_footnotelibtech_478_footnotean old man came to me with a straw in his mouth. I tried to awaken in him the sense that he was my equal as a human being. Another Harijan came to me in Cochin all trembling
 
 with fear. He was considered invisible in those parts and was afraid of coming into the world of touchables. These people are a standing reproach to us. In the work I am doing, I have these in mind. This service, then, has been taken up, not so much to please Harijans as to discharge a peremptory obligation. We want to wipe out our shame and to die in that effort if need be. We are striving to the best of our ability to render you selfless service, but if Harijans do not accept it, I shall know that we are too late. But the month’s experience convinces me that the vast majority gladly accept this service. We do not wish to leave a single phase of your life untouched. We approach you as servants and not as patrons.
 Q. You have only added a new name ‘Harijan’ to the many names we already had. Even this new name is significant of our separateness from the others. Unless this sense of separateness goes, in fact as well as in name, how are we to be satisfied ?
 The name ‘Harijan’ was suggested by one of your own class. 
 Thousands have welcomed the name as a good substitute for the offensive names ‘untouchable’ and ‘avarna’. So long as untoucha- bility is not completely removed, a name to distinguish you from others will be required, and an inoffensive name is any day better than one that stinks in the nostrils. When untouchability is gone and Harijans are merged into the Hindus, I do not know by what name— Harijan or Hindu—the whole community will choose to call itself, but till that day comes, distinguishing names will have to be used. You should know that I have become a Harijan by choice and am trying to serve you as one of yourselves; and I am sure that the sevice will, in the end, be accepted by all Harijans, if I have offered it in a selfless spirit. I would plead with you for a little more patience to see what is being done. The Harijan Sevak Sangh has no other end in view but your good.

    LETTER TO MANILAL AND SUSHILA GANDHI       DELHI, 
     CHI. 	MANILAL AND SUSHILA,  December 	10, 1933 
  	I got the letters of you both. Which remarks of mine hurt so much ? 	I don’t remember what I said to Kishorelal, but I have never 
 thought you timid or cowardly. On the contrary, I have always been proud of your courage.But I do think that you are too dependent on others, that you do not have sufficient capacity to think for yourself. But that is not your fault. Partly it may be mine. You have nothing to feel ashamed about. I wrote a long letter to you by the last mail, from which you will be able to know clearly my views in this regard. Even your seeking my advice from here is a sign of your feeling of dependence.
 If you make a mistake, I will not blame you even in my thoughts. I would do that if you betrayed the trust reposed in you. I do wish that you should keep the promises which you may have made to the people or to friends. I am not at all afraid of your present course. At the most the result would be your financial ruin. Let it be so. But don’t let people think that you acted foolishly. If you feel that you have made a mistake, admit it and free yourself. It is not as easy for me to give advice in this matter as you seem to think. If it were so, why wouldn’t I advise you immediately ?
 And now regarding your expenses. My remarks were not meant as criticism nor did they express my pain. I only wished to say that, having lived there in a certain manner, you could not easily change your mode of life here. I don’t wish that you should try our manner of life here at the cost of the health of all three of you. You yourself have calculated your monthly requirement at Rs. 150. I have put it at Rs. 200. But now even Rs. 150 can be obtained only as a favour. I would rather that you lived on plain fare than that you should depend on anybody’s favour. In short I am not satisfied with your way of life.  I know that Sushila is much more careful than you in this matter. After reading your letters, I even felt like sending a cable to you asking you not to worry. But with whose money would that have been
 ? How can a poor father send a cable to reassure his son? I, therefore, content myself with this letter. Have no fear of me, either of you. Live as both of you may think proper. Even if you cannot continue to live there despite your sincere efforts and come over here, God  will  provide you means of livelihood. Do whatever you do after independent thinking.
 Nimu is pregnant again. Ramdas feels extremely miserable. I have tried to comfort him. A man and a woman cannot succeed in this aim without hard effort. But Ramdas is a weak man and thinks too much, so that even his weakness makes him unhappy.
 Probably you know that Lakshmi also is pregnant. I came to know these facts about both of them only recently. I come to know about such things only after some time. Ba is happy in jail. Manibehn is with her. I am all right.

 What is it you want ? It is a matter of a few days. But I don’t wish to keep you if that upsets you or makes you unhappy. After all, later on you have to go to Wardha. But if you want to go to Multan I would not stop you. I want to make you happy and brave somehow. If  I send you back to Wardha, I will do so only after making all the arrangements, otherwise we shall see what can be done. I will not send you to Bhavnagar. Dudhibehn’s programme is not certain. As long as  I am here there is no such hurry. Shall talk tomorrow in the morning after my silence is over.

  	I got your letter, as also Jayaprakash’s. If both of you come to a 	firm decision that you would dedicate yourselves to service, I shall 	have nothing to say. I only explained to you both that it was not 	morally wrong to do one’s duty towards one’s own family, but 	that, if one wished to follow the path of service, one must renounce 	such private duties.libtech_481_footnote  	If you try to do both, you will probably fail in both. There will be 	no difficulty in sending Rs. 50 every month for Rajeshwar.libtech_482_footnoteBut that does not satisfy me.What arrangement have 	you made for your own expenses ? What have you decided regarding the 	debt ? By solving these problems anyhow, you will not have solved 	the basic     
 problem. But I will not dwell further on this matter. I don’t wish to discourage Jayaprakash. We should hope that, since his motive is pure, everything will be all right.
 You have not yet gone and seen Mother. You should do so now. Since your visit to me has been delayed so long, I shall now be far away. If you do not wish to get arrested there, you may come and see me during my Andhra tour, and then from Wardha you may go wherever you like. I think it would be best to go to Bihar. If you decide to go to Bihar, it is not very necessary for you to come and see me. If, however, you are very keen to come, by all means do come. I leave it entirely to your own wish. I shall be in Madras on 20, 21 and
 I 	will start from here on 	the 14th. 	From the 16th 	to the 	19th, I 	shall be 	around Bezwada. I 	shall be 	back in 	Andhra from 23rd to 	31st, and 	the headquarters will be 	at Bezwada. You 	may now decide as 	you like. 
 Vidya felt bored and has come here. She has brought Kanta with her. I have not decided yet whether to let Vidya go to Multan or ask her to return to Wardha.
 Om has been with me. I continue the same diet. The quantity of milk varies from three pounds to one pound. The cold which I had has gone. The weight was 108 pounds when I was weighed in  Jabalpur. I have not been weighed after that. You need not worry about me at all. God will keep me in whatever condition. He wishes and get work done through me as He wills.

  304. DISCUSSION WITH SANATANISTS      DELHI, 
  December 	13, 1933  	I claim to be a sanatanist as I consider my conduct to be in 	consonance with the spirit of the scriptures.libtech_485_footnoteYou may, if you like, reject my claim. I have studied 	the Shastras to the best of my ability and have arrived at the 	conclusion that untouchability is repugnant to the spirit of 	Hinduism.  They, 	however, contended that no one could be called sanatanist who did 	not believe in untouchability, shraddha, 	idol-worship and 	other outward observances. Gandhiji retorted that the only true test 	of sanatan dharma was the touchstone of truth. He added that the 	outward observance was nothing if a man lived a crooked life. What 	did outward form avail to a man who was a drunkard, rake and gambler 	?  When 	he was told that the attempt to have temples opened to Harijans was 	bound to lead to bloodshed, he said that was practically impossible, 	as there was no compulsion contemplated by anybody. No temple was to 	be opened where the overwhelming opinion of temple-goers was not in 	favour of such opening.  Harijan, 	22-12-1933    305. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, ALIPUR  December 	13, 1933  	I would ask you to believe me when I say that there is no political 	motive behind my Harijan work. The political consequences of the 	removal of untouchability have no attraction for me. Indeed, I 	believe that, if we approached this question with a political 	motive, we should fail to serve the Harijans and we should damage 	Hinduism. That real removal of untouchability will have political 	consequences is true enough. A duty religiously performed carries 	with it many other important consequences. ‘Seek ye first the 	Kingdom of God and everything else will be added unto you’, is to 	my mind a scientific truth. I 	must remind you of the pledge given last year in your name.    
 You will remember that a meeting of representatives of Hinduism was held in Bombay in September last year, Pandit Malaviyaji being in the chair. Among other things they resolved that untouchability, being a blot on the Hindu religion, had to be removed and that Harijans were entitled to the same public utilities, and in the same manner, as caste Hindus. There was in that Resolution a special reference to Hindu temples, and legislation was contemplated if it was found to be necessary for attaining the end. It is, therefore, the bounden duty of every caste Hindu to fulfil the pledge by throwing open to  the  Harijans temples, well and other institutions precisely on the same terms as they are open to caste Hindus.

 306. DISCUSSION AT SERVANTS OF UNTOUCHABLES SOCIETY MEETINGlibtech_486_footnote
 DELHI,
 December 13, 1933
 Regarding the utilization of collections made during the tour Mahatma Gandhi said that 75 percent of these collections would be spent in the locality concerned so far as possible provided a suitable scheme was prepared and approved by the Central Board. The Provincial Boards should, however, not neglect their ordinary collections in the hope of getting money out of his collections. He stressed :
You dare not utilize any part of these collections for propa-
 ganda or office administration. They can be utilized to the single pie for constructive work alone. I am not touring India to finance your offices or to help your propaganda but to raise money enough for constructive work alone. You should collect money separately to meet the expenses of your office administration. If you do work out of the funds that I raise, the money paid by the public would be returned to them hundredfold. It should, therefore, be zealously guarded and cautiously spent.
 Asked as to what opinion he could express about the work done so far, Mahatma Gandhi replied :
You cannot get any compliments if you want to get them. But I
 can say that you could have done the work much better and as for the future I can only say that you should do better than in the past.
 
 Regarding the question of democratization of the constitution of the Society, Mahatma Gandhi said that the present constitution should be worked democratically rather than bringing in a constitution demorcratic in form but autocratic in spirit.
 His Holiness Garmuria Gosain of Assam and Mr. D. N. Sharma explained that ex-tea-garden coolies belonged to various provincess of India and were mostly Harijans. Their population in Assam was 10,50,000 out of whom only 5,000 were literate. They were commonly addicted to liquor or other such vices. They had been economically exploited by Kabulis and Marwaris.
 Mahatma Gandhi said that he knew about this deplorable state.
 It is a social problem but to me it seems that the harvest is ready but the labourers are few. We require workers to solve this question. It cannot be solved by law. It requires work in the midst of these people from day to day without expectation of immediate result. It would be better to prepare statistics of these men by provinces so that a way might be found out to invite workers from other provinces to go there and work. Money alone will not give the kind of workers required. If  I succeed in reaching Assam I will study the conditions and try to raise some local workers. If I fail in this, I would have no doubt that Assam is the most backward of all provinces. The question is, however, not only of untouchability but of a different type, but if Assam produces the proper type of workers there will be no difficulty in getting funds enough for carrying on that work.

 307. SPEECH AT STUDENTS ’ MEETING, DELHIlibtech_487_footnote
 December 13, 1933 It is no exaggeration to say that our relations were as intimate as between blood-brothers.libtech_488_footnotelibtech_489_footnoteHis burning patriotism,  his  great  sacrifice
and his unsurpassable love for his children, whom also he gave to the
 service of the motherland, ought to be as patent to you as they were to me. I had the good fortune to be in the closest touch with him ever since I first knew him up to the moment of his death; and I could see that every moment of his life his thoughts were given to the nation he served so singularly. To him swaraj was no distant dream; it was his very life-breath. His hankering after freedom grew in intensity from day to day. It is, therefore, in the fitness of things that you should
 
 have before your eyes the portrait of such a great patriot, so that you may be constantly reminded of his sterling qualities and try to assimilate them in your own lives. No lip homage paid to a patriot you admire will be of any use to you, if you do not mean to imitate the virtues that made him great. Your keeping his portrait before you must be significant of your resolve to follow in his footsteps. Remember, too, that he was above all distinctions of high and low. He never gave a place to untouchability in his long and varied life. He had the heart of a prince. He knew how to earn as well as to give away.
 He then asked the students to give a more tangible proof than money of their love for the Harijans by clearing the Augean stables, in other words, the Harijan bastis of Delhi. He had seen the terrible contrast between the palaces of New Delhi, where money had been poured out like water, and the veritable hells in which the Harijans were forced to live; and he spoke with an agony too deep for words.
 I saw three bastis out of four, one of them being the worst of all.
 One cannot imagine, unless one has been with one’ own eyes, that there can be such a place for human habitation. I have no words to describe the filth and ugliness I saw there. It is enough to give one a feeling of nausea. You should gird up your loins and clean these plague-spots. I was happy to learn that there are among you students who have a desire to serve the Harijans by physical labour also. When you have removed the filth from the bastis, you will discover many other ways of most useful service.

 308. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
 DELHI
 Wednesday, December 13, 1933 I   have  just  read   Sir   Mohammed   Iqbal’s   answerlibtech_490_footnotelibtech_491_footnoteto  Shri Jawaharlal  Nehru’s   indictmentlibtech_492_footnotelibtech_493_footnoteof   the  communal  spirit  whether
among Muslims of Hindus in so far as they may be represented by
 their sectarian organizations. Reluctant though I am to intervene in the controversy, I may not leave unchallenged the statements made by Sir. Mohammed Iqbal ragarding me.
 
 My position in Londonlibtech_494_footnotewas clear. I was helpless for effective action on communal matters without Dr. Ansari. I was bound by the Congress mandate and before I could recommend any modification I should need Dr. Ansari’s guidance. Having forfeited, for the time being, Maulana Shaukat Ali’s confidence, I told Muslim friends that Dr. Ansari held ‘my conscience on Muslim matters in his pocket’ and that therefore they should co-operate with me in securing his presence at the Conference. To this they would not agree, unless I would first accept their demands. My effort having failed, I tried every other resource at my disposal to achieve real unity and hopelessly failed.
 The offer to act as camp-followers to the Congress seemed then, as it has proved since, to be a mockery. Behind the talks, there was an oppressive sense of unreality. What Sir Mohammed Iqbal calls two conditions attached to my personal acceptance of Muslim demands, were no conditions but the necessary consequence of my acceptance. Political unity was desired for a political end which for me, as for any Indian be he Hindu, Muslim, Christian or any other, could only be complete national independence in the fullest sense of the term. Muslim demands were presented for arriving at common action. Muslim friends in London were playing other minorities against the vital national interest. If they accepted me as their ally, as I offered to be in uttermost sincerity, my alliance could only be for combating every force that was inimical to India’s freedom. It was, therefore, necessary to fight the spirit of separateness, no matter from  what source it arose.
 No Muslim had defended separate electorates as a thing good in itself. Even in their case, Muslim friends had admitted it as a necessary evil to be tolerated for a temporary period. The doctrine, therefore, did not admit of indefinite extension. The demand put forth on behalf of the so-called untouchables was clearly anti-national. But if it was consistent with national interest or was necessary for the protection of the Harijan interest, my resistance was truly inhuman as Sir Moha- mmed Iqbal characterizes it. But in that case, Muslim friends should not even have offered to be neutral if I accepted their demands. But I hold that my resistance was not only not ‘inhuman’ but it was conceived in the best interests of the Harijans.
I claim to be a Harijan by choice. I do not yield to the tallest
 
 
 Harijan in the desire to conserve the Harijan interest. Evidently Sir Mohammed Iqbal has had no time to follow what I have done or am doing in this behalf. Had he even cursorily followed my doings, he would not have allowed himself to say, as he has said, that “Mr. Gandhi has made it a mission of his life to prevent the fusion of the untouchables with the other communities and to retain them in the fold of Hinduism without any real fusion between them and even the caste Hindus.” He should know that the rooting out of untouchability is the aim of my life which I have persued without interruption for the past fifty years and that I have claimed and am fighting for the same rights without reservation for the Harijans that the caste Hindus have in matters religious, social and political.
 My work about Harijans is purely religious. It has no political motive behind it. It is essentially humanitarian in the highest sense of the term. It is a movement of internal reform in Hinduism. It is one of expiation and reparation by caste Hindus for inhumanities heaped upon the outcastes of Hindu society. My Hinduism, like my nation- alism, is not exclusive or inconsistent with the interest of any portion of humanity. I would refuse to call that freedom which may involve the sacrifice of Muslim or any other interest that is not hostile to the freedom of India. I approached every question in London in that spirit.
 My belief in the necessity of communal unity is just as firm as ever before. What could I do now, it may be asked. My position is the same now as before. I would accept any solution that may commend itself to the Muslims as a whole and that is not in conflict with any other national interest. Naturally, I endorse the suggestion made by Shri Jawaharlal Nehru. Nothing can be fairer. As a nationalist I claim to represent all communities equally, the largest as well as the smallest.

 309. SPEECH AT HARIJANS’ MEETING, DELHIlibtech_495_footnote
 December 14, 1933
 It is not to keep you segregated that the schools are  being opened and wells are being dug for you. All this is being  done because I cannot bear to see you get no water at all. How can I tolerate that the Harijans get water from the same trough from which dogs and cattle drink water ? You belong to the cities and perhaps get water from the taps. But in villages, the caste Hindus are so arrogant that they do not permit the Harijans to go near the wells at all. Even when they give them water, they do so from a distance and with words of abuse. You and I ought not to tolerate such a thing. Wells are being dug for Harijans not to keep them as untouchables, but in order that they may at least get clean water. And these wells are not exclusively for the Harijans. Others too can draw water from them. But the  Harijans have a right to use them. They oughts not to have to take water from a trough. The fact is, we have not been able to dig as many wells for them as are needed. And you also see that  many  caste Hindus are voluntarily opening their wells for the use of Harijans. The same is true about schools. Our efforts to get Harijans admitted to the general schools are continuing. But till such time as we can  get Harijans admitted into all general schools, the question is whether we should open separate schools for them or let their children remain without education. That is why we are opening schools for them. Other children also are welcome to join these schools. But the Harijans at any rate have the fullest right to join them.
 By calling you Harijans, we have given you a sweet name in place of an offensive one. Many Harijans have accepted it. It is a better name than the offensive word “untouchable”. And the name was suggested by a Harijan. It at least avoids the discourtesy involved in addressing somebody by an offensive name. When untouchability has disappeared, either all Hindus would call themselves ‘Harijans’ or the Harijans would be completely absorbed in the Hindu society. The third alternative is that the Hindu community itself would be wiped out. But it is to avert this danger that a great effort is being made
 
 
 today. That is the work being carried on by the Harijan Sevak Sangh for the eradication of untouchability.
 I am happy that I have come to the Shraddhananda Colony. Is there any Hindu who is unfamiliar with the name of the late Shraddhanandaji ? There can hardly be anyone who feels the love and kindness for Harijans which Shraddhanandaji did. He was extremely unhappy that the Hindus in their arrogance had created a class of untouchables. The Hindu community will have to wash away that sin or perish. You should help in washing off that sin. Take this message to other Harijans, too. Contribute your mite to this yajna of self- purification which is being carried on. Maintain both outer and inner purity. Give up eating carrion and beef. These three things you must definitely do. The fourth thing is that you must give up liquor. Give it up even if other Hindus drink. You have been degraded by others and you have to rise by your own efforts. That is why I appeal to you to give up liquor. Please do this much and persuade other Harijans also to do it. You have presented a purse to me. But I do not want a single pie from the Harijans. It is we who have to give to you. We owe you a debt. However, I have accepted the purse since you have given it. The sum would be returned to you many times over. It is, however, not necessary for you to give anything.

 310. SPEECH AT WOMEN’S MEETING, DELHI
 December 14, 1933 In the eyes of God who is the Creator of all, His creatures are all equal. Had He made any distinctions of high and low between man
and man, they would have been visible as are the distinctions between,
 say, an elephant and an ant. But he has endowed all human beings impartially with the same shape and the same natural wants. If you consider Harijans untouchables because they perform sanitary service, what mother has not performed such service for her children ? Does she then become an untouchable on that score ? As she can become pure after a wash, sweepers also can come under the same rule.libtech_496_footnotelibtech_497_footnoteIt is the height of in- justice to consider the Harijans, who are the most
 
 useful servants of society, as untouchables and outcastes. I have undertaken this tour to awaken the minds of Hindu sisters to a sense of this sin. It can never be an act of merit to look down upon any human being as inferior to us. We are all worshippers of one God, whom we worship under different names. We must , therefore, realize our essential unity and give up untouchability as well as the spirit of superiority and inferiority between human beings.

 311. WHAT I SAW IN ANANTPUR
 Anantpur is a little village in Saugor District, C. P. (Hindi), containing 177 houses with a population, therefore, roughly of 885. It is 35 miles from the nearest railway station. It has no Post  or  Telegraph Office. There is a weekly service from the nearest Post Office, Relly, 12 miles from Anantpur. It is a typically poor village of poor India. The villagers are occupied not more than four months in the year. There was hardly any supplementary occupation for the villagers as a whole before an event that happened four years ago.
 It was in 1929 that a young man, with a single-minded zeal rarely surpassed, chose Anantpur for his experiment, after a year’s travelling in search of such a village. He is khaddar mad. He believes in the message of khaddar even as much as perhaps I do. I doubt if he would not replace ‘perhaps’ by ‘if not more than’. I would submit to his correction, if he made it. His faith in himself would put to shame the tallest among us. He believes that the only permanent cure for the enforced idleness of the peasantry of India and their consequent chronic poverty is the universal adoption of the spinning-wheel. His name is Jethalal Govindjee. He does not know English. He is no Gujarati scholar. Himself a town-bred man, by dogged pertinacity he has inured himself to the hardships of village life and lives like, and in the midst of, villagers. He has three companions with him. He is a thorough believer in one thing at a time and, therefore, will not pursue other social service, no matter how tempting it may be. If the spinning-wheel is well-established in every cottage, he thinks that all the other problems that puzzle and drag down villagers will solve themselves. He will say : ‘I shan’t preach temperance or thrift to the villager, for no drunkard will take to the wheel if he will not give up his drink, and to preach thrift to a pauper is a mockery. It will be time
 
 to preach it, when I have put a few coppers in his pocket. Since I believe that every revolution of the wheel will mean a revolution in his daily life, I am going to be patient with his vices and many drawbacks. And I have faith that, if I am a clean man, my cleanness cannot but touch both the inside and the outside of the villager.’ With varying fortunes, but with an unvarying faith, he and his companions have plodded for the past four years. Their formula is Self-dependence writ large. Khadi must support itself. The way to make it do so is for the villagers to spin, and weave too if possible, for their own use. They may sell only the surplus, as they do with the grain they grow. No cloth can be cheaper than that spun and woven in one’s home, even as no bread can be cheaper than home-baked from grain grown in one’s own field and ground in one’s own home. The business of these servants of the villagers is merely to instruct and help. They visit every cottage and offer to teach them ginning, spinning, carding, weaving and dyeing. They improve their wheels and manufacture new ones for sale only from the material available in the village. This has given extra work to the village carpenter and the village blacksmith. Every item is well thought out. They have an almost complete record of the condition of every cottage and its dwellers. They have made a fairly accurate study of the villagers’ wants and woes, customs and manners, and have published their report in Hindi. Their workshop is a busy hive. Work is being done in a neat and methodical  manner.  A common log-book is kept containing a day-to-day summary of the work done by each worker. I have mentioned only four foundation workers. Needless to say they have raised workers in seventeen villages they are serving within a five-mile radius of Anantpur.
 A word as to the condition of the cottages I saw. I visited over six, including one belonging to a Harijan. I may not omit to mention that the Harijans have been found to be the readiest to take to the message.
 The cottages I saw were low roofed, with walls made of mud. There was no ventilation in them worth mentioning, no boxes, hardly any metal pots. The inmates were in rags, except where they had made khaddar for themselves. The only belonging I saw consisted generally of empty mud granaries to contain grain for the year. One room served as kitchen, dwelling and the rest. Their beds were straw covered with rags, again except where they had woven khaddar for themselves. Their food consists of jawar chapatis and a pulse, with or without oil. Of milk and ghee they hardly ever have anything. The Chamar whose
 cottage I saw was an exception. He sported two cows. Whether he or his children ever get a drop of milk for themselves is another story. The villagers were poorly fed and worse clothed. Some children go stark naked from year’s end to year’s end. They warm themselves in the sun by day and before a wretched fire at night. There are families in Anantpur who, I am told, started this khaddar industry literally with an investment of one pice for cotton. This was doubled the next day by the sale of yarn spun from one pice worth of cotton and thus by progressive realization they are able now to have their own clothes.
 I translate the following from the leaflet prepared for  the occasion of my visit :
The following is the cost of the complete outfit :
 
        Ginning 				machine   Rs.   0-7-0     Carding 				bow with gut and striker    				’’   0-9-6     Spinning-wheel 				with spindle    				’’   0-6-6     Winding 				frame    				’’   0-1-0     Handloom 				for 32 inches width with all accessories    				’’   3-0-0     Total       4-8-0    
 We serve seventeen villages lying within a five-mile radius, containing 1,100 cottages with a population of 5,500 in round numbers. As a result of our labours, eighty per cent of the population have learnt spinning, sixty percent have learnt carding.
Over hundred persons have learnt weaving.
 The average strength of yarn has now reached fifty-six, the average count ten.
 Their average working days are hundred and twenty during the year, the balance of the time lying quite idle. Of the idle hours, now an individual gives on an average five hundred hours during the year to khaddar work. Our ideal is to reach 1,600 hours per year.
 The progress of our work now depends upon our ability to raise more workers. We have today three principal workers, three assistants, five sub-assistants, five helpers and four candidates.
 Our average monthly expense is Rs. 325 found by the All India Spinners’ Association.
 I bring this great experiment to the notice of the public to show not only what it means to Harijans but also to all villagers. The aim of
 the experiment is not exclusively Harijan service, it is service of the under-fed and the under-clothed, exclusively through the spinning- wheel. I have known nothing simpler, cheaper and yet more effective than this experiment of village uplift through khaddar. The progress seems to be undoubtedly slow just now, but I expect that it will be found to be the quickest in the end.

 312. THINGS TO REMEMBER
 During the past month of touring there has been a great deal of waste of time, a great deal of anxiety to the organizers and a great and unnecessary strain on my very limited physical resources, owing to the mad rush made towards the passing car. I cannot recall occasions when people near me have not trodden on my naked toes or scratched my legs. God has saved me from serious injury hitherto. But the crowds can take no credit for the immunity. Their affection is mad. And madness can do nobody any good. The thing can be easily managed if the volunteers will act in a business-like manner and will not themselves, like crowds, go mad as they often do. People cannot be instructed on anything all of a sudden. Leaflets containing detailed instructions should, therefore, be issued to the public and read and explained to them by volunteers as they come to the venue of  meetings. The very best arrangement of the kind was made at Harda. Although the party was taken through a crowded and decorated bazaar, it took no more than ten minutes to pass through. In other places the same distance has often taken more than half an hour. Success at Harda was due not merely to previous preparations, but also to volunteers with one continuous rope held by them being posted at regular intervals, thus making it impossible for anyone to break through the lines. Let me now without further comment tabulate the instructions which I suggest for general adoption.
   Leaflets 		containing detailed instructions should be 		issued to 		the villagers 		in simple 		language easily 		to be understood 		by them. 		These should be read to the parties as they stream in from villages.  Crowds 		that gather at stations 		awaiting my arrival 		should stand 		in rows upon rows without causing 		inconvenience to 		the passengers and 		without moving 		from their 		places  when  the  		train steams in.  A 		few minutes 		before the arrival 		time, volunteers 		should be posted 		in front 		of the crowd 		with a continuous 		rope, held waist-high in 		their hands in order 		to avoid 		the people 		behind unconsciously moving 		towards me 		and the train. Volunteers 		should on no account 		fall prostrate before me.  Volunteers 		should never lead 		or take 		part in 		the various cries. 		Apart from its 		interfering with 		efficient service, their leading or 		participating in 		them robs the 		cries of spontaneity.  Volunteers 		should not shout their 		instructions to 		the public, 		but should pronounce 		them with deliberation 		and gentleness. 		Only one 		volunteer detailed for 		the purpose should 		pronounce them. The 		public should be 		requested not 		to crowd round the 		cars.  Volunteers 		should not board 		my or any 		other car, except 		when asked 		to do 		so by 		a responsible 		member of 		the Reception 		Committee.  The 		public should not 		gather at 		the stations 		which I 		may be 		passing through between 		8 p. 		m. and 6 		a. m., 		and in no case 		should they shout the 		usual cries at 		night. Such shouting 		during night betrays 		want of 		consideration for 		the passengers and 		the party whom 		they profess 		to respect.  Those 		who gather 		at stations whether by 		day or  night 		would do well 		to remember 		that I am not 		conducting a 		tour for 		receiving addresses. It 		is intended to 		be wholly a call for 		self purification, 		an invitation 		to the 		so-called high 		class Hindus to 		repent of 		the wrong 		done by 		them to 		Harijans and 		for making collections 		on behalf 		of the 		cause. Therefore, 		those who 		gather at 		the stations 		are naturally expected to bring or collective donations for Harijan service.

  LETTER TO AGATHA HARRISON 
 Unrevised	December 15, 1933
 MY DEAR AGATHA,
 I am writing this in a moving train in the early morning. Mira is just now off writing regular mail letters. She cannot combine nursing, cooking, bottle-washing, proof-reading for Harijan and European and American correspondence, without breaking to pieces.
 Your letters are valuable.
 What you say about Bhulabhai Desai’s work does not surprise. I had expected nothing less.
 As to the imaginary interview in Rome, of course, I never saw the reaffirmation by the Rome pressman.libtech_498_footnoteI was in prison. But if I see the first statement and the reaffirmation, I would be able to throw light on it. That those who won’t believe will receive no help is only too true. But that does not matter. I must satisfy honest doubters. The quickest way for you is for yourself or some friend to secure the Times file and copy the two statements and send them on to me before 3rd August nextlibtech_499_footnote. Long enough notice for you!
 It will be a good thing if your effort results in Bose being allowed to go to England. Why he is kept out [of] London I cannot understand.
 The usual cuttings accompany this. The orthodox opposition to the reform is slowly getting out of the bewilderment in which the phenomenal mass attendances at the meetings found it. Though they are very few so far as I can judge they have money to sustain them. They are therefore trying to create disturbances at meetings. But I hope to be able to cope with the opposition.
 The political situation remains much the same as before. The official mind is revealed in the speech of the Commissioner of Burdwan.
Love.

  DISCUSSION WITH A SANATANISTlibtech_505_footnote 
 [Before December 16, 1933]
 You should realize that there are shastris who claim to be sana- tanists and who support the reformers’ contention. How am I to reject their testimony as false? They fortify me in my opinion that untouchability has no sanction in the shastras. I do believe in the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Smritis and the Puranas. But to me the Gita is the key to a knowledge of the Shastras. It enunciates the principles on which all conduct must be based. It sums up the whole of the Shastras and, therefore, absolves laymen from having to explore the other books. But I go a step further. The Vedas are not the four books known as such. They contain only fragments of the originals. Eternal truth cannot be buried in or confined to printed books. The Vedas are, therefore, indefinable and unwritten. They reside in one’s heart. And our Shastras tell us what discipline and study are necessary for opening out the heart for receiving the truth. One’s experience, therefore, must be the final guide. The written word undoubtedly helps, but even that has to be interpreted and, when there are conflicting interpretations, the seeker is the final arbiter. I had to make my choice. Years ago I made it and came to the conclusion that the Shastras did not countenance untouchability as we practise it today.
 Harijan, 22-12-1933
 
  SPEECH AT HARIJAN WORKERS’ MEETING 
 VIJAYAWADA,
 December 16, 1933
 It gave him great pleasure, [Gandhiji] said, to have met them all and witnessed the evidences of their literary powers. He had always known, he said, that the people of Andhradesha were good at composing poems and rendering them sweetly and as such he could not help feeling that the recitations witnessed that evening were to some extent useless. Poetry and art should be the vehicle of truth and never be utilized  for flattery. For, such a use of poetry would not only make for degeneration of the art but would also be a violation of truth. Now that they were all engaged in a movement for the purification of Hinduism, he expected everyone so engaged to tread the path of
 
 
 truth. He had great expectations of Andhradesh and he knew she could rise equal to them.libtech_506_footnote
 Be you caste Hindu or Harijan, let what contribution you are making to the Harijan cause be absolutely unalloyed. There can be no room for selfishness, hypocrisy, untruth and violence in such a movement. As a religious movement it ought to touch the hearts of Harijans and savarnas alike. For hundreds of years considerations of high and low have gone deep into our hearts. Religious weapons alone kill untouchability.
 An array of Hindu saints and sages have taught us that penance was the only way to protect and purify religion. Needless to say that there can be place for selfishness and egoism in a penance. I hope and pray that those engaged in Harijan service will be guided by the purest of motives.libtech_507_footnote
 He appealed to all those savarnas and avarnas who were engaged in this work
 to realize the paramount importance of self-purification and to look upon this work as a shuddhiyajna.libtech_508_footnote
 Mr. Shambu Sastri asked if Gandhiji accepted the authority of the Vedas.
Most certainly.
 You respect them and abide by them?
Certainly.
 The next question was whether he would accept the position that Harijans if admitted to temples should also abide by the injunctions of Shastras by which temples were regulated.
All Shastric rules that apply to savarnas when observed by
Harijans must enable them to get entry into temples.libtech_509_footnote
 All my past and present actions have been in accordance with religion as I have understood it. I have no doubt that the present endeavour for the removal of untouchability has Vedic authority behind it. I must, however, admit that there are two schools of thought on this question. Both claim to be sanatanists and base their opinions on the Hindu scriptures.
 I hold that those who are conducting this drive against untouchability as a religious movement must treat their opponents
 
 with tolerance give them always a dispassionate and patient hearing and in no case show any anger in word or deed. We are out to convert them. Let us seek their help and co-operation too. I implicitly believe that they will one day join us if only we worked with scrupulous care in a religious spirit. Our hearts should be full of love for them and if we are pure we are sure to win their hearts.

  SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, VIJAYAWADA 
 December 16, 1933
 After apologizing for his inability to make himself heard by  them  all, Gandhiji acknowledged with thanks the several addresses presented to him and their monetary accompaniments.
But would it not have been better if all the purses had been
 pooled into one ? We could have saved several precious minutes thereby but it is our misfortune that it was not done. People wish to present addresses and purses each in his own name or in the name of his village,although all of us belong to the same country and are in the same condition.
 Proceeding, Gandhiji stated that so far Bezwada had contributed in cash about Rs. 3,982-8-0 and he was sure that before he left them, the figure would be rounded off into Rs. 5,000. This he knew would not be a great thing for the town to do. In this connection he could not help feeling the absence of Messrs A. Kaleswara Rao and Pattabhi Sitaramayya. But, they must pursue their path of duty and not drop Harijan work which had now become widespread and was an important item of work. Unless they destroyed the evil of untouchability, Hinduism, he feared, would die out. It was not dharma to consider a fellowman an “untouchable”. Harijans must have all rights that Savarnas enjoyed. They had committed a great sin by having kept Harijans out of their rights all these ages. savarnas must, therefore, he said expiate for the sin by undergoing a prayashchitta. Wherever he had gone on this tour he had witnessed huge concourses of people at similar meetings and he took it as a mark of their approval of the work he was carrying on. That people contributed their mite also pleased him. To
 the Harijans he would appeal for support not in monetary shape but in co-operating in this shuddhiyajna by observing external and internal purity. Internal purity could be attained by thinking of God and Ramanama and external purity through bath and other means of clean living. He would appeal to such of the Harijans as were addicted to drink, and eating carrion and cow-flesh, to give up these. No one who was addicted to
 
 these could be considered to be a Hindu and he could not be admitted into temples. Drinking was a heinous sin and a man under its influence could not distinguish between mother and wife.
 Before concluding, he referred to the address presented on behalf of the Andhra Hindi Pracharakas’ Association and said that he was immensely gratified to see the work carried on in Dakshina Bharat for promoting Hindi. He was also glad to note that in this matter Andhra led the rest of South India. He appealed to them all to help in the propagation of Hindi as it was an effective means of serving their country and their nation.

  SPEECH AT MUDUNURU 
 December 17, 1933
 Addressing the gathering, Gandhiji expressed his regret at not being able to stay in their midst longer than a few minutes or go into the temples for want of time and also the difficulty of getting out of and into the car at every place. He wished to save as much time as posssible as he had to cover a number of villages. If, therefore, he did not enter the temples, let them not go under the impression that he did not wish to enter the shrines of God. He was sure that the work he was doing was his work. he wished to open as many of the temples in this country as possible to Harijans. He hoped that Harijans would offer worship at the temples daily along with their other Hindu bretheren observing all the regulations that applied to savarnas and all the rules of cleanliness. By so doing and by giving up (where they were addicted to the habits) drink and carrion or beef-eating Harijans would be promoting real purification to Hinduism.libtech_510_footnote

  INTERVIEW TO “THE HINDU” libtech_511_footnote 
 SIDDHANTHAM,
 December 17, 1933
 May I ask a few questions on some points that strike me as worthy of being brought to your notice ?
 [GANDHIJI :] Most certainly, I am ready. Go ahead.
 In a recent meeting which he addressed in Madras Mr. M. K. Acharya has stated that 95 per cent of the Harijan do not want ‘ the Gandhian creed‘. What is your view on the matter ?
I do not know what ‘the Gandhian creed’ is. If I do not know it,
 how do the Harijans know it or Mr. Acharya himself? I do not claim anything special to me. There is no such thing as ‘Gandhian creed’ so far as I know. I know only this. I am engaged in giving Harijans clean water. I am engaged in giving them facilities for education. I am engaged in finding accommodation for them in public caravanserais where they cannot get it. I am engaged in weaning them from drink and carrion. Do they not like all these? I am engaged in teaching them the elementary rules of hygiene. Do they not want it ? I am engaged in telling them what the fundamentals of Hinduism are and in having public temples thrown open to them. Mark the distinction. They may not want to enter these temples and if somebody said that they do not want to, I will not be able to prove conclusively to the contrary, though the prima facie evidence that I have is all in my favour. Whenever they find temples are thrown open to them, they are simply delirious with joy, as I found them to be today when I opened two templeslibtech_512_footnoteand entered them with them. I do not care whether they want to go to the temples or no. I simply feel that savarnas should do their duty. There is nothing ‘Gandhian’ about it. Every Hindu who believes that untouchability must go must understand this work.
 It was observed by another person that Gandhiji being a believer in varnas- hrama, which was but a graded system of untouchability, he was not qualified to tackle this problem. What do you think of this view ?
For   me   varnashrama   does   not   mean   a   graded   system of
 untouchability. I have explained what I mean by varnadharma. It does
 
 not mean to me grades at all. It is not a vertical division. It is a hori- zontal one. In my view, all varnas stand absolutely on the same plane, i.e., of equality. Hence there can be no question of untouchability. Varnadharma is a mighty economic law which, if we subscribe to it, would save us from the catastrophe that is in store for the world. I have sufficient warrant in Hindu scriptures for saying that Brahmins and scavengers are absolutely on a par in the eyes of God.
 It has been suggested in some quarters that the Harijan movement is a form of civil resistance propaganda and that by this tour you are promoting civil resistance. What is your opinion on this suggestion ?
Then I am between two crossfires. Congressmen accuse me of
 having damaged the cause of civil disobedience by taking up this whirlwind campaign. Those who suspect me of ulterior motives accuse me of strengthening civil disobedience. I am unmoved by  these charges or insinuations, and can only re-declare that I have absolutely no ulterior motive. It is a peremptory religious call which I am  obeying. The tens of thousands who attend the meetings do not even hear the expression ‘civil resistance’ from my lips. This is purely a religious revival. This does not mean that I have changed my views on civil resistance. The very science of civil resistance demands absolute honesty. If I use this campaign for furthering civil resistance, I should be guilty of dishonesty. Civil disobedience does not need such dubious aids.
 What do you think of the progress of Harijan uplift work in the provinces you have toured so far ?
 My impressions are altogether happy and, if they are continued in the other provinces, I would have no hesitation in saying that untouchability is fast dying out. On no other basis can I account for the tens of thousands of people who flock to the meetings and give me their coppers, well knowing what these are to be used for.
 The Hindu, 18-12-1933
 
  SPEECH AT MASULIPATAM 
 December 17, 1933 Replying to the addresses and acknowledging the purses and other presents, Gandhiji said that on reaching Masulipatam his first thought was of Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya. He was sure the Doctor’s spirit was pervading at the meeting though he
 was not physically present in their midst. He thanked the District and Taluk Boards and the people of the district for the work they were doing on behalf of the Harijans. But he felt that so long as there was even a single temple which admitted savarnas but remained closed to Harijans, which benefited the former but did not equally benefit the latter, there would be no rest for him nor should there be any for them. If distinction  of high and low, touchable and untouchable continued amongst Hindus, he was sure
 Hinduism would slowly die out.libtech_513_footnote
 We shall dig our own grave if we do not purge ourselves of this curse of untouchability, we shall have to pay with bitter tears if we in our pride miss the God-given opportunity today. We should have no peace till this monster is buried and those whom we have hitherto kept under our heels are put on a par with us in every respect. Let us awake to the sense of this sin and save, before it is too late, ourselves and our religion from going to perdition.

  LETTER TO NARAHARI D. PARIKH 
 AS AT WARDHA,
 December 19, 1933
 CHI. NARAHARI,
 I am starting to write this letter at six in the morning in Masuli- patam. I get up daily at three and try to write as many letters as I can. The writing is interrupted at six, and at seven generally travelling is resumed. On Mondays and Tuesdays there is no travelling. Today is Tuesday, and so I have been able to continue to write. (After I had written so far, Malkani and Bapi Needu came up and took half an hour of my time.)
 I had preserved your long letter. Your work seems to be going on very well. I hope it will continue in the same manner. There are ebbs and tides in Mahadev’s work. He loudly sings “All days are not alike”. (Another interruption, and I gave 20 more minutes to Venka- tappayya.) Mahadev is now realizing the truth of that line in his own experience. That is how all of us learn and grow.
 Anandi and others are fairly well settled. Proper arrangements have been made for their study. Ramanama also is being taught by
 
 Shankarbhai and a music teacher. I get letters from Vanamala and Mohan. Mani has joined them. Bablo also is there, and so  are Qureshi’s children. N. has run away. Her son is in Sharda Mandir. Ba has been taken to Yeravda.
 All the questions which you have asked regarding spinning are relevant. But those problems cannot be solved at present. I can’t write about them now, either. I have in my mind the solutions of all the problems. Whether they will work or not can be discovered only when they are tried. If I am alive, I will explain them some day and, God willing, we will even try them.
 Kaka’s health is fairly good. He must have gone to Ahmedabad now. He was happy to stay with Swami for a few days. I have not heard from him recently.
 Kishorelal is quite ill. He is confined to bed.
 What experiences of the tour should I describe ? The crowds at the meetings are larger even than before and contribute generously to the fund.
 Surendra and Durbari are at Wardha. They will probably go to Karadi now. Both are fairly well. A large number of girls have joined at Wardha and requests are still being received. Vinoba continues to live in the hamlet. Balkrishna cannot be described as enjoying normal health. The same is true about Chhotelal.
 Blessings to all from

         BA,   LETTER TO KASTURBA GANDHI   December 	19, 1933   I  got your letter 	today. The letter addressed to Sabarmati  must 
  	have been received. I will continue to write to you regularly. I 	will write every Monday or Tuesday, for on those two days I get some 	free time. Take care of your health. I will send the slivers. If I 	don’t have any extra stock with me, I will get them from some 	source and send you. I have been having some blood pressure. I was 	examined by Dr. Ansari in Delhi. Do not at all worry about me. I 	will surely write to 
 Manilal and Sushila every fortnight. I wrote to them long letters. I will send your blessings to everyone. Do not worry about anybody. I have written to Manu also regarding Kusum. The latter is really ill and may or may not survive. Kishorelal has been having fever intermittently. He is in bed. Brijkrishna also has been bed-ridden for a long time. Devdas is well, and so also Rajaji. Give my blessings to all the women there. I hope all of them are doing physical work and maintaining good health. Ramanama is an unfailing remedy. I had prepared an abridged Gita for Ramdas. It is being printed. When it is ready, I will send a few copies there. If you want anything else, write to  me. Address your letters always to Wardha. I hope you are supplied newspapers.You have asked for a discourse from me. I will not send one this time. I will see if I can do so next week. It is certainly very good that you read the Gita regularly. Who teaches you to read it ? What food do you get there ? You remember don’t you, that you can write to Premlilabehnlibtech_514_footnotelibtech_515_footnoteor Trivedilibtech_516_footnotelibtech_517_footnotefor anything that you may   want. You will have fewer visitors there and so the best course will be that you should write one letter to me and receive one from me every week. However, you may do as you like. Om is all right. Premabehn’s friend, Kisan, has joined me recently. You remember her, don’t you ? She is very hard-working and has been well educated.

  LETTER TO AMRITLAL V. THAKKAR 
 MASULIPATAM,
 December 19, 1933
 BHAI THAKKAR BAPA,
 The	accompanying	letters	are	for	your	information. Bhagwanji’s argument is perfectly correct. I will write to him a
 
 suitable reply. Such activities will certainly be undertaken.
 I have still not received a copy of the resolution passed by you. Shouldn’t you send me one formally ? I shall be able to know about my duties from its wording.
 The work here is progressing rapidly. Malkani is fast becoming an accountant. He has also become a newspaper correspondent. If he maintains good health, he will work to the best of his ability.
 The crowds at the meetings are as large and the contribution as generous as in the C.P.
 I have still not been able to observe the four-hour rule. Nobody, however, is to blame for that. Such a rule can only be an ideal. In any case, God will ordain everything as He wills. I learnt as long ago as my young days to live according to Mira’s bhajan :
 Hari has tied me with a slender thread, I let Him pull as He wills.
I, therefore, don’t experience any difficulty. He who enables us
to sit and to walk may also put us to sleep.
 I should like you or Ghanshyamdas to see the members of the Delhi Municipality about the quarters of Harijans in Delhi . They must be improved.

 December 19, 1933
 CHI. BHAGWANJI,
 I am late in replying to your letter, though I had intended to reply quite soon. What you have suggested is right. But carry out your idea tactfully and without using compulsion. Very few non-Harijans will join. For them the rule will be compulsory. For the Harijans, the problem will be one of education. You cannot use compulsion on them. They will gradually learn to use lavatories. In the locality where Ramji lives, we may certainly construct lavatories if it is possible to introduce them there. Parikshital, Jethabhai and you may discuss the matter and do what you think best.
 Do not give up your interest in the Vadaj school. The number of children attending it should increase. Don’t leave even the grown ups. This will of course require patience on your part. Give up desire for the success of your work. Write to me from time to time.

  REPLY TO CIVIC ADDRESS, MADRAS 
 December 20, 1933
 MR. MAYOR, COUNCILLORS AND FRIENDS,
 I deeply appreciate the honour you have done me this morning by presenting me for the second time with an address.libtech_527_footnotelibtech_528_footnoteIt is always a matter of great pleasure to me to visit the South because, as you know, I have relations with the South of a very long stand-ing. I came in closest touch with the indentured Indian people in Natal as early as 1893 and some of you may recollect that my first contact in Natal was not only with the South Indians but with the Tamil Indians, and the very first case of distress that I had the good fortune to handle was one in connection with a Tamil.libtech_529_footnotelibtech_530_footnoteEver since that the South has bound me with ties not to be surpassed by any other part of India.
 You, Sir, may not know, but some of the Councillors and some of the other citizens will perhaps recall the fact that when I first had the honour of receiving an address at the hands of this great Corporation, among the several names that I registered for myself was that of an expert scavenger. It was at that time that I referred to the condition of your public streets and how those streets were used for insanitary purposes, even by men who should know better. I expect that there has been a vast improvement in that direction. But today my mission of scavenging is of a special character, a deeper character and, as I found it, of a purely religious character, taking religion in its broadest sense, not in the narrow sectional sense in which we, at the present day, unfortunately use the term.
 The reform I am aiming at today concerns a body of scaven- gers belonging to the Hindu society and does not make it none the less religious in the broadest sense of the term. I feel that it is a deeply humanitarian mission to which I  have not hesitated to  invite the co-

 operatioon of non-Hindus within, necessarily, the limits that I had the pleasure of mentioning before a body of mis- sionaries, I believe in Jubalpore.libtech_531_footnoteAs days advance, you will under-stand what this scaven- ging mission stands for. It stands for abolishing the distinctions of high and low which untouchability undoubtedly means; but you will not expect that, on my entering the Tamil land, I should give an elaborate view of what I consider is the duty of the Hindu humanity towards useful servants of society. That I must reserve for another occasion.
 Be it enough for the present, Mr. Mayor and Councillors, for me to thank you once more for the address that you have been good enough to present to me. I hope that I will carry with me throughout my tour your sincere prayers in the mission that I have undertaken.

  SPEECH AT ALL INDIA SWADESHI EXHIBITION libtech_532_footnote 
 MADRAS
      MR. 	PRESIDENT AND FRIENDS,  December 	20, 1933 
  	I have started out in Madras under happy and good auspices. I had 	the honour of receiving an address from the Corporation and now I 	have the honour of receiving another address from the Southern 	Indian Chamber of Commerce at the hands of my friend Mr. Jamal 	Sahib.libtech_533_footnotelibtech_534_footnoteI have the pleasantest recollection of the long 	conversations with him in London not more than 18 months ago or 	something like that. We dicussed then things of interest common to 	the whole of India and now I find myself again in his company. With 	your bless- ings, friends, I look forward to the success of my 	mission in Madras and later on in the whole of Tamil Nadu.  	You have, Sir, asked me to declare the Swadeshi Exhibition open. All 	of you may not be aware that I am a man who thinks and chooses 	things. I regard myself somewhat as an expert in matters of 	swadeshi. I have been instrumental also in organizing more than one 	exhibition of this kind in India. You cannot have everything that 	grows or is manufactured in India exhibited. You will naturally have      
 to make a definite choice in things if you  are to make an exhibition of this character of educative value for the public. For instance, you would not exhibit any seeds that grow in India like grass. You have to pick and choose those seeds and grains which you want to introduce to the public. I have given, friends, only an illustration out of many that crowd my memory now. I have spoken about this in order to introduce to you a very delicate thing.
 I do not accept invitations to open all and every swadeshi exhibition. I want to know whether the delicate wines produced in India are exhibited also. If they are, naturally, the fanatical prohibi- tionist that I am, I will say to you: “Thank you, but I can-not open this exhibition, where wines, which are harmful to the moral and economic well being of the country, sparkling though they may be, are exhibited”. Not equally on the same lines, but somewhat on those lines, I object also to open exhibitions where mill cloths, may be hundred percent swadeshi, are exhibited. I do not say it is injurious in the same sense that wines are. But if I am expected to open an exhibition of manufactured mill-cloths—and not things made in cottages in India—you will make a very poor show. I do not want to pit myself against mill-cloth. What I want to say is this. If you go into the history of the mill industry in India, you will discover it does not need a swadeshi exhibition for its distribution. The mills themselves are their own swadeshi exhibition. They have got all the facilities of their own. But what of khadi ?
 I do not want to say I have opened a swadeshi exhibition where all sorts of things are exhibited. It must be an exhibition, not only for your edification but of instruction to those to whom it should be useful. I have opened exhibitions in other places and I have been asked to open in a very big city like this a swadeshi exhibition. I had therefore to introduce this word of caution. Now, do you or do you not think of the various needs of the Harijans ? As you know, I am under a self-imposed vow, during seven or eight months that remain for me, to do some kind of propaganda work for Harijans. I have restricted myself predominantly to do Harijan work and no other work. I can talk to many people on varied subjects and there is no end to the varied subjects that do or can interest me. At the  present  moment, I propose to confine myself to the few things that are necessary for the Harijan cause.
 What can a swadeshi exhibition do for Harijans, you may ask.  I think khadi has got a great deal to do with it, because  the introduction of hand-spinning and hand-weaving of cloth, you will be surprised to know, has brought a ray of comfort and light into the dark homes of thousands of Harijans. I had the good fortune to go to
 many Harijan homes even during this brief tour and discovered the potency of khadi for Harijans. You will also be surprised to know that there are many things—I hope those things are exhibited here—at which Harijans have worked for the most part, if not entirely. There is the leather industry. The leather industry will be nowhere in India but for the initial work which the Harijans put into it. You will not expect me to take you into the history of it; my friend, Jamal Sahib, will give you chapter and verse about it. But I can tell the history in terms of rupees, annas and pies. Not less than nine crore rupees worth of hides go out of India which, if we are to deal honourably by Harijans, will all be absorbed in India, or at least not leave the shores in the raw state in which the hides are now sent. I can multiply instances. But I do not want to detain you or detain myself.
 I have great pleasure in declaring the Exhibition open and I hope you will take advantage of this Exhibition, make it of educative effect, interest yourself in these things that have been brought to the stalls and trace the history of their manufacture and then you will be surprised at the resources the poorest country in the world has at its disposal if we would only work at them intelligently and also work in co-operation with the downtrodden millions in India. If you would get off their backs and treat the Harijans, the Mahars and the other oppressed and depressed classes as our own comrades entitled to the same privileges and the same honour that we claim for ourselves, then in spite of the tremendous handicaps under which we are working this land of ours can become a land of plenty, a land of prosperity and not of downright pauperism in which the country now is.
 I thank you for inviting me to open this Exhibition and I hope the public will generously patronize it.

         SISTERS,   SPEECH AT WOMEN’S MEETING, MADRAS   December 	20, 1933 
  	It gives me great pleasure to be able to  renew  your acquaintance. 	This is not the first time that I am addressing a meeting of ladies 	in Madras. I have before me an extremely heavy programme to be gone 	through inside of forty minutes. Therefore you will excuse me for 	being very brief.  	I have come here to ask you to do one thing. Forget altogether that 	some are high and some are low. Forget altogether that some are 	touchables and some are untouchables. I know that you all believe in 
 God as I do, and God cannot be so cruel and unjust as to make distinctions of high and low between man and man and woman and woman. This untouchability is the greatest blot on Hinduism. And I have not hesitated to say that, if untouchability lives, Hinduism dies. If only to use man’s language, God has been patient with us but I have no hesitation in saying that even God’s patience can be exhausted, and He will no longer be patient with this atrocity that man is doing towards man in Hindu India.
 Gandhiji made a break in his speech at this juncture and said :
You have not given me the purse.
 Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddi immediately handed to Gandhiji the purse, saying that it contained cash to the extent of Rs. 430.
 You have given me a lean purse. But lean or fat the purse is meant to serve Harijans.
 Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddi said that many of them had contributed liberally to the purse that was going to be presented to Gandhiji at the public meeting at Tilak Ghat.
That is the excuse you want to give; all right, I see you are all
for equality with men.
 I regard this purse as token on the part of the donors of their desire to do some slight reparation to those whom we have injured in the name of religion.
 Well, anyway, ladies have parted willingly with their jewellery, some with their rings, others with their bangles and necklaces  and  so on and I invite you to do likewise, but on this understanding, that the jewellery you may part with is not to be replaced and that you should consider the giving as a privilege in connection  with  the Harijan movement. I conclude with a prayer to God Almighty that He may bless this effort and that He may so change your hearts that you will forget the distinctions between touchables and untouchables.
 There is one thing which a sister wants me to say and which I gladly do, namely, to put in a word on behalf of Hindi. I expect that some of you would like to serve in other parts  of India,  in  the northern parts of India. You cannot mix with the masses in the North unless you understand Hindi. Know that 22 crores of the people of India know and understand Hindi. Enlightened sisters of the South cannot neglect the language of the 22 crores.
 Well, I have finished, and those who want to part with their jewellery can do so.

  SPEECH AT STUDENTS’ MEETING, MADRAS 
 December 20, 1933
 STUDENTS AND FRIENDS,
 You are not new to me nor am I new to you. I remember you well. In 1896 when, of course, many of you were not even born, I made the acquaintance of the students of Madras, when I was an unknown man to you or for that matter to anybody else except those who are called the ‘coolies’, that is to say, the people of Tamil Nadu. I was even at that time known somewhat amongst them, but I remember what a welcome you gave me at that time. I thank you for the purse that you have given me as also for the address you have presented to me. I do not need to argue with you, and to convince you that untouchability is the greatest blot on Hinduism. I do not need to convince you that after all the education you have received, if you believe in the distinction between man and man, all your education is worthless; but I do want you to realize, if you are convinced, as you state in your address you are convinced, that untouchability is an evil, which we should get rid of. I want you to serve the cause; I want you to serve the Harijans. I had expected you to say in your address in what way you had served them. When I received an address from the students of Delhi, they told me in what way they were serving the Harijans of Delhi, and even the Harijans outside Delhi in the villages. I hope you will follow their example. They did not pretend that they had done wonders. They made some time ago an humble beginning. I wonder if you also had made an humble beginning—I wonder if you know how much you can do in order to ameliorate the conditions of Harijans and how much you can do by silent service to rid ourselves, our society, of this blot. The way to convince the society that untou- chability cannot be a part of religion and that it is a hideous error is for you to develop character. You will show it in your own lives that to believe in some people being touchable and some untouchable is not only not religion, but it is the reverse of religion. Whereas, if you had no character to achieve or lose, naturally people are not going to put any faith whatsoever in you. You have got to move the masses. You have got to change the hearts of the masses. Never mind what the orthodox people who claim to have studied the scriptures may have to say; they do not represent the masses nor do they represent the real interpretation of the scriptures as I hold it. It may be that I am in error, but in any case there are a few people who react upon the masses, as you can also react upon the masses. I promise you that in the end only those who are working among the masses will be the
 deciding factor. Masses will not argue. They will simply want to know who are the men who go to them and tell them that untouchability in which they have believed for such a long time is an evil,and if they find that those who have approached them, and told them that untouchability is an evil have credentials, they will listen to them, and if they have no credentials they will not listen. This is an incredibly simple proposition that I have been putting before you which each one of you can test for yourself.
 How can you serve these men, who are living in your midst? I have shown a way for the many students that I have addressed. Take a broom and a bucket in your hands, not by way of tamasha, not by way of a spectacle, but sincerely, and work with the broom and the bucket and clean out all those dirty places of Madras. Go in their midst and wean them from drink, teach them the elementary prin- ciples of hygiene and sanitation, to which most of them are utter strangers, be it said to our disgrace. Having considered that they were beneath our attention, that they were the lowest people on earth, untouchable, unseeable and unapproa-chable and so on, we had come to the conclusion that we need not attend to them nor take care of what they were doing. They took us at our word and thought they were not human beings, and that they were hardly animals, and so they neglected themselves. They simply eked out a miserable existence. It is in the midst of these people that you have got to go, and bring to them a ray of light. I hope that you will go to these places, and bend your backs and work in their midst, and assure them that you are there not with any mental reservations, nor with any base motives,but with pure motives and serving them with the motive of taking the message of peace and love in their midst. If you will do that you will imme-diately find that their lives are transformed as also yours. I do not ask you to steal a single moment from the hours that you may need for your studies, but I ask you to utilize your idle moments, and I have no doubt that if each of you will examine yourself, you will find that every day you have so  many  idle  moments. I do not ask you to give all your moments, but if you will combine and will serve the Harijans in Madras, you will find a revolution in their lives as also in your own lives. May God enable you to understand this! May God give you the strength to follow this message.
 One thing more I have to tell you. I have lodged a complaint against the students of Madras, namely, that, although they claim to be part of India, and not particularly Madras, how can they neglect, especially I say to my sisters, the language that over 22 crores of
 
 Indians understand, namely, Hindi ? You have got in Madras the  Hindi Prachar Sabha giving you all the facilities to learn Hindi. I know that many students have taken advantage of the facilities, but I am sorry to tell you that that is not enough. I had expected that your address this time would be presented written in Hindi, and I had also expected that you would call upon me to speak in Hindi. But I had to give it up at once. I am now engaged in one mission and one mission alone and therefore without taking much of your time and my time on a discourse on Hindi, I began with the burden of my subject. I close with this warning that when you begin to take upon  your shoulders the burden of the country, you will find what a great handicap you are labouring under if you do not know Hindi or Hin- dustani. I thank you once more.
 In conclusion, Mahatmaji said that he hoped that the students would relieve him of the burden of the address. He would auction the same. As no bidders were forthcoming, Mahatmaji said that ladies could also bid giving their jewels. He was willing to give away the address for a pair of bangles or a ring. Thereupon two ladies in the gathering sent up one bangle each. Miss Swaminathan gave away a pair and took away the address.

  SPEECH AT WOMEN’S MEETING, MADRASlibtech_535_footnote 
 December 20, 1933
 DEAR SISTERS,
 The Reception Committee of the Harijan Sevak Sangh has left very few minutes for me; hence eager though I am to make your acquaintance more fully than I can during the few minutes, I must restrain myself and run away from you after saying a few words. It gives me great joy to know that many of you are Harijans sisters. If any demonstration was needed, this very meeting is an ocular demons- tration; but for the knowledge that some of you are Harijan sisters I at least should not know which are Harijans and which are not. It shows that untouchability cannot be God appoin-ted institution. It is an institution appointed by man at his worst. And it is for savarna Hindu men and women to rise in revolt against that institution and blot it out. It, therefore, gives me pleasure to receive for the Harijan cause this
 
 little purse from the Mother’s Assocation.
 But I want to  say  one  word  now  to  the  Harijan  sisters.  I  want them and I want the  menfolk  among  Harijans  to  play  their part nobly in this movement of self-purification. There are three or four things which undoubtedly demand attention. One thing is the observance of the elementary laws of sanitation, purification of the body. Those laws you should conform to. Then there is the question of carrion-eating and beef-eating and I know some Harijans take to these evil habits. These two things must be given up. The fourth thing is not special to Harijans because many so called high class indulge in the bad habit that I am about to mention. And that is the drink evil. No matter what the so called high class Hindus may or may not do, you, at least, should tell the menfolk; and if you are also given to that habit then you yourself give up that habit altogether. Having worked for the last 50 years amongst the poor people and amongst those who are given to drink, I know what I am talking about. I saw in Natal, in South Africa, our own sisters dead drunk and wallowing in the gutters. When they were dead drunk, they did not know the  distinction  between good and bad. You will, therefore, save yourselves from it if you are addicted to that habit. May God give us all, Harijans or not, the strength to follow the message that I am endeavouring to give throughout the length and breadth of India.

  SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, MADRAS libtech_536_footnote 
 December 20, 1933 This is a wonderful demonstration that you have made of your affection. I hope that every one of you realizes the seriousness and
magnitude of the mission that I am trying to carry out in the name of
 God, for His sake and for His forsaken children whom we have come to understand as ‘Harijans’. There can be, in God’s eyes, no distinc- tion between man and man even as there is no distinction between animal and animal. Had God designed one part of humanity to be lower than the other. He would have put some distinguishing mark upon parts of our bodies whereby these distinctions could have been unmistakbly seen, felt and demonstrated.
Go where you will from end of India to the other, you will fail,
 
 
 as I have failed, to notice any such distinguishing feature in conn- ection with those who call themselves high caste Hindus and those whom high-caste Hindus describe as ‘untouchables’, ‘invisibles’ and what not.
 I therefore ask you seriously to consider this urgent question. I have said, and I repeat what I have said from a thousand platforms before this vast audience, that if we do not remove root and branch untouchability from our hearts, we are a doomed race, and Hinduism like many other ‘isms’, will perish and the discredit will be ours.
 In the midst  of  this  din  and  noise,  I  must  not  put  before you the implications of this great movement. Suffice it to say that when  untouchability is  removed from  our   hearts   Harijans   will feel the glow of freedom, and then we would treat them as we do our- selves, we would know that they have the same rights absolutely and without exception as we have, and that ‘Harijans’ would be subject to the same discipline that savarna Hindus are. If by God’s grace this message reaches your hearts,we shall forget all distinctions of high and low.
 Now I would like you kindly to disperse quietly so that I too can go safely to my car. You must kindly go back to your homes. The proceedings are finished.

 December 21, 1933
 Little children, boys and girls, only one word. Remember that little children also have to play their part in this movement of purification. And the only thing that I want to say is : ‘Children, be always good and always remember God in all troubles.’

  SPEECH AT ROBINSON PARK, MADRAS 
 December 21, 1933
 I thank you sincerely for the addresses that you have given me. I  thank  you   equally  for   the   purse  and   the   gifts   that   you have
 
 presented to me. All these moneys will be used for the uplift of Harijans. For this great movement of self-purification, I want men and women to take their full share. Let us shed all our vices and bad habits. Let us pray to God that He may give us pure minds. If any one of you is addicted to carrion-eating, give up that bad habit. Observe the rules of hygiene and sanitation. Educate your children, and give up the drink habit, if you are in the habit of drinking. It is one of the greatest enemies of the human race. That many savarna Hindu drink spirituous liquors is no reason for Harijans to drink it. It is drink that makes men mad and makes them forget the distinction between wife, mother and sister. May God give strength to you to go through the process of purification. Now, you will excuse me for not giving up more of my time. I have still a big programme to carry through. Finally, I ask you to give me free passage without any noise. I thank you for this magnificent demonstration of your affection and interest that you take in this movement of purification. May God bless you.

  SPEECH AT LABOURERS’ MEETING, PERAMBURlibtech_538_footnote 
 December 21, 1933
 FELLOW LABOURERS,
I thank you for the address you have given me.
 If you will make common cause with labour all over India, you ought to be able to understand Hindustani. Unless you do that there is no junction between the North and the South. But that is not the burden of my mission tonight. Tonight I want to tell labour that labour at least should have no distinctions of high and low.
 Having lived in the midst of labour for the last forty years, I know to my great sorrow that among labourers also there are distinctions. There are Harijan labourers and non-Harijan labourers. Even among non-Harijan labourers there are distinctions. You must forget these distinctions. Harijan labour and non-Harijan labour are all absolutely one. I say to those of you who claim to be Hindus that there is no warrant in religion for untouchability as we observe it today.
 It is impossible that God who is the God of  justice  could possibly make those distinctions that man observes today in the name
 
 of religion. Lastly, those who are given to carrion-eating or beef-eat- ing should give these up and if labour is to come to its own, you must give up the wretched habits of drink and gambling. I know that these two vices have degraded labour and desolated many homes among labourers. I therefore hope that you will give up the evil habits of drink and gambling. May God give you the strength to shed the evil of untouchability, drink and gambling.

  NOTES 
 GARLANDS
 It is devoutly to be wished that organizers will wean people from presenting me with garlands of flowers. If garlands must be presented, they should be of charkha-spun, even, strong and fine yarn, which can be used without difficulty for weaving purposes. Garlands are not produced without money or, which is the same thing, labour. All the money and all the labour available is required for Harijan service. And, in any case, I cannot afford to have labour or money spent for my pleasure, vanity or glorification. The showering of flowers is an injurious custom. The hard stems of yellow flowers, when they are thrown from a distance are calculated to break eye-glasses and injure the eyes. My eyes have, more than once, narrowly escaped damage from these stems.
 Let the money thus saved be used for adding to the purses collected. Indeed, I notice that there is room for economy in most arrangements. Motor-cars are used too lavishly. Only those of the local persons whose presence is necessary should accompany me from place to place. Workers are trustees for the Harijan cause, and as such they are expected to guard the Harijan chest with greater care and vigilance than they would bestow upon their own.
 AUCTIONS AND JEWELLERY
 I have seen a paragraph in a newspaper adversely criticizing my appeal to the women for gifts of jewellery and my auctioning things received as donations. Indeed, I would like the thousands of sisters who attend my meetings to give me most, if not all, of the jewellery they wear. In this country of semi-starvation of millions and insuffi- cient nutrition of practically eighty percent of the people, the wearing of jewellery is an offence to the eye. A woman in India has rarely any
 cash which she can call her own. But the jewellery she wears does belong to her, though even that she will not, dare not, give away, without the consent of her lord and master. It ennobles her to part with, for a good cause, something she calls her own. Moreover, most of this jewellery has no pretension to art, some of it is positively ugly and a harbinger of dirt. Such are anklets, heavy necklaces, clasps worn not for adjusting the hair, but purely as a decoration for unkempt, unwashed and often evil-smelling hair, or row upon row of bangles from wrist to elbow. In my opinion, the wearing of expensive jewellery is a distinct loss to the country. It is so much capital locked up or, worse still, allowed to wear away. And in this movement of self- purification, the surrender of jewellery by women or men I hold to be a distinct benefit to society. Those who give do so gladly.  My invariable condition is that on no account should  the  jewellery donated be replaced. Indeed, women have blessed me for inducing them to part with things which had enslaved them. And in not a few cases men have thanked me for being an instrument for bringing simpli-city into their homes.
 Now a word about auctions. I have seen nothing wrong about them. They set up a healthy rivalry and are an innocent method of evoking the generous impulse in man or woman for a noble cause. I have resorted to the method now for years without ever noticing the slightest civil effect produced by these auctions. Why is it wrong to pay a price beyond its intrinsic value for an article which one prizes, even though it be as a memento, if it is not wrong to pay fabulous prices for worn-out manuscripts of authors reputed to be great ? Surely, the price of an article is what a man voluntarily pays for it. And let it be remembered that people who bid at my auctions do not pay fancy prices for pleasing me. I know they do not. I can recall occasions when I have not been able to induce bids, even though the audiences have been otherwise as enthusiastic or responsive as anywhere else.
 ABUSE OF FASTING
 Cases of abuse of fasting have recently come under my observation. One person wrote threatening to fast if I did not send my autograph, three if I did not visit their places during the tour and another if his village did not produce Rs. 5,000 for khadi, Harijan and kindred constructive activities. I have no doubt that all these are instances of abuse of fasting. Why should I give my autograph, or visit
 a place or workers find money under threat of a fast ? There should be a moral obligation on the one against whom a fast is taken. Fasts are legitimately taken in the interest of some public good or for doing service to those for whom they are taken. I am well aware that the dividing line between use and abuse is often too thin to be noticeable. The better test, therefore, perhaps is whether the person fasting has undergone the requisite discipline for taking fasts calculated to influence conduct other than his own. In the cases quoted, so far as I can see, there was utter absence of qualification or previous pre- paration. Moreover, legitimate fasts, even if repeated by many, should be capable of response. In the cases under consideration, if a thousand persons asked for my autograph, or a thousand workers in a thousand village desired my visit to their places or a worker required poor people to pay the money he wanted, it is clear that response might easily be a physical impossibility.

  SPEECH AT GEORGE TOWN MEETING, MADRAS 
 December 22, 1933
 FRIENDS,
 Up to now we have done no business. What has happened is, the precious few minutes that are at my disposal have been taken away in the reading of addresses. Therefore, before I get the right to speak to you, I must do some business. (Laughter) I must ask you now to dispossess me of all these trinkets that have been given to me and exchange them for pure gold. (Renewed laughter) Then, I cannot be guilty of stealing away this diamond ring; and I shall, therefore, have to offer it to you.
I shall now begin the business portion of the meeting.libtech_539_footnote
 Gandhiji then spoke a few words in Hindi, thanking both the donors and the successful bidders for the help they had thus rendered for the cause of the Harijans. This was a great punyakaryamlibtech_540_footnotelibtech_541_footnote, he said; and in such acts of service, they must feel a
 pride. He exhorted them to remove from their hearts notions of high and low because of birth. Untouchability, he reiterated, was a great sin; and whoever made a resolve to rid his heart of this impurity of treating a certain section of his brothers as untouchables was really a better man. Gandhiji then explained in a few words why he called    untouchables    Harijans.    He    had    learnt    in     Tamil    a    great saying—
 
 Dikkatravarukku deivametunai libtech_542_footnote, and this indeed was the justification for the name ‘Harijan’ as applied to this class of unfortunate people. It was not his own coining; it was an untouchable who persuaded him to use it. He then concluded with an appeal to
 their hearts to cleanse their religion by removing the blot of untouchability.
 This is a great yajna; and and I wish to God that He gives you wisdom to take your proper place therein.

  SPEECH AT JAIN MANDIR, MADRAS libtech_543_footnote 
 December 22, 1933
 Now I proceed to business. You people go to far-off lands exploiting people and amassing wealth. I am now going to exploit you.
 The audience greeted this statement with laughter and cheers. Putting up for auction an ivory casket, Gandhiji said :
What will you give for this ?
 The first bid for the casket which would be worth roughly Rs. 15, was Rs. 101 by Mr. Ramnath Goenka.
Get along, Rs. 101 is nothing for you, Gujaratis assembled here.
 Rs. 201 was the next bid.
 Shall I let it go . . . Once, . . . twice, . . . I will not yet say “thrice” .   .   .  . There is yet time.	A few hundred is nothing to
you.
 You know I have come on a mission of reform. It is the cause of Truth, as I see it, and I appeal to you to help in it. The purse you have presented me is a poor one compared to what you can afford.
 Proceeding, Gandhiji said that the work of Harijan uplift he was now engaged in was a sacred one. So far as he could understand the spirit of the Vedas, he saw nothing to warrant distinctions of high and low, touchable and untouchable. In the eyes of God, according to true  advaitalibtech_544_footnote, all men were equal. It was only  maya   that
 made them see such distinctions between man and man. They must no longer consider their fellow-men as untouchable or unseeable. Could any man say that his head or eye or ear was superior to his hand or feet or any other part of his body ? All were equally important. Similarly every section of society was important as any other and they must look on all men as equal. He saw nothing in this doctrine that was against the dictates of dharma. He had full confidence that the work he was carrying on was God’s
 
 work and that it was the path of Truth. He prayed to God to confer prosperity on them and he appealed to them to utilize their wealth in the service of Truth and their fellow- men.

The latter       
 became a static personality. Ever since he had known Mr. Pantulu he had one speciality about him and that was that Mr. Pantulu always believed in giving himself away to those who needed him or his help. Mr. Nageswara Rao Pantulu had told him that the bulk of the profits he made from ‘Amrutanjan’libtech_550_footnotewent to the relief of the distressed, to help those who were in need. Mr. Nageswara Rao Pantulu had absolutely  no other purpose. Mahatmaji prayed that Mr. Nageswara Rao Pantulu might continue to evolve from step to step till at last everybody could go to him and get comfort and help. They must all translate in their own lives all the noble qualities that they found in or imputed to Mr. Nageswara Rao Pantulu.

  SPEECH AT HINDI PRACHAR SABHA CONVOCATION libtech_551_footnote 
 MADRAS,
 December 22, 1933 After apologizing to the graduates and pracharakslibtech_552_footnotefor his inability, due to pressure of time, to hand over to them their respective degrees in person, he assured them of his congratulations and blessings. He had very little by way of advice to give them for what there was to say had already been said by Mr. Tripathi.libtech_553_footnotelibtech_554_footnoteBut one point
 he would like to emphaize—about the need for following that advice. Hindi prachar
 in South India, and as he had seen, more particularly in Andhradesha, had made steady progress; but he would not be satisfied unless Hindi was understood by everyone to such an extent that not one would desire him to speak in English. His appeal to them was to push on with their work with courage and determination. They had started well and he hoped they would carry it on. It was stated that Hindi presented some peculiar difficulties to people of these parts of India. Perhaps this was true to some extent. But he felt no Indian language would present any insurmountable difficulty to an Indian. There was an element of Sanskrit common to all Indian languages which, so far as he could see, should make it very easy for them to gain at least a working knowledge of any Indian language. They found no difficulty whatever in mastering a foreign language like English or even such difficult languages as Tamil. Why should Hindi, therefore, present any great difficulty to them ? It was the language of 22 out of the 35 crores of India’s population, and it was bound to be the common language of India.
 It was stated by some, Gandhiji said, that Muslims could not understand Hindi and they understood only Urdu. But he could see no difference between Hindi and Urdu as they obtained among common folk. In Islamic books and a section of Muslims, it was true that a large percentage of Persian and Arabic words were employed thus
 
 
 rendering Urdu difficult for Hindus to understand. Similarly, some Hindus also use a large percentage of Sanskrit words in their books and conversation, making them difficult for Muslims to comprehend. But when he talked of Hindu and Urdu being identical he was not referring to this kind of Hindi or Urdu. He referred to only the language in vogue among common folk in North India, which contained a good mixture of Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic words and still was understood by everyone, Hindu or Muslim. It was this language he wanted every one of them to learn to understand and speak. Unless they did this, he was afraid people from the South could not touch the heart of the masses in the North and vice versa.
 The Hindi Prachar Sabha, he said, had been working in Dakshin Bharat for over fifteen years and yet, he asked, what had people done to avail themselves of its services and, by learning the language, to promote Indian national unity ? Did they not find time and money to waste on the races, cinemas and amusements ? Could they not spare a part of these for the learning of Hindi ? He had heard the Sabha was in need of adequate accommodation and had been trying to acquire buildings of its own but could not for want of funds. If everyone came forward to learn the language paying a small sum for the Sabha’s services the necessary money could easily be found and the Sabha need not continue expecting help from Northern India. It was the duty of South India to make the Sabha self-dependent. He would therefore repeat his appeal that South Indians must one and all avail themselves of the Sabha’s services and help in this national work.libtech_555_footnote

  REPLY TO DEPRESSED CLASSES DEPUTATION libtech_556_footnote 
 MADRAS,
 December 22, 1933 Come in Rao Bahadur. Can I give you a chair ? Now, Rao Bahadur, I have got your letter. Shall we begin with it ? Or what shall
we do ? Just as you would regulate the proceedings.
 “Will you permit its reading ?” Mr. Srinivasan submitted. Gandhiji said :
Yes, you please.
 . . . Mr. Bashyam Iyengar threw out a hint that the letter consisted of six typed pages.
It all depends on Mr. Srinivasan, who is the Chairman here. But
so far as I am concerned, I have read it from top to bottom.
 
 Mr. Srinivasan suggested that it might be allowed to be read for the benefit of his colleagues as there was hardly time to circulate it to them. Gandhiji asked Mr. Pushparaj to go ahead.
You will excuse me, If I am not attending to it. Because, I have
 almost got it by heart. In the mean time, I shall be putting my papers in order.libtech_557_footnote
 The best thing would be for me to take up point after point and deal with it. What you say about the Poona Pact is common ground between us; and I entirely endorse the view that if savarna Hindus do not work the Pact in the manner it is intended it should be, it can become nugatory and of no benefit whatsoever.libtech_558_footnoteI will admit that in its entirety.
 How far the Central Board at Delhi or the Provincial Boards will  be  able  directly  to  affect  the  elections,  I  do  not  know.  I think it is a very difficult and delicate subject. Therefore what I have directed is that with these elections generally we should not interfere. But we do interfere where injustice is done to a Harijan candidate. When that happens, as it did in Bombay, we try to set it right.
 Gandhiji related the Bombay incident at some length and mentioned his efforts in effecting the withdrawal of the candidate (for election to the Legislative Council) who had ranged himself against one who was a member of the Servants of India Society, uniformly known to be decisively friendly to Harijan interests.
 In Delhi there was the danger of the Harijan candidate not being elected to the Municipality. We intervened and room was specially made for the Harijan candidate. In Cawnpore, there was a Harijan candidate and it was wrong for savarna Hindus to have opposed him.  I came to know about it after the election. The gentleman who was defeated wrote to me; and I replied that it was wrong on the part of the savarna rival to have so ranged himself against the Harijan candidate. We tried our best to get this gentleman resign his seat. At that time it was not successful. What has since happened I do not know. There are other instances, as well.
 I give these instances to show that where there is a Harijan candidate, whose bonafides is not impeached in any manner whatsoever, the Central Board have tried to influence the savarna Hindu candidates to withdraw from the contest. But where Harijan candidates are opposed to one another, or when savarna Hindus are
 
 
 conducting the elections, the Board does not interfere—which you really want the Board to do. You desire that the Board should so regulate the elections or so influence the elections, as to have the right type of men elected. But, I think, the Board will then lose its influence. Today the Board is daily rising in influence, because of its absolute neutrality except where, as I said, a Harijan stands to suffer. That is the line of demarcation we have placed. If you examine the situation, I have no doubt you will agree with me.
 If you want to make this Board an effective instrument of service, it must keep itself apart and aloof from politics, and when the level of our character rises and the root that lies at the heart of untouchability is affected and expelled, there would be levelling up of everything all along the line. That is my hope. But with these lapses of mere moral character, the Central Board should not interfere. Once we endeavour to do that, I think, you would find that the whole of the structure will fall to pieces.
 The Board is absolutely unaffected by politics; and, as I have so often said, the Harijan movement is purely religious. If I succeed in doing so, and If the Board accepts that policy in all sincerity and works it out earnestly, you will find nothing better for our purpose. The movement will become purer, and the Board would be wiser and achieve its ends quicker for its aloofness and abstention from direct intervention in politics.
 Passing on to the next point raised in Mr. Srinivasan’s letter, namely, economic condition of Depressed Classes and the removal of untouchability, in general, through the instrumentality of the Government, Mahatma Gandhi said that he totally agreed with them—that the Board should not do a single act which would interfere with the encouragement afforded by the Government; and the Board, he assured, would not do it, no matter what views he held in connection with the Government.
There is no doubt I have been holding very strong views against
 the present system of government. It is a mischievious system, taking the interests of India as a whole. But I cannot possibly apply that doctrine in connection with Harijans, unless I would so throw myself in the turmoil and resist the Government, there also. I cannot do it.
 I say, honestly, I could not possibly resist doing it,  if  the Harijans were capable of looking after themselves, as you [Mr. Srini- vasan] are and as Mr. Pushparaj is. That is, so far as you individuals are concerned. Taken as a mass they are absolutely helpless. When they can help themselves, stand equal to savarna Hindus and brush
 shoulders with them, I shall be at ease and then say : ‘No; I cannot look to your interests.’ That I cannot possibly do.
 Let them take all the advantage they can from the Govern-ment and let them take all the advantage they can from the savarna Hindus. The two mixed together will enable them to redress the balance somewhat. Even then, I do not believe they would be able to redress the balance because this crushing down that has gone on for ages is not going to be lifted off entirely in a few years, no matter what atonement is done by savarna Hindus. It would take a long time before the Harijans come to their own and feel they are just as good as they might be.
 I can give you this absolute assurance that I shall never interfere with  the  policy  of  the  Government in   so   far   as   the   Harijans are concerned. Here also I will say I am conducting this tour in a manner so as to disarm all suspicion; and I will never take advantage of the Harijan movement in order to further the aims of the Civil Disobedience Movement. It would then not be civil but criminal. I do not ask your word of certicate. But I do say that I have never had any criminal intention in all my life. In order to justify that civil nature, I am keeping this Harijan cause apart. If, on the other hand, I wanted to use it for a political purpose, I would not have hesitated to make an open declaration that ‘of course, I am going to use the Harijans for conducting the civil resistance movement’. No; emphatically no. On the contrary, those Harijans who are living with me, and  who, according to their declarations, owe their all to their association with me, pleaded with me to allow them to join the movement, when I was disbanding the Ashram. ‘Why do you keep us aloof ? Are we less patriotic and less capable of offering resistance ?” You dare not do it,’ I warned, ‘because’, I said, ‘you, as represen-tatives of Harijans, would be putting yourselves in the wrong.’
 The Servants of Untouchables Society is today under the control of men who cannot afford to offer civil resistance. Messrs A. V. Thakkar and G. D. Birla are the moving spirits there. Not only that; all Congressmen, who have got this civil resistance in them and wanted to do so, are also prohibited from taking office in the Central Board, Provincial Boards or any of their branches.
 There still remains one question as to the activities of the Society and its relationship with the Government. There again, I would say, ‘Do not put that weight on the Board’. If you do that, it would lose its
 universal influence. I want the Board to have a universal influence and its influence felt effectively everywhere. In matters you have men- tioned, the Board will never interfere with the Government. The government may even adopt measures that may be harmful. Then it will be for you to put your foot down. We should not do it. There again I endorse what you [Mr. Srinivasan] have said in your letter.
 In your politics also you say you must be allowed to develop along your own lines. I entirely grant it. There will be no interference on the part of the Board. So then, when the Government’s policy is questionable in connection with Harijans’ interests, it will be for you and for you alone to decide whether to resist it, even by constitutional and legitimate means. But so far as the Board is concerned, I will say, ‘We have drawn the line of demarcation and there we stand.’ If they do stand, I know the Board will command the respect of the Govern- ment also. So all along the line, they will be acting on the square—all right angles and no acute angle.
 Now, to education.libtech_559_footnoteOn this subject, I think the Central Board can present you with an absolutely good  record. Everywhere scholarships are being given freely. So many hundreds of Harijans are now in receipt of scholarships which they cannot get from the Government or any other agency. We never say to a single person : ‘Do not go to the Government.’ That is not a policy which is applicable to this Board. We encourage them to seek assistance from the Government departments. Where there was not enough, the Board supplemented it, We have done it in so many cases. That is our policy in connection with education.
 Then, ah! you say that repatriation is the result of my activities in South Africa.libtech_560_footnotelibtech_561_footnoteThat is a very unkind cut. (Laughter)   I say that history will give a different verdict.
 When I landed on the South African soil in the year 1893, repatriation was on the anvil. Do you know that a Bill was actually passed in the Natal Legislative whereby every Indian, who after finishing his indenture wanted to settle in Natal, was required—to do what ?
 
 MR. R. SRINIVASAN : Pay poll tax. GANDHIJI : How much ?
 MR. SRINIVASAN : £ 1 a head.
 No fear. They stipulated £ 25. I resisted it.  The  original intention was that after indenture had been finished, they must go back. That is to say, indenture should expire in India. I promoted petitions in the Natal Parliament. I did it through the mercantile community, as it was not possible for me to do it through indivi-dual Indians at that time. The provisions were altered in conse-quence; and that is a matter of record. Therefore you will see, historically, repatriation was taking place when I went to South Africa; and on my going there, it became impossible. You then express your fear that this untouchability movement may end as the movement in South Africa ended. I wish it ended like that. (Loud laughter) Repatriation is now voluntary and repatriates get money compensation. In 1893, it was involuntary and compulsory without any compensation whatsoever. If that was the crime I have committed—(Renewed laughter)—I plead guilty.
 Winding up this part of the discussion, Gandhiji said that the scheme of repatriation had proved a failure. He knew it was a failure because he was in correspondence with those who could speak with direct knowledge in South Africa. He was guiding Indians there to the extent he could; and warning them against coming to India where they would be outcastes even among outcastes. In these circumstances, he said, he had nothing to repent for, in regard to South Africa.
 Let me now come to the temple-entry question; and I will at once say that I accept your point.libtech_562_footnoteIf you say you do not want it at all, I agree. But it is due to the savarna Hindus to say, ‘Come to our temples. They are as much open to you as they are to us. It is entirely your choice whether you will enter or not’. I do not invite Harijans to take part in this agitation for temple-entry. But you can signify your approval, if you wanted, that this is also your right, but you may not exercise it. Or you may take a different attitude. That is entirely for you to consider. But so far as I am concerned, it is simply a one-sided thing. It is a matter of repentance for savarna Hindus and a change of heart. You are entitled to come to those places which you consider to be our sanctuaries. You have just as much right as any savarna Hindu. When that right is recognized, it is for you to exercise that right or not.
 About the drink evil, Gandhiji said that he was always circumspect and careful
 
 in offering advice to this community.libtech_563_footnoteHe was aware that it was prevalent among other communities. But only the Harijans, who were under the great handicap of having to fight uphill, could not afford it. They had got to be, like Caesar’s wife, above suspicion.
 The savarna Hindus may wallow in lakes of red water; but you must fly away from it. I do not, however, want to wound your susceptibilities. I tell you, gentlemen like you may take it amiss; but the large body of Harijans don’t. After all, you and I know that I have been working in their midst for years and years in order to wean them from drink. Therefore, I think you ought not to seek to restrict my freedom. You can certainly warn me; and I accept it—shall shape my language in such a manner that it does not offend any person whatsoever; and you may take it from me that I would not say a single word to offend anybody.
 Lastly to the name Harijan. You say that the Depressed Classes were not consulted. They consulted me. That is the point. (Laughter) I have visited all parts of India. ‘Why are we called Harijans?’ I am asked. Why should they not have a better name ? That is the generality of feeling. ‘For Heaven’s sake do not call us coolies,’ they pleaded. At one time this word had a particular significance. A whole race was called by that name. If it was not now used it does not mean there has come about a change of heart. The offence to the ear has been removed. That is what the new name has achieved. It is not, as I said, my coining. An untouchable pleaded with me not to be known by an expressioon of eternal reproach. ‘Depressed’ or ‘Suppressed’ reminded them of slavery, he very rightly said. ‘I have no name to suggest; will you suggest?’ I asked. Then the man  suggested ‘Harijan’. He quoted in support from Narasinh Mehta, the Gujarati poet who had used it in his works. I jumped at it. I knew also the Tamil saying Dikkatravarukku deivame tunai. Is not ‘Harijan’ a paraphrase of it ? They are God’s chosen, who are outcastes. That is what ‘Harijan’ signifies as applied to suppressed classes.
 The certificate you have given in the last paragraph of your letterlibtech_564_footnoteis too early for me. You all have listened to what I have had to
 
 say to the points raised. We shall all work together with the same end in view. I am sure God is with us; and therefore success is assured. I have no misgivings at all. I know untouchability is dying. To me the monster seems to be still taking a few breaths; but they are  last breaths. (Loud applause)
 MR. R. SRINIVASAN: I hope so.
Yes; we can honestly hope.

  INTERVIEW TO “MADRAS MAIL” 
 MADRAS,
 December 22, 1933 Asked about his statementlibtech_565_footnotethat he had given Pandit Jawaharlal a power of attorney to act for him as leader of the Congress. Party, Mr. Gandhi said that he had
 noted the Pandit’s reply and the implication that he was joking when he made the
 statement.
 That is not wholly true. There was and is a serious background to my statement. Having abandoned politics for the present, and decided to devote myself to the elimination of untouchability from Hinduism I cannot govern the Congress Party. When I am asked by individuals to give my views privately on some point at issue I may do so, but I am not in a position to define or discuss policies. This is Pandit Jawaharlal’s work. And I have no desire to interfere with his absolute discretion. Hence my remark about power of attorney.
 Will not the Pandit’s well-known communist leaning mean that Congress policy will be given a communist bias under his guidance ?
No. I do not think so. Jawaharlal is too honest a man for that. I
 do not think he will depart from the fundamental Congress policy without giving ample notice to his colleagues. I do not think that Jawaharlal’s own views are yet sufficiently crystallized to make any fundamental departure from Congress policy likely. He is a firm believer in socialism, but his ideas on how best the socialist principle can be applied to Indian conditions are still in the melting pot. His communist views need not, therefore, frighten anyone.
 Reminded that the masses cannot be expected to make fine distinctions between ideological discussions and frank exhortations to pursue certain courses,
 Mr.Gandhi admitted that there was always a danger of the crowd misunderstanding a speaker’s purpose but declared that it was not Jawaharlal’s intention to inflame crowds.
 Conversation then turned on communist opposition to large estates, which, apparently, Jawaharlal shares.
 I do not think that the land should be parcelled out. It would be a serious loss if the influence of the big hereditary landholder were wholly destroyed. I do think, however, that the actual cultivator should have a title in the soil, and a larger share of its produce. At present, in many places, he gets far too little. He should get a fair share and not a bare maintenance.
 Referring to agrarian movements in various parts of the country, Mr. Gandhi declared :
 Whatever the Government do, this tremendous awakening is not going to die out. It has come to stay. What has impressed me most is that it has been accompanied with so little violence, thus constituting an unconscious manifestation of the effectiveness of non-violence.
 Asked whether he had contemplated the danger of middlemen, in the shape of money-lenders or marketing agents, etc., acquiring a foothold between the land- owner and the cultivators as a result of recent land legislation, Mr. Gandhi replied :
 It would be a deplorable thing if the middlemen got hold of the land. We must safeguard the interests of the actual cutlivator, by which I mean the man who himself tills the land. He may employ many labourers to assist him, but so long as he works on the land himself he fulfils my definition of a cultivating occupant.
 My work for the Harijans is purely religious. It has no political motive behind it, and is essentially humanitarian. It is in no sense of the term a political movement.
 But you will not deny that the movement must have political consequences ?
 That is true. I do say that, though such political consequences will be by-products of the movement, they do not constitute its purpose. Any religious movement must have repercussions on other aspects of life, for religion in its broadest sense governs all depart- ments of life.
 Mr. Gandhi admitted that the movement was liable to  exploitation  for political purposes, and was aware of the assertions, voiced recently by Sir N. N. Sirkar, that its purpose was to consolidate Hinduism againt the other minorities, but he firmly and emphatically denied that he had any such object. In fact he declared that he differed from the Hindu Mahasabha in this regard.
 The Hindu Mahasabha’s activities are essentially communal, and are designed to further Hindu interests as distinguished from other.
 The Harijan movement has no communal bias. It aims at the internal reform of Hinduism, at ridding it of artificial distinctions of high and low. I am fighting for the same rights, without reservation, for the Harijans that caste Hindus have in matters religious, social and politi- cal. I am not aiming at increasing the numbers of Hindu voters as such. So far as one single person can, I am trying to keep this move- ment entirely free from politics.
 When the scribelibtech_566_footnotereferred to the view held by many members of the minority communities, Muslims, Christians, etc., that the political effect of the movement, and the political end sought by others, whatever Mr. Gandhi’s own purpose may be, is to secure the domination of a consolidated Hindu majority, overwhelming all minorities by its numbers, Mr. Gandhi repeated his resolve to keep the movement free from all taint of politics.
 I want to absorb Christians, Muslims and others, as one indivisible nation, having common interest, then minorities will not feel themselves to be minorities. If untouchability is abolished, the bar to closer intercourse between Hindus and the minorities will disappear, and with its disappearance will come a new unity of aim and interest, a new oneness. This Harijan movement is in no sense exclusive. It aims at removing untouchability in every shape and form.
 Reminded that Dr. Moonje recently declared that Hinduism included all, Muslims, Christians, Parsis, and the rest, Mr. Gandhi replied :
 The object of Dr. Moonje differs greatly from mine. They are haggling over seats in the Legislature. That movement is solely political, mine is non-political.
 To question whether he approved of the bullying methods of some of his lieutenants in the matter of temple-entry, Mr. Gandhi forcibly replied :
 If anybody in the Harijan movement tries to use force he is acting against my wishes. I try to keep the movement from descen- ding to low levels, but there are difficult elements in any move-ment. For myself, I refuse to open a temple unless satisfied that the wish that it should be opened to Harijans is general. Recently I refused to open  a temple because the trustees seemed to be sharply divided. Only where temple-entry is approved by an overwhelming majority of the actual worshippers and by the trustees of the temple, will I consent to open it.
 Asked for his views on the Temple-entry Bills now before the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Gandhi declared that the Bills were necessary to free the hands of
 
 
 trustees and worshippers who might be willing to open temples to Harijans but were prevented from doing so by judge-made laws.
 Unless we free Hinduism from these restraints it will become stagnant, and perish.
 Unless we can root out untouchability from Hinduism it must perish, it will deserve to die, and I will not regret its passing away. Un- touchability must go. What I say to Europeans is : ‘Come down and work with us as free citizens, rather than as members of the ruling classes.’
 Mr. Gandhi said that he was amazed at the warmth of the welcome that Madras had given him, at the size of the crowd on the Triplicane Beach on Wednesday evening.
 It took me 30 minutes to reach the platform, and 45 to return from it to my car again. There were over one lakh of people, and it did good to see how Harijans and caste people mixed together in the crowd. That would not have happened a few years ago. Untou- chability is going.libtech_567_footnote

  INTERVIEW TO “THE HINDU”libtech_568_footnote 
 MADRAS,
 December 22, 1933
 As usual I have experienced nothing but deep affection from the people wherever I have gone. But I must confess that I was un- prepared for the demonstration at the Beach and the demons-trations that I witnessed during the visits to several labour areas. The numbers that attended these demonstrations everywhere exceeded past records.
 Whilst there is no doubt that personal affection and attachment had to do a great deal with them, I am convinced that the vast mass of humanity that seemed to cling to me fully understood and appreciated what I stood for and what I had come for. If their religious sense had revolted against the drive against untouchability, the exhibition  of their affection, even if I could not have lost it altogether, would have been tempered with moderation and restraint, if not reasonable cool- ness. I am used to reading the mass mind by taking at a sweep the ex- pression in their eyes and their general demeanour. I could find no
 
 trace of disapproval of what I have been doing in connection with untouchability. The manner in which they came forward with their contributions when I asked for them was also significant and went to strengthen the impressions I have given. I am, therefore, filled with hope for the future.
 I feel that even in the South untouchability is shaken to its very roots. I would like to say to my sanatanist friends that I have no desire whatsoever to wound their susceptibilities. I want to find points of agreement; and I know there are many. The points of disagreement are few. If my approach to them cannot bring about immediate agreement, I know that time will, if I have patience which I feel I have.
 I would like to add one word as to the behaviour of the Police. Today was really a trying time for them, as I had to pass through the business parts of George Town; and it gives me pleasure to be able to say that their behaviour was friendly and helpful. They became as it were one of the people and handled them in a gentle manner. I am grateful to them for this exhibition of friendliness.

  MESSAGE TO TAMIL LOVERS’ CONFERENCE

 I hope that the love of Tamil lovers will prove lasting and stand the severest strain. The superficial knowledge that I have of Tamil has enabled me to appreciate the beauty and the richness of the language. To neglect it would appear to me to be criminal.

   SPEECH AT GUNTURlibtech_570_footnote     BROTHERS 	AND SISTERS,    December 	23, 1933 
  	Guntur is not new to me. I thank you for your address and the purse 	you have offered to me. The lawyers of Guntur have subscribed     
 a sum of Rs. 145. I myself was a lawyer once. I say I cannot accept such a small sum from the lawyers. They are not so poor. I under- stand from this that the Guntur lawyers have not interested themselves in the Harijan cause. This sum of Rs. 145 can be given by a single vakil. I ask them, ‘What are you going to do ?’ I know the lawyers of Guntur. That is why I am telling them so. Last time when I was here, they gave me a bag of money. All days are not alike. Then money was plentiful, now a little scarce.
 I have just visited Mr. Punna Rao’s Gurunatheswara temple at Tilakpet. Because of the name given to the deity, the temple has become unpopular as the deity was named after the paternal uncle of Mr. Punna Rao. In truth, there is nothing wrong in the name ‘Guru- natheswara’, though the name “Gurunath” may be wrong. In my opinion God should not be named so as to perpetuate the memory of  a human being. It is not proper that the name of the donor should go with the charity. This is my personal opinion. The name of the God should not really matter. Mr. Punna Rao, the late Gurnadham’s brother’s son, has told me that he has no objection to change the name of the deity. The deity will hereafter be called ‘Gouri Vish- weshwara’. I have signed the paper containing the new name.
 Mr. Punna Rao wants to throw open the temple to the Harijans. But I have asked him not to do it now and for this reason. Temple- entry and change of name at one and the same time is not desirable under the peculiar circumstances of the case. I am not against any temple being thrown open to the Harijans. But I am not for compulsion. When the bhaktas and the trustees are willing, the temple should be thrown open to the Harijans. Now that the deity’s name has been changed, the trustees and myself are anxious to see how many of you will visit the temple. Three months hence from today, i.e., on the 23rd of March next, this temple will be thrown open to Harijans. It cannot be done unless public opinion favours it. If public opinion favours it, the temple will be thrown open on the 23rd of March next, by which time I hope the issue will be settled. I hope you will attend this temple from now on and witness the entry into it by the Harijans on the 23rd of March next.
 If the savarnas do not do justice to the Harijans the Hindu religion will perish. No religion perishes owing to extraneous causes. It lies in nobody’s power to do it. But a religion will perish if those who follow it tread the path of adharma.

  SPEECH AT HARIJANS’ MEETING, THALLAPALEM 
 December 23, 1933
 It gives me much pleasure to be able to come here. But I must also tell you that it gives me much trouble. The car could not  negotiate its road to my satisfaction. Therefore, most of the way I had to walk. Walking itself is no trouble. But the fact is I had no time and yet I have to come here. The promise having been made, I have to fulfil that promise.
 By cutting the knot, I have performed the opening ceremony of the Harijan Ayurvedic Kuteeram. I hope it will be a proper institution for healing the ills of those surrounding this place. Though, through the kindness of the organizers of this function, the address has not been read to you, I have read it. The address is a report of your present activities and somewhat your hopes for the future. I do wish that your hopes for the future may be fulfilled, but as a worker of 50 years standing I want to utter a word of caution.
 You have a very ambitious programme  and  if  the  managers  or trustees of your programme are vigilant, painstaking, honest and men of unimpeachable character, it  is  just  possible  that  you  can work up  the  programme.  But  if  there  is  want  of vigilance,  want  of care, want of honesty, want of ability,  I  promise  that  not  even one item of your programme will be fulfilled. For my part, I will appeal to the Harijan Sevak Sangh to give you an equal contribution for the work you might do. Well, I can make this promise on behalf of the Harijan Sevak Sangh, viz., that if you will produce a workable scheme and men of character that will satisfy the Harijaan Sevak Sangh, and if you produce proper accounts which can be inspected from time to time by the Harijan Sevak Sangh, certainly the Harijan Sevak Sangh will be able to render you help, financially. Therefore, if you do not receive help from the Harijan Sevak Sangh you will have to blame yourself and not the Harijan Sevak Sangh. But you will be able to get help from the Harijan Sevak Sangh if you satisfy the conditions I have suggested. As far as I know from the  previous history of the Harijan Sevak Sangh it never went back from the promises it made.
 The Harijan Sevak Sangh has enough of money to satisfy your wants.
 To those who have assembled here I appeal to make use of all the institutions that may rise in your midst in every legitimate way possible. I want to hear of Harijan institutions coming into being here
 and everywhere. The object of the Harijan Sevak Sangh is not to displace your labours but to supplement them. The Harijan Sevak Sangh will have more than justified its existence if it will be able to serve Harijans properly. Therefore, you can easily under-stand that the reputation of the Harijan Sevak Sangh depends entirely upon your hands and your own approval.
 One thing more I would like to say and that is the same I have been repeating everywhere. That is this. In this movement of purification Harijans will have to play an honourable and valuable part. I repeat that you should all observe, if you have not already been observing, the laws of hygiene and sanitation. It does not mean that all savarna Hindus are living in sanitary conditions. As a Harijan by choice, I ask you to rise above these things and purify yourselves, unmindful of what savarna Hindus do or what they are. Similarly if there are any Harijans, who are eating carrion and beef, I invite them to give up these habits and, if they have never touched these things, I want them to become missionaries and do propaganda work against such habits. And then comes the drink curse. If you are, or any one of you, addicted to drink, give it up, for drink is a poison. You should not take that poison because many savarna Hindus also take poison. You do not want to sink with savarna Hindu but you want to swim with them, and if you have developed vigorous arms and can swim well, savarna Hindus will also rise; I know for certain that the time is coming in the near future when the Harijans will be able to help savarna Hindus out of the mire in which they are falling. Therefore I want every Harijan to work in robust faith.
 To savarna Hindus I want to say one word. If you do not forget all distinctions of high and low, rid yourselves and your hearts of untouchability altogether, you and I and the Hindu race will perish. I want you to believe this although thousands of persons may say anything to the contrary. What I say is out of rich experience.

          FRIENDS,   SPEECH AT PEDDAPURAM   December 	24, 1933 
  	Let me tender you my congratulations on the most admirable 	arrangements made in order to secure a straight passage for me to 	the meeting place. You can well imagine that I have very limited 	energy to work my way through pressing crowds. It was therefore most 	re- freshing for me to find here that I had not to push my way 	through crowds. I thank you for the several addresses and the purse 	just presented to me and I thank you also for the restraint with 	which you have refrained from desiring to read those addresses.  	You know the purpose of this tour. I want you to join me in driving 	out the curse of untouchability. I want you to join with me in 	whole-heartedly believing that untouchability as we practise it can 	have no religious sanction. The very thought that any single human 	being can be born untouchable is most debasing. We are too near our 	own times to notice how Hinduism is disintegrating under the load of 	this heavy curse and I must repeat here what I have said from a 	thousand platforms that if untouchability is not removed, Hinduism 	dies. It therefore gladdens my heart when I see such a large number 	of people gathering at this meeting and giving their coppers. But I 	must not detain you and detain myself discoursing on this problem of 	untouchability.  	I have a heavy programme in front of me for the day. I will 	therefore close by repeating my thanks to you for the admirable 	arrangements, the address and the purse, and by the prayer that God 	may give us sufficient strength to go through  this process of 	purification.  	I would like to give a few brief minutes to the sale of these frames 	containing the address and to the sisters here to discard their 	precious ornaments. If any of you have not contributed to the purse 	and desire to pay your share to this purse, you will kindly do so. 	But now these two frames have suffered a reverse. The glass is 	broken. Let this be a lesson for the future that no frames are 	presented to me. I know that Andhra is an artistic province of 	India. You must therefore discover the artistic and simple method of 	framing the addresses you present.  The 	Hindu, 25-12-1993 
  
  SPEECH AT GOLLAPALEM 
 December 24, 1933 I first learnt to beg pennies from indentured labourers in South Africa. Such collections have always  been  charged   with  refreshing
blessings. I cannot recall a single instance of a man or a woman who
 repented for having given to me. Causes for which I have begged were good. The Harijan cause for which I beg now is undoubtedly the best for which I have begged. I am now inviting savarna Hindus to a purificatory rite and to repentance. Whatever little a savarna Hindu does for Harijans, he does to uplift himself or herself and Hinduism.

 December 24, 1933 I am grateful to you for your addresses of welcomelibtech_572_footnoteand  the money you have given me. But what you paid does not satisfy me. I
 expect more. I am now disposing of the two addresses presented to me in auction.libtech_573_footnote
 I congratulate you on the excellent arrangements you  have made for holding this meeting. This place is richly endowed  by nature; and beautifying things is a special characteristic of nature. By God’s grace, you have not spoiled the beauty of  nature  but maintained it intact. All of you know that you have in your midst an ashram known as the Valmiki Ashram. I have just visited that Ashram, which gives shelter to Harijan boys, and I had the pleasure of hearing the bhajans and keertans sung by those boys. I was very much impressed by them. They have presented me with a beautiful address in which they ask for your support. The Ashram stands in need of your support—from all of you; it deserves all the support that the people of the taluk give it.
 Nature intended all human beings to be equals; but man in his arrogance has created invidious distinctions by classing some as high and some as low. God does not recognize these inequalities. You may
 
 Sambamurti. 
 see anywhere or anything in nature, but you cannot see this kind of inequality which man has created. So unless you eradicate the evil of untouchability, you cannot establish equality, which is nature’s law. I ask you all to join me in my prayer to Almighty to give you strength and courage to eradicate the curse of untouchability entirely. I do not want to detain you longer. If you succeed in collecting any more money among the ladies, you will please bring it to me.

great pleasure to be able to renew my acquaintance with Rajahmundry
 and its citizens. You have taught me to expect great things from you and I hope that you will in this Harijan cause, live up to the expectations that you have raised.
 I see here the address pesented by the Hindu Samaj. I have gone through its programme that was sent to me. It is an ambitious pro- gramme; but no programme whether ambitious or unambitious can possibly be fulfilled without the necessary change of heart amongst the millions of savarna Hindus. Untouchability is like a slow poison killing the Hindu body, and even as you cannot sustain a body that is slowly perishing, you will not be able to sustain this perishing Hinduism unless you remove the curse of untouchability.libtech_575_footnote
 I am too sorry to have to inform you that it will be impossible for me to go on with my speech unless I secure complete silence on your part. Now by the time you sit down, I propose to do a little bit of work and therefore I propose to put up this address by the  Municipality for auction.

  REPLY TO HARIJAN DE`PUTATIONlibtech_576_footnote 
 RAJAHMUNDRY,
 December 24, 1933
 One important question that you have raised is that the Harijan Sevak Sangh should be principally manned and managed by you. That shows that you have not followed the pages of the Harijan. That shows also that you have not understood the origin of the Board. The Board has been formed to enable savarna Hindus to do repentance and reparation to you. It is thus a Board of debtors and you are the creditors. You owe nothing to the debtors, and therefore, so far as this Board is concerned, the initiative has to come from the debtors. You have to certify whether the debtors discharge their obligation or not. What you have to do is to enable and help them to discharge their obligations; that is to say, you can tell them how they can discharge their obligation, you can tell them what in your opinion will satisfy the great body of Harijans. They may or may not accept your advice. If they do not, naturally they run the risk of incurring your displeasure. A debtor may go to a creditor and say to him, I have brought so much money, will you take it ?’ The creditor may say, ‘Off you go; I want full payment or none.’ Or the creditor may say, ‘What you have brought is not part payment, but worse.’ All these things you,  creditors, can do. And so, when this Board was established and some Harijan friends wrote to me, I told them that Harijans should form themselves into advisory boards or boards of inspection. I want you to understand this distinction thoroughly. You will please see that there is no desire not to accept your advice or co-operation or help. I am only putting before you the true and logical position. This is a period of grace that God has given to caste Hindus, and it is during this period of grace that they have to prove their sincerity. And I am moving heaven and earth and am going about from place to place, simply in order that this obligation on the part of savarna Hindus may be fully discharged.
 A member of the deputation then suggested that the Board should appoint advisory committees of Harijans of its own selection.
 Do not ask the Board to select a committee of Harijans, but select your own committee and say to the Board you have elected
 these members and it should carry on correspondence with them. There is another danger in the suggestion. There may be factions and divisions among you. Different committees may be appointed by different factions. The Board may recognize all of them. But that will be unfortunate. Let there be no quarrels among you. Present a united front to the debtors. The debtors may put you against one another, though the Board, if it is worth its name, will not do  that.  The Congress has been able to present a united front. Today, the Congress is full of simple men like you and me. You should have a body of business-like men who will put down with a strong hand all quarrels among you. Then you will dominate the Board without being on it. Do not be easily satisfied. Tell the debtors you are not going to be satisfied with 5 shillings in the pound but that you must have 20 shillings in the pound. This is not a matter for bargaining.

You should not mind if Dhiru feels unhappy at being separated from 	you. If his health remains good, he will in time become self- 	reliant in Bhavnagar. Dudhibehn’s company is bound to benefit him. 	Moreover, Kusum also is there. Let him, therefore, stay on there 	permanently. It will be enough if you continue to write to him 	regularly.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati : G. N. 5361   
         BA,   LETTER TO KASTURBA GANDHI   December 	25, 1933   You must have got the 	long letter which  I   wrote  to   you  last 
  	Monday. This Monday we are in Sitanagaram. It is situated on the 	banks of the Godavari. It is a small village, in Andhradesha, and 	has an ashram in it. Being a village, it is completely peaceful. We 	came here in a boat. The river is quite big and, therefore, small 	steamers can sail on it. We visited Madras and spent three days 	there. Sastri was of course there. I met Jethalal. Gangabhabhi lives 	in the city itself. I met Jethalal’s wife, too. Both are in good 	health. Jethalal gets a pay of Rs. 150 and is, therefore, quite 	happy. I met Urmiladevi’s son also. There was a large number of 	visitors. Lakshmi is quite well. Papa also is in Madras. Lakshmi 	stayed with me all the three days. She was happy in the company of 	Mirabehn, Kisan and Om. We shall be meeting once again, for my tour 	of that part is incomplete. My health is all right. I was again 	examined by two doctors. There is, therefore, no reason at all for 	you to worry about me. Have Dahibhen’s teeth improved? Do you get 	the Jam-e-Jamshed ? You asked for something like a 
 discourse. I think I must give you one today.
 The chapters of the Gita recited today were IX, X, XI and XII. In Chapter IX, the Lord says that those who worship Him attain to Him.libtech_578_footnotelibtech_579_footnoteIn Chapter XII,  He explains who should be called a  bhakta.libtech_580_footnoteThe beauty of the description is that it does not contain any quality which even the most ignorant person cannot cultivate. Any man or woman who strives unaided by another can become a bhakta and be one with the Lord. The qualities mentioned are these. The bhakta has ill will for nobody but is a friend of all and has compassion for all; he has no feeling of personal attachment towards anything or anybody, is devoid of ego, is equal-minded to happiness and unhappiness and is of a forgiving nature. He is ever contented, is self-controlled and keeps his vows; he has dedicated his mind and reason to God. He causes pain to none and has no fears and worries, desires nothing, is pure in mind and heart and skilful in work, has renounced everything and treats friend and enemy with equal regard, is indifferent to respect and disrespect, bears heat and cold, is unmoved by praise or censure, looks upon wherever he happens to be as his home, that is, has no home of his own, doesn’t speak unnecessarily and has a steady mind. Such a person [says the Lord] may be described as my bhakta. If all of you reflect over this deeply, you will realize that anybody who wants can become a bhakta without help from any other person.

  LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL 
 SITANAGARAM,
 December 25, 1933
 BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
 You waited for a letter from me and I waited for one from you.  I was under the impression that I had not received a reply to my letter. We are touring with such speed that I can’t remember dates or days. I don’t remember, even, to whom I have to write and what. That I am past sixty may also be one reason for this.
 Chandrashankar has unnecessarily alarmed you about [my rising] at three. If I did not get up at that hour, I would feel very uneasy. You should insist, rather, on my going to bed early. That rule is certainly not being observed just now. Still, all the doctors tell me that my health has remained very good so far. Nor do I write as many letters as you think I do. I write only such letters as I must. If you were with me, you also would press me to write some of them. I must admit that your complaint that I left you alone [in jail] is just. But the problem will be solved by and by, I am sure. Stop worrying about me completely. I don’t overstep the limits of my health. If you saw how I work, you would admit that I was taking very good care of it. Or truly speaking I should say that God has been preserving it. What would He do, however, if I opposed Him ? That He has been saving me from serious dangers is a sign that I have lost myself in Him. In Madras I was in danger every day of getting crushed, but I was saved. That was not man’s doing. It was God’s will. The rule about five hours has been observed mostly on paper only.
 I will certainly write to Ba every week. So far I have not let a single week pass. God will keep her firm. Who else can do that? There is no cause at all for worrying about Mani.
 I had sent a wire immediately to Kanjibhailibtech_581_footnote, and I had received a reply both by wire and letter. I have again replied by letter and said that he should not come thus far for my sake. If, however, he himself
 
 thought it necessary to come, he might certainly do so. I have even given him [convenient] dates. I forgot to mention all this in my letter to you. His letter was a fine one.
 I think it will be difficult to meet Raja, though Lakshmi saw me in Madras. She is running the sixth month and cannot,  therefore, move about freely. She keeps good health. Raja wants the delivery to take place under his care. Devdas also will go to Madras. Lakshmi was in good spirits. Raja will be released on 6th February.
 .    .    .    ’slibtech_582_footnotelibtech_583_footnotecondition   is  the   same   that   it   has   been.   He   is discontented with himself. He is  miserable because.	is again
 pregant. He cannot exercise self-control and afterwards he feels unhappy. I have tried my best to comfort him. But on the whole he is better where he is.
 Princess Aristarchi writes to me every week without fail. She sends money too. There is no limit to her kindness. She  is  now helping Trivedi’s Manu	libtech_584_footnoteI have written to the Princess and
 requested her to explain to him his duty. It is true that Manilal and Sorabjilibtech_585_footnoteare quarrelling with each other. Their quarrel is about  the policy to be followed there. I couldn’t advise either of them in this quarrel. But I have written to Manilal and told him that he should follow what seems right to him, without departing from civility. I have advised him not to make the quarrel a personal affair. I believe their differences will be resolved.
 Gordhanbhai continues to write about Vithalbhai’s donation. I have not read all that he has written. I will take a suitable opportunity to reply to him and then keep quiet. I had a very sweet letter from Subhas. I did send it to the Press. I am sure it must have been printed.
 The tour is going on very well. There is no heart-burning anywhere. So far I have not met people in the South bent on creating trouble. About the future, God alone knows. The crowds are as large as ever. We are in Sitanagaram today. There is perfect peace here. This is a small village. Today is my silence day. Tomorrow also I shall be here. If I had not got these two days at one place, it would have
 
 been difficult for me to go on with the tour.
 I   met   Sastrilibtech_586_footnotein   Madras   for   an   hour   or   so.   It   was  just   a friendly meeting. Munshilibtech_587_footnotelibtech_588_footnoteand  Lilavatilibtech_589_footnotecame  and  saw  me  there. Munshi seemed to be in good health. There was a wire from Bhula- bhai. He has not recovered completely.
Kaka and Surendra Mashruwala are in Gujarat.
 Kishorelal has still not recovered. Swami is in a place between Sanoli and Bombay. I suppose you hear about him.
 Have I told you that Kisan is in the party with me? She is a very good young woman. Being a friend of Prema, she couldn’t but be so.

  LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL JOSHI 
 December 25, 1933
 CHI. CHHAGANLAL,
 I started to write a long letter to you, and dictated a page of this size. That was in Jabalpur. Then I could not proceed further with that letter. And now I am writing this one. It is the night of silence day, in Sitanagaram. The silence is not yet over. I will break it at 9.30 p.m. It is 8.30 p.m. only. It is not incorrect to say that I can write only on Mondays and Tuesdays. I always get up at three in the morning and write what I can between then and prayer-time. I may, of course, be interrupted even during that period. When I am in a train, sometimes, I cannot even get up at three.
 I am having a wonderful experience during this tour.  The crowds are larger than they used to be in the past. But these numbers may easily deceive us, for we have to reach crores of people. Nor is it that all the people who come immediately change their way of living. The only consolation is the thought that this propaganda does not seem to displease all these hundreds of thousands. We can therefore hope that sooner or later the practice of untouchability will disappear completely.
 You should make your study of the Gita thorough in every respect. You should master both the grammatical construction and the literal meaning of the verses. I am sure you can recite the verses with correct pronunciation of the words. Again, the other reading may be limited in extent but it should be deep. A person who digests one book knows more than another who reads a thousand without digesting any of them. Do you have a spinning-wheel with you ? Wardha seems to have agreed with Vimu and Rama in every way. Rama’s hand may become completely all right. Dhiru seems to be happy in Bhavnagar, but we cannot still feel that the problem about him is solved. He is still weak, but his health is much better than it used to be. Dudhibehn does of course look after  him  carefully. Kusum also is there. Nanabhai, too, takes care of him. Balabhadra is very happy there.
 Appa Patwardhan has come here to see me. He will leave now. Kisan has joined me from Wardha. She is a friend of Prema and is a very good young woman. She has, however, become a little weak physically.
 Chandrashankar is carrying the burden of two journals quite well. This time Thakkar Bapa’s place is taken by Malkani. The work
 is going on well. Ramnarayan also is helping. Kishorelal has been ill and suffering a good deal. He has been getting fever and it does not leave him. Brijkrishna also was seriously ill. He is improving now. His life was actually in danger. But, then, is there anyone of whom that is not true ? However, people who are not so ill that they have to remain in bed do not think that their lives are in danger.
 Ba is having a holiday in Yeravda, so to say. Dahibehn’slibtech_590_footnoteteeth are giving her trouble. Shanta and Lalita are quite well. Dwarkanath seems to be managing the affair at Wardha fairly efficiently. And there is also Lakshmibehn who, as you know, has identified herself with the Ashram. Kaka and Surendra Mashruwala are in Gujarat.

  	I have not heard from you for some time. You should write to me 	regularly. For my part I may not be able to write to you sometimes 	in all this rushing about of the tour.  	Look after all the children. You should not forsake your duty 	towards Kusum because of anything that Jamna might say or write to 	you regarding her. Even if Kusum loves adornment I would not let her 	satisfy her desire. That is my weakness. As for you I cannot imagine 	that you could love adornment. Ask the children to write to me.

MATHURADAS,  	I have received your letters. But where do I have the leisure to 	write replies? Today being a silence day, I am scribbling as many 	letters as possible.  	You should take money from the Harijan Fund account with Jamnalalji 	to meet the cost of the tin sheets sent to Nasik and to make    
 up the deficit Gosibehn has in the Harijan budget, then let me know how much money is still left. I think it is only proper that Gosibehn is paid every month. I shall continue my efforts to raise money from Bombay.
 In what form a reply should be given about Vithalbhai is a real problem. I shall think over it.
 I have not seen Munshi’s statement. He has talked to you. He has also told you many other things about himself. I have told him to do what he thinks proper. I also said that I had no intention at the moment of guiding anybody.
 The newspapers say that Jivraj has taken charge. If the reports are correct, congratulate him. I was a little worried. Surely he is taking some rest? What does he have to do?
 I have not been able to write to Gokhale, Bapa and others. I hope to write to them tomorrow.
 I had known about the Orissa Committee at Ahmedabad. It will be good if some money is collected.
 Do take rest and get rid of your pain. Taramati must be doing well.
Brijkrishna seems to have fully recovered. There was a  telegram.

Also 	G.N. 11407     SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, ELLORE   December 	27, 1933  	I wish to thank you all for this great reception which is an 	exhibition of your great affection. I thank you for the various 	purses and addresses including one from the Municipality and another 	from the District Board. You will not expect me to refer to the 	details of the various addresses in the too short time before me.  	My first and sacred duty is to unveil the portrait of the “Lion of 	the Punjab”, the late Lala Lajpat Rai. You will not expect me to 	recount before you his many valuable qualities and services. I had 	the privilege of enjoying his confidence till he died. He was the 	President of the historic session of the Congress in 1920. Today to 	me and to you the one outstanding quality of his is his 	unadulterated love for the untouchables. He has taught Hindu India 	to keep to its sense of duty to the so-called untouchables, the 	Harijans. Lajpat Rai always 
 proclaimed that untouch-ability was the greatest blot on Hinduism. If he had done nothing else, we, Hindus, should revere his  sacred  memory for his war against untouchability. Who can deny his services to the country, his bravery and his fearlessness ? It was not by an idle epithet that he was called the “Lion of the Punjab”.
 I must pass on to other things. You will be pleased to know that Mulpuri Chukkamma even from Vellore Jail thought of Harijans and out of her poor belongings she sent me this ring. Her letter bearing the signature of the Superintendent of the Central Jail is here with me. Who can help deriving inspiration from such acts ?libtech_598_footnote
 Wherever I go, I find evidence of enthusiasm on the part of the people, readiness on their part to open out their hearts to the so-called untouchables, the Harijans. Wherever I go, I find a readiness on the part of the people to part with their possessions, to part with their coppers, with their silver, with their gold and women are not behind men in making their sacrifices. I know for certain that they know for what purpose they have given their bangles or their rings or whatever they hold very dear. They know that all these moneys and all these ornaments are being given in order that Harijans may be served. This cause, the more I think about it the more I feel, is a cause for all humanity and for all time. If Hindus succeed in exorcizing this devil of untouchability, if they succeed in transforming their hearts and if they succeed in purifying themselves of this blot, I have no doubt whatsoever that we, all the communities belonging to different religions, will live in happiness, contentment, peace and real friendship of the heart. I have no doubt whatsoever that, if we achieve full success in this mission, in this war against untouchability, as I have said, I have no doubt that we shall be able to achieve the heart unity. Suspicions will melt away before the sunshine of mutual trust, mutual affection and mutual respect. Let us, therefore, you and I and all, pray to God Almighty that He may bless us with sufficient strength and wisdom to see this error and correct it, no matter what it was. Let us remember that all these centuries we have suppressed a portion of ourselves and in so doing we have degraded ourselves, and we have depressed ourselves. No power on earth has yet succeeded in suppressing any portion of humanity without degrading itself and without depressing itself. The more I see, the more I feel that, if we do not drive away this untouchability, Hinduism itself will perish and it will be a loss not only
 
 to us but it will be a loss to the world. A religion that owes its  inspiration to the Vedas, to the Upanishads, to the Puranas, to Ramayana, why should that religion perish—for what purpose, for what reason, except that we did not observe the message of the Upanishads, that we did not observe the grand message, the grand proposition enunciated in the pages of the Vedas, the Upanishads that God alone is and no one else and nothing else ? Do you suppose the preachers of that one God, God of Justice, preached that there could be any divisions of high and low amongst ourselves ? It is an impossible thing. The more one thinks about these things, the more it is surprising that a people so cultured as Hindus are supposed to be, should have hugged untouchability as a part of their religion. And remember lastly that all the religions in the world are today in the melting pot. They are all being critically examined and tested and public opinion will not forgive you and me if we do not energetically drive away this evil from our midst. I must not now take any more of your time on untouchability.libtech_599_footnote
 Mr. Gandhi then said that as he was speaking at Ellore, the headquarters of the Andhra Provincial Anti-untouchability Association, he wished to draw attention to the fact that he had received some complaints against some of its office-bearers. Mr. Gandhi said that he and Mr. Thakkar, the vigilant Secretary of the Central Board, found after investigation that there was absolutely no foundation for the charges made. He always kept his eyes and ears open for receiving any	bona-fide complaints, but he insisted that anybody who complained should do so on two conditions. Firstly, he must announce his name to the public instead of sending anonymous letters and secondly he must substantiate all his allegations by unimpeachable evidence.
 Mr. Gandhi delivered his speech in English and before closing he said that it was a great regret to him to have done so, even in Andhradesha where Hindi had progressed very much. He had to speak in English to facilitate translation. It would not at all be difficult for the Andhras to learn Hindi as many of the words were derived from Sanskrit out of which the Telugu language was formed.

  SPEECH AT WOMEN’S MEETING, VIZAGAPATAM 
 December 28, 1933
 The Harijan cause is like fire. The more ghee you put into fire, the more it requires. So also, the more you give to the Harijan cause, the more it requires. Those who give to the cause gain, they never lose; and those who do not give undoubtedly lose. What you gain by giving is merit. What you lose by not giving is your self. For men and women belonging to savarna Hindu castes have been persecuting Harijans now for ages. And if we are just now passing through evil times, I am convinced that our treatment of Harijans has not a little to do with it. I have, therefore, been asking the women of India to drive away the ghost of untouchability from their hearts. It is wrong, it is sinful, to consider some people lower than ourselves. On God’s earth nobody is low and nobody is high. We are all His creatures; and just as in the eyes of parents all their children are absolutely equal, so also in God’s eyes all His creatures must be equal. Therefore I ask you to believe me when I tell you that there is no sanction in religion for untouchability. I would, therefore, ask you to give a place in your hearts to all the Harijans around you. Welcome Harijan children in your own homes. Go to Harijan quarters and look after their children and their homes; speak to Harijan women as to your own sisters.
 This cause of Harijans is essentially for the women of India to tackle; and I hope that you, the Hindu women of this place, will do your duty. I hope those of you, who have the wish and the ability to surrender all or any part of your jewellery, will do so. There is one condition attached to the gift. If you give anything whatsoever, it must not be replaced. I want you to feel that you personally have given something to this cause, which you cannot do when you give rupees or notes. For they come from either your parents or your husbands. But jewellery is your own property. When you surrender your jewellery without any intention of having it replaced by your parents or husbands, it is definitely your own sacrifice. I want you all who have understood the spirit of the message I have delivered to you to make that definite sacrifice.
 Harijan, 5-1-1934
  
  SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, VIZAGAPATAM 
 December 28, 1933
 You drove me today, on my alighting at the station, through a row of Harijans who were being fed at that time through the charity of some townsman. Whilst he may be entitled to thanks for his liberality, I must confess that it was not a soul-stirring scene. I hung my head in shame as the car was driven through the road along which Harijan men and women were feeding. Just imagine how you and I would feel if some insolent person drove his car through the road where we were taking our meals. I know the custom under which caste dinners are given. All traffic along the road on which dinners are given is entirely prohibited, so that it is possible for diners to have their meals and to be served in perfect peace. As I have said repeatedly, this movement of purification goes down to the roots of our hearts. I have not asked savarna Hindus to appear as patrons before Harijans and throw the leavings of their dishes to them. But I have invited them to open out their hearts to Harijans and to ind there a sanctuary for them. But what I saw today was like the act of a patron towards his dependents. And do you know, not only my car was driven through the rows of people taking meals, but other cars followed and the crowd also followed these cars. And I noticed that it was a hard thing for those poor people to protect their food from dust blowing on it. It was not, to say the least, a becoming performance. And you can now understand my grief at having been obliged to witness it.
 I know there was no evil intention behind this act. I know also that there was not a single person who had any desire to insult these Harijans who were given free meals. I understand also that those who took me through that road thought it would please  me  to  drive through the rows of Harijans taking meals. I know it was nothing but simple thoughtlessness. As we have been told by Shastras, to live a religious life is like walking on the edge of a sword. And in a worldwide movement like this of self-purification among millions of human beings, a single thoughtless act takes the shape of sin. Every act of ours, therefore, in connection with this Harijan movement has to be dictated and dominated by punctiliousness, extreme caution and inward searching. Having witnessed this scene, I thought it would be wrong on my part not to make a public reference to it. By drawing your attention to it, I have endeavoured to warn the public taking part
 in this movement of self-purification against a repetition of the scene of this morning.
 This brings me to what we are doing today through the length and breadth of India. I have not the shadow of a doubt that untouchability is an unmitigated curse on Hinduism. If the Shastras represent the will and wish of God, there can be no warrant whatsoever in them for untouchability, for which you find no parallel in any part of the world save India. It is bad enough when dictated by selfish motives to consider ourselves high and other people low. But it is not only worse but a double wrong when we tack religion to an evil like untouchability. It, therefore, grieves me when learned pundits come forward and invoke the authority of the Shastras for a patent evil like untouchability. I have said, and I repeat today, that we, Hindus, are undergoing a period of probation. Whether we desire it or not, untouchability is going. But if during this period of probation we repent for the sin, if we reform and purify ourselves, history will record that one act as a supreme act of purification on the part of the Hindus. But if, through the working of the time spirit, we are compelled to do things against our will and Harijans come to their own, it will be no credit to the Hindus or to Hinduism. But I go a step further and say that if we fail in this trial, Hinduism and Hindus will perish.
 Harijan, 5-1-1934
 
  NOTES 
 SOME QUESTIONS
 It is wonderful how the very same questions are being asked again and again at the different places visited by me and this by those whom one would expect to be readers of Harijan or otherwise to be acquainted with what I have said on those questions. But so long as they continue to be asked, I suppose I must deal with them and hope that the readers who are familiar with them will not mind the trespass on these columns. I need not repeat the questions. The following answers will suggest the kind of questions asked.
 There 	can be 	no compulsion in 	the matter 	of temple-entry.  No 	temple wil 	be opened 	to Harijans 	without the approval 	of a 	clear majority 	of trustees 	or an overwhelming 	majority of persons 	believing in temple worship and entitled to use the temple in question 
 for purposes of worship.
  There 	is no compulsion 	whatever in the 	Temple-entry Bill 	or the 	Anti-untouchability 	Bill. Harijans 	should be 	subject to 	the same 	rules of 	admission as 	are applicable to 	the other Hindus.  If 	anybody satisfies 	me that 	the Shastras enjoin 	untoucha- bility as it is observed today, I shall at once give up the agitation.  But 	my settled 	conviction is that 	modern untouchability is 	an inhuman 	institution having 	its root 	in selfishness 	and the desire 	for exploitation 	of fellow-beings 	found to be amenable 	to suppression.  The 	untouchables are 	made and 	unmade by 	census enum- 	erators and 	commissioners as 	has been abundantly 	proved in 	these pages. 
 NO TOYS PLEASE
 Andhradesha easily beats other provinces in presenting toys and the like. Some produce little silver cups, some trays, some other fancy things not easily portable. I cannot induce buyers on the spot to bid for numerous things and however tempting they may be for the cause, they become a nuisance to carry and keep count of. I would, there- fore, advise organizers to discountenance, if not forbid, such gifts. In several places heavy frames and portraits have been presented. They become a positive burden and are unsalable in the market. On no account should frames be presented. I would like the tour to retain its serious character and be business-like involving little or no waste in any matter. I may mention incidentally that, in presenting purses, bank-notes should be used wherever possible, instead of coins. In swift travelling, covering ten to fifteen places in a day, it is difficult to count all the cash from day to day and keep accurate accounts. In any case, the accountants, devoted though they are, are over-worked and often have to keep late hours in order to keep themselves up to date. Big organizations like the All-India Harijan Sevak Sangh cannot be effi- ciently and yet cheaply conducted without attention to minutest details and without the intelligent co-operation of the workers and volunteers taking part in it.

   MARWARI RELIEF SOCIETY  
 This Society was established in Calcutta in1923. In the report on the flood-relief work in Orissa sent by Sjt. Harakhchand and pub- lished in the Harijan Sevak, there is a mention of this Society’s valuable services. On my way to Bezwada from Delhi the other day, some workers of the above Society met me at Palwal station. They are helping the flood victims in the district of Gurgaon. At the station they gave me a report containing a detailed account of their work and told me : ‘If you read this, you will know that we made no distinction between untouchables and others; in fact we paid special attention to the poor helpless Harijans.’ The account of the services  rendered from November 19, 1933 to December 13, 1933 is to be found in this report. The Society’s volunteers worked in 144 villages. They distributed 2,809 quilts, 1,846 shirts, 1,256 skirts and 872 maunds, 5 seers of grain among 4,098 flood victims. They distributed medicines to 3,052 patients suffering from itch, cholera, cough and other maladies. Wherever needed, the sick were given milk, barley, sago and other things. Houses damaged by floods are being  rebuilt.  The Society is working in seven places: Palwal, Dighout, Bannikheda, Banchari, Hodal, Hasanpur and Gulabad. I thank the Society and the young volunteers who are working in the above seven places. The number of Harijans and non-Hindus helped by the Society is also separately given in the report. As long as this pernicious tendency towards discriminating between man and man persists, even in times of common relief operations, so long, unfortunately, separate mention of Hindus, Harijans and non-Hindus is and will continue to be necessary in this unfortunate land.

         CHI. 	MANUDI,    LETTER TO MANU GANDHI    December 	29, 1933 
  	I felt happy after reading your long letter. I daily think about 	you. Tell Kusum that I cannot help her now. What will it avail her 	to think of me ? Let her go on repeating Ramanama. It will give her 
 peace of mind. You should teach her to do that. Sing the Ramadhun to her. You can sing many bhajans. What can I say to comfort aunt Bali ? If I were free from other duties, I would go to her and help her run her home and free her from her worries. But it is impossible during this life that I can even stand in such relation to her. What you write about death is perfectly true. It will come to all of us sooner or later.

            BA,    LETTER TO KASTURBA GANDHI    CUDDAPAH STATION,  January 	1, 1934   Send me 	a copy of the discourse I sent you last time.libtech_601_footnotelibtech_602_footnoteI 	got your 
  	letter only today. I am writing this letter on my silence day. Do 	not worry about Manilal. I am sending your letter to him. You need 	not get alarmed by what Pragji said. Both are mature persons. If 	they have made a mistake they will correct it. Arrangement has 	already been made for jame-e-jamshed. Mathuradas informs me 	that this has been done, and so I have done nothing further about 	it. I hope you get it now. All the same, I am inquiring again. I 	will try about the Rama- yana and the Bhagavata. 	Don’t feel the slightest hesitation in writing to Premlilabehn for 	anything you want. After all, what are you likely to want ? What few 	things you want she will send with great love. But about anything 	which you do not require immediately, it will be enough if you write 	to me. I will then make the necessary arrange- ments. Can you use 	your dentures ? Do you gargle with potassium permanganate water ? 	Thakkar Bapa is not in the party with me this time. He will meet me 	on the 15th. Just now Malkani is with me. He also is working very 	hard, along with the others. Chandra-shankar keeps fairly good 	health. Om and Kisan are taking good care of their health. Om works 	as hard as she can. She is a simple-hearted and straightforward 	girl. And so is Kisan. Surendra has regained his strength.  	The Andhra tour ends on the 3rd. After that we shall go to Mysore. 	Wherever I go, there is bound to be a lot of activity and some 	hardships too. But I am carefully protected by everybody and  so 	don’t feel the hardships much. As Mirabehn looks after the 	smallest detail, I don’t feel the discomfort of travelling at all. 	You will be permitted to receive a letter from me every week only if 	you forgo your right of receiving visitors. I for one will go on 	sending  a discourse every week. Be satisfied with visitors who come 	to see the other women. However, do as you wish. If you are keen on 	having visitors, there would be many ready to go. They would even 	wish to go. We have deliberately made it a practice to receive the 	fewest    
 possible visitors. But let me know your wish without any hesitation. Janakibehn is all right. I think I have already written to you about her son Ramakrishna’s tonsils being removed. Kamala has now resumed solid foods. Kishorelal is still not free from fever. But there is no cause for worry. These days my silence commences on Sunday night. I, therefore, don’t speak till Monday night. The silence will be broken today at ten minutes past nine. Hence I shall hardly have to speak to anybody, since soon after it will be time to go to bed. I have to get up at three in the morning. Brijkrishna’s fever has come down. But he has yet to regain strength. Hemibehn is no more. Now the discourse.
 Last time I wrote about the attributes of a bhakta. I also explained that there could be no bhakti without service. This time I will write about how one can serve, since people frequently ask me that question. Some say that service is possible only under certain conditions. Some others that it is possible only after certain studies. I explained last week that these were wrong notions. One can serve under any conditions. If we offer up to Shri Krishna all our gifts and possessions, we shall get full marks. Anybody who can give one crore but gives only half a crore, will not get more than 50 marks. But he who has only one pie and gives it will get 100 marks. If, therefore, you and the other women prisoners there behave in this manner towards the women with whom you come into contact or towards the officials, you are fufilling the dharma of service. Behaving towards the officials in the spirit of service means never wishing them ill, showing them due respect and not deceiving them. All the rules should be obeyed and the women undergoing imprisonment for criminal offen- ces should be treated as if they were your blood-sisters. If you let them feel your love and see your purity of heart, that also will mean practising the dharma of service. In both cases one’s motives must be clean. If a person behaves in a good way with a selfish motive or through fear, his actions cannot be reckoned as service. We often see one person doing a thing with a selfish motive and another doing the same thing with a benevolent motive. There can be no room for self- interest in anything done as an offering to the Lord. One who serves in this manner daily gains more strength. His studies and his work, both are inspired by the motive of service. Even the laughing or playing,eating or drinking of a person who is thus dedicated to service are informed with the spirit of service. All his actions, therefore, will be innocent. The Lord always gives to such bhaktas the strength they need. You probably remember the three verses in the women’s prayer
 which have a bearing on this. They are as follows :
 As for those who worship Me, thinking on Me alone and nothing else, ever attached to me, I bear the burden of getting them what they need.libtech_603_footnote
 With Me in their thoughts, their whole soul devoted to Me, teaching one another, with Me ever on their lips, they live in contentment and joylibtech_604_footnote
 To these, ever in tune with Me, worshipping Me with affectionate devotion, I give the power of selfless action, whereby they come to Me !libtech_605_footnoteRefer to the  Anasaktiyog  for the meaning of these verses. You
will find them in Chapters 9  and  10.  Remember  that   we  read   the
 Gita to put its teaching into practice. All that I have said above is, you should know, on the basis of the Gita.

         CHI. 	PRABHAVATI,    LETTER TO PRABHAVATI    January 	1, 1934 
  	I could not reply to your letter earlier. I get the time only at 3  	a.m. or when I am travelling in a train. This I am writing in a 	train. There is no question of your doing anything else till you 	have com- pletely recovered your health. If Father can spare money, 	you cer- tainly need not hesitate to ask him for help. I don’t 	know how he is financially placed at present. You should ask him and 	find out. One need not hesitate to ask one’s father about his 	financial condition. If he is not in a position to give you any 	help, you may let me know. I will make some arrangement immediately. I 	wrote the above in the train. I will now complete the reply.  	I hope Jayaprakash is benefiting from the treatment. You have not 	told me in your letter how both of you meet your expenses, nor what 	steps have been taken regarding the debt.  	I am in good health. There has been no change in my diet. I have not 	been weighed lately but I think the weight must have in- creased. 	Mirabehn’s health is fairly good. She doesn’t do anything    
 except looking after me. She doesn’t attend meetings. Om and Kisan help her. They attend meetings sometimes. Kisan’s health is improv- ing. Ramnarayan doesn’t seem to be keeping well. He will carry on as long as he can.
 Ba  writes  to  me  from  time  to  time.  Rama,  Ranchhodbhai’slibtech_606_footnotedaughter, has got married. She and her husband came to me at Ellore for my blessings. I have not heard from Manibehn at all.

   LETTER TO MANILAL AND SUSHILA GANDHI  
 January 1, 1934
 
CHI. MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
 I have not yet received the letter which is due from you. I hope you got the long letters which I wrote to you. Ba is worrying about you a great deal in jail. She has been upset by some things that Pragji has said. She believes that you, Manilal, have quarrelled with every- body there. I do not believe this, of course. I merely write what Ba has written to me. She has asked me to convey her exact words. Since she is in jail and can write only one letter, I naturally feel that I should satisfy her wishes, whatever they are. That is the only reason why I have mentioned this.
I keep very good health. The details are always given in
 Harijan.
 Nanabhai continues to be in poor health. Kishorelal has been having fever for a long time and it does not go. I inquire and get reports about him regularly. I trust he will be all right in a few days.
 Santok’s mother has passed away. Kashi’s sister, Hemi, is also dead. Devdas is well. After his release, he will go to Madras to be with Lakshmi at the time of her delivery.
 I don’t think it is necessary for me now to write anything about the differences among you there.
 
 Om has made a copy of Ba’s letter and so I am sending the original to you. Earlier I had intended to send it to Ramdas.

  	Kakasaheb has written a special letter to me about you. I shall 	certainly be happy if you join me. If you find it convenient, you 	may complete the whole tour. Our mode of living is, of course, 	simple. We travel by third class and work hard day and night. We 	have to do physical work and make do with whatever food and 	accommodation we get. If you are physically strong and if your mode 	of living is simple, you will feel no hardship. If you have the 	courage, come and have this experience. I would certainly welcome a 	young man of your ability and straightforwardness. Send a wire if 	you decide to come. We shall be touring in Mysore State for about 	seven days. If, therefore, you come, buy a ticket for Bangalore. You 	will know there where I am touring. Send a telegram to me at 	Bangalore. I will get it wherever I am and will make the necessary 	arrangements. Someone will meet you at Bangalore station. You will 	not be stranded even if the telegram does not reach me.

SURENDRA,  	I learn that you started crying and returned to Bombay out of fear 	of being beaten. There is no reason for you to feel upset or ashamed 	about it. Have you not read how scared I used to be at the age of 	seventeen or eighteen ? I would however also advise you not to go to 	jail out of a false sense of shame. This time a few will have to go 	to jail repeatedly. If on examining yourself you now wish to return 
 home, you may do so. Serve there and go to jail when God prompts you and gives you full courage. Remember that God always gives the strength to bear physical pain to those who have surrendered them- selves completely to him. But such strength is not acquired by thinking. It is a gift from God, which His devotees invariably receive. Follow the course which you find the easiest for yourself. Write to me.

I will of course have a nap during the day. Today also 	there will be no touring. Please don’t worry about me at all. I 	really keep good health.  	Since you don’t write about yourself, I wonder whether you are 	keeping back anything from me. Please don’t.     
 I have been writing to Ba every week and will continue to do so. As desired by her, I send her some discourses on the Gita just as I used to do from Yeravda Mandir.
 Mahadev is now permitted to write and receive only one letter. He tries to include several in one. He will get others’ letters through Jivanji. He is being tested severely indeed. I am sure he will get an
M.A. degree even in this. He is buried in the translation of the Gita.
 You know Kishorelal’s condition. He refuses to part with his fever. He himself has now appointed a committee consisting of Nathlibtech_611_footnoteSwami and Gomati. He will abide by their advice.
 I got a letter from Ba yesterday. Om made copies of it, one of which I am sending to you. Om is a very active girl. Besides, she is eager to learn everything as quickly as she can. Being frank and truth- ful, she is progressing very well. Kisan’s health is not as good as it used to be. Otherwise she also is a hard worker. Both the girls are extremely simple in their habits. They have become intimate friends.
 Radhakant Malaviya came yesterday to see me. He has brought with him a scheme for preserving milk in dry ice and wants my help in carrying it out. But to ask for my help in such an enterprise is as futile as to churn sand for butter. Probably you know that he has been to England for practical training.
 Malkani has been working very hard. He is filling Thakkar Bapa’s place well enough. The entire staff works sincerely and leaves nothing to be desired. So far  the  work  has  been  progress-  ing very well.
 . . .libtech_612_footnoteis now showing his teeth. He has . . .libtech_613_footnoteunder his complete control. He doesn’t intend now to give the sisters their share. He got the power of attorney given by . . libtech_614_footnoteto all three revoked and got a new power of attorney executed exclusively in his name. When I wrote to him protesting against all this, he gave me an evasive reply. I have now writen to Nanalal. But I don’t think it will have any effect.
 Anandi, Bablo. Babu, Mohan, Vanamala, Bachu and Amina’s children are making good progress. Ramnarayan Pathaklibtech_615_footnotegives three hours every week. Jamnadas [Gandhi] remains what he has been, thin and weak. He seems to be uneasy too. I think I wrote to you about the
 
 
 death of Santok’s mother. Prabhudas will settle down to khadi work in some village near his father-in-law’s place. If he continues to be in Almora, the expenses would go up very much.
 Having thus remembered the family budget today, I end this letter here. I am writing to Mani, but I hope her plight is not similar to Mahadev’s. Let me know if you have any information about it.
To you both or rather to all,

          MY 	DEAR DAUGHTER,    LETTER TO AMTUSSALAAM    January 	2, 1934 
  	I must write in English as I must write during the few moments I 	have to spare. You may not blame me if letters I write do not reach    
 you. But you have lost nothing if any letter has not reached you. I am moving about so rapidly that there need be no surprise if some of my letters go astray without anybody’s fault. But my not writing does not mean that I do not constantly think of all of you. I do. But I write sparingly for want of time and in order to enable others to have a chance of writing. My letter to any one of you should be regarded as letters to all.
 By the time you are discharged I shall be travelling in the ex- treme south of India. If you think that it is worth while coming all the way merely to see me, you shall come. I would strongly advise you to restrain yourself and do all the talking through corres-pondence.
 Of course you should see your mother and also Narandas. They are both within easy reach. But the final decision rests with you. My advice to all the others is just what I am giving to you.
I am glad you have kept so well.
 I have heard about Velanbehn and Durgabehn, also Lilavati. They must all write to me when they are discharged. I hope you have all made the best use of your time.
 My health is excellent. The last weight was 108 lb. My food is milk and oranges and one green vegetable plain boiled without salt. I take other fruit when it easily comes my way. This is either fresh grapes or pomegranate. Generally speaking I take no dates at present. I do not seem to need them. My work commences at 3 a.m. and ends generally at 9 p.m. Of course I try to get some sleep in the middle of the day.
 Your Hindi writing as also your Gujarati is not bad. I hope the Ramadan fast has not weakened you. Has Amina been taking it ? Tell her I often receive news about her children who are getting on nicely. I have just got a report from their Urdu teacher.
Love to you all

   LETTER TO SATIS CHANDRA DAS GUPTA  
 January 2, 1934
 DEAR SATIS BABU,
 Your letter of 30th ultimo has given me much relief. The money you have recieved was meant to ease some pressure. It was the utmost that could be given to you. I hope your workers will succeed. It is most exacting and exasperating work. They must be prepared to take insults as cheerfully as they would take cheques and bank-notes.
 I like the idea of Dr. Roy personally fixing the tour programme. I see in the papers received today that he had a serious accident. I hope it is not so serious as reported. I have wired but you will give me full details.
 I am glad you have regained your weight. But  128  is  not enough for your build. There is no reason why you should not have your fine muscles which you used to have before. Regarding the body as God’s instrument, you are bound to keep it as fit as it is possible to keep it consistently with the obvious and necessary limits.
 I hope Arunlibtech_617_footnoteis doing well. He has to attend on me when I tour in Bengal. But he won’t be allowed if he is in a weak state of health.
Love.

 Lakshmi may go to Bardoli for her delivery, otherwise she should get herself admitted in the Vadilal Hospital at Ahmedabad. It has all the facilities, and some Ashram women also are working in it and they will be able to look after her. Let me know if you have any suggestion to make in this regard. I will decide finally after I hear from Marutilibtech_620_footnotelibtech_621_footnoteand Laskhmi. I have made the necessary arrangements for you to get a copy of the Harijanbandhu. Let me know if you do not get it. What help did Sunderjibhai give ? Let me have his address. I have forgotten it completely. A girls’ hostel is being run in the Sabarmati Harijan Ashram. Are you willing to send the girls there ? If yes, I may inquire. They may admit them there. My blessings to all the children.

 January 2, 1934
 
CHI. MATHURADAS,
 I spoke to Shankaran. I also had a talk with a lawyer who is a good man. We came to the decision that Sasmal’s help should be sought. Calling upon the services of a lawyer from outside is correct. There are few lawyers in Madras handling criminal cases, and such as there are, are not of the first rank. That is why people have to look outside. But you have nothing to do right now. If there is anything, I shall let you know. Tell Shankaran that as he has met me, you are not required to do anything.
 As for Ba’s inquiry, I am not aware of any good books in Gujarati except Tribhuvandas’s Nani Shikhaman. A book of this kind is needed for Maruti’s Lakshmi. Do you know of any such book? Write to me if you know of any. Which is the best book of this kind in English? Consult Jivaraj. It is very good that he is well settled. How is
 
 his health? Do you meet Kishorelal often? How is your own health? I have written to Jamnalalji in connection with the money to be paid to Gosibehn for the Harijan work.libtech_622_footnoteTaramati and the child will be doing well.

    LETTER TO HARIJAN WORKERS,        CUDDAPAH, 
  January 2, 1934libtech_623_footnote GANDHIJI	: 	The Harijan movement goes to the root of the evil. If 	untouchability goes, the castes as we know them today go.libtech_624_footnote  HARIJAN 	WORKERS : Surely 	not.    I 			talk of 			the extreme 			form of 			untouchability. But 			the evil is so 			widespread that 			in some 			form or other 			it runs 			through the 			whole Hindu social system and corrupts it. The distinction of high and low is        
 at the bottom of untouchability. If the extreme form goes, the rest is bound to go. If it does not, our movement will be a mere camouflage. So long as the idea of high and low is not abolished, untouchability cannot be said to have been abolished.
  W.	What, 		then, of the varna which you seek to defend ?  
  I 	do. But you must 	know my definition 	of it. 	It is as different 	from the 	present caste 	system as  chalk is  from 	 cheese. Varna 	say I 	understand it 	is an economic law 	which operates, whether 	we know it 	or not. Conformation 	to it will 	bring happiness 	to man- 	kind. Disregard 	for it 	is disrupting society 	today all over 	the world. 	Varna is 	the antithesis 	of the 	doctrine of 	‘might is 	right’. It 	abolishes all 	distinctions between high and low. W.	But 	nobody gives the meaning you give to varna. 
  That 	may be. Evolution of 	human thought 	is evolution 	of the 	meaning of words. 	I have 	no difficulty 	in seeing 	my meaning 	in the 	original mantra from which the theory of varna is derived,libtech_625_footnotelibtech_626_footnotenor in the Gita 	  verses 	  referring 	  to  varna.libtech_627_footnotelibtech_628_footnote.   Regulations  about  dining  and 	marriage have 	no direct 	connection with 	varna. The 	distinguishing feature of 	varna is occupation. W.	Then you will restrict everyone to his father’s occupation ? 
  Neither 	I nor 	anybody else 	can impose the 	restriction on anyone. 	Varnadharma is 	not a 	man-made law 	to be  imposed or relaxed 	at his 	will. It 	is natural to 	man in 	his regenerate 	state. He may 	disregard it 	to his cost. 	Everyone is free 	to follow 	or disobey 	it. It 	was discovered 	in India and followed 	more or 	less  faithfully 	 and knowingly 	for centuries. 	It is being 	followed ignorantly and 	helplessly even 	now by 	the bulk 	of the 	people. In 	the eye of 	that law, Brahmin 	and Bhangi 	are absolutely 	on an equal 	footing. A Bhangi 	who does 	his work 	willingly and faithfully 	will find favour with God. A 	Brahmin who, no 	matter how 	learned he 	may be, does not 	follow his 	calling will 	incur divine displeasure. The 	law does not 	confer privileges, it 	defines duties. Truest 	democracy can be 	evolved only 	by a 	due recognition 	of and 	obedience to 	the law. 	Thus, in my opinion, 	there is 	no evil in 	varna. The 	evil consists in 	considering one 	varna as higher 	than another.  W. 	Surely, the 	varna that you 	describe exists only in 	your imagination ! 	What we 	see around 	us is the 	solid fact of 	hundreds of 	castes, each 	claiming to 	be higher 	than some other. 
 
 G. That is unfortunately so. I am simply answering your question and showing you the vital difference between caste and varna. Castes are a human manufacture, are daily weakening and have to go. Varna as defined by me may be said to exist in  my imagination. Its definition is not imaginary. It is inherent in the mantra on which it is based and is given in so many words in the Bhagavad Gita.

  	I got your letter written from Calcutta. I could not judge from the 	letter whether or not you had met Satis Babu during your stay there. 	I suppose you did meet him. You haven’t mentioned anything about 	your health, either. Write about it in your next letter. The fact 	that Shivprasad escaped unhurt is indeed a remarkable thing. The 	tour is progressing very well. My body is standing the strain better 	than I had expected. There is, therefore, no cause at all for worry. 	Om is doing well enough. She is not a girl who will let others worry 	for her. She is slowly getting trained for the position of 	secretary. She is not      
 vigilant enough to satisfy me, but I don’t wish to goad her to be more sharp at the cost of her health. I ask her to do only as much work as she can do without strain. I am sure you know that Kisan is accom- panying me. She is a very good girl. She has become very friendly with Om. Her health went down in jail. Before that she was fairly strong and was quite smart. The tour seems to have benefited her. At present Malkani is with me. I needn’t say anything about him. He is working hard. Damodar is working satisfactorily. He has proved his sincerity and capacity. Did you send the sum which was to be sent to Delhi from the Harijan account ? Gosibehn will have to be paid something every month. Pay that also from some account. Pay her what Mathuradas suggests. She should have been given the  full  amount from Bombay, but the people there are not giving it. I will write now, but while the correspondence is going on she must get the amount from somewhere.
     PS.  Blessings 	from  BAPU   Before 	Morning Prayer, Wednesday  	How is it that Janakibehn complains against your temper ? If 
  	there is any truth in her complaint, overcome your weakness. I asked 	Om and she also tells me that sometimes you make even Madan  Mohan 	weep.  	Tara has always been a sincere worker. If she keeps good health she 	will fully prove her worth. I had a wire from Dr. Sharma (of Delhi). 	He has sold his property for Rs. 10,000 and paid off his debt. Now 	he wishes to come and live in the Ashram. He will come with his 	wife. I have advised him to write to you. I think he should be taken 	in. If he proves worthy, well and good. Otherwise he will be asked 	to leave the Ashram.  	I hope you work with due regard to your health. Janakibai Somanlibtech_632_footnotewishes  to  stay  there.

N. 2928      SPEECH AT PEDDAVADUGURU    January 	3, 1934  Mahatmaji thanked the people for the address and the purse and said that he    
 would not have any objection for earmarking the sumlibtech_633_footnotefor the Kesava Vidyanilayam—  a residential school for Harijans in memory of the late lamented P. Kesava Pillai— provided a workable scheme and workers were forthcoming. The moneys that were collected would of course be spent for imparting education to Harijans and providing other facilities for their uplift. Neither grants of money nor mere removal of physical untouchability were sufficient to complete the process of purification which the savarna ought to undergo to atone for their past sins and neglect. What  was  necessary was to banish the very idea of distinction between high and low, touchable and untouchable from their thought. This was easy if people could control their mind. But generally the reverse was true and hence the difficulty. Hinduism would suffer extinction if untouchability continued to exist. He prayed the Almighty to give them the will and courage to serve the Harijan cause and remove the evil.

   EXTRACTS FROM SPEECHES TO WOMENlibtech_634_footnote  
 [Before January 4, 1934]libtech_635_footnote
 The real ornament of woman is her character, her purity. Metal and stones can never be real ornaments. The names of women like Sita and Damayanti have become sacred to us for their unsullied virtue, never for their jewellery, if they wore any. My asking from you your jewellery has also a wider significance. Several sisters have told me that they feel all the better for getting rid of their jewels.libtech_636_footnote
 I have  called  this  an  act  of  merit  in  more  ways  than  one. No man or woman is entitled to the possession of wealth, unless he or she  has  given  a  fair  share  of  it  to  the   poor  and  the   helpless. It is a social and religious obligation and has been called a sacrifice by the Bhagavad Gita. He who does not offer this sacrifice has been called a thief.libtech_637_footnotelibtech_638_footnoteThe Gita has enumerated many forms of sacrifice; but what greater sacrifice can there be than to serve the poor and the needy ? For us today there can be no sacrifice higher than to forget the distinctions of high and low and to realize the equality of all men. I also wish to bring home to the women of India that  real ornamentation lies, not in loading the body with metal and stones, but in purifying the heart and developing the beauty of the soul.
 
 On one occasion he recalled to them the sacrifice of the late  Shrimati  Annapurna Devi,libtech_639_footnotewho was the first in Andhra to set to her sisters a noble example of sacrifice and service, and said:
The very first day she met me she took off her ornaments—not
 one, but all. The women who witnessed the scene were amazed at what was happening. And then there was a shower of ornaments. And do you think she looked less handsome because of her having given away the ornaments ? Rather she looked to me more handsome. The English language has the proverb, ‘Handsome is  that  handsome does.’

He 	read in 	their address  that  	there    were    800 	Haijans living in 	Doddaballapur  and 	that fifty per 	cent of 	the Harijan 	children were attending schools. They were entitled 	to congratulations on 	this account. 	But they could 	not possibly 	give themselves 	satisfaction by 	showing that so 	many Harijan children 	attended Harijan school. It 	was absolutely necessary for them to teach Harijan boys and girls and for this it was    
 necessary for them to root out untouchability from their heart. It was wrong to consider a single person as untouchable. They should all forget that any single human being was lower than themselves. In conclusion, Gandhiji hoped that God would give them all strength to blot out the curse of untouchablility.

  January 	4, 1934  Questions 	were put to Gandhiji about temple-entry by Harijans. Gandhiji said 	that the opposition to temple-entry was on the wane and that he 	found practically no opposition through out his present tour to his 	work.  Asked 	what they should do if the majority were in faovur of temple-entry 	and  the 	State remained neutral, Gandhiji said :  	Let the majority and the minority fight it out. The State will not 	interfere. Only when the majority and the minority come to a clash, 	will the Government interfere and that too to maintain peace and 	tranquillity. The majority cannot be obstructed by the minority.  To another 	question, Mahatma Gandhi replied that there was no such thing as 	utter majority.  The 	Hindu, 5-1-1934    414. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, TUMKUR  January 	4, 1934  	It gives me great pleasure to renew my acquaintance with you. I am 	not new to you, nor are you new to me. But the mission that brings 	me here today is different from the mission that had brought me here 	years ago.libtech_641_footnotelibtech_642_footnoteYour address itself has made clear what I expect of 	you. I thank you for the purse that has been presented to me on 	behalf of the Harijans this afternoon. In your address you have 	recounted many of the virtues to which I might even be a stranger. 	You have showered upon me compliments that may be wholly undeserved. 	You have been good enough to admit that you are getting more and 	more convinced     
 that the eradication of untouchability from our society will not only purify Hinduism, but will transmute our national weakness into na- tional strength and bring about greater solidarity among our people professing different religious faiths. After that admission I had expected a recounting on your part of the many things that you might have done on behalf of the Harijans. You express regret that, barring a few individual efforts, you have done little yet for the removal of untouchability. Happily the best of our ability requires the purification of our own hearts. If we really mean that on God’s earth there is no one low and no one high, we shall accomplish the mission that has brought me here today. This belief in the distinction between the high and the low has eaten into the very vitals of Hinduism and what I have stated from a thousand platforms is but this simple truth that, if we do not now get rid of this canker, there is the impending danger of Hinduism itself perishing. I therefore hope and pray that every one of those who are here present at this meeting will realize the truth of what I have said and will make the best possible effort to get rid of this curse of untouchability.
 Proceeding, Mahatmaji expressed his regret at not being able to visit all parts of the town as he would have wished. Owing to physical weakness, it was not possible for him to visit public institutions doing useful work. He hoped that the people of Tumkur would take the will for the deed.

415. SPEECH AT WOMEN’S MEETING, BANGALORElibtech_643_footnote
 January 4, 1934
 SISTERS,
 It gives me much pleasure to see you again after a lapse of many years. You have in the opening portion of your address expressed anxiety about my health on account of the constant travels. Who would show anxiety, if not you the mothers of India, for your children ? And I am one among the millions of your children. But you should know that the way you can relieve my anxiety is by doing according to the message that I have come to tell you. You can relieve my anxiety by paying handsomely for the mission that I am con- ducting. Sisters in other parts of India, having felt the same anxiety
 
 
 that you feel, have showered their jewellery, their bangles, their rings, and their necklaces on me. The silver and copper that you may give me is, truly speaking, according to our custom, not your property. That belongs to your parents or to your husbands. But what I want is something that you can definitely call your own and that can only be your jewellery. But the giving up of your jewellery is the least of all the things that I want you to do. It can only be a singing of your determination to carry out the message to its full extent. And that message is that you should consider the Harijans as your own blood brothers and blood-sisters and as your own children. It is wrong and sinful to consider a single human being as an untouchable. God has created all men and women alike. Although our forms may be different and our dispositions may be different we are still, at the bottom, one. Even as the leaves of one tree are one, whether they are small or big, so I want you to have no distinction of untouchable and touchable. And that is what I call purification of the heart.

 416. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, BANGALORE
 January 4, 1934
 FRIENDS,
 I am deeply touched by your welcome. I do not want all this enthusiasm of yours and all this exhibition of affection towards me to waste away without turning them to good use. If you therefore have patience with me for a few brief moments, you will see that I turn all that enthusiasm and affection to good account. What I am about to do will also be a test of the genuineness of your enthusiasm and your affection.
 You know the message that I want to tell you. I would like us all, every one of us, to purify our heart of the curse of untouchability. In one of the many addresses that I had the honour and pleasure of receiving today after entering the border of Mysore State, it was truly stated that this curse of untouchability had permeated Hindu society to such an extent that it almost ruled our lives and the signatories to the address were good enough to say that the message I was trying to deliver to the Hindus of India was producing its effect and went on to admit that, if we could but get rid of this poison of untouchability, all our differences even between different communities would vanish.
 There you see what I am asking every one of us to do. I am pleading with you that we should get rid of this position of untouchability all along the line, so that we won’t have only a particular class labeled as Harijans but we should all become Harijans, namely, and truly,  children of God.
 Today if we appeared before our Maker with this uncleanliness in our hearts, He will disown us because we have ourselves become disinherited. And this little purse that you have given me, I regard as earnest of your determination that you will henceforth cease to regard any being on earth as lower than yourselves. If among earthly parents there is no grade among their children, do you think that God has grades among His children, the God Whom we consider as the One and only Being, if He may be called a being, Who holds the scales of justice absolutely even ? If you have actually understood the spirit of my message, you will understand when I say to you that those who give to the Harijan cause gain. I go further and contend that you can never give to much too this cause.

 417. PLEA FOR CATHOLICITYlibtech_644_footnote
 During my frequent travels I have noticed that the reception committees are not too mindful of expense in catering for the wants of guests. They will insist on producing sweets or other delicacies and a multiplicity of dishes. I have firmly discountenanced these at all times, but this time when I am making collections for the Harijan cause, which I regard as a mission of penance and purification, I feel pained when there is any attempt at lavish hospitality. In two places I observed that Gujarati cooks were brought in to produce Gujarati dishes. I regard this as a wholly unnecessary procedure. I believe that we should be able to accommodate ourselves to the food eaten in the provinces other than our own. I know that this is not so simple a question as it appears. I know southerners who have made a Herculean effort to take to Gujarati food and failed. Gujaratis will not take to the southern mode of cooking. Bengal produces dainties which the other provinces will not easily relish. If we would be national instead of provincial, we would have to have an interchange of habits as to food, simplify our tastes and produce healthy dishes that all can take with impunity. This means a careful study of the foods taken by different
 
 provinces, castes and denominations. Unfortunately, or fortunately, there are not only different combinations in different provinces, but there are different styles in the same province, among the different communities. It is necessary, therefore, for national workers to study the foods and the methods of perparing them in the various provinces and discover common, simple and cheap dishes which all can take without upsetting the digestive apparatus. In any case it must be a matter of shame for workers not to know the manners and customs of different provinces and communities. In liberal household  cooks ought to be able to cook foods eaten in the various provinces. Why should not a Gujarati be able to produce dishes which a Tamilian or an Andhra or a Bengali ordinarily eats ? I know that we cannot meet at the top. Nor is such a meeting necessary or desirable. Rich people will have not only provincial combinations but specialities designed for their own households. These cannot be universalized. What can be and should be aimed at are common dishes for common people. This I know is easily possible if we have the mind. But to make this  possible, volunteers will have to learn the art of cooking and for this purpose they will have also to study the values of different foods and evolve common dishes easily and cheaply prepared.
 I have strayed somewhat from my main purpose which is to ask organizers of the tour in the provinces not to pamper us but to be rigorously simple and economical in catering for us. We  are  or  profess to be conducting a mission of self-purification and represen- ting the cause of the outcastes of Hindu humanity. As such we have no right to the satisfaction of any but the barest wants and creature comforts. Fried things and sweets must be strictly eschewed. Ghee ought to be most sparingly used. More than one green vegetable simply boiled would be regarded as unnecessary. Expensive fruit should be always avoided. I know that I am the culprit in the matter of fruit. Friends would pamper me and go out of the way to procure the richest fruit for me. I can only assure them that I do not need any other fruit than oranges, which experience has proved to be necessary for me. In spite to all my vaunted abstinence,I know that of my party I am the costliest member to feed. I am sorry that it should be so, but mother goat to whose milk I owe my bodily strength and sister orange who keeps me fresh cannot compete in cheapness with rice and wheat. Let not my numerous hosts, however add to my indebtedness by importing tempting superfluities. Let them not pander to my weak- nesses, if they will help me to do my duty towards Harijans.

She had six brothers and sisters of whom some had died. Still 	she used to say that they were seven.libtech_652_footnoteThat implied great wisdom. For, it is not through the 	body that somebody is a brother or  a sister. It is through the soul 	dwelling in the body that one is a

 424. SPEECH AT HARIJANS’ MEETING      MYSORE, 
  January 5, 1934 You should conform to the rules of 	hygiene and sanitation— internal as well as external. Internal 	sanitation consists in taking the  	name of God—the first thing to be done after getting up in the 	morning. That is the breakfast for the soul.  When he was told 	that the Harijans of the locality had given up beef- 
 eating, he added :
 It is a matter of deep joy to me and congratulation for you that you have given up beef-eating. I would like you to be able to say the same thing about drink. What is the use of paying for some coloured water which makes us so mad that we forget the distinction between mother, wife and sister ? I have heard Harijans telling me that drink is prescribed for them on occasions of marriage and death. I can tell you, without fear of contradiction, that is a suggestion of the devil. It is nowhere written in scriptures. I would ask you, brothers and sisters, not to go near the devil. I hope you will take my advice to heart and it will give me great joy when you will be able to say that you have given up drink also.
 Harijan, 12-1-1934
 
 425. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, MYSORE
 January 5, 1934
 It has given me much pleasure to renew acquaintance after six long years. As you are aware, I came to Mysore State in order to regain my health that I had lost during the tour which I was conduc- ting at that time. And naturally I have the most pleasant recollections of my stay in Mysore. From His Highness the Maharaja Saheb and his Dewan and other officials to the subjects of H.H. the Maharaja Saheb, I experienced nothing but the warmest affection. You can, therefore, understand more fully probably than before how much joy it must have given me to have come in your midst again You have added to the joy and pleasure by asking me to perform the ceremony of unveiling a portrait of the late Sjt. Venkatakrishnayya, the Grand Old Man of Mysore. I congratulate the artist upon his effort, because it is a faithful representation of the figure which was quite famliar to me. Perhaps, all of you do not know that I had the pleasure and privilege of seeing the Grand Old Man of Mysore in flesh and blood during my last visit. I had then become acquainted with his many virtues. I knew than that he occupied a unique place in your hearts. I am quite sure you do not expect me or want me to recount his many virtures. You who were on the spot knew them much better than I could possibly do during a brief visit. I only hope that those of his virtues for which you and I prize his memory will be translated into our lives. We may not flatter ourselves with the belief that we have discharged the   obligation  to   his  memory  by  your  inviting  me   to   unveil this
 
 portrait and witnessing the ceremony and by my unveiling it.
 I must now pass on to the mission that has brought me here. The Municipal address reminds me that I should see things which are worth seeing, so that I may carry away happy impressions of the effort that has been and is being made here on behalf of the Harijans. The Reception Committee with very great forethought had arranged to take me, before bringing me to this meeting, to various  cherieslibtech_653_footnotelibtech_654_footnoteand showed me the improvements made during these six years. And you are quite right in thinking that after an examination of these places I should carry away nothing but happy impressions of what has been done on behalf of Harijans. I must congratulate the State and the Municipality of Mysore on the neatness and cleanliness I observed in all the places visited this afternoon. And I am glad for the assurance that the Municipality will not lose any time in looking after the domestic comforts of the Harijans of this city. In my opinion,  sweepers in every city are its noblest servants. It must be a matter of humiliation and shame to have the sweepers and scavengers consigned to the dirtiest places and utterly neglected. In my opinion, they hold the key of the health of every city in their pockets. Any city that dares neglect its scavengers and sweepers commits the crime of neglecting the health of its citizens.
 But my mission covers a much wider theme than the econo- mic welfare of Harijans. We are, no doubt, bound  to  jealously guard their economic and educational welfare.  But  this  is  not enough, if we are do reparation to Harijans for the untold hardships to which we have subjected them for centuries past. They are entitled to precisely the same rights and privileges as any other citizen. And as Hindus they are entitled to the same social amenities and religious privileges that any other Hindu is entitled to. My mission, therefore, is to invite savarna Hindus to wash themselves clean of the guilt of untouchability. And if, during the short period of grace open to savarna Hindus, they fail to do this duty, I have not the shadow of a doubt that Hinduism will perish. You can now understand that this cannot be done by a municipality or even the  Maharaja  Saheb himself. If you and I will not change our hearts, what can even Rajas and Maharajas do ? It is, therefore, my privilege, as it is my duty, to invite you to cleanse your hearts of untouchability, the distinction of high and low. If you understand thoroughly the spirit of this message,
 
 the change of heart is an incredibly simple performance; and you can see in the twinkling of an eye how, if this change comes about in savarna Hindu hearts, the economic, social and religious progress of Harijans must follow. It will then be a sign and seal of this change of heart. All these purses you have been kind enough to give me I consider as an earnest of your determination to make that change of heart. May God give you the strength to do it and save Hinduism from impending doom.
 Harijan, 12-1-1934
 
 426. EXTRACTS FROM SPEECHES libtech_655_footnote
 [Before January 6, 1934]
 You should know that our duty to Harijans does not end with giving them good houses or giving them separate wells, schools and so on. If we gave them all these and still kept them untouchables, it would only mean replacing iron chains by golden ones; but the slave would still be a slave. Harijans must have all the amenities that we enjoy. But I go further and say, you must absorb them, you must bridge the gulf that lies today between them and you. The purification we are striving for is not complete till we have purged our hearts of this distinction. You and I may not be satisfied with anything less.libtech_656_footnote
 You,  mothers,  should  wash  your  children every   day,   and so should you wash yourselves. In the morning you  should have what I call internal wash, that is to say, the first thing you should do on getting up is to take Ramanama and then pray to God that you should pass the day in sacredness, so that no wrong word may pass your lips and no wrong act may be done by you. And then you should give yourselves an external wash.
 At Anantapurlibtech_657_footnote, opening a water-tap for them, he said :
 May this water be the water of life to you. Water is an emblem of purity. Just as we purify the body by bathing with water, so can we become pure in heart by a morning wash, i.e., by taking the name of God.
I am trying every moment of my life to be guided by ahimsa,
 
 
 by love. I am essentially a lover of peace. I do not want to create dissensions. And I assure those who oppose me that I shall not do a single thing which I know may be contrary to truth and love.libtech_658_footnote
 But we have created a hope in the hearts of Harijans. They have begun to feel that they are going to be freed from this serfdom. I expect of you that you will fulfil it. It is said in all religions of the world that, if the poor are deceived, if the hopes given to them are not fulfilled, they heave a sigh of despair, a curse. And I have no doubt that, if, after all that we have said and promised, we play false, the curse of these poor people is bound to descend on us and we shall perish.

 BHAI PARIKSHITLAL,
 At the moment I cannot think of anything that I can do from here about the laws regarding Bhundi Bhunchhilibtech_659_footnotelibtech_660_footnote. You have done the right thing in writing to the Dewan. Please let me know if there has been any reply from him. If I get an authoritative report on  the subject from a newspaper correspondent in Kutch, I would publish it in Harijan. Is the report that you have received authentic ? Please inquire and let me know. Try and get a copy of the legislation. Most probably it was published in Navajivan. The cheque which Chhagan- lal Joshi has sent to you is an instalment of that sum of Rs. 5,700. I had made arrangements for it before I got your letter regar-ding the use of a disinfectant. Hence the cheque. I will discuss the  matter further when I meet Thakkar Bapa on the 16th.

 428. SPEECH AT STUDENTS’ MEETING, BANGALORE
 January 6, 1934
 A servant of Harijans must be above suspicion like Caesar’s wife. He must have a character above reproach. His eyes must be clean so that they may not offend. His hands also must be clean and his touch must be pure and gentle. His heart will not harbour a single impure thought. His ears must be turned to listen to the music of the spheres, his feet will take him to the purest work, never to dens of evil and he will give his ear to all he hears but will spare his voice.
 In the end Gandhiji exhorted them to join one of the greatest of reform movements in modern times.

 430. SPEECH AT APEX BANK HALL, BANGALORE libtech_661_footnote
 January 7, 1934
 My connection with the co-operative movement is of a per- functory character. I tried to understand it as interpreted by Sir Daniel Hamilton I know what boon it can become to agriculturists. I wish to tell you what I said long ago at a co-operatives’ meeting at Bombay, when I had the honour of being invited by Lord Willingdon         It is
 necessary for co-operative societiesto trace the course of every pice lent. Find out what the borrower is doing with his money. This thought has never left me.libtech_662_footnote
 
 Gandhiji made a touching reference  to  the  late  Mr.  K.  H.  Ramayya, Registrar of Co-operative Societies. He said that while he was in Bangalore six years ago, he used to meet the late Mr. Ramayya often and used to cut jokes with him. It was only yesterday that he had learnt of the passing away of Mr. Ramayya. Mahatma was really sorry for this. The great work that he had done for the cause of Co-operation in the State was too well-known to need repetition by him.

 431. SPEECH AT CIVIC RECEPTION, BANGALORE
 January 7, 1934
 I am deeply grateful to the Bangalore City Municipality for presenting me with this address. You have reminded me in your address that you were good enough to do me the honour of giving me such an address when I was in your midst last time. And it flatters me to see that I still retain a corner of your hearts. I tender you my congratulations upon all the things that you have done and are doing on behalf of the Harijans whose cause has brought me here. I tender also my respectful congratulations to His Highness for the liberality with which his Government has been dealing with this problem. You have admitted in your address that, while so much is being done by the Municipality for the Harijans, much more yet remains to be done. It would be wrong on my part if I did not re-echo that sentiment expressed in your address. During the morning peregrinations, I had the painful duty of witnessing some of the habitations occupied by the Harijans. It is difficult to call them even huts. I had, therefore, not hesitated to describe them as ‘holes’. These holes are no protection whatever to the Harijans against wind, rain and sun. These dwellings are built of debris, which the Harijans could lay their hands upon.
 You have every right to pride yourselves upon the beauty of Bangalore. I am free to confess that Bombay  cannot  be  described as ‘Bombay, the beautiful’. There are such hideous and ugly spots in Bombay that it is a misnomer to call that city ‘beautiful’. Comparative speaking, therefore, I have no hesitatio whatever in giving Bangalore the first prize for a beautiful city. But I would like you not to be satisfied with the comparative merit. I would like you to set before yourselves a minimum standard of comfort for the poorest of your citizens.
 Proceeding, Mahatmaji thanked the citizens for the kind invitation extended to him to come over to Bangalore and stay for a short time after his all-India tour.
 I have experienced so much kindness and so much attention that I assure you that I need no temptation whatever to bring me here if only the call of duty enables me to take advantage of your hospitality and your climate.
 Mahatma Gandhi next said that the touching reference in the address to the absence of his wife had moved him deeply. They had taken the way that duty had shown them. Her duty had taken her away to Yeravda and his duty had him in their midst. He assured them that nothing would give them both greater pleasure than to enjoy their hospitality once more.

 432. SPEECH AT TEMPERANCE ASSOCIATION, BANGALORE
 January 7, 1934
 It is a matter of pleasure to me that you have invited me to meet you and say a few words on the subject of temperance. Some of you perhaps know that this is one of the matters that I took up before I was known to anybody and before I had conceived the  thought  of entering the political arena. When as a young man I went to South Africa, I observed that the coolies, indentured Indians, were fast going down owing to the drink habit. The law in South Africa made it a crime for indentured Indians to carry drink home. They could drink as much as they liked at the canteen. The result was that many women were found literally lying in gutters. It was not a thing of which any Indian could be proud. I pleaded with the Government, but mine was a voice in the wilderness. So the thing went on. But it made a lasting impression on my mind. I knew what I had to do when I came to India after a long exile.
 I am not a  temperance  man.  I  am  a  prohibition  man.  I fought with my countrymen in South Africa and said, “We should not fight for an equal right to drink.” I could not persuade them  for a long time, but I did succeed in persuading a majority of them that to fight for rights was one thing and to fight for indulgence in vice was another. If the whites were not punished by the State for drinking, we could not plead for the same exemption. Here, in India, the Government are trading in liquor. I know from bitter experience of Harijans that they drink in spite of themselves. I have in mind an esteemed co-worker in Calcutta, namely, Satis Chandra Das Gupta. He
 gave up a remunerative job. He was and is still considered the right- hand man of Dr. Roy. He gave up his chemical work and today he lives near bastis. He administered pledges to Harijans not to drink. These they broke again and again. That broke his heart and he fasted for 15 days. It had a marvellous effect on the Harijans. They said they would not now go back on their pledges. Satis Babu  had  to  go through that agony. It was a joy for him. A worker who fights drink tooth and nail has to go through this. Many Harijans have said to me, “Take away this temptation from us and we shall be all right. Do not put it in our way.” When we are not able to control ourselves in so many things, how much less can the Harijans and  the  labourers control themselves ? I have lived, eaten and drunk with them. They have no places of recreation. They live in wretched holes. They have no money to spend for creature comforts. What little they get, therefore, goes to canteens. I only give you the description to show you how keenly and bitterly I feel in connection with the drink evil. I have not the shadow of a doubt that we shall not be able to combat this evil successfully till prohibition comes. I have fixed views about prohibition. I have given you the result of my experience that, without prohibition, it is impossible to bring about sober habits among the labouring population in India. And I have observed that the Harijans are most addicted to this vice. India is a country in which total prohibition can succeed. People are not habitually given to drink. It is not a fashionable vice. The climate does not demand its use. But government revenue is touched by prohibition. Therefore they say, “Find other sources of income before you ask us for total prohibition.” I say, “If you get revenue from impure sources and then say, ‘Replace this revenue,’ you cannot be heard. There should be no bargaining about it.”
 Harijan, 19-1-1934
 433.  SPEECH  AT  PUBLIC  MEETING,  BANGALORElibtech_663_footnote
 January 7, 1934
 It gives me very great pleasure to see Mr. V. P. Madhava Raolibtech_664_footnotepresent here. I had the pleasure of meeting him six years ago when I was in your midst. That, in spite of his advanced age, he should have come here to give me his blessings must move the hardest heart. I regard it as a blessing for the Harijan work I am doing and it is a matter of great joy and solace that such a great gathering of learned men of Mysore who have seen so much life should be here to bless his movement. But, I miss the presence, at this meeting, of Mr. Humza Hussain, who was the Chairman of the Reception Committee when I came here six years ago. I have a vivid recollection of his many kindnesses and how I wish he had been here at this meeting to greet me as on old friend. May God give his soul peace.
 I am very grateful to you for the purse that you have presented me. I was almost going to say a “good purse”, but I have hesitated to use this adjective, because I know that the citizens of Bangalore are quite able to put together a larger purse and I know that by the time I say goodbye to you, I shall have many generous contributions to the cause of Harijans. After all, it is the least reparation that we can do to these brothers and sisters whom Hindus have systematically suppressed.
 I have read your address from top to bottom. And I congra- tulate you and the Maharaja Saheb’s Government on the many things that you have been able to recite in that address. But, neither the State nor the people of Mysore nor I can find any cause for satisfaction unless untouchability is entirely rooted out from our hearts. While I gratefully acknowledge all that you have done for Harijans, I ask you not to rest content till all Harijans enjoy all the rights that savarna Hindus enjoy in all walks of life. Let us undergo this necessary purification, while there is this brief moment  of  probation still left  to us by God. Be sure, if you fail in this hour, God’s wrath will swiftly descend on the Hindus.
 But, one word to Harijan brothers and sisters. You cannot be free from this self-purification. You too have to make your sacrifices at the common altar. And that consists in the strict observance of
 
 sanitation, internal and external. Secondly, in giving up carrion and beef-eating wherever that habit still persists. In every part of the civilized world, carrion is abhorred with detestation. It is considered unfit for human consumption. And no one can call himself a Hindu and partake of beef. The sacredness of the cow and her worship is an integral part of Hinduism. Thirdly, I would ask every Harijan man and woman present here to give up the habit of drink. Let no Harijan say that savarna Hindus also drink. It is no answer. I would beseech you, as a fellow Harijan by calling, to shun all the vices of savarna Hindus. In spite of all the reparations that savarna Hindus make to you, in the presence of God after all, in the ultimate end, your salvation rests in your own hands. It was therefore a matter of great joy when day before yesterdaylibtech_665_footnoteHarijans gave me their assurance that they had given up beef-eating and would try to give up drink. Let us all pray to God that He may give strength to the Harijans to carry out their resolve to leave off drink.

  	after some wandering. I hope you are getting the newspaper now. You 	must have received the Bhagavat and the Ramayana. 	Write for anything else you may wish to have. I had a letter from 	Manilal, as also one from Sushila. They are both well. Manilal is 	unperturbed and asks you not to worry about him. Sita is growing up 	fast. She is always playing about. Devdas has been released earlier 	than expected. He has gone to Ahmedabad. I had a wire from him. 	Perhaps he will visit you.    
 There were letters from Ramdas and Nimu too. I keep on writing to Manu, but again there has been no letter from her. Kishorelal’s fever has come down a little and so it can be hoped that he will have fully recovered in a few days. There is nothing but good news about Mani. Om, Kisan, Chandrashankar, etc., are all well. I am in Bangalore today. Everyone has been inquiring after you. Shankerlal and  Gulzarilal  have come here. There is to be a meeting of the Panch regarding the workers’ wages. Tomorrow is Tuesday, and so it will meet tomorrow. Afterwards I have to go to Malabar. I will be going to the area which you once visited. Urmila Devi’slibtech_670_footnotelibtech_671_footnoteson has a job in Madras now. I keep good health. There is no cause at all for worry. At every place people come in large crowds and give me purses, jewellery, etc. Kanti is better now. I see that Bal will be seeing me in a few days. His health also is quite good. I hope all of you there are well. What progress have Shanta and Lalita made in their studies ? And now the discourse.
 Today I will write something about what the Gita says concerning yajna. The subject is introduced in Chapter III. In that chapter the Lord says that he who eats without performing yajna eats   stolen foodlibtech_672_footnotelibtech_673_footnote. This is a   very  serious    statement    indeed,    for eating stolen food is like swallowing raw mercury. Nobody can digest it and, if anyone eats it, he will get eruptions all over the body. Hence Akho Bhagat has said : “Eating stolen food is like swallowing raw mercury.” If, therefore, a person stops performing yajna even for a while, he becomes a thief. All of us should know that this yajna means. Fortunately for us, it is easy for all whose heart is in the right place. It requires no wealth, no intellect nor education. Yajna means any act of service. Only about a person whose whole life is a ceaseless yajna can it be said that he does not eat stolen food. Hence those who do just a little work as yajna may be said to be not guilty of theft to that extent. Looking at the matter from this point of view, we see that all of us are guilty of theft more or less. Our yajna can be said to be perfect only when we have shed all selfishness. To do this means to give up the sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, to cease feeling that this belongs to me and that to somebody else, that this is my son and  that somebody else’s. There should not be even a trace of such a feeling in one’s heart. He alone can do this who offers up his all to Shri Krishna. He who has done that does everything with God as witness, as
 
 His servant and in a spirit of service. Such a person is always happy and peaceful in mind. Happiness and sufferring are the same to him. He uses his body, mind, intellect, possessions—all that is his—for the service of others. All of us cannot do such perfect yajna. If, however, we have the aspiration in our heart to serve the whole world, what work is there which most people can do and which would include service to the whole world ? Asking this question, we found that the answer was spinning, which is the work that countless people can do in the spirit of service. One who spins will have done that much labour for the service of the world. But I mention this only as an example. What I wished to explain was the meaning and importance of yajna. I shall be satisfied if I have been able to explain it.

 January 8, 1934
 BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
 After completing a letter to Ba, I am writing this to you. It is now past four in the afternoon. It is my weekly Silence Day. We are in Bangalore today. Tomorrow there is a meeting of the Panch to consider the demand of the [Ahmedabad] mills for a reduction in the workers wages. Shankerlal [Banker], Gulzarilal and others  have already arrived. The mill-owners will arrive tomorrow. I have told them that I would be able to give five hours for the meeting. We are leaving for Malabar tomorrow night.
 The pressure of work remains heavy. But I keep good health. Subba Raolibtech_674_footnotecame and examined me yesterday. He was pleased. The blood pressure was 155-100. This is excellent. At the moment it is expected that Thakkar Bapa will meet me in Calicut on the 16th.
 I am staying here in a State buildinglibtech_675_footnote, the same where I had put up before. The people’s enthusiasm is great. The Dewan came and saw me. He talked a great deal about you. He has sent his salaams to you. He shows very great love.
 
 I had a letter from . . .  libtech_676_footnoteHe wanted my permission to sell off  his car. Soon after, I got a wire from Thakkar Bapa, informing me that he was really willing to sell it. I, therefore, gave my consent, although I didn’t understand the position at all. In such matters I depend entirely on you. I, therefore, often follow the example of Ekalavya. He made a clay image of Dronacharya and learnt archery by practising before it so that he could become Arjuna’s equal. I form a mental image of you and consult it. Assuming that you would advise me to give my consent in this matter, I sent a wire saying yes.
 Napoleonlibtech_677_footnotelibtech_678_footnotehas   been    very    much    affected    by    the    death of Kunvarji’s wife. I see this from his loving reply to my letter of  condolence. I have written to him again. I see from .  .  . ’slibtech_679_footnotelibtech_680_footnoteletter that he is not happy. I have asked him what the reason is.
 Munshi has resumed practice. You must have read about Jivraj. Dr. Bidhan may be said to have returned from the jaws of death.
He tells me so in reply to a  wire which I  had sent to him. A  bone is
fractured. He will have to be in bed for some 15 days at least.
 I had a letter from Mama in which he has referred to a letter of yours. He says that it is not practicable now to collect separate contributions and keep separate accounts for the Harijan work, nor will the people give such contributions. Hence, for Navasari, Godhra and other centres for which separate funds and accounts were being maintained, budgets within our means have been passed and it has been decided to obtain the money from the funds of the Harijan Sevak Sangh. The control of the institutions concerned will not be changed. The only change will be that they will receive reasonable grants and will run under the supervision of the Harijan Sevak Sangh. Their independent existence will in no way be endangered. Mama has volunteered to devote himself wholly to this work for the present. I plainly refuse to guide anbody. I don’t feel inclined in my heart to do so. If you have any questions to ask or wish to know more about the Harijan Sevak Sangh, you can write to me. I don’t know what I should tell you. If, however, you give me the slightest indication as to what you want, I will give, that is, send all the required information. You need have no fear that I myself will write out the reply. I spare my hand and brain unnecessary exertion and economize time in
 
 doing my work.
 Devdas has been released before his time. There was a wire from him. He will of course come and see me. The wire was sent from Ahmedabad. Most probably he will pay a visit to Ba.
 Manilal and Sushila write to me. His affairs are all right. Keshu also has got a good job. Ramdas is very much upset. He can enjoy no peace of mind at all.
 It seems that Kishorelal is steadily improving. Brijkrishna has survived. He can walk a little now. Jamnalal has a cold and so on. Shankerlal thinks that his health is certainly not too good. But his weight has increased and he has now reached about 200 lb.
 Om and Kisan are quite well. And so is Mirabehn, of course.
 Blessings to both from
 BAPU

 January 8, 1934
 CHI. SHANTIKUMAR,
 I am often hoping for a letter from you and when I don’t get any I take it that you have refrained from writing out of consideration for me.
 I hope the operationlibtech_681_footnotewent off well. Please write or get someone to write to me sometimes. Normally, I am told, it is a simple operation.
I suppose you do read Harijan. God is protecting my health.
 Blessings to you both from

It is safer to write at the Wardha address.

  LETTER TO K. M. MUNSHI 
 
 January 8, 1934
 I 	have your letter. I have not received Lilavati’s so far.  	I will send you the literature on the Bills regarding 	untouchability. If I cannot get a whole loaf of bread I shall be 	willing to accept even a quarter. It is only when I am offered 	instead of bread a stone purporting to be bread that I refuse to 	accept it. But I have no fear that you will ever give me a stone 	instead of bread. Please, therefore, continue to give me whatever 	you can.  	I see no harm if a party like the one you suggest comes into 	existence. Please go through the changes that I have made in your 	draft.libtech_682_footnoteThe 	reference to civil disobedience is not proper. An element of 	corruption had certainly crept into it. But even a reference to that 	is completely out of place in this draft. Our opponents are bound to 	take advantage of it. We might even take that risk if such reference 	were relevant. Nor was corruption the cause of my suspending that 	part of civil disobedience which I have done.  	This party is not being formed in order to attract other parties to 	it. The reason for forming it is that those Cogressmen who do not or 	cannot take part in the civil disobedience movement desire to ensure 	their continued [political] existence and to do some service. I,  	therefore, consider any reference to other parties  as  unnecessary. 	After the party is formed, it may start negotiations with other 	parties for any purpose. What its name will be will have to be 	thought over. Just as you thought it proper to consult me, I would 	advise you to consult Jawaharlal too. If you endanger your health by 	running about too much, you are going to hear from me.  Blessings 	to you both from  BAPU   From 	Gujarati : C. W. 7530. Courtesy : K. M. Munshi            
  LETTER TO RAMDAS GANDHI 
 
 
BANGALORE,
     CHI. 	RAMDAS,  January 	8, 1934 
  	I got both your letters. Do not worry about your having opened 	Manilal’s letter. You are free to open any letter. How can I 	possibly keep anything secret from you all. You fear your own 	shadow, fancying a whole lot of misfortunes. Both of you have 	resolved to stay on there and have the necessary experience. You 	should therefore stick to the place now. Go on cheerfully doing what 	you can and be happy. If you do that, you will certainly get over 	your diffidence.  	I may say I have now begun to understand why you suffer. Without 	knowing it, you are trying to appear better than you are, wish to do 	so, but you should check such a wish. One should not feel miserable 	at what one is. One should try to  improve  oneself  but should not 	worry ifone fails. That is the essence of the Bhagavad Gita’s 	teaching and therein lies true. Humility you have in ample 	measure but you feel sore in your mind fancying that you lack 	something. To do so is the very opposite of humility. Humility 	always makes one contented with what one is. Why should you, seeing 	someone’s palace, pull down your little hut? Why should you not 	think of your hut as much better than a palace? It is not true that 	those who live in palaces are happier than those who live in huts. 	Happiness consists in being contented.  	Why need you feel sore over your inability to overcome your impure 	thoughts? Everyone in this humility world is full of blemishes. Out 	of countless persons who try to overcome their impure thoughts, only 	one succeeds in doing so. The vast majority should be satisfied with 	doing the best they can and leave the result to God.  	You need not feel the least constraint in writing anything to me. 	You should make it a rule to write to me at least once a week. You 	will feel light in your heart if you do so. Never entertain such 	futile thoughts that you could not write to me because you were 	unworthy. Should you on your own think yourself unworthy, or feel so 	only if I thought you unworthy? Will you try to curb my thoughts? If 	God thinks me worthy, why should I think myself to be unworthy? God 	never regards anyone as unworthy. How, then, could parents with feet 	of clay think their offspring unworthy? Are they themselves likely 	to be so perfect that they can claim the right to judge their 	offspring and 
 think them unworthy? No one is competent to judge who in this world is worthy and who is not. All of us being imperfect, we should bear with one another and do the best we can and purify ourselves. Parents have no right to sit in judgment over their offspring, nor  has  a husband the right to sit in judgment over his wife. This is implicit in ahimsa. Therefore overcome your sense of frustration and take heart.
 Blessings from

  MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF MYSORE 
 January 9, 1934
 I carry with me very pleasant recollections of my brief stay in the State. I hope the people of Mysore will keep up their reputation for being enlightened by removing untouchability root and branch.

  SPEECH  AT  PUBLIC  MEETING,  PALGHAT libtech_683_footnote 
 January 10, 1934
 Early in the morning, I entered Malabar—with due deference to our friends who call themselves sanatanists—the land of inequalities. As I was passing by familiar places the face of a solitary Nayadi, whom I had seen during the previous visit, rose before my eyes.libtech_684_footnotelibtech_685_footnoteIt was about ten or eleven in the morning when, in the midst of a discussion about untouchability, unapproachability and invisibility, all forms of which are found in no part of the world except in Malabar, a shrill voice was heard. Those who were talking to me said, ‘We can show you a live Nayadi.’ The public road was not for him. Unshod, he was walking across the fields with a noiseless tread. I went out with the friends and saw the Nayadi. I asked him to come and talk to me. Evidently he was frightened and he did not know when a blow would descend upon him. Trembling he talked to me. I told him that the public road was a much for him as for me. He said, ‘It cannot be so. I
 
 may not walk on the public road’. I close that scene and ask the sanatanists or anybody else to show me the authority in defence of this inhuman conduct. You will find me smiling with you, laughing with you, and cracking jokes with you, but you may also know that behind all those jokes and smiles and laughs, the face of the Nayadi and that scene will keep haunting me throughout my tour in Malabar.
 As I was coming here, I was greeted by black flag demonstrators mixed with national flag demonstrators. I tell you that I appreciated the black flag demonstrators more than the national flag demons- trators because I could see untruth in its nakedness behind the black flag. What if those who had black flags had smeared themselves as Brahmins do ? He is no Brahmin merely because he carries a black flag or red flag and has marks on his forehead. Brahminhood is not known by external marks. The scriptures I swear by and in whose defence I would love to die tell me that he alone is a Brahmin who knows Brahman. Brahminhood is the essence of humanity, self- effacement, pity. All those
 virtues which our ancestors have taught us to prize have to incarnate themselves in a Brahmin. He is a Brahmin who is a living treasure of scriptures, but not he who makes a demonstration of untruth by carrying a black flag.
 I have come to Malabar to speak out of the very depths of my soul. There are many things in Malabar over which, as you know, I have gone into raptures. You have scenery which is second to none in the world. Man, if he behaves himself, can live an easy life in Malabar. Woman in Malabar is the freest in India. All the women I have seen in Malabar have a majesty which has always commanded my respect. As you know, I had the pleasure of meeting the ex-Maharani of Travancore. Her simplicity commanded my admiration and at first sight I fell in love with her. But there is nothing to be proud of in the Malabar untouchability. It is the vilest thing on earth. I want you to wipe out this shame of untouchability from Malabar; and if you can do it, the whole of India naturally will follow; and you can do it if you will. I have entered Malabar in high hopes. It is for you to fulfil it or frustrate it. Only write down this prophecy in your hearts that, if untouchability as we practise it today lives, Hinduism perishes. I ask you to believe in what I am saying and to save Hinduism from impending doom. You have the opportunity of making your choice. Make it now or never.

  SPEECH  AT  WOMEN’S  MEETING,  PALGHATlibtech_686_footnote 
 January 10, 1934
 Do you know why I have come here ? I have come here to ask you to do penance. I have come here to ask you to forget that there can be a single human being who can be called ‘untouchable’. You, the women of Malabar, are freer than any women in any other part of India. And if you choose to, you can save Hinduism from peril. Even if millions of people came and said that untouchability was a divine institution, I will repeat it is an institution of the devil. I have just now come from a little settlement where I saw Nayadi brethren and some sisters. It  is   your shame and my shame that they have got to live on  a little rice  thrown  at  them  from  a  distance.  I  have  nothing more to say to you. And if you want to commence by doing penance, then you will commence by discarding your ornaments and silver to contribute funds to help these helpless human beings.

  SPEECH AT MEETING OF NAYADIS, KUZHALMANNAM 
 January 10, 1934
 Well, I have received this address, which I suppose you have not read. Therefore whatever is written in the address will have very little value and this I regard as a breach of truth. As a matter of fact, if you would have read this address to me in Malayalam, then I might have known that you represented your own feelings and it would have some educative value. Also, your lot was not unknown to me. I have just now come to Malabar, as I am touring in other parts of India for one purpose only, namely, to abolish distinction between Nayadis and non-Nayadis. There is no sin as great as unapproachability or untouchability. So long as Harijans are crushed by that devil called untouchability, we have to work to crush that devil. I want that untouchability must be wiped out of Hinduism, or Hinduism would perish. I would like you to take part in the movement for purification in the best manner possible, taking advantage of every other facility that might be offered, in the way of education, to your children and yourself. If you are given to the habit of drinking, you must give it
 
 up; if you do not observe the simple laws of hygiene  you  must observe them. You must also observe sanitation and must be clean both externally and internally.

  SPEECH AT WOMEN’S MEETING, GURUVAYUR 
 January 10, 1934
 FRIENDS,
 I thank you for the address presented to me and the purse. This is the first place in Malabar where an address has been presented by women. By that if you mean that you represent the women of the taluk, then it means that men have no addresses to present to me. It may be that you are not touched by the spirit of self-purification. I see that the women of Malabar have not summoned sufficient strength to present an address both on behalf of men and women. The women must lead the battle against untouchability. In point of education, Malabar women are much more advanced than their sisters in other presidencies. I want you to turn this to the best possible advantage. When I put to auction articles presented to me I hope that women would put to shame men by taking them for higher prices. I can point out that you can commence this today by offering one bangle, necklace, etc. But you are smiling or laughing. I take it seriously. Women in less advanced parts of India like Madras and Andhra commenced to bid by offering two or three bangles. I shall be presently putting the women’s spirit to rest as soon as I finish a few remarks. I want to tell the sisters who have gathered here that after I entered into Malabar this morning I have been considering what special message I can deliver, because Malabar shows this disease of untouchability in a most aggravated form.
 I feel that if the women of Malabar determine to work for this cause with redoubled energy, this devil can be wiped out. In others parts of the world, women won their rights by making sacrifices and suffering. But for Malabar women it should be a double speciality, and that for the simple reason that the women of Malabar occupy in India a most unique position. Therefore, if the women of Malabar led a battle against the devil of untouchability, it would be wiped out soon. It is only in Malabar, I discovered on entering, that they are dressed in spotless white garments. It is only of late that the fashion has grown among women of wearing variegated colour garments. Yet, I have noticed that colours are not so much loved in these parts as one
 
 would find in other parts of India. I do not know the secret of your domestic life. But I have flattered myself with the belief that this white garment of women of Malabar represents their internal purity. I hope that my belief would be well-placed if untouchability is removed root and branch in Malabar. I suppose, in point of education, the women of Malabar will carry the palm. What I want the women of Malabar to do is to save Hinduism from impending danger. I would like you to throw over board your laziness and indifference whatever it may be. I would like you to keep watch very vigilantly as you would do over babies. You will treat your babies with affection. It is not so with your religion. The more vigilant you are, the more scientifically precise you would be. Before you, the women of Malabar, lies a mission. Will you try to abolish the distinction between high and low ? Believe  me, those whom we are considering as lower than ourselves are not lower in the estimation of God. The prevalence of untouchability is due to insolence which leads to devilish interpretation of religious books. I have never been in the habit of using exaggerated language and if I may seem to be using strong language, I feel that this con- viction of mine is a very fundamental one. What I have stated in addressing women applies to men also. You are not free from dis- belief. Religion requires more men and women to guard it. To put it briefly, the present movement stands for self-purification.

  LETTER TO YVONNE PRIVAT 
 AS   AT  WARDHA, C.P.
 January 11, 1934
 MY DEAR BHAKTI,
 It is just 3.20 a. m. and I have finished reading your letter undated. Women will not think of dates! They work for eternity and therefore they disregard human divisions of time!
 Your accusation is, from your point of view, justified. We have been rushing at such a speed that it has become impossible to keep pace with the correspondence. Your letter (previous) is lying with me somewhere but I had no time.Today for very shame I take your letter first in order that it may not go into a bottomless file. Though neither Mira nor I have written to you for some time, you are ever before the mind’s eye. Your inseparableness, your ever genial faces and your
 readiness for sacrifice—these and many such things are a perpetual reminder to me of the times we had together.
 I know you are doing good work there. I did read about the church people’s revolt against Hitler.
 I expect to hear more about the result of Ceresole’slibtech_687_footnotevisit  to Germany. Do please give my love to him.
 I am surprised to learn that you are not getting Harijan regu- larly. I am writing to the Editor at once.
I hope both of you are prospering in every sense of the term.
 I say nothing about me, as you will learn all about me from
 Harijan.
With our love to both of you.

      FRIENDS,  January 	11, 1934 
 I 	would like you all to give me perfect silence.libtech_689_footnote  	We have here a forcible illustration of the age-old truth that ‘Man 	proposes but God disposes’. I had hoped to be able to speak to you 	on subjects of the greatest importance to you, to me and to the 	whole of the Hindu world. Instead of being able to do that, I have 	been obliged to devote precious forty minutes to a scene that I 	witnessed this morning.libtech_690_footnoteI found two fellow countrymen lying here, stretched on 	the platform, one of them bleeding through the mouth and both of 	them apparently senseless. The first thing, therefore, that       
 fell to me to do was to give the best attention that was possible for me to these fellow countrymen. And so they have been sent under the charge of Prof. Malkani to the dispensary here for medical attention. In so far as a lay nurse like me can judge, I do not think that their lives are in any way in danger. And let us all pray that they may soon be up and doing.
 I understand from the two other friends who have come here on behalf of the All-India Varnashrama Swarajya Sangh that they had all come here on behalf on this Sangh. They had as perfect a right to attend this meeting as any single one of you. They had a perfect right to stage a hostile demonstration, if they intended to, on a peaceful footing. However repugnant it might appear to me that those who represent sanatan dharma should resort to such demonstration, I perfectly recognized their right to make such a demonstration yester- day at Palghat, and I had no hesitation in making public refe-rence at the meeting there to their demonstration more than to the demonstration of those who had come to greet me out of affection for me and sympathy for the cause. And I gave then and there the reason for my saying that I appreciated this black flag demonstration more than the demonstration of affection. I must not repeat the reason here, but I must refer you to the public speechlibtech_691_footnotelibtech_692_footnote, if at all it finds publication in any of the local journals. Here I want only to say that it was a matter of deep grief to me to find that these two countrymen were hurt, no matter for what cause, no matter by whom. If any single volunteer or any single person connected with the organization of this meeting had any hand in assaulting these friends, I have no hesitation in saying that he has disgraced the cause and has hurt Hinduism, which he thought he was serving.
 I have said repeatedly that this cause of Hinduism can only be served by men and women who are above suspicion and who have a character to keep and to lose. In a movement of self-purification there is no room for a hasty word, for a hasty action, for abuse, certainly not for bodily harm. And if there are any persons here present who were instrumental in causing hurt to these countrymen of ours, whose lives should be as dear to you and to me as our own blood relations’, then I invite them to purge themselves of that guilt by making a public declaration of their having done this injury and taking the pledge never to repeat such a dishonourable act.
 
 Keenly and deeply as I feel the taint of untouchability and deeply as I feel convinced that, if this untouchability is not removed root and branch from Hinduism, Hinduism is bound to perish, I would not have untouchability removed by force or show of force or compulsion of any kind whatsoever. Removal of untouchability is not  a matter of law or of compulsion. Removal of untouchability is a matter of change of heart, perfect purification on the part of millions of Hindus. And that can only be brought about by the sacrifice of thousands of workers themselves, and not by causing injury to other people. Hence has every scripture that I have read pronounced from the house-tops that religion can only be defended by tapascharya. I will, therefore, beseech every one of you, who crowd round me wherever I go, to remember that this movement is a movement of personal, individual self-purification and self-conviction. And if you cannot approach this question from that point of view, I would far rather that I was deserted by you and that all the meetings were deserted by you. And if any man or woman is eager to come and listen to me or to give me an ounce of milk, he or she should do so, provided he or she has got that complete identification with the cause and a perfect spirit of self-purification.
 Having said this and having made this declaration of my faith under the shadow of the great temple of Guruvayur, I would like to make this appeal from the bottom of my heart to those who are organizing the activities of the Varnashrama Swarajya Sangh, and kindred bodies also, to understand that they will not defend what they call sanatan dharma by staging demonstrations of the character that they have been doing. They sent a body of men throughout the tour in C. P. who wanted to fall prostrate before the car and impede my progress at every stage. There were often clashes between volunteers who were looking after me and this body of six or seven young men. Fortunately, no serious or untoward event happened, though scratches certainly were inflicted on either side even during the C. P. tour, I quickly made friends with those people who were staging those obstructive demonstrations and told them as earnestly as I could that that  was  not  the  way  to   protect   Hinduism.libtech_693_footnoteSome   of   them   were youngsters who did not even know what they were doing. With the exception of one, I doubt if any of them had any idea of the elements of Hinduism. And I had hoped here also that, if there were such men
 
 who wanted to stage demonstrations, I should come in touch with them, discuss with them, understand them and know who they were. But I was sorry that hardly had I put my foot in Malabar when I was faced with the scene that I witnessed here. It would have been better if  I had been able to make their acquaintance before and ascertained what they wanted to do. But they chose to take a different course. I still invite them to meet me and tell me what they would exactly want me to do; and, short of stopping this tour, I would make every facility for them, and every convenience for them to express their thoughts or even to make whatever peaceful demonstrations that they might want to stage. But what I am most anxious to avoid is goondaism in every shape and form on the part of either party. I give the same credit to  those who call themselves sanatanists for honesty of purpose that I would claim for myself, but both must have an equal right to give expression to their views and mould
 public opinion. After all, sanatan dharm is not the prerogative of one set of people. I claim myself to be a representative of sanatan dharma in every sense of the term that they claim. I base my vehement oppo-sition to untouchability upon the same Shastras by which they swear, and I should stand by my interpretation of the Shastras even though I were the solitary one amongst the millions of Hindus; because the same Shastras tell me that I may not resist the inner call of my fundamental being. Thank God, however, that I do not stand alone in the interpretation that I have been placing before you. On the contrary, there are learned shastris who have just as much right to interpret the Shastras as those who call themselves the exponents of sanatan dharma. And they give precisely the same interpretation that I have placed before tens of thousands of men and women. And it is my settled conviction, based upon an unbroken experience extending over a period of nearly fifty years, that untouchability as we practise it today has absolutely no warrant whatsoever in the Hindu Shastras. I claim that Harijans have precisely the same common rights of worship, of use of public institutions and in all other walks of life that the tallest of Hindus enjoy in common with the rest of Hindu mankind. And, therefore, I have not the shadow of a doubt that caste Hindu will not have performed their elementary duties by Harijans until they have thrown open the gates of Guruvayur and such ancient temples to the Harijans, precisely on the same terms on which they are open to other Hindus.
But I have infinite patience; and, as you know, although
 Kelappan’s fast had progressed for many days, although many of these reformers were actually in the temple threatening to declare a sym-pathetic fast with Kelappan and although the reformers thought that the prize was almost within their grasp, I sent a peremptory tele- gramlibtech_694_footnotelibtech_695_footnotefrom my own fasting bed, calling upon Kelappan to suspend the fast and to withdraw the men who were inside the Guruvayur temple. And I did so because I felt that the fast was premature and I smelt coercion in it. I mention this in order to show that I will not be guilty of being party to the opening of a single temple under coercion. But I do want temples to be opened where public opinion is absolutely and clearly ripe for the opening of those temples. If there is any legal obstruction in the process, I want that legal obstruction to be removed. That is the meaning, and the only meaning, of the Temple-entry Bill, and no other. This Bill simply removes the power- lessness that many trustees today feel about opening the temples under their charge because of the legal obstruction. There is not the slightest trace of compulsion or coercion about this Temple-entry Bill or the kindred Bill called the Anti-untouchability Bill.
 But I heard a whisper this morning that behind this temple-entry agitation there is a nefarious design, if not on my part, on the part of my co-workers, that we should take possession of these temples and own them. I have no hesitation whatsoever in categorically denying this statement. I have certainly no such design whatsoever, and I do not know of a single co-worker who has any such design. And if there is any such co-worker who has such a design, he has no place whatsoever on this platform. The possession will remain undoubtedly in the hands of those who are today lawfully in possession.
 A kindred question that was asked was whether behind this there was also a design to undermine Brahminism. I can only tell you that I cannot be guilty of any such design; for, to me to undermine Brahmi- nism is to undermine Hinduism. This does not mean endorsement of the claim that the Brahmins, so called, may put forth today. No man can be accepted as a Brahmin by society merely by reason of his birth. The Shastras themselves say that a born Brahmin who does not act according to the requirements of Brahminism will forfeit his right to be called a Brahmin by the people in general. There are Brahmins themselves today in this very movement who say that they cannot be called Brahmins unless they carry out the precepts of the Shastras
 
 referring to them. I believe that the Brahmin is the cornerstone of Hinduism, as of every other religion. But there you must understand the meaning of the word Brahmin. The Brahmin is the person who has realized Brahman. If he has not that realization in every act of his, he shows that he is ever after it and nothing else. Such a Brahmin demands my ten thousand prostrations every morning, but not the Brahmin who is dictated by self, who is multiplying himselflibtech_696_footnotelibtech_697_footnoteday after day and thinks mostly of himself, rarely of others, nor even the Brahmin who smears himself with ashes from top to toe and can punctiliously and correctly recite the Vedas. It may be necessary for him to smear himself with ashes. It is necessary for him to translate the Vedas in his own life. It is necessary for him to exhibit Brahman in every act of his life. It is necessary for him to be pure and to impart that purity to all his surroundings. It is necessary for him to be ever ready to die so that others may live. Now you understand what regard I have for the true Brahmin and Brahminism.
 Having heard this probably the writer of a printed letter which was placed in my hands this morning does not want replies to the several questions which he has put me and to which he has expected replies this morning. But I can say this much to him that, if he wants a detailed reply to everyone of the questions that he has raised here, he can get it by turning to the file of Harijan. He will there find also that, in putting the interpretations that he has put in his letter on several things, he has undoubtedly misread the message of the Gita and the message of Hinduism.
 Lastly he has asked for an interview with me. I am sorry that he cannot have it at Guruvayur, but he can have it at Calicut on the 16th instant at ten o’clock in the morning. I had an invitation for a discussion yesterday at Palghat with some learned pundits. I was sorry to have to disappoint them so far as Palghat was concerned, because, when I received their invitation, I was making preparations for leaving Palghat. But I have given them ten o’clock in the morning at Calicut on the 16th instant, and I would be glad to see this friend and any other friends who may wish to converse with me on every one of the points that I have discussed here and any other points that may arise in the course of that discussion. Though the 16th instant is supposed to be an off day, it is not a day of recreation for me. Therefore I was obliged to restrict the interview to half an hour in my letter to the
 
 pundits. But I propose now to devote one hour for that discussion, so that the pundits may have the whole half hour to themselves, if they chose to take it.libtech_698_footnotelibtech_699_footnoteI have   absolutely  nothing  to  withhold  from  any single person, nor have I the slightest desire to hide my ignorance. I have already set forth my limits. I do not profess to be a learned man in any sense of the term. I profess to be a humble seeker, ever ready and ever anxious to follow literally every precept of Hindu religion as  I know it. I, therefore, freely confess that, if the pundits or anybody else invited me to to a recital of the Vedas or an exposition of the Vedas and so on, they would floor me entirely. But they will not easily dislodge me from the position that I occupy. If a knowledge of God or if a knowledge of the fundamental precepts of Hinduism had depended upon a meticulous knowledge of all the Vedas and a forest of books, then hardly any person would be able to say, ‘I know something of God.’. But these scriptures say that to know God is possible for every single human being on earth if he purifies his heart.
 I must thank you sincerely for the silence with which you have listened to me. Now I want you to join me in prayer to God Almighty that He may direct our steps in the right direction and that He may give us the strength that is necessary to exorcize this devil of untouchability from our hearts.
 Lastly, please remember that those who believe that untouchability is an evil and who believe also that it can be exorcized only by self-purification should never hurt a single hair of those who are opposing this movement. On the contrary, you and I have to see to it that we win them over by our own correct conduct and by gentle persuasion. I, therefore, ask you to treat those two friends, who are now in the dispensary, and those who might be representing the Varnashrama Swarajya Sangh, with respect and affection and as your guests. Irrespective of what they may do, let them experience the warmth of your hospitality and affection and not your bitter reproach.

   SPEECH  AT  PATTAMBIlibtech_700_footnote  
 January 11, 1934
 It has given me some surprise that in Malabar, the  land  of  eternal green, you have to use artificial paper flowers. I thought that in Malabar, where Nature has been so beneficent to you, you could avoid all artificiality. But I suppose that in order to appreciate the beauty of this land you require the help of a person who comes from a treeless desert as I do. Just as you have gone in for artificiality in the matter of flowers, you go in for artificiality in the matter of untouchability, and then you think that that artificial product comes from Divinity itself. I have come to warn you against the belief that untouchability, unapproachability or invisibility can have any divine sanction. In my opinion it is one of the greatest sins that we, Hindus, have been committing against man and God. You degrade human beings, as we have been doing in this part of the world, and then to say that they are what they are because of their past deeds is a complete caricature of the law of karma. I claim to know somewhat, from first-hand evidence, of the working of the law of karma, because practically a period of fifty years I have devoted to find out what this law of karma could be. And this much I do know that to apply it to everybody else but ourselves is to distort it altogether; and if I had more time than I have at my disposal, I could show to the satisfaction of every one of you that you can never apply the law of karma as you apply it to the Nayadis and others. If we were to apply the law of karma as I have suggested, that is to say, towards ourselves, you would find the land here and elsewhere transformed. I have, therefore, come to beseech every one of you to exorcize this ghost of untouchability. If you do not, you may be sure that that ghost will eat us up.
 Harijan, 19-1-1934
 
   NOTES  
 FRIENDLY DISCUSSION ALWAYS WELCOME
 During my brief stay in Madras I saw in the papers that a public appeal signed by certain gentlemen was made to me. In it, I was asked to hold a public discussion about untouchability. Later on I received a printed copy of that appeal, with the following opening words typed at the top :
 
 As a man posing to know more, please come out and discuss. Don’t say, “No time, no time”. It is a shame to say so when your very existence is questioned. World will laugh at you and will mock at you.
 Then follows this astonishing paragraph :
 Abandoning all his political activities which had really brought him into the limelight of Indian politics, destroying—for all practical purposes— the great Indian National Congress which had made him its virtual dictator and blindly entrusted its destiny into his hands and agonizing not merely the orthodox sanatanadharmis but also all lovers of Indian nationalism in the land, Mr. Gandhi has, of late, begun a whirlwind propaganda against
 untouchability and in favour of temple-entry legislation, whereon he has been putting forth his ipse dixits and obiter dicta before the public, not as his own individual views or in the name of Rousseau, Tolstoy, Lenin, etc., but under the banner of sanatan dharma, sociology, abstract justice and so on!
 I had some such appeal again whilst I was travelling in Nellore District. The telegram inviting me to a discussion says :
 It appears to us that you have not understood the Hindu dharma and have been leading the Hindus astray from the path of true moral and religious life.
I  was not able to reply to these invitations there and then :  the
 last invitation was received at Venkatagirilibtech_701_footnotelibtech_702_footnoteat 10 o’clock at night. The next day I was to reach Tirupati, near which I was to go to the  proposed discussion. I had to be content with sending a  verbal  message to my host at Tirupati. As to the first invitation, I had sent the message that I was ready to hold a friendly discussion with anybody and to be convinced of my error, if it could be brought home to me. I had to say that my time was limited and that the discussion would only take place, at my decision, wherever it might be for the time being. My limitations I had set forth in these columns times without number :  I am no Sanskrit scholar, but I know sufficient to detect errors in translations that may be given to me. I claim to have read the Shastras to my satisfaction, and I claim to have endeavoured from my youth upwards to put into practice the fundamental precepts of the Shastras. Thus I have no hesitation in putting before the public, with the utmost confidence, the conclusions I have reached regarding certain fundamentals of Hinduism. One of the conclusions I have reached is
 
 
 that there is no warrant in the Shastras for untouchability as it is practised today. My conclusion is supported by shastris no  less learned than those who challenge my conclusion, and the former  claim to be just as good sanatanists as those who hold the opposite view, but I always believe in regarding opponents with respect and, therefore, listening to what they might have to say. I have held discussions with them more than once, and these have resulted in strengthening my convictions. Therefore, whilst I feel that myopinion will not be shaken by any such discussions, I am quite willing to find time for those who could be good enough to suit themselves to my daily engagements. I dare not disturb the programme that has been settled in advance for several months to come. I have already had discussions with sanatanists during the tour at several places. If those who write to me directly or indirectly through the Press will observe the laws of common courtesy and if they have the desire to find a basis for common work, I have no doubt that there are many points of agreement, even on the question of temple-entry and the proposed legislation. Much mis-understanding can be removed by mutual and friendly discussion. I may mention for the information of the general reader that, as against sanatanists who are enraged against me and fling all sorts of abuses at me, I frequently meet those who, having understood the central point of my message, have become supporters. I have no weapon with me except the one of an appeal to the reason and heart of the people. The reform that I am advocating can only come through a change of heart on the part of millions of Hindus. Therefore, it is in the interest of my mission that I lose not a single opportunity of meeting my opponent, whenever it is possible for me to do so.

   LETTER TO MANILAL AND SUSHILA GANDHI  
 January 13, 1934
 CHI. MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
 I got the letters from both of you. I hope you get my letters regularly. Of late I have not missed a single mail. With my last letter I had enclosed a copy of Ba’s letter.
 Sushila has given sufficiently detailed news about Shanti. If he does not waste money in fanciful ventures, I am satisfied.
 Sushila wishes to know who are in my party. I think I have already written about that. Chandrashankar, Mirabehn, Om, Kisanbehn (Premabehn’s friend), Professor Malkani (Thakkar Bapa’s represen- tative), two accountants—Vishwanath and Damodar—one store-keeper Sharma and one typist—these form the party.
 Personally I like Sita being talkative and mischievous. It is for the parents to put these qualities to good use. They can in this way impart a good deal of education. Naughtiness and talkativeness are a kind of energy, like steam. The energy of steam is conserved and used to drive big trains and steamboats. A child’s energy can be used in a similar manner. If we understand it and use it wisely, it can produce excellent results. Instead of making Sita write the letters of the alphabet, you should teach her just now to draw geometrical figures. After that you may teach her to draw pictures of objects and last of all to write the letters. But before doing that you should teach her to recognize the letters, and to understand the meaning of words. You can give her some knowledge daily through stories. You can easily teach her some-thing about history, geography, science and tell her
 
 
 stories from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. She can learn all these things in play. This will not tire you; on the contrary you will enjoy teaching her in this manner. Through this you yourself will learn something daily and Sita will get the best possible education. She can learn English, Gujarati and also Hindi at the same time. What help do you give to Manilal ?
 Did either of you see West ? Please meet him and give me some news of him. I shall be satisfied if he is not unhappy. You should show yourself always ready to help.
 Ba seems to be all right. This time she does not appear to enjoy as much freedom as before.
 I did not understand Pragji’s letter to you. I do not remember in what context we had the talk and what I had said. In any case, what I may have said does not apply to you two. The facts are not the same in all cases. We may have dicussed what his duty was in India. It is of course true in a sense that, if the struggle here succeeds, the solution of the problem in that country will soon follow. But that certainly does not mean that anybody should leave that country and come away to India. The rule that ‘better is death in the discharge of one’s duty’libtech_704_footnoteis perfectly true in this case. You two, therefore, should go on doing the work which is your dharma at present. It will be enough if you do not depart from the path of dharma in doing that work.
 Devdas has been released. He will spend his time in Delhi and other places for the present. He will come and see me. He has kept good health. He paid a visit to Kanti. The latter has displayed bound- less courage. He doesn’t leave jail at all. Let us see how long he keeps it up.
 Kishorelal can be said to be a little better. The fever has not yet wholly left him.
 Write to Devdas and Lakshmi. And continue to write to Ramdas and Nimu regularly. I hope you are getting Harijan.

   LETTER TO DAHYABHAI PATEL  
 January 13, 1934
 CHI. DAHYABHAI,
 I have your letter. I got three letters  almost  simultaneously which may be regarded as an instance of telepathy.
 Mahadev is being tested severely. Possibly he might suffer a little loss of health, though no other hardship. I have sent a detailed message in reply to the letter to Jivanji. However, the next time you have a chance write as follows :libtech_705_footnote
 “Whilst I need not receive Mahadev’s letters, he must not think that I cannot have time to read them. The Gita portion was technical and I felt that there was no immediate need for me  to  give  my opinion. And the fact is that I have so little regard for my own technical meaning of the verses. Where the meaning does not fit in with my interpretation as a whole, I should naturally have to examine it but speaking in general terms one meaning would be to me as good as any other and therefore I should readily accept Mahadev’s considered interpretation in preference to my own which after all must have been an adoption of some single author’s version. He should therefore prosecute his researches and his work of translation without waiting for my opinion. When it is all completed of course I shall have ample time, God willing, to go through it.
 I take it that Mahadev has read B. Shaw’s Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God. I am sending  him  today, Adventures of the White Girl in Her Search for God by Cff. Maxwell. If he gets it safely, he will acknowledge it in his next letter.
When I reach Belgaum I shall try to see Mani and Mahadev.
 Blessings from

   SPEECH  AT  PUBLIC  MEETING,  TELLICHERRYlibtech_706_footnote  
 January 13, 1934
 FRIENDS,
 I am very much obliged to you for the addresses and the purse you have presented to me. You know the nature of the mission at the present moment taking me from one end of India to the other. In pursuance of that mission early this morning I have come here to ask you to rid yourselves of the devil of untouchability from your hearts.  I see in all your addresses there is one note running, namely, that this monster of untouchability might be laid low. Let us not make the mistake of supposing that this is a work that has got to be done by somebody else. It is essentially a work that has got to be done by everybody—by himself or herself—for it is a matter essentially of a change of heart on the part of the caste Hindus or savarna Hindus as they are called. They have to cease to think that they are caste Hindus or that some of them are savarnas and others avarnas. This distinction of high and low has destroyed society altogether and as we want to save ourselves from impending destruction, we must cease to think that anybody on earth is lower than ourselves. The poison of untouchability has spread so far and so wide that even amongst caste and caste there is a grave degree of untouchabilty. In this distinction of high and low, we have gone further, and the poison has enveloped all the communities. There is untouc-hability not merely amongst Hindus and Hindus, savarnas and avarnas, savarnas and savarnas, but there is untouchability also between Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, and Christians. I am convinced that, whilst there may be other reasons for inter-communal quarrels, I have no doubt whatsoever that untouc- hability is the main and deciding reason for the majority of these quarrels. Therefore, if we will exorcize this principal manifestation of the devil of untouchability, I have not even a shadow of doubt that we will be able to right the wrong all along the line. One  of  your addresses mentions that most of the temples are not open to Harijans and that only one temple, opened by the followers of Shri Narayana Guru, is open to Harijans. I congratula te the trustees of the temple on their liberality and I hope that their example will be followed by other trustees; but it will largely depend upon the temple-going public to bring about that change. If the temple goers are sincerely penitent
 
 and feel that hitherto they have done serious wrongs to Harijans by prohibiting them from entering the temples, I have no doubt that their expression of opinion cannot be challenged and the temples will be soon opened. I am therefore hoping that you will organize public opinion so that the temples may soon be opened to Harijans precisely on the same terms as they are open to other Hindus. I am surprised to discover that there was in some place near here bad blood between untouchables and untouchables, that is between Pulayas and Thiyyas. I do hope that the Harijans all over will set their house in order and rid themselves of untouchability within untouchability. Now you have given me this purse which I only consider as a token of your determination to deal with this evil in a final manner.

         FRIENDS,    SPEECH  AT  PUBLIC  MEETING,  MAHElibtech_707_footnote    January 	13, 1934 
  	I have a peculiar pleasure in being in your midst since you are in a 	part of French India. I had the pleasure of visiting Chandanagore in 	Bengal more than once. But this is my first visit to French India in 	this part of the country. For me whether it is French India or 	British India it is one and  the  same  country.  The  same  blood  	flows through my veins that goes through yours, the same soil, the 	same atmosphere, the same manners and customs and many things too 	numerous to mention are common to all  of  us.  But  for  the 	difference in the uniform of your police and the French language I 	read here and there I would notice no difference  whatsoever.  	Therefore it is a matter of no surprise to me that you have, whilst 	I am passing through Malabar, invited me and presented me with a 	purse for the Harijan cause. Indeed I would have been surprised, and 	painfully surprised, if I had found that, whilst I was actually 	passing through this road, you took no notice whatsoever of the 	self-styled representative of the Harijans. Therefore I am glad to 	be able to be present in your midst even though it is only for a few 	minutes. I was glad to discover that an important temple in this 	place was thrown open to Harijans precisely on the same terms as to 	other Hindus. I    
 congratulate the trustees on having performed this very  simple religious duty. Now, I hope you know what I am after in pursuing this mission. I would like you to understand that mere opening of temples, mere opening of schools for Harijans does not constitute the whole of my mission. It means that savarna Hindus have got to purify their hearts and, make due reparations to the Harijans whom they have hitherto suppressed. It means that we should abolish all distinctions of high and low and realize that we are children of one country and as such, should realize that, being children of one country, there can be no distinction of high and low. May God help us to realize this very simple idea. I am glad of this Hindi address and I would like every one of you here to appreciate this message of Hindi.

   SPEECH AT OPENING OF DISPENSARY, PAKKANARPURAM  
 January 13, 1934
 I have been invited to open the dispensary that you see in front of you in the name of a young brave worker who sacrificed himself for the sake of his country and died some years ago in about 1921. His name is Balakrishna Menon. And this dispensary will be called after his name. In those days of non-co-operation at its height, he, in common with others, was confined in jail and it is in his memory that this dispensary is to be named. Medical relief has been given to hundreds of Harijans. Within the last four or five months over two thousand patients have been treated free of charge. Let us hope that this dispensary will grow day after day, that is to say, it would be an instrument of ever-increasing service to ailing humanity. I understand that a young medical practioner has offered to give his services free of charge. Let us hope that such self-sacrificing young men will multiply in this land. We do need young medical men who have the requisite spirit of self-sacrifice and who will consent to live in villages. It is absolutely necessary that Harijans should receive medical aid. I know and I am  grieved  that there are medical practitioners in India who disgrace their profession by refusing to touch Harijans lest the touch might pollute them. Therefore, it fills me with joy whenever  I find a medical practitioner who is entirely free from those superstitions and at the same time has the spirit of sacrifice to enable him to give his services free of charge. Whilst giving medical relief, providing  for  education  and  arranging  for  free   water   supply  are
 necessary in the interests of Harijans, there is something still more necessary to be done by the savarna Hindus. We have to cease to be patrons. We have been oppressing the Harijans for centuries. We have to purify ourselves from this taint of untouchability immediately and take the Harijans to our bosom. We have to consider them as our blood-brothers and sisters. It is a sin to consider any single human being to be lower than ourselves. It is blasphemy to consider that God can have any partiality with regard to His children. I would consider this dispensary a success if it lends itself to eradicate the distinction of high and low to some extent.

   SPEECH AT WOMEN’S MEETING, CALICUT  
 January 13, 1934
 DEAR SISTERS,
 I see that all of you are seized with a peculiar fear lest I might induce you and you might feel irresistibly tempted to part with all your ornaments. Some of you have already begun to give your trinkets. I propose to give you tonight a beautiful story of a girl called Kaumudi. I saw her for the first time this morning at Badagara and in response to an appeal I made to the ladies to give their jewellery, and, if they had the desire, all their jewellery, this little girl Kaumudi—I call her “little” comparatively—I suppose she was about 20 years, probably 21libtech_708_footnotelibtech_709_footnote—and she came forward and began with her two beauti- ful bangles, the only bangles she had on her wrists.
 I was more than satisfied but not she. Out she came with her very beautiful necklace. I thought she would stop at that. But she would not. Her hands involuntarily went to her ears and she suddenly thought there was something in her ears also, and was delighted to give her ear-rings. I was very deeply touched,but I suprressed my emotion at that time. Istraightaway enquired whether she was an independent girl or whether she had obtained the consent of  her father. And I immediately learnt that she had done this in the presence of her father because he was on the platform helping me to get my addresses and other trinkets. I then learnt that the father was also entirely with his girl in her giving everything that was on her person to
 
 the Harijan cause. All she wanted was an autograph for her two bangles. Of course I gave her more than my autograph. I wrote there in Hindi that her great sacrifice would be a truer ornament than her gold and jewel things. She went very delighted. And I had her definite promise that she was not going to ask her father to replace those articles of jewellery. She has enough and more articles to wear and jewellery also. Of course for a Malabar girl this is not an amazing performance. Because so far as my knowledge goes, Malabar girls are the simplest of all the girls in the world. Somehow or other they have left on my mind the impression that they have the least desire for jewellery. I may be wholly mistaken. Anyway that is the impression that they have left on my mind.
 I must conclude this soul-stirring story by adding another story. Now nearly ten years agolibtech_710_footnoteor more there was a girl in Andhradesha who was married and when I made an appeal to the sisters there—it was an imposing meeting of women in a theatre—she was the first to give me her ornaments. Although Sri Annapurnamma’s jewels wer comparatively simple, still her necklace or her chain as I might call it was a long heavy chain of pure gold. I must not describe other articles of her jewellery. Alas, she is no more. But let me inform you that she was true to her promise cent percent that she would not replace those rich articles of jewellery. She had very rich parents, who would gladly have given her all their jewellery to replace hers. But from that time up to the time of  her death which took place now three years agolibtech_711_footnotelibtech_712_footnoteshe never wore an article of jewellery. It is my certain conviction that Annapurnamma gained by giving and so has Kaumudi.  I  have lingered on those two very sacred illustrations and I want to tell you that in discarding your jewellery for a cause so sacred as the Harijan cause you will be doing nothing wonderful. [Women have done such things] when they have taken up  the  defence  of  a  sacred  cause  like this. I have to ask you, to beseech you, to purify your hearts of the sin of untouchability, to treat Harijan boys and girls as if they are your own children, brothers and sisters. We have for long ages supressed Harijans and today if we sacrifice our all for their sake we shall be only making some slight and tardy reparation for all the wrongs inflicted upon them in the name of religion. Therefore, whatever you give, whether it is a trinket or heavy piece of jewellery or
 
 silver, I want you to give as merely a token of your determination to rid yourselves of this taint of untouchability, the idea that you are high and somebody else is low. May God give you wisdom to see this very simple truth and enforce it in your life. Now you can give the things, whether jewellery, or silver or paper, whatever you want to give.

 458 SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, CALICUTlibtech_713_footnote
 January 13, 1934
 I am much obliged to you for these addresses that have been presented to me this evening and I thank you for the self-restraint you have imposed upon yourselves by not desiring to read these addresses to me. Only you have thereby appreciated the fact that I have been going from one place to another from day to day, now for over two months, and at the end of the day I am therefore fatigued. You, wise men that you are, have appreciated this act and absolved me from the duty of having to listen to these addresses. You having exercised this self-restraint, naturally it was up to me to read those addresses and be prepared. But I must say to you that I had no notion whatsoever that I was to have all these addresses nor have I been given copies of these addresses. Had I been given copies I would certainly have read them. However I have no doubt whatsoever that these addresses contain nothing more than what I have noticed in the numerous addresses that  I have been receiving throughout these two months or more. Almost without exception they have expressed to me great joy, not only their sympathy with the cause that I am espousing for the time being but they have in these addresses signified their intention, nay their deter- mination, of doing everythingthat these various bodies of gentlemen or ladies could possibly do in their own sphere to advance  the Harijan’s cause.
 It has given me a great deal of satisfaction and joy to discover that there is consensus of opinion on the part of the intelligentsia. I would have been painfully surprised if it had been otherwise. Not only has it been so with reference to the intelligentsia but as far as mere assent goes, I have found to my great delight the masses also are
 
 
 equally with this movement. I am not easily self-deluded. I have no doubt that I have, must have, my due share of self-delusion or else life perhaps would be a positive burden to most of us if not to all of us. But due allowance having been made for self-delusion I can say that all these scenes that I witness every day cannot possibly be a matter of masses or classes coming to me to signify their praise or their satisfaction for services that I might have performed in a previous life or in days gone by. This life has rushed and with me it has rushed with such rapidity that it is impossible for me to have a clear photography of the events that have happened and, that being the case, I should be intensely surprised and also disappointed that these classes and masses had signified not only their satisfaction and their sympathy by their presence at these meetings but also given me donations more or less and had done certain acts also as  a consideration for those services. I would let that pass by. I  am assuming that all your addresses contain a serious and solemn pledge that you are determined to do everything that is humanly possible for you to do to render the reparation that is overdue to the Harijans. Malabar, if one were to draw the untouchability map of the whole of India, I suppose will easily wear the black crown and Malabar would be the blackest spot so far as untouchability is concerned. It is a matter of regret but it is no use ignoring the fact. I would turn this blackness to good account and I would invite you to gird up your loins and make such Heruclean effort that at the end of the struggle it may be possible to say of Malabar that Malabar had been in the vanguard of progress in this battle against the monster of untouc- hability. Let it be said of Malabar that Malabar counted no sacrifices too great for removing this evil of untouchability. And what could be a better and more sacred reminder for this meeting than the portrait of Mr. K. Madhavan Nair ?
 I had the pleasure of knowing him long ago. When I first visited Calicut I had the honour of being introduced to him but I must confess that I did not know him so intimately as I came to know him when he paid me a visit at Yeravda. I then came into very intimate touch with him, and when Mr. C. Rajagopalachariar was here and the Guruvayur referendum was going on, naturally I was corresponding with him as with other friends almost from day to day. Then Smt. Urmila Devi and my wife came into close contact with Mr. K. Madhavan Nair. My wife is a simple woman. She knows nothing, she does not know the English language, certainly she does not know Malayalam, but she was able to tell me in her very simple language
 that she was very much struck by the simplicity of his character. She merely strengthened the impression that Mr. Madhavan had left on my mind and that impression is still indelible. I have the most vivid re- collection of my contact with him and what struck me most was his transparent humility. This is his faithful picture and I congratulate the artist on presenting the citizens of Calicut with this picture. I think there you can easily see humility written in his features. I don’t think that the artist has enhanced the transparence of his humility. I think the artist is incapable of doing that. To look at Mr. Madhavan Nair and look at the living eye would give you a better illustration of that humility. The whole of his behaviour is on the picture. Mr. Madhavan Nair is in front of me today as I saw him in Yeravda. He stands vividly before me and this is the one peculiar impression that he left on me.
 I discovered also that he was a man of very few words. You do not find many people who are economical in the use of language or their words. In his contact with me Mr. Madhavan Nair showed this quality in a supreme degree. His letters were compact, nice, neat and the briefest possible. Whatever he had to say he expressed in a few words and he had finished. That was the man. If you were to recall the men who had died in body but are even now still living, you will discover that they are living not because of their intellectual gifts but because of virtues which you and I and every one of us can cultivate if we have the will and if we will make the necessary effort in order to cultivate them. Therefore I would say you will be doing wrong to the memory of the man whom I have described as I have known him, if you think that you have performed your duty by calling upon me to unveil his portrait and for having witnessed this ceremony and having heard a few words in praise of his memory; nay, you will be doing wrong. But you will be doing the right thing if you will treasure as a perpetual reminder to you that you also would like to be if not wholly at last some what like Mr. Madhavan Nair. At the end, to put a finishing touch, Mr. Madhavan Nair died in harness so far as the Harijan cause is concerned. He was a true co-worker in the Harijan cause which is a matter of self-purification, repentance and reparation.  I give you my evidence that Mr. Madhavan Nair, when he took up this cause, had the spirit in him, for every act that he did in connection with the Harijan cause was an act of sacrifice, repentance and reparation. There was no meanness about anything that he did. May his memory ever remain in my heart and in your own hearts.
 I thank you once more for having presented me with addresses. Since I think that this is not proper time for auctioning these
 
 addresses, I hope that tomorrow you will help me to realize some money from these addresses because I know that Calicut will not send me away with disappointment.libtech_714_footnote

  SPEECH AT MALABAR CHRISTIAN COLLEGE, CALICUT 
 January, 13, 1934
 It was a great joy to me when I received the invitation to come to you to receive a purse for the Harijan cause and to speak a few words to you. You have naturally expressed your sympathy with the cause. But you boys ought not to be satisfied with the certificate that your Principal has given to the institution and therefore by implication to you also.libtech_715_footnotelibtech_716_footnoteYou are called upon to do something much more vital, to regard untouchability not as an institution descended to us from Divinity but as an institution which has been devised by the devil himself for encompassing our undoing. We, all of us, no matter to what faith we may belong, are children of the same Creator. There is but one Creator. We do say that with our lips, but we deny that profession in every walk of life and in so many of our activities. That lie we ought to get rid of from our lives. And who can do this better than the students? You must therefore make the announcement fearlessly that if we are children of the same God, then we are all equal. Do not in your mind cross-examine and say, ‘How can we be equal ?’ Some of you are very bright boys, and have received prizes and occupy front ranks in the classes, and how can those who are at the top of the class be on a par with those who are at the bottom of the class ? This is a fine conundrum for you and me and you ought to solve it wisely and not unwisely. Very often we solve these puzzles as we solve puzzles in arithmetic and geometry. If you are able to solve
 
 these wisely, then I will give you illustrations of earthly parents. Those of you who have brothers will realize that all have not the same degree of intelligence and of virtues. You are not certainly of the same age. You do not enjoy the same vigorous constitution. And yet do you find your parents distinguishing between you and those who are brighter and more diligent ? On the contrary perhaps your parents will give more to those who are helpless and are in need of help than to those who are brighter and well able to take care of themselves. Do you suppose then that the Divine Father, the Father of all fathers that the world has ever seen, will treat some from their very birth to be untouchables and therefore the lowest and others to be the highest at the top of ladder ? I suppose this is a self-proved proposition of untouchability as you are practising it today. The purse will be turned to good account if it is given as an earnest of your determination to change your hearts and to regard no person as untouchable on the face of the earth. Religion teaches us to consider ourselves as the lowest and everybody else as the highest. Do all of you behave like that ? Untouchability has undoubtedly to go. It is eating into the very vitals of our being and it crushes the very soul. If you are able to understand my words then you will so change your hearts and transform them that you will not allow untouchability in any shape or form to find a residence in your hearts. You will not allow untouchability towards boys belonging to other religions. You will go to Harijan quarters, instead of wasting your time, you will go there, serve the Harijan boys, and find out what their wants are. If your parents give you five pies or whatever it is, you must at least spare a portion of that money for the Harijan boys who are in greater need than yourselves. You will give your leisure minutes for the service of Harijan boys and girls. You will go to their quarters and sweep them. You must teach them how to lead a clean life. It is not enough that you clean your body but you must clean your heart and soul. The first thing to do, when you get up from bed, is to ask God to keep you clean in heart and body. If you will do these things, the purse that you have given is a token of your determination to get rid of untouc- hability.

  LETTER TO G. D. BIRLA 
 January 14, 1934
 BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
 Malkani has shown me your letter. I have written frankly to Biharilal. I send you a copy of my letter. We have to be outspoken and firm in our dealings with him. It does not seem possible in this tour to achieve all that can be accomplished in a walking tour. But whatever has been achieved appears to be good enough. Public opinion has undergone a great change but not much change is evident in the conduct. Let us see what happens. I can see only God’s hand in this work. This is not a trite observation. This task is beyond the power of one lone person or even of thousands. Nothing more can be written or said on this subject. It simply means that my faith in God is grow- ing stronger than ever. I am having a direct experience of the feeble- ness of my own powers.
I hope you are maintaining good health.

         FRIENDS,   SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, KALPETTAlibtech_717_footnote   January 	14, 1934 
  	It was not a task to me but a real pleasure to be able to drive 	through  this  very   beautiful  tract   of   the   country.   I   	have   learnt a great deal  of  what  lies  at  the  back  of the  	addresses  to  which  you have just now listened. The deceased 	Subbiah Goundan, it seems, has left by his will all the landed 	propertylibtech_718_footnotelibtech_719_footnotehe ever possessed for the Harijan cause. It is a rare 	gift and a rather rich gift. A great burden rests upon the executors 	of the will and the Trustees in connection with this Trust. They 	cannot make of this colony the success that the testator must have 	desired it to become, unless they devote themselves heart and soul 	to the scheme which has to be worked under this bequest. Let me hope 	that the Trustees or the executors are worthy of the trust that has 	been reposed in them and that they will discharge the     
 trust to the entire satisfaction of the public. I deliberately say “the public” because the Trust becomes public property immediately it is devoted to public use. It is under this hope and with this assurance that  I gladly declare this colony open and wish it every success. The materials for the experiment or realization of the scheme are in front of us all. We have in front of us not one or two but many Harijan brothers. All of us witnessed the music and the dance that they gave us. It was not a matter of enjoyment or amusement for us but it ought to carry a deep lesson to us. I suppose all of you realized as I did at once that there was no music about their instrument nor was there any charm about the dance. But that was the only thing that they do in order to pass their idle hours. The responsibility for the want of music about their instrument and about their dance lies not upon their shoulders but upon your shoulders and my shoulders. We need not have gone into their dance or their music in order to understand their primitive nature. Their appearance, their dishevelled hair and everything about their person is sufficient to tell us how criminally neglectful we have been to our kith and kin. They wear the same loin cloth or the scarf from year’s end to year’s end, till it turns into rags. They rarely bathe and when they do bathe, you may take it from me that it will not be in specially clean water. Again the responsibility for this disgraceful state of affairs is yours and mine. And if I had the management of this colony I tell you I would straightaway invite these people to live in the colony, give them decent pay and insist upon their taking regular baths and transform them into presentable human beings. I suppose that is precisely what we would do, each one of us, if we discovered suddenly that nearby was our own blood-brother residing in  precisely  the  same  savage  condition   that   these brothers  of  ours  are  living  in.  And  if  that  happy  state  of things is brought about without any loss of time, you and Iwill have more than well spent our time here. This addresss almost concludes with these words “May your efforts be crowned with success.” Well, I can only say that my efforts can never be crowned with success unless your efforts are also crowned with success. For, my efforts merely consist in inviting all the savarna Hindus to change of heart by  serving Harijans in every way possible. Lastly I ask these Harijan brothers to respond to the call of self-purification.

 FRIENDS,
  SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, CALICUTlibtech_720_footnote 
 January 14, 1934
  	I have just got several purses on behalf of the citizens of Calicut 	which amount to Rs. 4,388-5-9. On the principle that you may not 	look a gift horse in the mouth I must in all courtesy thank you for 	the gifts that you have given on behalf of the Harijan cause. But as 	a self- chosen or self-appointed Harijan servant I must lodge my 	respectful protest against the leanness of the purses from the 	capital of Malabar. You will be surprised to learn that Bangalore, 	not the capital of Mysore, but the second city in Mysore, not as big 	as Malabar, produced much more than you have given this evening. And 	I am fully aware of the capacity of Calicut to give for the Harijan 	cause. But nothing is lost yet. You have got here many tempting 	things, and at the end of a few remarks that I want to make, it is 	open to you and perfectly possible for you to make up for the 	deficiency and what is today undoubtedly a lean purse can be turned 	by you into a fat purse.libtech_721_footnote  	As I have said from many a platform after entering Malabar, if there 	was a map of untouchability made for the whole of India, Malabar 	would be marked as the blackest spot in all the land; and as matters 	stand today, I suppose you will admit that you will have to plead 	guilty to the charge. Then if you are convinced of the sin of 	Malabar, as confessedly you are convinced by the very fact of your 	giving me this purse, you will admit that Malabar has to make the 	greatest reparation in order to rid itself of the greatest sin. It 	does not matter, and it ought not to matter, the least little bit 	that some of you who are monied men do not originally come from 	Malabar. Those who make their livelihood or their fortunes in 	Malabar should realize that every pie they get is tainted with this 	sin. Therefore, in the matter reparation and repentance, they stand 	exactly on the same footing as the original Malayalis.  	This morning they took me to a most beautiful bit of Malabar; they 	took me up the hills with the most romantic scenery. There I was 	taken to a village called Kalpetta, and I recalled a hymn—I think 	it was composed by Bishop Heber. But whether it was composed by him     
 or some other bishop, this is the line that I single out from that hymn for your edification. It is said that, as he was approaching this Western coast of India, involuntarily this line came to his lips, or to his pen : “Every prospect pleases, man alone is vile.”libtech_722_footnoteI have no doubt that he had not this black spot of untouchability in his mind when he wrote this line. The orthodox interpretation of this line is wholly different from the one that I put upon it. But poets can never be confined even in cages of their own construction. Poets write for eternity. Their words are charged with a meaning of which they have no conception when they utter or write them. Scented breezes come from plantations that Nature has designed for man in Malabar. But through untouchability he has violated Nature and thus become vile. We have endeavoured to disfigure God’s mightiest creation, namely, man. The soul of man presents a beauty never to be surpassed by any ravishing beauty of vegetation. But the so-called savarna Hindus or the so- called high class Hindus arrogated to themselves the right of suppr- essing a portion of Hindu humanity. They endeavoured, however, vainly, as we shall presently see in a few years, perhaps. But man has left no stone unturned to suppress, in the name of Divinity itself, the soul of man by putting thousands outside the pale of society.
 I will tell you what I saw today in Kalpetta in the midst of the ravishing beauty of vegetation. I saw wild specimens of humanity, with  a stinking odour. Please do not say hastily that that is why they are untouchables. I want you to think with me a little more deeply than possibly you are prepared to do and realize with me that for this indescribably painful scene you and I are responsible. These very men, in an hour’s time, if you desire, can be transformed into beings cleanly and outwardly as respectable as you and I may be. A little hot water, or soap, a little white khaddar, and you will immediately find that they are just as presentable as you and I are. Internally, God alone can be the judge between them and us. It is quite possible, in fact, in my opinion it is quite certain, that we are much more sinful or much viler than they can be. Our slates are sullied with writings not particularly creditable to us. Their slates have still to be written upon. Are you now surprised that, when I saw these countrymen of ours, I involuntarily said in my mind to the poet, ‘you were right in saying,
 
 What though the spicy breezes Blow soft o’er Ceylon’s isle, Though every prospect pleases, And only man is vile.
 “Every prospect pleases, man alone is vile”.’ Now, put your hand upon your heart and tell me whether, if you gave up all your wealth and all sisters discarded every article of jewellery of which they are possessed, would it be a sufficient reparation for the injuries that you have been partners in inflicting on these countrymen of ours ? I wish to suggest to you that you will be fit servants of Harijans when you have begun the act of reparation by discarding all your possessions for their sake. But I know that is an ideal state of things, and I know also that, if I could possibly carry you along those ideal lines, then India would again be really a land of thirty crores of gods.
 But I am labouring under no such delusion. I consider myself a practical idealist. I take from human nature what it yields and go my way. My business is to present to you the realities of the situation, to stimulate your intelligence and your imagination, to touch your hearts and then leave you to do the very best that you can possibly do for a cause so noble and so sacred as that of the Harijans.
 I would like you, lastly, to realize that if we, that  so-called savarna Hindus, failed in this elementary duty by the Harijans during this brief period of probation, Hinduism will be a thing of the past. History teaches us that many a civilization, many a culture perished beyond redemption because of the inherent weakness of the represen- tatives of those bygone civilizations. Do not, therefore, run away with the belief that Hinduism will be an exception and escape the impen- ding doom, if we, Hindus, prove unworthy representatives of the price- less treasures that the rishis have left for us.

  LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL 
 January 15, 1934
 BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
 It is four in the afternoon just now. Today is my weekly silence day. I am writing this in Nagji Purushottam’s bungalow in Calicut. Devdas and Lakshmi arrived today. Thakkar Bapa and Shankerlal will arrive tomorrow. I will see  the  Zamorinlibtech_726_footnotetomorrow  at  2.30  in  the afternoon and then will leave for Trichur at five.
 The question is whether Lakshmi should go to Delhi for her delivery or remain in Madras. She and Devdas will see Raja in about two days. They will come to a final decision after that. Devdas has got the permission to go to Delhi, but I think he should spend about six months in Madras to gain experience. Lakshmi would not like her delivery to take place in his absence and Raja would not like it in his. Thus there is a problem within a problem. Doesn’t the meaning of life consist in solving even such seemingly trivial problems in the right manner ?
 I have specially called Shankerlal here for a brief discussion regarding khadi. I observe that perhaps needless expenditure is being incurred in our department. I wish to place before him what I have observed. I think we should stop the needless expenditure on sending khadi from one province to another. I incline finally towards the practice followed in Anantpur. The practice followed at Saoli seems good. Krishnadas [Gandhi] and Jajuji are experts and they comple- ment each other perfectly. Krishnadas is acquitting himself very well. Keshu is quiet. Ramdas is discontented. He also will become calm by and by.
 Devdas visited Ba. He is full of praise for her courage. She is of course harassad a little. But without harassment there would be no pleasure in being in jail.
 I paid a visit to Guruvayur. There is no resentment there at all. It is true, though, that the Varanashrama  Sangh  had  sent  pahelwanslibtech_727_footnotefrom North India to demonstrate with black flags and get beaten up a little. Two of them had taken control of the dais. They got hold of a man by his feet, whereupon the young men there asked them to get down. An altercation and fighting followed. The  pahelwans  got beaten up a little. They are quite all right, but they did their play-
 
 
 acting cleverly. I sent the two to a dispensary and started the meeting and went on with it as if nothing had happened.libtech_728_footnoteThe crowds continue to be as big as ever. Small and big contributions continue to come in. Another Annapurna, named Kaumudi, came into the limelight. She gave all her ornaments.libtech_729_footnote“Who can harm him whom Rama protects ?” So we will live as He ordains, do His bidding and dance as He wills.
 Two Hungarian women, mother and daughter, met me in Bangalore. Both are expert painters. They lead a simple life. Just now they have dedicated themselves to the service of India. Bhajan music fills them with ecstasy.
 N. seems likely to go to America. S. too may go. I have not written much to you about their doings. What could I write ? Besides, I don’t have the time either.
Amala is getting on fairly well.
 A letter from Mani is enclosed. I have written to Swami for slivers and the books. Since the books will not be of the same size, I don’t know whether he will be able to pack them together. But Swami is resourceful and, if it is possible, he will manage to do that.
Dahyabhai had sent to me Mani’s letter to you.
 If I go to Belgaum, I will surely try to meet both. But my going there is not certain.
 Write to Mani that one need not be with one’s elders in order to serve them. If one does their work, one serves them. It is not wrong to wish to be near them. On the contrary, it is natural to do so. But there is no necessary connection between serving them and  being  near them. Poor girl, she would be thinking that her letter must have been forwarded directly to you. But you must have noticed that it had made a trip to Sabarmati for a dip in the river.libtech_730_footnotelibtech_731_footnoteIt thus got moistened at for or five places. This is of course no new experience to us. But it is our resolve—is it not ?—to remain contented with whatever happens.
 I have not been able to satisfy Gordhanbhai. But he doesn’t write to me now. Towards him, too, I have done my duty as I saw it. I have asked him to let me know the total sum received from Vithalbhai and also to send me the correspondence between them. If I get it, I think I shall have to publish it.
 
 Gujarati letters written by prisoners were first sent to Sabarmati jail for censoring.
 Let him always write to me at Wardha. Even if, however, he writes everything only to you and if I get every such letter, I shall be fully satisfied. I want you yourself to guide him in this matter. I take it that you will write about Ba. I have already written to you about Lakshmi. I am writing to Mridula and Nandubehn.libtech_732_footnoteDevdas went and looked up Brijkrishna. He is quite well. He has survived. He needs rest, which he is taking.
It is certain that Raja will be released on 6th February.
 You should learn not to go on thinking about things, whatever the cause. For that, you should either memorize the Gita or learn Sanskrit or go on reciting the Ramadhun both in the straight and the reverse order.
 I get no time at all for worrying, so you needn’t advise me not to worry.
 Blessings to both from

  LETTER TO GANGABEHN VAIDYA 
 January 15, 1934
 CHI. GANGABEHN,
 I did get news of you from time to time. I deliberately refrained from writing to you. As you were permitted to receive only one letter  I thought you should be able to get other more important letters.
 But, whether I write or not, I always remember all the women workers.
 My message to all the women is this : Irrespective of the resolution or promise made or given at the time of the marchlibtech_733_footnotelibtech_734_footnoteto Ras, let all the women think again independently and take a fresh decision.  I will accept it. I adhere to my previous view. Nobody should persuade anybody else to adopt a particular course. Everyone should decide for herself. It is their religious duty to do so. Each should act according to her capacity and her inclination. It is an accident that I am out of prison. No one should stay in the Red Bungalow. Nobody should stay at any place where he or she is permitted to stay as a matter of favour. A time may come when one may not get a place to
 
 
 live in or anything to eat. We have learnt that it is our dharma to bear such hardships without grumbling and without feeling unhappy about it. This is the essence of the Gita. If other people do not now welcome us, it means that they are not in a position to do so. Why should you be unhappy about it ? However, things have not yet reached that stage. It will indeed be good if they do. It will be a real test for us.
 Every one of the women should not expect a separate letter from me for the present, but I expect them all to write to me.
 You should, of course, write for all. And you should pour out whatever is in your heart. If you need anybody’s help for writing the letter, you may take it. Everyone should tell me in her letter what work she has been doing.
     [PS.]       All 	letters should be sent to the Wardha address. [From Gujarati]  Blessings 	from  BAPU

  	It is of course too much to expect a letter from you. When all of 	you consider me someone to be pitied, how can I expect any letter? I 	think it is only due to his attitude that there is no acknowledgement 	of the letter I  had written to   Saralabehn. I  keep getting 	some new at least about all of you.  	I am writing this letter to pass on Mani’s message. She has 	received Rs. 30 from you. She has received Rs. 25 from Nandubehnlibtech_735_footnotelibtech_736_footnote. Hence she does not at all need any more money. She 	has written many other things. But it only implies that she is at 	peace and her health is good. There are fewer facilities this time. 	There is  no company at all. She is occupying herself in reading and 	spinning. She has also received the books you had sent for her.  	You must be keeping yourself informed about me through the  Harijan.      
 Write to me. Give me news about everyone’s health. Write only at the Wardha address.

  MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF MALABARlibtech_740_footnote 
 [January 16, 1934]libtech_741_footnoteHaving travelled throughout Malabar I have no doubt that the removal of   untouchability  entirely  rests  with  workers.  If   they  will
 prove their faith through character that is above reproach and through
 devotion that counts no sacrifice too great, the hearts of opponents will be melted.
 The Bombay Chronicle, 20-1-1934
 
 
          BA,   LETTER TO KASTURBA GANDHI   January 	16, 1934   There is 	 no  letter from you probably because  Devdas  visited 
  	you. But I hope you received my letter. I have been writing every 	week regularly and also sending the discourses.libtech_742_footnoteDevdas came and saw me. He arrived yesterday. Lakshmi 	also has come. Both are well. We shall part today. I think they will 	both go to Delhi after meeting Rajaji. But it is not finally 	decided. Devdas told me everything about you. It is rather strange 	that they did not permit you to get oil for massage from outside. 	But I was glad to learn from Devdas that you remain cheerful whether 	or not you get the oil or whether the food is good or bad. If the 	reading of the Gita and other sacred books did not bear even 	this fruit, it is the same whether one had read them or not. My 	discourse this time will therefore be about reading books. We read 	in many works that reading of holy books by itself earns merit for 	one. Such statements are intended to encourage us. If we take them 	literally, we shall benefit nothing by reading them. One should 	ponder deeply over what one reads. Pondering deeply means thinking 	how we can apply their teaching in our life. But today I have been 	having a large number of visitors and so I don’t write more. We 	are in Calicut today. I am sure you remember Shyamjibhai. Vali is 	doing   
       1934.

          FRIENDS,   SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, TRICHUR   January 	17, 1934 
  	It gives me very great pleasure to renew my acquaintance with you 	after so many years. But that pleasure is not unmixed with pain 	because of the fact that in an enlightened State like Cochin 	untouchability is still flourishing. It was perhaps whilst I was 	driving through the streets of Trichur this morning, to speak a few 	words to you, that I saw a Nayadi in flesh and blood. He was 	shivering with fear. It was a sign of humiliation for you, for me 	and for all Hindus. It is high time that you wipe out that shame. It 	is also a shame for us that there should be even at this stage men—I 	don’t know anything about women—defending untouchability, 	unapproachability and invisibility in the name of religion. I 	venture to suggest to you that throughout the civilized world such a 	sin cannot possibly be hinted at in the name of religion.  	His Highness the Maharaja by himself cannot possibly change your 	hearts, and I would be wholly wrong were I to go away with the 	belief that untouchability could be removed by a stroke of the pen. 	Nor can this change be brought about by any sort of compulsion. 	Therefore I would say to our sanatanists, or rather those who call 	themselves ‘sanatanists’, that they need not fear the propaganda 	that I am carrying on. I have to appeal to your reason and to your 	hearts and urge you to do your best. The Hindus claim to be 	essentially a nation of toleration. And if there is such a thing as 	untouchability in Hinduism, it will become a religion of 	intolerance.  	I therefore respectfully put to those who are today intending to do 	this propaganda against untouchability to wipe out this blot on 	Hinduism. I have received several letters on this matter and most of 	the pricking letters that I have received on this problem are from 	Travancore and Cochin.  	One word to reformers. If we have sense of our own conviction, if we 	only understand the sanatanists, we should tolerate what our 	brethren may say of us. After all it will depend upon the character 	of the reformers as to what is to be the nature of the reform that 	they are making. The goal of this campaign against untouchability 	depends on the purity of the reformers in this campaign. If they 	stick to their present character and ceaselessly endeavour in their 	task, then this monster of untouchability will be wiped out. But 	patience is required 
 on the part of the reformers. Surely, they must not lose faith though there is no support from the surroundings.
 One word to Hindi friends. I really expected that there would be so much atmosphere in Malabar about Hindi and so many Hindi scholars, that it would be easy for me to speak in Hindi altogether. I was astonished, however, to find that there was no translator  who would translate my Hindi speech, and there was so much disinclination on the part of the audience to allow a Hindi speech. May I suggest to you that this disinclination also bars our way to progress in the campaign against untouchability? I shall simply put it in one sentence. There must be exchange of workers between North and South.  Though we have an inexhaustible supply of workers amongst the Hindi speaking people, if workers from the North cannot possibly come here and explain, it becomes an impossible barrier. You may retort, ‘what about you when you go to the North? Why should not they understand our speech?’ If you will think a little deeper, you will realize that it is an impossible demand. Among Malayalam, Telugu, Canarese, Tamil, what speech should the Northerner adopt? I am myself a lover of all Indian languages. And I have attempted at the age of sixty-five to learn all these languages. I have become a special lover of Southern languages. But my intimate knowledge of this state of affairs demands that, if we are to work for such reform as [eradication of] untouchability, a common knowledge of Hindi is absolutely indispensable, because it is a language spoken by twenty crores out of thirty crores of people, and since we call ourselves  Indians we can expect the thirty crores to try to understand the speech of twenty crores of people.

  SPEECH AT KURUKKANCHERIlibtech_744_footnote 
 January 17, 1934 It is a matter of exceedingly great pleasure for me to renew your acquaintance. The names Ezhavas and Thiyyas are not new to me at
all, nor is the name of Shri Narayana Guru new to me.  I  had  the
 honour of meeting him and having long discussions with him while he was on this earth. It was at that time I came in close contact with many Ezhavas and Thiyyas. I met the leaders and had many friendly discussions  with  them.   1   have   very   pleasant   recollections   of the
 
 affection I received from them without exception. Since then constant correspondence has been kept up between them and myself. Whilst some have differed from the view I have expressed, their affection has not suffered in any way. I treasure that affection. Therefore I am glad that I am once more in your midst.
 I have carefully read the whole of your address. All the remarks that you have made about the institution of caste, as you have interpreted it, have my fullest sympathy. But you know from your experience that the vast majority of questions in this world have at least two sides. They appear differently and bear different meanings also. Caste, in so far as it is based on untouchability, is an institution of the devil, and we must get rid of it at any cost. But I have explained repeatedly that caste expressed as varnadharma is an eternal law which we may not break except at our own risk. There are many laws of Nature, which are still hidden from us. That does not mean that they are not in existence or that they do not operate in our lives. The law of varna was discovered by our ancestors ages ago; and, as I have understood and interpreted it, it has appeared to me a  wholly beneficent law. But like many laws and institutions of Nature this law of varna has been distorted, and we see it today in its hideous form. Man—Hindu man—has disfigured it and made it doubly hideous by tainting it with untouchability. Varnadharma is an economic law. It is my certain conviction that, if the whole world followed that law, the strife that we see around us would cease at once. It is pre-eminently a law of concord, never of discord.
 But I have not come here to give you a dissertation on the law of the varna. I simply want to say that I am in full agreement with you in your fight against untouchability. I entirely endorse your remarks that it has corrupted not Hindu society alone, but has affected other societies also. The assumption of superiority of one class over another is a poison slowly killing us. When Narayana Guru Swami enunciated his formula of one caste, one religion and one God, he had, in my opinion, no other meaning in his mind. He said, ‘I will not tolerate this assumption of superiority on the part of anybody.’ I do not recall in my many discussions with him that he had anything to say against the beneficent interpretation of varnadharma that I have given.
 Let us not, therefore, destroy the tree for its bad or poisonous branches. If you know anything whatsoever of gardening, you know that a gardener who finds diseased branches prunes them. He deals with the whole tree if he finds the tree rotten at the root. He will be considered a foolish gardener deserving summary dismissal who,
 
 because he sees some diseased branches, lays the axe at the root. In our society let us act as wise gardeners. Let us understand the disease that is corroding Hinduism. Let us get rid of untouchability or, in other words, of the evil of superiority and inferiority. Let us first get rid of this evil and purify our hearts. And when we shall have successfully done so, we shall be able to pronounce opinion on the working of the law of varna as I have explained it. Today we know it chiefly as a species of untouchability. Lastly, it is my conviction, and I want you to be infected with that conviction, that untouchability as I have described it to you is fast going. And if you are fired by that conviction, I want you to put forth your best effort to exorcize that devil.

  SPEECH AT UNION CHRISTIAN COLLEGE, ALWAYE 
 January 17, 1934
 It is a matter of great pleasure to me to renew acquaintance with the students and professors of this college. I have very pleasant recollections of my meeting with the students that were in the college at the time of my first visit. It was good of you to think of me while I was passing through this part of the country.
 My message is exceedingly simple. It is no new truth that has dawned upon me today. I have to the best of my ability striven to live up to it for the past fifty years. And the more I have succeeded in living up to it, the greater has been my inward joy. Nor is it for the first time that I am delivering this message to India. But because of some incidents in the recent past, it comes to the people as a new thing. My message is simply this that savarna Hindus, who have been considering themselves superior to those whom they have called untouchables, unapproachables, invisibles or avarna Hindus, should realize that this arrogation of superiority has no sanction whatsoever in the Shastras. If I discovered that those scriptures, which are known as Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Smritis, etc., clearly showed that they claimed divine authority for untouchability as I have described it to you, then nothing on this earth would hold me to Hinduism. I should throw it overboard as I should throw overboard a rotten apple. My reason is offended and my heart is wounded at the
 very thought that God Himself, who has created both savarna Hindus and avarna Hindus, should impose this bar sinister between His children. The very thought that the rishis, who gave the Vedas and the Upanishads and who in every mantra that they pronounced taught the unity of God, could ever conceive of any such thing as untouchability as it is practised today in Hinduism must be repugnant to every intelligent person. But prejudices and superstitions die hard. They cloud the reason, befog the intellect and harden the heart. And so you find learned men defending this untouchability.
 But you, students, should know that behind this message there lurks also a much greater message. This monster of untouchability has invaded every form of society in India; and the idea behind this message is that there should be not only no untouchability as between Hindus and Hindus, but that there should be no untouchability whatsoever between Hindus, Christians, Mussalmans, Parsis and the rest. I am convinced that, if this great change of heart can be brought about among millions of savarna Hindus and their hearts can be purified—as certainly they will be purified—we should live in India as people trusting each other and without any mutual distrust  or suspicion. It is untouchability with all its subtle forms that separates us from one another and makes life itself unlovely and difficult to live.
 You can now, therefore, understand why I am drawing upon the sympathy of all Indians, to whatever faith they may belong. Indeed I have not hesitated to ask the support of the whole world, not by way of pecuniary offering but by their sympathy, their prayers and their study of the question with all its implications. I want their heart symp- athy, which is infinitely greater than any pecuniary offering. I do not stretch out my hand before them for money because they are not debtors to Harijans. It is for savarna Hindus to discharge this debt.
 To conclude, this prayerful support and sympathy can only be given by non-Hindus, if they have no distrust of this movement and if they are satisfied that this is a movement of inward purification and deeply religious. Remember that I have not idly given this message which has come straight from the heart. I have gladly taken your purse which is a spontaneous offering from you. But I have accepted it as a bond between you and myself and as a token of your
 
 determination to give me the fullest support you  are  capable  of giving. And since I am a good accountant, I shall ask an account from you and shall want to know from time to time what part you have played in this movement.

DEAR FRIENDS,
 
 It is altogether wrong and reprehensible for people to threaten to fast if I do not go to a particular place. You can easily see that if many people issued such threats they can make it impossible for me to go anywhere. I hope, therefore, that you will apologize and with- draw your threat.

  CIRCULAR 		RE : CHANGE IN TOUR PROGRAMME  
 CAMP WARDHA,
 November 7, 1933
  DEAR 	FRIEND,   RE: 	CHANGE IN GANDHIJI’S 	PROGRAMME 
  It 	has been found necessary, quite unavoidable, to make a substantial 	alteration in the order of the programme of Mahatmaji’s proposed 	tour, extending over 9 months— November 1933 to July 1934. After 	touring in the Central Provinces, where the tour has commenced from 	today, and after attending the Central Board meeting at Delhi— 	December 10 to 14—he will go directly to Andhra, and the rest of 	the Madras  Presidency, instead of going up to the Punjab, Sind, 	etc., and will thereafter work his way to Bengal and Assam and then 	westward. The new order will, therefore, be as follows :  C. 	P., Delhi, Andhra, Madras City, Mysore States and Malabar District, 	Cochin and Travancore, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Calcutta, Bengal, Assam, 	Bihar, U.P., Punjab, Sind and Rajputana, Gujarat and Kathiawar, 	Bombay City, Maharashtra and Hyderabad Dn., and Karanataka at the 	end of July 1934. 
 The dates of the tour in the various provinces and other details are given in the sub–joined table. The details of the tour in each province will be settled and filled up by the Provincial Secretaries in consultation with their Presidents in accordance with  detailed instructions already issued. But the four elementary rules to be observed are mentioned below :
  There 	should be full four hours cessation of public work for meals and 	correspondence in the 	middle of the day, preferably from 10.0 a.m. to 2.0 p.m.  The 	day’s work should not begin earlier than 6.30 a.m. and not 	[continue] later than 8.0 p.m.  Railway 	journey is any day preferable to motor journey, but where the latter 	is unavoidable, 	it should not exceed 75 miles in one day.  Mondays 	and Tuesdays in every week are non–working days and should be kept 	free of any travelling or public engagement. To be accurate, the 	period from 8 p.m. on Sunday to 8 p.m. on Tuesday is reserved, 24 	hours for silence and 24 hours for correspondence and other work.

 MOHAMMED IQBAL’S STATEMENTlibtech_748_footnote
 LAHORE,
 December 6, 1933
 “The offer made by the Aga Khan to Mr. Gandhi in London in 1931 still holds good. If under Pandit Jawaharlal’s leadership, the Hindus and the Congress agree to the safeguards which the Muslims think necessary for their protection as an all–India minority, the Muslim community will still be ready to serve as camp–followers of the majority community in India’s political struggle” says Sir Mohammed Iqbal in a statement issued today referring to Pandit Jawaharlal’s charges against the communalist Muslim leaders.
 Sir Mohammed Iqbal observes that the Aga Khan made a similar offer to Mr. Gandhi in 1932 but Mr. Gandhi would not guarantee acceptance of his position by the Congress and also the Hindu and Sikh delegates did not endorse Mr. Gandhi’s position and further Mr. Gandhi wanted the Muslims not to support the untouchables’ claims. After explaining the Muslim attitude towards nationalism and democracy, Sir  Mohammed Iqbal puts the straight question to Pandit Jawaharlal, “How is India’s problem to be solved if the majority community neither concedes the minimum necessary safeguards to the minority community, nor accepts a third party’s award ? The position can admit of two alternatives only. Either, India’s majority community must accept for
 
 
 itself the permanent position of an agent of British imperialism in the East or India should be redistributed on the basis of religious, historical and cultural affinities so as to do away with the question of electorates and the communal problems in its present form.”
 The Bombay Chronicle, 7–12–1933
 
 
 APPENDIX III
 EXTRACTS FROM JAWAHARLAL NEHRU’S STATEMENTlibtech_749_footnote
 . . . I do not think that the Muslim communal organizations, chief of whom are the Muslim All–Parties Conference and the Muslim League, represent any large group of Muslims in India except in the sense that they exploit the prevailing communal sentiment. But the fact remains that they claim to speak for Muslims, and no other organization has so far risen which can successfully challenge that claim. Their aggressively communal character gives them a pull over the large number of nationalist Muslims who merge themselves in the Congress. The leaders of these organizations are patently and intensely communal. That, from the very nature of things, one can understand.
 But it is equally obvious that most of them are definitely anti–national and political reactionaries of the worst kind. Apparently they do not even look forward to any common nation developing in India.
 At a meeting in the British House of Commons last year the Aga Khan, Sir Mohammed Iqbal and Dr. Shafaat Ahmad Khan are reported (in The Statesman of December 31, 1932) to have laid stress on “the inherent impossibility of securing any merger of Hindu and Moslem, political, or indeed, social, interests”. The speakers further pointed out “the impracticability of ever governing India through anything but a British agency”. These statements leave no loophole for nationalism or for Indian freedom, now or even in the remote future.
 I do not think that these statements represent the views of Muslims generally or even of most of the communally inclined Muslims. But they are undoubtedly the views of the dominant and politically clamorous group among the Muslims. It is an insult to one’s intelligence to link these views with those of nationalism and freedom, and of course any measure of real economic freedom is still further away from them. Essentially, this is an attitude of pure reaction—political, cultural, national, social. And it is not surprising that this should be so if one examines the membership of these organizations. Most of the leading members are Government officials, ex–officials, ministers, would–be ministers, knights and title–holders, big landlords, etc. Their leader is the Aga Khan, the head of a wealthy religious group, who combines in himself, most remarkably, the feudal order and the politics and habits of the British ruling class, with which he has been intimately associated for many years.
 Such being the leadership of the Muslims in India and at the Round Table
 
 Conference it is no wonder that their attitude should be reactionary. This reactionary policy went so far as to lead many of the Muslim delegates in London to seek an alliance with the most reactionary elements in British public life—Lord Lloyd and company. And the final touch was given to it when Gandhiji offered personally to accept every single one of their communal demands, however illogical and exaggerated they might be, on condition that they assured him of their full support in the political struggle for independence. That condition and offer were not accepted and it became clear that what stood in the way was not even communalism but political reaction.
 Personally I think that it is generally possible to co–operate with communalists provided the political objective is the same. But between progress and reaction, between those who struggle for freedom and those who are content with servitude, and even wish to prolong it, there is no meeting ground. And it is this political reaction which has stalked the land under cover of communalism and taken advantage of the fear of each community of the other. It is the fear complex that we have to deal with in these communal problems. Honest communalism is fear; false communalism is political reaction.
 To some extent this fear is justified, or is at least understandable, in a minority community. We see this fear overshadowing the communal sky in India as a whole so far as Muslims are concerned; we see it as an equally potent force in the Punjab and Sind so far as the Hindus are concerned, and in the Punjab the Sikhs.
 It was natural for the British Government to support and push on the reactionary leaders of the Muslims and to try to ignore the nationalist ones. It was also natural for them to accede to most of their demands in order to strengthen their position in their own community and weaken the national struggle. A very little knowledge of history will show that this has always been done by ruling powers. The Muslim demands did not in any way lessen the control of the British in India. To some extent they helped the British to add to their proposed special powers and to show to the world how necessary their continued presence in India was.
 I have written all this about the attitude of the Muslim communalist leaders not only to complete the picture but because it is a necessary preliminary to the  understanding of the Hindu communal attitude. There is no essential difference between the two. But there was this difference that the Congress drew into its ranks most of the vital elements of Hindu society and it dominated the situation and thus circumstances did not permit the Hindu communalists to play an important role in politics. The Hindu Mahasabha leaders largely confined themselves to criticizing the Congress. When however there was a lull in Congress activities, automatically the Hindu communalists came more to the front and their attitude was frankly reactionary.
 It must be remembered that the communalism of a majority community must of
 necessity bear a closer resemblance to nationalism than the communalism of a minority group. One of the best tests of its true nature is what relation it bears to the national struggle. If it is politically reactionary or lays stress on communal problems rather than national ones, then it is obviously anti–national. . ..
 I cannot hold the Mahasabha responsible for these statementslibtech_750_footnotebut as a matter of fact they fit in with, and are only a slight elaboration of, the Mahasabha attitude. And they bear out that many Hindu communalists are definitely thinking on the lines of co– operation with British imperialism in the hope of getting favours. It requires little argument to show that this attitude is not only narrowly communal but also anti–national and intensely reactionary. . . .
 It is perfectly true that Hindu Mahasabha has stood for joint electorates right through its career and this is obviously the only national solution of the problem. It is also true that the Communal Award is an utter negation of nationalism and is meant to separate India into communal compartments and give strength to disruptive tendencies and thus to strengthen the hold of British imperialism. But it must be borne in mind that nationalism cannot be accepted only when it profits the majority community. The test comes in the provinces where there is a Muslim majority and in that test the Hindu Mahasabha has failed.
 Nor is it enough to blame Muslim communalists. It is easy enough to do so for Indian Muslims as a whole are unhappily very backward and compare unfavourably with Muslims in all other countries. The point is that a special responsibility does attach to the Hindus in India both because they are the majority community and because economically and educationally they are more advanced. The Mahasabha, instead of discharging that responsibility, has acted in a manner which has undoubtedly increased the communalism of the Muslims and made them distrust the Hindus all the more. The only way it has tried to meet their communalism is by its own variety of communalism. One communalism does not end the other; each feeds on the other and both fatten. . .
 I cannot say what following the Hindu or Muslim communal organizations have. It is possible that in a moment of communal excitement each side may command the allegience of considerable numbers. But I do submit that on both sides these organizations represent the rich upper class groups and the struggle for communal advantages is really an attempt of these groups to take as big a share of power and privilege for themselves as possible. At the most, it means jobs for a few of our unemployed intellectuals. How do these communal demands meet the needs of the masses ? What is the programme of the Hindu Mahasabha or the Muslim League for the workers, the peasants and the lower middle classes, which form the great bulk of the nation ? They have no programme except a negative one, as the Mahasabha hinted at Ajmer, of not disturbing the present social order. This in itself shows that the controlling
 
 forces of these communal organizations are the upper class possessing social groups today. The Muslim communalists tell us a great deal about the democracy of Islam but are afraid of democracy in practice; the Hindu communalists talk of nationalism and  think in terms of a “Hindu Nationalism”.
 Personally I an convinced that Nationalism can only come out of the ideological fusion of Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and other groups in India. That does not and need not mean the extinction of any real culture of any group, but it does mean a common national outlook, to which other matters are subordinated. I do not think that Hindu–Muslim or other unity will come merely by reciting [it] libtech_751_footnotelike a mantra. That it will come I have no
 doubt, but it will come from below, not above, for many of those above are too much interested in British domination and hope to preserve their special privileges through it. Social and economic forces will inevitably bring other problems to the front. They will create cleavages along different lines, but the communal cleavage will go.
 I have been warned by friends, whose opinion I value, that my attitude towards communal organizations will result in antagonizing many people against me. That is indeed probable. I have no desire to antagonize any countryman of mine for we are in the midst of a mighty struggle against a powerful opponent. But that very struggle demands that we must check harmful tendencies and always keep the goal before us. I would be false to myself, to my friends and comrades, so many of whom have sacrificed their all at the altar of freedom and even to those who disapprove of what I say, if I remained a silent witness to an attempt to weaken and check our great struggle for freedom. Those, who, in my opinion, are helping in this attempt may be perfectly honest in the beliefs they hold. I do not challenge their bona fides. But none the less, the beliefs may be wrong, anti– national and reactionary.
 I write as an individual, and, in this matter, I claim to represent no one but myself. Many may agree with me; I hope they do. But whether they do so or do not, I must say frankly what I have in my mind. That is not perhaps the way of politicians, for, in politics, people are very careful of what they say and do not say lest they offend some group or individual and lose support. But I am not a politician by choice; forces stronger than me have driven me to this field and, it may be, that I have yet to learn the ways of politicians.
