POONA,
   MY 	DEAR DHANNOlibtech_21_footnote,  September 	1, 1945 
  	I wonder whether you know Gujarati, Hindustani or Sindhi, seeing 	that you write to me in bad English? Your mother knows Hindustani 	and Sindhi. Your father knew all the above three well. But this I 	write in the language you evidently know best.  	You see now is the time for every patriot to be tested. You wear 	khadi not for family tradition which may or may not be good, not for 	my sake (that would be of no use), not for the poor (there are other 	ways of serving them perhaps), but for swaraj to be gained 	non-violently. Then you have to wear and use khadi at all cost. Then 	to strengthen your conviction you may add all the other causes. Use 	of khadi is the least you should do and brave the little difficulty 	you mention. Supposing you slave for a showy maintenance for 10 	hours, why won’t you lighten your slavery by doing recreative 	spinning for half an hour daily? While you are doing it, you will 	have the glow of spinning swaraj daily for half an hour. Very little 	if you were the only one. But one can multiply oneself into forty 	crores and then there is swaraj without perhaps more. But if you can 	say to yourself honestly that you have no time for non-violent 	swaraj, you must leave khadi alone and use the cloth you like best 	and forget family traditions, the poor and me.  	What are you earning? Are you married? Love.  BAPU  CHI. 	DHANNO GIDWANI 	C/O 	AMBICA 	MILL 	NO. 	1 AHMEDABAD  From 	a photostat: G.N. 6759. Also Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal

 Naraharibhai writes to tell me that as Khimji has a defect in his eye you have raised an objection to his marrying Vina and are even ready to write to her father. This surprises me. I, therefore, used an “if” in my replylibtech_23_footnoteto Narahari.
 When K. and N. have made the selection, what objection can we have? Besides, how can you write to Vina’s father? Vina is not marrying the man in defiance of anybody’s advice. I personally do not see what right a father can have to interfere if the two  have selected each other despite an obvious defect in one of them. And do all the blind remain unmarried?

And now that all of you are 	fighting against cholera, where is the question of possessing any 	right ? Never mind if people do not want to get inoculated. Let them 	die, if they are prepared to. They will have to be kept isolated if 	they  contract cholera. There are bound to be such people in the 	Ashram.      
 While expanding bhangi work, remember that the  Bhangi though regarded the lowest of all, by dint of doing the noblest work (of cleaning), has the highest place in the eyes of God.

       POONA,  [Before September 2, 1945]libtech_43_footnoteIn the course of their interview, the two leaders asked Mahatma Gandhi as to whether the Hindustan Mazdoor Sevak Sangh like the Indian National Congress and  the 	All-India Trade Union 	Congress could adopt the 	words “peaceful and 	legitimate” instead 	of “truth and 	non-violence” in 	its constitution. 	Mahatma  Gandhi  is 	understood to have replied that he disagreed with those who held that “truth and      
 non-violence” were not political terms. In the political context, the words “peaceful and legitimate” were considered to be more appropriate. Even this expression, Mahatma Gandhi said, had been introduced by him in the Congress constitutionlibtech_44_footnote. Since they had to deal with the working class, the objection on grounds of political terminology did not matter. The workers must be told in a straight and direct way as to what they should or should not do.
 On the question of trusteeship, which was absent from the constitution of the Sangh, Mahatma Gandhi is said to have pointed out that since the theory  of  trusteeship was stressed by him and had a permanent association with his name, it was legitimate to make it a matter of dispute. He said that he did not want to accentuate class-struggle. The owners should become trustees. They might insist that they should become trustees and yet they might choose to remain owners.
We shall then have to oppose and fight them. Satyagraha will
 then be our weapon. Even if we want a classless society we should not engage in a civil war. Non-violence should be depended  upon  to bring a classless society.

  	Today I am sending a wirelibtech_50_footnoteregarding your fast. There is a rule that no one 	should go on a fast without my permission. It is possible that you 	are not aware of it but Prabhakar knows this.  	Both of you are at fault in going on a fast. When all of you should 	render service in treating [cholera] patients, why enfeeble 	yourselves by fasting?  	I would say that those who are not willing to be inoculated against 	cholera should not be persuaded to do so by fasting. Those who 	cannot abide by the rules of an institution should leave it. We do 	not have such rules [in our Ashram]. I am primarily responsible for 	this because I do not believe in inoculation, etc. Right from South 	Africa I have been holding these views. We should make arrangements 	for those who wish to be inoculated but we should not force those 	who are unwilling by resorting to a fast. If you want to know when 	one can go on a fast, come to me when I have some leisure.  	Who were the persons involved in beating Kotwal? What happened to 	him? Give me the details when you have time.

 Your 	letter. I purposely write to you in English.  	I mentioned not 14 letters in the Urdu script but 14 scripts 	collected on the chart shown to you.  	I see that you can listen to hearsay even though it is contrary to 	the evidence of your senses. You should know that Kakasaheb is 	himself a Maharashtrian and so are my many associates.  	I was referring to a well-known verse of the Gitalibtech_61_footnote. It asks us not to leave what may appear to be a 	lesser duty for what may happen to be a higher. And I paid a 	compliment to Maharashtrians who stick to their jobs no matter how 	difficult they are.  	Urdu is not so difficult as your friend has made it out. I know many 	who have learnt the Urdu script in less than a week. My offer to 	teach you Urdu script within a week still stands. I shall put before 	you a deputy to teach you, if you care. The 	connection between learning Hindustani and exhibiting         
 your skill in massage is obvious. I see such exhibitions against a fee, the fee in your case being that you should learn Hindustani against an exhibition of your skill.
You won’t now give me a long letter to answer?

  	If it is very difficult, we should not try it. It would not matter 	if we failed. I would suggest that the amount raised in Bombay 	should be added to the collection from Gujarat.

  September 	6, 1945  	I am exceedingly sorry that I misplaced your letter and have been 	the cause of troubling you to send me a copy. I have now read the 	same and I had your telegram also about it. My personal opinion is 	that there should be no distribution of seats but that elections 	should be on a basis of adult suffrage and only one electorate. But 	mine is a voice in the wilderness. Therefore, I am afraid, it will 	not count among divided counsellors. You claim to represent 300 	million. Congress is also a representative organization; so is the 	Muslim League and many other organizations. You have, therefore, to 	secure their co-operation.  	I have been much misunderstood when I have asserted that I claim no 	representative capacity. That I have influesnce over some    
 persons does not make me a representative. I would therefore urge you to secure the co-operation, if you can, of the Congress and the Muslim League.

  	Your letter. My further substantiation for my position comes from my 	own life and that of others, Hindus and non-Hindus who have tried to 	live the truth that is in us. I wholly accept your statement that 	just as faith without work is dead so is work without faith and you 	admit that you have begun to doubt yourself, i. e., your work. Doubt 	and you are lost. Is it possible to go further and doubt the 	sacrifice behind your work? My extensive experience tells me that 	work speaks

Spinning 	and the entire 	processing of 	cotton should be 	done with 	full knowledge.  Some 	good craft should also be 	taught. That too 	should be 	done with full 	knowledge. There 	should be 	perfect cleanliness in 	the camp 	as also 	among individuals. 
 
  The 	basis of 	self-sufficiency should 	be silk.  The 	work of the 	camp should be 	done so 	far as 	possible by 	the inmates. Let there 	be as few servants as possible. The 	workers, as far as possible, should be women.  The 	camp should be 	located in 	or near a 	village and 	the life in 	the camp should resemble 	the life 	of the villagers. 
 I have written this much by way of giving guidelines. The rules that may be received from the central authority must be followed.
What I have written should be sufficient. If not, let me know.

  DEAR 	SIR VISVESVARAYYA libtech_108_footnote,  	I have your letter of the 7th July. I know I am very late in 	replying to it but it was inevitable. As it is I am sending even 	this late line under pressure. I appreciate your zeal in the cause 	you have at heart and marvel at the fact that at your time of life 	you throw into your work so much energy and thought. There, however, 	my appreciation, I fear, stands.  	Of course, verbally our objectives appear the same but when I look 	at our means, the difference seems to me to be unbridgeable. It may 	be that both of us being old and hardened are unable to see eye to 	eye. If you regard South Africa as an elongated part of the West, I 	have passed the best part of my life in the West. I have seen 	people, high and low, working with amazing speed and with the most 	modern machinery, the income of the commonest European labourer 	being higher than that of the American. Yet it was there that I 	learnt to recoil from their method and manner. They preyed upon the 	misery of the    
 Negro, holding him and his wife as beasts of burden. Things, therefore, that attract you do not attract me but rather repel me. Much as I would love to work as a humble co-worker side by side with you, I cannot.
 Your detailed, patient replieslibtech_109_footnotelibtech_110_footnotecarefully prepared, fail to convince me. What is the use of taxing you further with my questions? Let me tell you that I claim to have been working schemes fairly successfully among the village population with  well-knit  organizations.  Nearly four crores (as I can recall) have been distributed among the villagers, not as doles, but for solid work done—and this in the face of heavy odds. Had it not been for the opposition of the Government and their unreasoned wrath after the August of 1942, the said organizations would have shown greater results. But I cannot expect you with your Krishnasagar marvels to your credit even to look at my scheme. I can, therefore, only conclude by expressing my eagerness to follow not your scheme but your solid work and learn from it, if I see anything to learn.
I hope you are keeping perfectly well and fit.

If  Jajuji 	engages Ramprasad in place of Motilal Rathi and Ramprasad takes up 	the work, I will welcome it. I do not understand Ramprasad asking 	for still higher pay, but if Jajuji decides to increase it I will 	not object. I myself will not be able to decide in the matter. If 	Ramprasad undertakes to look after the construction of the building, 	will the couple stay there or continue to stay in the Ashram? This 	also will have to be decided by you.    
 I don’t need further particulars about the sum of Rs. 5,000 received through Rasiklal. Permit it to be used for the Harijan work planned by Bapa. I have an impression that he suggested its being used in Kathiawar.

    CHI. 	NARANDAS,  September 	12, 1945 
  	I got your letter and the statement. You will see that I have made 	many changes in the statement. I do hope that you will understand 	the reasons behind them. They do not violate the existing rules of 	the Charkha Sangh. Just now my advice to you is that you may follow 	the practice of offering 1_ per cent discount to any  member  buying 	khadi worth Rs. 100 from the store which you are running or the 	stores which are being run under your supervision in Kathiawar. If 	the Charkha Sangh accepts this rule, it should decide to buy khadi 	only from the stores under the control of the respective branches. 	If, 
 instead, a member from Kanyakumari wants to buy khadi from a store under the Punjab branch, there will be a danger of extensive malpractices.
 Your scheme does have my blessings, of course. I will, moreover, definitely send something with anybody from here going there.
 Balasaheb Kher is engaged on the 2nd and the 3rd. He,  therefore, cannot come. He has suggested the following names in his place. Narahari Parikh, Morarji Desai, Kaka Kalelkar, Dada Maval- ankar. From among them Kaka Kalelkar is here. I met him. I think he will be able to give the maximum work. Narahari cannot be spared at all just now. He has taken upon himself a lot of work. Kaka can arrive there on the 1st and must return on the 4th. He will not, therefore, be able to undertake a long tour there. He has agreed to attend an important meeting in Bombay on the 6th.
 You are entering your 60th year today, but according to me you should aspire to live for another 60 years still. You may, therefore, be said to have completed half the journey. Only today I read in a book that a man should aspire to live 150 years. Even if the millions could entertain such an aspiration, it would be meaningless, for the condition affixed is that the person concerned should spend all these years in service in the spirit of yajna, that is, without attachment. It is an extremely dfficult job to practise non-attachment. But anybody who can cultivate it is sure to live up to 125, and you have the ability to cultivate it.libtech_111_footnote

  	I am sending Narandas’s statement and his letter along with this. 	Go through it and if you think that what he has stated is right, we 	should try to have such members from all over the country. I think 	it is almost impossible to implement what he has suggested regarding 	the Congress as we do not have the required atmosphere. If we    
 succeed in getting [enough] members we may be able to create the atmosphere. That is to say the Charkha Sangh has to impress the Congress by its own work. We have to devise the ways of gaining the strength to do so.

Shri Haridas Mitra, an M.A. of the Calcutta University and the 	husband of Shri Subhas Chandra Bose’s young niecelibtech_112_footnotelibtech_113_footnote, aged 22 years, is under sentence of death over what 	appears to be an untenable ground. I have perused the petition for 	mercy by the uncle of the condemned as also of Advocate Carden Noad. 	I suggest that they furnish cogent grounds for the exercise of 	mercy. In any event the case for mercy becomes irresistible in that 	the war with Japan is over. It will be a political error of the 	first magnitude if this sentence of death is carried into effect. I 	rejoiced to learn that you had ordered postponement of execution 	till after consideration of the case by you on your return.  	My attention was drawn to the case by the prisoner’s wife as she 	has often sung at my prayer meetings when I had the honour of being 	a guest of Advocate Sarat Chandra Bose whom I am happy to learn the 	Government of India has ordered to be released.libtech_114_footnote

    BHAI 	SHYAMLAL,  September 	19, 1945 
  	I got your letter of the 7th instant a few days ago. In one of the 	circulars I see that people have been asked to send their replies by 	the 21st or 22nd September at the time of the Committee’s meeting. 	If the pamphlet was to be sent only after you got my reply, then the 	time is over. Till today I have not been able to read the pamphlet. 	And ever if I had sent my reply, I think it would have been 	impossible to send the circulars to all the Provinces and get their 	replies in time. How can we work in such haste? And it is almost 	impossible for me to send my reply by return of post. At times I 	could reply to brief letters but not always. What shall we do in 	such a situation? It would be better not to wait for my permission 	for what is to be done urgently and in case it is imperative to have 	my permission I should be informed telegra- phically. Then perhaps 	it would be possible for me to keep the reply ready.  	I have gone through all the circulars. I think there is no need for 	any amendment. If the circulars are not sent as yet, change the 	dates and send them out and they should be placed before the 	Committee’s next meeting or a copy should be sent to all after 	getting the reply.  	Yesterday I got Suchetabehn’s letter. I am enclosing it. It should 	be kept in the office and a copy should be sent to Bapa. It would be 	better that she gives us a trial and we give her a trial for three 	months. And later on she can stay permanently if she is prepared to. 	She can keep travelling between Allahabad and Wardha. I don’t find 	any      
 objection to that. Just now there is no need to fix any salary for her. She has gone to Bombay today. She will meet Bapa there.
I am sending back all the circulars. They may be of some use

         CHI. 	KAILAS,  MOUNT 	 PLEASANT ROAD  BOMBAY,  September 	21, 1945 
  	I got your letter just as I reached Bombay. Your handwriting is good 	but not clear enough to be read easily. If you write slightly bigger 	letters and do not mix them up, it will be easier to decipher.  	You cannot ride on two horses. A family cannot run properly if all 	the children stay with the parents all the time. When children grow 	older, they have to go out for earning, studying or serving. And 	when they go out, they have to forget their old and ailing parents. 	So why do you feel unhappy for what is inevitable? When your parents 	sent you out, they and you yourself must have thought not only that 	your duty was to serve your parents, but that it was time that you 	started earning and lessened their burden. That is exactly what you 	are doing. It is good that you are doing all your work and slowly 	learning every- thing. You will bring credit to yourself, your 	parents and the Ashram if you settle down there, stop worrying and 	take care of your health.  	I am very happy to know that you wanted to have chillies but gave 	them up on your own. I know that some people are so much    
 used to chillies that they would rather die than give them up. This shows that taking chillies is not a good habit. In India it so happens that the poor cannot afford anything else and they add a few chillies and salt to the rotlalibtech_140_footnotelibtech_141_footnoteto somehow make it digestible. To conclude from this that all must take chillies is sheer ignorance. When a person takes all kinds of food including rotlas as well, the latter cannot be regarded as part of his diet. On the contrary they may be superfluous and might even prove to be harmful.

164,"September 21, 1945",LETTER TO KRISHNACHANDRA,"
  
 September 21, 1945
 CHI. KRISHNACHANDRA,
I arrived here at 4 o’clock today. I have your letter.
 When a person takes beer with two per cent alcohol content and is forbidden to take whisky with 75 per cent alcohol content, can I ask why beer and why not whisky? You must see also that when we drink lemonade or eat things with some alcohol content in them nobody says that we are taking alcohol. Equate chillies with whisky and then consider if chillies can go with turmeric or coriander. Taking spices does not mean consuming all kinds of spices. There is said to be a lot of difference between green chillies and red chillies. It is surprising that all these simple things have escaped your attention. Whatever spices we give, like turmeric, black pepper, coriander, etc., are given on doctor’s recommendation and on grounds of health. Even so, who can prevent anyone from eating for taste, and how can it be done? Have you not heard that a Vagharilibtech_142_footnotewoman used to relish greatly a two-day stale bajra chapati without ghee, but when she was given kheerlibtech_143_footnoteand wheat  halwalibtech_144_footnotelibtech_145_footnoteto eat every day she started shrinking and fell ill in the end. Shall we then say that this Vaghari woman had con- quered her palate and subsisted on dry bread, chillies and salt? What else should I write?
 
 Why did you not ask me till today about taking chillies on grounds of health? Of course we do let Shakaribehn have chillies willingly. But how can we give it to others? The reason is not that chillies have no good qualities at all. They certainly have some medicinal value. But chillies have no place in a hospital except as a “pain-killer” which is an extract of chillies. In the Ashram we neither take nor give anything merely for taste. But we do not ask everybody whether they relish what they eat and if they do so they should leave the Ashram. If we take this view, none but animals and birds will be left in the Ashram.
Kamle should somehow calm down and improve his health.
 I have already written about Purnachandraji. While living in the Ashram everyone has to observe brahmacharya. I did not know about Ramprasadji. But I was under the impression that Ramprasad’s house was a little away from the other houses of the Ashram. Niamat’s room was also there but she was never asked whether she wanted to observe brahmacharya. But I had thought that Ramprasad had not come to live in the Ashram like Niamat. However, when I came to know that the manner in which they lived they could even produce children I was perturbed. Besides others this is the strorgest reason for one to leave the Ashram. His having a separate kitchen also used to irk me. But since this had been allowed in the case of others I could not be too insistent in dissuading him.
 It is not enough to assume that Purnachandraji must be obser- ving brahmacharya while staying in the Ashram. It is necessary to ask him clearly.
I hope to go to Poona from here on the 24th."

 Dr. Bharatan Kumarappa has, in his pages on “Villagism”, a new word coined by him, furnished the lay reader and the village worker, not conversant with books on economics, a comparative and historical study of the modern movements known as Capitalism and Socialism, not excluding Marxism and Communism,  and  has earnestly, and I think convincingly, shown, amongst other reasons advanced by him, that the past two wars of our generation have proved the utter bankruptcy of such economic orders. Incidentally, the wars seem to me to have proved the bankruptcy of war, meaning in forcible and naked language violence, which is not less because it is organized by States reputed to be civilized. Whether non-violence will effectively replace violence for keeping the peace of the world remains to be seen. Certain it is that mankind, if it continues along its mad career of exploitation of the weak by the strong, must rush to annihilation fore- told in all religions. Dr. Bharatan Kumarappa shows that “Villagism” as it is being attempted in India, based as it is on truth and non- violence, is well calculated to avert the doom. If the reader is interested in the life-saving process, he must turn to the instructive pages written by Dr. Bharatan Kumarappa during his recent imprisonment.libtech_149_footnote

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 As Kakasaheb is going there, he himself may be regarded as my message. Still I shall say this: The yajna this time is of a different character. Yarn is taking the place of gold and silver coins. In other words, labour takes the place of currency and claims equality with it. If this new practice is kept up and spreads, it will have effects too far-reaching to be estimated. In this there should be no place for fraud or untruth. Even the best of plans are ruined if they are mixed with fraud or untruth.

 I enclose herewith Chi. Parnerkar’s letter and also that of Chi. Kishorelal. Both are worth thinking over. The subject matter in each is different and yet the same. Everyone, that is to say, all the institutions there should ponder over K’s letter. How did a saintly person like Kishorelal, working under Parnerkar, accept defeat? Do not get muddled. Leave the letter aside if you are unable to make head or tail of it. Everyone will not benefit by reading it. Only you three should read it. Write to me if you can think of something after some consultations; otherwise forget about it. Give it up if too much time is consumed in discussion. Naraharibhai is the secretary of the Committee, so he should think over both the letters: 1. Should the institutions be kept separate ? Will that be possible now ? (The subject matter of K.’s letter.,) 2. Can’t two neighbours live in amity? They may cultivate the land separately and have their cattle, fruit trees, and water supply separate. (The subject matter of Parnerkar’s letter.)
 Yesterday there was a letter from Gordhandas. It seems Sharda is cured of the fever. She had both typhoid and malaria. I have written about the need for being careful in the matter of diet.

 somebody is not present, what effect can his absence have, and why need it have any? All this seems improper to me. If you have sent anything to  Nava Kallibtech_183_footnotesimilar to what you wrote to  me,  you  have made a mistake.
 I have written to Bapa regarding your camp. It is quite a few days since I did that. You must get the permission row. It would of course be excellent if a hospital could be run at the same time.
 Why do you even have the suspicion that I am displeased with Shankarraoji these days? I don’t tkink about that matter at all. I have not read his article regarding Satara. I chance to read very few of such writings.
 The members of the Committee ought not to be concerned whether I remain silent or rot.
 It is probable that Narandas may come here after Rentia Baras. What does it matter if you do not come to see me though you are so near? So long as you are going on with the work, where is the need for you to come and see me? When you have no work, you are of course free to come.

  	I have read your letter. If what you say is true, it is worth 	considering. You must show your letter to Kumarappa. If you permit 	me, I shall do so. You cannot suppress the complaint you have 	mentioned. I also wonder how you can stay in such an institution? 	Is’ nt there exaggeration in what you say? Meanwhile, I am 	preserving your letter.  MAGANWADI 	WARDHA  From 	a copy of the Gujarati: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal       	[September 1945] It is true that the Congress 	adopted khadi, the Spinners’ Association imposed the condition of 	the yarn quota and khadi which is 	not certified by the Association is taboo for Congressmen. A certain  	quantity of yarn has to be given as part of the price of khadi. All 	this is true. But I do not find anything wrong in this. That action 	alone can be compulsion where there is penalty for refusing to do a 	particular thing. What the form of punishment should be is a 	different matter. There is no compulsion if I demand the price of 	khadi and refuse to give it free. Similarly there is some condition 	or other attached to membership in any institution. It is also no 	compulsion if subseque- ntly any change is made in such conditions. 	The case of uncertified kkadi is also similar. If we go in for 	uncertified khadi, where is the guarantee of its purity and that a 	proper wage has been paid to the spinner ?  	With the advance of time and experience, changes have to be made in 	the rules and regulations. The only questions to be consi- dered are 	whether the change fulfils the object, is in keeping with the 	principle of truth and non-violence, and is actuated by selfish or    
 benevolent motives. The answer to all these questions will show that the change was to fulfil the original object and the question of compulsion does not arise.
 I should be thanked if, against my goods, I ask for yarn or some other commodity in place of money.
 Let us go a little deeper. We believe that khadi is only for those who believe that non-violent swaraj can be established by making khadi universal. Spinning, even for a little time, by  the  greatest number of people will be helpful in obtaining swaraj. We do not therefore spin under compulsion but of our  own  accord.  An additional gain is that through spinning we come in direct contact with the poor.
 Therefore, I am quite clear that there is absolutely no com- pulsion in demanding part of the price of khadi in the form of yarn.

216,,LETTER TO RAIHANA TYABJI,"
          CHI. 	RAIHANA,     October 	l, 1945 
  	Today I got your letter. I also read Salehbhai’s article. Some of 	the things he says are true but neither Burma nor India has any 	power. Nobody would listen to a true Indian or Burmese and he cannot 	do much. The true dharma of India is to achieve independence and 	help Burma and other countries to attain it. All this enmity would 	disappear after both are free. At present no one will pay heed to 	what Salehbhai says. He would be regarded as merely an official. My 	advice is that he should silently serve [the cause] as much as he 	can. An official’s dharma is not to speak but act. Pass 	this on to  Salehbhai.

     The 				dirt which 				is there 				in the 				clinic all 				the time should 				be completely 				removed. There should 				not be 				any leakage. 				Cleanliness should 				have the first 				place in nature-cure. 				If the 				expenses go 				up on that 				account, let them.  I 				have taken deep 				thought about 				the clinic and 				am daily 				thinking about 				it. I 				am convinced 				that you 				should run 				it. It is better 				that we 				have a 				trust but 				that is 				a small thing. If 				a university is 				to come up 				it will be 				only from the 				clinic. There won’t 				be any 				university if 				this is 				entrusted to 				someone else. 				To leave 				this will mean giving up 				your vocation. 				In order 				to raise a 				university, you must 				go and see all        
 naturopaths, befriend them and try to get their co-operation. So long as this is not achieved, all is in vain. All things have come up in the world in this way. Money does not make universities.

    CHI. 	NIMU,  October 	5, 1945 
  	I received your letter. Manilal and Sushila also read it. Delhi will 	begin to have fine weather from this month. At such a time, I do not 	like it that she should be brought to Nagpur. Of course, ultimately, 	she will have to go there. Ramdas also does not wish to bring her 	over to Nagpur. Manilal and Sushila, too, are of the  same  view.  	My suggestion, with which Manilal and Sushila agree, is that you 	should go to Delhi. In your absence, Sushila will look after your 	home and take care of Ramdas and Kanam. And so, you will be ab1e to 	remain in Delhi without worrying about anything. Usha, too, may 	remain in Nagpur. Both of you may think over the matter and then 	write or wire to me so that Sushila can start from here. Neither of 	you should entertain the doubt that Sushila will not be willing to 	go there. I hope    
 Ramdas is all right. I am also well enough. There will be no need for Sushila to give up her treatment to go there. The treatment is such that she can give it up whenever she wishes.

255,"October 5, 1945",LETTER TO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU,"
        
 October 5, 1945
 CHI. JAWAHARLAL,
 I have long been intending to write to you but can do so only today. I have also been wondering whether I should write in English or Hindustani. In the end I have decided to write in Hindustani.
 I take first the sharp difference of opinion that has arisen between us. If such a difference really exists people should also know about it, for the work of swaraj will suffer if they are kept in the dark.  I have said that I fully stand by the kind of governance which I have described  in  Hind  Swarajlibtech_221_footnotelibtech_222_footnote.  It  is  not  just  a  way  of  speaking.  My experience has confirmed the truth of what I wrote in 1909libtech_223_footnotelibtech_224_footnote. If I were the only one left who believed in it, I would not be sorry. For I can only testify to the truth as I see it. I have not Hind Swaraj in front of me. It is better that I redraw the picture today in my own language. Then it would not matter to me whether or no the picture tallies with that of 1909libtech_225_footnotelibtech_226_footnote, nor should it to you. I do not have to establish what I had said before. What is worth knowing is only what I have to say today. I believe that if India, and through India the world, is to achieve real freedom, then sooner or later we shall have to go and live in the villages—in huts, not in palaces. Millions of people can never live in cities and palaces in comfort and peace. Nor can they do so by killing one another, that is, by resorting to violence and untruth. I have not the slightest doubt that, but for the pair, truth and non-violence, mankind will be doomed. We can have the vision of that truth and non-violence only in the simplicity of the villages. That simplicity
 
 resides in the spinning-wheel and what is implied by the spinning- wheel. It does not frighten me at all that the world seems to be going in the opposite direction. For the matter of that, when the moth approaches its doom it whirls round faster and faster till it is burnt up. It is possible that India will not be able to escape this moth-like circling. It is my duty to try, till my last breath, to save India and through it the world from such a fate. The sum and substance of what  I want to say is that the individual person should have control over the things that are necessary for the sustenance of life. If he cannot have such control the individual cannot survive. Ultimately, the world is made up only of individuals. If there were no drops there would be no ocean. This is only a rough and ready statement. There is nothing new in this.
 But even in Hind Swaraj I have not said all this. While I appre- ciate modern thought, I find that an ancient thing, considered in the light of this thought looks so sweet. You will not be able to understand me if you think that I am talking about the villages of today. My ideal village still exists only in my imagination. After all every  human being lives in the world of his own imagination. In this village of my dreams the villager will not be dull—he will be all awareness. He will not live like an animal in filth and darkness. Men and women will live in freedom, prepared to face the whole world. There will be no plague, no cholera and no smallpox. Nobody will be allowed to be idle or to wallow in luxury. Everyone will have to do body labour. Granting all this, I can still envisage a number of things that will have to be organized on a large scale. Perhaps there will even be railways and also post and telegraph offices. I do not know what things there will be or will not be. Nor am I bothered about it. If I can make sure of the essential thing, other things will follow in due course. But if I give up the essential thing, I give up everything.
 The other day, at the final day’s meeting of the Working Committee, we had taken a decision to the effect that the Working Committee would meet for two or three days to work out this very thing. I shall be happy if it meets. But even if it does not meet, I want that we two should understand each other fully. And this for two reasons. Our bond is not merely political. It is much deeper. I have no measure to fathom that depth. This bond can never be broken. I therefore want that we should understand each other thoroughly in politics as well. The second reason is that neither of us considers
 himself as worthless. We both live only for India’s freedom, and will be happy to die too for that freedom. We do not care for praise from any quarter. Praise or abuse are the same to us. They have no place in the mission of service. Though I aspire to live up to 125  years rendering service, I am nevertheless an old man, while you are comparatively young. That is why I have said that you are my heir.libtech_227_footnoteIt is only proper that I should at least understand my heir and my heir in turn should understand me. I shall then be at peace.
 One thing more. I had written to youlibtech_228_footnoteabout Kasturba Trust and Hindustani. You had said you would write after thinking things over. I find that your name is already figuring in the Hindustani Sabha. Nanavati reminded me that he had approached you and Maulana Saheb and that you had appended your signature. That was in 1942. That was long ago. You know where Hindustani stands today. If you still stand by that signature, I wish to get some work out of you in this regard. It will not involve much running about, but some work will be called for.
 The work of Kasturba Memorial Trust is rather complicated. I realize that if what I have said above is going to irk you or is irking you, you will not feel comfortable even in the Kasturba Trust.
 The last point concerns the sparks that are flying about in the conflict with Sarat Babu.libtech_229_footnotelibtech_230_footnoteI have been pained by the episode. I have been unable to trace it to its root. If what you have told me is all there is to it and nothing more remains to be said, then I do not have to inquire further. But if an explanation seems necessary, I very much want to hear it.
 If we have to meet to thrash out all these matters, then we should find time for a meeting.
 You are working very hard. I trust you are in good health and Indulibtech_231_footnoteis well.

 I understand about Kailas. If the Ashram has to bear  her expenses to this extent, we would be going beyond our limits. Because  I think we shall have to give a little in Nagpur, if not more. And I doubt very much whether she will learn anything there. But I don’t worry because you are there.

           DEAR 	SIR EVAN,             October 	10, 1945 
  	I am the Chairman of the All-India Spinners’ Association, a wholly 	philanthropic body of about 25 years’ standing, run solely in the 	interest of the millions of the poorest unemployed or partly 	unemployed women of India. In order further to popularize 	hand-spinning a rule was recently introduced at my instance to 	demand from the buyers of khadi a certain quantity of yarn in lieu 	of money. Since the inception of the Association, some time known as 	Khadi Board,over four crores have been distributed among spinners 	all over India. These include all Communities from among the poor 	village women. Now, I understand, licensing rules are being issued 	by Provincial Administrations requiring khadi shops to take out 	licences as if they were dealers in millmade cloth. Objection has 	also been taken to the price being partly demanded in hand-spun 	yarn. I am sure the Government do not intend to penalize khadi and 	thus the poor people. As this is an all-India matter, I venture to 	approach His Excellency in the hope of the impending wrong being 	redressed. I may add that the matter has been taken up by the 	Honorary Secretary      
 of the Association with the Provincial Administrations concerned.libtech_269_footnote

    MY 	DEAR JAIRAMDASBHAI,  October 	10, 1945 
  ... 	I read 	out the whole 	of your 	letter to Bapu. 	He says 	that the ban on 	sending yarn 	in large 	quantities to 	him was imposed 	because of the 	new rules preventing 	posting of yarn 	or cloth 	from one 	province to 	another and 	also in 	order to 	save postage. 	He says 	if you 	can get over the 	rules and 	expense and 	send the 	yarn— if 	everyone insists 	on this—to 	him through 	someone who happens 	to be coming 	his way 	you may do so. 	But he would 	prefer you to 	have the yarn woven 	into cloth 	and your 	proposals which are sound 	should be adopted. 	You may send 	the dhotis, 	etc., to him 	for his personal use 	when anyone can 	bring them. In 	regard to 	the signatures they 	cannot be 	had for less than Rs. 5 	each. Signature 	money can only go 	to the Harijan 	cause. Khadi auctioned or 	yarn or cloth donated at the Jayanti, all goes to the A. I. S. A.   	I hope I have made Bapu’s wishes clear....  I 	am not keen on goinglibtech_270_footnotebut Bapu feels I 	should go and take advantage of doing work by the way so to speak. 	Bapu is all right again, I am glad to say. Of course he gets tired 	easily. But this place admits of good massage and treatment for him 	as also more protection from visitors than most others and the 	climate is better than [that of] Sevagram in August, September and 	October. According to present plans he leaves for Sevagram on the 	19th and after 9 days there leaves for Bengal, arriving in Calcutta 	on November 2nd. But this depends on what progress Sardar makes this 	week. Up till now there is no real improvement in his case but Bapu 	is hopeful that he will improve if he stays on....

 October 10, 1945
 CHI. KISHORELAL,
 Today just after the prayers I read with care your article on decimal coinage. I liked it. Why did you take so long in sending it? Or did you send it and did I miss it by oversight? I was in Panchgani thenlibtech_272_footnoteand hardly looked at newspapers. At present also the situation is just the same. To say that I have carefully gone through the article does not mean that I have also checked up the calculations or that they are clear to me. Since you are so good at calculations I take it that the figures are correct. Suppose your figures are correct and your suggestions are very useful to the public, you cannot sit quiet after merely writing an article. If your health permits, pursue the matter yourself or discuss it with Narahari, Jajuji and Kumarappa. Vinoba also is an expert at figures. If he agrees, Jajuji or Narahari can go deep into the matter and correspond with Kodanda Rao. I am myself writing to him. I have written to K. T. Shahlibtech_273_footnote, Vaikunthlibtech_274_footnoteand Gagan- vihari and sent them copies of the article.
 Now about Jajuji. I don’t think we shall gain anything by sending him to the Assembly. He would become weak. Ours is a queer way of working and the people working there are even more queer. People ask for Jajuju and others but will not listen to them after placing them on the throne. Jajuji will be much more useful by remaining out of the Assembly.
Dada’s name is worth considering and perhaps he will be
 
 
 relieved of his family responsibilities when the time comes.
Sardar told me that you had written to him.
 I am not convinced by what you say about your health. And I am helpless because you are insisting exclusively on one thing. I cannot understand your insistence. But since it is backed by your peculiar line of thinking how can I counter it? If you were temperamentally like Sardar I would have sent for you for treatment here or done some such thing. I just do not believe that your constitution is collapsing from within and that it cannot be helped. I believe it can be set right by nature cure. I have said all this as I could not help it. If any of this appeals to you, please let me know so that I may think about the next step.

Your ideas are noble but the work will not progress on mere ideas. I 	did not like the scene I witnessed the day I went there.  Everyone 	was sentimental but they had no knowledge and no will for work. Try 	to expand the scope of the goshala. Till now there is no tannery 	there. I do not know if there is a good bull.  	Do you have a dairy expert? If there is one and if the existing 	institution itself becomes an ideal dairy, I shall be too glad and 	hope to have great results from it. A similar experiment is going on 	in Wardha under my supervision. I cannot of course cite any 	significant results. I realize that it is very difficult to attain 	perfection. I know of      
 no easy way of overcoming difficulties and perhaps I may never come across one. I hope you have understood the meaning of what I say.

  	I have your letter. I take little or no interest in the elections. 	Sometimes, however, I have to tender advice. Your letter I like and 	also 
 dislike. I like its frankness but the argument is  bad.libtech_299_footnotelibtech_300_footnoteI  want  every minority to be robust and independent in the full sense of the term. A Christian remains a full Indian because he cannot be otherwise and expects or wants no reward for remaining an Indian. Then the word ‘minority’ loses all its significance. I have put myself in the minorities’ position. I can, therefore, speak with frankness and even some authority. What does it matter, if older Christians cling to the Government and look up to it for crumbs? That will be the testing time for the younger ones. For time runs against the former and in favour of the latter.
 If you have understood and appreciated my argument, in your private talks too you will bear down the opposition of the older ones by being and remaining true to yourselves and the nation to which you belong.

        CHI. 	MRIDULA,     October 	15, 1945 
  	I have your resignation. I think you have acted wisely in tendering 	it. I know and I believe that in accepting the post of Joint 	Secretary your intention was to render wider service to the cause of 	women. Equally good is your motive in resigning because you  	realized and I also saw that by continuing in that post you would 	not be able to realize your ideal. There is temperamental 	incompatibility between Bapa and you. You tried to adjust but who 	can remove inherent differences? You saw that your method of working 	did not satisfy Bapa. He, on his part, also tried to adjust but with 	little success.  I could see that the difference was enormous. In my 	opinion neither of you is at fault. Very often such differences are 	unbridgeable. In these circumstances, the best thing is to work 	apart. Bapa was, and is still, ready to quit. But this is Bapa’s 	creation and Bapa is a seasoned hand in this kind of work. It would 	be difficult for me, I think, to carry this burden without him. It 	is Bapa’s wish and mine that all men should ultimately withdraw 	from the Samiti and the entire administration should be handed over 	to the sisters. That will bring it real credit. This effort will 	continue and none of us will rest on our oars till it succeeds. 	Success will not come early by Bapa’s leaving it or allowing us to 	quit. Hence I am allowing you to quit the Joint Secretaryship and am 	accepting your resignation. I know that I am not losing your 	services thereby. You are and will continue to be a    
 trustee. I am sure you will continue to work for the local Kasturba Nidhi committee of Gujarat; and you will also assist the Central Committee whenever it needs your help. Thus I am confident that you will not lag behind in serving the Committee even when you relinquish its Joint Secretaryship. Moreover, you should not forget that you have resigned from Secretaryship, not from trusteeship.

  	I have read your letter to Rajkumari. I must say your letter is 	unsatisfactory. That you are going to Denmark and that during your    
 absence the institution will remain closed should have been sufficient for the withdrawal of the application. Was it good or necessary to bring in the matter of conversion? When you and Esther came to me, it was, I think, common between us that conversion from one faith to another was needless and created heart-burning. One’s faith expands by removing the bad in it and absorbing the good and new from the others. You have every right to hold the opposite view. My point is simple. You had a decisive cause for withdrawing your application without raising an irrelevant issue.
 I hope you will have a good time in Denmark and will return hale and hearty.
Love.

         DEAR 	SISTER,     October 	16, 1945 
  	If you had written your article in ink, I myself would have read it 	earlier. But as it was in pencil, I could not read the whole article    
 though there is plenty of light in my room. Ultimately I made someone read it out. I know from personal experience that there is a lot of difference between reading something and hearing it  read.  Daily I make someone read out cuttings from newspapers and if and when I have time, I read them myself. Sometimes when a thing is re-read there is a striking change in my understanding. I feel this must be a common experience. Of course you have to realize yourself. I have mentioned this important, though irrelevant, thing because I thought it worth mentioning. I would be pleased if you accept that there is violence in writing in pencil things sent by post. The letters written in pencil fade away in course of time.
 I am sending back your article. Please note the changes I have made in what I could read myself. The changes are just from the point of view of language. The rest I find is quite all right. I am giving a gist of my experiences so as to make what I have said more clear.
 I saw the work done by teachers trained under Madame Montessori, and carefully observed the working of  the  Nursery School. Of course the things were foreign and the poor teacher had not digested what she had been taught. What to speak of the children? They could not even observe normal discipline. I am not criticising anyone. I have given the gist of my experience just for your information. Imbibe whatever you find useful and discard the rest. The conclusion I have drawn from this experience is that we shall be able to propagate scientific knowledge of child education only when our teachers are competent. They should have the will to become one with children. I am afraid I am not saying anything new in this. These things are certainly not beyond your range of experience but since I have come to know you and also love you I hope you will not find fault with me for saying the things you already know.

  	I showed it to Bapa. He returned my draft unchanged. He said: “I 	cannot think of making any changes in this. Do what you think 	proper. I have learnt about the resignation only today. But do what 	you think is correct.” So I am sending my draft as it is with my 	signature. But if you wish to make any changes, send it back to me 	with the changes. I shall look into the changes and incorporate them 	if I find them in order and then send it to the press.  	Now about Jog. Bapa says: “I stick to what I said. No one had 	sanctioned it. But if you can give the sanction for two months, you 	may as well make it for three months so that the matter is settled.” 	I would do as you wish. I shall make the sanction for three months 	if you so desire. It appears to me that Jog has written under your 	persuasion. So I take that what will fully satisfy you will also 	satisfy her. I understand that what you suggest is two months’ 	wages. So I shall arrange for sanction for only two months. I shall 	do about the matter as you want.

  	I have your letter. I remember to have written to you that I would 	let you accompany me during some part of my tour.libtech_326_footnoteMy view is that it would be convenient if you 	accompanied me in the Madras Presidency, for I am familiar with the 	work there. The work in Bengal and Assam is rather difficult. I 	don’t have a clear picture of it in my mind. I, therefore, don’t 	wish to take with me there anybody who is not specially needed. The 	date of my tour also has not been fixed. Perhaps I may go to Bengal 	only after November 21. Everything depends on Sardar’s health.  	I think your accepting money from the Rulers requires some 	consideration. It was your letter which made me think about this. 	Shouldn’t we ponder whether or not we can accept money  from 	Rulers who pay no attention at all to the welfare of their subjects? 	When the amount of Rs. 1,000 is received, I will credit it to  the 	account of the Harijan Sevak Sangh.  	So far I have no knowledge of its being received this time. I do not 	know if it has been received at the Sevagram Ashram.  	Do you think the States would give any protection to  the Harijans 	wherever they are oppressed? Concerning joint fruitparties for 	Harijans and caste Hindus, do you mean any caste Hindus or only 	reformers like you and me?  	Remind me again when you read about the date of my tour. Rajkumari 	has gone to Simla. From there she may perhaps have to go to England 	for a month. Sushilabehn and Manilal  have  gone  to Akola.

POONA,
 
    BHAI 	PROFULLA,  October 	18, 1945 
  	I  have  your  letter   and   telegram   about   Jawaharlalji.libtech_333_footnoteI   have understood the matter.  	Sudhir came yesterday. I have had long talks with Sudhir yesterday 	and today. I could not send a telegram about my decision. It would 	have been too long. So I am sending this letter. Sudhir must have 	sent you a brief telegram.libtech_334_footnote  	Taking everything into consideration I feel that at this stage you 	may announce this much: ‘Owing to unavoidable circums-tances 	Gandhiji cannot come to Calcutta on the 2nd November. As soon as the 	date is decided it will be announced. It is likely that he will come 	in the last week of November or thereabouts. His tour programme 	which has been published in the newspapers is also cancelled. But 	wherever he is likely to go, the organizers will be informed so that 	they can make some arrangements. No expen-diture of any kind should 	be incurred at this stage. Wherever he goes, his transport will have 	to be paid for, but that can be seen at that time only. Gandhiji has 	made it clear that, health permitting, he will try his best to go to 	all the places he wanted to visit. But consi-dering his age and 	health, it is obvious that in spite of his desire to visit as many 	places as possible he will be able to visit only a few of them.’  	You may publish this much. Now I shall tell you what I want to do. 	If possible I want to visit Midnapore,  Chittagong,  Dacca, 	Borkamta, Santiniketan and Assam. If any other place is left out, 	like Feni, I would like to visit that also. You can inform the  	local  organizers about my programme which all of you there may 	decide for me. Transport also would have to be arranged. Do not give 	anything to the Press yet. That can be done on my arrival. It takes 	a little time to make the preliminary arrangements. That is why I 	have suggested this. It is for you to work out what places I can 	easily visit. I 	don’t feel that it is necessary for me to let you know just now      
 who will be with me. If you want to suggest anything about this, you may do so.
 I would certainly like to meet the people who have already been to see me. If you want any more persons to meet me you may send for them. Maulana Saheb is there in Calcutta at present. You should not trouble him; but if he wants to suggest anything you should go to him and ask him about it.
 I do not want to get involved in addresses of welcome. Gift of any amount of self-spun yarn, or yarn spun by friends, will not be too much. My aim will be to convert it into khadi and distribute it there at the cheapest possible price. Any gift of money will be welcome, but no special effort should be made for it. It should be voluntary. The money will be used for some constructive work in Bengal. But please remember that this tour is not for the collection of either yarn  or money.
 I would of course like to meet Mr. Casey and try to secure from him whatever assistance can be had for the people. It has been my experience so far that wherever I go and settle down, my presence gives the poor and destitute a sense of comfort. If I can do even this much, I shall be satisfied.
 I do not want to get involved in the politics of Bengal. I have neither the desire nor the knowledge.
 Whatever you decide in this matter should be decided unanimously by all of you, rather than by majority opinion. This is not the kind of thing which should be settled by the majority. If anyone interested in my proposed visit does not like a particular thing,  I do not want to do that. There must be no quarrel over my visit. My dharma is to settle quarrels. Please give this letter or a copy of it to Satis Babu. My earnest wish is that even though you are two separate bodies, you should become of one mind before my arrival. You are both eminent disciples of the same guru, a great guru like P. C. Raylibtech_335_footnotelibtech_336_footnote. What I want is to see you both truly united in heart. Both of you are doing my work. Then why should there be any difference between the two of you? But in all this God’s grace is the main thing.

 October 18, 1945
 BHAI MANGALDAS PAKVASA,
 Many Provincial governments permit the sale of cloth under licences. They have now amended the terms. A copy of  the amendment introduced by the C. P. Government is enclosed. In my view a product like khadi cannot be, ought not to be, licensed. A leading counsel in South Africa with a flourishing practice had told me that one must proceed on the assumption that  every  tangible wrong had a remedy in law and seareh for it, assured that it would be found. This had appealed to me very much, and I had always relied on it in my work in South Africa and succeeded in finding the remedies. I believe the principle is true in India, too. I have not read all the laws, but I feel that a law which applies to a mill-owner worth millions cannot apply to khadi.
 If you see the definition of a ‘dealer’, you will observe that it must include ‘business’. There is no trace of ‘business’ in khadi, for all processes relating to it merely ensure a livelihood to those who make a living through khadi.
 I have alluded to this argument merely as a suggestion to you. You will also see that the Government is empowered to  grant exemption to anybody. This is not a matter of law, as yet. I draw your attention to it. You may write to Jajuji for any further information which you cannot get locally. What I want you to do is this. Consult anybody whom you wish to and then write to the Government  yourself, or request the counsel whom you consult to do so. If,  however, you feel that whatever representation is to be made should be addressed by Jajuji as Secretary, we shall do that. Send copies to Jajuji and me of any correspondence that you have. And if you decide to write to the Government directly from there, send the letter after showing the draft to me. I still cherish the belief that I may be able to suggest some improvements.
 We should write immediately to the Provincial Government or to the Central Government, whichever you decide. I have already addressedlibtech_347_footnotea communication to the Central Government as President of the Charkha Sangh. A copy is enclosed. I have even received an acknowledgement of the letter. The copy is only for your information for the present. We do not wish to give publicity to this matter in
 
 newspapers just now or let everybody know about it. Probably you know that by adopting such a procedure I had been able to save the Charkha Sangh during Linlithgow’s tenure. Let us see what happens this time.
 I am entrusting this important task to you relying on the assurance you have given to me, that you intend to use your ability and prestige as a lawyer, not for money but entirely for public service. And that is what you have been doing for some time. Isn’t that the best way for everybody to use their talents? If you want any further information, please write to me. The matter is urgent, since they have already started issuing licences.
 I forgot about one thing. Khadi is facing a special danger, namely, the U. P. Government’s objection to our practice  of demanding yarn worth some pice from the buyers for khadi worth every rupee. The objection seems to me ridiculous and harmful from every point of view. However, please consider along with the other issue whether such an objection can be sustained in law. In my view this is a secondary matter and can be easily dealt with. The chief thing is that khadi must not be considered as falling within the scope of the licensing law. We have even stores which sell less than 1,000 rupees worth of khadi every month. To require a licence for sale of khadi is to put a restraint over the production of khadi, i. e., over the poor.

  	Shri Jyotish Bose is a condemned prisoner with Shri Haridas Mitra 	and others. The condemned prisoner’s father came to me two    
 days ago and showed me his petition for mercy. If  Shri  Haridas Mitra’s sentence is commuted, as I hope it will, this one deserves commutation ipso facto. Shri Jyotish Bose is the son  of an uninfluential poor father. But I am sure that poverty will be considered no bar to commutation.
 I see from the legal papers that there are others of the batch awaiting execution. The times when the sentences were pronounced were those of war when calmness was at a discount. Now they are changed. The war is over. The condemned men have, no matter what the cause of delay was, survived the war. Will it be too much if I suggest a reconsideration of all such cases in the shape of commutation of death sentences? In my opinion, justice to be real justice requires extension of mercy to temper it.
 May I ask you please to put this letter before His Excellency for consideration?libtech_349_footnote

 October 19, 1945
 BHAI BHAVANIDAYAL,
 I have your letter. I am sorry to learn that you are not well. Get well soon. This is my hope as well as my wish.
 It is surprising that you who know me from childhood should still fail to understand fully or to make others understand what I am doing. Truly speaking, good work does not need anyone’s blessings because it is in itself a blessing. That is to say, its success lies in the work itself. Secondly, for what shall I send my blessings? There is no reason to doubt that your aunt may be greater than all the mahatmas in her field and perhaps she is. Moreover, she is certainly of an advanced age but it is my misfortune that I don’t know her. In such a situation how can a man like me send blessings to her? And where do  I count among so many titled men and other bigwigs, and, pray, why should I? When the rich take my blessings on some occasions you should take it that I know them and take service from them. Otherwise none of the rich come to me or can get anything from me. And what to say of the poor? They are mine and I am theirs. I am myself poor but if they get my blessings it is not going to appear  in  the  newspapers. So looking from all points of view, I cannot be a participant in your aunt’s memorial. Those who are in it do not know me; so they can only criticize me. What else can they do? If people like you can convince them with love, you may do so.
 What will you gain by writing to me except that I should waste my time in writing such long letters and give you the trouble of reading them even when you are not well? I shall have done my job if  I have been able to make you see the point and if I have not, I am helpless.

 There is room for disappointment in expectation. Moreover, it is a sin to entertain false hopes. What Manibehn says is clear. If you think that she is a sevika, that too of her ailing father, his secretary and aide, you may perhaps make changes in your article. If you find fault with her way of answering or her voice, one can only point out that you are much older. I don’t remember anything.

 Regarding your health I would like you to come here for treatment while I am here. But that requires enthusiasm on your part or detachment like Sardar’s. He has no faith in this system but still he is giving it a trial.

Why keep it in your heart? Since you have written so frankly, I also have an opportunity of saying something. Your sense of detachment should be sufficiently strong. Explain your doubts to Prafulla Babu and listen to what he says and if he disagrees, accept his advice. Haven’t I made it clear in the letter that I have sent through Sudhir that so long as you all do not decide unanimously and not by majority, it should not be considered as finally decided? Still, I shall go there and decide which places I shall visit and which I may not. I have stopped anything being sent to the newspapers. I think this solves all the problems.

 All men are like a brother or a father to you. If yours is an ideal mother she will also be a preceptor and guru. She will care for you and will find a husband for you. If your mother is not an ideal one any other person whom you have accepted as your mentor will take full care of you. It is possible you may yourself come across a person of your liking but that will be due to your previous birth and not because of a sudden infatuation.

412,"October 	21, 1945",LETTER TO BHULABHAI J. DESAI,"
     POONA,         October 	21, 1945 
  BHAI 	BHULABHAIlibtech_389_footnote,  	As it is difficult to decipher my handwriting, I am dictating this 	letter so that it can be written in a clear hand.  	Sardar and I keep receiving telegrams suggesting that  you  should 	be put up as a candidate for the Central Legislative Assembly. I 	myself have no interest in the elections. A durbar daily assembles 	round the Sardar, but I know nothing about it. Ordinarily he does 	not talk to me not do I ask him anything. I attend to my work and he 	attends to his. The only reason for our being together this time is 	his nature-care treatment. He does not have much faith in nature 	care while I have. An operation would be a very risky affair. No 	doctor except Dr. Deshmukh advises it. That is why he has put faith 	in me and is undergoing nature-cure treatment. I have, accordingly, 	brought him to Dr. Mehta for I have faith in him. My own knowledge 	of nature cure is superficial. I have given this introduction 	because I thought it necessary.  	If Sardar receives any suggestion regarding you, he puts it  before 	me. Since you have accepted my advice, I assume that you yourself 	are not at all keen o getting into the Central Assembly, and that, 	therefore, those who send the telegrams do not do so at your    
 instance. Some big people naturally desire your presence in the Assembly. If I were not there, perhaps Sardar would have yielded to the pressure. But I am firm, for I am acting as your well-wisher. I want a big service from you, if you can give it. I wish to see you as a people’s man. I don’t consider you an old man. Why shouldn’t you also live up to 125? If you do not aspire to live that long, as I do, please remember that I try to persuade everybody to have such as piration for the sake of service. And it is not that there is no strength or effort behind my aspiration. If there is non and my aspiration proves fruitless, I will accept that. I am not, therefore, afraid of death if  it should come today. But I will cherish my aspiration till my last breath, for I have to serve —I have not yet finished with service. There is a spirit of competition to serve which all of us should share.
 From this standpoint I suggest to you that you yourself should issue a graceful statement, thanking all those who are trying on your behalf, explaining that you do not wish to be a member of the Assembly at the moment and that you have been doing, and will continue to do, whatever service you can from outside, that if you live long enough and feel later that you should also enter the Legislature, you yourself will come forward and seek people’s votes.
 I like the work you are doing just now of defending the prisoners.libtech_390_footnotelibtech_391_footnoteIt will bring you credit. I also wish that like Jawaharlal and Sardar, and to a great extent Maulana Azad, you too should come into contact with the masses. Perhaps I should cite Rajendra Babu’s case as offering the best example. Rajendra Babu is sought after by Bihar, he himself does not go seeking the support of Bihar. I can cite other similar instances, too. But where is the need to do so for you? Even what I have written above seems to me too long, but I cannot restrain my Mohalibtech_392_footnotelibtech_393_footnote. If desire also could be described as sattvikalibtech_394_footnotelibtech_395_footnote, I am sure this desire of mine is that and, therefore, I need not hide it. I trust you are well and succeeding in your efforts.

413,"October 21, 1945",A NOTE,"
    
 POONA,
 October 21, 1945
 I have gone through this. I liked it. I would like to go a little further. Khadi is a symbol of truth and ahimsa. It should not subsist on the mercy of the Government. It will be a different thing altogether if khadi is adopted deliberately after its real strength is realized. The shortage of cloth will then be easily removed. We can even have swaraj by non-violent means and thereby bring credit to ourselves and to our Government. Sooner or later that will come but how soon it will come, depends on the public acceptance of the new plan. I do know that a time may come when we may even have to suspend the sale of khadi in our shops. Self-reliance is the only remedy.
 From that point of view Jajuji’s article is a preliminary and an essential move.

But one certainly becomes such by observing the vows. It 	seems you have not been able to see that constructive programme is 	included in the observance of the vows.     
 Now go through it again. A person who finds fault with most people, or with some of them, cannot see his own shortcomings. Don’t make this mistake.
 One becomes a leader not by making mistakes but by getting rid of one’s shortcomings and imbibing a leader’s qualities.

  	I have your postcard. It is not that I have not replied to your 	letter owing to lack of time, but since I have something new to say, 	there is no need to reply to your other questions. The new thing is 	that 
 till today you have considered public service as primary and have devoted to the family only whatever time was available after that. Now having heard everything from Akkalibtech_415_footnote, I feel that you are no longer in a position to do so. Naturally you have to take care of Akka and also look after your other daughters and manage their affairs. You have to support your wife. If you do not, who else will? So it is the duty of people like you to give primary importance to the family responsibilities and devote to public service only as much time as you can after that. One who shoulders the burden of the family as dharma also renders service. One must clearly distinguish between family responsibility and family enjoyment. You have long since given up indulgence. Why should I discuss these things at length? You should be able to understand them from what I have already said. It should be clear enough that if you do not abide by what I have said the result will be quite to the contrary of what it should be.
 I cannot say what I had in mind when I wrote “I cannot give” [answers to your other questions]. And what will you gain by thinking over it again and again? If I was short of time, I should have said that I would reply to the other questions some other time. At any rate, I was quite clear in my mind when I sent   a  letterlibtech_416_footnotethrough  Akka  that  I should tell you what according to me your dharma was without bothering you about other things. Now the question arises only if you are not able to understand and approve of my stand. You can discuss this letter with Vinoba and Kishorelal. Of course also with Dhotrelibtech_417_footnoteand other relatives there.

  	I had a postcard from Chi. Nilkanth yesterday saying that you wanted 	Arun to come to you with him. I told Arun about it. Kanu has the 	greatest influence over him. He and others also told him. But he 	remained stubborn. He says he will come with me. That means all of 	you will have to spend the Diwali without him. Put up with  his 	absence. I am sure you do not wish that I should send him against 	his will. With great difficulty he wrote the letter on the back of 	this last night. He has no interest at all in study, but has plenty 	in playing and cycling. Whatever is possible will have to be done 	only here. Arun himself is quite happy. He studies a little, but 	very little. For all this backwardness I hold you, his mother, most 	responsible, since I have always believed you to be wise. If Arun 	remains a dullard, I will surely regard you as stupid.  	May you all spend a happy Diwali. Reserve a share for us all in your 	happiness. “Us all” includes all of us here and the dumb, poor 	millions of India.

         CHI. 	GHANSHYAMDAS,    October 	26, 1945 
  	I have had Jehangir Patel’slibtech_439_footnotelibtech_440_footnoteletter. 	He also writes that only the school building would be suitable. 	There should be some more facilities there. There should also be 	provision for electricity  and water. Dinshaw suggests going 	straight into the school building when everything is ready. In that 	case it will take nine months. I favour moving at once into the 	sanatorium building and starting work there, and later shifting to 	the school building when it is ready. Whether this is possible or 	not has to be decided by you people. In the sanatorium building also 	more pipes will be required for water. Maybe, something will have to 	be done about electricity too. Water treatment requires plenty of 	water. I see some difficulty in taking the school building. If the 	school is to be housed there, it will be difficult to run two 	institutions in the same building. If my idea takes shape, even the 	present building may not be enough. For, my idea is that the poor 	also have to be admitted and I shall be interested in  running 	nature-cure clinics for them, too. It seems to me that from the 	school building it would also be possible to serve the village 	people as I have planned to do. Think over all this and let me know 	what you feel would be best to do. Let 	me also give you Sardar’s view. He believes that I should not    
 interest myself in this work to this extent. If Dinshaw  requires  financial help I should have it provided to him and then stop at it. In going further at the moment there is a risk of Dinshaw breaking down or my being disappointed and the great affection which Dinshaw is showing for me today coming to an end. I have no such fear. In my opinion Dinshaw can break down, but his affection for me cannot wane. I know that he had the same affection for me even when no question of money was involved and when I did not even know him. But Sardar understands human nature and he has too much consideration for me; so I think it is as well to place his view before you so that you may decide the question objectively.
 Please do not think that just because I have been given assurance about Nasik no other alternative should be considered. Nature-cure work is of great importance. If carried on well it can have far-reaching results the scope of which can hardly be envisaged today. It must also be considered to what extent Dinshaw can fit into this set-up. If you think it necessary to see me before taking any decision in the matter and if you can find some time, come and talk it over. But if the matter can be settled through correspondence, you need not come. In spite of my great interest in this work you should take it that I am acting in a detached way. If I am to live for 125 years, there is  also  this condition that my sense of objectivity, that is, non-attachment should increase day by day and approximate as much to perfection as is humanly possible. I do not know how this can happen or whether it will happen at all. Why should I even wish to know? Let me keep that ideal in view and do what I consider to be my duty. I know this much that it is difficult to reach that ideal. But my life has been spent in tackling difficult tasks.

 MY DEAR RAMACHANDRA RAO,
Yours of the 13th to hand.
  Bookletlibtech_445_footnotelibtech_446_footnoteon 	  health  is 	  still  undergoing 	  revision. 	  It was suspended 	after my premature 	discharge from jail and 	I never 	had the 	time for finishing 	it. When it 	is finished you 	will know of this 	new publication. 	You can certainly 	publish a 	translation. It 	will not be 	called a 	new edition. 	It will 	be, if 	it is ever published, 	a new 	thing altogether.  There 	are many 	claimants for 	service of 	labour. Unfortunately, 	Congress monopoly 	tacitly recognized 	 by  all  is broken. 	But if 	the Congress 	is challenged 	I suppose 	the Congress 	will say 	we are 	the only real servants 	of labour. 	Who will 	establish the claim 	finally is in the 	womb of 	time. My 	participation in 	the affairs 	of the Working 	Committee is very 	slight and, 	I fancy, 	growing slighter. 	Therefore, don’t 	expect me to do anything 	in the 	matter of 	the flag 	designed by you.  SWEEPERS. 	You and a few others may 	recognize my claim to be the first sweeper, but I will cut a sorry 	figure in a sweepers’ conference. 	The so-called sweepers 	will themselves repudiate my claim as many 	do. My 	sympathy will 	be with them 	in such repudiation. 	The fortunate position 	of a self-styled man, however, 	is that he does not 	require any outside 	recognition of a style adopted by himself. Therefore, I must not 	bear the burden 	of having 	the conference 	even when the choice 	of the venue is left to 	me. What is more, I have neither the time nor the wish to carry 	more burdens than 	I have. 	You should 	therefore go on without 	counting on 	my service even 	in the way of a message.  Cultivate 	the belief 	that every bonafide 	service carries with 	it its own recognition. 
 
 
 
  MATERNITY 	HOME. 	Are you not principally 	dependent upon 	Government grant 	and recognition? The 	record you mention 	is certainly 	very good but it 	loses in 	public dignity and 	value. No 	Gov- ernment or 	Government-aided 	institution suffers for 	want of 	funds. All 	are crowded, some 	even to suffocation. 	Whether they really 	serve the 	needy poor is 	a separate question. 	This criticism is 	independent of 	the fact that I have 	to ask 	you to be merciful 	and excuse 	me from 	the obligation you 	seek to 	impose on 	me. If 	I do succeed 	in visiting Madras 	for the Hindustani 	Prachar Sabha, I 	must ask friends who 	know me to extend to 	me their co-operation 	by imposing upon 	themselves restraint in the way of saving me from further burdens.  	“UPFROM 	SLAVERY”: 	I would 	love to write 	a line 	on this. 	But seeing 	that you have waited 	all these years I 	would ask you to 	wait a 	little longer and 	remind me 	when I 	have settled 	down after 	the tours 	I have 	in mind.

 DEAR MADAM,
 I have just received your letter of 20th September, and I have devoured almost every line of the enclosure to your letter. Miss Slade whom we know here as Mirabai only, as she desires to be known, is in a basin of the Himalayas which she adores and loves. It is near Hardwar, a celebrated place of pilgrimage, through which the mighty Ganges flows down.
 Your Green Cross scheme appeals to me forcibly, not that there is anything new in it for me. Your resolution is also brief and to the point, and therefore is a temptation and invitation for me to sign. But I must resist the temptation. The Green Cross Society will, I  hope, forgive me for the resistance. It will do so readily if it appreciates the fact that some, among whom I count myself, render greater help by refraining from signing anything like your resolution but working silently and probably effectively.
 Though I refrain from sending you my signature I will ask you, if you at all can, to keep me in touch with your activities from time to time. It may interest and even please you to know that I have enforced in  my  own  life  now  for  years  your  ‘ten   don’ts’libtech_457_footnoteandinvited   my neighbours to do likewise for I have long believed that there is a ‘spirit in the wood’, using the word ‘wood’ in a double sense.

 Not for publication	NATURE CURE CLINIC, 6 TODIWALA ROAD,
 POONA,
 October 28, 1945
 DEAR MASCARENE,
 In continuation of the receipt of your resolution, you will not expect me to express any opinion because just now I have, so far as it is possible, steeled my heart against any expression of opinion. I have not studied the question of primary education in Travancore so as to satisfy myself, and I observe that many persons of note have expressed emphatic views one way or the other. I do not feel called upon to say anything.
 Why did you drag my sister and her daughter ? My sister is wholly illiterate. Her daughter can with difficulty read or write something. But neither takes any interest in public matters. It is fraud upon the public to put such ignorant persons on the platform and make them repeat things parrot-like, leading the public to believe that some good work has been done.
 I felt sorry when I first heard that my sister had been dragged out of her merited obscurity in which she was happy and contented. She has now come to me being on her way back to Rajkot. She tells me that she had not the slightest intention of going to a meeting or sending her daughter. She allowed herself to be tempted to go to Rameshwaram as a point of pilgrimage. She had intended also to remain obscure and not let the people know that she was my sister. If she had asked me I would have dissuaded her even from going to Rameshwaram, for I have no faith in these pilgrimages except under certain conditions. But what is done cannot be undone. I would how- ever like you to give me your version of the story, so that I can have full facts enabling me to come to a right judgment, for I do not want to do yo any injustice by making up my mind on insufficient data. Please therefore enlighten me. And who was the party who wrote out the speech that my sister’s daughter read without understanding it?
 Yours,
 BAPU

 October 28, 1945
 BHAI DAHYALAL,
 Don’t be angry with me but have a hearty laugh. I don’t know who told me or where I read it or what happened but somehow I had the illusion that you had died. Later one day when I saw Kishorelal revising your translation of the Gita, I came to know that you were alive and I was happy about it. But I forgot about this and thought you were dead. Meanwhile yesterday your letter came and now this won’t leave my mind. So now you have to live long. But l know that you may live beyond me, that is, you may live for more than 125 years, and yet will remain what you are now. Isn’t that as good as being dead even when alive? This is the impression I have got after reading your letter.
 There is nothing new in what you have said about the  five things. Of course, there is some truth in it but according to me it is so full of ignorance that I have not found any one of them useful. Your last sentence is: “If there is any service that I can do, do order me.” How incorrect this sentence is! I did order you to do a lot of service and what did I get from it? What could the country achieve or what benefit did you get? Think over the other four things in the same way. There is no need for a reply and this should not be published on anyaccount. I have written this just to humour you in the hope that it may open your eyes one day. If any time you are able to understand the hidden meaning behind it I would think it is better than getting your reply and would consider your living meaningful.

 The question of her salary does not arise at the moment. The thing is we have to see whether we can have her as Joint Secretary with Sucheta, and whether she can stay in Bajajwadi. We have also to find out whether Sucheta will agree to have a Joint Secretary. If you appr- ove of these suggestions, then we shall have to consult Sucheta. If you concur, I shall refer the matter to her. Please let me have your reply.

  	In continuation of my letterlibtech_465_footnotelibtech_466_footnoteof 	October 10, 1945, about khadi being licensed, may I add that the 	Privy Council had to consider the question of exempting the A.I.S.A. 	from the income tax. The case is reported in A. I. R. 1944 Privy 	Council at p. 88. His Excellency’s predecessor had at my request 	ordered that the collection of the tax be suspended, pending 	decision of the Privy  Council.libtech_467_footnotelibtech_468_footnoteIt 	 reversed  the decision of the Bombay High Court and expressed the 	opinion that the primary object of the Association is the relief of 	the poor, that its objects include the advancement of other purposes 	of general public utility and that the making of a commercial or 	private profit is not the purpose of the Association. On these 	grounds they came to the conclusion that the Association is a 	charitable and philanthropic body and entitled to exemption from 	tax. Can khadi manufactured and sold on behalf of the 	manufacturers—the profits, if any, going to the hand-spinners and 	handloom-weavers—be classed  with  mill-cloth under the 	Anti-Profiteering and Hoarding Regulations? In my humbleopinion, it 	should be wholly exempt from such control, if the meagre earnings of 	the poor concerned are not to be taxed.  Yours sincerely,  M. K.

But so 	long as 	the millions 	of India 	do not 	take to 	it, Parliamentary 	programme will remain as 	a supplement.

Any man or 	woman above 	the age of sixteen 	can become 	a Congress 	worker, provided he or 	she is 	a habitual 	wearer of khadi 	certified by the 	A.I.S.A. and 	pays a 	monthly fee 	of 1,920 	rounds of handspun 	yarn to 	the Congress. 	The spinners 	should be 	conversant with 	all the processes from 	picking cotton pods 	from the 	field to 	the point of 	making slivers and producing 	yarn. They should 	also know how to 	put a 	spinning-wheel in order.  The 	Congress shall make 	it a 	point of 	duty to 	penetrate the 	7,00,000 villages of 	India. At 	least one 	Congress worker shall 	stay in 	each village and 	do the following: 
  He 	shall come 	in personal 	contact with every 	villager and keep 	a list 	of their 	names along with those of 	the other 	members of their families.

He shall keep a record of his work from day to day.  It 	is possible that 	obstacles might be 	placed in 	his way by the 	Government or by the 	villagers themselves. He shall fight 	all difficulties 	by truthful 	and non-violent 	action even though he 	might perish 	in the attempt.  He 	shall organize the 	villages so as to make 	them self- contained 	and self-supporting 	through their 	agriculture and 	handicrafts, treating 	the manufacture 	of Khadi as 	the centre, in accordance 	with the 	lines laid down by 	the A.I.S.A., 	A.I.V.I.A. and the 	Goseva Sangh.

 [On or after October 29, 1945]libtech_481_footnoteI am becoming more and more convinced that the four-anna membership should go. The membership of the Congress should be
 forty crores, the whole of the population, no matter to what sect, religion or province or state or the so-called independent possessions  a particular individual belongs. The members have an equal right with all to service by the Congress organization. These  forty  crore members will exercise no privilege by reason of their recognition as such by the Congress.
 The organization will be worked by those who are habitual wearers of khaddar one year before the date of commencement, who have renounced untouchability in all its forms and who are not dealers in foreign cloth or intoxicants, who have full belief in the constructive programme of the Congress and who are prepared and willing to do work referred to in Schedule A hereto and who have passed a  probation period of six months in doing that work.

Just now I am 	not writing a letter of thanks. I don’t approve of the condition 	laid down by him. How can we have a trust for such a small amount? 	Why does he not have faith in an institution like the Harijan Sevak 	Sangh? And why all this fuss about making a trust? He can give the 	shares to Harijan Sevak Sangh on condition that the money received 	from the shares will be utilized as decided by the Sangh for the 	Harijans of Sorath. I also believe that if we can get more money by 	selling the 
 shares, the Sangh should have the right to do so. Think over this and discuss this with Tryambaklal if you wish to. You can convey to Bapa my opinion about this. Come to Madras when I reach there.

    CHI 	MRIDULA,  October 	31, 1945 
  	I have your letter. You have laboured very hard. What for ? With me 	you could have been brief because I do not any more have to try 
 and understand you. Or do I have to understand you further ? I hope  I can understand from your slightest hint.
 There is one thing you must do. What can there be personal with people like us ? Are you any more an individual ? If you continue to be an individual, it is not for writing personal things, but to preserve your individuality, which is done only when you reduce yourself to a zero and remain a zero. If you do not know this, then follow my exeprience if you can. Where there is ‘I’, there is individuality. It is only when ‘I’ is eliminated, that individuality ceases to exist. Take the letter ‘I’ of the English alphabet. So long as it is straight, it appears like a scare-crow. If it wants to efface itself and realize its individuality  it must turn itself into a cipher. This is philosophy. But you will see what I mean.
 I can understand your views about Bapa. Our experiences with him have been different. Only time will show whose experience is right. I am under no misconception that my experience being longer is right and your experience being shorter is worng. I know that even a long experience can be wrong. We shall weigh our experiences on the scales of time.
 Kanu agrees that what I have written to the Kasturba Nidhi about Bapa is correct, because Thakkar Bapa was instrumental in this. Had he not involved himself, the matter would not have gone any further. And Narandas is always clinging to him. He would like to continue to work through him as before and be satisfied. His idea assumed the gigantic size it did only after Thakkar Bapa joined in. Afterwards others too played a major role. That in my opinion is a remarkable thing about Bapa. He starts something and lets someone else take the credit. He has shortcomings, no doubt. Who does not have them ? But in my view, his faults have become insignificant in the face of his good qualities. I wish you too would recognize this some day.
 I am writing to Bapa to pay Lila Jog for three months. Now I shall be able to find some time to send my letter to the newspapers.

THE DAYlibtech_491_footnote","
    
 July 17, 1945
 A man of the world can as little comprehend the universe as a fish living in the ocean can fathom its depths.
 July 18, 1945
Not to do evil is the only true law of life, says Guru Teg
 July 19, 1945
Life is unreal, death is real and certain. —Nanak
 July 20, 1945
 Truth can be found by searching within, never through argument or disputation. It is just the same if for ‘Truth’ one reads ‘God’.
 July 21, 1945
 Nanak says: “God dwells in every human heart, and so every heart is a temple of God.”
 July 22, 1945
If God resides in every heart, then who dare hate whom?
 July 23, 1945
 Nanak says: “If we obey the law of God, we then need no man-made laws.”
 July 24, 1945
 Nanak says: “God has ordained that all of us in this world itself are one family and each of us has to live for others,”
 July 25, 1945
 The darkness of egoism is more impenetrable than darkness itself.
 
 
 July 26, 1945
 How shall we dispel this darkness of egoism? By the light of uttermost humility.
 July 27, 1945
 Sorrow is but another aspect of joy. Hence the one invariably follows the other.
 July 28, 1945
 Just as joy and sorrow are a pair that follow each other, in succession, so is the case with all things in life. Consequently, to have real peace of mind, we must rise above such pairs of opposites.
 July 29, 1945
 How can he who realizes not the true value of the Self, nor is able to protect it, protect anything else in life?
 July 30, 1945
 Even one word, if true, is enough. Untrue words, however many, are worth nothing.
 July 31, 1945
 The power of a true word is such that it leads one from selfishness to selflessness.
 August 1, 1945
 He alone lives in whose heart dwells Rama (God) and who is ever aware of such presence.
 August 2, 1945 Real knowledge cannot be acquired by mere reading of the scriptures. Indeed, it is difficult of attainment without the practice of
virtue.
 August 3, 1945
 One can never find Truth if one is not  wide  awake  every moment of one’s life.
 August 4, 1945
 There can be no such thing as rights for a satyagrahi. For him there is only one right—the right to serve.
 August 5, 1945
 Therefore, a satyagrahi will never seek rights; these will come to him unsought.
 August 6, 1945
 Even one drop of the poison of untruth will poison the entire milk-ocean of Truth.
 
 August 7, 1945
 Nanak says: “Man is born of woman as woman is born  of man.” Then, why is it that we find sexual immorality in the world?
 August 8, 1945 Nanak lay in the open under the sky. A  kind-hearted householder   suggested   to   him,   “There   is  a   beautiful dharmsala
 nearby. Why not go there?” Nanak replied: “The whole earth is my
dharmsala and the sky is its roof.”
 August 9, 1945
 Nanak says: “The craving for happiness is a  veritable disease.
Sorrow or suffering is its remedy.”
 August 10, 1945
 Says Nanak again: “Whatever you give away is yours; whatever you keep is not yours.”
 August 11, 1945
 Whatever we take, we are snatching from the mouths of others. Therefore, whenever we acquire anything, let us see that it is really needed and that our wants are as few as possible.
 August 12, 1945
 Nanak says: “He who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow and shares with others what he so earns, can be called truly honest.”
 August 13, 1945
 Nanak says: “The more one indulges oneself,  the  more unhappy one becomes.”
 August 14, 1945 St. Catherine of Italy had no money with her. She had only a  cloak which she was wearing. A destitute asked for it and she gave it
away.  Someone,  thereupon,  asked   her:   “How   will  you   go about
 now?” She replied: “The raiment of love will cover me far more securely than the cloak.”
 August 15, 1945
 Money alone can keep memory green—how much harm this false notion has done! This thought occurs to me today on the anniversary of Mahadev [Desai].
 August 16, 1945 Nanak says: “Dreams are evidence of the fact that the atma  (soul) uses the senses as its instruments. But it is only when the atma
 keeps the senses under control that they become its instruments, and the atma then becomes ripe for union with the Paramatma.”
 August 17, 1945
 The pangs of hunger are not relieved by filling the stomach. They can be overcome by taking a limited quantity of food, like medicine, and remaining content with it.
 August 18, 1945
Fear vanishes only with the annihilation of the ego.
 August 19, 1945
 It is an ordeal nowadays to read the newspapers. They do not give correct news. Nothing would be lost by not reading them.
 August 20, 1945
 It is as difficult to make the impossible possible, as it is easy to make the possible impossible.
   What seems impossible 	is not always really so.  August 	21, 1945   August 	22, 1945 
 One 	person has God on his side; millions have Satan on theirs. Must, 	therefore, one fear the millions?  August 	23, 1945  	Supposing God is on the side of both, then who should fear whom?  August 	24, 1945 He 	who remembers God can afford to forget everything else.  August 	25, 1945  	He who remembers everything else but forgets God, really remembers 	nothing. 
   He who forgets God, 	forgets himself.  August 	26, 1945   August 	27, 1945 
  	If there is a soul, then surely the Supreme Soul (God), too, exists.  August 	28, 1945  	Because    of  our   physical	limitations,	we   cannot	have	a 	conception of the existence of God. 
 August 29, 1945 How can one believe in Truth if one has no belief  in nonviolence? If non-violence is not put into practice, Truth, too,
cannot be.
 August 30, 1945 Why would one who is capable of violence for gaining his ends,
hesitate to resort to untruth in both speech and action?
 August 31, 1945 There are some things which a man does by word of mouth,  some by observing silence, and yet others by action. If all that he does
is informed with knowledge, it is action indeed.
 September 1, 1945
 Never should we make the mistake of imagining that a wrong can be classified as ‘big’ or ‘small’.
 September 2, 1945
 One man commits a theft, another aids and abets it, while the third only harbours the intention to commit it. All the  three are thieves.
 September 3, 1945
 ‘What I do is a minor lapse; what others do are major lapses’— one who thinks like this lives in abysmal ignorance.
 September 4, 1945
 He who does something wrong out of a false sense of shame is guilty of a twofold wrong and will not be able to stand up before God.
 September 5, 1945
 He who thinks, speaks and acts with God as his witness, will never feel ashamed of doing the right thing.
 September 6, 1945
 A man who believes whole-heartedly in something, even if it be absolutely improper, for him it shall be right and proper.
 September 7, 1945
He who doubts the existence of God perishes.
 September 8, 1945
He who denies the existence of God denies his own.
 September 9, 1945
 A man who behaves like a beast is worse than  the  beast; bestiality is natural for the beast, not so for the man.
 September 10, 1945
 Woman is not helpless. She must never regard herself as weaker than man. She should not, therefore, beg for any man’s mercy, nor depend on him.
 September 11, 1945 Everyone, prince or pauper, is the guardian of his own dharma.
What is there to grieve or rejoice in this?
 September 12, 1945
 How strange that a man very often does not know who is a friend and who is a foe!
 September 13, 1945

 When a man gives way to anger, he only harms himself. The truth of this is borne out by daily experience.
 September 16, 1945
 Life becomes perpetually renewed every day. This knowledge should be helpful in uplifting us.
 September 17, 1945
 Happiness eludes us if we run after it. In fact happiness comes only from within. It is not a commodity to be bought from outside.
 September 18, 1945 It is a moot point as to how far a man should go with his comrades when he knows that they really no longer walk with him in
spirit.
 September 19, 1945
 He alone can be said to have conquered anger who is not angry even when there is a cause for anger.
 September 20, 1945 Conquest of anger does not mean that anger is not outwardly manifest while the heart is full of it. Deliberately casting out anger
root and branch, constitutes real conquest.
 September 21, 1945
 Indigestion, etc., are not the only causes of fever. Anger, too, can bring it on.

 A poet has said that a man without knowledge is like an animal.
What is that knowledge?
 October 1, 1945
 Knowledge is that alone which enables a man to know himself.
In other words, knowledge means self-realization.
 October 2, 1945 “Kind and generous though [the man of God] is to the sorrow-stricken, his mind is not touched with pride.” If it is God who

  	How can that be religion which cannot be put to use in one’s daily 	life?  October 	5, 1945  	By donning the garb of religion, vice does not become virtue nor 	does a wrong cease to be wrong.

  	It is easy to instruct an uneducated person, but who can carry 	understanding to a man of little learning?  October 	10, 1945  	He who knows no rules and follows none just cannot  be  a servant of 	the people.  October 	11, 1945  	One test of non-attachment is that a man, on retiring to bed with 	Ramanama on his lips, falls asleep in a moment.  October 12, 1945 Narasinha Mehta 	says: “To say ‘I do this’ and ‘I do that’ is the height of 	ignorance.” The key to non-attachment lies in the contemplation 	of this truth.

October 	14, 1945  	What greater meanness can there be than to seek out our good points 	and praise them to others?

 The objects of the senses come and go. The point to remember is that when they leave us, we feel miserable; but when we ourselves renounce them, we feel happy and joyful.

 To speak or not to speak—when that is the question, silence should take the place of speech.

 Religion does not consist in eating this food or eschewing that but only in the realization of God within oneself.
 October 27, 1945 Religion is not religion if it expects others to follow it. For example, the religion of ahimsa (non-violence) can manifest itself
only in the face of himsa (violence).

These days while 	I spin I have a friend read out to me some book which I think is 	worth reading. I am disappointed with your book. From what you had 	said I had expected that I would learn something new from it and at 	the same time some light would be thrown on the Hindu-Muslim 	question. Right from my childhood I have lived with Muslims and when 	I went to London Providence placed me in close association with 	Christians, Muslims and Parsis. Hindus of course were there. I came 	into contact with the intellectuals among them and that is how I 	read the holy books of all the four religions. I came to the 	conclusion that we could know the true facts about any religion only 	after reading its sacred books. I also read quite a few criticisms 	of them. I can say that I have also read the Muslim critics you 	mention in your letter. I had a talk with Muslims in South Africa 	about those books and also with an Englishman who had become Muslim. 	After coming here I read the works of Maulana Shibli. As a result I 	have realized that every religion contains both truth and untruth. 	The root     
 of all religions is one and it is pure and all of them have sprung from the same source, hence all are equal. This equality of all religions has been included by Vinoba among the eleven vows in a Marathi sloka, which is daily recited in the prayers.

 As it is, the letter has become quite long but since you have taken so much trouble and have also sent to me extra copies of your book, I felt I should atleast let you know my stand.
 I do not wish to argue with you. I have an answer to what you have suggested but I see no need to give it here. I therefore think that what I have said is enough.

MY DEAR BHARATAN,
I had your letter yesterday.
 You have given a cautious and judicious opinion on Bhailal’slibtech_521_footnoteproject. That is not what I wanted exactly from you. Did I tell you that I lent him your booklibtech_522_footnotein typescript, which you gave me to read for my foreword, and he cock-suredly told me that his scheme was exactly in conformity with your thesis? I said to him, and I repeat it now, that if I have understood your thesis correctly, his project is quite contrary to the letter and the spirit of your thesis. The rule of thumb that I applied was to know whether his scheme would succeed if it was multiplied to the extent of covering 700,000 villages. And my answer was it could not succeed within a measurable distance of time. This fundamental objection is apart from the fact that he, a tried engineer and therefore an accurate man, has dared to build his scheme largely on his calculation that people will do this and that and the other thing will come true. If what I have said is true and really flows from your book, as it does from my instinctive belief, you have to say so in black and white. If my argument is sound, the way to amend your opinion is to supplement what you have given already by adding that, according to your book as interpreted by you, the project is bound to fail in terms of the millions, and is likely to fail even within the limited compass, because he has built largely upon speculations, a thing which a tried engineer should never do. Did you also notice that his project contemplates a milllibtech_523_footnotesplit up into fragments, owned by the villagers or one intelligent villager? Just think what it means. It must resolve itself into one gigantic State-owned mill or mills centrally situated. In other words, 700,000 villages must be converted into 700 or 70 cities. In still other words, a large portion of the population must die of starvation, famine and the like or be cut to pieces by the sword or
 
 blown up by gunpowder.
Love.

  	I think I have told you that I observe silence while spinning. I do 	listen, though not to what people say. Valjibhai therefore reads 	things to me. In this manner I heard the whole of your speech at the 	Hindi   Sahitya   Sammelanlibtech_524_footnotelibtech_525_footnote.   I   liked   what  you   said   regarding   my 	resignation.libtech_526_footnotelibtech_527_footnoteI was glad, too, that you had firmly expressed your 	views regarding the national language. But I feel that what you have 	said about writers is not correct. I would let the thing pass if the 	views expressed were not harmful. If I have not heard right, please 	correct me. I have understood your view to be this: that if a writer 	can make his art interesting he has fulfilled himself. It has always 	seemed to me  a terrible thought that the end of art is for it to be 	made interesting. Leaving aside debauchery, even hypocrisy, violence 	and untruth can easily be made interesting. Would such writing be 	called art? On your recommendation I read  Prithivivallabhlibtech_528_footnotelibtech_529_footnote. According to me it owes its popularity not to the 	interest it sustains but to the meaning it contains. Besides, you 	have beautifully blended the beautiful languages descended from 	Sanskrit. But, as you have not been able to forget that historylibtech_530_footnotelibtech_531_footnote, can you, as a historian, forget the whole of Muslim 	history? Even if you can do so, can you make the whole of India 	forget it? Can you reverse the flow of water and make it go upward? 	After the British       
 have left, will it be possible to wipe all the consequences of the British connection off history?
 I have placed these two ideas before you with some hesitation, for I do not regard myself either as an expert on art or as a student of history. I, however, felt it was my duty to place before you the experience I have gained as, with my eyes open, I have wandered around the world. I realize, of course, that the principle which I have followed in this very letter in welcoming your views regarding the national language might equally well apply to your ideas on these two subjects.
 I liked your Press statement correcting the article which appeared in The Chronicle. I had been considering asking you about it, when I read your reply. What is this confusion regarding Jawaharlal’s letter? Or is it just a concoction?

527,"November 2, 1945",LETTER TO NARAHARI D. PARIKH,"
    
 November 2, 1945
 CHI. NARAHARI,
 Your questions are very good. This much is clear to me: whether public institutions have members of different religious persuasions or not, members belonging to the majority communities cannot celebrate their festivals in a manner which would hurt the religious sentiments of others. The Ganapati festival, and such others, are entirely of a political character and have nothing to do with religion. We cannot, therefore, celebrate them. But celebrations which are part of religious practice must be observed. For instance, in the Ashram Imam Saheb used to give, at my instance and request, the call to the faithful and we used to pray. The call is an essential practice in Islam. It is believed to be superior to the Church bell of the Christians. I think I have now answered your question regarding public institutions. If I have left out any point, please ask again.
 It is not easy to answer the question what should be done now regarding Hindu practices. It is very easy for me to describe what I myself do. And I am also quite clear in my mind about  the  correctness of what I do. But I am not so clear how far the Hindu community should go or which reforms to advocate even in the face
 of opposition from it. Probably Kishorelal remembers—as I do, if I am not imagining it—that he had once suggested the omission from our prayers of the verses referring to Ganapati, Saraswati and the Earth. I could not accept this. I know that the form of Saraswati described in the verse is purely imaginary. The Ganapati also is an imaginary figure and stands merely for “Aum”. But the  popular beliefs about both take the descriptions literally; hence we have the images of Saraswati and Ganapati. If, therefore, we were to eliminate all these practices, Hinduism would be transformed into something quite different; it would, you might say, take the form of the Arya Samaj. There is much in the Arya Samaj that I love, but I just cannot accept Satyarthaprakash as scripture. Dayananda Saraswati was  a great man and he believed in what he preached. He did, therefore, make an impact. Hinduism, it seems to me, is already assimilating all that is good in the Arya Samaj, and this is the distinctive feature of Hinduism. I do not wish to go, or take you, into still deeper waters just now. If I am destined to live up to 125 years or for many more years still and if my non-attachment becomes as deep as I wish it to become, my views will become clearer and firmer and I will also find a language that appeals to the heart. Till that time arrives, be content with this prosaic explanation that I have given. I have of course always expressed, and will continue to express, random views from time to time as occasion demands. And this will some day lead—if it is so destined—to perfect clearness. At present my attitude is,  neti, netilibtech_532_footnotelibtech_533_footnote. You may derive what comfort you can from this. I am unhappy that I am not able to answer your questions as clearly as you have put them.
I have stated my view regarding the Ganapati festival. I will add
this:
 Wherever 	there is a 	Ganapati temple, the 	arati, 	etc., should 
 continue to be performed for the present. There is room for reform in the arati and the ceremonial. The arati as it is performed at present is crude. There is no music in it. It can easily be made musical and sweet to the ear. The ceremonial also can be made more solemn by employing a better priest.
  There 	is no religion 	at all 	in the 	Dussehra celebration. 	Its only 	sanction is 	custom. I 	have always been opposed 	to it since 	my childhood. 	Even if we wish to equip 	the people 	with arms, the  Dussehra 	celebration has no 	meaning. Instead of 	worship of 	arms, the 	people, including even children, should be taught the use of arms, as is 
 
 
 done in the West.
  Plying 	the charkha 	on the 	Charkha Jayanti Day 	amounts to 	ceremonial worship of 	it. To 	introduce into 	it a 	ritual is 	to bring the 	charkha into 	disrepute. If 	you ask me 	why, when they spin, I 	permit them 	to have 	a lamp 	with ghee during broad 	daylight, my answer 	will be 	that in 	a large 	measure it is due 	to my sense 	of tolerance, 	also to 	my weakness. 	I have 	always opposed the 	ceremonial worship of 	the Gita 	or the 	manner in 	which Gita 	Jayanti is 	celebrated at 	present. I 	have also forbidden 	the composing 	of a 	hymn in 	praise of 	the Gita 	to be 	recited on 	the Gita Jayanti Day.  I 	do not 	approve of any leader’s 	photograph being worshipped 	or of arati 	being performed 	in front 	of it, 	but I have 	not always 	opposed these things publicly though I 	did oppose 	them in 	my mind. 	Since such worship of 	human beings 	runs in the blood 	of Hindus, 	I have 	remained indifferent to 	them. In 	this matter I 	am the 	greatest culprit, as 	it is the worship 	of my image 	that has become 	most widespread. 	Since it 	cannot be 	prevented, do 	what I 	will, I 	derived a 	kind of 	false consolation 	when the worship of 	other leaders 	 also started. This, of 	course, does 	not mitigate my 	guilt. It 	is very difficult 	to say where 	this thing will take us. 	There is 	some basis of 	truth in 	this practice, namely, 	that man himself 	being, in a sense, 	an image, 	he will 	always remain an 	image-worshipper. The 	forms of such 	worship will 	vary for different 	faiths, but 	in essence the thing 	remains image- 	worship. You may be sure I am opposed to the practice of inviting 
 Brahmins and breaking a coconut at a foundation-stone-laying. And yet I have tolerated this. But since the time I learnt to regard all of us as belonging to one class, namely, the Atishudras, all these rituals have taken a different form in my mind. The new formlibtech_534_footnotewas first put to use on the occasion of the marriage of Tendulkar and Indu. It is a long time since then, but I have seen no defect in the practice. On the day itself the new form seemed very impressive indeed. Vanulibtech_535_footnoteis getting
 along very well. If the cliniclibtech_536_footnotecontinues in existence, she will complete one full year here. She will lose nothing. On the contrary, I believe she will gain something. I do feel sorry that I am not able to give her as much attention as I should like to but my preoccupations have become so serious even here and I have to husband my time so
 
 carefully that I have no leisure left for anything else.

 It is some days since Pyarelal’s fever subsided. The weakness too, is gradually going. My heart is there all the time and urges me to hurry back. But my sense of dharma keeps me here. I will know more after Sardar’s return.

 BHAI RAMCHANDRA,
 I have your letter. Only those who knew the two men should engage in any agitation on their behalf. Then alone will it be seemly. Maulana Saheb and the Congress are doing their utmost  for  the  release of all detenus. You should be satisfied with that.
 If you send a brief but full statement of the facts about the two, I will not hesitate to do what I can. That either you yourself or someone who knows them should send the facts to the Press is certainly one way.

  	I have your letter. I must admit that I am disappointed in you. 	Prabhudas praised you sky-high. I literally believed him and 	strongly recommended to the secretary of the Ashram that you be 	admitted, but you did not prove worthy of that praise. You caused 	anxiety. It will be good if you have settled down even now. 	Prabhudas’s mother is almost an invalid, though she has her wits 	about her. His father is bed-ridden. If you had remained there as 	his daughter how much less I should have had to worry? As long as 	you do not cultivate true devotion to service, as long as you have 	not controlled your palate and have not learnt to treat all children 	as your own, I do not see how you can do justice to the 	kindergarten. It is more difficult to run a kindergarten than to run 	a school for grown-up children. Very few realize this. Kindergartens 	are the vogue these days. ‘What is there in teaching the 	children?’ There are many who nurture such ignorance. I hope you 	are not a victim of it. This letter is not to dissuade you from 	gaining some kindergarten experience but I feel it would be 	desirable if you served Kashibehn to supplement your experience. 
 Show this letter to Shantabehn. Do what you think right.
 Think of the number of mistakes you have made in writing down a small sloka. Your Devanagari writing is not at all well formed. What did you expect to gain by citing a sloka like that? How nice it would have been if you had given the Gujarati meaning of the sloka provided you had understood it. Your Gujarati handwriting also  invites comment. Even your own signature is not well formed. And you drag it right to the edge of the paper. The letters are so badly formed that I am returning the letter for you to see.

 Mahuva is said to be a health resort. The harbour therefore should suit you.
 I have an impression that there are facilities for education in Mahuva. At one time Dudhabhai was running a school for Harijans there and the attendance too was pretty good. Find out and tell me whether it still continues.
 You have gone to a place where there is much scope for service. The people there are bigoted. Hence very few wear khadi. You may find an odd person here and there wearing it. It is as good as a virgin field. Besides, being an important part of the State, we can see its influence.
 Do as much as you can and keep writing to me. I have an impression that Raichandbhai’s son also stays there. It is not that he has followed Raichandbhai’s profession. He used to write to me and
 
 his ideas are good. Do not go looking for him. It may be you will hear about him.

 "
535,"November 3, 1945",THE CHARKHA SANGH AND POLITICS,"
    
 
 A khadi worker has sent the above letterlibtech_549_footnotelibtech_550_footnoteto Jajuji, Secretary of the Charkha Sangh. He has forwarded it to me to discuss it in Khadi Jagat and to give my opinion on it. The Charkha Sangh is not a small organization. Even today the workers or the servants—whatever you call them—of the Sangh are to be found all over India. Their number is about 3,000. I consider this a small number. Their number should increase considerably when khadi spreads in the country. Even if we have one worker for every village, the number of workers on the rolls of the Charkha Sangh should be 700,000. This requires a lot  of money. But from this one should not conclude that it is impossible to have so many workers. I have never believed that. When the cause is good and there is a spirit of service among the workers the money is always found. I have founded and conducted insitutions all my life. In my experience there has not been a single institution which was closed down or which could not make progress for want of money. On the contrary I have found that some institutions ceased functioning or could not make progress for want of workers. You should not ask how, if not on the strength of money, big factories function and recruitment to the Government offices is made. Those who do not understand fully what I have said above, raise such doubts. I never said that money could serve no purpose. If money served no purpose how could we have become its slaves? I would go to the extent of saying that without money we cannot go ahead. But what I want to say is that if we want to become slaves of money we should give up the
 
 idea of serving the people. And it is the lot of slaves to be suppressed. If however we consider money as our slave and use it as a means and that too for rendering service, then we are making good use of it. For the work of service, our first and indispensable need is workers and when we have such workers money will come chasing them. They will not have to go in search of money. That is why I say if we get seven lakh or even more workers we may take it as though we had the money in the safe. It may be said that we do not pay enough to tempt or attract workers. I admit it. But it is only the spirit that matters. Those who join such philanthropic institutions as the Charkha Sangh do so for the sake of service and not for salaries. They do take  monthly salaries because like the rich the poor too have to feed themselves, but they do so only to keep themselves alive and fit for service. Such workers do not eat or drink or dress merely for pleasure.
 If we assume that such are the workers of the Charkha Sangh then they do not have any time to take part in politics. The Charkha Sangh cannot function at all if the workers devote eight hours to office work and spend the rest of thetime in pleasure or otherwise. Because they are the people who will make or mar the Sangh. Therefore they should devote their spare time to making themselves more competent for improving its activities, such as learning all the processes of khadi-making, studying its science, and doing well all that they do.
 This does not mean that the workers of the Charkha Sangh have no interest in politics or other activities. They are and should be interested in such activities. However, they should keep that interest in check and give expression to it through their work in the Charkha Sangh. Then only can they understand true politics. A Charkha Sangh worker will remain a true voter and will vote for the candidate put up by the Congress but he will not bother to canvass for him. He will not deliver speeches supporting him. He will not devote his time to such work. Congress work is peoples’ work. The Congress belongs to the people. The Charkha Sangh has been created by the Congress and the Charkha Sangh also belongs to the people. Just as political work is Congress work the Sangh work is also Congress work. How can a man ride two horses at the same time? One who joins the Charkha Sangh should devote himself wholly to its activities and one who  joins politics should devote his entire time to politics. In this way both supplement each other’s work. What I said above is at the back of the
 rule that the workers of Charkha Sangh should not take active part in politics.

  	It is not right that you have not written to me at all recently. I 	was to reply to your other questions only after I had received your 	reply to my suggestion, and that is still so.  	Kanchan is on fire. Who else but you can quench that fire? Even if 	you released her, she would not marry anybody else. And she is not 	one to satisfy her passion through illicit relations with somebody. 	And yet passion is burning her up. She does not know the value of 	brahmacharya. She has married to gratify her passion. You did 	not tell her about the condition of brahmacharya when 	marrying her. Is it not your dharma, now, to satisfy her? If you 	were completely free from passion, I would have had nothing to tell 	you. After giving Kanchan the gift of children you may observe 	brahmacharya, or you should calm her not with anger but with 	pure love. You should look after Kishorelal, Gomati, Chhaganlal and 	Borde, and so also should Kanchan. Write to me.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 8428. Also C.W. 5601.

  	I have your letter. I feel sorry for you, and equally sorry for 	Munnalal. I have written to him and told him in so many words that 	he should set up house with you and that, if the two of you cannot 
 voluntarily observe self-control, you may have children. However, if he cannot bring himself to agree to this I cannot force him against his will. You should, therefore, remain calm. Show this to Munnalal. If he refuses to change his mind you should leave the matter to God and engross yourself in work. For the present I should like you, if your health permits, to look after Gomatibehn, as also the others who are ill. We shall discuss the question of your accompanying me when I come. You had wanted to accompany me to Madras. Now you suggest both Madras and Bengal. That will have to be thought over. We shall do so when I arrive there. Meanwhile you should remain calm, get well and serve as much as you can. You are a fine worker. Let service be your husband, your hobby, your all. But if that cannot be, it does not matter. In any case do not think one thing and speak another.

          POONA, 
    CHI. 	SUSHILA,  November 	4, 1945 
  	I wonder whether you know it, but Kishorelal and Gomati- behn are 	getting weaker and weaker. The cold of Sevagram does not suit them. 	They shrink from asking for anybody’s services. Gomatibehn is 	actually ill. She is suffering from some kind of typhoid. The 	constant fever has now come down a little. We trust and hope that it 	will come down to normal. But it will take some time for her to 	leave the sick-bed, and it will be quite a while before she is able 	to look after herself. She would not accept the services of anyone 	who may offer them, and if they can help it, neither of them would 	accept anybody’s services. I would like it if someone were to stay 	with them now and look after them. There is no question as to 	whether they will like it, for  I have not heard of their having 	ever complained to anyone about not getting any service. But 	wouldn’t my heart complain? If, therefore, you can get away from 	there and go to Sevagram, and if your health permits you to look 	after them, I think it would be the best    
 arrangement. In that case you will also have to cancel your plan of accompanying me to Calcutta. I believe it will be February by the time I finish touring and return to the Ashram. By that time, winter will be over and we may hope that both of them will have got well. I hope to reach Sevagram on the 21st. I should like both of you to go to Sevagram before then. I think it necessary for Manilal to accompany me on my tour, not to look after me but to gain experience which might help him in his work and to get to know people. He, therefore, will not be there all the time. Arun will certainly accompany me to Sevagram. One cannot say what progress he will make in studies, but I think he is showing himself to be a good servant. He has taken to Kanu and, therefore, he is bound to learn to serve. Hence he also will help. Besides, if both of you agree of your own accord, not for my sake, to let Arun stay and grow up in the Ashram, as he now says he would like to do, he will study and also acquire practical wisdom. Moreover, he has now become friends with Aminbhai, who is  a  learned man, and stays in the Ashram. Probably you do not know him. Manilal is certain to know him. He is an artist like you, but a much better one. Arun has already started learning from him. And Aminbhai says that if he were given two years’ time Arun would learn much more here than he would by joining even the best of schools. This may perhaps be too optimistic a view. But what difference does it make to us? It is a fact that his company is bene- ficial. My purpose in writing all this about Arun is to tell you that he has the spirit of service in him and that, since he will be with you in the Ashram, you will not get bored there. Kishorelal and Gomati-behn will thus have the benefit of your service without any hardship to you. If they feel that you are likely to suffer in any way by staying there to look after them, they are not the type who will put up with it. Let me add too that Kashi also is tired out. She cannot work much now. And Chhaganlal is  on sickbed. He has continuous fever. If it turns out to be as prolonged as Gomatibehn’s, he also will require to be looked after. I believe, therefore, that it will be good if you are in the Ashram for his sake at any rate. I have thus put before you what I believe to be your duty. Both of you may think over this and do what you consider right. If your presence there is not essential, both of you should at once leave for the Ashram. You may write to me from there and tell me what you intend to do. Ilalibtech_554_footnotelibtech_555_footnotewill be with you, of course. But my impression about
 
 
 her is that she is not likely to be burden on anybody. And, moreover, she cannot stay without you.

I see from it that you have not 	received my previous letter. There is nothing wrong with my health. 	I am quite well.  	I shall leave here for Bombay on the 19th, reaching Sevagram on the 	21st. I shall leave for Calcutta on December 30 and be there for a 	month and three weeks. Then maybe 15 days in Madras. Then 
 again back to Sevagram for 5 or 7 days and thence perhaps to the Frontier Province. Only on returning from there can I settle down in Sevagram. This means that right now my stay in Sevagram cannot be permanent. If therefore you want to spend a little time in the Ashram you can do so only in my absence. But do as you feel inclined.

     CHI. 	DINSHAW,  November 	6, 1945 
  	I could not write to you yesterday but I kept mulling  over things. 	You can have anything you like under the Trust, but I would    
 say that we cannot start anything at Singhgadh right now. It is another matter if I think of something to start there. The Bombay centre will have to be closed down. I would advise you to keep it for your own diversion and as a source of income. I cannot afford to have it under the Trust. I have still not received the figures about your personal expenses. If you are provided board and lodging and Rs. 500/- per month from here, in my view, you should not think of making extra money from nature cure. But here you must ask your  own conscience. If this is a bitter pill, then you must live in Bombay and carry on your practice. If you put it in the Trust, it may be closed down soon after. You do not have to worry at all about the expense here. I shall manage. I am anticipating that there will not be a single rich patient left here by the end of December. The facilities here will solely be for those whom I send.
 The person I send to manage things here will stay here. Meat will be cooked in the kitchen for only Maji and any members of your family who may be visiting but not for any patient. My dharma tells me that non-vegetarian food, such as mutton, liver, etc., have no place in nature cure. I do not suggest that those things have not benefited or cannot benefit anyone. All I say is that in my view they cannot be included in nature cure. The entire portion I am occupying at present will be reserved for you and Gulbai and it should not be necessary at any time to vacate it even for me. Whenever I come, I can live anywhere on the upper floor. It will not be difficult for me even to stay in the room which Saralabehn is at present occupying. If it rains I can settle in the bathroom. But it is not the least bit fair for me to occupy the portion especially built for Gulbai.
 A ‘stock list’ should be prepared for the Trust.  Perhaps  it cannot be done till Bhimnag comes, though of course I have with me so many people here that I can easily get the stock list and such other things prepared. But your method of getting work done is altogether different. I do not like it. That way there are many things that I do not like, but I put up with them. If you take up the responsibility, most of the things here can be settled while I am here. I consider it wrong that you do not get patients to work. Vanamala is capable of doing a lot of work. All the patients would not be bed-ridden. From now on, only the poor must be admitted. If there is any rich patient, he will be brought only by me and he will serve some purpose. I may even take money from him and he will stay at my pleasure. It irks me that you have not trained even Gulbai properly. No one here seems to be
 
 getting any training. I do not even see the three-year training being given here which you thought was necessary. That is not correct. But in this matter, I have got to be content with whatever you can easily provide. If you think that thereby the whole thing would completely change and if it is not proper for me to interfere to such an extent, you can remove me. If I were to involve myself in the matter, I would let things continue as they are. I receive letters from people from all over. They are willing to help in this or even join in. Some of them I must admit are very good. But till such time as I see you as a votary of nature cure and know who will be the right people to work with you, I would not like to admit any nature cure expert. If I run this workshop  I would like to pass on its benefits to the thousands of people outside. For that, I would naturally need to have a large number of workers. Only when that happens, can we at last have something like a university.
 Give some thought to this. I have not kept a copy of this letter. Return it to me after reading. I shall have it copied and then give it back to you. I have written down my thoughts as they came while I was still in bed in the morning.

Red tape has and 	does not have a place among family members. It means that none  of  	them  are bound to one another and that everything is going on 	smoothly       
 without friction. Writing down everything begins as soon as friction begins.

The truth that we see is relative, many-sided, plural and is the whole truth for a given time. There is no scope for vanity in it and the only way of reaching it is through ahimsa.

  	Your handwriting is particularly bad. It is not worthy of you. In my 	view each character of the alphabet is a drawing, and no drawing is 	made by scrawling. Whether it is of a mere learner or that of a 	great painter the broad outline must look the same to the eye. The 	drawings of a parrot made by a learner and an expert artist will 	look alike in their general form, but the quality of art in each 	will reveal who is the learner and who the expert. Similarly, the 	shape of “ ” drawn by a 
 learner and that of one drawn by an expert artist must appear alike. The difference would be seen only in the quality of art in each. But in the drawings of your letters there is no resemblance at all. I would blame your teacher more than you for this. If you have understood what I have said above and still continue to draw shapeless lines  instead of fine letters, I will blame you. Your body must have now become as strong as an athlete’s.

  	Chi. Kanu has given me a complete summary of your letter. I see your 	generosity and Ba’s holy merit in the great care you are    
 taking of Uncle and in the fact that you are treating him as a respected elder. If Uncle recovers fully, all the credit will go to you, though personally I would give part of it to Bhai Krishnavarma. He has, so far, not asked me even for the expense he has incurred on Uncle and has nursed him as well as he could for the sake of Ba. Had he not come forward to help, I would have been at a loss to know where to put Uncle.
 Your idea of helping Uncle run a small store in your neigh- bourhood is no doubt good, but please do not put it into effect immediately. After his establishment has been wound up, as you have suggested, and he has completely forgotten about it and become perfectly composed, I see no harm in your letting him start a store in partnership with any member of your family. Let not greed make him or anyone of you go in for speculation."

     CHI. 	MANILAL,  November 	8, 1945 
  	I got your letter and postcard. Arun has taken away your letter and 	has not returned it. He is always in high spirits these days. He 	soon makes friends with everybody who comes here. So I do not now 	worry about him. Though he makes no effort, he does learn a little. 	There is, therefore, no need for any of you to worry about him just 	now.  	Please go to Bombay for the books. Maybe you have already gone 	there. If you wish, you may certainly pay a flying visit here before 	returning. But do not come here for my sake at all, for all my needs 	are being properly looked after. So far as I can judge, you need not 	come even for the sake of Arun. If, therefore, you come it must be 	only for the pleasure of the trip. We will leave for Bombay on the 	morning of the 19th. I should advise you to wait for me in Bombay 	or, as I have already written, at Sevagram. It is the duty of you 	two to serve Kishorelalbhai, Gomatibehn, Chhaganlalbhai and 	Kashibehn as much as you can. 
 Tell Ila I have no reason to remember her. She does not keep a single promise. She had said she would not leave me, but she went away. And she does not make haste to learn to write so that she can at least write to me. I hope she will now lose no time to learn to write letters to me in a beautiful hand.
 I think that it would now be better to send   Uncle’s  keyslibtech_586_footnotelibtech_587_footnoteto Kunvarji Mehta, at Adarsh Dugdhalaya, Malad. He has  asked  for them. He has written a long letter. He wishes to sell off his things. He seems to be well composed in mind at present.
 I forgot to ask you to send Uncle’s keys to Kunvarjibhai. Kanu says I have already written about it above. I have not read it over.

 I have your postcard. You have not yet improved your handwriting as much as one would wish. It is very good that you spent a part of your holidays with Vinobaji. And you took Sanskrit instruction from him which no doubt was also religious.
 I hope Ushalibtech_589_footnoteis all right. Why do you use Arabic numerals while writing in Devanagari?
 CHI. NIMU,
 Today I have Sumi’slibtech_590_footnoteletter. She writes to say that a sum of Rs. 125 was stolen from her. This is a case of feeble cattle having too many ticks.

 Tell Bapu that I have always held the view, which has become all the clearer to me while translating some books, that if we wish to make Hindustani the language of the common people, its vocabulary should mostly consist, except for words which have religious associations, of Arabic and Persian words or their derivatives instead of Sanskrit. The seven or eight hundred years of Hindu-Muslim contact has made Urdu a more common language than Hindi. This must be the view of everyone who is not biased and  is  honest  and straightforward. The good of the country lies in our acknowledging this truth.

A true widow does not 	believe that because the body of her husband has perished, the soul 	has also perished. A woman is married not to a human frame but to 	the soul which resides in it.

Your duty is to serve, giving the first place to spinning. Learn the 	processes preceding and following spinning.

  	I have your letter. The correspondence has been published.libtech_601_footnotelibtech_602_footnoteIt 	is rather interesting how this came about. On the one hand Bapa 	writes to say that I was hasty in getting it published because I had 	agreed that we should publish it only after the meeting of the 	Managing Committee. How nice it would have been if he had had me put 	it down in writing. I myself have no such recollection. Kanu says 	that he was present at the time and that I had told Bapa that if 	something had happened and if the matter was to be published, the 	sooner this was done the better. Well, that is as it may be. Your 	own recollection is that   I was to give a short statement of my own 	in the end. I remember having said something like that but I had not 	decided on it. Having considered the whole thing I felt that since 	my letterlibtech_603_footnotelibtech_604_footnotelibtech_605_footnoteto you gave the entire 	background it was better published. Now if this step was mistaken 	how can it be rectified? I don’t see anything wrong in publishing 	the facts. I have not seen what has come out in the newspapers. If 	you are talking about the English translation, I had certainly 	approved it but I do not know if the same has appeared in the 	newspapers.

 a talk with you and then write to me. Sushila Pai is a very good worker. She is a learned woman. She was for many years the Head Mistress of Vanita Vishram, Rajkot. She gave up the job on her own. She is a woman of great promise. It is possible that she will not like to join as a clerk. In whatever capacity she comes, it will be only provisionally. I have not written to her again as I am waiting for Sucheta’s letter. Please see how the work is to be divided. Spend on the building only as much as is necessary for providing the conveniences. I take it that you will not have to get permission for this from the Managing Committee. I am not going through the rules and regulations. I have passed on that responsibility to Shamlal. In fact we should know it by heart. There was a time when I could do that but of late I have forgotten all about it. I have had to.
 I got your letter of today after writing this. Sushila will answer it.

621,"November 13, 1945","FOREWORD TO “CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMME—ITS MEANING AND
			PLACE”","
         	This is a thoroughly revised edition of the Constructive 	Programme which I first wrote in 1941.libtech_635_footnoteThe items included in it have not been arranged in 	any order, certainly not in the order of their importance. When the 	reader discovers that a particular subject though important in 	itself in terms of independence does not find place in the 	programme, he should know that the omission is not intentional. He 	should unhesitatingly add to my list and let me know. My list does 	not pretend to be exhaustive; it is merely illustrative. The reader 	will see several new and important additions.    
 Readers, whether workers and volunteers or not, should  definitely realize that the constructive programme is the truthful and non-volent way of winning poorna swaraj. Its wholesale fulfilment is complete independence. Imagine all the forty crores of  people busying themselves with the whole of the constructive programme which is designed to build up the nation from the very  bottom  upward. Can anybody dispute the proposition that it must mean complete independence in every sense of the expression, including the ousting of foreign domination? When the critics laugh at the proposition, what they mean is that forty crores of people will never co-operate in the effort to fulfil the programme. No doubt, there is considerable truth in the scoff. My answer is, it is still worth the attempt. Given an indomitable will on the part of a band of earnest workers, the programme is as workable as any other and more so than most. Anyway, I have no substitute for it, if it is to be based on non- violence.
 Civil disobedience, mass or individual, is an aid to constructive effort and is a full substitute for armed revolt. Training is necessary as well for civil disobedience as for armed revolt. Only the ways are different. Action in either case takes place only when occasion demands. Training for military revolt means learning the use of arms ending perhaps in the atomic bomb. For civil disobedience it means the constructive programme.
 Therefore, workers will never be on the look-out for civil resistance. They will hold themselves in readiness, if the constructive effort is sought to be defeated. From one or two illustrations it will be seen where it can be and where it cannot be offered. Political pacts we know have been and can be, but personal friendship with individuals cannot be, prevented. Such friendships, selfless and genuine, must be the basis for political pacts. Similarly, centralized khadi  can  be defeated by the Government, but no power can defeat individual manufacture and use of khadi. The manufacture and use of khadi must not be imposed upon the people, but it must be intelligently and willingly accepted by them as one of the items of the freedom movement. This can be done only from the villages as units. Pioneers even in such programmes can be obstructed. They have had to go through the fire of suffering throughout the world. There is no swaraj without suffering. In violence, truth is the first and greatest sufferer; in non-violence it is ever triumphant. Moreover, men composing the Government are not to be regarded as enemies. To regard them as such will be contrary to the non-violent spirit. Part we must, but as friends.
 If this preliminary observation has gone home to the reader, he will find the constructive programme to be full of deep interest. It
 should prove as absorbing as politics so called and platform oratory, and certainly more important and useful.

 November 13, 1945
 DEAR SIR EVAN,
 I have just seen Reuter’s message from London about the threatened arrest of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.libtech_636_footnote
 I admit that Pandit Nehru’s speeches are hot, if the British rulers do not want to part with power and hand over to the people what is theirs. They are not, if the British professions are real. It will be wrong to attribute hatred or malice to him. He undoubtedly speaks strongly against the I. C. S. men. But there he speaks the people’s mind. And he is right. The fine doctrine propounded by His Excellency of “Forget and Forgive” can only apply to the excesses of a soldiery in action but surely not to inexusable butchery, inhumanity, bribery, corruption and the like. If his statements are wrong, they should be tested through an open and impartial tribunal. If the Government’s hands are clean they have nothing to fear from publicity.
 I will not waste His Excellency’s time by arguing about the obvious.libtech_637_footnote

        CHI. 	JIVANJI, I 	have your letter.  POONA,  November 	13, 1945 
  	I have been working since the last eight days on the booklet 	regarding constructive work. That is to say, I have been giving it 	every minute that I can spare from time to time. I finished it two 	days ago, but I made so many revisions that I intend to get some 	portions rewritten. So that has taken another two days and is likely 	to take two more days still. To that extent the pamphlet will become 	new and perfect. I could have polished it still further. But is not 	greed a hill that lives and grows? It is not inert. Do not believe 	all  that  has appeared in the newspapers regarding Sardar’s 	biography. I have not seen the report. When I heard about the plan 	for presenting a book of tributes to Sardar, as promised, I put an 	end to it and suggested that an authentic biography be written 	instead. There would be no question of presenting it to him. I 	therefore refused to give a message when they approached me and thus 	stopped the plan for tributes. It was Munshilibtech_639_footnote     
 who took the lead and I, therefore, suggested that if he took up the work he would be able to do full justice to it. I have not inquired what happened or is happening after that. I do not know whether you are writing the biography or getting it written. You may ask Munshiji direct. The work is entrusted to Patil and Tendulkar. The letter is to work as Munshi’s assistant. If, therefore, Munshi has agreed, you should put together all the material you get and send it to Munshiji. If he is not going to do the work, ask me again. I had also suggested that the date for publication of the book should be announced right now and we should adhere to it.
 You may take it that as regards the journalslibtech_640_footnoteI  am  ready.  I  do not now, though, how far I shall be able to cope with the work. But I think I must do it if the publication can be resumed without difficulty. You need not flatter anybody. Mavalankar or you may meet the Magistrate officially and ask him. If he agrees, take out a licence. We should give no binding, orally or in writing. Only if the Government also wants the publication of the journals to be resumed may we bring them out. It would be intolerable if they were to demand a security as soon as an article appeared. If they are interested in the publications being resumed, they will have to give us the required paper. After all, how much would we need? There is no question of advertisements. We shall have to print a large number of copies. We must print at many as there is a demand for. I expect that we shall have to print at least as many as we used to do. Give me full detials. And give me reasonable time for the first issue. You may, thus, assume that I shall be ready even if I am touring at the time.

  	I was very happy with our talks yesterday. We would not have 	discussed more yesterday and it is my view that we shall not be able 	to finish our work at a single sitting. We must meet from time to 	time. I am so made that if I had the strength to travel about, I 	would seek you out, stay with you for a day or two, have some talk 	and then leave. Though I am not in a position to do that now, you 	may know I have done such things before. I want that people should 	know us as we know each other. If in the end we find that our paths 	are diferent, then so be it. Our hearts will still remain one, for 	they are one. The talks we had yesterday have given me the 	impression that there is not much difference in our outlook or the 	way we understand things. I went to    
 tell you how I have understood you. If there is any difference you will let me know.
  The 	crucial question 	according to you, is how 	to ensure man’s 	mental, economic, political and 	moral development. That 	is my 	position too.  And 	in doing 	so every 	inividual should have 	equal right and 	opportunity.  From 	this point of 	view there 	should be equality 	between villages 	and cities. 	And therefore 	their food and 	drink, their way 	of life, 	their dress 	and their 	habits should 	be the same. If  such 	 a condition 	is to be brought 	about people 	should produce their own 	cloth and 	food and 	build their on 	houses. So 	 also  they  should 	produce their own 	water and electricity.  Man 	is not 	born to live 	in the 	jungle; he 	is born to 	live in 	society. If 	we are to 	make sure that one 	person does 	not ride on an 	other’s back, the 	unit should 	be an ideal 	village or 	a social 	group which will be 	self-sufficient, but the 	members of which 	will be interdependent. 	This conception 	will bring about a 	change in 	human relationship 	all over the world. 
 If I have undertood you correctly up to here, I shall take up the second part. I have had Rajkumari translate the letter which I wrote to you earlier. I am getting this also translated and will send the translation along with this.libtech_642_footnotelibtech_643_footnoteI serve two purposes be getting the letters translated.

 You 	have frankly expressed your views. I like that. I told you I      
 would answer your two questions. First, I am not impressed by the American system. I have regard for their enthusiasm and courage but at present we cannot proceed on those lines, nor do I wish to do so. That is why I do not like your new village scheme. My advice is that if you have the time, go and see our villages and do what you can. Go and see what my associates, the Kumarappa brothers and the other three are doing.
 I have always liked to keep good relations with America but I have never liked having an agency there, nor do I like it now. This is more or less a matter of self-satisfaction if not self-deception. If we build up strength in India itself, it is bound to have its impact. The British Government spends lakhs of rupees on spreading falsehood. Must we imitate their ways to spread truth? I know the clergy in America do such things. I also know that there is, as there should be, a lot of difference between propagating truth and propagating untruth. What more shall I say?

 Naturopathy or any other work is never stalled  for  lack  of funds. But it certainly is stalled if it lacks purity and sincere workers. The figures you have quoted must remain on paper only. If the thing had been all that easy in practice, we would have progressed a great deal by now. We have to sweat to increase 4 to 20; increasing 20 to 100 or 100 to 500 is just a dream.

POONA,
 November 14, 1945
 
CHI. DINSHAW,
 My cogitations go on. The institution should close down on December 31. From January 1, it should become an institution for the poor and cease to be one for the rich. You have so far insisted that the poor should be taken only after the rich have been accommodated but those who are really poor can hardly reach you and if anyone reaches you, they will have to pay the rates the rich pay, which will completely ruin them. From the 1st January let the rich come after the poor are accommodated but only if they can live as the poor. The institution should have more cleanliness than it has today. Money is  not  necessary for maintaining cleanliness, but it requires care, love, truth and knowledge. So it is better that cleaning work is started from today, but I am afraid it is not possible because no one listens to the others and everyone is his own master. If anyone takes interest in work, it is only to please you. Therefore there can be improvement only if someone from among the people I mentioned above starts working from today. If this thing does not appeal to you, both of us will have to repent ultimately because I believe that cleanliness is a part of God. I would amend the saying “cleanliness is next to godliness” and say “cleanliness is godliness”. But only if cleanliness is both internal and external can we call it an attribute of God.
 A sign-board should be hung here from January 1. It should be written in Marathi, Devanagari, Urdu and English. I have not in my mind formed a precise idea but it would be somewhat as follows. “The poor  are given nature-cure treatment here”.The name Healthotorium should be removed. There is no need for any name. It does not befit a poor institution. In fact it does not befit any. The English would consider it “vulgar”.
 We should not use foreign things whether they are patent or not. The poor cannot afford a bottle of Isapgol pakced in England, Robinson Barley, Quaker Oats, Sanatogen, Horlicks, malted milk or Merck’s Glucose. We, from here, cannot teach the people to take these things—it is immaterial who is here—whether Sardar, some Raja or I.
 We must make Sanatogen here. Things similar to Horlicks and malted milk should be made here and also something like glucose should be available.
 The kitchen can no longer function on the lines it has been doing so far. Today you have the means to feed even a king. But those means must be given up tomorrow. The liberality with which fruit and other things are used here hurts me much. It ought to be changed. Can’t we manage with jaggery and lemon?
 You must develop the habit of writing. Let your Gujarati be faulty, it can be expressed in good language. Little booklets should be brought out from here. You will have to pay a lot of attention to all these things. I do not know how you will be able to do that while earning 4-5 thousand rupees a month. But bear in mind that if you cannot do it the University will remain merely a dream. I have a capacity for boundless work and also for planning. But I do not have a magic wand by waving which I can create a university. Further, I do not have the knowledge reuqired for that. Therefore I am helpless. If I was not helpless I would have started a nature cure clinic of my own, and would have carried on all my activities from there. But God did not grant me that. Although I was, and still am, very enthusiastic, which is why I am clinging on to you, you are a big man and you have allowed your knowledge to stagnate. That is a big stumbling- block in your way. Your dream will be realized only if you can get over it. If your heart bids you that it is not possible, then leave me even now. I shall not feel bad. Sardar is worried how I am going to cope with the work. His worry is meaningless because no one compels me. God impels me to do the work. If He wants to stop the work He will do so. But you seem to have faith in me, so I must warn you about my helplessness. And I must let you know the limitations and faults I find in you. More when something strikes me.

Before 1942 Bhulabhai was assigned the task of the Trust Deed but some obstacles kept delaying it. Then war broke out and the work of the Trust Deed was left in the air. I shall be glad if you discuss this with Bhulabhai and complete the work of the Trust Deed.libtech_645_footnote
 Mukerji, who has been the secretary of the Jallianwala Bagh committee for years, will see you. It will be some time before he reaches there.
I am happy that you have once again taken up public work.

 to do and continue the work? All this seems difficult. Write everything in brief.

         November 	15, 1945  BHAI 	MANGALDAS,  	I have your letter. I see you are working at great speed. I on my 	part am doing what I can from here.  	I have gone through Motilal’s and your opinion. I agree with it. 	But there is one thing neither of you appear to have considered. The 	words are: “one should not refuse to sell [khadi] which is worth 	buying”. Now the question is which khadi should be considered 	“worth buying”. One might say that the khadi which had been 	produced according to the conditions laid down by me was “worth 	buying”. Isn’t that so? Why can’t I say that I will sell my 	khadi only to the person who pays me the highest price for it? This 	gives rise to many more questions but I do not wish to discuss them. 	They are irrelevant at the moment. But I have been forced to write 	this becuase it is not irrelevant to point out the snag which I 	notice and which prevents me from publishing your views. So if it 	can be put right, I would of course like to get it done, so that it 	can be published. But if there is something wrong in my way of 	thinking, I should not proceed with it for the moment. 
 I hope to reach there by the morning train on the 19th. Sardar and others will be with me. I shall leave for Wardha on the 20th evening.
 Now about Munshi. I did not like the articlelibtech_647_footnotelibtech_648_footnoteyou showed me which appeared in the Chronicle. I found malice in it. Munshi had come here on business of his own. I asked him about it. He showed me the mistakes in the article and there were other defects also. Even if Jawaharlal had sent a messagelibtech_649_footnotelibtech_650_footnote, Munshi did not get it. Afterwards Jawaharlal also came and when I asked him he said that he did not have the slightest recollection of having sent a message. He might have told somebody to send one but it was of no value. The gist of this is that there is very little truth in newspapers and they are full of falsehood. If a man acts believing in their veracity he must lose. I certainly do not wish to see you lose.

  	I have carefully gone through your letter. I like it because you 	have taken pains to clear your mind. I have come to the conclusion 	that under the circumstances you should not start work in my 	absence.

BHAI DASTANE,
 What can poor Akkalibtech_653_footnotelibtech_654_footnoteor Vatsalalibtech_655_footnotelibtech_656_footnotelibtech_657_footnotetell you? All your daughters are good and wish to give you the minimum trouble. At the same time they want to take the minimum obligation from others. But I know the way they depend on you unknowingly. Of course I don’t blame anyone. Our circumstances often are such that we cannot get out of them. That is why I advise you that you should take up grihasthashramalibtech_658_footnoteand   the   more   you   purify   it   and   remain   pure yourself the better will you serve the country. Today we are all intoxicated. Intoxication is not always due to liquor, ganja or  opium. I have seen that being intoxicated with vanity or the craze for swaraj is at times worse than the intoxication of liquor. To know our swadharma and to be engrossed in it is our supreme dharma. That is why, let me add, I can only discuss things with you but I cannot think as you do. Do take as much as you can digest from what I say and go ahead.
 I would suggest you have a talk with the members of the Working Committee. I cannot go very far. My position is like that of a ‘tenant at will’libtech_659_footnotelibtech_660_footnote. The difference is great. I am what I am without any conscious effort on my part, and the poor tenant at will desires to stay for ever. I came across a sloka by Bhartrihari, “In fact one who is attached to sense-objects and one who is free from them are both in the same position. The latter voluntarily gives up sense-objects and enjoys bliss, while the self-indulgent one too has to give up his sensual pleasures every now and then and earns only misery.” Bhartrihari has crammed a great deal of wisdom into this. Let us all drink that nectar and attain bliss.
I have communicated to Kripalaniji some of my ideas about the
 
 elections. I am discussing things with Shankarraoji. Now it is time for me to go for my walk. I shall take a stroll with him and shall tell him what I think about the elections.

 I have your letter. You have well described your difficulties. You are gaining plenty of experience also. Learn to cultivate sweetness even from it. Many people get embittered by bitter
 
 
 experiences and feel frustrated because of repeated disappointments. If you do so, then your study of the Gita will have been in vain. We have to make our path through the Brahmin-non-Brahmin, Hindu- Muslim, and inter-provincial differences and march ahead with our work.

          CHI. 	LILAVATI,       November 	16, 1945 
  	I have your postcard. You must give up the craving for letters in my 	handwriting. I am dictating this lying down in the evening after the 	prayers. Sometimes two line suffice, but at times I have to write at 	length. You had better leave it to me when I should write myself or 	when and to whom I should dictate.  	Now that you have started the exerciselibtech_668_footnotedo not give it up. You can go up to 108 namaskars. 	Many asanas can be performed while doing suryanamaskar. 	It is largely for you to see which ones will suit you best. Consider 	also whether you should go up to 108 namaskars. There is no 	point in losing weight by starving. One has to reduce weight if one 	has put on any because of some disease, but that too not by starving 	oneself. If even with regular exercise and balanced diet       
 you put on weight, let it be so. You need not worry about it in the least.
 You have used the word ‘stunt’ in a wrong context. You can translate it as dhating in Gujarati. The changes in diet or other methods adopted for reducing weight cannot be called stunt. Those who digest what they have studied keep on pursuing the study in order to acquire more knowledge without even thinking about the examination results. While studying they build up their bodies as best they can because keeping the body healthy, strong and lustrous is also a part of learning. I give you full encouragement to study what you have undertaken not for the sake of getting a degree but for the knowledge that you will acquire while studying for it. Since you have already studied Graylibtech_669_footnotelibtech_670_footnoteonce, it should be a mere child’s play to go through it a second time. The oftener you read it, the more knowledge you will gain.
 It will be good if you give up the habit of walking about as you read. It spoils the eyesight and sometimes the thoughts also wander. While walking one can think over and digest what one has read or think of the work one has done during the day, and so on. But the eyes have to look around and take note of the surroundings and watch out for any obstruction in one’s way. One cannot walk with eyes closed but a person like me who walks with the support of others enjoys the pleasure of doing so. But that is not for you.
Stick to your decision not to attend Lakshmidas’s wedding.
 I have signed at two places. That shows how bad my memory is.

BHAI ATULANAND,
 I have your postcard. I have sent the thing on to a historian who has also made a serious study of the Hindu-Muslim question. I am awaiting his reply. A leading Congressman told me that it would not do any good to write anything like this in the name of the Congress because the atmosphere was such that people had shut their ears to objectively expressed views of others and such being  the  case anything said was bound to be misunderstood. Therefore, I am not keen to have this published. Seeing the atmosphere that prevails I myself hold a similar view. But lest I do injustice to your endeavour I have sent it to a historian for his opinion. This much I can say that it will not be possible to have it published as quickly as you want. Let us see what comes of it and what I finally decide.
 My visit to Bengal will not be long in coming now. I hope to reach there on December 1st. Do meet me there. Let me, however, tell you that the final decision lies not with those with an English education but with the millions of people who know their mother tongue or the national language. Therefore, write the original in your mother tongue, Bengali; and for other provinces in the national language in both the scripts. If you agree with what I say, start reading and writing the national language in both the scripts. Would Rabi Babu’s writings and poetry have had any impact on Bengali if he had written in English?
 Yours sincerely,

Yesterday I could not go where I intended to go, 	could not do what I intended to do. I only watched the  tamashalibtech_673_footnotelibtech_674_footnote. Such things give me a fright. I am also past the age 	when they could interest me. I had intended to inspect all the 	living  quarters and latrines in the sanatorium and to offer 	suggestions. I had intended to talk to the doctors and joke with the 	patients. I have to say none of this was done. I had especially 	brought along Nargisbehn. She could not see anything. I would not 	take her to watch a tamasha at any time. Impelled by your 	love I spared three hours out of a busy schedule. These days it is 	not an easy thing for me to spare three hours. They are not mine, 	they belong to the people. And you should not be instrumental in my 	wasting even a minute. Now do this much. I want    
 the estimate of expense incurred on a single hut and also how much out of it was spent on the septic tank. If you can easily procure a plan of the hut and the septic tank, I would like to have it. The septic tank is a good device. There was some rank grass around and it seems valuable water, containing manure, flowing from the tank is going waste. Something had better be done about it.

  	Please read the enclosed letter and return it to me with your 	opinion on what should be done.

I sent you yesterday the pamphlet on constructive programme after 	revising it with great labour. Inadvertently, it was posted as 	unregistered packet. I shall, therefore, feel worried till I get an 	acknowledgment from you. For I have kept no copy of it. But I derive 	what comfort I can from the story of Newton who, after being 	slightly upset when the manuscript on which he had been working for 	many years was destroyed in a fire by somebody, proceeded to write 	it all over again. And with this thought I keep patience. I hope it 	will not be lost on the way. But if it is, I will revise another 	copy. It will mean loss of some time, of course. If, therefore, you 	receive it safely, spend money on a wire, but if you don’t get it 	send another copy with your suggestions so that I may start work on 	it immediately.

POONA,
 November, 18, 1945
 
CHI. GHANSHYAMDAS,
 I have no doubt that you have done everything possible with regard to the land at Nasik. Dinshaw is an eccentric man but he is very good, generous and simple-hearted. In the matter of nature cure he is the only man on whom my eyes are fixed. I shall go on encouraging him in his virtues and, if I can do so, it will be of much help to the patients. Therefore, when I saw that he was himself not keen on going to Nasik, I dropped the matter. With that I also decided to begin the new term of the institution from here and run it for the poor. So far only the rich have come and the poor have remained behind. But now the rich who wish to be admitted here will have to come after the poor. The rich will get the same facilities as the poor. At the same time it is certain that an attempt will be made to observe the rules of cleanliness as meticulously as possible. No doubt it is a difficult task. I should not cultivate such an interest in my declining years. But what lay dormant for years has awakened without any effort on my part. How can I resist it? God’s will alone will prevail. For the time being the insti- tution of which you too are a trustee has been closed. If it is to come into existence out of the activities here, it will. Whatever happens will be proper from all points of view. I shall write to you if I have to go to Nasik or need money to carry on this institution. At present I am just watching. There is some money lying with me. I shall manage with it. Since it is the condition of this trust that the management will not be left in Dinshaw’s hands, you may as well say that the responsibility will mine.
 I have read Shivnath Singh’s letter you sent me. It did not make a favourable impression on me. He has written at great lengthlibtech_679_footnotelibtech_680_footnote. I am writing a brief note to him.

668,,668. DISCUSSION WITH HINDUSTANI PRACHAR SABHA WORKERS,"
 
 BOMBAY,
 [Novemeber 19, 1945]libtech_685_footnote
 To a questions why the Urdu script should be imposed on a person who did not like it and wished to learn the national language only through the Devanagari script, Mahatma Gandhi replied:
It is not a question of liking or disliking. If you do not like the
 Urdu script, then I conclude that you do not like Hindustani. The Urdu script must be learnt. Without effort and sacrifice we cannot dream of winning freedom. So far as the provinces  of Bombay, Gujarat and Maharashtra are concerned, the question of learning the Nagari script does not arise at all as everybody knows it already. Then, where does Hindustani Prachar come in? In learning the other script, do not think you are conferring a favour on anyone. It should be considered as your duty. It is a national work and everyone should do it. By learning both the scripts you can better understand both the Hindi and the Urdu developments of the language. I can understand Sanskritized Hindi, but what about the masses? It is our duty to learn both the scripts. Then alone can we hoenstly serve the country in a humble way. According to me one who does not have a liking for the Urdu script has no liking for swaraj also. The masses do not  understand pure Hindi or pure Urdu, so Hindustani should be evolved in such a way that even the illiterate masses can understand it.
 Mere slogans would not help in achieving the goal of freedom. Taking as little trouble as possible and looking to your worldly advancement will leave your swaraj just a dream. Nagari and Urdu are
 
 both equally dear to me. So when I say learn the Urdu script I have no enmity towards the other script. Our swaraj cannot be given to us as a gift, but we shall have to win it through our untiring efforts.
 To understand our people and win swaraj for our country, do not be deterred from this small effort of learning the two important scripts of our land. To keep faith, one must be cent per cent faithful. It is not a bit of bread which you can break up in  pieces.  The  language of a people cannot be divided, it is one and indivisible like Truth. Therefore, whether you like it or not you will have to learn and love Urdu.
 Asked whether script should be given as much importance as language, Gandhiji replied:
Language and script are both necessary in practice. How are we,
 after all, to solve the question of writing to our own Muslim brethren who know only the other script? If we argue, ‘What have we to do with them?’, then I say why bother about swaraj? I want to learn all the thirteen scripts and want to know them equally well. Had you given one-seventh of the time to the learning of these scripts which you have given to English, you would have learnt all the thirteen scripts by now. It is not difficult to learn the Urdu script. It can be done with great ease and facility.
 A pracharak asked why the Urdu script should not be taught to the student after the Nagari is learnt. Mahatma said:
If I had been a teacher, I would have taught four or five scripts
 at the same time. I did not take even eight days to learn the Urdu script. There should at least be four or five such teachers who may know the two script perfectly and may be able to teach them. It could be left to the option of the teacher whether he taught the two scripts together or one after the other. But he should examine them in both before giving them a certificate.
 Regarding the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and Babu Purushottam Das Tandon’s attitude to the script issue, Mahatma Gandhi said:
Tandonji is my friend. I love him. We have lived together for a
 long time. But now, on this question, we are taking two different paths; but we do not stand in each other’s way. Personally, for myself, I want to see Saraswati after the union of Ganga and Jamuna.

	STATEMENT TO THE PRESS","
  	I have your letter, which has hurt me deeply. You have totally 	misunderstood what I said out of great love. I am helpless. What I 	had told you was never meant for the Press and so far as I am 	concerned I would like to say that whatever we have been writing to 	each other should not be sent to the Press. Still, you can send it 	if you think it fit. Excuse me for not replying in English. You 	think that if we write in Urdu orany other Indian language it can be 	misinterpreted, and if we write in English it can mean one thing 	only. But I hold exactly the opposite view.  From 	a copy of the Urdu: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal     WARDHA,  November 21, 1945 I had 	purposely refrained from correcting or contradicting reports about 	my shifting to Poona and establishing  a  nature  cure hospital 	on an extensive plot of ground in Poona or even Nasik. All  	this was wrong, as most unauthentic reports in the Press are. These 	have always cost me dear, perhaps the public more than me. There 	was, however, a grain of truth in the ounce of rumour. Dr. Dinshaw 	Mehta knew me before I knew him and, ever since I have known him,  I 	have liked him. I have been myself a nature cure man before all 	known to me. Of them, Dr. Dinshaw has made the greatest impression 	on me and he is a dreamer like me. He wants a nature cure 	university; so do I. He has made over to a Trust his concerns at 	Poona and Sinhgad. Their nominal cost, according to the schedules to 	the Trust, is, in round figures, Rs. 50,000. I have allowed myself 	to be one of the Trustees. The other two are Dr. Mehta himself and 	Mr. Jehangir Patel who is interested in nature cure. Hitherto Dr. 	Mehta’s institution has been meant for monied men and then for as 	many poor people as he could safely take. Patients have all been 	residential.  	From the 1st of January next, this institution will be devoted to 
 the service of the poor. The rich will be taken only if they can accommodate themselves to remain with the poor, and expect no more space or comforts than the poor will get at this institution. The guarantee will be that the standard of cleanliness, shorn of luxury, will be the highest attainable in any institution of the kind. Treatment will be both indoor and outdoor. Outdoor will naturally be more than indoor.
 The Birlas have interested themselves in me for years. And they were prepared to give me in Nasik as much land with buildings as were required for the institution. But Dr. Dinshaw was not whole- heartedly inclined to favour the Nasik idea, unless I consented to include in the Trust the going concerns at Poona too. I could not shoulder the burden. Hence the Nasik project had to be dropped, for the time being at any rate.libtech_686_footnotelibtech_687_footnoteDr.   Dinshaw  will  still  remain  the  sole Director so far as the technical part is concerned. This institution, if it is to grow at all, will require the silent blessings of the poor, the financial support of the rich, active co-operation of genuine naturopaths of India and sympathy of the medical fraternity.  Its present site is too small for the requirements of the poor. Moreover, it will largely depend upon the leaseholder whether the institution can in any case remain located on the present site.

	LETTER TO KAMALNAYAN BAJAJ","
  From a copy of the Gujarati: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal     SEVAGRAM, 
     CHI. 	KAMALNAYAN,  November 	22, 1945 
  	Since you will certainly not be back before I leave Sevagram, I am 	writing you this letter. You should know that the Nagpur Bank was 	Jamanalal’s, which he had started for the service of the people. 	The    
 idea was, and ought to be even now, that it should serve as a savings bank for the poor. The bank, therefore, must never crash. In other words, the Nagpur Bank should crash only when the Bank of England or the Imperial Bank do or when there is some great natural calamity. That is, it must have the reputation that it will be the last not the first to crash. That you are Jamnalal’s heir really means that you are heir to that reputation, and it was because of this belief of mine that I advised the Jallianwala Trust to let its funds remain in the Nagpur Bank and to try to transfer still more deposits to it. I have given the same advice to Kumarappa, nemely, that he should deposit the Village Industries Association’s funds in that Bank. That confidence must not prove to have been misplaced. But the moment I alighted at the railway station yesterday Bharatan told me quite the opposite. He of course spoke gently and since I am the President of the Association, asked for my opinion. Kumarappa had written to me and asked me whether he should  deposit  the  Village  Industries  funds   in   the   .   .   .   .libtech_690_footnotelibtech_691_footnoteBank. Vaikunthbhai had advised in favour of it and, therefore, Kumarappa had assumed that I also would agree. But I expressed doubt and did not give my consent. Kumarappa, however, had already deposited the money. But now we must withdraw it. In that case we shall lose the interest. And what if, despite our readiness to lose the interest, we cannot withdraw it. So Bharatan asked my advice. Kumarappa, is not here just now. But I told Bharatan that if the Bank people objected, we must put up a fight and insist on withdrawing the money, for otherwise I felt the money was insecure and it would be like killing a buffalo for a leather thong. I do not know even today what kind of an establishment the . . . Bank is. I do have some vague idea about it, of course. But I generally dislike and distrust new banks. I would not, therefore, readily agree to deposit money in them. Then the question arose: if not in the . . . Bank, why should we keep the money in the Nagpur Bank? Is it also not a comparatively new bank? Comparatively yes. Bharatan then added that it was being rumoured that the Nagpur Bank would close down in a month or two because it had incurred losses and it was feared that the deposits were not safe. He suggested, therefore, that it would be wise to withdraw the money in time. I did not believe the rumour and remained undisturbed in my mind, but I wanted to know what was at the back of the rumour. Radhakrishna was with me at the time. I asked him. He explained the position. I felt reassured and told Bharatan that we must deposit the money in the Nagpur Bank and nowhere else. However, I felt that I must inform you. Hence this letter. Think over this and be on your guard. It is no
 
 
 ordinary matter to be Jamnalal’s heir. You are his heir because you are his son. I am his heir because I am his adopted father. My interest is to see that his name remains untarnished. You and I shall have proved ourselves his true heirs only if the ventures he started are not merely kept up but become models of their kind.
 It may be that you will earn a lot of money and be reckoned a millionaire. But what is to happen to the philanthropic ventures and the Bank he started in the last years of his life? What is to happen to the cause of the poor cow, of khadi, of the Village Industries Association? Did I not settle at Wardha at his behest, ignoring Sardar’s anger born out of his love? He could have easily secured for me ten orchards against one here, but he could not find for me a Jamnalal there and, therefore, I let go the ten orchards. And now, I do not wish even to feel that I have lost Jamnalal. This rests entirely in your hands, in Radhakrishna’s and Janakidevi’s. Janakidevi, however, is uneducated and the hope of her shaping up which I had cherished has dried up after Jamnalal’s passing away. I therefore cannot explain to her the position about the Bank and have not even tried. Radhakrishna is very clever. He has practical sense but cannot be  said  to  be educated. You have been to England and have, besides, made some mark as a business man. As for self-confidence, you have more of it than is good for you. Be that as it may, as heir to Jamnalal and head of the family it is to you that I have to look up. I, therefore, advise you to do the best you can to bring glory to your father’s name as a philanthropist. If you think it beyond your capacity, be humble and caution me in time. Not all sons can or do follow in the footsteps of their benevolent fathers. If, therefore, you also fail to do so, nobody can point a finger at you. And in any case who am I to do so? But as a grandfather I should at least advise you and caution you. Having done so, I would quietly accept what you do. I think I have said enough. Ponder over it carefully and let me know, at any rate, whether the advice I have given to Bharatan is correct or not.

675,"November 22, 1945",675. TALK TO STUDENTS OF SAMAGRA GRAMSEVA VIDYALAYA libtech_692_footnote,"
 SEVAGRAM,
 November 22, 1945
 I expect much from the students who have come here for study. Not only I but also those who take interest in this work, expect much from you. There are many educated people in India who criticize and run down our programme. Some of them oppose it on principle. At present I do not want to say anything about them, though I have a ready answer for them. But we should listen to those who have some interest in this work and wish to take some part in it. Such people hope for much from khadi work, village industries, goseva and work of Harijan uplift. We should therefore make strenuous efforts to fulfil their expectations. If you have come here in order merely to earn your livelihood, then that hope will not be realized.
 Many people study in Government colleges. They get degrees there. They think that with that education they will earn money and fame and at least become clerks in some Government office, or if not, they can certainly get jobs as peons. And they become peons not for the sake of work, but in the hope of getting promotions in future and making some money on the side. This means that they believe that once they enter Government service, their life is secure. This is a matter which needs careful thinking. The Government has provided several facilities in their colleges. They have provided spacious buildings, offered large scholarships and given travelling facilities. How can we compete with all this?
 I have already shown several ways of solving this problem. You have not come here for comforts or for the sake of salary. If you want to succeed in your aim bear in mind that you have not come here merely to learn crafts. Of course you have to learn crafts but you should not rest content with that. Artisans are already there in villages. They have been doing the same work from generation to generation. How can you compete with them? Do learn the process, but along with that you must acquire scientific knowledge. We should think again and again why we are doing this work, how we should proceed about it, how we can link it with swaraj. Swaraj has to be attained through non-violence. There are crores of people living in the villages of
 
 India. We have to emancipate them, serve them and make them understand the value of this work. If you believe that the mill-owners can feed the people and if you are satisfied with it then you should not study here. But the mill-owners can provide for only a handful. Mill-owners never think at all of the crores of people. I have not come across any mill-owner so far who has told me that mills can provide work for the millions.
 You have come here to accomplish a Herculean task. You have to serve crores of people. It is immaterial that you are only sixty-one in number. But you will have accomplished something if you leave after gaining scientific knowledge. All the sixty-one of you have to become guardians or trustees for the millions of people. If your example is followed, the number will increase. This Vidyalaya is like the Gangotrilibtech_693_footnote. Its flow will swell like that of the Ganga. This has been my dream for the last 25 years. The hope that I have cherished has not yet been fulfilled. Still I am not disappointed at all because I never lose heart. A great enterprise does not move quickly. Non-violence marches forward slowly but steadily. Its way is straight. It will overtake those who move with the speed of an aeroplane. This is my firm belief.
 The knowledge that you gain here is to be imparted to the villa- gers. You have to create interest in them for such knowledge. But this is not an easy task. I have been here in Sevagram for the last so many years. The headquarters of the Charkha Sangh, Gramodyog Sangh, Goseva Sangh and so on are situated here. There are very good workers also. The facilities that are not available anywhere else are available here. In spite of all this, I have not been able to do what I wanted to do. But you should not lose heart because of that. You should ask yourselves why we have not been able to  do  it.  The teachers should have an answer for this. Those who are sitting here are neither hypocrites nor cheats. They are sitting here with a firm belief that sooner or later the key to this problem will come into their hands. We have to multiply Sevagrams. We have to think not of a single village but the whole of India. I sometimes think of the whole world as well. If we had to take care of Sevagram only or had to work without concern for non-violence and truth, then we could have accomplished the work but that would not have removed the sufferings of this world. India is a tiny spot in the world and in it Sevagram is but a speck. Whatever is possible in Sevagram can also be possible in the world. I am prepared to spend 100 years for it.
I shall teach you whatever I know if you are prepared to learn it
 
 with patience. But it will not help you to earn money. I can easily earn a thousand or two thousand rupees. I stayed for 20 years in South Africa, I can speak some broken English also. Moreover, these days I am considered a mahatma too ! So anybody will give me two thousand rupees. But I don’t want all this. On the strength of it I can collect crores of rupees, but not for myself. So far as I am concerned I want nothing more than plain bread. In the same way you should also be content with plain bread. The work here is not easy. If you are not satisfied with the work here you should leave. You can earn enough money elsewhere but if you wish to stay here, you should stay with a contented mind. If you have this feeling that you are one with the millions, then you will succeed.
 You have come here from different Provinces. You eat together and live together. Your heart should be clean and you should feel that we are all one. I have started saying that we are all Harijans—indeed Bhangis. Only when you imbibe such an attitude, will our work succeed. You will have to be alert every moment and carry on the work. You will be examined and you will be given a certificate. But that will not prove your worth. The certificate will not be for showing to others. It will enable you to know that you have reached a certain standard and that you have to proceed further. Today certificates do carry weight but we have to change our values, change our way of life and also our attitude towards these things.

  	I am dictating this in Gujarati in order to save time. I got your 	letter. I had expected to see you here, instead of which I saw your 	letter full of real distress. It was not the lamentation usual in 	your letters. I felt in it, instead, your sorrow at having fallen 	ill at the wrong moment. I too, therefore, felt unhappy. Maganbhailibtech_694_footnotelibtech_695_footnote, too, gave me a vivid  description.

 CHI. CRAZY MADALASA,
 I have your letter. Now that Shrimanji is there, do as he advises. You have too many advisers. That is bad. You should listen only to one person whom you respect and follow his advice. Do not listen to anybody else, and if someone comes to talk to you just close your ears. You will then quickly recover. And don’t worry in any case. Since you have given birth to a child, you must bring him up well. It will be enough if, for his sake at least, you can forget your craziness and become, if not a jnani, at least a sensible woman.

 BHAI GADODIAJI,
 I got all your letters and Dr. Sharma’s and quite a number of them, I may say, but I did not think it proper to get involved in all these things. Now I see that I shall have to devote some time to the matter. You emphatically proclaim your honesty and I have as yet no reason to doubt it. You have already given me the reason for believing that your conscience is clear and I have accepted it despite opposition from others. But the attacks of Dr. Sharma and others on your attitude towards khadi have shaken my opinion. I wrote one or two strong
 letters to Dr. Sharma. I am sending you the letter I got in reply. He insists that it should be sent to you. You can give whatever reply you want to and send it along with his letter.
 I am writing this letter with a heavy heart. Dr. Sharma’s complaint is not a new one. He had the same complaint when he had come to see me a few months after my release from jail. But I did not pay much attention to it. Let Chi. Saraswati also read this letter. She may also say what she has to.

  	I write this in continuation of my letterlibtech_705_footnotelibtech_706_footnoteof 	10th October. Since then I have seen other such accounts in the 	papers and now I have with me a young man (Shri Prabhu Dayal 	Vidyarthi) who came to me while he was yet in his teens, without 	being  recommended  by anybody, as a poor youngster. This was in the 	year 1935. Ever since then he has never been out of my observation. 	He was arrested in connection with the 1942  disturbances, and has 	lately  been discharged. He came to Wardha in a dilapidated 	condition. I was then at Poona. He reported his arrival and I 	telegraphed to him to come there so that I could look after him 	better and, if necessary, get Dr. Mehta’s assistance at his 	sanatorium where I was staying. He narrates tales of terrible 	torture, into the details of which I do not wish to go at this 	stage.libtech_707_footnote  	On top of this I have received a communication from  Dr. Lohia’s 	friends and they tell me that Dr. Lohia has gone through torture 	himself. He is an able, cultured man who sacrificed a position of 	ease and luxury for the sake of the cause of India’s independence. 	 I know him well and, through him, also his father.  	It is difficult to disbelieve all the accounts that have appeared in 	the Press and the two incidents mentioned above. I suggest that His 	Excellency goes deeper into the matter and not reject the statements 	as an exag-geration undeserving of any attention. I take comfort 	from the fact that in your letter of 1st November in reply to mine 	of 10th October, you telllibtech_708_footnoteme that though His Excellency believes the story to be 	exaggerated, he is making further investigations. I plead for 	investigation into all other such statements and, if he proposes to 	do so, I am prepared to send you such details as I possess about the 	two        Transfer 	of Power, “Memorial 	to Lord Elgin”, 8-11-1906

About Sarala’s 	education I have made it clear to her that while she stays here, she 	can neither have tuition from outside nor expect any other special 	facilities. She can receive only the education available here and 	she has to do as much work for the Ashram as her body will permit. 	She will have to be content with the food provided here and she will 	have to bear all expenses. She already knows spinning and other 	activities.   Efforts 		should be 		made gently to 		make Kanjibhai 		abide by 		the rules or 		else he must be 		suffered with 		love. Only love 		can understand the 		language of 		love. It would be a 		crime to 		make a 		mechanical approach.  I 		have already 		had a 		talk with Kailasbehn. 		She will 		stay in the 		Ashram. This 		is a 		similar problem. Here 		too the key lies 		in love. 		The same 		applies to Om Prakash.  I 		would love to 		keep Govind in 		the Talimi 		Sangh but only 		if Sankaran 		is convinced.  I 		do not 		know anything 		about Mavjibhai. 		I have 		just met him 		and his wife. With 		regard to 		them do 		what Kishorelalbhai 		and Naraharibhai say. There 		is nothing 		to be said 		about Govind Reddy.  I 		should be 		happy to 		make the 		acquaintance of Mohan 		Singhjilibtech_715_footnotebut I have no time. I would like to utilize his services as a blacksmith 		and carpenter.  While 		looking after 		the management, it 		will be 		good if 		you can take 		classes in 		the spare 		time. But I 		too have 		looked after the 		management, haven’t 		I? For 		me management 		itself had 		become a [training] 		class. I was 		a teacher 		as well 		as a pupil. 		The manager 		keeps an eye on everyone and sees how he sits, how he eats and what he      
 reads. If within this framework, you can have a class, it will be all right. For instance, at Kocharab, all education was given in  the Ashram. I had made a list of all those who were qualified to teach. Probably only one or two hours were reserved for teaching. I had assigned some work to myself too and I used to do my share.
  Workers 	have got to 	learn all 	the processes concerning 	cotton. Let 	this instruction be 	imparted at 	Khadi Vidyalaya. The 	three R’s must be 	taught. I 	shall not be 	able to 	go into the details 	of how 	it is to be done.  Even if Vinoba takes selections from Al Fatehalibtech_716_footnotelibtech_717_footnoteand  Mazdalibtech_718_footnoteit will 	have to be in Arabic 	and Pehlavi. 	They can be 	accompanied by 	Vinoba’s translation 	to bring 	out the meaning. 	In my view 	there is 	some value in 	reciting them 	in the 	original. I 	do not 	take the position that everything 	should be 	in the mother tongue 	or the 	national language. You 	are right.  What 	you say is correct. 	I am 	used to 	one room only and I 	have not had two 	separate rooms. It 	is the same thought 	with a 	slight difference 	at the Christ 	Seva Sangh. I 	have written at 	length about clothing. 	Go through it.  Now 	I myself 	take spices. 	But I 	hope I 	do that 	only by way 	of medicine. I 	take them at 	the instance 	of Dr. 	Mehta but 	I am 	not even 	aware of their 	existence in 	my food. The 	significant change 	is that 	we have 	now realized 	they have as much 	place in medicine 	as they 	have in taste. 	Wheat is cooked 	in so many 	different ways for taste 	and we 	also make roti out 	of it to fill 	the stomach.  The 	quantity of 	milk is 	all right. 	Maybe, even one 	lb. is enough.  Gajraj 	has started 	going to the 	Talimi Sangh. I 	think we 	should keep him 	there full time.  Think 	things over and 	write to me further 	if you 	wish. There are two 	sides to it. Write to Purushottam Gandhilibtech_719_footnotelibtech_720_footnotein this regard. Consider 	in this matter 	the person 	concerned and the 
 
 convenience of the Ashram. I may agree to allow a deserving person [to stay in the Ashram] even for eight days.

700,,"WHY THE INSISTENCE ON THE YARN CLAUSE
libtech_724_footnote","
    
 November 27/28, 1945
 This is an old argument.libtech_725_footnotelibtech_726_footnoteOne wants to do many good things but is too lazy. However, when a rule is made the work becomes easy. Then one finds that one has gained the strength to do the work one could not do before. By making the yarn clause compulsory, we do not coerce people. We only make it easy for those who want to spin. How long can they spin who have no heart in it? It will be hypocritical if they spin as a demonstration. Hyprocrites only do harm to themselves. They cannot harm khadi in any way. I would in fact go so far as to say that he who takes up spinning out of a desire for praise will gradually develop an interest in the activity and then continue to spin willingly. If even after long practice he cannot find interest in spinning, if he still finds it a tedium he will give up khadi. That will not harm us in any way.
 If the khadi bhandars close down because of the yarn clause they well may. And I do not care whether anyone buys khadi or not. I do not wish to run a shop. I want people to learn spinning. In Bombay 300 or 350 charkhas are plied. But this number means nothing. What I want is that there should be as many charkhas plying there as there are homes. If the cities are to imbibe non-violence there is no other way. The Government have the force that destroys; I have the charkha. The charkha alone can save us from destructive force. All other methods are useless.
 If the enforcement of the yarn clause results in reduced sales of khadi and if the consequent loss forces us to close down the khadi bhandars, we may close them down. We cannot maintain khadi bhandars to sell khadi. You will say that if khadi bhandars in the city close down we shall have to sell khadi in the villages and that khadi cannot sell in the villages as it can in the cities. I agree that khadi cannot sell in the villages and it should not. Khadi is not to be sold in the villages, it is to be worn there. It is to be spun and worn. Rather than that we should have to get licences from the Government for khadi bhandars it is better that khadi dies, it is better that the khadi
 
 khadi should be allowed to buy it for cash, and that making the tendering of yarn compulsory would amount to coercion.
 
 shops close down. Khadi cannot survive if it has to depend on others for its survival. Then it will be its lot to disappear. Once you understand the idea behind khadi you will not be nervous. You will not wonder how khadi bhandars and khadi centres will carry on. Since we have taken that step, since we have dared, we must be prepared to face difficulties. If we have to suffer set-backs we must be prepared for it.
 You ask about woollens and silks. Who wears them? Can the poor do so? Why should we take all the trouble for a few rich people? These things cannot become universal. We may certainly keep stocks of woollens and silks in khadi bhandars as we keep other things there but we must understand that that is no part of our work. We may not apply the yarn clause to woollens and silks. We may not ask for yarn when selling these. Do we ask for yarn when selling other village handicrafts? Woollens and silks come in that category. If we remain steadfast, the importance of khadi will not diminish. If we think of meeting the expenditure of khadi bhandars out of the proceeds from the sale of woollens and silks, it will not help khadi, it will only harm it. If we carry on the khadi activity with the help of woollens and silks we shall become crippled. We shall not be able to carry on with the khadi work. Khadi work can sustain itself. It does not require dependence on anyone.
 No one can kill khadi. How can mills do so? Mills may themselves be destroyed. We do not worry on that account. All the activities concerned with khadi, right from the picking of cotton to the weaving of khadi, should be carried on by the khadi bhandars. Selling of khadi is only a minor activity. Kakubhai is the secretary of the Bombay khadi bhandar. I want to see how skilled he is. I want to see in his hand not a pen but a charkha. He should be an expert in all the processes employed in khadi. If I were in a bhandar I would spin, I would card. We have to teach people spinning and weaving through the bhandars. Today we do try to teach people how to ply the  charkha. But if khadi is to reach every home we must teach people ginning, carding and all the other processes. I do not much care for buying slivers. One should make slivers oneself. Today  machine- made slivers are used. The practice must stop. Everyone should card his own cotton, make his own slivers and then spin. Only then can we say that we have adopted khadi. I have become a lover of hand- carding. Even inferior cotton such as mathia, hand-carded, can yield yarn of the fineness of 20 counts. The mills cannot produce yarn of a count higher than six or seven from this cotton. I prefer hand-carding to carding with a bow. It does not expose one to the risk either of consumption or asthma. Even a queen in her palace can easily take
 this up. Even children and old men can card and make slivers. It is a simple and easy activity.
 Today we must not think of spreading khadi by carrying it about on our backs and hawking it. We have not to give anyone ready-made khadi. We shall say, ‘take this charkha, take this cotton, card it, make slivers and spin. Get the weaver in your village to weave it and then wear it.’ I would in fact say that the khadi bhandars not only should not have khadi, they should not even have slivers and cotton. If people demand them we may give them cotton and the necessary tools and arrange for spinning to be taught. You will then see that the country will have no dearth of khadi or cloth as such. Cloth is frequently rationed and still cloth famine persists. I  can remove it. If I was made responsible for it, I could provide cloth to everyone. I am going to Bengal. If they do as I desire, I shall see that there will be no cloth famine there.
 You ask if you should provide khadi for hospitals. For where will the patients find yarn, how will they be able to spin? Similarly there are the Congress committees, the district boards, the banks. Then there are exhibitions, Congress meetings and so on, which require khadi worth thousands of rupees. Where can they all find the yarn? Would it not be right to give them khadi without insisting on yarn being tendered? I say that if these institutions cannot tender yarn they should give up the idea of khadi. They can borrow the yarn, they can make their members spin or they can obtain it from friends. I want to allow no exceptions to the rule. I have taken in hand the nature cure clinic of Dinshaw Mehta at Poona. Do you think I can use mill cloth there? I said to Dinshaw, ‘I shall give you my yarn and you can buy khadi in exchange.’ Everyone will have to give yarn, be he a raja or a maharaja.
 The yarn clause allows for buying yarn from the neighbours, but this is against my intention. I do not want this. What I have said is that people may take yarn from their neighbour but they may not pay for it. We do not take things from our friends by paying for them. That would be commerce. If we do not have something we take it from the neighbours and later when we get it ourselves, we return it. As a good neighbour he may not take it back but in any case no payment is involved.
 There is in the resolution also the provision for one’s servant doing the spinning. It is the same as the members of one’s family spinning and one tendering the yarn in one’s name. But it would not be right if someone were to employ a servant specifically for spinning because that is the same as buying the yarn. If a servant employed for
 
 household work spends a little time on spinning for his employer we can have no objection. At the Times of India office, Bombay, they wanted some khadi. They came to me and asked, ‘Where shall we find the yarn?’ I said, ‘You have so many peons and workers in your office who do nothing but paste addresses. Allow them an hour or two every day for spinning. Teach them the art. And use the yarn so produced to buy khadi.’
 I suggested spinning clubs being organized in cities. But I see a different meaning has been put upon what I had said. The Club at Bombay became an agency for the sale of yarn.  Workers  are employed who spin for wages and then people buy the  yarn  to procure their khadi from the bhandars. This is to murder truth. What I had said was that since large cities are too cramped and people have to live in very small rooms where there is no space for spinning or keeping the charkha or carding, clubs should be organized in various localities and in the precincts of khadi bhandars where people could go to card, make slivers and spin.
 This could remedy the lack of space for spinning. Also it would be easier to arrange for instruction in spinning. But the clubs that have been started are of a totally different kind and they should be discontinued. We should not leave hold of truth. We must not deceive ourselves. We must give up the lure of selling khadi. We should now develop an interest in teaching khadi. If this results in the sale of khadi stopping we should not mind it. But the  khadi  of  my conception can only prosper by this means.
 You ask what should be the character of the Bombay khadi bhandar now. I myself am anxious to make my idea clear. In the first place we must shift the bhandar  from a central market like Kalabadevi. We should take it to a suburb such as Dadar or Vile [Parle], where we can find enough space. The work of the bhandar also should undergo change. The manager will not try and persuade people to buy khadi. He will sit in the bhandar and spin on the takli. His co-workers will do the same. He will talk to the customers and try to explain to them the new khadi policy. If someone is willing to learn spinning he will teach him. He will not use ready-made slivers. He will teach all the processes. beginning with hand-carding. He will also gather at the bhandar some artisans. He will have looms operated where the yarn spun can be woven. He will have charkhas and other implements manufactured. He will repair the implements of the customers. The surroundings of the bhandar will be clean and the air
 will be pure. There will be cleanliness. The charkhas will be in proper order and the atmosphere will be congenial for spinning. It will also have facilities for selling khadi. The Bombay bhandar up to now has been a clearing-house. It will still be that though in a different way. So long we only worried about what the Bombay customers wanted. If a handkerchief of a particular design was in vogue we told the production centres to make such handkerchiefs. If it was a sari with a particular border we told the Andhra people to make such saris. We even used to send representatives of the bhandars to those far away places to explain what exactly was wanted. We took up printing saris at Masulipatnam. It revived a dying craft. But if we do not now change our method of work the same thing will be the undoing of khadi. Now the centres will have to meet the needs of the areas around them. They have to produce things with that end in view. In the matter of designs they do not have to follow the directives of the Bombay bhandar. Bombay will have to accept whatever varieties and designs are left and be content with that. It is no part of our duty to provide to the cities the designs they want. Our duty is only to teach how people can produce things that they want.
 That is the reason why I want the bhandars to be shifted from a central bazaar. Take some place on the outskirts of the city which is attractive. Create beauty in wilderness. It is said that the English once had their factory on the banks of the Tapti on the outskirts of Surat, from where they started running the country. They wanted to suppress the khadi and other village industries of India. Our mission will be to revive them. If some stray artisan happens to come to you, put him at a loom. Start the work of carding, spinning and such other activities. Let a model village grow up there. Make the khadi bhandar  an attractive centre. Those who seek peace from the noise of Bombay will go there on Saturdays if not every day. They will buy their khadi and learn carding. If you make things you need in the village way the city folk may also find an interest in such activity.
 If you talk about our responsibility to the people of Bombay I shall ask: ‘What responsibility?’ If the people of Bombay continue their old interest, what shall we do? Will you be able to interest yourselves in horse-racing, gambling, cinema, theatre, dancing? What can you do about people who want to pursue these? Yes, if they want the facility to live in the style of a village we may invite them. That will be doing our duty. You say that in a city like Bombay where people are politically conscious we can make khadi a success only if
 we are able to persuade them that the success of our political work depends on our pursuing this new khadi policy. I shall only answer that khadi has value to me only if it is a symbol of ahimsa. An American once said that it was not words that grew but it was the work. Your success will depend on what kind of khadi bhandars and what kind of surroundings for them you can create with your faith and tapascharya.

 November 28, 1945 Whatever work regarding education is carried on under the Kasturba Nidhi, whether it is for children or adults, should be given
only through manual labour and handicrafts.
 Trained teachers will be required to carry on this work properly. Arrangements should be made to give training to these teachers in registered training schools.
 So long as such teachers are not ready, education can be  imparted through manual labour and handicrafts but instruction in handicrafts should also be given in a proper way.
 The teachers should study the literature of Nayee Talim and carry on their work on those lines as far as possible till they get properly trained.

 SEVAGRAM,
     CHI. 	VANUDI,  November 	28, 1945 
  	I got your letter. I have no doubt about your purity, nor about your 	firmness of mind. But if you yourself have some doubt, however 	faint, regarding the propriety of what you do, you should carefully 	think over it and change your habits suitably. Suppose, for 	instance, you tell somebody in jest that you are married and have a  	few children, and add that your mother-in-law is dead. Such jokes 	are 
 permissible, but the dangers in them are easy to see. That is why even in the highest circles we still hear criticism of certain things that take place in theatres. If a married man acts the part of Rama in a play and  a woman married to another man that of Sita, how far is that desirable for both? It also requires to be seriously considered what kind of effect such Rama and Sita produce on the spectators. That carried away by the modern trend we may do or like improper things or see others doing that is altogether a different matter. I do not wish to dwell at length on this, nor have I the time for that. But you are a thoughtful girl and I have, therefore, put before you in a few words an important question for you to think over.
 I hope you keep good health, and trust that all of you devote yourselves to keeping the Arogya Bhavan clean in every possible manner. You have with you many visitors now. Use the services of them all in cleaning up the place. I am trying to send Munnalal there.  I expect he will arrive there in about a week.

  	I got your postcard, as also the report sent by you. The latter 	seems to have been drafted by you. If so, your English is weak. 	Ordinarily this should not count as a deficiency in one, but in 	India it is; for we take pride, though we ought not to, in being 	able to speak and write a foreign language correctly. I am a lover 	of all languages and take scrupulous care to write correctly, but I 	am more eager to convey my meaning and am not scared of making 	mistakes. Were it not so, I would never have been able to speak in 	Hindi and other languages. Having said this, my criticism of the 	report is that its  English is not correct. I have no time to revise 	it and return it. The report itself is good and, therefore, I show 	it to everybody who is interested in it. I am now sending it to 	Jajuji to read.  	I shall not feel sorry that you will be breaking up  an organization 	which you have brought into being. Your leaving it will amount to 	breaking it. I only hope that your action will not be an expression 	of the rashness and anger which I have observed in your nature. 	Sometimes it becomes one’s dharma to humbly cling to the 	organization one has set up, despite the co-workers’ coolness 	towards oneself. I have been doing this from a much earlier age than 	you are at present and it has certainly benefited me. Endurance is a 	virtue worth cultivating. You are a student of the Gita. 	Ponder the profound truths contained in it. After cautioning you 	thus, I unreservedly accept your decision. If you teach the students 	who come to you and take 
 more intimate interest in their lives, you may perhaps be able to create another organization with their help. In future lay stress from the very beginning on all the processes relating to cotton. I have come to realize from daily experience that this is of the utmost importance.
My good wishes for the result of your examination.

I have your letter as also Jehangir’s.
 I do wish to offer you some suggestions but that will be when I can spare the time. For the present I shall say only this much. Give full encouragement to those who are engaged in the cleaning activity. You must also pay as much attention to it as you can while doing your own work. You will have already decided to dispose of all the furniture. You can take it to Bombay and sell it there to recover the price or if you want me to dispose of it you will let me know, so that I may make arrangements from wherever I am. We shall not sell it at a throw-away price.
 Bhai Munnalal will be going there in six or seven days. He will take part in the cleaning activity. I think he can keep the accounts and do for you whatever shopping there is to be done. He is well versed in all the three things and has done them all before. I understand that Mr. Mange is looking after the accounts and shopping. I wish to keep him entirely out of all this. I have no doubt that he should train himself for something else. He should become a naturopath.  He should also educate himself. If you wish that Munnalal should not go there in my absence or if you have any other plans, you can send a
 wire to the Ashram. It is necessary that what we wish to startlibtech_728_footnotefrom January 1 should be started at home as early as possible.

  	I was glad to have your letter. I would like to have a copy of the 	order you have mentioned. I just cannot agree to what you say. I 	think there is some misunderstanding. You had better ask Jawaharlal 	also and write to me at Calcutta. There I shall be staying with 	Satis Babu at Khadi Pratishthan, Sodepur.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal          The 		object of 		the constructive 		programme is stated 		to be the 		preparation of 		the people 		for a 		non-violent political 		order. Is this 		definition correct? Or 		will it 		be better 		to define 		such a social 		and political 		order as one in which 		no one would 		be able to exploit 		the labour 		of another?  A. 	Your definition is correct but it is incomplete. In what way 	it is 	incomplete will be explained in the answer to your next question.  Q. 	If my definition 	is correct 	I feel 	such a social 	and political 	order can be 	achieved theoretically 	even by 	our making 	the largest 	use of 	machinery. In 	that case 	is it necessary 	to have 	the maximum 	number of village 	industries for the 	non-violent political 	order? If so why?  A. Non-violence cannot be 	divided into compartments. Non- violence is an inherent attribute of 	man or, at any rate, it should be an attribute of man during his 	waking hours. Devotion to non-violence is the highest expression of 	his conscious state. If we thus conceive ahimsa we should satisfy 	all our necessities by the labour of our    
 hands. If we do not do this we shall have to depend upon other powers and as long as such condition persists we shall be unable to realize a state of fearless-ness. Another danger in making more and more use of machinery is that we have to make great efforts for the protection of it, that is to say,
 we shall have to keep an army as is being done today elsewhere in the world. The fact is that even if there is no danger of aggression from outside we shall be slaves to those who will be in control of the big machinery. Take the case of the atom bomb. Those nations who have atom bombs are feared even by their friends. If we take a wise view, we shall be saved from the working of machinery.
 Q. One of the reasons given in favour of hand-spinning is that it makes one self-sufficient. Can one who is self-sufficient serve society better than one who is dependent on others? Do you mean to say that there is such a connection between self-sufficiency and social service that the more one is self-sufficient the more is one’s capacity for social service?
A. In order to satisfy this doubt also we will have to keep in
 mind the non-violent outlook because truth and non-violence form the foundation of the order of my conception. Our first duty is that we should not be a burden on society, i.e., we should be self- sufficient. That means self-sufficiency by itself is a kind of service. After becoming self-sufficient we shall use our spare time for the service of others. If all become self-sufficient no one will have any difficulty. In that case no one will be required to undertake service of others. But we have not yet reached that stage and therefore we have to think of social service. Even if we succeed in realizing complete self-sufficiency, man being a social animal we shall have to accept service in some form or other. That is, man is as much dependent on others as he is dependent on himself. When dependence becomes necessary in order to keep society in good order it is no longer dependence but becomes co-operation. There is a fragrance in co- operation and there is no one weak or strong among the co-operators. Everyone is equal. There is a feeling of helplessness in dependency. Members of a family are as much self-dependent as interdependent, but there is no feeling of mine or thine. That is why they are called co-operators. Similarly when we take a society, a nation or the entire mankind as a family all men become co-operators. If we can conceive  a picture of such co-operation we shall find that there is no need of depending upon lifeless machines. Or we shall have to use them the least, not the most, and therein lies the real security and self-protection of society.
 
 Q. You lay more emphasis on spinning than on agriculture. Is there any political reason behind it? Or is it because people cannot take to farming as easily as they can to spinning?
A. I do not make such divisions as social, economic and
 political. What is political is also social and economic. One includes the others. It is true that we make and have to make such divisions for clarity of understanding. One of the reasons why I have not laid stress on agriculture is that even my knowledge of it is almost nil. How will I be able to enlighten you if I put emphasis on it? It is not so in the case of the charkha. I have acquired enough knowledge of it. Secondly under foreign rule the charkha had died out; it had been destroyed. Agriculture can never be destroyed but its form has been so changed that it has increased the slavery of the people. The third reason for putting emphasis on the charkha is that skill of hand has a very small place in agriculture. There is hardly any other industry in which the hands and the fingers are so much used as they are in the various processes that go to make khadi. The fourth reason is that foreign power first takes hold of the land and through it controls the other things. Therefore Government help is very necessary for improvement in agriculture. For these and other similar reasons I have laid more emphasis on hand-spinning.
 Q.   One of the features of the material development of human society appears  to be that man is tending to move more and more from self-sufficiency to dependency. Don’t you think this tendency is not right and that there will be revival of the opposite tendency?
 A. I take this question to  mean  that  society  is  advancing towards machinery. If I have understood the question  right,  my answer is that society must get rid of its slavery to the machine. By being slaves to the machine our slavery to our senses and their activity also increases immensely.
 Q. Are you confident that the constructive programme will be able to achieve  its object during your lifetime by mere propaganda? Don’t you think taking into consideration human frailties (lust, anger, greed, infatuation, pride and jealousy) that there will be need for “legislative aid”libtech_729_footnoteto make the people take to the constructive programme on any wide scale especially in this machine age? Will there be any violation of the principle of non-violence in taking such help from the elected representatives of the people? If so how?
 A. I have said many a time that we will have to take help from the Government on our own terms. Not only that, we will have to take help from the whole world There was a time when I felt that we could have only the barest minimum of help from the legislators in the matter of constructive programme. But now I have come to realize
 that if the representatives of the people go into the legislatures we can secure their help. Along with this we must bear in mind that we cannot appreciate the value of the constructive programme properly if we cannot carry it on in adverse circumstances. Other people of course can’t. I can say dispassionately but from experience that the strength of the people has increased in proportion to the progress of the constructive programme. If we can make the constructive programme universal and get it implemented through the people, then swaraj is in our hands.

711,"November 30, 1945","FOREWORD TO “GANDHIAN
		CONSTITUTION FOR FREE INDIA”","
    
 Perhaps the expression “Gandhian Constitution” is not a fitting title   for   Principal   Agrawal’slibtech_739_footnotepages.   It   may   be   acceptable   as   a convenient and compact title. The framework is really Principal Agrawal’s, based on his study of my writings. He has been interpreting them for a number of years. And as he is anxious not to
 
 misinterpret them in any way he would publish nothing without my seeing it. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is obvious. The disadvantage lies in the reader mistaking the particular writing being my view in every detail. Let me then warn him against making any such mistake. If I were to commit myself to every word appearing in these pages, I might as well write the thing myself. Though I have endeavoured to read the constitution twice, with as much attention as I was able to bestow on it during my other engagements, I could not undertake to check every thought and every word of it. Nor would my sense of propriety and individual freedom permit me to commit any such atrocity. All, therefore, I am able to say is that the brochure contains ample evidence of the care bestowed upon it by the author to make it as accurate as he could. There is nothing in it which has jarred on me as inconsistent with what I would like to stand for.
 The author was good enough to make such alterations as I thought were necessary.
 The word “constitution” must not mislead the reader into thinking that the author has made any profession to give him a complete constitution. He has made it perfectly clear in the beginning pages that he has only laid down broad lines to indicate what a constitution of my conception would be. I regard Principal Agrawal’s to be a thoughtful contribution to the many attempts at presenting India with constitutions. The merit of his attempt consists in the fact that he has done what for want of time I have failed to do.

		SANGH","
    
 
 November 30, 1945
 Yesterday I went to see the Talimi Sangh hostel. You know Hoshiaribehnlibtech_740_footnotelibtech_741_footnotewho stays in the Ashram. I have sent her son Gajraj to your school. He insisted that I should see his school. Even yesterday morning he came and said: “You will come, won’t you?” I said: “What shall I do at your school? I would rather see the place where you sleep.” I had intended to send his mother too. Anyway, I went there after my morning walk to keep my promise. I was pained by what I saw there. I noticed filth and mismanagement which should not have been there. I had not wanted to spend much time there, but I could not bear what I saw there and spent half an hour  or threequarters of an hour explaining things to Pandey.
 I found there were puddles of water in front of the verandah of the children’s hospital. It offended the eye. The children wash themselves right there. This breeds mosquitoes and so much of water is wasted. We should collect the water in a tub. Or we may wash beside the trees near by. If there were a thousand boys it would be a disaster. Going through the room I found the same thing in front of the verandah on the other side.
 Then I went to the children’s dormitory. Even at the entrance there was a lot of dirt. I went in. Mats were not properly kept. I had the bedding of a boy unrolled. It was very dirty. The bed-sheet was torn. It was stitched in a couple of places, but very crudely. The other tears had not been attended to. They should have been patched. If the sheet was too badly torn it could have been doubled and stitched. Many times in jail I had got mattresses made that way. They are warm and strong. The cotton of the mattress had collected into big lumps. It was not warm. That cotton should have been taken out and carded again. Several pieces of cloth were discovered from under the mattress. They were very dirty. I would have kept those pieces clean and used them for patching. The mat was very dirty. It should have been washed.
 
 I examined the floor. It is used for sleeping but is in a very bad state. Pandey said cow-dung was not available. It is better if cow-dung is available. But one can do without it. Where was there cow-dung in South Africa? We managed with earth. There was a wooden shelf fixed to the wall for keeping things. When I touched it my hand was covered with dust. I wiped my hand on Pandey’s hand. It also got covered with dust. One boy had put his ink-pot on the mat. Where else was the poor boy to put it? But there was no method about it. I examined each and every pen and nib. I saw also the ink-pots. That is my way. That should also be the way of Nayee Talim. Everything was wrong from my point of view. These are small things. But small things make up big things. It does not required money. It requires a keen vision, it requires art. It is our duty to teach these. It is the purpose of Nayee Talim. It is the teacher’s fault if it is not done. It is your fault. I would say that it is my fault. After all, the responsibility lies with me. What is the point in starting a thing and then giving it up? If someone says that in this way he can look after only one boy, I would say admit only one boy. Do not admit more. An element of untruth enters if we admit more boys and cannot look after them.
 As I came out, I noticed the sacking you have hung up along the verandah. For this I must quarrel with you. A verandah is designed to admit air and sunlight. By fixing sacking around it you shut out both. And the room at the rear becomes absolutely useless. If you say it can’t be helped because the boys are too many, I would say that we should take only as many boys as we can accommodate. We should not take more.
 Pandey’s mother Kodamba was in very dirty  clothes.  She looked like a maid servant. She did not even know Hindustani. And she has been with us for two months. Even Pandey’s own clothes were not quite all right. The neck was open and so also the cuffs. We are labourers. Our shirts must have half sleeves. Brass or glass buttons are useless for us.
 I had a brief discussion with Asha Devilibtech_742_footnote. But I am writing in detail because these matters, though small, are very important. And failing in these points, we depart too far from our objective.
I have read this again. It seems to be all right.

 Referring to garba dance which the girls executed, Gandhiji said:
 No doubt garba dance is famous in the world but this is no time for such dance.

715,,RATIONAL APPROACH TO NON-VIOLENCE libtech_745_footnote,"
    
 According to me what the All-India Congress Committee meant is clear. If constructive work is not carried on keeping non-violence in mind and accepting it rationally, India will not achieve swaraj as a result of it. A lot of work always went on in our villages but it was not informed by the knowledge and the vision of non- violence. So all we achieved was that we did not become as bankrupt financially as we are today. And when foreign invasion started, we abandoned the village industries one after another. Work for eradication of untouchability, uplift of Adivasis, equal rights for women, imparting training and bridging the gulf between the poor and the rich and so on had never been taken up. When we realized that to achieve real freedom the only royal way was that of non-violence and truth, our range of vision extended to the whole of India and beyond it to the whole world, and despite India being a slave country its fame spread in the world. I am firmly of opinion that if, as stated in the question, we forget all other aspects of non-violence except non-killing of human beings, non- violence will not remain non-violence, it will become bereft of truth, its universality will be lost and we shall never achieve swaraj. If ahimsa includes destruction of others’ property, boycotting Government servants, going underground and so on, then, we can neither awaken the crores of people nor give them the correct training in fearlessness. If we want to work non-violently, then it is necessary to accept the restrictions laid down by me. But if we do away with these restrictions then there will be no other alternative for us but to abandon non- violence and to train the people for violence. That this way is totally futile for us has been proved by this barbarous war. At any rate by openly accepting the way of violence we save ourselves from deceiving our own people and the world at large.

Khadi Jagat, November 1945
 
 
 "
716,,SPEECH ON NAYEE TALIM libtech_746_footnote,"
    
 November 1945
 Nayee Talim means teaching through craft. That basic craft has to be selected in the light of the conditions and produce of the region. For instance, it would not be proper to have khadi as a means of teaching in a region where cotton does not grow, but has to  be imported for the purpose.
 If Nayee Talim can be proved to be self-supporting through khadi, then the same thing can be applied to other industries too. What  I mean by making education self-sustaining is this. Just as the expense on food and clothing for the children studying  in  Government schools is borne by their parents, similarly, in Nayee Talim schools, parents will have to bear the expenses on food and clothing of their children. But the expenses incurred in the schools of today on books and fees will be saved.
 There should be no place for books in Nayee Talim. Initially some expenses may have to be incurred on cotton, carding-bow, and takli and so on. Afterwards the only expenses will be on the teachers’ salaries, stationery, and the salaries of peons, etc., if they have to be engaged.
 Suppose, there are thirty boys in one school. They will handle all the processes right from collecting cotton from the field  to  spinning and weaving the yarn into cloth. Through every process the teacher will educate them so that their intellect sharpens day by day. This will result in students’ making ever new discoveries in the methods employed in the khadi industry which will make it more productive and profitable.
 The cloth produced by students will be purchased by their parents at any price. It will be the teacher’s duty to see that through his students he creates an awareness in their parents that they may not even touch foreign and mill-made cloth. We should also see that an atmosphere of self-sufficiency in cloth and khadi is created. We shall have to create an atmosphere of our own. For bringing khadi to the stage it has reached today, we had to make efforts and create the climate. As a result no one now can root out khadi. The same thing can be said of Nayee Talim also. If the teacher is unable to create the necessary atmosphere, Nayee Talim cannot become self-reliant and cannot make headway. If he succeeds in creating the atmosphere and sharpening the intellect of the students, then the entire expenditure from beginning to end on Nayee Talim can be met from the sale of
 
 cloth produced by students.
 Students will be equipped for earning when they leave our schools. We do not promise them jobs. The Government also does not promise employment to students who are trained at enormous expense in Government schools. But our students will be brighter than the students of Government schools and will easily find occupations for themselves.
 We must remember that when atmosphere had to be created for Government schools, they had to put in considerable effort in spite of the way being clear. The atmosphere we have to create is for revival. That which has been destroyed has to be revived in a new way and we look upon it as a peaceful way of attaining swaraj. It should be easy to do this. We do not find it easy as we have not gone to the villages with the correct attitude and have made no real attempts at all. Now we have Nayee Talim. If it does not work a miracle and develop power, then what is it good for?
 We do not realize the full significance of boys and girls being entrusted to our care from their childhood and undergoing craft- based education in our schools for seven years or more. And the modern education which is being imparted to us teaches us that schooling can never become self-supporting. This creates some confusion in our minds. It is my firm belief that if Nayee Talim cannot become self-supporting, then the teachers do not understand what it is. In my view, amongst other characteristics self-reliance is the most important characteristic of Nayee Talim.
 If this is so for the education of boys and girls, then adult education must also be self-supporting. If we believe that it is difficult to convince adults about the value of education, then I have to say that this is nothing but an old illusion. And the teaching of the three R’s in adult education is no part of our Nayee Talim. The meaning of adult education is that we will give them, through their own language, all- round education of a pure and socially useful life. And if they do not easily become self-supporting, in my view there is some serious defect in that education. We should not also forget that complete co- operation should be the basis from the very beginning. Those who know the full meaning of co-operation will raise no doubts about self- reliance.
 QUESTION: Today only those students go to Government schools whose parents can pay for their food and clothing. We expect that under Nayee Talim, all the children of a village will go to school. There may be many among them who do not have the necessary food and clothing in their homes. What is the responsibility of Nayee Talim in such cases?
 A. I have just stated the ideal that parents will provide for food and clothes. Even now boys do eat and wear clothes. The parents will pay to school whatever they spend on their children’s food  and clothing. The diet we give will have a scientific basis. The expense will be a little more because of the milk. That expense will be met by the school. But when we persuade the parents to bear the expense on food, then they will pay for milk too. Those who are very poor will be very few; but if they are really poor then we can certainly bear the entire expense.
 I shall not worry about what clothes the girls and boys should wear because my ideal for them is a loin-cloth or clothes that a baby wears. It may be a brief kuchchha. We can easily make it. When girls develop breasts something will have to be done to cover them. The answer is a piece of cloth of the kind that is in vogue in the South. It is a different matter what provision is to be made in winters. You may not provide them any wraps but you must give them enough to wear. All this will be our property—the boys and girls of the same age group will wear them. One thing should be kept in mind, that these boys and girls will stay with us most of the time. We can easily bear all this expense. According to us the clothes for the poor and the rich will be the same. If the clothes are clean and of the right size, they will look as neat and tidy as naked children look.
 Q. (a) Will there be an increase in the demand for cloth if an atmosphere of self-reliance in cloth is generated?
 (b) Even if parents want to purchase cloth produced by their children, do they have the means to pay the price that we may ask for it?
 A. Any price must of course mean reasonable price. This merely means that those who do not even touch khadi today, will certainly buy the cloth made by their children if we sell it at a reasonable price. There will be no question of making a large profit on it. The price of every item will be different but by and large the difference between the cost price and the selling price will be almost the same. Even if the price of fancy goods is higher, still comparatively it will be much cheaper. Those who buy them will pay the price willingly. When self- reliance in cloth is achieved, everyone will accept khadi and will do so willingly. Then Nayee Talim will have reached its peak. Not one will even care for me if this happens during my lifetime.
All my answers apply to the present time, the present conditions.
 Q.  Training of teachers is a vast field that we have before us. In what way are   we to practise self-reliance in this training.
 A. Your question is, how can those who have come here to be teachers become self-reliant? If young students can become  self- reliant, the teachers must become self-reliant. The question is only one of bearing the expense of one’s own food, clothing and education. My point is that if teachers themselves cannot become self-reliant, how can they make the students self-reliant? In fact well-to-do persons who have come here not for salary but for service, will not need any supervision. They will learn all occupations attentively and carefully. They will not waste anything because of carelessness. Such people will be able to meet their entire expenses from whatever occupation they undertake. Your curriculum ought to be such that teachers  and students can earn enough for their expenses while they learn. You too will be put to the test in preparing such a curriculum. I like this question very much because it is a good sign that you have raised this question in the very beginning. Aryanayakum has written: “I have understood and agree with it.” This means that I also should have the same thing in mind that he has.
 If your syllabus is not based on the above lines, let me know. Perhaps I may be able to make it with your help. I go so far as to say that even wood should not be available free of charge. Bear in mind that we want to work in co-operation. We also want to learn true co- operation. Hence the fruits of everyone’s intelligence and skill should go into one pool. As I go on writing the subject becomes more and more interesting to me. I become more and more confirmed in my belief that self-reliance is the key to our success. This is proved by long experience.

 views 	will be there.  He 	declined to commit himself further.  When 	one of the newspapermen queried him about his travel from Wardha, 	Gandhiji, with his proverbial fund of wit, retorted jokingly:  	You have been travelling with me and if your  journalistic  instinct 	does not prompt you to answer that question, resign your post and 	take to something more useful in life. Amrita 	Bazar Patrika, 2-12-1945         SODEPUR,  December 1, 1945 He began 	by referring 	to his 	attempts made 	since 1914, when he was in England to learn Bengali. He made some progress in it, though he could not keep up  his Bengali studies. It was his ambition to be able to speak to the people of Bengal in  Bengali 	so that he might be able to penetrate into their hearts. He was 	sorry he could not do so on the present occasion. He was also of the 	opinion that no Indian could call himself a full-fledged citizen of 	India unless he could speak to the people of the various provinces 	in their own tongues. Failing this proficiency in the different 	languages it was the duty of every Indian to learn at least 	Hindustani which alone could be the rashtrabhashalibtech_753_footnoteof India.  He 	then proceeded 	to give 	the etiology 	of his 	present visit to 	Bengal. Ever 	since his 	release from prison, he 	had been anxious to 	visit Bengal but 	he could not 	do so owing 	to ill-health. 	Moreover, he did 	not want to visit 	Bengal unless he was 	sure that 	the authorities 	would welcome his visit 	and that 	there would be no 	restrictions on 	his movements. 	He was 	not prepared to 	submit to 	any restrictive 	orders on the 	one hand 	or on the 	other to 	offer civil disobedience 	against such orders 	under conditions now 	prevailing in 	the country. 	Even after 	the way for his visit 	to Bengal 	was clear 	it had to be postponed for several months on account of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who    
 was in need of nature cure treatment and needed his (Gandhiji’s) presence by his side. He was glad, however, that after all he had been able to come to Bengal.
 Explaining next the object of his visit, Gandhiji said that it was purely to offer whatever consolation his presence in their midst could give to the victims of Bengal famine and to do whatever he could to relieve their distress. He had not come to take part in the politics of the province or in the forthcoming elections. In fact, as they all knew, he took very little interest in these things. Where his chief interest lay was too well known to need reiteration.
 Mahatmaji then concluded after appealing to the people assembled  to contribute their mite to the Harijan Fund as a token of their sympathy with the cause of the abolition of untouchability as also to ameliorate the condition of Harijans. Incidentally he mentioned that in this way he had collected 2 lakhs of rupees for the Harijans since his release. The proceeds of the autograph fees that he charged were earmarked for the Harijan Fund. Anyone by paying a fee of Rs. 5 could have his autograph. There could be no exemption on the ground of poverty because according to him the autograph-hunting was essentially a rich-man’s hobby. Anyway, there was none poorer than the Harijans and consequently none had a right to cheat the Harijans out of the autograph fees which had been premortgaged to them.

722,"December 1, 1945",DISCUSSION WITH IAN STEPHENS libtech_754_footnote,"
    
 SODEPUR,
 [On or after December 1, 1945]libtech_755_footnote
 GANDHIJI: Arguing on those lines, you will be able to understand the prejudice in South Africa too. The root cause—a false notion of preservation of the race and economic status—is common to both. The difference is only one of degree. If you apply concrete facts to individual cases it is half a dozen of one and six of the other. It is on a par with the racial prejudice here.
 IAN STEPHENS: Oh, no. Here it is much less.
 G. Yes, owing to the vast disparity in numbers. But take the case  of the individual who actually suffers. His experience does not differ from that of the coloured men in South Africa or America.
 
 
 I. S. We, Englishmen are apt to forget that side of the question.
 G. Habit becomes second nature. There may be no deliberate intention either.
 I. S. In the Punjab and Delhi races mix much more freely than elsewhere. Was that due to the fact that the disparity in numbers was comparatively less there?
 Gandhiji was of opinion that the contrast presented by Bengal in this respect was perhaps due to the violent spirit having manifested itself there on a much larger scale than in Delhi or in the Punjab. The Punjab did show the violent spirit in some measure. But it was not a patch upon Bengal. The daring of the Chittagong Armoury Raid was neither attempted nor duplicated anywhere else.
 I. S. I have often thought over it, and it has always baffled me how these Bengali young men, so gentle by nature, have drifted into violence.
G. I have solved it for myself. They feel they have been
 unjustly libelled in the past. Lord Curzon harped on their softness. It soured them. So they say, ‘We may not be wealthy, but surely we are not effeminate.’ So they adopted this devious method and surpassed every other province in daring. They defied death, defied poverty and even public opinion. I have discussed this question of violence threadbare with so many terrorists and anarchists. It is terrible whether the Arab does it or the Jew. It is a bad outlook for the world if this spirit of violence takes hold of the mass mind.  Ultimately  in destroying itself it destroys the race.
 I. S. And it has spread all over the world for the last two or three years.
 G.  Look at the latest ukase of Gen. MacArthurlibtech_756_footnotelibtech_757_footnote. He has divided the entire Japanese nation into two categories, those whom he calls war criminals and those who do not come under that label. As I read it, it struck me that this was not the best way to introduce democracy among the Japanese—a race so proud, so sensitive, so  highly organized along Western lines. They will do what the Italians did in Garibaldi’s time on a much larger scale. You cannot deal with the human race on these lines. Whatever happens in one part of the world will affect the other parts. The world has so shrunk.
 This evoked from the friend the observation that he did not think that the world had deteriorated so much theoretically as it might have during the last three years. Gandhiji agreed with him though his grounds, he remarked, were different.
 I. S. My reason for that belief is that in spite of the fact that suffering, for
 
 instance in Indonesia and elsewhere, has been appalling during the last three years, the human mind has not been equally warped.
G. My hope is based on a detached view of the situation. Whilst
 in detention in the Aga Khan Palace I had leisure to read and think. What struck me was that whilst practice showed deterioration, the mind of man had very much progressed. Practice has not been able to keep pace with the mind. Man has begun to say, ‘This is wrong, that is wrong.’ Whereas previously he justified his conduct,  he  now  no longer justifies his own or his neighbour’s. He wants to set right the wrong but does not know that his own practice fails him. The contradiction between his thought and conduct fetters him.  His conduct is not governed by logic. Then, of course, there is my standing prediction in favour of non-violence that it will prevail— whatever man may or may not do. That keeps my optimism alive. Extensive personal experience too confirms my belief that non- violence is self-acting. It will have its way and overcome all obstacles irrespective of the shortcomings of the instruments. It makes no difference how we arrive at our conclusion, but it keeps us fresh and green.
 The conversation next turned upon Gandhiji’s pet theme of living up to 125 years. Gandhiji’s visitor wanted to know how he managed to keep physically fit. Gandhiji replied that outwardly he owed his physical fitness to strict adherence to regular habits in eating, drinking and sleeping and to his partiality for nature cure principles which he had adopted strictly in life since 1901. Reminiscently he described how up till 1901 he used the medicine bottle but had almost thrown it away and for forty-five years he had lived more or less according to nature cure principles.
 G. But, in a still greater measure, it is due to the practice of detachment of mind. By detachment I mean that you must not worry whether the desired result follows from your action or not, so long as your motive is pure, your means correct. Really, it means that things will come right in the end if you take care of the means and leave the rest to Him.
 He based his belief on the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita which he had called his “dictionary of action”.
 The friend remarked on the close analogy between the teaching of  the Bhagavad Gita and the thesis presented in Aldous Huxley’slibtech_758_footnoteEnds and Means. The mention of Aldous Huxley’s name revived in Gandhiji’s mind memories of old days
 
 about Aldous Huxley’s fatherlibtech_759_footnotewhose writings he used to read during his student days  in London in 1889.
 I. S. But there is a physical side all the same?
 G. Yes, only I attach greater importance to the mental. What you think you become. Thought is never complete unless it finds expression in action and action limits your thought. It is only when there is a perfect accord between the two that there is full, natural life.
 I. S. But what about the legacy of one’s past life? It cannot be written off the balance-sheet.
G. I have my answer for that. If my past conduct does not
 warrant the full span of life, no matter however correct my present life may be, I can still counteract the effect of past mistakes by attaining complete detachment between the mind and the body. Detachment enables one to overcome the effects of past faulty practice as well as handicaps of heredity and environment. Normally speaking, every deviation from the rule of nature, whether ignorant or wilful, e. g., anger, ill-temper, impatience, errors in conjugal life, exacts its toll. But there is this promise that if you have arrived at complete detachment you can rub out all these. “Except ye be born again, ye cannot have everlasting life.” Conversely, you can have everlasting life if you are “born again”. There is no hurdle placed before death. You can turn over a new leaf and begin life anew here and now; the past will not disturb its tenor provided you have completely severed yourself from it and its legacy by the axe of detachment.
 On the previous occasion when this friend had visited Gandhiji, Gandhiji had done all the talking and the friend had listened. This time Gandhiji had intended that he would only speak in answer to questions and let the friend do the talking but the friend again had the better of his resolve. Gandhiji remarked, discomfited, at the end of their talk:
I admit defeat. After all you are a practised journalist.
 I. S. I am only human.

  A. 	U. MEMBER: However much 	we may 	want to 	be friendly the 	past tradition 	clings round 	your necks and drives you 	to desperation. 	It seems 	to me, 	that there is hardly 	any hope 	of giving 	to a 	young Bengali 	student an idea 	of the 	better side of 	Englishmen unless perhaps 	he is transferred 	to England. 	The atmosphere 	in India 	is so 	poisoned that 	I wonder 	if it would 	not be 	better for 	Englishmen not 	to attempt 	to come to work in India just now but to wait for better times. 
GANDHIJI: Any friend, who is a real friend, and who comes in a
 spirit of service, not as a superior, is bound to be welcome. India, when she has come into her own will need all such assistance. The distrust of Englishmen, as you say, is there. It won’t disappear even by transporting Indian students to England. You have got to understand it and live it down. It has its roots in history. The late Charlie Andrews and I were bed-fellows. There were scarcely a thought in our mind which we did not share. He even adopted Indian dress though sometimes with grotesque results. But even he could not escape suspicion. He was even dubbed “a spy”. His was a very sensitive spirit. He suffered unspeakable anguish under these unmerited attacks and I was hard put to it to dispel the baseless distrust. ‘If he is a spy, I am a spy,’ I said to these critics. In the end C.  F.  A.’s  spirit triumphed.
 Pearsonlibtech_761_footnotewas C. F. Andrews’ disciple and friend. He too came in for his share of distrust. Then there is Stockslibtech_762_footnote. “If I am to serve India I must become an Indian,” he said to himself and married a Christian Rajput. He was boycotted by the Rajputs. The Government distrusted him too in the beginning. But he has lived down the distrust of both
 
 
 
 the Government and Indians.
 If then, even a C. F. Andrews and a Stokes and others had to labour under distrust, for you to be distrusted may not be wondered at. So far Indians have known Englishmen only as members of the ruling race—supercilious when they were not patronizing. The man in the street makes no distinction between such an Englishman and a good, humble European, between the Empire-builder Englishman of the old type that he has known and the new type that is now coming into being, burning to make reparation for what his forefathers did. Therefore, if one has not got the fire of sacrifice in him I would say to him: ‘Do not come to India just now.’ But if you are cast in a heroic mould there will be no difficulty. You will in the end be taken at your worth if you persevere. Anyway those of you who are here have no reason for going back.
 The same friend was able to elicit from Gandhiji what he considered to be the weak spots in the Indusco Plan of Chinese co-operatives. Firstly, the Indusco was a product of abnormal times. Its production was war-time and war-purposes production stimulated by the Japanese blockade. Secondly, it was organized by foreign missionary enterprise and their work was tainted by the proselytization motive.
 If you try to merely copy the Chinese co-operatives in India 
 you will end in miserable failure. Here you have to work among Indian Christians. The temperament is different, the character is different, and the circumstances are different. Co-operation which is rooted in the soil always works. You have therefore to find out for yourself what type of co-operative is best suited to the Indian temperament and soil. Even those who have become converts to orthodox Christianity are today veering round.
 M. By “veering round” you mean going back?
 G. Yes, I mean going back to real Christianity, to Christ, not Western Christianity. They are beginning to realize that Jesus was an Asiatic. Having seen this they are reading their Bible through Indian eyes. You should study the meaning of Indian Christianity through J.
 C. Kumarappa’s book Practice and Precepts of Jesus.

725,"December 2, 1945",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
    
 SODEPUR,
 December 2, 1945
 Addressing the congregation after the prayer Gandhiji said he would like to thank them and congratulate them because they had maintained silence and were peaceful during the prayer. The gathering of this evening was very big indeed. On Saturday the prayer meeting was less crowded. On both the days they had shown remarkable discipline. So he would thank them and hope they would continue to behave calmly in future also.
 The prayer song which was sung this evening had a special significance. Gandhiji said it was very appropriate in the conditions obtaining at present. The song was also sung in a very melodious tune.
 In the song there was an appeal to God to lead humanity from darkness to light. It said the humanity was engulfed in thickening darkness and had lost vision. So they were praying to God to give them strength and lead them to light.
 The import of the song was that they must be freed from all bondage and attain enlightenment. The freedom from bondage also included the winning of swaraj. India wanted release from the bondage.
 We are all engulfed in darkness today. Not only India but the world also is engulfed in darkness. India wants peace. So also does the entire world. We are all travellers groping in that thickening darkness. We are all blind and cannot feel the absence of light.
 The prayer we have offered is the most important thing of this evening. I was in South Africa when I used to pray privately. When I returned to India I saw the necessity of holding mass prayers. I have
 
 
 been holding mass prayers since then. There is of course the necessity of individual praying in his own way.
 Our prayer today to God is to lead us from darkness to light, from untruth to truth, and let us have peace—peace not only for India but for the entire world.
 Gandhiji said he did not like the shouting of slogans. The shouting of slogans disturbed the peaceful atmosphere which was the condition prerequisite to holding prayer. So he would request them not to distrub the peaceful atmosphere of the place by shouting slogans.
 In conclusion, Gandhiji asked the gathering to remove untouchability from their midst. Untouchability was a slur on humanity.
 Gandhiji then requested those who had assembled to contribute their mite to the Harijan Fund.

 I know your love for me. I also want to love you. I also want to win your heart. But that I want to achieve through work. Do not ask for my darshan or want to touch my feet. I am not God; I am a human being. I am an old man and my capacity to stand the strain is limited. If I am to appear before you again and again my strength will be exhausted. And I will not be able to do work.
 So my request to you is that you should not ask for my darshan or request me to stand before you so that you may touch my feet. If you come at prayer time you will have my darshan. But I want to impress upon you that I like peace. I do not like shouting of slogans or claps. They irritate me. If you love me you will not do so.

 SODEPUR,
      BHAI 	VALLABHRAM,  December 	4, 1945 
  	I have your letter. After I return to Sevagram and settle down there 	you may certainly come if you wish.  	May be you are not acquainted with my views as they have progressed. 	They were of course implicit in all my writings but of late they 	have become more explicit. I have no longer any interest in 	marriages, whether within the caste, inter-caste or even 	interprovincial. Therefore, so far as possible, I do not say 	anything anywhere on the subject of marriages. As it is I hardly 	ever attended any and now I have firmly stopped attending them 	altogether. What I believe is that if we want to preserve whatever 	is good in varnashrama every Hindu has to become not only a Shudra 	but an atishudralibtech_775_footnotelibtech_776_footnote, and regard himself as such. And as a true indication 	of it marriages should really take place only between atishudras and 	the so-called other varnas. These marriages also should be not for 	the sake of indulgence but so as to observe restraint and keeping in 	mind the restrictions it implies.  	Now I can send my blessings to Chi. Ramakant and Chi. Tara. May they 	be happy, live in restraint and may their alliance be doubly devoted 	to service. Often after a marriage instead of one sevak multiplying 	into two both the parties drop out of service. This is my 	experience. There are exceptions, and may this union be one such. To 	that end pure restraint on your part will prove helpful to them in 	every field.  	The Medical Board has not been lax; it has to do work that is vast 	in scope. Besides, they are contemplating a co-ordination of the 	various systems of medicine; so the matter it seems will take some 	time. Let me also add that although I have a great regard for    
 Ayurveda my experience with those practising it has not been very good. But, at the moment this is beside the point. We shall discuss this further when you can find time to come over.

  	It is thought, and it has been my experience, that through the power 	of prayer, heart-felt prayer, one can achieve what cannot be 	achieved by any other power. Swaraj is a very small thing. But 	prayer should not be recited mechanically. True prayer transforms 	the life of a man.  	Your second question displays sheer ignorance on your part. When did 	I say that I would live up to 125 years? If I can be so arrogant I 	shall be God as the questioner says. On the contrary I do not know 	whether I shall be able to take the next breath. What I have said is 	that I want to live for 125 years while rendering service. And I 	have also said that all should aspire to that end. We can only wish. 	I am an humble devotee of God.  From 	a copy of the Hindi: Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy: Pyarelal         SODEPUR,  December 	4, 1945  Gandhiji 	explained that the real purpose of the prayer could not be fulfilled 	unless the congregation became calm and quiet.  	I have just seen that a crowd of people have entered the prayer 	ground after we have finished the prayer. I must remind you all that 	the prayer begins punctually at 5 p. m. (Bengal Time). Those who 	want to join the prayer must reach the place earlier.  Proceeding, 	Gandhiji said that he was 	happy that such a 	big gathering attended 	his prayer. He was also 	happy that those who had unfortunately came late had imbibed the mass feeling and stood at the edge of the congregation and listened to what he had      
 to say very calmly and quietly. Even though they could not take part in the prayer they were very silent. That attitude, said Gandhiji, was what the prayer intended to teach the average man. It was called self-control and was a great factor of human life. For the last sixteen years he had practised it. Whenever he was late in attending any meeting or function he decided better not to go at all as otherwise he was sure to disturb others. When placed in such a position he requested friends to excuse his inability to comply with their requests for attending the meeting. He would strongly urge upon those who came to attend the prayer to learn the virtue of self-control and develop it in their lives.
 During his stay in Calcutta, concluded Gandhiji, he would try to explain the social and other important aspects of self-control and prayer.

 I have your letter. How will the marriage be performed at Gondia? Will there be some rites or will it take place before the magistrate? You have not made it clear. I, of course, wish you both well. I can never have any objection to such marriages if they are not for mindless indulgence but for exercising restraint, for expanding the field of service and enhancing the spirit of service. Actually, I can even encourage such marriages. That is why I wish to have a reply to the above question.

 SODEPUR,
 December 5, 1945
 
CHI. JIVANJI,
 I got your letter and the cheque. It has to be considered whether we should go as far as you suggest regarding the copy-  right. Anybody writing to us for permission and our giving it will mean that we have read the work or got it read by someone and approve. In this connection Anand Hingorani had suggested different Boards, so that the Tamil Board would decide about the Tamil translation and the Malayalam Board would advise about the translation in that language. There would, thus, be a separate Board for each language. We have to consider how far it would be advisable and becoming for us to bother ourselves to that extent.
 There are several translations of Tolstoy’s books in the same language. All of them are not up to the mark, and the titles of the books also have been translated differently. All of them sell, but the translation which is most faithful to the original, most painstaking and beautiful sells more than the other translations. The  same  has happened in the case of the Bible. The authorized version is there but there are many others in the field and their publication is not prohibited. Every translation has its own circle of readers.
 You have raised the question of the Autobiography. A translation has been brought out by one Tamil publisher and now this
 is the second. How would we know which of the two is really good? Or would it be advisable to stop other translations from being published? I do not see much benefit in that. Even when we decided to claim copyright, I did not go as far as that. This matter cannot be looked at from a purely legal point of view, nor from a  purely financial one. We should look at it wholly from a moral and practical point of view. And looking at it thus I feel that we should permit the person who has written to us to publish the translation. I have not replied to him, however. Consult all the others and discuss the matter with them and suggest whatever reply you think should be given. I will think over it and then send a reply to the man.

  With regard to Om Prakashji I think there is no need for an   	M. A. degree. Of course he must improve his knowledge of Urdu and 	achieve proficiency in it. But how will a degree help in that? If he 	wishes to go home when his brother sends for him, he can certainly 	go.   I 		had entrusted 		the sadhu 		to Aryanayakum’s 		charge because I 		felt I 		should not 		burden you 		with the responsibility 		of a 		case which needs careful [medical] 		attention. Let him go 		if he wishes to. 		If he 		stays he 		has to 		abide by 		all the rules. 		Cleaning of lavatories 		is the 		first duty. 		He should 		not be 		a burden in 		any way. 		From what Kanu tells me 		he seems 		to be a totally 		useless man.   	As for new Sevagram only what is deemed proper should be done. In 	this connection, only what Jajuji says should be done.  	Read the letter to Sankaran which is enclosed herewith. That 	includes my reply regarding his sister and his son.  	Any girl who wishes to learn only Hindi can easily learn it on her 	own. But we cannot provide facilities for teaching only Hindi. 	Provision can be made for both the scripts. This point is perfectly 	intelligible. Try to convince them by appealing to their reason. We 	may not compel anyone to learn both the scripts, but let us provide 	facilities for those who wish to learn both the scripts. "

SPEECH AT PRAYER
MEETINGlibtech_787_footnote","
      SODEPUR, 
  December 	6, 1945    In 	his introductory 	speech Gandhiji referred to 	the incident 	which took place  at 	Sodepur Railway Station 	when one person 	either in attempting  to 	board a running train which was not scheduled to stop at Sodepur or 	for some such reason was run over and killed.  They 	might think that when there were crores of Indians what did it 	matter if one met with death in such circumstances. But that was a 	totally wrong view. And if they allowed themselves to think in that 	way they would not be able to build up a brotherhood in India and 	secure her salvation. They must instead think that the person who 	met his death the other day was one of them and must feel sorry for 	his tragic end.  Perhaps, 	said Gandhiji, he himself was partly responsible for his death for 	the deceased went there either to see him or to attend the prayer. 	The congregation too was partly responsible because after the prayer 	was over they rushed to the Station, vied with each other to catch 	the train and thereby created a situation which caused this death. 	They, therefore, should henceforth take the vow with him not to 	create any such situation in future which might cause the death of a 	fellow-brother.  All 	this happened because they were not disciplined. The prayer was 	intended to confer upon man that discipline which he required so 	urgently. If they were mentally disciplined through the practice of 	prayer they would no more commit the mistake they committed the 	other day.  If 	by prayer they could be mentally disciplined, stated Gandhiji, they 	would     
 attain a state which was nobler and higher than even the salvation of India.
 Perhaps, freedom of India could be maintained with the help of pistols or swords. But were those weapons of any value if their votaries were not disciplined? Therefore whether a country was wedded to violence or non-violence discipline was of paramount importance to all men.
 Without discipline it was difficult to attain swaraj as he had stated two days
 ago.
 If they practised prayer with all concentration they would find that all their
 difficulties would smoothen.
 Concluding, Gandhiji referred to an incident in South Africa when a ship came upon a rock and was about to sink. Its Captain was a strong-willed and disciplined man. He preserved the calm of his mind and realized that he could not save all lives. He, therefore, secured the safety of as many men as he could and then went down with    a hymn to God on his lips alone with the sinking ship. If he was not a disciplined man, said Gandhiji, he could not have saved the lives of the many passengers of the ship whom he brought to safety. What was, therefore, urgently required of all was discipline and this all men could aquire by actively participating in prayer.

LORD WAVELL’S VERSION OF HIS TALK WITH GANDHIJIlibtech_788_footnote
 I deplored the recent speeches of Congress leaders and said that the preaching of violence could only lead to violence, especially with the inflammable material in India, of young students and goondas (the Indian equivalent of hooligans); and that fomentation of racial and communal hatred would not produce the atmosphere in which a solution could be produced in next year’s discussions. He admitted the violence of Congress speeches and indicated that he was trying to get the tone lowered. I said that an agreement of some kind between Hindu and Muslim was necessary, even if it was an agreement to part. He said he had always tried for a settlement but was frustrated by the British policy of divide and rule. I said this was nonsense, we tried our best to bring them together; that the increase in communal feeling was mainly due to the action of Congress Ministries in 1937-39 which had made Muslims feel they would not get a square deal from Congress and had caused the rise of the Muslim League and the idea of Pakistan. He defended the Congress Ministries at some length, and said all Governors had admitted their fairness. I said there was no doubt about the psychological effect on the Muslims, whatever the facts may have been; and he admitted this. I then said that the British were accustomed to abuse and misrepresentation from Indian Nationalists, but that there was a limit, and that it seemed hardly wise to antagonize us at this moment when we were trying our best to bring about a settlement, and that India after getting her freedom would want Britain’s co-operation in defence and in commercial development. I added that if any disorder resulted from the hatred now being stirred up, it would of course be my duty to suppress it, and I should do so by all means in my power. He assented to this; and then said that India needed no help from Britian in trade or defence. She would develop her trade in her own way, and her defence would be the moral force of non- violence, which would eventually conquer the world and bring about universal peace.   I said I did not think either of us would live to see this desirable issue, and that the immediate point was to prevent violence in India during the next year or so.  We left  it at that. He was quite friendly though woolly, and seemed in good health.
