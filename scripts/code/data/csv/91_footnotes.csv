During the meeting 	with the Cabinet 	Delegation on June 	8, the 	Viceroy said that “he 	had given no assurance 	to Mr. 	Jinnah” but 	he thought 	that “the 5 	: 5 : 2 ratio as 	the most hopeful basis of 	settlement” and 	that he 	was working 	on that 	basis. He told 	them that M. 	A. Jinnah “had 	taken a 	very strong 	line about 	the Interim 	Government and 	had said that the 	Muslim League would not 	be prepared 	to come 	in except 	on the 	basis of 	5 : 5 : 2 distribution 	of portfolios, 	between the Muslim 	League, the  Congress, 	and the minorities”. 	This parity between the 	Congress and 	the Muslim League 	was wholly 	unacceptable to the Congress."
