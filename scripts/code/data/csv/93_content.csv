       CHANDPUR,  November 	7, 1946  GANDHIJI: What goes 	against my grain is that a single individual can be converted or a 	single woman can be kidnapped or raped. So long as we feel we can be 	subjected to these indignities, we shall continue to be so 	subjected. If we say we cannot do without police or military 	protection, we really confess defeat even before the battle has 	begun. No police or military in the world can protect people who are 	cowards. Today you say thousands of people are terrorizing a mere 	handful, so what can the latter do? But even a few individuals are 	enough to terrorize the whole mass, if the latter feel helpless. 	Your trouble is not numerical inferiority but the feeling of 	helplessness that has seized you and the habit of depending on 	others. The remedy lies with you. That is why I am opposed to the 	idea of your evacuating East Bengal en masse . It is no cure 	for impotence or helplessness.  A 	WORKER: East Bengal is 	opposed to such a move.  G. They should not leave. 	20,000 able-bodied men prepared to die like brave men non-violently 	might today be regarded as a fairy tale, but it would be no fairy 	tale for every able-bodied man in a population of 20,000 to die like 	stalwart soldiers in open fight. They will go down in history like 	the immortal three hundred of Leonidas who made Thermopylae :  Stranger! 	Tell Sparta, here her sons are laid, Such was her law and we that 	law obeyed. I 	will proclaim from the housetops that it is the only condi- tion  	under which you can live in East Bengal. You have asked for Hindu 	officers, Hindu police and Hindu military in the place of Muslim. It 	is  a false cry. You forget that Hindu offi- cers, Hindu police and 	Hindu military have in the past done all these things—looting, 	arson, abduction, rape. I come from Kathiawar—the land of petty 	principa- lities. I  cannot describe to  you to  what depths of 	depravity human      
 nature can go. No woman’s honour is safe in some principalities and the chief is no hooligan but a duly annointed one.
 W. These are cases of individual depravity. Here we have got this on a mass
  scale.   G. 	But the individual there is not alone. He is backed by the 
 machinery 	of his little State.  W. 	 He is condemned even by 	his compeers. Here such acts are not condemned  by 	the Muslims. G. 	I have heard nothing but condemnation of these acts from  	Shaheed Suhrawardy downwards since I have come here. Words of 	condemnation may tickle your ears, but they are no consolation to 	the unfortunate women whose houses have been laid desolate or who 	have been abducted, forcibly converted and forcibly married.  	What a shame for Hindus, what a disgrace for Islam! No, I am not 	going to leave you in peace. Presently you will say to your- self, 	‘When will this man leave us and go?’ But this man will not go. 	He did not come on your invitation and he will go only on his own, 	but with your blessings, when his mission in East Bengal is 	fulfilled.  A 	WORKER: It is a part of 	their plan for Pakistan.  G. It is midsummer 	madness and they have realized it. They will soon sicken of it. They 	have already begun to.  W. 	Why do not they come here 	then and set this right?  G. That stage will come. 	Sickness only marks the crisis. Convalescence must precede cure. You 	see I am a nature-curist.  A 	WORKER: But here we are a 	mere drop in the ocean.  Gandhiji 	replied that even if 	there was one Hindu in 	East Bengal, 	he wanted 	him to 	have the courage 	to go and 	live in the 	midst of 	the Mussalmans 	and die if 	he must 	like a hero. 	He should 	refuse to live 	as a serf 	and a slave. 	He might 	not have 	the non-violent strength 	to die 	without fighting. But 	he could 	command their admiration  	if he had the courage not to submit to wrong and died fighting like a man.  	There is not a man, however cruel and hard-hearted, but would give 	his admiration to a brave man. A goonda is not the vile man 	he is imagined to be. He is not without his noble traits.  W. 	A goonda 	does not understand 	reason.  G. But he understands 	bravery. If he finds that you are braver than he, he will respect 	you. You will note that for the purposes of our present discussion I 	have not asked you to discard the use of arms. I 
 can’t provide you with arms. It is not for me to provide arms to the Chittagong Armoury  Raidlibtech_2_footnotemen.  The  most  tragic  thing  about  the Armoury Raid people is that they could not even multiply themselves. Their bravery was lop-sided. It did not infect others.
 A WORKER: No wonder it could not. They were condemned.
G. By whom? I may have—that is a different thing.
 W. The people did so. I am myself an Armoury Raid man.
 G. They did not. You are no  Armoury  Raid  man  or,  you should not have been here to tell these things. That so many of them should have remained living witnesses of the things  that  have happened is in my eyes a tragedy of the first order. If they had shown the same fearlessness and courage to face death in the present crisis as they did when they made that raid, they would have gone down in history as heroes. As it is, they have only inscribed a small footnote in the page of history. You will see I am not, as I have already said, asking you just now to unlearn the use of arms or to follow my type of heroism. I have not made it good even in my own case. I have come here to test it in East Bengal. I want you to take up the conventional type of heroism. You should be able to infect others— both men and women—with courage and fearlessness to face death when the alternative is dishonour and humiliation. Then the Hindus can stay in East Bengal, not otherwise. After all, the Mussalmans are blood of our blood and bone of our bone.
 W. Here the proportion of Mussalmans and Hindus is 6 to 1. How can you expect us to stand against such heavy odds?
 G. When India was brought under British subjection, there were 70,000 European soldiers against 33 crores of Indians.
 W. We have no arms. The Government backs them with its bayonets.
 G. The odds were much heavier against the Indians in South Africa. The Indian community there was a mere hand- ful in the midst of an overwhelming majority of Europeans and Negroes. The Europeans had arms. We had none. So we forged the weapon of satyagraha. Today the Indian is respected by the White man in South Africa, not so the Zulu with all his fine physique.
 A WORKER: So we are to fight with arms anyhow?
G. Not anyhow. Even violence has its code of ethics. For
 
 instance, to butcher helpless old men, women and children is not bravery but rank cowardice. Chivalry requires that they should be protected even at the cost of one’s life. The history of early Islam is replete with such instances of chivalry and Islam is all the stronger for them.
 W. Would you permit the Hindus to take the offensive?
 G. The people of Bihar did and brought disgrace upon thems- elves and India. They have set the clock of India’s independence back. I have a right to speak about Bihar. In a sense I feel closer to Bihar than to Bengal as fortune enabled me to give a striking demonstration of the non-violence technique in Champaran.libtech_3_footnoteI  have heard it said that the retaliation in Bihar has ‘cooled’ the Muslims down. They mean it has cowed them down for the time being. They forget that two can play at a game. Bihar has forged a link in the chain of our slavery. If the Bihar performance is repeated or if the Bihar mentality does not mend, you may note down my words in your diary: Before long India will pass under the yoke of the Big Three with one of them probably as the mandatory power. The Independence of India is today at stake in Bengal and Bihar. The British Government entrusted the Congress with power not because they are in love with the Congress but because they had faith that the Congress would use it wisely and well, not abuse it. Today Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru finds the ground slipping from under his feet. But he won’t let that happen. That is why he is in Bihar. He has said he is going to stay there as long as it may be necessary.
 Biharis have behaved as cowards. Use your arms well, if you must. Do not ill-use them. Bihar has not used its arms well. If the Biharis wanted to retaliate, they could have gone to Noakhali and died to a man. But for a thousand Hindus to fall upon a handful of Mussalmans—men, women and children —living in their midst is no retaliation but just brutality. It is the privilege of arms to protect the weak and helpless. The best succour that Bihar could have given to the Hindus of East Bengal would have been to guarantee with their own lives the absolute safety of the Muslim population  living  in  their midst.
 Their example would have told. And I have faith that they will still do so with due repentance when the present madness has passed away. Anyway that is the price I have put upon my life if they want me to live. Here ends the first lesson.

2,"November 7, 1946","DISCUSSION WITH MUSLIM
LEAGUE LEADERSlibtech_4_footnote","
  
 CHANDPUR,
 November 7, 1946 One of them remarked that no disturbances had taken place in Chandpur sub- division. The rush of refugees to Chandpur was due to panic caused by false Press
 propaganda. The number of Hindus killed by the Muslims was only 15 while double that number of Muslims had died as a result of firing by the military who were mostly Hindus.
 Another member of the deputation who was an M. L. A. was even more bitter about the fact that the Hindus were still evacuating and their rehabilitation was being ‘obstructed’ by the Hindu workers who encouraged them to migrate in order to discredit the Muslim League Government and paralyse the administration.
 Shamsuddin Saheb who was present at the meeting along with Nasrullah Saheblibtech_5_footnoteand Abdul Rashid Saheb interposed that it was no use isolating Chandpur sub- division and ignoring what had taken place elsewhere in the  district.  Equally irrelevant to their present argument was their reference to the military firing.
 When they had finished, Gandhiji replying remarked that if what they had said was to be taken at its face value, then it amounted to this: that the Muslims had committed no excesses. The mischief had all been provok ed by the excesses of the police and the military who were harassing the Mussalmans and it  was  they, therefore, who together with the panic-monger ing Hindus were the real culprits. That was too big a pill for anybody to swallow. Why had it become necessary to call the military, if no disturbances had taken place? A deputation of 20 to 25 Hindus had a meeting with him in the morning.libtech_6_footnoteThey had told him awful tales of what had happened in Tippera and Noakhali. Similar tales had been pouring into his ears ever since he had set foot in Bengal. Even Muslim Leaguers had admitted that terrible things had been done. They disputed the figures which they feared were exaggerated. He was not concerned with numbers. Even if there was a single case of abduction, forcible conversion or forcible marriage, it was enough to make every godfearing man or woman hang down his or her head in shame.
 He was not going to keep anything secret, Gandhiji proceeded. He would place all the information which he might receive before the Ministers. He had come to
 
 promote mutual goodwill and confidence. In that he wanted their help. He did not want peace to be established with the help of the police and the military. An imposed peace was no peace. He did not wish to encourage people to flee from their homes in East Bengal either. If the mass flight of the refugees had been deliberately planned to discredit the Muslim League Ministry, it would recoil on the heads of those who had done so. To him it seemed hardly credible. He suggested that the right course would be  to make a clean breast of the matter.
It is far better to magnify your own mistake and proclaim it to
 the whole world than leave it to the world to point the accusing finger at you. God never spares the evil-doer.
 The gentleman who had spoken first thereupon admitted that he had heard of some cases of arson and looting but the looting had taken place after the occupants had fled. The deserted houses offered too strong a temptation to the hooligans.
GANDHIJI: But why should people flee from their homes?  People
 do not do so normally. Everybody knows that an unoccupied and unprotected house is bound to be looted by someone or the other. Would anyone risk the loss of all he owns just to discredit the League?
 Still another member of the deputation remarked that only one per cent of the people had indulged in acts of hooliganism. The rest of the 99 per cent were really good people and in no way responsible for the happenings.
 That was not a correct way of looking at it, Gandhiji replied. If 99 per cent were good people and had actively disapproved of what had taken place, the one per cent would have been able to do nothing and could easily have been brought to book. Good people ought actively to combat the evil, to entitle them to that name. Sitting on the fence was no good. If they did not mean it, they should say so and openly tell all the Hindus in the Muslim majority areas to quit. But that was not their position as he understood it. The Qaid-e-Azam had said that the minorities in Pakistan would get unadulterated justice. Where was that justice? Today the Hindus asked him if Noakhali was an indication of what they were to expect in Pakistan. He had studied Islam. His Muslim friends in South Africa used to say to him: “Why not recite the Kalama and forget Hinduism?” He used to say in reply that he would gladly recite the Kalama but forget Hinduism never. His respect and regard for Hazrat Mohammed was not less than theirs. But authoritarianism and compulsion was the way to corrupt religion, not to advance it.
 Shamsuddin Saheb agreeing with Gandhiji quoted a verse from the Koran to the effect that there can be no compulsion in religion. He had told the Mussalmans, he said, that if they wanted Pakistan they must mete out justice to the minority community and win its confidence. “By doing what you have done, you have killed Pakistan,” he had told them.
 G. Mr. McInerny, the District Magistrate  of Noakhali,  in  a leaflet he has issued, has said that he will assume, unless the contrary is conclusively proved, that anyone who accepted Islam after the beginning of the recent disturbances was forcibly converted and in fact remained a Hindu. If all the Muslims made that declaration, it would go a long way to settle the question. Why should there be a public show of it, if anybody genuinely felt inclined to recite the Kalama? A heart conversion needs no other witness than God.
 Mere recitation of the Kalama while one continued to indulge in acts which are contrary to elementary decency was not Islam but a travesty of it. That reminded him of the Plymouth Brotherslibtech_7_footnotewho had invited him to embrace Christianity because then he would be free to do anything he liked since Christ redeemed the sins of those who accepted him. As against that there was the conclusive verse of the New Testament: “Not everyone who says Lord, Lord, with his lips comes to me.”libtech_8_footnotelibtech_9_footnoteIt was therefore up to the leaders of the Muslims to declare that forcible repetition of a formula could not make a non-Muslim into a Muslim. It only shamed Islam.
 “All that has happened is the result of false propaganda,” argued one member of the deputation who had not hitherto spoken.
 G. Let us not make a scapegoat of false propaganda. False propaganda would fall flat if we are all right.
 Finally one of the deputationists remarked that they were all prepared to go into the interior along with the Hindu leaders to restore peace and confidence but the latter distrusted them.
 Gandhiji replied that that did not matter. He would gladly accept their offer. He
  said 	:   You and I will visit 	every village and every home in the interior 
  	and restore peace and confidence.  Harijan, 	24-11-1946

 LAKSHAM,
 November 7, 1946
 I have not come on a whirlwind propaganda visit. I have come to stay here with you as one of you. I have no provincialism in me. I claim to be an Indian and therefore a Bengali even as I am a Gujarati.  I have vowed to myself that I will stay on here and die here if necessary, but I will not leave Bengal till the hatchet is finally buried and even a solitary Hindu girl is not afraid to move freely about in the midst of Mussalmans.
 The greatest help you can give me is to banish fear from your hearts. And what is the talisman that can do that for you. It is the unfailing mantra of Ramanama. You may say, you do not believe in Him. You do not know that but for His will you could not draw a single breath. Call Him Ishwar, Allah, God, Ahura Mazda. His names are as innumerable as there are men. He is one without a second. He alone is great. There is none greater than He. He is timeless, formless, stainless. Such is my Rama. He alone is my Lord and Master.
 Gandhiji touchingly described to them how as a little boy he used to be usually timid and afraid of even shadows and how his nurse Rambha had taught him the secret  of Ramanama as an antidote to fear. “When in fear, take Ramanama. He will protect you,” she used to tell him. Ever since then Ramanama had been his unfailing refuge and shelter from all kinds of fear.
 He resides in the heart of the pure always. Tulsidas, that prince of devotees, whose name had become a household word among the Hindus from Kashmir to Cape Comorin as Shri Chaitanya’s and Shri Ramakrishna Paramahansa’s in Bengal, had presented the message of that name to us in his immortal Ramayana. If you walked in fear of that name, you did not need to fear any man on earth, be he a prince or a pauper.
 Why should they be afraid of the cry of “Allaho Akbar”? The Allah of Islam was the protector of innocence. What had been done in East Bengal had not the sanction of Islam as preached by its Prophet.
 Who could dare to dishonour their wives or daughters if they had faith in God?
 
 He, therefore, expected them to cease to be afraid of Mussalmans. If they believed in Ramanama, they must not think of leaving East Bengal. They must live where they were born and brought up and die there if necessary, defending their honour as brave men and women.
To run away from danger instead of facing it is to deny one’s
 faith in man and God and even one’s own self. It were better for one to drown oneself than live to declare such bankruptcy of faith.
 If you ask the military, they will tell you that God is their protector. I want you, therefore, to be able to tell Shamsuddin Saheb that you no longer need the protection of the police and the military, which may be withdrawn, but would rather put yourself under the protection of Him whose protection they all seek.libtech_11_footnote
 Gandhiji said that the military and the police could not give any protection. They could ask the soldiers (who were then standing with them) whether anybody could save them in war. Guns were unavailing before death. It was only God who could protect. The only way to save oneself was to rely on one’s fellowmen, no matter whether they were Hindus or Muslims. It was the gospel of love that he had come here   to preach.
 The Bengal Ministers and other officials were accompanying him, he added, but not to look after him. They would help him preach and convince the people to have faith in their fellowmen and neighbours and remove fear from their minds. Gandhiji felt convinced that the people would soon learn to dispense with the military and the police. The sooner they could do so, he said, the better. He would like   to hear people say so from today.

MEETINGlibtech_12_footnote","
        CHAUMUHANI, 
  November 	7, 1946  Gandhiji 	told them how he 	had toured 	East Bengal 	in the 	company of 	the Ali 	Brothers during the 	Khilafat days. In 	those days the 	Muslims felt that all 	that he 	said was 	right. If 	the Ali Brothers went 	into a women’s 	meeting, they went blindfolded. He 	was allowed to go with his eyes open. Why should he blindfold himself when he went     
 to his mothers and sisters? He had no desire to go among the purdah ladies. But the Ali Brothers insisted that he must go. The women were eager to meet him and they were sure that his advice would do good to them. In South Africa he had lived in the midst of Muslim friends for twenty years. They treated him as a member of their family and told their wives and sisters that they need not observe purdah with him. He had become a barrister in England but what was a dinner barrister worth? It was South Africa and the struggle that he had launched there that had made him. It was there that he discovered satyagraha and civil disobedience.
 He had come to them in sadness. What sin had Mother India committed that her children, Hindus and Muslims, were quarrelling with each other? He had learnt that no Hindu woman was safe today in some parts of East Bengal. Ever since he had come to Bengal, he was hearing awful tales of Muslim atrocities. Shaheed Saheb, their Prime Minister, and Shamsuddin Saheb had admitted that there was some truth in the reports that one heard.
 I have not come to excite the Hindus to fight the Mussalmans. I have no enemies. I have fought the British all my life. Yet they are my friends. I have never wished them ill.
 He had heard of forcible conversions, forcible feeding of beef, abductions and forcible marriages, not to talk about murders, arson and loot. They had broken idols. The Muslims did not worship them nor did he. But why should they interfere with those who wished to worship them? These incidents are a blot on the name of Islam. He said :
 I have studied the Koran. The very word Islam means peace. The Muslim greeting ‘Salam Alaikum’ is the same for all, whether Hindus or Muslims or any other. Nowhere does Islam allow such things as had happened in Noakhali and Tippera. Shaheed Saheb and all the Ministers and League leaders who met me in Calcutta have condemned such acts unequivocally. The Muslims are in such overwhelming majority in East Bengal that I expect them to constitute themselves the guardians of the small Hindu minority. They should tell Hindu women that while they are there, no one dare cast an evil eye on them.libtech_13_footnote

 CHAUMUHANI,
 [On or after November 7, 1946]
 GANDHIJI: The tragedy is not that so many Muslims have gone mad, but that so many Hindus in East Bengal have been witnesses to these things. If every Hindu in East Bengal had been done to death, I would not have minded it. Do you know what the Rajputs did? They killed their womenfolk when they issued forth to sacrifice themselves on the battlefield. The surviving ones immolated them- selves by mounting the funeral pyre before the fortress fell rather than allow themselves to be captured and dishonoured. There is nothing coura- geous in thousands of Mussalmans killing out a handful of Hindus in their midst, but that the Hindus should have degraded themselves by such cowardice, i.e., being witness to abduction and rape, forcible conversion and forcible marriage of their womenfolk, is  heart- rending.
 QUESTION: How can we create a sense of security and self-confidence?
 By learning to die bravely. Let us turn our wrath against ourselves. I am not interested in getting the police substituted by the military or the Muslim police by the Hindu police. They are broken reeds.
 To whom should we appeal—the Congress, the League or the British Government?
 To none of these. Appeal to yourselves, therefore to God.
 We are men—made of flesh and blood. We need some material support.
Then appeal to your own flesh and blood. Purify it of all dross.
 A WOMAN WORKER: What is your idea of rehabilitation?
 GANDHIJI: Not to send them to Assam and West Bengal but to infuse courage in them so that they are not afraid to stay in their original homes.
 How is that possible?
 You must stay in their midst and say to them: ‘We shall die to the last person before a hair of your head is injured.’ Then you will produce heroines in East Bengal.
 That was once our idea too.
 I do not mind if each and every one of the 500 families in your area is done to death. Here you are 20 per cent of the population. In Bihar, the Muslims constitute only 14 per cent.
 They know they won’t be molested there.
 They have been butchered in a more unsufferable manner and there have been cases of molestation of women too, this time.
 If the Government do not provide rations?
 There are so many relief organizations. Rations can  be purchased but honour and self-respect cannot be bought. I have a feeling that even the Bengal Government do not want
 this thing to go any further. The lesson has been taught not by Bihar but the vile things done in Bengal. They stand aghast.
 You have opened up a new vista before us, Mahatmaji. We feel fresh blood coursing through our veins.

 Gandhiji told them that it was a shame for both the Hindus and the Mussalmans that the Hindus should have to run away from their homes as they had done. It was a shame for the Muslims because it was out of fear of the Muslims that the Hindus had run away. Why should a human being inspire another with fear? It was no less a shame for the Hindus to have given way to craven fear. He had always said that man should fear none but God. The Government officials accompanying him were all anxious that they should return to their homes. To feed and clothe thousands in one place involved difficulties for the refugees as well as for the Government. The Government officials were ashamed of the fact that such things should have happened in their jurisdiction. He wanted them to forgive and forget what had happened in Noakhali and Tippera. That did not mean that they were to become cowards. But it served no useful purpose to keep on recalling the unpleasant past. He hoped and prayed that the Hindus and Muslims of these parts would become friends once more. He knew the Hindus had suffered a lot and were suffering still. He would not ask them to return to their homes till at least one good Muslim and one good Hindu came forward to accompany them and stand surety for their safety in each village. He was sure there were plenty of good Hindus and good Muslims in these parts who would give the necessary guarantee.
 A Muslim friend from the audience said, they had already given them the assurance that they would look after them but the Hindus would not listen to them. Gandhiji replied that they should try to understand and appreciate the reasons of the Hindus’ distrust and overcome their fear. A Hindu refugee got up and askedlibtech_18_footnotehow they could have confidence in the assurances of the Muslims any more. When the trouble was threatening they had promised to look after them but had failed to protect them afterwards. Besides, where were they to go and stay? They had lost their all. Were they  to go back and stay in the jungles? And when fifty good Muslims in the village had failed to save them on the previous occasion, how would one good Muslim do so now? Moreover, miscreants were still at large roaming about in villages even after one month of the incidents.libtech_19_footnotelibtech_20_footnoteGandhiji replied that the Government would see that
 
 their huts were rebuilt and they had food and clothing when they returned to their homes. Whatever might have happened in the past, if now one good Muslim and one good Hindu took the responsibility for their safety in each village, they could rely on their word backed as it would be by the collective invitation of all the Muslims in the village. If they were still afraid they were cowards and not even God could help the cowardly.

 CHAUMUHANI,
 November 8, 1946 One of the friends suggested that in order to restore confidence Hindu leaders  should reinforce the appeals of  the Muslims to  the refugees to  go  back   to their
 villages. Gandhiji replied that that was not the right way to dispel the apprehension
 and distrust of the Hindus which was well grounded. He would not be able to advise them to return to their homes unless there was at least one good Hindu and one good Mussalman for each village who would stand guarantee for their safety and security and who would be prepared to immolate himself before a hair of their head was touched. It was for the Muslim League leaders who were also members of the Government to say whether such men would be forthcoming. There was no other way to restore confidence after all that had happened. They all agreed with Gandhiji’s suggestion and said that they would do their best to give effect to it.

 CHAUMUHANI,
 November 9, 1946
 Two telegrams from Patna reprove me on my “threatened” fast. “Threatened” is the word used in one of the wires. My proposed fast is not meant to coerce anyone; it is meant to quicken the dead conscience into life. Those who act from fear harm themselves and the cause they profess to serve. Surely, it is as plain as A. B. C. that the action of the Biharis in injuring the very small minority of Muslims in Bihar must postpone the day of India’s independence and ultimately sour Muslims all over India unless Bihar repents her folly of senseless and cowardly violence.
 Rashtrapati Acharya Kripalani, whom every Bihari knows for his sterling services, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr. Rajendra Prasad and now Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Shri Jayaprakash Narayan are now in Bihar and expect to show fair Bihar that their terrible ill- treatment of the Muslims is communalism of the worst type and is calculated to defeat the growing nationalism of Bihar. I, therefore, warn everyone from abusing my contemplated fast which is in no way intended to deflect anyone from what he believes is the course of duty for him.

  	The work here is more difficult than I had imagined. And the 	Qaid-e-Azam’s statementlibtech_26_footnotegiven to the   representative  of  the  Globe which 	I saw in the Morning News of November 10, has rendered it 	even more difficult. In the beginning it uses the expression ‘caste 	Hindu’, later followed by the word ‘Hindu’. Is co-operation 	between Hindus and Muslims an utter impossibility? If it is so, what 	will be the plight of Bengal and Hindustan? What will happen to 	Noakhali and    
 Tippera?
 The refugees here do not get even half their rations and the rice they get is unfit for consumption. They have nothing to cover themselves with during winter. Their houses are damaged, the sanitation is unsatisfactory. Satis Babu has prepared a report which I am sending you.
 The officials here are fully co-operating with me for which I am grateful to you as well as to them. But is it not our task to settle the differences and turn both the communities into mutual friends?

 DATTAPARA,
 November 10, 1946 Whether you believe me or not, I want to assure you that I am a servant of both the Hindus and the Mussalmans. I have not come here
to   fight  Pakistan.  If   India  is  destined  to   be   partitioned,   I cannot
 prevent it. But I wish to tell you that Pakistan cannot be established by force. In the bhajan that was just sung ‘the poet has likened God to the philosophers’ stone. The proverbial philosophers’ stone is said to turn iron into gold. That is not always desirable. For instance, if all the rails of the railway track were turned into gold by the touch of the stone, the trains would not be able to run over them. But the touch of God purifies the soul. That is always desirable.
 That philosophers’ stone is within us all. All that I wish to tell my Muslim brethren is that, whether they live as one people or two, they should live as friends with the Hindus. If they do not wish to do so, they should say so plainly. I would in that case confess myself defeated. The refugees cannot stay on as refugees for ever. The Government cannot go on feeding them. And what sort of feed are they getting? Less than half the daily ration of cereals to keep an able- bodied man alive, no fish, no vegetables, nor anything else to
 
 supplement it. It is not possible for them to exist like this for any length of time. If, therefore, the Muslims do not want them back in their villages, they must go elsewhere.
 But even if every Hindu of East Bengal went away, I will still continue to live amidst the Muslims of East Bengal and eat what they give me and what I consider lawful for me to partake of. I will not bring my food from outside. I do not need fish or flesh. All that I need is a little fruit, vegetables and some goat’s milk. As far as goat’s milk and cereals are concerned, I would take them again only when it pleases God that I should do so. I have given it up and would not resume it till the Hindus are really penitent of what they have done in Bihar.
 For a thousand Hindus to surround a hundred Mussalmans or for a thousand Mussalmans to surround a hundred Hindus and  oppress them is not bravery but cowardice. Fair fight means even numbers and previous notice. That does not mean that I approve of their fighting. It has been said that the Hindus and Mussalmans cannot stay together as friends or co-operate with each other. No one can make me believe that, but if that is your belief, you should say so. I would in that case not ask the Hindus to return to their homes. They would leave East Bengal, and it would be a shame for both the Mussalmans and the Hindus. If, on the other hand, you want the Hindus to stay in your midst, you should tell them that they need not look to the military for protection but to their  Muslim  brethren instead. Their daughters and sisters and mothers are your own daughters, sisters and mothers and you should protect them with your lives. I addressed them in the refugee camp yesterday. The District Magistrate, Mr. McInerny, told them that all mankind being descended from Adam and Eve, they were all members of one family—relatives, whatever their race or religion. So they should live together as relatives.
 One man is said to have returned to his village last evening after the prayer meeting. He found his house surrounded by Muslims.  They would not let him take his property. How can I, under these circumstances (if they are true), ask anyone to go back? You should ponder over what I have said and let me know what you really wish. I shall advise the Hindus accordingly.
I am told and I believe that there are many good Muslims who
 would welcome the Hindus back but the goondas stand in the way. I wish to tell you that if the good Muslims spoke out with one voice and acted according to their professions, the so-called goondas would become ineffective and would mend their ways.

  November 	12, 1946  Gandhiji 	again referred to the 	question of 	repatriation. The 	Moulvi Saheb, the 	Vice-President of Union 	No. 6, 	who had addressed 	them before him had 	invited them 	in the 	name of 	the Mussalmans 	to return 	to their 	homes. But it 	was not so 	easy in 	action as it was in speech. Everyone was anxious to see the two communities live in     
 peace and harmony once again. For that it was not necessary that they should have the same religion. He had seen awful sights of destruction. He had seen the terror- stricken faces of the sufferers. They had been forcibly converted once and they were afraid the same thing would be repeated. He wanted them to shed that fear. He alone deserved to live who refused to give up God’s name.libtech_38_footnoteHe remembered how during the Jallianwala Bagh days, young English lads made big, hefty men crawl on their bellies. The lane through which they were made to crawl was called the crawling lane. Those men had a human form but they were worse than worms. So they must learn to be brave and face death rather than give up Ramanama.
 He was not enamoured of the military and the police. The function of the police was to arrest thieves and dacoits, that of the military to guard them against foreign aggression. The police and the military could not teach them to cease fighting among themselves and live as friends. He would not ask anyone to return to their homes unless one good Hindu and one good Muslim stood surety for their safety in their respective villages.libtech_39_footnoteHe referred to the scheme for repatriation but it could work only if the Muslim League wished to have peace and fully co-operated. Shamsuddin Saheb was coming in two or three days. They would hear from him what the League Government wanted to do.

 DATTAPARA,libtech_41_footnote
 November 13, 1946
 Early in the morning Gandhiji announced to his party an important decision. He had decided to disperse his party detailing each member, including the ladies, to settle down in one affected village and make himself or herself hostage for the safety and security of the Hindu minority of that village. They must be pledged to protect
 
 with their lives, if necessary, the Hindu population of that village. His decision was not binding on anyone of his party, he said. Those who wanted to, were free to go away and take up any of his other constructive activities.
 Those who have ill-will against the Mussalmans or Islam in their hearts or cannot curb their indignation at what has happened should stay away. They will only misrepresent me by working under this plan.
 So far as he was concerned, he added, his decision was final and irrevocable and left no room for discussion. He was going to bury himself in East Bengal till the Hindus and Mussalmans learnt to live together in harmony and peace. He would deprive himself of the services of all his companions and fend for himself with whatever assistance he could command locally.libtech_42_footnoteHis ahimsa would be incomplete, he argued, unless he took that step. Either ahimsa is the law of life or it is not. A friend used to say that the Ahimsa Sutra in Patanjali—Ahimsa Pratishthayam Tatsannidhau vairatyagah          was a mistake and needed to be amended and the saying Ahimsa Paramodharmah	  ought to be read as  Himsa Paramodharmah         ; in other words, violence, not non- violence was the supreme law. If at the crucial moment he lost faith in the law of non-violence, he must accept the deceased friend’s amendment which appeared to him   to be absurd. Gandhiji continued :
I know the women of Bengal better than probably the Bengalis
 do. Today they feel crushed and helpless. The sacrifice of myself and my companions would at least teach them the art of dying with self- respect. It might open, too, the eyes of the oppressors and melt their hearts. I do not say that the moment my eyes are closed theirs will open. But that will be the ultimate result, I have not the slightest doubt.  If ahimsa disappears, Hindu Dharma disappears.
 “The issue is not religious but political. It is not a movement against the Hindus, but against the Congress,” remarked one member of the party.
GANDHIJI: Do you not see that they think that the Congress is a
 purely Hindu body? And do not forget that I have no watertight compartments such as religious, political and other. Let us not lose ourselves in a forest of words. How to solve the tangle—violently or non-violently—is the question. In other words, has my method efficacy today?
 
 
 QUESTION: How can you reason with people who are thirsting for your blood?
 Only the other day one of our workers was murdered.
GANDHIJI: I know it. To quell the rage is our job.
 Another worker asked whether it was right to invite people to return to their villages under the prevailing conditions which involved a considerable amount of risk.
 Gandhiji’s reply was that there was no harm in asking them to return to their villages if the Muslims of that village collectively guaranteed their safety and their guarantee was backed by one good Hindu and one good Mussalman, who would stay with them in that village and protect them by laying down their lives, if necessary. If there was that much guarantee, the refugees ought to return to their homes and face whatever risk there might be. If they had not the courage to live on these terms, Hinduism was doomed to disappear from East Bengal. The question of East Bengal is  not one of Bengal alone. The battle for India is today being decided in East Bengal. Today Mussalmans are being taught by some that Hindu religion is an abomination and therefore forcible conversion of Hindus to Islam is a merit. It would save to Islam at least the descendants of those who were  forcibly converted.  If retaliation is  to rule the day, the Hindus, in order to win, will have to outstrip the Mussalmans in the nefarious deeds that the latter are reported to have done. The United Nations set out to fight Hitler with his weapons and ended by out-Hitlering Hitler.
 QUESTION: How can we reassure the people when the miscreants are still at large in these villages?
G. That is why I have insisted upon one good Mussalman
 standing surety along with a good Hindu for the safety and security of those who might be returning. The former will have to be provided by the Muslim Leaguers who form the Bengal Government.

 DATTAPARA,

 It was represented by the Maulvi Saheb who had spoken the previous day in the prayer meeting that the Muslims, far from wanting to drive away the Hindus, themselves felt insecure as a number of them with status and standing had been put under arrest although they were innocent and that was the real obstacle in the way of
 
 their befriending the Hindus.  Gandhiji replied that he did not see how that could stand   in the way of their establishing good relations with the Hindus. On the contrary, it ought to provide an incentive for cultivating their friendship and winning their confidence so that there would be no motive left to get innocent Muslims implicated. The issue was really irrelevant to the proposition before them.
When large numbers have participated in crime, it is but natural
 that some innocent men will be implicated with the guilty ones. It is so all the world over. That does not mean that the guilty ones should not be proceeded against.
 The remedy was for the Muslims to confer with the Hindus and produce agreed lists of those who had been really guilty. No innocent person would then suffer. To bring to book the really guilty ones was the acid test of the sincerity of the authorities and the local Muslims alike. Addressing the members of the Muslim League in the gathering, Gandhiji proceeded:
I have come here to seek your co-operation. You are a pow-
 erful party. What has happened here does not show Islam at its best or even at its worst. It is the very negation of Islam. The first question we have got to settle is whether there can be co-operation between the Hindus and Muslims. I have apprised Shaheed Shurawardy of the things that have prevented the refugees from returning to  their  villages. The havoc which I saw yesterday was appalling. These things cannot be whitewashed. Energetic steps have to be taken.

 Both the major parties are demoralized each in its own way. So is the third party—the British rulers. They cannot think cogently. Military glory and love of power will not allow them to do so. We see others as we are. Hence the central teaching of the Gita:  acquisition of the capacity to see things with detachment as perfect as it is humanly possible.
 In my opinion for the British not to leave India till there is perfect peace in the land seems to be an impossible dream. What they can and must do is to transfer the whole power to the willing and capable party at the earliest moment, to withdraw the British part of the army and disband the rest. They should not think of keeping any part for the protection of British interests. These must be left to the goodwill of the people of India. This is the royal road to peaceful transfer and no other. This conviction has not yet gone home to the cabinet. I doubt not that you can work out all the corollaries to the above. If you flounder at any point, send me your questions through  a messenger.

 I have replied to your wire. I cannot call both of you to stay here. Here it is a matter of ‘do or die’. Do’ means making the  Muslims see light. Besides, those who are with me will each have to go and camp in a different village and, if necessary, lay down his life. How can you then fit in here? You are in service. How can Manu stay alone in a strange village? Nevertheless, if both of you are willing to stay in separate villages and sacrifice yourselves, I shall be ready to take you. But if your telegram is meant only to seek permission for the two of you to come and see me, by all means do come. There will no doubt be some risk in that too.  I cannot say where I shall be then.   I expect of course to be somewhere in East Bengal. I do not even know whether I shall be alive. Now do as you think fit.
I hope Manudi has recovered. If she keeps indifferent health,
 
 she will not feel comfortable here. The climate and water are not very good. Even the necessities may not be available, or available only with great difficulty. The roads are difficult.

         SHAHPUR, 
  November 	14, 1946 Gandhiji 	had been told that there would be a big gathering at Shahpur. But someone had spread the 	rumour that he would be accompanied by the Superintendent  of 	Police, the District Magistrate and an armed guard who would utilize 	the occasion for making arrests, with the result that very few 	people were in evidence when Gandhiji arrived there.  	“It 	is a cruel joke,” remarked Gandhiji. For so far as he was 	concerned, he had never wanted any police or district authorities to 	accompany him. But the authorities said they could not take the risk 	of letting him go about unprotected.  It 	had been brought to his notice that in several places, while the 	local Mussalmans professed to be anxious that peace should be 	re-established, they were not prepared to do anything for it or give 	any guarantee unless the Muslim League leaders asked them to. 	Gandhiji, recognizing the reasonableness of their suggestion, 	referred to a statement of Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah which he had read that 	morning. He did not like everything in that statement but there were 	some things in it which should commend themselves to all. In that 	statement Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah had said:  	“If 	the Mussalmans lose their balance and give vent to the spirit of 	vengeance and retaliation and prove false to the highest codes of 	morality and preachings of our great religion Islam, they will not 	only lose their title to the claim of Pakistan but also it will 	start of a most vicious circle of bloodshed and cruelty which will 	at once put off the day of our freedom and we shall only be helping 	to prolong the period of slavery and bondage.”  He 	had further said :  	“We 	must prove politically that we are brave, generous and trustworthy . 	. . that in the Pakistan areas the minorities will enjoy the fullest 	security of life, property and honour just as the Mussalmans 	themselves, nay, even greater.”  He 	would like 	them, remarked Gandhiji, 	to ponder 	over that statement, 	if, on 	examination, they found 	that his 	quotation was 	correct. Murder, 	loot, arson, 	abduction, forcible 	marriages and forcible 	conversions could not but 	prolong India’s 	slavery. If 	they kept on 	quarrelling among 	themselves, if 	they looked 	to the 	police and 	the military for 	protection, they 	would be inciting 	the third 	party to rule 	over them.

KAZIRKHIL,
  November 	14, 1946  Gandhiji 	said he found indescribable peace in the natural scenery around him 	but he found that peace missing on the faces of the men and women. 	And how could they have peace after all that they had been through? 	He found a number of guards standing there to protect him and his 	party. Against whom were they to protect him? He was not used to 	going about with a guard. He had toured in Bengal unprotected before 	this. He said: But 	today the authorities would not let me do so. It is a matter  	of sorrow and shame for me and more than me it should be a matter of 	shame for the Mussalmans of East Bengal.  Even 	the schools and temples had been destroyed, he proceeded. Shamsuddin 	Saheb, their Minister, did not like it. The happenings in East 	Bengal, he said, had hurt him deeply. The hearts of the people had 	to be purged of hatred. For that their help and co-operation was 	necessary.  This 	fratricide was more awful than anything in his experience.  He had 	carried  on a grim 	struggle for 20 years 	in South 	Africa and for the last 	30 years 	in India. 	But this mutual slaughter 	had nonplussed 	him. He did 	not know how 	he could 	induce the two 	communities to 	live in 	peace and 	harmony again. He 	had come to 	Bengal to 	find out 	a solution for 	the problem. Bengal was 	a big province. If 	the communal problem 	could be solved here, it 	would be solved elsewhere also. If he succeeded here, he would go 	away from Bengal 	with a 	new lease 	of life. 	If not, 	he wished 	God to 	remove him 	from this 	earth. He 	did not wish 	to leave Bengal 	empty-handed.  The  word  	“pessimism” was 	not to be found in 	his dictionary.  The 	Muslims butchered 	the Hindus 	and did worse 	things than butchery in 	Bengal and the Hindus 	butchered the Muslims in Bihar. When both acted wickedly it  was 	no use 	making comparisons or 	saying one 	was less wicked than 	the other, or 	who started the trouble. 	If they wished to take revenge they should learn the art from  him. 	He also 	took revenge, but it was 	of a different type. He had read a Gujarati poem  in his 	childhood which said: “If 	to him 	who gives you 	a glass 	of water, 	you give 	two, there 	is no merit 	in it. 	Real merit lies 	in doing 	good to 	him who does you evil.” 	Gandhiji concluded: That 	I consider noble revenge.    
 I read a story about one of the earlier Caliphs. A man attacked the Caliph with a sword. The Caliph wrested the sword from the assailant’s hands and was going to kill him when the assailant spat on his face. The Caliph thereupon let him go free because the indignity had filled him with personal anger. This produced a great impression upon the assailant and he embraced Islam. One who is forcibly converted to Islam ceases to be a man. To recite the Kalma through fear is meaningless.

         RAMGANJ, 
  November 	15, 1946  Gandhiji 	reiterated and emphasized his previous day’s appeal. He could talk 	to them of nothing but sorrow and suffering these days. Wherever he 	went he saw awful sights of destruction. There were no tears in his 	eyes. He who shed tears could not wipe those of others, but his 	heart did weep. He had come with the hope that he could have a frank 	talk with the Mussalmans and that they would repent of their 	misdeeds and request the Hindus not to leave their homes. If the 	repentance was genuine, the Hindus would recognize their sincerity 	and regain lost confidence. But he could see that the Hindus and the 	Muslims of East Bengal had been embittered against one another. He 	would not go into the reasons thereof. But the Muslim brethren would 	permit him to say that so far as he knew, in East Bengal they had 	been the aggressors. The Hindus were mortally afraid of them. At 	Chaumuhani Muslims came to his meeting in larger numbers than the 	Hindus did. But he did not know why they were avoiding him after the 	first meeting at Dattapara. It hurt him. He wanted the few 	Mussalmans who were present at the meeting to carry his message to 	the rest. A Muslim sister who had been going about meeting leading 	Muslims in these parts had said that the Muslims told her plainly 	that they wanted orders from the League leaders before they could 	promise to befriend the Hindus or attend Gandhiji’s meetings. The 	exodus of the Hindus was still continuing. If the Muslims assured 	them that they were neighbours, friends and brothers, sons of the 	same soil, breathing the same air and drinking the same water, that 	the Hindus had nothing to fear from them, the exodus would stop and 	even those who had left their homes would return. Even animals were 	friendly to those who befriended them. But man was made in the image 	of God. To justify his inheritance, man had to return good for evil. 	Whosoever was at fault, this truth applied to both the parties. The 	Muslims wanted orders from the League. He could understand it. There 	was a League Government in the province. But that did not mean that 	the Government should be inimical to those outside the League.  He 	reiterated what he saidlibtech_57_footnoteabout Qaid-e-Azam 	Jinnah’s message 	on the 	 previous day. They 	should search their hearts and 	ask themselves if 	they had 	lived up to that message. He concluded:  	So far as I know, Islam does not permit forcible conversion and 	atrocities on women. What good can a mere repetition of the Kalma 	 do to one whose heart does not accept Islam? You should ask 	your leaders, therefore, whether you are to be friends with the 	Hindus or     
 enemies and tell me. If you wish to be enemies, the Hindus should be asked to leave East Bengal. For myself, I have come to stay in East Bengal till there is reconciliation between the two.

        KAZIRKHIL, 
  November 	16, 1946  Gandhiji, 	addressing the meeting 	after Goffran Saheblibtech_64_footnote, began 	by referring 	to Shamsuddin 	Saheb’s speechlibtech_65_footnoteat 	Chaumuhani a 	few days 	ago. They had now heard 	Goffran Saheb. The 	Ministers wanted them 	to live 	together as 	friends. The 	police  and 	the military could not 	protect them. God 	alone could protect them. 	They had, 	therefore, to 	look to 	each other for 	their safety. Goffran 	Saheb had told 	them that the Government 	did not wish the Hindus to leave East Bengal. Awful things had no 	doubt happened but 	they should let 	bygones be 	bygones. They must turn a 	new leaf. When 	one had suffered 	as they 	had, one was liable 	to become 	filled with suspicion. But 	that had 	to be overcome.  A 	member from the 	audience had 	requested him 	to allow 	him five 	minutes to reply 	to Goffran 	Saheb’s speech which he 	said, required correction 	in several 	places. But 	Gandhiji replied that 	he was 	afraid he 	could not allow the 	meeting to 	be turned into 	a public 	debate. Whatever was said 	at the meeting 	was said 	in good 	faithlibtech_66_footnoteand 	to  do 	His work. 	But if 	the friend 	in question 	sent him a 	letter, not 	couched offensively, 	he would 	gladly forward it 	to Goffran Saheb. 	He rebuked 	the audience 	too for not 	observing pindrop 	silence while the Muslim 	Members of the audience were performing 	namaz. 	Culture and 	good breeding 	required that they should 	observe silence 	when others said their prayer. There should be mutual respect. All 	worshi-pped the same God, whatever their religion. He was glad to 	see the Congress and the League 	flags flying together in 	the prayer 	ground. Both had great 	significance. They should 	realize as 	Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah Saheb 	had said 	that if they 	kept on quarrelling 	among themselves 	the country 	would remain a slave 	country and Pakistan 	would vanish into thin air.  He 	was receiving threatening 	letters, said Gandhiji. Some Muslims feared that 	he had come 	to suppress 	them. He 	could assure them that he 	had never 	suppressed anyone in 	all his life. They asked 	him why he had not gone 	to Bihar. 	He had declared 	his resolve to 	fastlibtech_67_footnoteif Bihar 	did not stop 	the madness. 	He was 	in constant 	touch with Bihar. Pandit Jawaharlalji, Dr. Rajendra Prasad and others had assured him that his        
 presence there was not required. Bihar, he understood, was practically peaceful now. Tension was still there, but it was going. The Muslims were returning to their villages. The Government had taken the responsibility to build the houses of those who had been rendered homeless. He was also receiving many telegrams from Hindus asking why he did not fast against the Muslims for the happenings in Bengal. He could not do so today. If the Mussalmans realized that he was their friend, he would be entitled to fast against them also. If he was to leave East Bengal he would go only after peace ruled the breasts of the Hindus and the Muslims. He had no desire to live any longer otherwise.libtech_68_footnote
 He was in the midst of a Muslim population in Noakhali, he said. He did not like the idea of staying with Hindu friends. He would like to see if he could stay with a League Mussalman.
My requirements are very few. All I want is cleanliness, clean
 water, permissible food and the freedom to pray to God in my own way.
 The Muslim friends will have an opportunity to examine me at close quarters and find out whether I am an enemy or a friend.

       KAZIRKHIL, 
  November 	17, 1946  The 	District Magistrate had issued orders and advertized the fact, 	remarked Gandhiji, that forcible conversions, i.e., conversions out 	of fear, would not be recognized by law. He did not know if everyone 	of those who had been converted forcibly had been restored to 	Hinduism. It not, it should be done if they wanted to replace the 	present bitterness between the two communities by cordiality.  Some 	abducted girls were still missing. They should be returned without 	further delay. A 	dhobi had 	brought to 	him his boy of 	one year 	this afternoon. He 	had recovered 	the child 	after a month 	from a Muslim 	with police help. It was 	the duty of 	the Muslim 	brethren to put an end to 	such acts. They should 	make a frank 	confession of error 	in the 	past and 	promise to 	avoid it 	in future. He, 	who tried to 	hide his 	mistakes, could never rectify them. He himself was a votary of truth. Even when he     
 practised law, he told his clients to tell him the truth if they wanted him to take up their case. He would not plead for a false case. The result was that only true and bona-fide cases were brought to him. He had long ceased to practise law and had even been struck off the rolls of the Bar registerlibtech_70_footnotefor the offence of sedition. But he continued to follow the same principle.  His advice to the Hindus and the Muslims was  to get rid of all evil in themselves. Without that they would not be able to live in peace or have respect for one another.
 Gandhiji observed that he had heard that because he did not allow a gentleman to reply to Goffran Saheb’s remarks there and then at the meeting, the Hindus were annoyed and had boycotted the meeting.libtech_71_footnoteHe was unrepentant. He never said or did anything merely to please others. He had always taught that one should do one’s duty irrespective of the reaction it may have on others. A man who always did what he believed to be right never feared anyone.

Why can no one intimidate the fearless?  You will find        
 that God is always by the side of the fearless. Therefore, we should fear Him alone and seek His protection. All other fear will then disappear by itself. Till fearlessness is cultivated by the people there will never be any peace in these parts for the Hindus or for the Mussalmans.

       MADHUPUR, 
  November 19,1946  Gandhiji 	observed that a 	friendlibtech_88_footnotehad told 	him that 	the explanationlibtech_89_footnotewas a 	make-believe. If 	they had 	boycotted the 	meeting, he 	did no 	mind it. 	They owed him 	 no apology 	on that 	account. And 	if they 	had stayed 	away out of 	fear, certainly 	no apology 	was due to 	him. But 	it was 	a shame 	for them 	to be so afraid. 	Were the men 	also such cowards that 	they had stayed 	away out of 	fear? Were the 	Muslims going to 	eat them 	up? If 	they were such cowards, 	they were not 	worthy of 	living in 	this country. 	The sister 	who had gone 	to him 	in the 	morning to 	request him 	to hold 	a women’s 	meeting at Madhupur 	had put before 	him three 	questions. The first 	question was that in 	spite of 	all their 	efforts they were unable 	to rescue 	some of 	the abducted 	women. He had told her 	that she should write to him about it and he would forward the 	letter to 	Shaheed Suhrawardy. He 	could even write to 	the Prime 	Minister directly. It was 	a matter 	which brooked no delay. 	Secondly she said 	there were some women in 	the villages who wanted 	to come away but wanted a military escort.  He never could be   a 	party to 	that. He 	had told 	the Prime 	Minister that he for 	one was not enamoured of 	the police 	and the military 	and that 	he could 	withdraw it at any time. 	The Hindus 	and the Muslims 	should be free 	to break 	each other’s 	heads if they 	wanted to. 	He would 	put up with that. But 	if they continued to 	look to 	the police and 	the military for 	help, they would 	remain slaves for ever. 	Those who preferred 	security to freedom 	had no 	right to live. 	He wanted 	the women 	to become 	brave. To change 	one’s religion under 	threat of force 	was no 	conversion but 	rather cowardice. 	A cowardly 	man or 	woman was 	a dead 	weight on 	any religion. 	Out of 	fear they might 	become Muslims today, Christians tomorrow and pass into a third religion the day after.  That was not      
 worthy of human beings. It was up to the men workers to tell the women that they would be their escort and would protect them with their lives. If still the women were afraid to come away, there was no help for them. He had come to proclaim from the housetops that the women had to become brave  or  else die.  They should make use of the calamity that had befallen them to cast out the demon of fear. Lastly the sister  had asked as to how they could advise the refugees to go back to their homes. He would not ask them to go back under police or military protection. They had run away out of the fear of the Muslims. Therefore, it was the Muslims who had to come forward and reassure them that they would regard them as their own mothers, daughters and sisters and protect them with their lives. Everybody must be entitled to retain his or her own religion without interference. All worshipped the same God although under different names. “If I see my God in this tree and worship it, why should the Muslims object?”
 It was wrong for anyone to say that his God was superior to another’s. God was one and the same for all. Hence, his formula was that from every village one good Hindu and one good Muslim should stand surety for the peace of the village. Then and then alone would he ask the refugees to return. The Ministers had liked his suggestion.

  [November 	19, 1946]libtech_91_footnoteQUESTION: Will 	the new experiment, which you propose to inaugurate tomorrow, of going and 	living singly in affected villages, infuse courage into the hearts of refugees and 	succeed in persuading them to return to their villages? What is  the 	significance underlying this experiment?  GANDHIJI: This question 	would not arise if you knew that I was going to a village for my own 	sake, that is, to test my ahimsa. I am not going singly; there will 	be Nirmal Kumar Bose as my Bengali interpreter and my stenographer 	Parasuram from the South. If I have the requisite courage and 	capacity to undergo a comparatively hard life and to encourage inner 	ahimsa, I should expect to affect both Hindus and Muslims in the 	right manner.  	You should also know that all members of my original party will 	similarly distribute themselves, taking with them a local Bengali     
 worker. The choice of village will rest with Satis Chandra Das Gupta.
 Asked whether Bengal Government would not feel that his action was aimed at bringing ridicule on them, Gandhiji replied:
 I think not, only because I have not the remotest idea  of  bringing ridicule on them, assuming of course that Bengal Govern- ment have meant every word of what they have said. Indeed, I am in search of a League Muslim who will harbour me in his house as a member of his family.
 Q.	Are you not taking a serious liberty with your life at this stage by proposing to live in a village which is perhaps not free from goondas ?
 G. I recognize no one as a goonda—or all are goondas, some
 more, some less. I have the conviction that so long as God wants my service in the present body, He will keep it from all harm.

 [On or before November 20, 1946]libtech_93_footnoteWhen I was in detention in the Aga Khan Palace, I once sat  down to write a thesis on India as a protagonist of non-violence. But
 as I proceeded with my writing, I could not go on. I had to stop. There are two aspects of Hinduism. There is, on the one hand, the historical Hinduism with its untouchability, superstitious worship of stocks and stones, animal sacrifice and so on. On the other, we have the Hinduism of the Gita, the Upanishads and Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra which is the acme of ahimsa and oneness of all creation, pure worship of one immanent, formless imperishable God. Ahimsa which to me is the chief glory of Hinduism has been sought to be explained away by our people as being meant for sannyasis only. I do not share that view. I have held that it is the way of life and India has to show it to the world. Where do I stand? Do I represent this ahimsa in my person? If I do, then deceit and hatred that poison the atmosphere should dissolve. It is only by going into isolation from my compa- nions, those on whose help I have relied all along, and standing on my own feet that I shall find my bearings and also test my faith in God.

58,"November 20, 1946",STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
  
 November 20, 1946 I find myself in the midst of exaggeration and falsity. I am unable to discover the truth. There is terrible mutual distrust. Oldest
friendships have snapped. Truth and ahimsa by which I swear, and
 which have, to my knowledge, sustained me for sixty years, seem to fail to show the attributes I have ascribed to them.
 To test them, or better, to test myself, I am going to a village called Srirampur, cutting myself away from those who have been with me all these years, and who have made life easy for me. I am taking Prof. Nirmal Kumar Bose as my Bengali teacher and interpreter and Shri Parasuram, who has been my most devoted, selfless and silent stenographer.
 The other workers, whom I have brought with me, will each distribute themselves in other villages of Noakhali to do the work ofpeace, if it is at all possible, between the two communities. They are, unfortunately, all non-Bengalis except little Abhalibtech_102_footnote. They will, there- fore, be accompanied by one Bengali worker each as teacher and interpreter, even like Prof. N. K. Bose will be to me.
 Distribution work and selection work will be done by Shri Satis Chandra Das Gupta of the Khadi Pratishthan. My ideal is to live in a local Muslim League family, but I see that I must not wait for that happy day. I must meanwhile establish such contacts with the Muslims as I can in their own villages. My suggestion to the League Ministers is that they should give me one honest and brave Muslim to accompany one equally honest and brave Hindu for each affected village. They should guarantee, at the cost of their lives if need be, the
 
 
 safety of the returning Hindu refugees. I am sorry to have to confess that without some such thing it seems to me difficult to induce them to return to their villages.
 From all accounts received by me, life is not as yet smooth and safe for the minority community in the villages.  They,  therefore, prefer to live as exiles from their own homes, crops, plantations and surroundings, and live on inadequate and ill-balanced doles.
 Many friends from outside Bengal have written to me to allow them to come for peace work but I have strongly dissuaded them from coming. I would love to let them come if and when I see light through this impenetrable darkness.
 In the meantime, both Pyarelal and I have decided to suspend all other activities in the shape of correspondence, including the heavy work of the Harijan and the allied weeklies. I have asked Shri Kishorelal, Shri Kakasaheb, Shri Vinoba and Shri Narahari Parikh to edit the weeklies jointly and severally. Pyarelal and I may, if our work permits, send stra contributions from our respective villages. Corresp- ondence will be attended to from Sevagram.
 How long this suspense will last is more than I can say. This much, however, I can. I do not propose to leave East Bengal till I am satisfied that mutual trust has been established between the two communities and the two have resumed the even tenor of their life in their villages. Without this there is neither Pakistan nor Hindustan— only slavery awaits India, torn asunder by mutual strife and engrossed in barbarity.
 No one need at present be disturbed about my low diet. On receipt of the following wire from Dr. Rajendra Prasad :“Letter received. Have already wired quiet. There have been no incidents for a week now. Situation satisfactory. Most earnestly desire resumption of normal diet. Myself going Delhi 19th”, I resumed goat’s milk from yesterday and propose to revert to normal diet as early as the system permits. The future is in God’s keeping.

59,"November 20, 1946","SPEECH AT PRAYER
MEETINGlibtech_103_footnote","
         SRIRAMPUR, 
  November 20, 1946 Speaking after the prayer at Srirampur to an audience of about a thousand persons, Gandhiji said that he had never imagined he would be able to come and settle  down in a devastated village in Noakhali so soon. This had become possible through  Satish 	Babu’s efforts. He had come here alone, with two companions only. 	One was to act as his interpreter and teach him Bengali, while the 	other, Shri Parasuram, who was from Malabar, had been brought along 	because he knew no Bengali and little Hindustani and so could not be 	set up in a village alone. For all practical purposes he had thus 	come here alone. His companions had been left behind at Kazirkhil, 	and each of them was likewise to choose one village for himself. His 	idea was that every Hindu worker thus sent should be accompanied by 	a single Mussalman worker, and both of them together should mix with 	the local people and gradually create an atmosphere in which the 	refugees would shed their fear and be able to come back and live in 	peace and friendship once more. For a Mussalman worker he depended 	on Shaheed Saheb and Shamsuddin Saheb. But he could not afford to 	wait until such a worker was available. He had, therefore, come here 	as soon as he found the opportunity. It was good that some 	Mussalmans were present in the meeting and two local Mussalman 	friends had already invited him to visit their homes. They had 	assured him that they also wanted the Hindus back in the village, 	but the Hindus were not yet in the proper frame of mind to do so.  Fear 	is a thing  which 	 he  disliked. Why  should  one  man  be 	 afraid  of another man? 	Man should stand in 	fear of 	God alone, 	and then 	he can shed all other 	fears. Pyarelal had come 	to the 	meeting a 	short while ago. 	On his 	way, he had 	met about 150 refugees 	who were going away 	from the village with 	their belongings. 	On enquiry 	the refugees 	had told 	him that 	they were afraid that when the 	military and 	police left there would 	be fresh 	trouble. Whilst 	the roads 	were safe, therefore, 	they took the opportunity 	of  moving 	 away  to  some  place  	of   safety. But the man 	who is possessed 	by fear 	will not find safety 	anywhere. What help can 	the military 	or the 	police give to 	such a 	man? To 	depend on 	military and 	police aid 	is to add 	to one’s 	helplessness. He 	would therefore 	like these refugees 	to develop personal 	courage so 	that they would consider 	it beneath 	their dignity to fly 	from fancied 	danger merely for fear of 	losing their 	lives. Therefore, the 	better course for 	intending refugees would 	be to derive 	personal courage from men 	like him 	who went to the affected villages, assuming of course that these had the requisite courage.  But 	whether he could personally infuse such courage in another man or 	not he    
 did not know. So long he had lived amidst a number of companions. But now he had begun to say to himself, “Now is the time. If you want to know yourself, go forth alone.” It was therefore that he had come practically alone like this to the present village. With unquenchable faith in God he proposed to persevere so as to succeed in disarming all opposition and inspiring confidence.
 He would live here amidst the Muslim villagers, form intimate acquaintance with each family, know their mind, and help them also to know his mind. When they thus knew one another intimately, then would perhaps come the time when the atmosphere would change and sweetness prevail in the relations between Hindus and Mussalmans, where sourness was prevailing today.

 You are not to proceed to your village. Those who go to village have to go there with the determination to do or die. If they fall ill, they must get well or die there. Then alone would their going have any meaning. In practice, this means that in  case  of  illness,  they  must be content to do with home remedies or the therapy of nature’s elements. Sushila’s medical services are not supposed to be available to the members of our party. Her services are all premortgaged to the village folk of East Bengal. She has her work cut out in her  village. libtech_108_footnote
 It won’t do to live in the villages like a jinn. We must learn to live and move with the proverbial cautiousness and wisdom of a she- elephant. Then alone shall we have the fitness to live there.

 SRIRAMPUR,
 November 22, 1946 Gandhiji told them that if Noakhali set any precedent in the transfer of population to other districts in Bengal, other provinces might follow it, and such a
 policy would be suicidal for the whole country. He could never approve of such a
 scheme. He would not advise the people to leave their homes and go away somewhere else. The Bengalees were always in the forefront of civilized life in bravery and sacrifice and it was really shocking to find that people would run away in fear giving up their hearths and homes. He wanted to see every Hindu family settle down in its own village and face the situation fearlessly and with courage.
 Concluding, Gandhiji told them that the present problem was not the question of Noakhali alone; it was a problem for the whole of Bengal and the whole of India.

Mahatma Gandhi—The Last Phase, Vol. I, Book II, p. 40       	There is a saying in English, “The King is dead, Long Live the 	King”. The same may be said with reference to Malaviyaji. 	Malaviyaji was born for India and lives in the works he did for 	India. They were many. They were great works. The most magnificent 	among them is the Hindu Vishva Vidyalaya. We erroneously call it the 	Benares Hindu University. For this, not Malaviyaji but his followers 	are to blame.      
 Malaviyaji was a servant of his servants. He let his followers do as they liked. I know he was full of such magnanimity. He had it to the point of a fault. But the saying ‘no blame attaches to the mighty’ applies equally to Malaviyaji. He cherished the name Hindu Vishva Vidyalaya. The correction is even now due. Every stone of this University should reflect Hindu dharma. Not a single building should symbolize the materialism of the West, rather, it should stand for spirituality. The same should go for the teachers and scholars. Is that so today? Can it be said that every scholar of the University is a living embodiment of pure religion? If not, why not? The University will be judged not by the number of its scholars but by the degree to which they exemplify Hindu dharma, however small their number.
 I know the task is an arduous one. But this is of essence for the University. If this be not so, the University is no- thing. The duty, therefore, of Malaviyaji’s sons and followers is clear. What place does Hinduism occupy in the world today? What are its blemishes? How can they be removed? It is for the devotees of Malaviyaji to answer these questions. Malaviyaji has left us his bequest. To make it lasting and to develop it would be the right memorial for him.
 Malaviyaji collected a great deal of money for the University, but a great deal still remains to be collected. Everyone can make his contribution to this work.
 So much for his outward activity. His inner life was of the  purest. He was an ocean of kindness. His knowledge of the Shastras was immense. Bhagavata was his most favourite book. He was a competent preacher. His memory was prodigious. His life was clean and simple.
 I leave out his politics and his other manifold activities. He whose life was dedicated to selfless service and who was endowed with so many gifts, could not be confined in his activities. I have wanted to draw attention only to the most abiding of his works. Those who wish to make of the University an institution full of purity, would better study, ponder and follow the ideals of Malaviyaji.

  November 	23, 1946  Gandhiji 	said his advice to them was that all must help in the work of the 	Peace Committeelibtech_126_footnotelibtech_127_footnotethat had been 	formed and 	strengthen its 	hands. By 	staying out 	of the 	Committee and 	carrying on 	Press propaganda they 	would not be helping 	the cause. 	He wanted 	to tell 	them his own experience 	in Champaran. 	As a 	result of 	the struggle 	there, a Commission of 	Enquiry was appointed. He was requested to become a member 	of the Commission 	unconditionally. He 	consulted his 	friends and 	accepted the 	offer. The 	result was 	that the 	indigo monopoly ended. It 	was probably 	a century-old 	wrong. Seven 	times the labourers 	had rebelled 	before. Each time the 	rebellion was 	put down ruthlessly, 	so that 	their condition was worse 	than before.  Similarly, 	let everyone join the Peace Committee and air his views before it.  Probably 	there would be redress of every legitimate grievance.  They 	had heard the speeches of Minister Shamsuddin Saheb, Parliamentary 	Secretary Hamiduddin Saheb and others. They had requested the 	refugees to return to      
 their villages and had assured them that they would guarantee their safety and honour. They should accept their assurance.
 They might say all this was mere talk. They had been deceived before. It was beneath one’s dignity to distrust a man’s word without sufficient ground. If all Muslims were liars, Islam could not be a true religion. But his knowledge of history contradicted such a theory. A false thing could not last long in this world.
 Islam spread amongst crores of people all over the world. It spread mostly because of its own intrinsic merits. Here were elected Muslims who were running the Government of the Province who gave them their word of honour. His advice to Hindus was to believe their word and give them a trial. This did not  mean  that there would not be a single bad Mussalman left in East Bengal. There were good and bad men amongst all communities. Dishonourable conduct would break any ministry or organization in the end. Shamsuddin Saheb had told them plainly that Pakistan could not be achieved by cruel deeds. It was clear to him as daylight that if they kept quarrelling amongst themselves, a third power was bound to rule over them. Whether it was British or Allied Powers, it made no difference. They would remain slaves.
 There was a time when Hindus and Muslims had been united. There was the pact of unity between the League and the Congress in 1916. Whether it was good or bad was not the question. He was a newcomer in India at that time and hardly knew anybody or affairs in this country. Then came the Khilafat Movement and there was a communal unity that had never been seen before that. Today Hindus were frightened when they heard the cries of “Allah-o-Akbar”. In those days, these were the slogans repeated at all meetings: “Vande mataram”, “Allah-o-Akbar” and “Sat Sri Akal”. Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs in their thousands shouted these slogans with one voice. They were the same people today. Those  who  were  youngsters  in  those  days were grown-up men today. Why could not they live together as friends now? Gandhiji was not prepared to admit that bitterness had gone so deep that it could not be overcome.
 The Peace Committee could not function without their help. If they wanted real peace there was no other way except to have mutual trust and confidence. Bihar, they said, had avenged Noakhali. Supposing Muslims in East Bengal or Muslims all over India made up their minds to avenge Bihar, where would India be?
 Gandhiji said that where houses had been burnt and destroyed, Government was, he understood, raising new ones. If there were any difficulties or they were harassed in any way after they returned to their villages, they should place their complaints before the Peace Committee.
 The speaker referred to a letter that had been handed to him during the meeting.   It was said that in Chandipur the damage amounted to a crore of rupees and it should be compensated. He did not know whether it was a crore or a lakh. But the Government
 was bound to do what it could in such matters.
 Then it was said in the letter that the Chief Minister’s speeches breathed fire. God alone knew the hearts of men. He could not say whether Suhrawardy Saheb was a good man or a bad one. But he knew that he was elected by the voters. Hindus and Muslims had to live under his Government just as those in Bihar had to live under the rule of the Congress Government. If people did not like a particular Government the electorate could change it. But it was not in his power to do so.
 The letter further said that the Superintendent of Police was a bad man and should be sent away from Noakhali. Again, he did not know whether the Police Superintendent was a good man or bad. But he had the confidence of his chief. Gandhiji himself had come into contact with him fairly frequently during the last few days and he felt that the Superintendent would deny those charges if they were false, and express regret for his mistake if they were true. But he wanted to tell them this. If he was bad, it was so because the people of Noakhali were bad. There were very few men who remained good in the midst of bad people. All those in the Congress were not angels.
 Then there was a request that the military must stay on. According to the present constitution, the military had to act under the orders of the Ministers. That was democracy. When the Ministers themselves were offering to become their soldiers, why should they ask for the military? After all, if the worst came to the worst they could only lose their lives. They must do so as brave men and women. By running away from East Bengal they would become the worst cowards. He could never wish that for anybody.
 If all Hindus were bad, Hinduism must be bad. If all Muslims were bad, Islam must be bad. But neither Hinduism nor Islam was bad. Christ had said that he alone was His disciple who did His work, not he who merely called him ‘Lord, Lord’. That applied to all religions.
 If Shamsuddin Saheb and his companions did not mean what they said they would know. Gandhiji for one did not wish to be a living witness of such a tragedy.

You 	are right. G. 	And attempt up to the last is the only real test.  Bose 	next asked Gandhiji if there was any change of mentality on the part 	of      
 the authorities. Gandhiji replied :
 There is a change in the Government policy for the better. But as for the change of heart, it is for you and me to make a contribution to that consummation.
 The interviewer remarked that it was painful to see how listless the Hindus had become. Gandhiji replied :
 It is  no  prerogative  of the  Hindus.  Listlessness  is  common  to us all. Even if I am the only one, I shall fight this listlessness that has come over the Hindus of East Bengal. I have not come here to do  a good turn to this community or that. I have come to do a good turn to myself. Non-violence is not meant to be practised by the individual only. It can be and has to be practised by society as a whole. I have come to test that for myself in Noakhali. Has my ahimsa become bankrupt? If I fail here, it won’t be any proof that the theory is wrong. It will simply mean that my sadhana has been imperfect, that there is some fault somewhere in my technique.
 B. If the League leaders were to take the Noakhali situation as seriously as  you and Jawaharlal took Bihar, order would be restored in a day.
To make such comparisons is to degrade oneself. What is called
for is introspection and more introspection.
 I have come here not only to speak to the Mussalmans but to the Hindus as well. Why are they such cowards? The Harijans, the Namashudras, have been relatively better so far as courage and  physical prowess is concerned. They are brave. But the other Hindus must shed utterly the caste distinctions. If this calamity would open the eyes of the Hindus and result in eradicating untouchability root and branch, it will have served a good purpose.
 Narrating his earlier experiences in India he recalled how  during  the Champaran Satyagraha, in Rajendra Babu’s absence, he could only sit in the outhouse in Rajendra Babu’s house and how Rajendra Babu’s servant would not let the speaker bathe at the well. Things had improved, but much more remained to be done.
 The visitor agreed that Hinduism had still to go a long way to eradicate the evil. Talking of forced conversions in Noakhali, the interviewer remarked that unless those who had been converted were brought back to the Hindu fold quickly, the cleavage between the Hindus and the Muslims might become permanent.
G. Many had returned. But all must.
 The question was put to him whether by taking up an unbending attitude on conversion, he was not identifying himself with one particular community. How
 could his stand in this respect be squared with his claim that he regarded all religions as equal?libtech_140_footnote
G. I have, of course, always believed in the principle of
 religious tolerance. But I have even gone further. I have advanced from tolerance to equal respect for all religions. All religions are branches of the same mighty tree, but I must not change over from one branch to another for the sake of expediency. By doing so, I cut the branch on which I am sitting. Therefore, I always feel the change- over from one religion to another very keenly, unless it is a case of spontaneous urge, a result of inner growth. Such conversions by their very nature cannot be on a mass scale and never to save one’s life or property or for temporal gain.
 He narrated his meeting with a South Indian Bishop who was a Harijan converted to Christianity and retained all his original weakness in spite of the change of religion. He had told the late Charlie Andrews that to his mind he was no bishop at all.
 B.	There is no end to the monstrosities that have been committed here and that too in the name of religion. It is enough to fill one with blank despair.
G. I have met human monsters from my early youth. I have
 found that even they are not beyond redemption if we know how to touch the right chord in their soul.
 And he cited two instances within his recent experience of the milk of human kindness welling up in hard-boiled, sun-baked functionaries at the sight of stark human misery and devastation.
G. The whole thing is so ghastly. You do not need to exa-
 ggerate it. I have told the authorities I do not care for numbers. Has a single case of abduction, rape, forcible marriage, or forcible conver- sion occurred? If so, it is enough for me. It is admitted that such things have happened.
 B.   What about the rescue of abducted women? It was complained that as soon   as information was received about such cases and the rescue party with the military police set out on their assignment, the miscreants received intimation and removed the victim to some other place.
G.    I have told our people :‘Do not depend on military and the
 police help.’ You have to uphold democracy, and democracy and dependence on the military and the police are incompatible. You cannot say it is good in one place and bad in another. Military help
 
 will degrade you.libtech_141_footnotelibtech_142_footnoteIn a democracy, if   you set up a hooligan as the head of the Government, you lie in the bed you have made. The only remedy is to educate and convert the electorate by satyagraha, if necessary. We should be consistent all along. If democracy is good in Bihar, it ought to be good in Bengal, too. I must, therefore, go to the popular, elected Ministers, for they are my Ministers. If they fail, public opinion must be created to  replace  them.  That  is  de- mocracy. Whether it is  Bihar  or Bengal,  the  people  have  to  be brave and stand on their legs. I want everyone to die at his post like a brave man and not to leave his home or his village.
 Another interviewerlibtech_143_footnoteasked Gandhiji why Pandit Jawaharlal went to Bihar and took such an active part in putting down disturbances there while he did nothing for Bengal. If the Interim Government could not interfere in one Province because of provincial autonomy, how could it do so in another?
 Gandhiji replied that they must not forget that besides being  the  Vice- President of the Interim Government, Jawaharlal was the first servant of the Congress. As the Vice-President of the Central Cabinet, he must act within the four corners of the constitution. It does not permit interference with provincial autonomy. But in Bihar, Pandit Nehru and Rajendra Babu have a standing and responsibility as Congressmen.
 One of the interviewers remarked that Bengal was being used as a pawn on the political chess-board.
G. No. Bengal is in the forefront today because Bengal is
 Bengal. It is Bengal that produced Tagore and Bankim Chandra. It was here that the heroes of the Chittagong Armoury Raid were born, however misguided their action might have been in my eyes. No, you must understand it. If Bengal plays the game, it will solve all India’s problem. That is why I have made myself a Bengali.libtech_144_footnotelibtech_145_footnoteI  have  seen enough of ravages in Noakhali to make me weep my eyes out but  I am not going to shed a tear for what has happened. We have  a  long way yet to go. Why should there be cowardice in the Bengal of such men?
 B. Yes, when I see these desecrated places of worship, I ask, why did not every man, woman and child of the house die there before those places were touched.
 
   Phase.     Phase.      
 Q. If they had done that, you would not have required any  other help. Today Noakhali is bereft of its leading men. They refused to take the risk and have left their hearths and homes.  Poor Manoranjan Babu is in a fix. Whom is he to put on the Peace Committees? I have told him that the common man must rise to fill the vacuum. There is no such thing as a vacuum in nature. Nature abhors it. Let him write to them, I have told him. If they come back, well and good. Otherwise, the common man must come forward. It is his day.
 Q. Mahatmaji, tell us in one word, whether it is war or  peace?  Peace Committees or War Committees?
G. Peace Committees. War results when peace fails. Our effort
 must always be directed towards peace, but it must be peace with honour and fair security for life and property. On  these  two conditions alone will the refugees return. Of course, if they develop enough courage, they will return without any safeguards. Today I have suggested one Hindu and one Muslim standing surety for each village. If the people have the requisite courage, they would depend on none but God and their own strength of spirit for their defence. If they do that, all the goondas in Noakhali will feel the change in the atmosphere and behave decently. I know what I am saying. I come from Kathiawad, a Province notorious for its bandits. I know that they are not beyond redemption. Nor do I believe that goondas are responsible for all that had happened.
 A suggestion was next made as to why they should not have only Muslims in the Peace Committees as the Hindus had played no part in breaking the peace.
 G. No. The Hindus must be there to play their part, else the Peace Committees will be a farce.libtech_146_footnote
 B. Was it not possible no control Bihar with non-violence? Why did the Congress Ministers resort to the free use of Military there?libtech_147_footnote
 G. Yes. But Bihar has been having a lesson  in  organized  violence since 1942 and before. Our weakness for the goondas rose to the highest in 1942. I know the merits of 1942. The people were not
 
 cowed down. But all the same I cannot shut my eyes to our mistakes. We have to learn to do better [or else pay the penalty].

  November 	24, 1946  	I am sorry I had to start the weekly silence earlier than usual. 	Such was Shamsuddin Saheb’s order. But wherever I may happen to 	be, my heart is here. I can have no peace until the Muslim brothers 	and sisters of the village call back the Hindus who used to live 	here, and they return to their homes.

If you want to go to Vinoba, you may. But your first task 	is to improve your health. I cannot move from here. Give me all the 	news about the Congress. Of course, you are already rendering 	service. Who was at fault at Garhmukteshwar?libtech_149_footnote  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G. N. 2493       RAMGUNJ,  November 	25, 1946  	Brothers, I had no desire to speak to you tonight, for, as you see, 	my voice is still very weak. Let me hope that your work will proceed 	well. But 	there are indications that trouble is brewing even now. I     
 have just received a wire from Sandwip and some more complaints which tend to show that all is not well. I am handing them over to Shamsuddin Saheb for enquiry and necessary action, if the reports prove true.
 With  regard  to  the  Peace  Committees  formed  in   villages,libtech_150_footnotea complaint has reached me that some of the Muslim members on the Committees are not reliable. The Hindus stand in fear of them but have not the courage to speak out openly. But unless they muster such courage, and if wrong people are left there, the Committees will not be able to command confidence. What we really want is the right sort of person. My suggestion is that if two good and brave men, one  a Hindu and another a Mussalman, take the responsibility of prevent- ing mischief even at the cost of their life, that would be enough. Why should there be eagerness for entering the Committees? It is not a place for acquiring position or honour but a place of service, and if anyone really wishes to serve, he can as well serve outside as on the Committee.
 It is only in order to serve the cause of Islam that the Muslims are being called to join the Committees. The most important task is to restore the confidence among the Hindus so that they would be able to pursue their religious practices in freedom. Mr. Akhil Dutta has lately sent me a cheque for Rs. 850 and a letter stating that 200 pairs of conch-shell bangles and a pound of vermilion had been  despatched to Noakhali. These are for distribution  among  women who had suffered during the riots. The best part of the presents is that they were collected by eleven Muslim gentlemen and one Engli- shman. I have met women who put on the vermilion mark indoors but wipe it off when they stir out in public. Such fear has to be removed by the Muslims. It is not a question of giving monetary aid, but of restoring confidence by respect shown to the culture of others. I will ask my Mussalman friends to treat this as their sacred duty. The Prophet once advised Mussalmans to consider the Jewish places of worship to be as pure as their own and offer it the same protection. It is the duty of the Mussalmans of today to assure the same freedom to their Hindu neighbours. Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah has said that every Muslim must show by his conduct that not a single non-Muslim need be afraid of him, the latter would be guaranteed safety and protection.
 
 For, thus alone can the Mussalmans command honour and respect.

GHANSHYAMDAS,  	You know I am staying at Srirampur all by myself, with only Prof. 	Nirmal Kumarlibtech_151_footnoteBose 	and Parasuram as my companions.  The people with whom I am putting 	up are gentlemen. There is only one Hindu family in the entire 	village, the rest are all Muslims. They all stay widely separated 	from each other. The hundreds of villages here do not maintain much 	contact with each other through any convey- ance after the water 	dries up. The result is that work is possible only on foot. 	Therefore, only desperadoes, hooligans, or able-bodied men can 	maintain contact among themselves. I am living in  one  such village 	at present and intend to spend more time in another village similar 	to this. It is my intention to stay on here so long as the Hindus 	and Muslims do not start living together as sincere friends. God 	alone    
 can keep man’s resolve unshaken. At the moment I have forgotten Delhi, Sevagram, Uruliand Panchgani. My only desire is to do or die. This will test my non-violence, too. I have come here determined to emerge successful from this ordeal. If you are anxious to see me, then you can come over here. I personally do not see any necessity for it. If you wish to send a messenger to know something or carry letters by hand, you can do so.
 I am not going into the Constituent Assembly; it is not quite necessary either. Jawaharlal, Sardar, Rajendra Babu, Rajaji, Maulana— any of these or all five can go—or Kripalani.
Send them the message.
 If it is possible to arrange for a sitting of the Constituent Assembly only with the help of the military, then it is better not to have it. If it can be arranged peacefully, then the laws can be framed only for the participating Provinces. Let us see what the future of the police and the military will be. We have also to see what the Muslim majority Provinces will do, and what is to be done in the Provinces where Muslims are in minority, how the British Government will conduct itself, and how the Princes will react. I believe the State Paper of May 16 will probably have to be changed. The job is complicated enough, if we want to work independently. I have only given an indication of how I view the problem.
 Friends will also do well to bear in mind that what I am doing here is not in the name of the Congress. Nor is there any thought of associating it with this work. What I am doing is only from  my personal view of non-violence. Anybody, if he so desires, can publicly oppose my work. That in fact is his right; it may even be his duty. Therefore, whosoever wishes to do anything or say anything, let him do so fearlessly. If anybody wants to warn me of anything, let him do that too.
 Please send a copy of this to Sardar so that he may tell the others named above. Or you can get copies made and send them to the five friends yourself.
 Do express whatever you wish to. Write to me direct so that I may reply. Pyarelal, Sushila, etc., all are in different villages. Pyarelal has been ill since yesterday. I hope you are all right.

  November 	26, 1946  Gandhiji 	said that even if 	a solitary 	refugee had to return to 	his village 	populated   by   Muslims, 	  he   would   	unhesitatingly   advise 	  his   return. 	   Whe- ther 	they were men or women, 	if they 	were to become 	 brave  people, 	 this  cour- 	 age was  indispensable. 	 Numerous  letters had  been  coming 	 to  him  in  which 	people  had 	 questioned  the  wisdom  of  thus  tempting 	  faith,   but 	  he   held   that this 	was necessary if 	they were to 	become a 	self-respecting nation. 	He made 	no distinction 	between men and women. 	The latter 	should feel just as 	independent as 	men. Bravery 	was not man’s 	monopoly. The art of 	self-defence excluded all 	outside help. 	What he saw and heard 	showed him that 	people were apt to forget 	self-respect in order 	to save themselves. There was no swadesh 	and swaraj for 	persons who would not 	sacrifice themselves or 	their belongings 	for their 	honour. As 	his hearers 	knew, the 	Ministers and 	the Parliamentary 	Secretaries, who had come 	to Noakhali, 	had been 	proclaiming that 	for the sake of their 	honour and 	the influence of 	Islam, they 	were anxious 	that the refugees 	should return to their 	villages and 	feel perfectly safe 	and serene 	in the 	midst of 	the majority 	of Muslims 	living there. The speaker 	had no 	hesitation in 	trusting their pledged 	word and asking 	the people 	to do likewise. 	Those who trusted 	were never the 	losers; deceivers 	ever were. There was no room for goondaism 	in any 	religion worth 	the name, 	be it Islam, 	Hinduism or 	any other. 	He was 	trying to 	become a 	Bengali in 	order that 	if God 	gave him strength, he 	might try 	to live the 	life in 	the midst 	of the 	people of 	East Bengal 	and induce 	them to 	do likewise.  Harijan, 	5-1-1947       November 	27, 1946  	If the refugees had the required spirit of co-operation, it would be 	possible. But it is a plant of slow growth and personal courage does 	not come even from co-operation. It comes when it does  come, 	because it is a virtue which is its own reward. Therefore, the 	principle that there should be volunteers who would go  to  each  	one  of  the    
 affected villages is perfectly sound. You may have noticed that I have been giving effect to it myself and I have made a beginning. Those who came with me from Sevagram are following suit. Whether they will prove themselves worthy of the great trust reposed in them remains to be seen. That may be said even about myself. Only I am not following anybody but am the originator so far as  I  am concerned, of the idea. Therefore, if you have any volunteers in view with the requisite qualifications, please send me their names and addresses.

 Besides, if he allowed volunteers, who might be attracted by the glamour of his presence to inundate Noakhali, it would create unhealthy excitement and cause the authorities and the local Muslims unnecessary trepidation. To make an individual act non-violently he has to be put absolutely at his ease first. Meticulously correct conduct on their part would put the local Muslims and the Bengal Government on their honour. He concluded :
 I am watching what the Government are doing. People cannot be compelled to return to their villages. It would be a disastrous experiment in my opinion.

  November 	27, 1946  QUESTION: 	How do you think lasting 	peace can be achieved by your new plan, unless the Muslim League 	itself which presumably guides the majority of the Muslim 	intelligentsia, sincerely co-operates in creating such atmosphere by 	their words and deeds? GANDHIJI: 	My new plan does contemplate the necessity for a  	lasting peace and sincere co-operation of the Muslim League in 	establishing friendly relations between the two communities, 	irrespec- tive of the merits or otherwise of Pakistan.  Asked 	as to what was the guarantee that some months later this sort of 	calamity would not be repeated in places like Noakhali, where Hindus 	were in a minority, Gandhiji said : The 	only real guarantee is to be sought in the personal courage of 	individuals. Everything else depends on it.  The 	next question 	asked was 	whether he 	should not 	advise people in 	those areas 	where one or 	two houses 	were Hindu 	and the rest Muslim, 	to migrate 	to areas 	inside a district 	where the Hindus 	were in 	comparatively larger 	numbers, so that 	in case 	of emergencies 	they could put up 	some sort of 	resistance if 	they did 	not believe  in 	non-violence. Gandhiji’s 	reply was:    
 There is no such safety as you imagine in numbers in imagined conditions. Migration is no remedy whilst there is hope of co- operation. It will become a necessity when the majority party wishes it,  if a clash is to be avoided. All this is a matter of mutual adjustment, not arbitrary action. What is needed is that barbarities must cease, if we are to survive as one nation or two, or many free nations still living in friendly co-operation.

94,"November 28, 1946",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
  
 
 
 SRIRAMPUR,
  November 28, 1946 Gandhiji related the story of how the Ashram prayer had taken its present shape. When he 	came to India in 1915, 	Gurudev invited 	him through 	the 	late  Deenabandhu 	Andrews to stay at Santiniketan along with the inmates of the 	Phoenix Settlement. Kaka Saheb and Harihar Sharma were there and so 	were the late Deenabandhu Andrews and Pearson. These friends had 	created a sort of South African group at the place. The prayer which 	was recited at that early time by the small group practically 	continues to this day so far as the Sanskrit part is concerned.  While 	on his Harijan tour in Travancore, he added the first Hindu verse of 	the Ishopanishad to 	it, as, in his opinion, it contained the cream of spiritual thought. 	Later on, Raihana Tyabjee, daughter of the late Abbas Tyabjee, who 	is noted for her musical talents, proposed the incorporation of a 	passage from the Koran, and this was done. Lastly, on Kasturba’s 	deathlibtech_157_footnoteat 	the Aga Khan Palace, Dr. Gilderlibtech_158_footnotehad recited a 	passage from the Zoroastrian scripture. Since then that prayer has 	been a part of the Ashram prayer. In addition there was a bhajan 	in an Indian language 	or an English hymn and Ramdhun.  The 	prayer which has thus taken shape can, on no account, be considered 	as belonging to any single community or religion. It is of universal 	appeal; and no one, whatever his denomination may be, should have 	hesitation in sharing it.  Harijan, 	5-1-1947   "

 CHI. BABUDI,
 Chi. Chimanlal writes in his letter that since you are not recovering quickly you are in a hurry to go to Surat. This is not right. Now you should go only after getting fully well. You will thereby be helping Gordhandaslibtech_161_footnotelibtech_162_footnote. If you make up your mind, you can certainly get well in Sevagram. You don’t seem to be suffering from any disease. If you take enough milk, fruit and vegetables, you are bound to get well. You must take hip-baths and friction-baths. Apply mud-
 
 packs regularly and take sun-rays through blue glass. Do you have any problems there? If so, write to me.
 Now about your letter. When I repeat Ramanama, or even otherwise, I have no definite image in my mind. I do not believe in such image-worship. In fact God is without form. There is no need at all to invest Him with a form while worshipping Him. We must believe God to be the absolute Truth and worship Him. He is both the law and the law-giver. If this sinks in one’s mind, there is nothing more to think about. This being so, if you ask what more does one gain by repeating His name, my answer is that, as the saying is, a man becomes what he thinks. By repeating His name, we become one with Him.
 Your mind keeps changing. But don’t worry. Keep on ceaselessly repeating the name, so that no other thoughts may enter the mind. I know it is difficult for the sick to do this. Do not worry about it. If that repetition is diligently done, it sinks in one’s heart and proves an unfailing remedy even for the sick. Do not, therefore, think further but stay on there. Cling to nature-cure remedies and to Rama, and everything will be all right.
I hope Anandlibtech_163_footnotelibtech_164_footnoteis well.

 Though I have noticed it in the Gujarati columns of the Harijanbandhu from a different source, at the risk of repetition in another   form,   I   must   quotelibtech_168_footnotefrom   a   touching   letter   from   Shri Parikshitlal Majumdar addressed to Shyamlaljilibtech_169_footnotelibtech_170_footnote, a copy of which has been sent by the latter.
 I am writing this from Bardoli	This year, during the Gandhi Jayanti
 week, nearly 40  public wells have been freely opened for the Harijans. .  .  .
 People have taken to this programme of their own will	local people have
 invited Harijans and taken them to the  public wells.	I myself have attended
 some functions and personally have become a witness to the marvellous change.	No doubt, it is Gandhiji’s efforts and the recent writings that have
brought this change.	Numerous inter-communal dinners have been  held.
 There was one such big dinner at Nadiad, the real capital of the Kaira District. .
 . . One prominent well has been opened in Kadi, a citadel of orthodoxy and 150 people dined with Harijans at Padra in Baroda. There are numerous such incidents but I cannot enumerate them at present. . . .
 Of course, compared to what we want  to  achieve,  this  pro- gress  is  a  miserable  show.  But  seeing  that   Gujarat  has   been  so far behindhand in this matter of removal of untouchability, the little progress of which Shri Parikshitlal takes note with pardonable
 
 satisfaction is pleasant, if it is permanent and is a precursor of better things to come. Every nail driven into the coffin of untouchability is a step in the right direction towards the purification of Hinduism.

 CORRESPONDENT: Here is one serious difficulty. Canal water will dry up shortly. People will not then be able to leave these villages even if they want to do so. Would you ask them to stay on, or do you want them to leave at once?
 GANDHIJI: I have said at many meetings I have addressed in this part of the country that if the people are brave, whether they are few or many, they will not leave their homes, but will remain there, whatever the risk. And this I say irrespective of military or police protection. It is beneath the dignity of free men or those wanting to be free, to seek such protection. Surely during the past few days much has happened to encourage people to remain in their homes.

Its purport is, 	“Salutation to the Enlightened Ones.”  A 	Japanese Buddhist monklibtech_172_footnotewho had happened to 	stay in Sevagram for two or three years was responsible for its 	introduction. He had come to India with the object of mastering the 	secrets of the religion which had its origin in India. The monk had 	a sweet nature and had endeared himself to every member of the 	Sevagram Ashram by unostentatiousness, affableness and silence. 	Every morning he used to walk round the Ashram grounds for full one 	hour, while beating upon a drum and reciting the above mantra 	in a deep musical 	voice which sent a thrill into all those who heard him. He used to 	recite it at the prayer meeting. The recitation continued even after 	he was removed by the Government after hostilities with Japan began.  Harijan, 	5-1-1947   "

And for doing 	humanitarian work you certainly do not need to tour any part of the 	world to learn the art of doing it. It is the art of humanity which 	is needed and that you will find in all countries and under all 	climes. As I have lived in South Africa for twenty years I know that 	there is

As 	I know to my cost, he is a believer in questionable means so long as 	the end is considered to be good. With him and with men like him the 	end justifies the means. Have you read his book? It is packed with 	untruths almost from beginning to end.

 give you my . . .libtech_188_footnotethat if I do not go out of my way to seek contact with Dr. Ambedkar it is not for want of will or want of regard for you and friends like you but because I know that such seeking will, in my view, harm the cause [rather] than help it. No question of prestige will deter me from walking to him. I can say that the question of prestige has never interfered with my doing what I believed was a duty.

		 PRESSlibtech_197_footnote","
        SRIRAMPUR, 
  [December 2, 1946]libtech_198_footnote  	The question of the exchange  of  population  is  unthinkable and 	impracticable. This question never crossed my mind. In every 	province, everyone is  an  Indian,  be  he  a  Hindu,  a  Muslim  or 	 of any other faith. It would not be otherwise even if Pakistan came 	in full.  	For me any such thing will spell bankruptcy of Indian wisdom or 	statesmanship or both. The logical consequence of any such step is 	too dreadful to contemplate. Is it not that India should be 	artificially divided into so many religious zones?  When 	asked if, in view of the unsettled situation, it was not better to 	adopt a migration policy, Gandhiji said : I 	see nothing to warrant such a policy. It is one of despair and, therefore, 	to be adopted in rare cases as a last resort.  QUESTION: 	You said the other day 	that there was no limit to your stay in East Bengal. Do you think 	that by confining yourself to Srirampur you will be able to send 	your message of peace to other villages of Noakhali? GANDHIJI: 	Of course, I am not burying myself long in Sriram-  	pur. I am not idle here. I am seeing people of the surrounding 	villages and others. I am studying things and regaining lost 	physical strength meanwhile. The idea ultimately is to go on foot, 	when possible and necessary, from village to village and induce the 	evacuees to return. This I can only do with effect when I have seen 	things myself. It is quite clear to me that my mere word carries 	very little weight. Distrust has gone too deep for exhortation.  Gandhiji 	was next asked 	regarding the report that 	he found himself in darkness, 	and why and when 	the darkness 	came over him 	and whether he 	saw any 	release from it. Gandhiji 	said : I 	am afraid the report is substantial. Outside circumstances  	have never overwhelmed me.The reason for the present daness lies 	within me. I find that my ahimsa does not seem to answer in the 	matter of Hindu-Muslim relations. This struck me forcibly when I 	came to learn of the events in Noakhali.     
 The reported forcible conversions and the distress of the Bengali sisters touched me deeply. I could do nothing through pen or speech.  I argued to myself that I must be on the scene of action and test the soundness of the doctrine which has sustained me and made life worth living. Was it the weapon of the weak as it was often held by my critics or was it truly the weapon of the strong? The question arose in me when I had no ready-made solution for the distemper of which Noakhali was such a glaring symptom.
 And so setting aside all my activities, I hastened to Noakhali to find out where I stood. I know positively that ahimsa is a perfect instrument. If it did not answer in my hands, the imperfection was in me. My technique was at fault. I could not discover the error from a distance. Hence I came here trying to make the discovery. I must, therefore, own myself in darkness till I see light. God only knows when it will come. More I cannot say.

  December 2, 1946 Speaking after prayer, Gandhiji chose as his theme the story referred to in the  bhajan which had just been sung. The chief of the elephants had gone for a drink to  the 	river when he was caught hold of by an alligator. A furious struggle 	ensued, but in  spite 	of his strength, the elephant was dragged into deeper waters. When 	he was on the point of being drowned, the elephant realized that his 	huge strength was of no avail, and he prayed to God for succour. 	God, the help of the helpless, came to his rescue and saved him from 	the jaws of death.  The 	moral was obvious. The strength of the strong without God’s help 	had been often found to be useless. Therefore, he advised dependence 	not on outside sources but upon the inner strength which came to all 	who sincerely sought it from God. This was the lesson which the 	people in Noakhali sorely needed to learn.  Harijan, 	5-1-1947       December 	2, 1946  	Must stop.  Even the left hand now aches and has struck work.

	 CONSTITUENT  ASSEMBLYlibtech_200_footnote","
  
 SRIRAMPUR,  NOAKHALI,
 December 3, 1946
 I am quite clear that if there is a boycott by the Muslim League of    the    Constituent    Assembly,libtech_201_footnotelibtech_202_footnoteit    should    not    meet    under    the Cabinet Mission’s statementlibtech_203_footnotelibtech_204_footnoteof May 16.  It clearly contemplates the co-operation of the two major parties, viz., the Congress and the League. Therefore, if one of them proclaims a boycott, the Consti- tuent Assembly cannot with propriety meet under that Paper. If the Government convene the Constituent Assembly in spite of the boycott, they can legitimately do so only under some other statement which they can draw up in consultation with the Congress. It should never be forgotten that however powerful the Congress has become, Constituent Assembly as contemplated today can only meet by action of the British Government.
  Even 	 if  the  Constituent   Assembly   meets   in   spite   of   the 	boycott, but 	with the 	willing co-operation 	of the 	British Gover- 	nment, it 	will be 	under the 	visible or 	invisible protection of 	the British 	forces, whether Indian 	or European. 	In my opinion, 	94 we shall 	never reach 	a satisfactory 	constitution under these circumstances. Whether 	we own it or not, our weakness will be felt by the whole world.  It 	may be 	said that not 	to meet 	as a 	Constituent Assembly 	under these 	circumstances will amount to 	a surrender to 	Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah 	or the 	Muslim League. 	I do 	not mind 	the charge 	because the 	waiver will not be 	an act of 	weakness, it will be one 	of Congress 	strength because it 	would be 	due to 	the logic 	of facts. 	If we have 	attained a 	certain degree 	of status 	and strength 	to warrant us in 
 
 convening our own Constituent Assembly irrespective of the British Government, it will be a proper thing. We will have then to seek the co-operation of the Muslim League and all the parties including the Princes, and the Constituent Assembly can meet at a favourable place even if some do not join. Thus it may be only the Congress Provinces plus Princes who may care to join. I think this would be dignified and wholly consistent with facts.

   Somehow 		or other 		the Committees 		that were being formed 		do not 		appear to 		be functioning 		properly. As yet, 		they have failed to 		inspire confidence.

He will make or mar me. For Him it will be all making, 	never marring.  	Newspapers do not come here regularly. When they come, they come 	behind time and what does come is local newspapers. Therefore, one 	does not know what appears in the Press. My pres- cription i“Don’t 	believe what appears in the Press”, and remember that no news is 	good news.  Do you know that A. J. Balfourlibtech_214_footnotelibtech_215_footnotelibtech_216_footnotewhen 	he was Prime Minister used to boast that he never read newspapers 	and lost nothing.  	Then I suppose you know that all my companions  are distributed in 	different villages. Pyarelal sees me often but he is not with me. He 	is in a village by himself assisted by a Bengali interpreter.  I 	have Parasuram with me and therefore am able to dictate. The 	original idea was that I should take and want no assistance except a 	Bengali interpreter. Parasuram always helped Pyarelal but here he 	could not be placed by himself in a village. He was naturally 	anxious  to be with me directly but he could not when I had all 	other assistance and was doing another class of work.  Now  that  he 	 is  here,  in addition to looking after me personally, he does my 	shorthand     
 work, which enables me to go through what I had not expected or bargained for. And the Bengali assistant is a Professor who has for years made a deep study of my writings. Therefore, I have got most desirable assistance, but that assistance cannot cope with newspapers. Hence my outside work has been reduced to a minimum.
 The work here is new, very pleasant, equally taxing. My ahimsa is on its trial. More of this another time. This is only to relieve you  of all anxiety on my behalf. I am now taking or trying to take the usual diet but it may take some time after the twenty-one days’ denial to get used to it. I am progressing towards normal strength as quickly as I can. I dare not be in a hurry.
Now I see you resumed the thread you left on November 18, on
  Your 	problems are 	extraordinary but 	they are 	all of your 	own making.Therefore 	you can, 	as you 	must, reduce them to 	a manageable degree. 	You will not find the 	men or the 	man by searching. 	He or 	they will come to 	you if 	God wants 	you to 	do the type 	of work 	for which 	you want 	the man. 	I will, 	therefore say, 	wait on Him 	and do what 	you can with-out vexing 	the soul. 	Krishnachandra, I think, 	will not 	come. He 	is now content 	to be under 	Vinoba and gives 	him full 	satisfaction and, 	so far 	as I 	know, is 	himself satisfied. 	He has 	not written to 	me for over 	a month. 	I know 	no other 	person whom I can 	send to 	you, nor 	do I 	think will 	Ghanshyamdasji be 	able to 	give you 	any guidance. 	He can 	only give you 	money but 	that is 	not what 	you need 	or should 	need. The Ashram 	is purely 	your own original 	idea.  If 	the present 	site is 	not suitable 	for you, 	you should 	make what use you 	can of it. 	Personally, I 	would say, give up 	the idea 	of Ashram 	life except 	for your 	own person. 	Then you won’t 	feel cramped and you 	can expand 	as high 	or as broad 	as the 	universe. You 	know that as 	ashram I 	disbanded Sabarmati and 	it became 	a Harijan 	institution. The 	original was 	Satyagraha Ashram. That 	is gone 	for ever. 	Do not 	therefore ever think of 	handing over to 	anybody else the 	Ashram of 	your conception. 	Have in 	the present 	place married men or 	bachelors or 	whoever serves 	efficiently the 	activities you 	may take up. 	Othe- rwise, 	you will 	break down in health 	in spite 	of the most 	ideal weather you 	can have. Remember that 	in all 	I have 	said in the 	foregoing I 	have made the 	fullest allowance 	for your 	conception of 	the Ashram 	and because I have done so I have advised you to restrict the Ashram 
 ideal to yourself, taking as your co-workers as many capable persons as you can get so long as their presence or manners do not jar on you or interfere with  your own growth.libtech_217_footnote
 I hope I have carried to you the whole of my meaning. If so, I have done.

        DEAR 	FRIEND,  SRIRAMPUR 	(EAST BENGAL),  December 	4, 1946 
  	Sardar Bahadur Sir Datar Singh of the Department of Agriculture, 	Government of India, New Delhi, writes to me to say that difficulty 	is being experienced in their land being restored to the Calcutta 	Pinjrapole Society. This was seized for military purposes evidently 	during the war period. The reason given for the refusal is that “the 	Provincial Government have under consideration a scheme for the 	development of the Kanchrapara area”. I fancy that  the decision 	about the development scheme must necessarily take a longtime to 	make. When and if it is made there should be no diffi- culty in the 	Government appropriating the restored land. Meanwhile, it could be 	utilised for a benevolent purpose, namely, increase in the     
 supply of milk for the city of Calcutta. Of course, the stipulation for restoration may well be made that the reverted land should be used only for the above purpose.

CHAKRAVARTYlibtech_224_footnote","
         [December 4, 1946]libtech_225_footnote  At 	meal time Prof. Amiya Chakravarty of the Calcutta University, who 	had come to him on a visit, asked him the question as to what should 	be the technique for approaching the wrongdoers so that their 	resistance should be dissolved. “The chief difficulty with the 	callous perpetrators of crimes is,” Dr. Chakravarty remarked, 	“that they are not only unrepentant but defiant and even jubilant 	over their misdeeds.” Gandhiji replied : Yes, 	they have their own reason  to   be   jubilant  and  the  only  	way to meet their attitude is  not  to  succumb  to  it  but  to  	live  in  their midst and retain one’s  sense  of  truth.  	Goodness  must  be joined with knowledge. Mere goodness is  not  of  	much  use  as  I have found in life. One must cultivate the fine, 	discriminating quality which goes with spiritual courage and 	character. One must know, in a crucial situation, when to speak and 	when to be silent, when to act and     
 when to refrain. Action and non-action in these circumstances become identical instead of being contradictory.
 I am groping for light. I am surrounded by darkness; but I must act or refrain as guided by truth. I find that I have not the patience and the technique needed in these tragic circumstances; suffering and evil often overwhelms me and I stew in my own juice. Therefore, I have told my friends that they should bear with me and work or refrain as guided by wisdom which is now utterly demanded of us. This darkness will break and, if I see light even those who created the tragedy of the recent communalism in Bengal, will.libtech_226_footnote
 The new basis has to be built here in the villages where the Hindus and the Muslims have lived and suffered together in the land of their forefathers and must live together in the future. For the time being I have become a Bengali and a Noakhali man. I have come to live and share their task, to cement the two together or to perish in the attempt. I am in the midst of a raging fire and will stay here till it is put out. For this reason, I do not want to leave these parts. Life must  be made livable for the sorely afflicted men and women. The work of organization must go on and the physical as well as moral rescue achieved.
 Dr. Chakravarty next suggested that the reports from Gandhiji’s associates who are now working separately in the different villages should be collected and collated so that fellow-workers could gain new light on the technique of the non- violence of the strong that was being evolved and experimented within East Bengal. Gandhiji replied :
The time is not yet ripe for that.libtech_227_footnotelibtech_228_footnoteThey have gone with my best
 wishes but to an atmosphere which is still unhelpful. They are following not a beaten path but a trackless route. Their work lies in the midst of a Muslim population. They do not know the language and are not familiar with local problems. I myself don’t know what the next step is and cannot guide them. They are unable to send reports now. If I made a chart for them, they would be able to keep a log-book. Even the great Thakkar Bapa, as old as myself, a seasoned worker and utterly selfless, is working away without knowing what he is doing—a thing he has never done before in his life. But I am hopeful that order will come out of what is for us the necessary chaos. Then what you wish, and I also, will be forthcoming and will be a most
 
 valuable record for future workers.
 A. C. That is what all our people feel and also workers abroad. Noakhali has now become a laboratory where a crucial test is being made; the remedy will apply to situations all the world over where disputes arise between  communities  and nationalities and a new technique is needed for peaceful adjustment.
G. From London too I have heard to the same effect. People
 are interested in what happens in Noakhali. I feel that  my  responsibility is great and that our work has to ring true.
 A. C. That Bengal should be chosen for this great task, that you should have made this your centre, is, to us, a supreme privilege though people have suffered and are suffering beyond description. The whole of Bengal is conscious of your arrival and of the fact that you have come to live and work with the suffering men and women who need you so much at this hour.
G.	For me, if this thing is pulled through, it will be the
 crowning act of my life. I had to come down to the soil and to the people of East Bengal. The first person to whom I mentioned this was Jawaharlal. Without a moment’s hesitation he replied: “Yes, your place is there. Although we need you so much here, we need you more in Noakhali.” I asked him, “When?” As soon as you feel like it,” he replied. In two days I started.

When played well it had a 	sweetness all its own. 	He had also appreciated the namasankirtan; 	but he 	hoped that it 	did not come 	merely from the 	throat but 	from their heart. For, a 	parrot also can 	repeat what it 	learns from its master. 	There is hardly any virtue when we take the name of God when we live in safety. It becomes real only when taken in danger.  He 	would never mind if a Hindu recited the kalma 	willingly and with a 	full     
 heart. But if he did so out of fear of losing his life or possessions, then he took the name of God in vain, for it was the voice of Satan which then spoke through him. As he understood Islam, it had never prospered nor could prosper by means of force. Any man who pretended to serve Islam in that manner only did a disservice to the noble religion.
 Every religion today had become tainted by unwanted accretions. In Hinduism we treated a large part of our brethren as untouchables, and Gandhiji said he had no doubt that we were paying sorrowfully for that sin.
 The first verse of the Ishopanishad contained the essence of Hindu spiritual experience. The purport of the verse was that all that existed in the universe was pervaded by and had its being in God. Therefore, no man could claim anything as his own. He should dedicate his body, mind and all that he possessed to that Universal Being and use only what he received through His grace. The moral of it was that we should deprive no man of his wealth, whether it be in the shape of life, honour or religion. A believer in this truth, living up to it, shed all fear and lived in perfect peace.
 The verseslibtech_231_footnoteof the Bhagavad Gita were then referred to as they formed the next item in the Ashram’s evening prayer. They described the characteristics of one who had attained knowledge and brought his senses under full control. The lesson of the Bhagavad Gita was meant not for those who had forsaken the world, but for every householder, irrespective of his birth and state. Everybody’s duty should be to attain the state described therein and this could only be done if life was built on the rock of fearlessness.

  	I have your letter full of pathos and also full of news which I 	would not have got otherwise. I like your frankness. Who does not 	like life? Therefore, it is no fault in you that you should like 	life and that you should have also likes and dislikes. But though 	these are common to mankind we have got to overcome them if life is 	to become rich in reality, and the memory of departed dear ones is 	to become a treasure.

You should therefore try to do so.  	I am glad you went to Phoenix to help Manilal when he was so much in 	need of your help. I am glad Isele has qualified as a doctor and 	that she has got a permanent job as house physician in  the  General 	Hospital. Are you otherwise at peace with yourself? Manilal will 	tell you that I am at present engaged in tackling the most difficult 	piece of work in my life and I am staying in a most inaccessible 	part of India at the present moment.

  	I have your letter with enclosures. I have studied all the papers 	you have sent to me. Your statement appears to me to be in order so 	far as it goes. But I do feel that if the new policylibtech_237_footnotebecomes popular with the masses, the concentrated 	production of cotton will become decentralised and distributed like 	khadi cloth itself and to that extent the Presidency will be the 	gainer, as the whole of India will, if it takes up the Madras 	policy, as it will, if Madras succeeds, as it ought to if the 	villagers take up khadi with zest. They will, if khadi becomes 	cheaper than unprotected mill cloth, as Shri Manu Subedar has shown 	from the figures, which I have printed in Harijan.  	The argument in the cuttings you have been good enough to send me 	makes no appeal to me and if I get time from the heavy Noakhali work 	before me I shall write in Harijan. But I know nothing about 	the legal argument which, of course, you will get properly examined 	by the Advocate-General and other lawyers expert in the matter and, 	if the legal argument is against you, naturally you will resile from 	the position taken up by you.But I take it that you had the legal 	position carefully examined before you took the plunge.  	But apart from the question of establishing new mills or expan- ding 	the old ones, how is the scheme progressing? Have you already made 	the commencement? How are the people concerned taking it? Is the 	legislature overwhelmingly with you? I am in such an inaccessible 	place that I get very few newspapers and they are local ones. I, 	therefore, know very little of what is going on outside Noakhali. 	Therefore Noakhali at present is my world and it is large enough for 	me.  	Please keep me informed of what is going on about the scheme and do 	not hesitate to make concrete suggestions if you expect me to do 	anything concrete.  Yours,  BAPU  From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers.

SRIRAMPUR,
  December 5, 1946 A special 	messenger from the District Magistrate, Comilla, delivered your 	packet containing your two letters dated 2nd and 3rd instant 	respectively. I am glad that you are going to issue some such  	statement as suggested by me. In these days of fear, sometimes not 	without ground and sometimes groundless, no contradiction should be 	superfluous, much less appear foolish.   If 		“some mischievous 		Hindu young 		men have 		been throwing crackers 		and missiles 		at Muharrum 		processions”, I would 		suggest that they 		should be 		brought to book.  I 		note that you 		have devoted 		a considerable 		portion of your 		letter of 		the 2nd December 		and the whole 		of the 		3rd December to 		Bihar, and 		you have repeated the 		advice you 		have given me 		often enough 		that my 		place is 		rather in 		Bihar than in 		Noakhali. If 		I find any 		confirmation of 		the most 		serious statements made by 		you about 		Bihar, I confess that I have egregiously blundered by resuming normal diet.libtech_238_footnoteBut I am loath 		to reject 		the testimony 		of Pandit 		Jawaharlal Nehru, then 		of Dr. 		Rajendra Prasad, 		both responsible men 		and persons who 		had gone 		specially for 		the purpose 		of seeing 		things for themselves 		andallaying mob 		fury. They 		admit that 		the behaviour 		of the 		Hindu crowds 		was bad enough 		in all 		conscience but 		they do not 		bear out the statements 		made in 		your letter. Nor 		do they 		uphold the figure 		given by 		you. They also tell me 		that mob 		fury has 		subsided and 		that the 		Government have 		regained control undoubtedly with the 		assistance of 		the military. 		If I 		could feel that my 		presence was 		at all 		necessary in 		Bihar, I assure 		you that 		I would 		not need 		any encouragement 		from you 		to do so. 		On the 		contrary, my 		informants assure 		me that my presence is 		not required 		in Bihar. 		In these 		circumstances, unless I 		feel sure 		of my ground, 		I know 		that I must 		go to Bihar. 		But I 		would like to 		make the assurance 		doubly sure and with 		that end in view 		I would 		be glad 		to get 		your permission to 		send copies of 		your letters to 		the Prime 		Minister of 		Bihar and 		know his 		reaction. There 		too you will 		pardon me, 		will you 		not, for 		not taking your 		statements as 		gospel truth. For 		one thing, you have no first-hand knowledge of events. I suggest that     
 there should be an impartial commission, appointed with the consent of the two Governments, to go into the disturbances both in Noakhali and Bihar.libtech_239_footnotelibtech_240_footnoteIf your statements are true and the callous behaviour of the Bihar Government, which you so graphically describe, can be sustained, it is a bad day for the Bihar Government, a bad day for the Hindus and good-bye to restoration of friendly relations between the two communities, and it would be a serious question for  me  to consider where I stand. The least I can permit myself to say is that then I should have no hesitation in publicily denouncing the Bihar Ministers and Bihar Hindus. I would plead with you to suspend, if you at all can, final judgment in the matter.
  Now 	I come 	to Noakhali. 	I sent 	you a 	longish letter yesterday 	and I asked 	Satis Babu to arrange 	for its quickest 	delivery through a 	special messenger. I 	tried even 	to see if there was possibility of sending 	it by air 	but I failed. 	You have 	painted a 	rosy picture of 	things in 	Noakhali. I 	wish I 	could share your 	estimate. I 	have formed no 	judgment. I 	have passed 	on to you 	the purport of 	much of 	what is handed to 	me in writing and 	what is 	given to 	me by word of 	mouth. If 	the information imparted 	to me is correct, 	things are not safe 	enough in 	Noakhali. Hindus 	have not shed 	their fear and from 	what you say 	even the Muslims 	are not free from it. My 	business in 	coming here 	is not 	to sow or promote 	dissensions between the 	two. I 	regard myself, as 	 I have 	ever been, an equal 	friend of both. 	I know 	that through no fault 	of which 	I am 	conscious I 	have lost caste in the Muslim League 	circles. No 	Muslim friend has 	yet been able to 	tell me 	what I 	have done 	to deserve 	that fate. 	I am in Noakhali 	to be judged 	by my 	conduct. My 	non-violence is 	at stake. Bear with me whilst I am groping. 	I am 	the same person 	as I 	was when we 	met in 	Faridpur and later in 	Deshbandhu’s house 	after his death. This 	much is enough 	for time being. 
     [PS.]  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI   Wish you 	could show me a quicker way of reaching my letters

 DEAR AGATHA,
 Ramakrishna Bajaj has sent me your welcome letter. Carl Heath did write to me and I wrote to him at once. I have no doubt he will share that letter with you. I, therefore, say no more about the subject matter of the letter, important though it is.
 Here I am in an inaccessible part of Bengal and dealing with the most difficult part of my mission in life. I have never been in such darkness as I am in today. And the darkness does not come from outside. It is due to my limitations. My faith in ahimsa has never burned brighter and yet I feel that there is something wanting in my technique of it that I feel as though I were on an unbeaten track.
 As you must have known, my fast has blown over just now. Bihar is quiet and I am therefore trying to take the usual diet though I have still to be cautious. I hope soon to get  over  the  physical weakness which was inevitable with no-protein and no-starch and no- fat diet. The most satisfactory thing about this reduced diet was that I was able to do full amount of mental work and a fair amount even of physical work.
 If this letter reaches while Amrit is still in Europe, please tell her that I have received all her letters but I have written none to her purposely, feeling that she was soon to return and there was every danger of my letters missing her, especially as I am in an out-of-the- way place where there is no post office worth the name and no telegraph office at all. Naturally I am not in touch with what is going on in Delhi. If my mission succeeds here I shall be fit enough for further work. Anyway, so far as I know, I have to bury myself here till mutual confidence and friendship between the communities are restored. What happens here will happen throughout India, because Bengal is the nerve centre.
Love.

 CHI. NARANDAS,
 Your letter calls for a reply. I have resumed my normal food. Hence there is no cause at all now for worry. Really speaking worry has no place in a thoughtful life. The present mission is the most complicated of all I have undertaken in my life.“I cannot see my path in the thick darkness of the night, take this your child under your protecting care. Light up the path of my life.”I can sing these lineslibtech_242_footnotewith perfect truth. I do not remember to have experienced such darkness in my life ever before, and the night seems long. My only consolation is that I have not accepted defeat or given way to despair. His will be done.
 I mean to do or die here.“To do” means to restore amity between Hindus and Muslims; or I should perish in the attempt. This is difficult to achieve. But it will be as God wills.
 All the co-workers have offered themselves up in this sacrifice of their own accord, but if they repent, they are free to leave. They have been posted, each in one village, with a Bengali interpreter to help him or her. Kanaiyo also is away from me as a part of this plan, and so is Abha.
 I am camping in an unfortunate village in  the  interior. Parasuram, who cannot be posted alone because of the language difficulty, is with me. He is a silent worker and an expert stenogr- apher. The other is a Bengali professor. Both give me perso-nal services, too. Most of the others are at a distance of ten miles from me. They can come and see me whenever it is necessary. Pyarelal, Sushila Nayyar and Sushila Pai also are camping in different villages. Kanaiyo had fever for one day. He is better now. There is no cause for worry. He himself is quite cheerful. He leads the Ramdhun and remains fearless. God has blessed him with fine health. Abha is perfectly safe. She has gone with Bapa. She is in a village sixteen miles away. Kanaiyo preferred this arrangement. Bapa has taken great interest in her and is pleased with her spirit of service. She makes rotlis
 
 
 for him and, being a Bengali, works among Bengali women. She was not happy to be separated from me, but dharma dictated that course and so I sent her away. I had also started regarding her services as a necessity. However, in this difficult sadhana of mine, how can  I afford to make a habit of getting service from others? You will now see that every step taken is being dictated by dharma. Everybody there should rejoice at what is happening. I have now written enough. You should go on with your work.

 December 5, 1946
 Put yourself in Mr. Suhrawardy’s shoes; do you think he would favour it, or even the Muslim residents of Noakhali? For it would be interpreted as a preparation for war. But if you believe that this is the only workable scheme, you can go ahead with it.
For myself, the path is different. I have become a Bengali to
 
 all intents and purposes. Today Nirmal Babu is my ears and is indisp- ensable, but when I learn enough Bengali, he will be free to go.
 Then he explained his own plan—how he had already posted one worker in each village, with a Bengali interpreter where necessary, in order to “steal the hearts of the inhabitants”. It did not matter if there was only one or many Hindus in a village; his prescription was that they should stick to their posts and even face death, if necessary, with courage and willingness. If they lived in clusters, it would really mean accepting the Muslim League’s mischievous two-nation theory. Then he added : If there has to be migration at all, it must be complete. I am not
going to be a willing party to Pakistan. Even if I fail to prevent it and
 all Hindus go away, I shall still remain here; and shall not make a single change in my religious practice.
 Nirmal Babu remarked that no one had taken to this advice so far, as the scheme was beyond the strength of the average individual. Gandhiji replied :
If some could die like this, the few shall become many. I am
 not a visionary as I am generally supposed to be.  I am an idealist, but   I claim to be a practical idealist. I have been born a Hindu and I shall die a Hindu, a sanatanist Hindu. If there is salvation for me, it must  be as a Hindu. Hinduism absorbs the best in other religions, and there is scope for expansion in it.
 Nirmal Babu thanked him for his kindness in thus taking up the cause of Bengal. Gandhiji immediately replied that it was no kindness and if it was, it was kindness to himself. He said :
 My own doctrine was failing. I don’t want to die a failure but as
 a successful man. But it may be that I may die a failure.

I got your letter of December 2 today as also Rajendra Babu’s.
 What you have written is reasonable, but I feel that this resistance to evil is not honest. My point is that the whole game is lost if we resort to the law of the jungle. One may react to violence by counter- violence, but that counter-violence can be either brutal or civilized and effective. What happened in Bihar was brutal and ineffective and so was the case in Garhmukteshwar. In such matters the precedents from Mahabharata and Bhagavata can mislead us. Our life, that is, the ways of our people should become thoughtful and orderly. My effort
 is in this direction, the result is in the hands of God. I am not writing to Rajendra Babu separately. Please do not worry about my health. I take good care of it."

  December 	6, 1946  Gandhiji 	began his after-prayer speech by saying that true prayer never went 	unanswered. It did not mean that every little thing we asked for 	from God was readily given to us. It was only when we shed our 	selfishness with conscious effort and approached God in true 	humility that our prayers found a response.  In 	the Ashram prayer nothing was asked. The prayer was for God to make 	them better men and women. If the prayer came truly from the heart, 	God’s grace would surely descend upon them. There was not a blade 	of grass which moved without his will, not one single true thought 	which did not leave a mark on character. It was good, therefore, to 	develop the daily habit of prayer.

  December 	7, 1946  Gandhiji 	referred in his few words to a writing by a Mussalman. In it the 	writer had rightly contended that a man of God was never afraid to 	die or to lose his possessions for the sake of his self-respect or 	religion. God had given us life and could take it away. That 	teaching was universal and applied to all, Hindus as well as 	Mussalmans. Those who had in God their sole refuge cast out all 	fear. Then there could be lasting friendship between the two. He had 	been trying all these days to din this lesson into the ears of his 	listeners. There was a time when Mussalmans also listened to him; 	but now things seemed to have changed and even among Hindus there 	were not many who would follow his advice. But he felt sure lasting 	peace could come only when men of whatever community refused to 	surrender to any fear save the holy fear of God.  Harijan, 	5-1-1947   "

 I have your postcard. I think your way of service has changed. You cannot now undertake the risks involved in the work here. The task here is a difficult one. Your duty is to live with Kanchan and make her perfectly happy. That is your swadharma. I see your spiritual progress only through her happiness. Whatever happens will be for the good. You are doing right in supervising the construction of the hospital buildings. Take similar interest in the other activities there and do them well. In whatever you do you should have Kanchan’s fullest mental co-operation. Physical co-operation  she  does give, willingly or unwillingly. But work is true karma only when both body and mind co-operate. This is nothing to be ashamed of. On the contrary, that is the right way to live and only those who live in this way make any progress.
 He who curbs the organs of action but allows the mind to dwell on the sense objects, such a one, wholly deluded—is called a hypocrite.
Reflect over this verselibtech_253_footnotelibtech_254_footnoteand rejoice.  Kanchan should write to me

The better course would be for you to stay in Sevagram, to get well and do as much service there as you can.

 It is a matter for regret that Chi. Sharda is still not getting well. She is now impatient to go to you. If you need her, it is her duty to go and it is our duty as her elders to send her. But I believe that as long as she remains ill she will not be of any help to you. If you wish  to have her near you in the hope that that will benefit her health, I would count it as your ignorance. From the point of view both of climate and other facilities, Sevagram is the right place for Sharda. I am keen that she should first get well and then go to you and help you. If she has patience, with God’s grace she is bound to get well. Since she has not lost any weight, we can certainly hope for improvement. By and by the fever is bound to go. Notwithstanding what I think, however, ultimately, what you wish will be done.

  December 8, 1946 Gandhiji said that a friend had sent him a book containing the sayings of Prophet Mohammed. He read the book whenever he could snatch a few minutes’ time.  Today 	he tried to select something out of the book for them. Both Hindu 	and Muslim  friends 	were assembled there and these sayings were such that both ought to 	practice what they learnt from them.  If 	men lived according to these precepts, then there would be an end to 	all       
 quarrels. They should be able to live as good neighbours in spite of differences of opinion and of religious belief. He would now present them with the translation of two sayings. The first was this in the original book by Abdullah Almamun Alshua Nawardy: “Actions will be judged according to intentions.”
 The second was: “Man is an unbeliever unless he desireth for his brother that which he desireth for himself.”

165,"December 9, 1946","INTERVIEW  TO 
DEOBHANKARlibtech_268_footnote","
    
 December 9, 1946
 When Deobhankar asked him as to how the Muslim masses could be won over and unified under the Congress and if this could not be achieved best through some form of economic struggle along class lines, Gandhiji replied that so far such a plan had not succeeded in respect of the people whose communal sentiment had proved too strong. What we had to do was to prevent the Congress from turning into a Hindu communal organization. Anyone who had made India his home should be protected by the Congress. Hindus should never think that Hindustan belonged exclusively to them. The Parsis had come centuries ago, and the Syrian Christians were Christians ever since the time of St. Thomas. Every one of them had to be treated as an Indian enjoying the same rights as any other Indian.
 Congressmen should not however approach Muslims in a  spirit  of appeasement or flattery. Although something like that had been done, and it might even be justifiably said that he himself had partly been responsible for such an attitude, yet, his eyes were now opened and he held that it had been unwise to do so. It was by safeguarding every person’s legitimate interests that Congressmen could prove their genuine love of nationalism. He did not mind even if the Congress were manned by Hindus alone. If its members placed the cause of the whole nation above everything else, then their idealism would ultimately triumph over communalism.
 What the Hindus or Mussalmans had exhibited so far in Bengal or Bihar was violence mixed with cowardice; there was no element of bravery in it. To those who did not believe in non-violence, he could hypothetically suggest a more civilized form of revenge than what they had actually been guilty of. Supposing there were a Government in Bihar which believed in violence and not in non-violence, they could have written to the Government in Bengal after the Calcutta riots, ‘Now, here are the inhabitants of this province who have returned from Calcutta. They have become
 
 furious and are bent upon taking revenge on the 14 per cent of Mussalmans in Bihar. But we will prevent them from doing so, if we can. In the meanwhile, you should do everything to stop the riot which is even now going on in Bengal.’
 Along with sending such a letter to the Muslim League Government in Bengal, the Government of Bihar should have kept the Muslims of Bihar informed about their efforts. If conditions in Bengal did not improve, they could have notified the Bengal Government that unless the Bihar Muslims left the province for Bengal within, say, eight days, they would have to send the latter forcibly over to Bengal rather than allow them to be butchered in Bihar. And when the eight days had passed, they might have taken necessary steps for evacuating the Muslims of Bihar.
 It was quite likely that the Muslims of Bihar would have refused to move and declared that they were with the Congress rather than with the League in the policy that the latter had been pursuing in Bengal. That would have meant a victory for the Congress not only in Bihar but in all those provinces where the Government was run by the Congress.
 Such action, though fully violent, would have been better than that to which Bihar had lowered herself today. Violence, when cowardly, only served to degrade and did not yield the desired political result.
 Gandhiji lastly said that today he was seeking for a  non-violent solution for   his   own  sake   alone.	For  the  time  being,  he   had   given   up   searching for a non-violent remedy applicable to the masses. He had yet to see if non-violence would prove successful in the present crisis or not. He expected that things would take a definite turn one way or the other within two months and not remain uncertain as they were at the present moment.

  December 	10, 1946  If 	Hindus and 	Muslims in 	India gathered courage 	and cast 	from their hearts the 	fear of 	loss of 	possessions and 	life the face of India 	would change in 	no time, Gandhiji 	said. But the reformed social relations must be based upon character 	built on  the rock of fearlessness; only thus could true mutual 	trust be generated. He referred to  the 	saying of 	Prophet Mohammed 	quoted on 	Sunday last   and 	 said   that   in 	  every     
 religion there was a common fund of spiritual experience which applied all over the world.
 Whatever differences struck our eyes were the results of requirements limited to particular epochs of time and place. Indeed there were as many religions as there were men on earth; for the needs of no two men were wholly alike. In spite of that, the commonness underlying all the religions could never be missed. A tree had a single stem, many branches and innumerable leaves, no two of which were wholly alike; it was even so in the case of religion.
 No religion today was without blemishes. Islam had given rise to the noblest  of characters and he counted among his friends men who stood tall and high over their neighbours. But unwanted accretions had gathered in the practice of Islam, which ran counter to the fundamental teachings of that religion.
 Similarly, Christian nations, who followed their Master, who taught mankind to love their enemies, had been responsible for two major wars during our generation, which had blighted the face of earth and had left a legacy of suspicion, hatred and violence from which the whole world was suffering today.
 In Hinduism too, diabolical wrong had been perpetrated in the  name  of religion. Our so-called untouchable brethren had been reduced to a condition which was the very opposite of human dignity. Indeed this very charge had been laid against us by General Smuts at the United Nations Assembly in America when Shrimati Vijayalakshmi Pandit demanded justice against the treatment meted out to us in South Africa.
 Gandhiji wound up by saying that both Hindus and Muslims were like blood- brothers. They were nourished by food grown from the same soil, quenched their thirst by water of the same river and finally laid themselves to rest in the same earth.  If they feared God, they would fear no one else.

Businessmen will find their portion and the rest will come easily. But all this can and should be done only if a living, befitting temple is built.
 The whole of the sum will not be spent in stone and mortar. Some marble is necessary. It should be a unique thing. It ought not to contain any idol. An idol is not a necessity of Hindu belief or a Hindu temple. Such a model structure but very artistic has been built in the Harijan Colony, Kingsway, Delhi. You have seen it. The one in the Viswa Vidyalaya grounds will be twenty times larger, with a great dome with proper acoustic properties, to accommodate an unlimited number of people. It will be a striking thing and there should be a daily service conducted there by priests who will show piety in every one of their activities, private and public. If the idea is grasped, the proper persons will come. More I need not say. You can dot the is and cross the ts.
 I have not really the time to spare from the work here before me, but Panditji’s memory is a sacred trust for me. He was much greater than he himself knew. But his limitations were amazing. The wonder is that he surmounted them all.

  	Sucheta is still in Calcutta attending to her ailing sister. I have 	asked her not to hasten so long as in her opinion her presence in 	Calcutta is necessary for her sister. She has not sent me the 	medical certificate but in her letters she says she will hand it to 	me when she comes. You may depend upon my not letting her overdo 	things to the damage of her health.

I am not likely to do so, but I do want to feel that you are at liberty to come at any time you like without notice, if you want to consult me about anything. Personally I would say that you should do as your reason and conscience tell you, irrespective of what I may think or may not think. I am too much engrossed in the work before me to think of anything else, unless a letter like yours moves me.
 Darkness around me still persists. It comes from within,  not from without, but it certainly does not deject or disappoint me. I am passing through a fire such as I have never passed through before. All the same I am quite happy in thought that I am not shirking what I hold to be my duty. God is the Rock of ages and I cling to that Rock.

Your first duty, as I see it from this distance, is to improve your health. Whether you have to stay at Benares for six months or more will be decided by me, and that too after seeing how you fare there. After all you will render some service even at Benares. I am not here entirely unattended. I am being looked after very well. It is Parasuram’s first duty. Besides, Nirmal Babu is also here and he takes great pains. Therefore do not worry about me at all.

 The deputation headed by Shrimati Vijayalakshmi Pandit and sent to the U. N. O. Conference by the Interim Government has undoubtedly done very effective work with marked ability  and success. That is clear from the following cablegram sent by Shrimati Vijayalakshmi Pandit from New York :
 Today with your blessings justice of South African Indian cause was vindicated. Committee voting twenty-four to nineteen in our favour. Went to General Smuts after meeting and shook hands. He expressed appreciation at manner in which I had conducted case.libtech_285_footnote
 It remains now to be seen how the  Parliament  of  the  Union  of South  Africa  and  its  European  public  respond.  Field  Mar-  shal  Smuts  was  able  to  hurl  at  the  Indian  deputation  the  taunt that India treated her so-called untouchables, legally described as the “Scheduled Classes”, much worse than the Union treated her Asiatics or for that matter the Africans. There would be much to be said for
 
 the Field Marshal’s taunt if it was true. It is true of South Africa that her treatment of Asiatics has legally deteriorated from time to time, so much so that it has now become well-nigh unbearable. Almost every promise made by the Union Government to the Government of India has now been broken. In India, on the other hand, there never has been any law carrying the bar sinister against the Scheduled Classes. It can be proved up to the hilt that the law has always sought to protect the Scheduled Classes. There is no legal bar, so far as I am aware, against any of the Scheduled Classes being regarded as equal in status to the tallest Indian. What is however true to the shame of orthodox Hinduism and the Sanatani Hindus is that religious custom has denied to these untouchables the rights which the law has allowed, and it is unfortunately also true that sometimes custom overrides the law. But public opinion is progressively rising against this barbarous custom and it is merely a question of time when the custom will be swept out of existence. Let us, therefore, hope that instead of taking doubtful advantage of the things in India which no one defends and against which public opinion is pro-gressively rising, the Europeans of the Union of South Africa will recog-nize that if the U. N. O. Conference is any index of world opinion, it is decidedly against the European prejudice which has hardened into law.

 Your suggestion is that people of the  same  culture  should  be  brought together   in   a   common   territory   and   placed   under   a   common   government. Of  course,  for  administrative  purposes,  men  have  to  be  divided   into   groups. This  is  best  done  on  economic  grounds  or  on  the  basis  of   linguistic   unity. What Gandhiji objects to is the redistribution of population on the basis of religion. That would mean an admission that people of different faiths cannot live on friendly terms within the same State. The Muslim League has suggested a similar remedy for the present Hindu-Muslim tension, when the minority who remain over in each Province will be  held as  hostages for the good behaviour of  the majority in  the
 
 neighbouring Province. This would amount to an armed truce and not peace on terms of equality, friendship and mutual trust. To cut up India into specifically religious zones, and then redistribute population to fit in with such an artificial scheme would, in Gandhiji’s opinion, be monstrous. For it will cut across many of the linguistic, cultural and fundamental bonds of co-operation which have held together our people in the past.

 December 12, 1946 Gandhiji can only ask an evacuee to return to his house if he can do so with full reliance upon God.  Those who do not feel the necessary confidence in themselves,
 can certainly not be advised to return.
 Gandhiji keenly feels that any word from his mouth cannot bring courage to anyone; and he would not therefore advise any person to return home by relying upon such a frail reed. If one can put faith in God, let him return.

 CHI. JAISUKHLAL,
 I have two letters from you now. The second arrived only  today. Manu had asked for a wire in reply to the first and I had, therefore, wired to say that you could come over and leave Manu with me on condition that she would stay with me till the end.
 I find the second letter in a different strain. If both of you believe that the atmosphere here is impure, how can Manu stay with me ? I can certainly see that nobody harasses her. Whether or not she should talk with Pyarelal will be left to her choice. Just now he is in one village, I in another. If she does not want even to see him, she will  be able to keep that resolve too. But I think that rather than live under such strict discipline it might be better for her to stay in a freer
 
 atmosphere. It would be proper for her to come to me only if she feels perfectly safe with me. Pyarelal’s eyes are clean and he is not likely to force himself on anybody. I don’t think he did anything wrong in placing his idea before me in the presence of all. But we should forget all this now. Manu’s good lies in allowing her to do as she likes, and I want nothing but her own good.
 I did not see the letter addressed to Kanu. It must have gone to him directly. Neither I nor anybody else here knows how it went astray. Here I am the only person knowing Gujarati. I shall know by and by what happened.
 Kanu also is away from me. All the letters are first received by Satis Babu. I don’t know if he sends them to Pyarelal. He comes and sees me once a week at least. I shall know more from him when he comes here next."

They always say: “Lead us from darkness to light, 	from untruth to truth.”  	The Ramdhun has also a story behind it. Once Saint Tulsidas 	was touring on foot different shrines even as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 	had walked to Puri and Brindavan, and reached the temple of Dakore. 	That temple is dedicated to Vishnu.  	Tulsidas said to himself that unless God revealed himself in the 	form of his favourite Rama, his head would not bow in obeisance.  	The story has it that this happened and the devout pilgrim saw 	before him seated in all their glory Rama and Sita surrounded by 	Lakshmana, Shatrughna and Hanuman. Hence the Ramdhun, meaning 	intoxication of God.    
 It is enough if the prayer springs from the heart and leads us from darkness to light and from fear to fearlessness.

 CHI. BHAGWANJI,
 You have asked why the progress of anti-untouchability work is so slow. The reason is plain. The problem has one feature not to be found in any other, namely, that in this case adharma has been assumed to be dharma. It takes time to explain and understand this. Moreover, it requires great tapascharya to convince the people that what is known as dharma is in fact adharma. Those who would do so effectively must themselves be perfect embodiments of dharma. None of us are that. We are full of liking and aversion, yearn for worldly pleasures, lack the capacity to love even our enemies, are without courage and self-control. Who will, therefore, listen to us? This work requires not so much intellectual ability as spiritual strength. If you think over the other items of the constructive programme,  the difference I have explained will become clear to you.
 Please have patience and do your utmost to cultivate the virtues I have mentioned above.

 SRIRAMPUR,
 December 13, 1946 The name Rakshi Dal did not appeal to Gandhiji. Who could pretend to be the “protector” of another?  Each one had to learn the art of self-protection whether it was
 a child of ten, a young girl or a grown-up man. If they felt they could protect themselves and others by means of violence alone, they should learn the art of warfare and the use of arms. But in such an enterprise he could give them little aid. Not only that, it had been his uniform experience that those who set out to protect others with the sword ended by turning oppressors themselves. Under his plan, not many men were needed in a village for the protection of the few against many. One or two would be enough. If they laid down their lives in the performance of their duty without flinching and without anger in their hearts, their example would probably inspire others to exhibit non-violent courage likewise, so that they would either be able to melt the hearts of their oppressors or die in the act of defending their self- respect and honour in a non-violent way. He, therefore, advised the workers to turn themselves into Sevaks or servants rather than “protectors”.

 Gandhiji in his speech said that although hospital work was not in his line, he had respondedlibtech_301_footnotelibtech_302_footnoteto Dr. Das Gupta’s invitation because he was given to understand that
 
 
 the workers were actuated solely by a spirit of service. He knew that the task was a very delicate one today. Refugees had gathered together in camps and it was up to the workers to create an atmosphere when they could safely return to their deserted homes. Moreover, work here was not city work but lay in the villages where insanitation and wretched water supply had to be dealt with.
 Those who read his writings in the Harijan knew that for some time past he had been advocating nature-cure methods. He confessed, this was an old love for him. His experience, as years rolled by, had been that there could be no greater healer than God Himself. It was only when man departed from the laws of Nature as set by Him that he became subject to diseases of body and mind. It was usual for the medical profession to pay heed to the body exclusive of the mind and the spirit. The result was bad. The health of all the three was their supreme concern. Here the chief malady was fear—a feeling which not only benumbed their senses, but also inhibited every attempt to restore conditions of healthy normal living.
 The speaker had heard that Muslim villagers would not go to Hindu doctors. He hoped it was wrong. Medical profession knew no distinction between man and man, no matter to what faith he or she belonged.
 It should be the aim of doctors posted here not to depend on foreign remedies. The countryside was teeming with potent herbs. Ayurvedic and Unani physicians made wide use of them. Why should not doctors with Western learning make use of these cheap remedies? Acharya Profulla Roylibtech_303_footnote, Gandhiji had noticed one day, used plain mustard oil and salt, instead of depending on many oils and pastes turned out by the Bengal Chemical Works. When asked about it, Acharya Roy laughingly replied that those things were meant for simpletons and he was not going to add to their number by using them.

         SRIRAMPUR,  December 	15, 1946  Asked 	 for  guidance  in  regard  to  the  question  of  Grouping,libtech_308_footnoteGandhiji replied : I 	 do  not  need  a  single   minute   to   come   to   a   decision, 	for  	on this I have a mind. I am a Congressman to the very marrow, as I 	am mainly the framer of the constitution of the Congress as it 	stands today. I told Bardoloi that if there is no clear guidance 	from the Congress Committee, Assam should not go into the Sections. 	It should lodge its protest and retire from the Constituent 	Assembly. It will be a kind of satyagraha against the Congress for 	the good of the Congress.  	Rightly or wrongly, the Congress has come to the Decision that it 	will stand by the judgment of the Federal Court. The dice are 	heavily loaded. The decision of the Federal Court will go against 	the Congress interpretation of Grouping as far as I can make out, 	for the simple reason that the Cabinet has got legal advice which 	upholds their decision.  	The Federal Court is the creation of the British. It is a packed 	court. To be consistent, the Congress must abide by its decision        
 whatever it may be. If Assam keeps quiet, it is finished. No one can force Assam to do what it does not want to do. It is autonomous to a large extent today.
 It must become fully independent and autonomous. Whether you have that courage, grit and the gumption, I do not know. You alone can say that. But if you can make that declaration, it will be a fine thing. As soon as the time comes for the Constituent Assembly to go into Sections you will say, “Gentlemen, Assam retires.” For the indepen-dence of India it is the only condition. Each unit must be able to decide and act for itself. I am hoping that in this Assam will lead the way.
 I have the same advice for the Sikhs. But your position is much happier than that of the Sikhs. You are a whole Province. They are a community inside a Province. But I feel every individual has the right to act for himself, just as I have.
 Q. But we are told that the framing of the Constitution for the whole of India cannot be held up for the sake of Assam. Assam cannot be allowed to block the way.
A. There is no need to do that. That is why I say I am in utter
 darkness. Why are not these simple truths evident to all after so many years? If Assam retires, it does not block, but leads the way to India’s independence.
 Q. The British Government has said that the Constitution framed by the Constituent Assembly cannot be imposed on unwilling units. So, if some parts do not accept it, the British Parliament won’t accept it.
 Who 	is the British Government? 	If we think indepen- 
 dence is going to descend on our heads from England or some- where, we are greatly mistaken. It won’t be independence. We will be crushed to atoms. We are fluctuating between independence and helpless dependence. The Cabinet Mission’s plan lies in between.
 If we act rightly, there will be the full blown flower of indepen- dence. If we react wrongly, the blossom will wither away. Mind you, the League standpoint is quite correct. If they stand out, the Constituent Assembly cannot impose its Constitution on an unwilling party. The British Government has no say in the matter one way or the other.
 The British cannot interfere with the working of the Constituent Assembly. Supposing the vast majority, including the Muslims and others form a constitution, you can defy the British Parliament if it seeks to interfere. Power is in your hands. Some such thing happened
 in Ireland only recently. And de Valera is no non-violent fighter. The position of India is far better than that of Ireland. If we have not the penetration, we will lose the advantage we have, as it is apparently being lost today.
 If Assam takes care of itself, the rest of India, will be able to look after itself. What have you got to do with the constitution of the Union Government? You should form your own constitution. That is enough. You have the basis of a constitution all right even now.
 I have never despised the 1935 constitution. It is based on provincial autonomy. It has the capacity for fullest growth, provided the people are worth it. The hill people are with you. Many Muslims are also with you. The remainder can be, too, if you act on the square.
 You will have to forget petty jealousies and rivalries and overcome your weaknesses. Assam has many weaknesses as it has much strength, for I know my Assam.
 ASSAM CONGRESSMEN: With your blessings we can even go outside the Congress and fight.
GANDHIJI: In 1939, when there was the question of giving up the
 Ministry, Subhas Babu opposed it as he thought Assam’s was a special case. I told Bardoloi that there was much in what Subhas Babu had said and, although I was the author of that scheme of boycott, I said Assam should not come out if it did not feel like it. But Assam did come out; it was wrong.
 The Assam Congressmen said that the Maulana Saheb had then said that exception could not be made in the case of Assam.
G.	Here there is no question of exception. Assam rebelled
 and that civilly. But we have that slavish mentality. We look to the Congress and then feel that if we do not follow it slavishly, something will go wrong with it. I have said that not only a Province but even an individual can rebel against the Congress and by doing so save it, assuming that he is in the right. I have done so myself. Congress has not attained the present stature without much travail.
 I remember in 1918, I think, there was the Provincial Confer- ence of the Congress workers of Gujarat at Ahmedabad. The late Abbas Tyabjee was in the chair. All the old guards were there. The Ali Brothers had not yet joined hands with me fully then, as they did later on. The late Shri Vithalbhai Patel was there, and I moved the non-co-operation resolution. I was a nonentity then. A constitutional question arose. Could a Provincial Conference anticipate the decision
 of the Congress? I said, “Yes.” A Provincial Conference and even a single individual could anticipate the Congress for its own benefit. In spite of opposition of the old hands, the resolution was carried. That paved the way for the Congress to pass a similar resolution at Calcutta. India was dumbfounded at the audacity of a Provincial Conference passing the revolutionary resolution.
 We had formed a Satyagraha Sabha outside the Congress. It was joined by Hornimanlibtech_309_footnotelibtech_310_footnote,  Sarojini Devilibtech_311_footnotelibtech_312_footnote,  Shankarlallibtech_313_footnotelibtech_314_footnote,  Umar Sobhani and Vallabhbhai. I was ill. The Rowlatt Act was passed. I shook with rage. I said to the Sardar I could do nothing unless he helped me. Sardar was willing. And the rest you know. It was rebellion, but a healthy one. We celebrate the 6th of April to the 13th. You have all these historical instances before you.
 I have given you all this time to steel your hearts, to give you courage. If you do not act correctly and now, Assam will be finished. Tell Bardoloi I do not feel the least uneasiness. My mind is made up. Assam must not lose its soul. It must uphold it against the whole world. Else I will say that Assam had only manikins and no men. It is an impertinent suggestion that Bengal should dominate Assam in any way.
 Asked if they could tell the people that they had rebelled against the Congress with Gandhiji’s blessings, Gandhiji said :
Talk of God’s blessings. They are much richer. Tell the people
even if Gandhiji tries to dissuade us, we won’t listen.

 SRIRAMPUR,
 December 16, 1946
The chief duty of a servant of a village is purification.
 Today the villages are a festering sore upon the countryside. It is no use blaming the British Government for all our ills. The latter are going to quit India and we have already got a Government mannedlibtech_319_footnotelibtech_320_footnoteby our own people.
 When the British first established themselves firmly in India their idea was to build cities where all rich people would gravitate and help them in exploiting the countryside. These cities were made partially beautiful; service of all kinds were made available to their inhabitants while the millions of villagers were left rotting in hopeless ignorance and misery.
 Now  that  we  have  a  Government manned  by  our  own people let it not be said that they also care for the city people at the expense of the villagers. There is a saying in Gujarati: ‘Dawn is whenever one wakes up.’ Let it be so with us.
 Let the popular Government in the Provinces, whether Congress or League, wake up to the urgency of renovating India’s rural life.
 But this can never be the work of the Government alone; every citizen has to take his due share in public work before we can become  a great nation.
 Gandhiji then drew the attention of local workers to the pitiable condition of the villages. Clean drinking water was nowhere available, roads were in miserable condition, while the canals were choked up by water hyacinth. Every village seemed to have more than its share of dysentery, cholera and smallpox, all of which were preventable diseases. There were plenty of men of bad character who took every opportunity of fishing in troubled water for personal gain.
Purification of this dreadful double disease of mind and body is
 a task to which workers should address themselves. India  is  not lacking in manpower; what is necessary is collective effort rightly directed. Government can do much but they can only do so if there is enlightened public opinion behind them.   Men are now living  like
 
 worms in villages. Darkness will give way only to patient and persevering endeavour. Bad men will then no longer find the environment in which they can grow or thrive. Harmonious relations will be restored among communities when poverty and ignorance  have disappeared.
 It was with that object Gandhiji said that he had come to Noakhali. He could not leave the place until his task was done. He did not mind laying down his life in that attempt.

 SRIRAMPUR,
 December 16, 1946 Mahatma Gandhi, making his first reference to the Constituent Assembly, mentioned the resolutionlibtech_321_footnotelibtech_322_footnotemoved by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru at the Constituent
 Assembly defining the objectives which the Constituent Assembly should have. Gandhiji said that the resolution was placed by the mover after mature consideration of every aspect of the complicated issue facing the country and with due regard to justice to all communities.
 Gandhiji was sure that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru would stick to that resolution, whatever be the criticism advanced or opinion held by others.
 Gandhiji also referred to Pandit Nehru’s recent visit to London where he had gone and from where he had returned not happily. This taught the lesson that we should make our decision after careful deliberation and having full regard to truth and justice and then stick to that decision, whatever the consequences. Gandhiji said that he felt that he must stay on here until the situation had completely improved. His determination was inflexible, whatever other people might say or feel about it. In this connection, Gandhiji cited the story of an artist who had painted a picture. The artist placed it at a road corner and invited opinion on his work. Later the artist found that his picture had been marked in every place with remarks of disapproval. But this, Gandhiji continued, should not be taken by the artist in the light that his work was really not good. What one thinks best one should pursue. One should know what the wise say and see what the saints practise and then one should search one’s own heart whether it wants that thing. One should accept immediately what others might say or do. One must look to one’s own conscience and see if one is prepared for it.
 Therefore, Gandhiji’s advice to people was not to return to their homes simply because he asked them to do so. They should know what the wise men say, what the saints do and also what was in their own mind or heart.

 SRIRAMPUR,
 December 17, 1946 In my opinion, it will be a grave mistake if the Constituent Assembly attempts, in the face of the boycott by the Muslim League,
to frame a  constitution for  the   whole of  India.	If   and  when the
 Muslim League boycott becomes an established fact, the Constituent Assembly should have a right to frame a constitution of independence for all the Provinces, States and units that may be represented at the Constituent Assembly. This will be an honourable and consistent position for the Constituent Assembly as it is at present constituted. There should be no fear of another or for that matter more constituent assemblies sitting, if the attitude advised by me is taken up. No other such constituent assembly can sit or function except under the aegis of the British Government whilst the latter functions in India. If the British Government wills it, such other constituent assemblies cannot [be] prevented except through a terrible struggle put up by the Congress, whether of a violent or non-violent nature.
 I feel too that the Congress can subscribe to the contention of the British Government about Grouping if it allows Assam and the Frontier Province to secede from the Congress for the purposes of the Constituent Assembly. The Congress has no power save the moral to compel obedience by a Province or a group such as Sikhs.

 Gandhiji is very anxious on your account, and wishes to learn everything about the present course of treatment, and also if there has been any improvement in your condition.
 He says further that it would not do for you to fall ill like this. When one has taken upon himself the responsibility of serving the country’s cause, one has also to master the art of keeping oneself in a workable and healthy condition. However heavy the burden of duties may be, the daily routine for maintaining the body in good order must never be broken. Otherwise one’s work is likely to be interrupted.

            DEAR 	ASAF ALI,          SRIRAMPUR,  December 	17, 1946 
  	You are an old and seasoned Congressman. I know how you stood in the 	estimation of the late lamented Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khan and Dr. 	Ansari and what value Maulana Abul Kalam Azad puts upon you, not to 	mention the many important Hindu and other friends you have. It is 	well therefore that the Interim Government of India has chosen you 	as its first Ambassador in America. India has a right toexpect you 	to represent the combined culture India’s  many religions 	represent. What is perhaps more, you will represent simple living 	and high thinking for which the National Congress stands, and of 	which you are a distinguished member.  Yours 	sincerely,  M. K. G.  From 	a copy: Asaf Ali Papers. Courtesy: Aruna Asaf Ali   "
206,"December 	17, 1946",LETTER TO PYARELAL,"
         CHI. 	PYARELAL,       December 	17, 1946 
 I 	have your strange letter.  	Whatever was important, you have settled while leaving. I know I 	cannot change your decision. I am not able to see my mistake. If I 	have made a mistake, it is your duty to point it out to me; and if 	you cannot do it, that is, if you cannot convince me, then you 	should follow my rule. If you are clear to the last moment, then 	there is no doubt that you should leave me. Now you may act and act 	quickly in the light of what you consider your duty. I have informed 	you that for me this is my severest test. If I do not do or die you 	must think me worthless. Then you may take it that my life is a 	burden. 
 You write that my confession was such a heavy punishment for Sushila that compared to that her keeping away without notice should be considered real mercy. This I cannot swallow. If that is so, then what I did  in the case of Ba, my father and many other dear ones should be considered a mistake, is that not so ? Surely you do not wish to say that I made a mistake only in this case ?
 You also realize that if I make mistake again and having committed it, do not  publicly correct it, there is no hope of success  in my present work. Hence, I can do nothing else.
 Though I may make a mistake and proclaim it to the world, yet the heaviest punishment is  borne by one at  whose cost the mistake  is made ! ! ! How can that be so ? Is there not something very wrong  in this line of thinking ?
Suppose that A who is innocent is assaulted and abused by
  Then 	B repents 	and makes 	a public 	apology. In thus 	purifying himself 	B  will  have  proved  guilty  and  yet  A  will  suffer,  is  that  	so? That 	A’s love 	may cause 	anguish to 	 him  is 	 an other matter. 	 Such anguish 	is only 	for the good. 
 If you consider B’s confession proper, there is no difference between him and me. Even if A is not innocent, B, who adheres to non-violence will not be proved innocent because by  his  own yardstick he has definitely been guilty. And anyone who has accepted my moral standard will say that it would be only proper that A also makes a public confession of his guilt.
 Now, in deference to both of you, I have taken the only course possible for me. I have not mentioned anything in the diary. I do not give as much importance to my diary as you do.
 Sushila of course insists that everything may as well be known to the public. But here insistence has no value because she says it out of anguish. She does not regard it as a duty. That is why I have not sent the note I had written to Nirmal Babu. I have torn it up. I have written to Sushila that her duty is to follow your advice; when you and I say different things, in my opinion she should do what you say. Now I have said everything that needs to be said. You may do what you consider proper.
 Sushila is very deeply wounded. I have tried my utmost  to  pacify her. It may be good if you remain with her for the time being. I wish you would go to the village and stay with her. Both of you should together consider and decide what your duty is. The task this
 
 time is extremely delicate.
 I have written all this after careful deliberation. This is the first thing I did after the morning prayer. Before this I wrote a postcard about Sriramulu and the first few sentences in the diary.
 I must keep a copy of this, but probably you will not wish it copied in the diary. So you may return this to me or a copy of it.

  December 	17, 1946  Gandhiji told the audience that it was for the first time today that he could visit      
 that placelibtech_331_footnoteto hold his prayers. God willing, he would like to tour such affected villages one by one. He had not the strength in him to undertake that big task now. For that strength he depended on God. He would like to hold his prayers wherever he goes during his village-to-village tour.libtech_332_footnote
 Explaining further the object of his present mission, Gandhiji said that the task of rehabilitation of refugees had still to be undertaken and it remained an uphill one. He was glad that volunteers from far off places were coming forward to lend a helping hand and mentioned Sardar Niranjan Singh Gill and Sardar Jivan Singh, both of Azad Hind Fouj, who had met and expressed their desire to place their services at his disposal. Gandhiji said that both had met the Bengal Premier before coming to Noakhali and had been promised full support in their mission of assisting speedy rehabilitation.
 Introducing Sardar Jivan Singh to the prayer audience, Gandhiji said that detailed plans of their work had been worked out by Sardars Jivan Singh and Niranjan Singh Gill and would be placed before Bengal Premier. Gandhiji was glad that members of the small Sikh community in far off Punjab considered that the problem facing East Bengal was an all-India problem and that no part of the country could afford to remain indifferent to happenings in other parts. This was a correct example which every one should emulate. Gandhiji was particularly glad that these bold Sikh soldiers who joined the Azad Hind Fouj and fought had now come without even their kirpanslibtech_333_footnoteto work non-violently for the promotion of communal harmony. This perhaps explained the futility of violence in contrast to the efficacy and potentiality of non-violence.
 Introducing Mr. Asaf Ali, Member of the Interim Government, to the prayer gathering, Gandhiji observed :
We are on the threshold of freedom. But we must not forget
that we have not yet attained full freedom.
 Gandhiji said that the Interim Government thought it desirable to have a representative in America for the purpose of interpreting India to the American people and Mr. Asaf Ali had been chosen to hold that high office and fulfil the mission entrusted to him. Referring to the Railway Portfolio now held by Mr. Asaf Ali, Gandhiji said that the immediate problem which should engage the serious attention of the Railway Member was to improve travelling facilities for the third-
 
 
 class passengers and abolish the unhealthy system of supplying Hindu pani libtech_334_footnoteand Muslim pani in railway stations.
 Gandhiji  then  referred  to  his  anger  which  had  overcome  him   on   Mon- day night.libtech_335_footnotelibtech_336_footnoteHe did not have even proper rest  that night, but  from  half-past- two  at  night  he  began his  work.  In   this   connection   Gandhiji   related   how once his father was angry when Gandhiji went to see a theatre. But his angry father did not say anything to him. Instead, he (his father) began to weep and beat his head. Similarly, he at the time of his anger that night began to beat his own head. But he did not like to weep like others. Instead he wanted to unburden his heavy heart by placing before the whole world what mistake he had committed by being angry. For he knew that a man of ‘ahimsa’ like him should not be angry. But he tried his best to suppress his own anger, but so far he had not completely succeeded. He said :libtech_337_footnote
I am not a Mahatma; I am an alpatma. I am an ordinary mortal
 like you all and I am strenuously trying to practise ahimsa. Today I lost my temper and, therefore, I am not a perfect man. If an imperfect man like me can try to practise ahimsa, all of you also can do so. I have come here with the determination to put my ahimsa to test and in that process either succeed or perish.
 He said that every personal act had to be dominated by truth and non-violence if they were to be evidenced in big things. These were not wooden things but living organisms. He felt that he had not attained the necessary stage of detachment described in the Gita.
 He asked his hearers to discard the thought that what one man could do was not possible for all human beings even if a persistent attempt was made. It was simple wisdom to remember that man’s vocation was to make the attempt and God’s grace alone could bless it with success.

 SRIRAMPUR, NOAKHALI,
    MY 	DEAR RANGA libtech_341_footnote,  December 	18, 1946 
  	I have your letter of the 11th instant and the enclosures. You ask 	me not to wade through the latter but ask my Secretary to go through 	them and bring to my notice the most important things. You do not 	know what I am doing and where I am staying. If you did, you would 	not have dictated that letter, but I see that you are too busy to 	look at the daily papers or my poor doings in this part of the 	world. Well, I am in an out-of-the way village hamlet where many 	dwellings have been burnt down and the contents looted. I have 	deprived myself of secretarial assistance. I have a Bengali 	professor who has elected to become my interpreter and teacher and 	even gives me massage, etc. Parasuram of Malabar is with me by 	accident, and as he came to me as an expert short-hand writer and 	typist I make occasional use of him for taking down letters such as 	this. But generally he is in the charge of everything pertaining to 	my personal wants and I am sorry to confess that this business is so 	taxing and exacting that it takes the bulk of his time. But he is an 	uncomplaining, tireless worker, and as he had not had the 	opportunity of coming in personal touch with me during the two years 	he has been with me, he loves the work that he is doing now and I 	love him. Other fellow-workers have been distributed at the peril of 	their lives in various burnt and looted villages in the attempt to 	bring the two warring elements together and  bring,  if human effort 	can, peace to this unhappy portion of India. I confess that it is 	not the only unhappy portion of India, but Destiny chose it for 	putting me or rather my ahimsa and truth on their trial and here am 	I undergoing that stiff but self-imposed test. Therefore, you see 	that either I must myself wade through your papers or neglect them 	for the time being. But I dare not take the second course for the 	reason that I invited the task, and I must not complain. I am half 	through the long documents. It is deeply human and interesting and 	for the love I have towards you I will like to give much more than 	cursory attention to the papers you have prepared with such    
 elaboration.
 As so many trustworthy servants of the nation are up against you, I wish to suggest that you should, for the time being, neglect me and go your way honestly and therefore fearlessly, reposing the fullest trust in your honesty rather than on friends like me of doubtful value because of their national preoccupations and limited capacity for grasping and understanding facts, figures and statements. I however promise that I shall pursue such inquiry as I can during the moments that I can snatch from my present work, and if I can say anything useful I shall write to you. You on your part will not hesitate to give me all the facts you can.

  December 	19, 1946   As 		to the National 		Flag, my opinion 		is that 		whilst we 		are part 		of the 		British Dominions it 		is but right and 		proper that 		in the Ambassador’s 		office in America 		the Union 		Jack is 		flown side 		by side 		with the National 		Flag. In view 		of the 		Muslim League revolt, I 		would go 		so far 		as to question 		the prudence 		of flying 		in America 		 the Congress 		flag as 		our National 		Flag. But 		it is a 		ticklish question and 		you should 		ask, on this 		and the other 		questions, for the 		instructions of 		the Interim 		Government, not 		merely of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Every 		Ambassador carries 		written instructions within which he  is  bound 		to act. 		These he 		can neither 		diminish nor extend.  As 		to the second, 		India as she 		is at present 		cannot omit the 		Union Jack in 		foreign countries. Take instructions.  As 		to the third, there is 		a new British National 		Anthem, omitting 		all the objectionable 		words. I 		have no 		doubt that what was      communicated 	to them the following instructions from Gandhiji.”  
 done in England only recently can be safely done by the Indian Ambassador in America. Whether we can sing Vandemataram or Jai Hind or the Tricolour song at the same time should be decided by the Interim Government.
  The 	Ambassador’s speeches 	where audiences 	are purely 	or predominatly 	Indian should be in 	Hindustani first and 	he can 	translate the 	same into English 	whenever occasion 	requires it. 	For pure American 	audiences speeches should be 	only in 	English. It 	would be 	pompous and unreal 	to deliver 	before American 	audiences speeches first 	in Hindustani 	and then 	translations in English. 
 It should be remembered that the most polished Ambassadors have read their speeches which they have prepared or have been prepared for them in advance.

 SRIRAMPUR, NOAKHALI,
 
    DEAR 	FRIEND,  December 	20, 1946 
  	I wrote to you three letters–one dated 3-12-46libtech_352_footnoteon the general situation, a second dated 4-12-46 	regarding Sardar Bahadur Sir Datar Singh’s suggestion and a third 	in reply to your letters of 2nd and 3rd December.libtech_353_footnoteI am sorry that all the letters have remained 	unanswered. I can only ascribe to heavy pressure on you the absence 	of any communication from you.  	I took the liberty of sending to Abdulla Saheb three complaints 	which had come under my notice—one of very recent murder, another 	of rape and third of loot. He was good enough to call on me 	yesterday and to tell me the result of his investigation which he 	was good enough to hold very promptly. The first one he said was 	true as to the event itself but not sustained about the culprits 	named. I believe the guilty parties are being traced. The second has 	been found by him to be a concoction. The third is found to be true 	and is being pursued.     
 For me the relevance for the purpose of this letter lies in the fact that the trouble is not over and the fear is not wholly without foundation. Indeed, complaints have been almost daily coming to me showing how difficult the problem is. If you can possibly regard me as a well- wisher of your Ministry and of the Muslim League, you will please continue as you began to let at least one Minister to be on the spot and keep himself in touch with me. If this expectation is too great or cannot be fulfilled, you will please tell me whether you approve of my keeping in touch with the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police to whom I could directly refer the matters which come under my notice and which I consider to be worthy of being put before them.
     [PS.]  Yours sincerely,  M. K. GANDHI    	Just as I  was about to sign this, two messengers from  Comilla "

     CHI. 	KAKA,  December 	20, 1946 
  	Your letter of the 6th arrived at Kazirkhil on the 12th. It seems to 	have been given to me on the 16th. I  have  been  meaning  to  reply 	to it every day since then, but could manage to dictate this only 	now at 5.15 (local time) after the morning prayer. I am so helpless 	at present.  	I am dictating this to Manu who arrived  from  Mahuwa yesterday. I 	wished to write the letter myself, but could not do that. I have 	been awake since 2.30 this morning. I have, therefore, been 	dictating letters lying in bed. I have just left the bed to drink 	warm water and honey. After that I shall lie down again. On careful 	reflection I feel that you are inclined now, on Mavalankar’s 	persu- 
 asion, to join the new Universitylibtech_354_footnote.  By  all  means  do  so.   I  have   no doubt at all that you will adorn whatever work you take up.
 But I will blame you if there is the slightest slackening in Hindustani work. I will not then accept the reply that you joined the University with my consent. I should like you to join the University with this understanding. But you must know that your headquarters will necessarily be at Wardha. You should also tell Mavalankar that Sardar and other Gujaratis should agree to your  joining  the University. It will be enough if you inform him to that effect.
 Your shield will be Dadalibtech_355_footnotelibtech_356_footnote.  I could not follow your definition of “residential”. I have understood the word merely to mean that colleges and other institutions outside the University area should not be placed within its jurisdiction. For instance, the Aligarh University. Any student may join such a university, but there will be no affiliated colleges. Why does Dada insist that the Committee should have only Gujaratis as members? You are regarded as a Gujarati, and so is Mavalankar. But suppose it were not so; according to me it would be narrowmindedness then, if, on that ground, you could not be elected. If the U. P. or Bihar were to reject Kripalani as being a Sindhi, would it not be an illustration of  the  dog-in-the-manger  attitude?  One cannot oneself eat but would not let others eat. If, therefore, it is considered necessary to add a fifth qualification to the fourth mentioned, I would suggest this: Nobody will be appointed a member of this Committee merely because of his status or to please  him, though any such person who possesses the other qualifications for passing the test will be accepted.
 I understand about Narahari and Kishorelal. See that the latter does nothing at the cost of his health. I would describe my health as excellent. The climate here wholly agrees with me.
 Bisenlibtech_357_footnoteis working with Satis Babu. The latter had sent him today to me for my final decision. I had a long and frank talk with him. I have also understood what kind of a man he is. I will now think and decide in a day or two where to post him.

225,"December 20, 1946","INTERVIEW  TO  RAYMOND
		 CARTIERlibtech_360_footnote","
    
 December 20, 1946
 As soon as the French gentleman entered the room Gandhiji greeted him in French “Comment allez vous?”libtech_361_footnoteAnd then added with a loud laughter that he had exhausted his entire stock of French !libtech_362_footnote
 The visitor was surprised and was all smiles on hearing Gandhiji greeting him in French.
 Gandhiji then told him that he had learnt some French in his school days. Gandhiji then referred to Victor Hugo and said that he could still picture before his mind “Jean Valjean” crawling through the lanes of Paris.
 Gandhiji then told Cartier that he had been to Paris thrice and had on every occasion wanted to stay in the quarters inhabited by the poor. It was surprising, he said, that the first city of the world in regard to fashion, luxury and certain other things should have miserable slums lying in the heart of the city.
 On being asked by Cartier as to what Gandhiji thought about the present condition of Europe, Gandhiji said that people of Europe were talking of peace but harboured war in their hearts. Unless they shed violence from their hearts, it was not possible for them to have peace.
 When the last war began, Gandhiji said, he had felt that unless Europe changed its ways this war would only be a prelude to a third and more disastrous war.libtech_363_footnote
 Raymond Cartier asked: “We who are children of violence in Europe, how do you expect us to become non-violent?”
 In reply, Gandhiji said that if they continued like this, they were sure to perish. What had happened in Europe was that Hitlerism had only been destroyed by super-Hitlerism and this chain was endless. It would go on like that.
 Raymond Cartier asked if the remedy lay in a new form of education.
 Gandhiji said that education must be of a new type for the sake of the creation of a new world. He referred to Aldous Huxleylibtech_364_footnote, who, he observed, represented a new type of thought which was working in the mind of Europe today. It might be in a minority today but if Europe was to save itself from suicide, something along the lines of non-violence had to be adopted.
 Asked as to how it would be possible to destroy Hitlerism by non-violence, Gandhiji said that was what we had to find out. Otherwise, if one depended upon superior violence in order to destroy violence of the Hitlerism type, then small nations would have hardly any chance of survival. It was only when a nation individually refused to be beaten by Hitlerism or any combination of forces of violence, and stuck to its post at the cost of its life, but not at the cost of its honour, that it had a chance of survival. So, non-violence was the only guarantee  of protection against the heaviest odds. Unless we could develop this courage and this type of resistance, democracy could never survive.libtech_365_footnote
 Cartier next asked, how France could have at all survived if it had not defended itself against the Nazi hordes.
 Gandhiji replied that for that matter even the Maginot Line had not availed them much. Hitler had reduced it to nothingness.
 Cartier said that the fault lay not in the principle; it was a  technical flaw   in the Maginot Line to which military strategists attributed its collapse. Gandhiji rejoined :
Maybe; but beyond that there is a deeper flaw which is funda-
 mental to the whole philosophy of the Maginot Line. Unless you can better Hitler in violence, you cannot gain victory. But the moment you
 
 do that, it is Hitlerism that wins and the whole plan of eradicating violence by superior violence is reduced to futility. It is by non- violence alone that you can vanquish Hitlerism or any other species of violence. If I were a Parisian and the Germans invaded my city, I would stir up the Parisians, so that they would lay down their lives to the last man in the defence of their city, not as they did in the last war, but by showing that higher type of courage which the conquest of violence by non-violence calls for. That is what I am trying to evolve in Noakhali. How far I shall succeed, I do not know.
 Lastly, Gandhiji again referred to the works of Victor Hugo and to two of his books, namely, Les Miserables and Ninety-three and recalled the story of the clergyman’s son who represented the type of courage to which Gandhiji was referring.

If, despite that, she insists on cooking her own food, she may do so on condition that that should throw no additional burden of work on the Ashram.

 should not increase.
 I hope Pushpa will settle down. The news of Rajnikant’s expected arrival is alarming. But when there is a rent in the sky itself, how can we stitch a patch on it? It is possible that that relation is perfectly pure. But the father at any rate must be informed, and his consent obtained. Read my letter to Pushpa.
 We may do whatever is possible for Sharda and then stop worrying. What is fated will happen.
 Now about myself. You should give up the hope of my return, or early return there, as also of that of the other co-workers. The task here is a difficult one. I am being tested. Is the weapon of satyagraha  of my conception really a weapon of the strong or only of the weak? It is, therefore, my firm resolve to accomplish my mission here or to lay down my life in the attempt. What is true of me applies to most of the other co-workers as well. It is with this idea in my mind that I have come and camped in a ruined village. God will do as He wills. All the letters will be received there. From here I will attend to the minimum of outside work.

 BHAI KRISHNA SINHA,
 I wrote a letter to you but have not received a reply. Possibly it was lost. It does happen to some of my letters.
 I have received a copy of the Bihar Provincial [Muslim] League’s report. You too must have received a copy. I am therefore not sending it to you. It is a terrible thing if even half of what is stated were true. It even mentions that I should ask the Bihar Ministry for a full clarification of the massacre for which they were  responsible. And if one has been already issued, I may be sent a copy. I should like to take you even further than that. I read in some newspaper that the Bihar Ministry does not propose to hold any inquirylibtech_374_footnotelibtech_375_footnote.  I was sorry
 
 
 to note it. I want the ministries of both the provinces to hold an impartial inquiry by a joint committee to probe the incidents in both the provinces. Even if Bengal does not co-operate, it is the Bihar Ministry’s duty to hold such an enquiry. It will be good if you can also let me know the true condition at present. What is the truth in the report that many Muslims have left Bihar and many are still leaving? There is also a complaint that representatives of the Muslim League are not even allowed to visit the Muslim refugee camps set up by the Bihar Government. I am sending a copy of this to Rajendra Babu.

 SRIRAMPUR,
 December 21, 1946
 Gandhiji began by saying that he held very strong views on the question of charity. It was wrong both to accept as well as to offer anyone a free gift. In our land irreligion often masqueraded in the name of religion. India was said to have a contingent of 56 lakhs of religious mendicants, not many of whom could be  considered worthy in any sense. Even the hateful custom of untouchability had been given sanction of religion in this land of sorrow.
 The problem of relief and rehabilitation, Gandhiji went to say, had become a serious one. People from all over India were eager to help the afflicted inhabitants of Noakhali with money or free gifts of all kinds, and there was a chance that the latter might slip into a mentality of willing dependence on public charity. This had to be combated as much as the complacence of those who might feel they were acquiring religious merit through charitable gifts.
 Referring to the attitude which the Government should exercise with regard  to the refugees in comparison with that held by public charitable bodies, Gandhiji proceeded to explain that it was true that people had gathered in the refugee camps for no fault of theirs. Their homes had been burnt and they were without shelter; others  had   been   robbed   of   all   their   belongings   although   their   cottages might still  be  standing,  while  a  third  group  had  deserted  their homes mainly from a feeling of insecurity. It should be the object of the Government to  deal with each case on its merits and help the people to return home with a feeling of security.
 
 
 Before necessary conditions were created, it would not be right for the authorities to stop rations unless the evacuees went back home with their whole families. If the evacuees were expected to brave hardships and perhaps even death in order to reinstate themselves in their homes, then there would be no need of a state; it would be a condition of enlightened anarchy where every man would be able to protect himself by his own strength in the face of the greatest danger. But as things stood today, much of the necessary work of social service had to be conducted by Governmental organizations.
 Adequate  protection  had  to  be  given  and  an  atmosphere created  where   the people might once more pursue their life’s work in peace. So long as the conditions were not forthcoming, arrangements for relief had to continue.
 But the case of public charitable societies stood on an entirely different footing. Gandhiji held it was wrong for any man to live on public doles. While the South African satyagraha was going on, large sums of money were donated to cover the expenses of the satyagrahis. The Tolstoy Farm near Lawley in the Transvaal was established to accommodate the families and dependents of satyagrahis who worked to the best of their ability for their upkeep. Consequently, the satyagraha organization was able to refund large sums of money at the end of the campaign.
 In accordance with the same principles, the charitable institutions now working here should plainly tell the people that everyone should deem it a dishonour to eat a single meal without honest labour. If we could shed the aversion to labour and adapt ourselves to unexpected changes of fortune, we would go a long way towards the acquisition of fearlessness and thus towards an upliftment of our national character.
 He would venture to tell the refugees that whether they were poor or rich, they should say to the authorities that they would consider it below human dignity to accept doles from the Government. Poor or rich had nothing left to them. Therefore, they were in need of food, clothing, shelter and medical assistance. Therefore, they had a claim upon the State for providing these vital necessities of life. But they would be robbing society if they accepted this aid without each healthy man, woman, boy or girl, labouring to the extent of his or her ability and therefore he would like the Government to provide such useful work for society which they were capable of doing.

233,"December 	22,  1946",LETTER TO H. S. SUHRAWARDY,"
          SRIRAMPUR, 
       DEAR 	FRIEND,  NOAKHALI, DISTT.,  December 	22,  1946 
  	I sent you yesterday by way of postscript a mere ackn- owledgment of 	your letter of 15th instant which came in as mine was going for 	despatch. I observe that Bihar is still on your brain and that    
 you are evidently so worried by the many cares of office that you have not taken the trouble to read my letter carefully, for you have quoted me from memory which has proved a false friend even to men of genius rightly proud of their memory. If you don’t mind, let me assist  you  by  quoting  the  relevant  portion   from   my   letter   of 5th instant referred to by you.
 If I find any confirmation of the most serious statements made by you about Bihar, I confess that I have egregiously blundered by resuming normal diet. But I am loath to reject the testimony of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, then of Dr. Rajendra Prasad, both responsible men and persons who had gone specially for the purpose of seeing things for themselves and allaying mob fury. They admit that the behaviour of the Hindu crowds was bad enough in all consience but they do not bear out the statements made in your letter nor do they uphold the figures given by you. They also tell me that mob fury has subsided and that the Government have regained control undoubtedly with the assistance of the military. If I could feel that my presence was at all necessary in Bihar, I assure you that I would not need any encouragement from you to do so. On the contrary, my informants assure me that my presence is not required in Bihar. In these circumstances, unless I feel sure of my ground, I know that I must not go to Bihar. But I would like to make the assurance doubly sure and with that end in view I would be glad to get your permission to send copies of your letters to the Prime Minsiter of Bihar and know his reaction. There too you will pardon me, will you not, for not taking your statements as gospel truth. For one thing, you have no first-hand knowledge of events. I suggest that there should be impartial commission, appointed with the consent of the two Govern- ments, to go into the distrubances both in Noakhali and Bihar. If your statements are true and the callous behaviour of the Bihar Government, which you so graphically describe, can be sustained, it is a bad day for the Bihar Government, a bad day for Hindus and good-bye to restoration of friendly relations between the two communities, and it would be a serious question for me to consider where I stand. The least I can permit myself to say is that then I should have no hesitation in publicly denouncing the Bihar Ministers and Bihar Hindus. I  would plead with you to suspend, if you at all can, final judgment in
 the matter. To this, which I hold is a full and frank statement of my position, you were good enough to reply :
 I was a little bit taken aback to read in your letter that having heard something from Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Babu Rajendra Prasad you thought that nothing had taken place in Bihar to justify your presence there.
I hope that the juxtaposition of the two quotations is enough to
 demonstrate to you the wholly unwarranted inference drawn by you. But if you still maintain in the correctness of your inference I shall gladly endeavour to demonstrate the unwarranted nature of your inference.
Further, you say :
 I do not know . . . whether they said that there had been no murders, loot, massacre, rape, abduction, conversion or cruelties of unimaginable bestiality and brutishness.
I  suppose, in support of this charge you have the report  issued
 by the Bihar Provincial Muslim League, of which you have been good enough to send me a copy. In parenthesis, I may say that no other copy was received or  seen  by  me.  Pandit  Jawaharlal  Nehru  and  Dr. Rajendra Prasad admit loot and massacre but they do not admit rape, abduction and conversion in Bihar and if “unimaginable bestiality and brutishness” are used to convey more than has been conveyed by the words preceding, I would like you to instruct me as to the exact implication of the phrase. I had a visit only the other day from Pandit Dhanraj Sharma, M.L.A. (Bihar Congress). I try to get as much information as I can from those who come to me from Bihar. Perhaps, it will interest you to know what he had to say about the charges such as have been made in the Bihar report referred to above. I have read the main parts of that report and I must confess that it is not a balanced document. Its framers have failed to convince the reader of a fair measure of impartiality. Be that as it may, it carries no conviction to me and is in flat contradiction to what all my informants have given me including Pandit Dhanraj, a copy of whose letter I am sending you. The Bihar report confirms the suggestion I have made to you for the appointment of an impartial commission of inquiry. To this suggestion of mine, you have omitted to make any reply. Now that  I  have  got  a  copy  of  the  report  of  the   Bihar  Provincial  .  .  .libtech_378_footnotesuggest  to   them  the   appointement  of  such  a  commission.   I  shall
 
 certainly tell you of the result.
You proceed to say :
 It is true that it is the Muslims who have suffered in Bihar and not Hindus.
And then you insinuate,
 therefore, perhaps, your going to Bihar will not have any effect in re- establishing confidence amongst Muslims but the problems are by no means dissimilar.
 Let me say that I do not regard the Muslims to have less claim on my service or attention. However, I admit that my going to Bihar for the time being will fail to re-establish confidence amongst Muslims. I must not go into the causes at this stage. I cannot help deploring the fact. This distrust is so utterly baseless. I regard myself as an efficient servant of India. Let me tell you, whether you as a late friend and other members of the Muslims League believe me or not, that I am here to regain the lost confidence. Nothing will move me away from Noakhali unless the lost confidence is regained, which will be the case if the Hindus and Muslims in these districts trust one another without needing the presence of the police or the military.
 I observe that insistence on my leaving Noakhali is gathering volume. You also share that feeling. I urge you to show me how my presence offends and ask you to instruct the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police to keep a strict watch on my movements and tell these gentlemen in what way I have been erring. Let me repeat my assurance that I have come here with no intention whatsoever of sowing dissension between the two communities or to prefer the interest of Hindus over that of Muslims. I am doing everything I can to dispel all fear and the spirit of helplessness. I have told you how the fear is still persisting. I do wish that I could support your hope that the process of confidence and rehabilitation is making progress.
 I must say I do not know that dissessions at the centre are widening nor have I the slightest notion that “the Congress has accepted the lead of the great Hindu Mahasabha leader, Mr. Shyama Prasad Mukherji”. Throughout its long career it has never accepted the leadership of anyone who has not been avowedly a whole-hearted Congressman.As to the rest of the points covered by my three letters
 whose receipt has been acknowledged in your letter under reply, I shall await a further and considered reply.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

          CHI. 	PYARELAL,       December 	22, 1946 
  	Sushila’s letter has brought me no peace. I have not the strength 	or desire to argue any more. I wish I could unsay whatever I have 	said by way of arguments. I may not mention her name, speak of her 	or write about her letters that others may see– these are 	conditions impossible for me to fulfil. I therefore do not propose 	to write except in specific public interest.  	But I do think it necessary that for my satisfaction you should 	visit her from time to time and write to her at least one letter 	every day and ask for reply.  	In my opinion either she is out of her senses, or I am. I do not 	notice the symptoms in me. This incident has nothing at all to do 	with what Devdas, etc. wish. I do not wish to turn her away. The 	cause of the friction is that I do not wish to take any service from 	her. I do not see how I can make it my duty to take service from 	her.  	I consider the present spectacle very bad for Manu. I have given my 	soul to protect her and I am still doing it. I wanted to achieve two 	purposes by letting her come: first, she would be in a better 	situation and, secondly, you would be restored to normalcy. But for 	that, I 
 would not have accepted her conditions. When I feel the need I may take service from anybody. But how can anyone wanting to serve lay down conditions ? If your attitude is the same as Sushila’s, you too must consider whether you should continue any relations with me. What personal benefit can you have in remaining with me ? If you continue to be with me under pressure or unwillingly, it will do no good to you or to Sushila or to me. The position which Sushila is maintaining is in my opinion against dharma.
 Why should a personal question of this kind arise at this moment at all ?
 I belive that you can keep nothing secret from Manu. That is what I have understood from you. I have not even liked the note, of which she has no knowledge. As for Sushila you can tell her (Manu) that from sheer helplessness you must withhold things from her. As I have understood you, you have absolutely no reason to hold back anything from her. If you have not understood how I have presented your case to her, ask me, and I shall again try to explain it to you.
 You need not give me a copy of my letter to Sushila, nor of my letter to you. I did express the desire to have copies of both the letters but it is not important.
 You can write or tell Sushila anything you wish out of this letter or the whole of it.

 SRIRAMPUR,
 December 23, 1946 Gandhiji first referred to certain personal letters addressed to him as well as a number of articles or comments published in newspapers in which the opinion had
 been expressed that his continued presence in Noakhali was acting as a deterrent to the restoration of cordial relations between the Hindus and Muslims for his intention was to bring discredit upon the League Ministry in Bengal.
 Two days ago he had tried to refute a rumour that a satyagraha movement of an extensive character was secretly planned by him in Noakhali. He had already said that nothing could be done by him in secret. If recourse were taken to secrecy and falsehood, satyagraha would degenerate into duragraha.
 Today he found it necessary to answer the second charge levelled against him, to which reference had already been made. He would like to proclaim that he had come  to Bengal solely with the object of establishing heart unity between the two communities, who had become estranged from one another. When that object was satisfactorily achieved, there would no longer be any necessity for him to prolong his stay.
 His intention could never be to embarrass the League Government in Bengal, Gandhiji added. On the other hand, his relations with the Ministry, as well as with  the officials, had been very cordial and he had been able to gather the impression that all of them looked with favour upon his peace mission. He had discovered no indication yet of his presence causing embarrassment to anyone. It was open to the Government to ask the Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police to convince him of his error if they were themselves convinced. As yet they had said not a word to that effect. If he felt convinced of any error on his part, he would leave.
 Gandhiji said that he had enough work to do elsewhere which demanded his attention. There was Uruli-Kanchan, the seat of his nature cure experiments, and Sevagram, and there was Delhi again, where he might be of some service. He would love to spare trouble to the leaders who had to come to this out-of-the-way place in order to consult him. But personally he felt convinced that the work undertaken by him here was of the greatest importance for all India. If he succeeded in his present mission, it was bound to have a profound influence on the future of India, and, if he might be permitted to say so, even on the future peace of the world, for it was to be a test of faith in non-violence.
 
 
 
 A copy of the Bihar Provincial Muslim League Report on the Bihar atrocities had been sent to him. He had gone through it with care and had felt that it bristled with over-statements. Nevertheless, he was making inquiries on the basis of the report. It was certainly true that much that had happened in Bihar was brutal enough and deserved the severest condemnation.  The overstatement blurred the gruesomeness  of the reality. He was assured that calm had been restored. It was on that assurance that normal diet was resumed by him.libtech_389_footnote
 The reason why he had not proceeded to Bihar, Gandhiji explained, was that he could exercise his personal influence effectively even from a distance. But if there were any reason to suspect that things still continued in Bihar in the manner  described in the League report and that he had been misled by false assurance of his friends, then his place would surely be in that Province and he might even confess that this might imply that the life in the present body was now over and that there was no longer any room for him in the land of the living.
 But he could not help uttering a word of warning that leaders of public opinion had a serious responsibility. Their word would be believed by the credulous public, and they all knew the tragic consequences. This he said irrespective of whether the leaders belonged to the Congress or the Muslim League.

 MY DEAR SHAHEED,
 I remind you of our pleasant meeting in Faridpur when Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das was still in his physical case. If I remember rightly, you were the only one sitting in front of  me spinning assiduously, though you were unable to pull an even or fine thread. And then, if I remember rightly, when I applied to you some distant adjective of affection, you corrected me by saying that you felt as son to me. I would like to think still that you are the same Shaheed and to feel proud  that  my son  has  become  Chief  Minister  of Bengal. libtech_394_footnote
 I wish you had Bengal on the brain rather than Bihar. Assume the truth of all that has been said in the Bihar provincial Muslim League's reports.         You do not want to satisfy yourself by thanking
 God for Bengal being as bad as Bihar.         You seem to believe the
 stories of Bihar cruelties with  which you have been regaled.        I
 frankly confess to you that these reports do not carry conviction to me. If even 50 per cent of the stories are true, life would become a burden for me.         You should know that though here, I was able to
 affect events in Bihar by my putting myself on protein-and-fat-free diet and by my proposal, if things did not mend, to undertake complete fast.libtech_395_footnote
Though I have not come out publicly, and I hope I shall
 
 never have to do so, things in this part of Bengal are  not  at all  rosy. Fear still dominates the refugees. Refugees ought not to be threatened with stoppage of rations. There are several other humane ways of inducing them to return to their homes. If you really want them to do so, you ought to supply them with proper food, warm clothing and decent  habitation          If you cannot do so, because of
 want of funds or sufficient workers, it would be quite proper and honourable to make that announcement and let philanthropists do the needful. There are workers enough in the country who would respond to the call. You, single-handed, will not be able to cope with the work. And if you really mean the thing, you ought to send a responsible Minister whose sole task would be to attend to this public duty. In this  you will find in me a ready, willing, and, I hope, efficient  helper.libtech_396_footnote

 SRIRAMPUR,
 December 24, 1946 Gandhiji began his speech by saying that complaints had been pouring in that people were unable to shed their fear because persons known to be guilty were freely
 moving about. He said that although this might be true, his advice to them would still be to take courage in both hands and return to their homes. When several persons had complained that the amount offered by the Government for rebuilding was inadequate for the erection of any kind of shelter, he felt sure that the Government which was determined on repatriation would extend their aid to the necessary extent.
 What Gandhiji would personally prefer was that the refugees should be resourceful enough to tide over the present difficulty. He would honour a man who begged nothing for himself nor depended on outside aid for protection. If anyone depended on him for that purpose, he was depending on a broken reed.
 
 
 The only effective protection came from reliance upon internal strength, i. e., on God. Everyone should realize the secret that oppression thrived only when the oppressed submitted to it. If they shed fear from their hearts, nobody would or could oppress them.

 SRIRAMPUR,
 December  25,  1946
 CHI. VALLABHBHAI,
 Your letter addressed to Pyarelal reached me direct yesterday. Pyarelal and all the rest are engrossed in their own duties and are staking their lives. He could, when we were together at one place, write or send you something. He cannot do so now. Your letter went  to Kazirkhil; so Satis Babu forwarded it to me here. Pyarelal does not know about your letter. He comes to see me occasionally and will read it when he comes here next.
 I am dictating this at 3 a.m. I shall have a wash at 4 a.m. and prayers after that. This is the present routine. I shall carry on only if such is God's will. However, there is no need to worry about my health. The body responds to the demands made upon it, but I am being tested. My truth and non-violence are being weighed in  a balance which is much more accurate than any pearl merchant ever used. It is so sensitive as to register the difference of even a hundredth fraction of a hair. Truth and non-violence themselves can never be imperfect. If anything is to be found wanting, it may be I who have constituted myself their representative; if so, I at least hope that God
 
 will take me away and work through some other agent. I am sorry that I cannot myself do the work which Pyarelal used to do for me and I have not yet been able to arrange with the two men who are with me to do it. But both are intelligent. I therefore hope to be able to arrange it. In this, your letter will afford me encouragement. Jaisukhlal left Manu here at her own wish three or four days ago. I allowed her to come and stay with me on her terms, as  she  was prepared to live and die with me if necessary. And now I am dictating this to her, lying with my eyes closed so as to avoid strain.  Suchetalibtech_400_footnotelibtech_401_footnoteis also in the room. She is still asleep and I am dictating this letter in a low voice, lying on the wooden bedstead. The bedstead is of a size on which three persons can easily sleep. I do all my work on it. The telegram you have forwarded to me has no substance. There is no limit to exaggeration here. Not that people exaggerate intentionally; they simply do not know what exaggeration means. The imagination of the people runs riot like the local vegetation which grows like grass on all sides. All around us I find huge coconut and betelnut palms, and a large variety of greens grow in their shade. The rivers are all [big] like the Indus, the Ganges, the Jumna and the Brahmaputra. They empty their waters into the Bay of Bengal. My advice is that if you have not already replied to the correspondent who sent you the telegram, you should ask him to furnish proof for his statements so that the Central Government may try to do something about it though they have no power to interfere in terms of the Constitution. And add: ‘Gandhi is there in your midst and it is impossible that he would not listen to you. But he is an apostle of truth and non-violence and it  is therefore likely that you are disappointed with him. But if he disap- points you, how can we, who were trained under him, hope to satisfy you ? But we shall do what we can.’ Don’t tell anyone that since I am here, he need not bring his problems to you. Tell him that he may write to you nevertheless and that it will be your duty to afford relief to him even by going against me, for that is what I have taught you.
The situation here poses many difficulties and problems. Truth
 is nowhere to be found. Violence masquerades as non- violence and heinous crimes are committed in the name of religion. But truth and non-violence can be tested only in such conditions. I know this and that is why I am here. Do not send for me. If I run away from cowardice that will be my own misfortune; but I do not yet see such a misfortune befalling the country. I am here to do or die. News came
 
 over the radio yesterday that Jawaharlal, Kripalani and  Deo  are coming to have consultations with me. That is good. What is the use of my meeting everyone? However, if anyone among you wants to ask me anything, he is welcome. What I wrotelibtech_402_footnotelibtech_403_footnoteabout Assam was not meant for immediate publication. If you know how it came to be published, please let me know. But rest assured that I am right on that point. I am in the furnace here. I, therefore, am in a good enough position to testify what is happening in it and what the truth is. [Sardar Jivan Singh]libtech_404_footnoteoften comes to me, asks for suggestions and assures me that he will implement them to the letter. I think I can trust him. I had a wire from [Sardar Niranjan Singh]libtech_405_footnotelibtech_406_footnotesaying that he had not been able to win you over. But I did not understand what he actually meant. Tell him this if he is there and if you happen to meet him. And if you have been able to understand what he wants to ask me, let me know.
 You will have seen the report of the Bihar [Muslim] League. I have written to Rajendra Babu about it and have asked him to acquaint all of you with my views.  I have writtenlibtech_407_footnoteto the Chief Minister also.  It is dreadful even if half of it is true. I have no doubt at all that an impartial commission of inquiry, which is above reproach, should be immediately set up. There should not be delay of even a single day. Whatever is true in the allegations must be admitted straight away and the rest should be referred to the commission. Discuss this with your Muslim League colleagues in the Cabinet also. I am in correspo- ndence with Suhrawardy. It is continuing. I will send it all to you when it is completed. Jawahar and others will see what has passed between us so far. If you are not doing so already, please read the summaries of my postprayer speeches which are sent to the newspapers.  Or go through the  cuttings which Manilibtech_408_footnotelibtech_409_footnotemay give you. I know even from here the great pressure under which you  are working, but there are certain things which have got to  be  done despite the pressure. To keep yourself informed of what I say, is one

 How can I say you will be well? I will assume that you are well enough to carry on the work. I am sure you can improve your health.   I would still advise you to send for Dinshawlibtech_410_footnote.   I  have  no doubt that he is a good and a sincere man with an altruistic outlook. What if he is not so efficient? You ask about Sushilalibtech_411_footnote.   I cannot say that she is in very good health. She too is in an inhospitable village and is doing good work. Even a quack is a rarity in these parts; so naturally people make much of someone like her. Do not, therefore, be anxious for any of us here. And when everyone of them is here, ready to die, their falling ill should be of no great concern. If one dies, it is as well; only let the death be pure and earn commendation.

 Manudi suggested to you that you might meet  Shankarlal‘s need from her money which is in your custody. I like the suggestion very much. She deserves to be encouraged in her generosity. Shankarlal, moreover, is not begging for an outright gift. He may even pay some interest. There is, therefore, no risk. And even if the sum is lost, how will it matter ? You can even procure the amount from some other source. But why look for other sources when the best is at hand ?
 Manudi is doing very well. The result is in God's hands. Think over my suggestion concerning you.

  December 	25, 1946  Sailen 	Chatterjee who appeared to Gandhiji more as a fellow-worker in the 	cause of independence than a journalist, asked him whether he would, 	in his post- prayer remarks, say something about Christianity 	because it was Christmas Day and reminded him that he had done some 	such thing on the previous Christmas Day. Gandhiji said he had not 	thought of it though he should have .  He 	said he was thankful for the reminder and he informed the audience 	that he had accepted the suggestion without the slightest 	hesitation. Then he had to think about what he should say. He was 	baffled about his choice for he said that it was almost universally 	realized that everywhere irreligion masqueraded as religion.  Whilst 	he was searching for something apposite for the occasion he thought 	of two beautiful note-books in which Rajkumari had copied out gems 	from the Bible and Christian hymns. Rajkumari had been chosen by 	Pandit Nehru, their Foreign Minister at the Centre, as a member of 	the deputation on behalf of the Government of India to represent it 	in the Educational Conference that was held in Paris. She was a 	member of the ruling family of Kapurthala. Her father would have 	occupied the gadi, 
 but for his being a Christian.
 Rajkumari was proud of being considered a Sikh, a Hindu and a Christian and had chosen to throw in her lot with those who were downtrodden. He would invite the audience to give thought to the best from Christianity which he had selected from Rajkumari's collection. Only a few days ago he commended to their attention two of  the best sayings from Prophet Mohammed.
 He believed in equal regard for all religions. Mere tolerance was not of much value. No religion worth the name stood in need of patronage. It should command respect. He added that Jesus Christ might be looked upon as belonging to Christians only but he really did not belong to any community inasmuch as the lesson that Jesus Christ gave belonged to the whole worldlibtech_414_footnote. So saying, he asked Prof. Nirmal Bose to translate the followinglibtech_415_footnotefrom the New Testament on love, which he preferred to render as ahimsa.

253,"December 26, 1946",ANSWERS TO QUESTIONSlibtech_416_footnote,"
    
 December 26, 1946 QUESTION 1. Would it not be better to have pure joint electorate with reservation of seats, than the half joint and half separate electorate which we have today ?
 ANSWER 1. The answer to your Ist question is yes. Second is very difficult.
 Q. 2. When you speak about the removal of untouchability among Harijans, to whom do you refer ? Which section among us ? For many among us, scheduled people, consider themselves higher than the rest.
 A. 2. I agree with you that the removal of untouchability among the so-called untouchables is more difficult than its removal between caste Hindus and non-caste Hindus, i.e., untouchables.
 Q. 3. Will not our condition truly improve only when Congressmen take up Harijan service in earnest, rather than leave it to the fitful efforts of political adventurers among Scheduled Caste people ?
A. 3. The answer to your 3rd undoubtedly yes.
 Q. 4. Could not men like Sarat Babu, Kiran Babu do something to spread the message
 
 of the Congress among the Scheduled Castes ?
 A. 4. I thing the gentlemen you name have done their best to spread the message. Many others who have more leisure have been doing for a long time the class of work referred to by you.

CHI. MANILAL,
 I got your letter and the supplement. I cannot recollect the letter which you mention, and am not bothering to search for it. Strictly speaking, the suggestion about cows does not fall within the scope of the Trust. You can establish contact with the Goseva Sangh. If you try to do that work, you will not be able to do the work you have undertaken. In attempting an ambitious plan, you may fail in both the tasks like the sadhu who lost both this world and the next.  Or you may undertake the work in consultation with somebody who knows it. The idea of making the Arogyabhavan self-supporting is not a bad one. But if you engage two persons for that work, no work will be done and your plan for starting cultivation will have to be abandoned. The difficulty about money can be met. It is not necessary to employ some persons specially for that purpose. As soon as I know the final decision, I shall be able to find the money. You will of course need a well. Get one sunk. I think you mean a deep well to be sunk at a cost of Rs. 4,000. I am inclined towards a well of that type. Or, we can have the type of water-works constructed by the military and can draw the water in the same way as they do. I think we can get enough water from the water-works built by them. We cannot have a buffalo in the goshala. I have no doubt on this point. If we do not insist on having cows only, you may rest assured that they will die out. And the cow will always be followed by the buffalo. Animal husbandry experts have finally come to this conclusion. I cannot judge about buying the plot belonging to Patangiya. All that I can say is that you may do what you think best.
 
 I think this answers all your questions. It is, therefore, not necessary for you to travel all this distance.
 I am dictating this letter after waking up at three in the morning. I don't have the courage, therefore, to try to write to Dr. Bhagwat, Dhirubhai and others, as it is nearing four o'clock now and I have to start preparing for the prayer. I understand about Dhulia.  If Maganbhai cannot stay there regularly and take active interest in the work of the Trust for a few months in the year at least, there will be no point in making him one of the Trustees. I think I have written to you about this in a previous letter. I will [not], therefore, [write more in this].

It does not 	harm me. Nowadays I have made it a practice to get up at 3 o'clock. 	Yet, I cannot say that I am able to finish the day's work. I don't 	want you to come when Jawaharlal comes. It will be strenuous. Consi- 	dering that you have just recovered from fever you should not strain 	yourself so much. If you go to Delhi fairly late, I hope I shall be 	there when you are there. If this cannot be, I am sure to be there 	during your absence. I wish we could  meet before you went to Delhi. 	 I have had a good deal of talk with Abha who has grown wings. She 	is now prepared to live in a village and has, in consultation with 	Satis Babu, selected Chandigram, which is five miles from here. 	Here, too, she has met a number of Muslim families. She even took me 	to a 
 place in the hope of introducing me to the women who, however, never came out. Abha had her object-lesson. I already knew that the women would not come out but I agreed to go with her because they had made a promise to Abha. Abha spoke to me about the two girls whom you have selected to be sent to the Mahila Ashram. Shantabai also has been consulted. The younger one is to be sent to the Mahila Ashram and the older one to the Balika Ashram. Both will thus have different experiences. I see advantage in it.
 Are you sure you are not being hasty in organizing the people's programme in different places? But for this doubt I have nothing to say on the matter.
 Now, if you agree to my suggestion about Abha, I wouldfurther suggest that you send her soon so that she takes up the work, because [Chandigram] will be my first camp during the tour. She would like to be there before that, and so would I.  If  Malatilibtech_417_footnotehas already arrived there. I have nothing to say. But don't send for her if she does not come for the present."

  December 	26, 1946  Gandhiji 	said that he 	had no 	doubt in 	his mind that the British 	would have to 	quit India.  But if Indians were foolish enough to quarrel among themselves, he could     were reluctant to commit themselves.  This reluctance led him to believe that people  were 	anxious to come and serve in a manner which would attract his 	attention and that such people were not keen on service for the sake 	of service."" 
 very well visualize the destiny of the whole country. India would probably be placed under the United Nations which would mean not one but many masters, and, hence, goodbye to independence.
 He was soon going to make the greatest experiment of his life . That would be perhaps his last experiment. He was not a holder of any Degree—B.A.  or M.A.  But  if he succeeded in the examination he was taking in Noakhali, he would think he had received his highest Degree of life—his M.A. And if he  succeeded  in  this examination of his, he would share all that he achieved together with his Degree with the forty crores of people of this country.libtech_419_footnote
 Continuing, Gandhiji said that the task he had undertaken in Bengal was most serious. Here a community which had been friendly to him previously now looked upon him as its enemy. He was out to prove that he was “a real friend of the Muslims”. So he had chosen for his greatest experiment a place where the Muslims were in a majority.
 For the fulfilment of his mission it would suffice if he toured the countryside alone, and the presence of the workers from outside soliciting his advice and direction raised fresh problems for him instead of assisting him to  solve  the  already complicated task he had undertaken.  Much of the misunderstanding could be removed   if those really keen on serving the people of Noakhali would directly approach the Bengal Ministers with their plan of work and obtain not only  their written permission to carry on their work but also their approval of the plan.
 Gandhiji gave this advice to some doctors who came from Bombay yesterday for rendering medical aid to the refugees in the affected areas. To some people who sent him letters and telegrams offering to come to Noakhali for service, Gandhiji had replied that they could serve the cause by carrying on constructive work around their own places. To those who sought directions as to how best to serve in Noakhali, Gandhiji said that he himself was groping in darkness and a blind man could not be the best guide.

 AHMEDlibtech_420_footnote","
    
 December 27, 1946
 DEAR HAMIDUDDIN SAHEB,
 Nirmal Babu read to me your writing in the Azad of the 14th instant. It staggered me and I asked him kindly to give me its literal translation. If there is any incorrectness, you will please send me your correction. I say it staggered me, because you had left an impression  on me that you had entirely realized my sincerity and my usefulness not merely for the Hindu inhabitants of the district but equally for the Muslim inhabitants. Assuming the accuracy of the translation, your article is an indictment against me. Indeed, most of us were under the impression that while Shamsuddin Saheb was leaving for a few days to meet the Chief Minister, You would be staying behind to continue his work and help the Peace Committees that were just then being formed. But the next day, I learned with sorrow that owing to some affliction of your eyes you had to leave abruptly with Shamsuddin Saheb. What had happened in the meanwhile to warrant what I have called your indictment I do not know. Why do you in common with many advisers advise me to leave Noakhali and go to Bihar or somewhere else?libtech_421_footnote
 I have not come to East Bengal to hold an enquiry. I have come to make my humble contribution to a lasting and heart peace between the two communities. I think that I made this statement during the speeches I had made in your presence. Why then the sudden change betrayed by the article in question ? Do you not think that after the exuberant regard you showed for me, I had the right to expect from you a friendly and personal enquiry from me, to inform me of the change and giving the grounds for the change? Perhaps, on reflection, you will discover in your very article valid reason for my longing to be in Noakhali in preference to Bihar. How can I test the efficacy and soundness of my ahimsa except in a place where even the loudest protestations of trust in my professions can be so short-lived as in your case ?
You are right when you say: ""In Mr.	Gandhi's opinion, the
 
 condition in Noakhali is not yet such that Hindus can shoulder the responsibility of returning to their homes."" I have chapter and verse to show why the Hindu refugees who proved themselves deficient in personal courage are reluctant to go back to their homes. The peace Committees which you left in the process of formation are not in working order.
 The Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries would not return to their work of seeing the Committees doing their duty. I urge you for the sake of the League Ministry in whose efficiency and goodness I am at least as much interested as you ever can be. Believe me, I have not come to East Bengal for the purpose of finding fault with the League. I have come in order to induce it by my conduct to shed its complacency and give solid work for the sake of itself and india. For  I believe that if you and I can produce in Bengal the right atmosphere, the whole of India will follow.
 You say, again :“If he (Gandhi) had issued a statement about the real nature of the happenings, perhaps the atmosphere would have cleared to a large extent. His silence with reference to this matter raises suspicion in the minds of many .” Why this insinuation when the fact stares you in the face that I am not in a position to speak in praise of what has been and is being done on behalf of the Bengal Government? If you will care to study the thing, you will appreciate restraint instead of coaxing me to speak.
 You are again right when you say: “Mr. Gandhi does not wish to leave for Bihar.” But your reasons for reluctance are wholly wrong. My “trusted Bihari followers” have indeed kept me informed of the happenings there. The information they give is wholly contrary to what you believe. In common with all, the Bihar Government deplore the tragic happenings. But they claim that they have acquired control over the turbulent elements and are straining every nerve to give satisfaction to the afflicted.
 It will not serve the cause of peace if I went to Bihar and found the Bihar Muslim League’s report to be largely imaginary and the Bihar Government’s conduct substantially honourable, humane and just. I am not anxious to give them a certificate of good conduct as I am to give you, much though you may not want it. My spare diet and contemplated fast, you know well, were against the Bihar misdoings. I could not take such a step in the matter of Noakhali misdoings. It pains me to think that you, a seasoned lawyer, should not see the
 obvious.
 I assure you that I am not guilty of “importing numberless volunteers from outside to serve his (mine) object”.  In the first place,  I have not imported numberless volunteers. In the second place, my object is not what you have been pleased to insinuate in the same paragraph. Let me tell you that for the fulfilment of my object, I do not need any volunteers here except myself. If you really think that their presence is a menace to the peace of Noakhali, the Government have but to say that they are a danger and to serve a notice on them to quit, and I assure you that without a murmur they would leave this district. From this undertaking, I and one of my company, whose name I need not disclose at this stage, are excepted. You will be astonished to learn that, dear as they are all to me, and valuable as I count their services to the nation, I told them in this mission of mine I had no need to have any associate with me; for the quickest way to fruition required no protection or co-operation save what God sent. Such is my conception of the working of ahimsa. I hope that before the Government takes the adumbrated action they will depute an officer of their choice or trust to find out from me or them the kind of work they are doing. Their life is an open book. There is nothing hidden or underground about their activities.
 Permit me to give you my impression that your writing bristles with unprovable and reckless statements without regard to facts. I have noticed only some of them.
 As it is, my letter has become much longer than I had sketched in my mind but as I proceeded I could not shorten it if I was to give you some conception of my deep grief. If you will know more. I suggest to you that you should take the trouble of coming to me and passing with me half an hour or so and cross-examine me on the charges you have framed against me.
 This letter is not an open letter as yours is. I have written only for you, cherishing the hope that it may perhaps appeal to you as coming from a well-wisher open to conviction.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

Sen           December 	27, 1946  There 	was nothing tangible to be shown yet, but non-violence sometimes 	worked in unexpected ways.  Gandhiji's 	advice to 	the Swamiji 	was that violence 	should be eschewed 	altogether. There should 	not even be 	a trace 	of it among 	the workers 	entrusted with 	organizations. He 	emphasized the 	need for 	constructive work which 	could bring food to the 	hungry millions as 	well as 	anti-untouchability work 	to remove 	the disabilities 	which had crippled the Hindu society to a very large extent.  Hindustan 	Standard, 28-12-1946         SRIRAMPUR,  December 	 27,  1946  Gandhiji 	in his 	address said 	that a 	friend had been telling 	him that 	his referencelibtech_424_footnoteto “darkness” 	surrounding him was very 	confusing to 	many. The 	friend thought 	that people at 	a distance 	saw light 	shimmering through his 	plan, and 	there was enough proof that the confidence was slowly returning in that affected area.      
 Gandhiji said he would tell this friend and others who thought like him that they had misunderstood him to some extent. The darkness in which  he  was surrounded was of a character the like of which had never faced him before. It was indeed now a vital test that his ahimsa was passing through. He would not be able to say that he had come out successful until the object was reached.
 It was true that night was darkest before dawn. He himself felt that and although friends at a distance could see glimpses of the breaking dawn, he himself felt that he was surrounded by complete darkness.
 Gandhiji said that many years ago a friend of his used to carry Patanjali's Yogasutra constantly in his pocket. Although Gandhiji did not know Sanskrit yet  the friend would often come to him to consult about the meaning of some of the sutras. In one of the sutras  it was stated that when ahimsa  had been fully established  it would completely liquidate the forces of enmity and evil in the neighbourhood. Gandhiji felt that the stage had not been reached in the neighbourhood about him and this led him to infer that his ahimsa had not yet succeeded in the present test. That was the reason why he was saying that there was still darkness all round him.libtech_425_footnote
 Referring to a statement of Mr. Suhrawardy, Premier of Bengal, Gandhiji said it seemed to him that he was beginning to see glimpses of light. The Bengal Premier had said that he hoped Mahatma Gandhi's mission would be successful and bring results beneficial not only to Bengal but to the whole of India. The Bengal Premier had also said that he must provide escort to protect Mahatma Gandhi on his walking tour. Gandhiji said that Mr. Suhrawardy had only been doing his duty in offering him protection. He knew that military and police had been posted round about his cottage. He sometimes exchanged greetings with them. Beyond that he thought none could do so if God willed it otherwise.
 Referring to his walking tour Gandhiji said in a couple of days details would be settled. As soon as the programme was ready he would communicate it to the Bengal Premier, for he felt he should do nothing without his knowledge.
 Gandhiji said that his plan was to proceed with the least number of companions on his march, and that he would prefer to stay in the houses of Muslim friends. He had reduced his needs and these could be met even by the poorest villagers. He would like to go absolutely unprotected if it was to prove that in his heart he had nothing but love and friendship for the Muslims.libtech_426_footnote
 Gandhiji said that if he was absolutely alone on his mission his services would have gained considerably in quality. He would also have been able to assess in that case his ability for facing the present problem of Bengal.
 
 Numerous friends had for some years past placed their services unreservedly at Gandhiji 's disposal. When he first came on his mission to Noakhali, he had intended to dispense with the services of those friends. His idea was to place himself absolutely in God's hands. Of course God helped his devotees through human agency but in that case it would come naturally and without his asking.
 If the original plan of coming here alone had been followed to the letter, complaints that were now being made against him would have been neutralized to a large extent. Even now his advice to anyone who wished to serve in Noakhali would be not to seek his advice, far less to depend on his directions.
 Those who would like to come here should instead contact the League Ministry and secure their written permission. Moreover, they should place before the Ministry in detail the nature of work they propose to do and while working here they should confine their activities within that scheme and on no account go beyond it. He was suggesting this course, because it was the League Ministry's authority which  prevailed in this Province.
 Today he was regarded as enemy number one by the League and if people from outside came to help him they were bound to be regarded as helping an enemy. But he was very anxious that this should be avoided.
 There were men and organizations who were of the opinion that Hindus who were numerically weak should learn self-defence in terms of violence. Muslims on the other hand also felt that they could swamp Hindus by means of their overwhelming numbers. But he had no doubt about it that both of them were not only injuring their own communities but also acting against the interests of India as a whole.
 Concluding, Gandhiji prayed to God that he might be successful in cementing differences between the two communities which had unhappily been estranged from one another and said that in this great experiment he would like to march all alone with God as his sole guide.

  December 28, 1946 Introducing Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhiji said that he was one of the two Rashtrapatis 	 present.	Panditji 	occupied the position 	of Vice-President in the     
 Cabinet, where he represented the Indian people. The other, namely, Acharya Kripalani, was now at the head of the Indian National Congress. The former was at the helm by virtue of Government office. The latter had nothing but moral authority. Mr. Shankarrao Deo, the present General Secretary, and Miss Mridula Sarabhai, the outgoing one, were also in their midst. All the four were servants of the Indian National Congress and through it of the nation.
 There were some who described the Congress as a Hindu organization. They only betrayed their ignorance of the political history of India. At one time the Hindu Mahasabha was in the hands of the Congress and so was the Muslim League and others.libtech_432_footnoteCongress was not a Hindu organization. It did not serve Hindu interests to the exclusion of the other communities.
 It was hinted that the Congress leaders had come to consult him with regard to the interests of the Hindus. Had they done so they would have lowered the stature of the Indian National Congress in the eyes of the world. They had come to consult him, as an expert on the Hindu-Muslim question, as to how best to serve the national cause in the present crisis. The reins of Government had come in the hands of the people’s representatives; the nation was well on the way to independence, but it had yet to be achieved. It was sure to come if we made wise use of our strength. The leaders were determined to do without British aid in solving our problems. One single step might injure the national cause.
 On the previous evening, the speaker added, he had saidlibtech_433_footnotesomething about Suhrawardy Saheb. If the people respected democracy, they could not disregard the Ministry. If anyone wished to serve the afflicted people of Bengal then nothing should be done without the knowledge and sanction of the Ministry.
 There should be no mental reservation.
 Gandhiji concluded by saying that he had come to prove by his action that he was a sincere friend and a well-wisher of the Muslims. Restoration of the feeling of amity and brotherhood was his sole concern.

278,,INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE,"
    
 SRIRAMPUR,
 [December 28/30, 1946]libtech_437_footnote
 During its unbroken career of sixty years, the Congress has been invariably and progressively representative of all the communities— Hindus, Muslims and others. It has been also progressively represen- tative of the masses. That it has always had a number of hypocrites is but an ode to these two among its many virtues. If those who repr- esent these two virtues are found to be in a hopeless minority, they should lodge their protest and leave the Congress and influence public opinion from outside. Then only will they be true servants of the nation. Therefore at this critical period I hold it to be necessary for the Working Committee to give the proper, unequivocal lead to the Congress by laying down these propositions :
  It 	is now perhaps 	late to 	cry off 	the Constituent Assembly 	though I 	still hold it 	to be the best course 	to make 	the Congress position 	absolutely clear.  The 	second best 	is to accept 	the Cabinet 	Mission’s statement 	with the joint 	interpretation of it between themselves and Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah.  It 	must be 	clearly understood that 	it is open 	to any 	Congress individual or 	unit to 	declare his 	or Group’s 	or Province’s 	secession from 	the Congress stand which 	the Congress 	should be free 	to accept 	whilst still openly 	guiding the seceding 	elements. This will be 	in accordance with 	the Cabinet’s position 	that they will not 	compel any 	Group or Province. 
 The result of this would be that the members of Section A would prepare a full constitution in terms of the Cabinet Mission’s statement and B and C Sections would have to frame what they can in spite of the seceders, i.e., as at present conceived, Assam in the East and Frontier Province in the West, the Sikhs in the Punjab and may be Baluchistan.
 
 discussion with the leaders, Gandhiji prepared instructions for the Working Committee. This was	handed over to Jawaharlal Nehru and others.”
 It may be that the British Government will recognize or set up another Constituent Assembly. If they do, they will damn themselves for ever. They are bound when a constitution is framed in terms of the Cabinet Mission’s stand to leave the rest to fate, every vestige of British authority being wiped out, British soldiers retiring from India never to return.
 This position of the Congress is in no way to be interpreted as playing completely into Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah’s hand. And if this he considers to be what he meant, the Congress will be thanked by the world for giving Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah a universally acceptable and inoffensive formula for his Pakistan. The Congress dare not shirk the right thing because it completely coincides with his view.
 The constitution will be for whole India. It will have to contain  a specific clause showing in what way it will be open to the boycotters to avail themselves of the constitution.

 SRIRAMPUR,

 CHI. VALLABHBHAI,
 I have your letter. Jawahar and others will be able to tell you about what happened here.
 I hold strong views about. . . . The work being done here cannot be carried on with the Congress funds or funds collected by you. He should collect the money publicly both from Hindus and Muslims. I am also getting more convinced from experience that all activities which are carried on with the help of money alone are sure to fail. You also should give up any idea of getting things done with money. It is essential that . . . should not deviate even an inch from what is agreed to between him and me. I am resolved that I will get out of it as soon as I see even the slightest impurity. This mission is most delicate and the biggest that has fallen to my lot. God has sustained me so far. I wake up and start work at 1.30 a. m., standard time, and there has been no difficulty yet. About tomorrow, God alone knows.
I have heard many complaints against you.libtech_445_footnoteIf  there  is  any
 
 again.	. . .  It is my habit to tell people the bitterest truths.	The remark about
 meeting the sword by the sword has been torn out of a long passage and presented out of context.	If any of my colleagues has complained to you about me, I should like
 to know. None of them has said anything to me.”
 exaggeration in “many”, it is unintended. Your speeches tend to be inflammatory and play to the gallery. You have lost sight of all distinction between violence and non-violence. You are teaching the people to meet violence with violence. You miss no opportunity to insult the Muslim League in season and out of season. If all this is true, it is very harmful. They say you talk about holding on to office. That also is disturbing, if true. Whatever I heard I have passed on to you for you to think over.The times are very critical. If we stray from the straight and narrow path by ever so little, we are done for. The Working Committee does not function harmoniously as it should. Root out corruption; you know how to do it. If you feel like it, send some sensible and reliable person to explain things to me and understand my point of view. There is no need whatever for you to rush down here. You are no longer fit to run about. It is not good that you do not take care of your health.
 I will stop here. It is now 5.35, Calcutta time, and there are heaps of arrears to be disposed of.

  	You certainly should have proper food. A soldier must keep his body 	fit. You must always keep with you roti or biscuits. If you 	take with it some coconut it makes a complete diet. If you add to it 	some gur it will make a complete diet (I have tried all 	this). So, even while being on the march, it can be eaten at fixed 	times. You will have read in the History of [Satyagraha 	in] South Africa that during the march to the 	Transvaal, I ate while walking. If you do this you will never have 	to depend on anyone. You can take whatever fruit is locally 	available.  	You have agreed that you and I should never talk keeping Manu apart. 	You cannot entertain any doubt about her at all. Hence I advise you 	to convey to her the purport of our talk. Show this also to her. 	Then whatever bad feelings she may be having will automatically come 	to the surface. Affection can never last till the end. It certainly 	did not last in this case. Hence you must be cheerful and confident 	and inspire in her as much confidence as possible. Letting her know 	of your doubt will be an act of loyalty. Then you must do whatever 	you can without entertaining any doubt. God belongs to everyone. He 	will do as He wills. I am doing only that. I am having her sleep 	close to me. She sleeps naked but sleeps soundly. She has to be 	woken up whenever there is work, be it at 2 o’clock or 3 o’clock. 	I consider it  a very good sign that she is able to sleep like that. 	I have known it since the Aga Khan Palace days that she is quite 	unself-conscious. The main thing was that she should be with me, in 	my care and associate with you and learn. That has happened. Now we 	must all wish that only what spontaneously occurs to her will 	happen. Only then will she be completely free from fear.  	That you want to conquer is my own expression. You must learn to 	understand my language. The English word ‘conquer’ is ofno use 	to me. I can never utter the word in that sense. The conquest that I 	am talking about has to be achieved by everyone. It is religion. We 	have to conquer untruth by truth, violence by non-violence. How nice 	if you could unlearn English reading and English thought ! What I am 	asking for is that you narrate to Manu all the incidents you have 	mentioned. It would be nice if you could let me know. I should 	follow it better in the written form. This would be an act of 	service to Manu. 
 It would never mean betrayal of her.
 For the present we cannot all three of us hope to be together. What is possible is that when you come, the three of us may occasionally sit together.
 It is not proper that I would keep you with me right now. The present sadhana consists in our being apart. The most glaring example of this is Abha. Abha has risen thereby and I think she will rise still higher. Bapa is happy and looks happy. As we absorb ourselves in our work, God will bring us together. And even if we have to sacrifice ourselves while being apart, no harm will be done. I shall not feel sorry in the least if Amtussalaam passes away while she is fasting. She is brave and it seems what she has done now has been after proper thought.
 I agree that you are missing something by being away from me at this time. But what you are gaining in the process is much greater.
 Hence, you must know that the time of disappointment is now past. I do not think I have anything more to say now.

I came to know 	about the late Vachharaj from Bulsaria. As you say, Panchgani will 	miss him very such. But no institution has the exclusive privilege 	of losing its true workers. God picks up impartially any worker He 	likes. Why, then, grieve over such a death? I have met Vachharaj’s 	wife, but as I do not recollect her name I did not write to her. But 	I     
 have written to Bulsaria. You did well in giving me the information about Vachharaj’s brother. I am not writing to him, either. What purpose will it serve? Send him a copy of this letter. Or do what you think right. To write a letter of condolence will mean observing a customary formality.  I do not wish to do that.  I only want that  both  of them should bring honour to Vachharaj’s memory and wipe the tears of all those in Panchgani who believe themselves widowed; serve them and lighten the burden of their widowhood. The passing away of a man widows not only his wife but all those, whom he was serving, for instance, myself. I, therefore, liked your resolution to make up for the loss yourself.  It is wholly worthy of you.  If Jugatramlibtech_453_footnotelibtech_454_footnotecan spare you without inconvenience and agrees to your leaving, the climate of Panchgani is bound to suit you very well.
 If the sanatorium authorities are fully agreeable and if Jayabehn and Vachharaj’s brother are unable to shoulder the burden of the work and, therefore, desire you to go, I can only say that you should go as early as possible. You should certainly go there if you wish to serve everybody without distinction of caste or creed, irrespective of whether he is poor, of a low caste or a Muslim. The sanatorium should pay you enough to meet your daily needs. I think they should bear that expenditure. You may show this whole letter to the proprietor of the sanatorium or anybody else in charge there.
 I hope that all of you are in good spirits and that you enjoy good health. About the situation here Manu will write in this very letter. If you go, I will be greatly relieved and our enterprise there will shine forth.

 withdraw. Today I feel like Trishanku. Is it really time for me to retire to the Himalayas? Many people have started suggesting this. They say it from ignorance  but  what they say has merit.  Bihar  and Noakhali are of course there. I cannot explain to you all this through the written word. I can do so only when we meet and talk.
 You will admit, won’t you, that Malaviyaji was not a brahmachari. ‘Where is the need for it?’ The ideal has never been realized. It can only be approached. I agree. I am repeating the same thing in what I am writing today for Harijan. This is no matter for faith. Malaviyaji confessed it to me and so did Shraddhanandji. In their later years, they had come very close to me. I affirm that, if I attain to the state of sthitaprajna today, I should certainly live to 125 years. It is not just a matter of faith. It is like two and two making four. It is a different matter that we do not come across such a man. If we attain to that state, it is still possible.
I am not sure, but I may have added at least three pounds.
 What news about Gopa? Has the operation been performed? I have wired that the operation should be undertaken if considered necessary. It is good even if one life can be saved.

 He had suggested that they should be spinners themselves and teach others also to spin.  When there were enough of such people in the village,   there would be  no longer any need for dependence on mill yarn. In this way they could lay the foundation of real independence to the masses.

301,"January 	1, 1947",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
         SRIRAMPUR, 
  January 	1, 1947 Gandhiji 	began by saying that his stay in that village had been amply enriched by the abundance 	of love showered upon him by the members of the  household 	in whose midst he had been living. But God had so designed that he 	had never had the fortune of staying at any one place for a very 	long time. His travels had now been crowded by experiences both 	bitter and sweet. He added that the people were requesting him to 	prolong his stay in this village because they said that they were 	gaining courage by his continued presence in their midst.  As 	a matter of fact both contact and separation were normal parts of a 	man’s life. So the daily prayer of the Ashramites was that God 	should give them strength enough to pass through life’s varying 	experiences in a state of equipoise. Verses from the second chapter 	of the Gita which 	were recited every evening described the characteristics of the man 	who had actually attained that mental state. Its appeal was not to 	men of any particular status or calibre alone, but the lesson was of 	universal significance.  That 	he was 	going to 	leave the 	village of 	Srirampur on 	the following 	morning was 	because his 	duty now 	called him 	away from that place. He 	had now to roam from 	one village to 	another in 	order to 	contact people in 	their homes and 	carry the 	message of 	love and friendship 	to them. 	On other 	occasions, such as 	that of 	Dandi march, he 	had been 	followed by lakhs 	of people, 	but this 	time he would 	be going 	alone. It was 	his heart’s prayer 	that when he left 	any place, 	people should be able 	to say 	of him 	that now one had left them who was their friend and not an enemy.  Today 	was the New Year’s Day for the Christians. It was curious that 	they celebrated this day in India with more enthusiasm than they did 	the coming of Samvat or Hijra era. That was due to their long 	association with the ruling class who were Christians by faith.  But 	as he looked upon all religions as equal, being derived from one 	source, there was no harm in observing the Christian New Year’s 	Day. At first Gandhiji’s idea was that he would give them a 	reading of two choice sayings from Prophet Mohammad. But later he 	changed his mind and thought of presenting portions from Christian 	hymns which had been collected and presented to him by Rajkumari 	Amrit Kaur. 
 There was another matter which had exercised his mind for some time past. Friends, he added were friends only when they helped a person to progress in life. If they discovered any faults in him, it was their clear duty to acquaint him with them so that he might be able to correct himself. But this had to be done in a sweet manner and with a spirit of helpfulness.
 It was the beginning of the New Year and his prayer was that the audience and he might be ushered into it free from impurities of the lower self, and thus rendered fitter instruments of service to a common cause.

You need 	not, if the bowels move naturally. If you feel heaviness in the 	head, use a mud-pack, just as I am lying now with a mud-pack [on the 	eyes]. This cures heaviness of the head. In the same way it would be 	good if you applied a mud- pack on the stomach also. If you feel 	cold, keep a hot-water bottle in the bed. Ramanama, of course, does 	everything, but it should come from the heart. Then nothing else is 	needed.

CHANDIPUR,
  January 	2, 1947  Gandhiji 	said that his mission 	was for the establishment 	of friendship 	between the 	sister communities 	living here and 	not to organize 	any one community 	against the 	rest. So 	far the non-violence 	which had been practised 	was the non-violence 	of the 	weak but 	the new experiment in 	which he 	had been 	engaged here 	was the non- 	violence of the strong. 	If it were to be successful, it should succeed in creating a moral 	atmosphere helpful to 	both the communities 	around him. Only when the 	Hindus and 	Muslims shed 	their fear 	and mutual suspicion 	could real unity 	of heart 	come. There should not be any cause for hostility when their hearts were one.  Referring 	to the task of village reorganization, Gandhiji said that East 	Bengal was a land of gold but unfortunately the life of the people 	was not as it should be. The water in the tanks was so dirty that he 	could not dare even wash his hands in them. The villages were also 	unclean. The rich were growing richer and the poor were getting 	poorer. That was not forced upon them by nature. That was a Satanic 	state of affairs. But although the social arrangements were Satanic, 	individuals were not so. Individuals should raise their organization 	and shape it according to new ideas of equality and comradeship.libtech_470_footnote  Gandhiji 	pointed out that the rule that they were going to establish in India 	in the near future should be free from defects which marked the old 	system. Hindus and Muslims today found themselves estranged from one 	another here, but if both of them devoted themselves to the noble 	task of reorganizing the village life and improving their economic 	conditions through development of their cottage industries, they 	would find themselves working in a common task and unity would grow 	among them.  Workers 	who had been 	sent here by Satis 	Babu, Gandhiji said, had 	faced many 	dangers. Gandhiji’s 	advice to all workers 	was that 	they should shed fear of 	death from 	their hearts and try to 	win over 	those who opposed 	them. In that 	attempt some might die, 	but Gandhiji had the faith 	that however impossible 	it might 	 appear,  the 	oppressor’s heart would 	surely be touched if love and courage from their side was of an 	unfailing character.  To 	workers as well as to villagers Gandhiji would like to say that they 	should render a proper account of every single minute of their life. 	They should devote all their time to selfless service of common 	humanity.  Gandhiji, 	continuing, said that he would personally like to live for 125 	years,     
 not with the help of medicines but by natural ways, in which he would be able to serve the nation and humanity.
 He exhorted the audience to carry on his eighteen-point constructive programme which would be a life-giving influence for the entire countryside.

  	I got both your letters. I have formed a high opinion of Shivabhai. 	If I feel that I shall be staying fairly steadily at one place, I 	shall be able to utilize the services of many persons like him. It 	will be a pleasure to do so. What you sayabout cultivating 	fearlessness may be realistic, but it does not become you. If known 	criminals are going about at large, people must learn to cultivate 	fearlessness. We shall remain mere animals till we digest this 	teaching. Forget about violence and non-violence in this matter. Let 	those who believe in violence use the violence of the brave and die. 	Those who believe in non-violence will be able to demonstrate its 	power only in  situations  like  the present one. By describing the 	non-violence of cowards as genuine non-violence, we bring discredit 	on the latter. It  would  be  more correct to describe it as a 	device of the coward. We learnt the trick and that is why I have 	begun to feel a doubt about myself, whether all that     muttered 	to himself: ‘There must be some serious flaw deep down in me which 	I am unable to discover. . . . Where could I have missed my way? 	There must be something terribly lacking in my ahimsa and faith 	which is responsible for all this.” 
 I have learnt, and taught others to do, is to use a device of the coward. I, therefore, have come here to know the measure of my strength and let myself be tested. I am accompanied by the police, etc., and now some Sikh brothers also have joined. And Nirmal Babu has been here all the time. May it be because of them, I wonder, that I go about with  a show of fearlessness ?
 “That state of mind cannot be affected even in dire circums- tances or at the moment of death.”
 This is what Raychandbhai sang and, at the age of 20 or 21, it became my dream to attain such a state. I can go on in this strain, but, as the saying is, “What need of many words before the wise?”

         CHANDIPUR, 
  [January 3, 1947]libtech_475_footnote  Gandhiji 	said that women should depend on God and on their own strength and 	not on others. They should be more courageous and should have more 	confidence in their own strength. If they were afraid, they would 	fall easy victims to the onslaughts of the miscreants. Indian 	women are not abalas. They are famous for their heroic  	deeds of the past, which they did not achieve with the help of the 	sword, but of character. Even today they can help the nation in many 	ways. They can do some useful work by which they can not only help 	themselves, but also the nation as a whole, thereby taking the 	country nearer her goal.  Gandhiji 	told them that not the men of Noakhali only were responsible for all 	that had happened, but women too were equally responsible. He asked 	them all to be fearless and have faith in God like Draupadi and Sita 	of the past.  Gandhiji 	also asked them to eschew untouchability. He said that if they still 	went on disowning the untouchables, more sorrow was in store for 	them. He asked the audience to invite a Harijan every day to dine 	with them. If they could not do so, they could call a Harijan before 	taking a meal and ask him to touch the drinking water or       
 the food. This, Gandhiji said, would go a long way to cement the gulf created between different classes of people by artificial caste barriers. Unless they did penance for their sins in that way, more calamities and more severe ones would overtake them all.

         CHANDIPUR, 
  January 	3, 1947 Gandhiji 	began by saying that what he had undertaken was comparable to pilgrimage which people 	undertook to places like Kashi or Badrinath. God did not  reside 	in any particular place to the exclusion of another but in the heart 	of man. If one undertook pilgrimage in the right spirit, one would 	grow purer and purer.  What 	did it matter to them, said Gandhiji, if their house had been burnt 	and their properties looted so long as they had the will to face any 	calamity with courage and determination to build up their lives once 	again on their own labour? Refugees should bravely face the reality 	and learn some craft by which they could maintain their families and 	earn their bread.  Gandhiji 	said that those who did 	not labour but 	lived on 	the toil of 	others were 	thieves. No 	man was free 	from obligation of 	voluntary labour 	in order 	to support 	himself. One might feel 	tempted to ask what a few individuals could do. The speaker’s 	answer was 	that if 	40 crores of 	small bits of 	wood were tied together, 	it would 	be enough 	to build 	a bridge 	over which the mightiest 	army could pass. 	Similarly, if 	in India 	40 crores of men developed new bonds of sympathy and mutual help, 	they would be able to build a new life in which every man, woman and child could prosper.  Fear 	of hard work and of sudden calamities being thus removed from their 	hearts, they would march a long way towards freedom. If they could 	shed fear, they would be able to stand up before their assailants.  Gandhiji 	added that the fulfilment 	of his mission 	would come only when those 	who were left behind were 	able to say 	that now they had got rid of 	impurities which 	had been 	corrupting their lives so 	far and would go 	forward to 	rebuild their own 	lives on 	the basis of 	labour courageously and 	joyfully undertaken.

I  am  glad  too   that  Shri  Daniel  Thomaslibtech_480_footnotenever  delivered  the speech attributed to him.  	About the Madras quota spindles I am absolutely clear. If I were the 	Government of Madras as you are and I had the backing of      
 public opinion in the shape of mass opinion I would do this in spite of the manufactured opinion of interested parties and, if the worst happened, I would pay for the spindles of my quota and yet not use them. I regard mill-owners’ and Chamber of Commerce’s opinion to be interested in the sense that they and their supporters have made up their minds that what is good for them is good for the whole of India. It is not a question of honesty and dishonesty, it is a question pure and simple of conflict of ideals. Of course, it is open to these gentlemen to retort that in my sense the opinion of the masses may also be called interested. If such be the argument I would hold that the interest of the masses as conceived by them must prevail over that of the classes. It is conceivable that in certain cases the opinion of the classes may be intrinsically right and that of the masses intrinsically absurd. This to my mind is the crux of democracy. Hence, as the Government, if I am confident about the backing of the masses, I would tell the Centre that my Government would pay damages for breach of contract if that be the legal result. I must serve the masses to the best of my ability.

 If the school wanted his advice, Gandhiji said, he would advise Nai Talim (new education) which gives training in crafts. The aim of education should be to make the students self-supporting.

319,"January 4, 1947","DISCUSSION WITH MEMBERS OF CHANDIPUR- CHANDIRGAON
		GRAM SEVA SANGH libtech_488_footnote","
    
 January 4, 1947
 QUESTION: What should the Sangh do to appease the aggressive mentality of the majority community?
 ANSWER: Appeasement has become a word of bad odour. In no case can there be any appeasement at the cost of honour. Real appeasement is to shed all fear and to do what is right at any cost. Blood for blood is a played-out game and non-violence of the brave is the only real approach to the problem.libtech_489_footnote
 In answer to a question whether the refugees should accept monetary assistance from the Government even if it was quite insufficient for the erection of temporary shelter, Gandhiji said:
 Refugees must honestly find out what they need for the least kind of temporary shelter. If their basic requirements are not covered by the proposed Government grants, they should refuse to  accept them but should still return to their homes even if it meant no cover over their heads. This has to be done in a spirit of sports-manship
 Q. In the course of rehabilitation, should the members of the minority community be lodged together in sufficient numbers for the purpose of safety ?
 A. Such concentration of population is an unthinkable pro- position. It would imply that the whole country would be divided into hostile sections, perhaps enjoying a sort of armed peace. The manly thing to do is for every individual, of whatever sect, whether young or old, to derive protection from his inner strength which comes from
 
 God.
 
 
Asked what arrangements for the safety of the refugees could be made in
  view 	of the fact that miscreants were moving freely in the affected 	areas, Gandhiji said:  	No place in the world today is free from miscreants. So villagers 	should fall back on their own strength for protection. The strength 	which will give them lasting protection is the strength of the 	heart. For those who accepted God as their protector, what did it 	matter if miscreants roamed about? People should do what was right 	for them and leave the rest to God.  His 	immediate advice to the refugees would be that they should brave all 	risks and come back home. It did not matter to him that some might 	suffer in the attempt due to exposure or shortage of supplies, but 	the attempt was still worth while.libtech_490_footnote  Q. 	If Government and private 	relief is stopped, what work can we give to the refugees so that 	they can earn their daily bread?  A. Although personally I 	should be tempted to suggest hand- spinning as a universal 	occupation, I would not necessarily do so in the present case. 	Instead, I would suggest that the workers should find out on the 	basis of detailed local enquiries what occupation could be 	undertaken in each village. And when such information is available, 	I would love to give advice in greater detail. It is certain that 	the work must be done in co-operation.libtech_491_footnote  Gandhiji 	said that there were a 	number of 	tanks in 	this part of 	Bengal but 	he had 	not yet seen a single 	tank sufficiently 	clean to wash 	his hands in. 	This villagers were 	in the 	habit of 	using the 	same tank for 	all purposes without any 	scruple whatsoever. A 	clean water supply was 	the prime necessity of 	life. He 	suggested there 	should be 	natural filters sunk 	near the tanks and also artificial 	filters for corporate 	use. Certain tanks could 	also be reserved 	for drinking 	purposes only. If no 	suggestion was 	found workable, 	tube-wells should be sunk 	in every 	village. A second 	alternative would 	be to have 	filters in each 	household made with a 	number of 	earthen vessels, set 	one over another, some of 	them half-filled with charcoal and sand as was done at some big 	railway stations. The 	third alternative was 	tube-wells. He 	did not favour 	the last 	so much 	as it could 	not be prescribed 	for the rich 	and the poor 	alike. It was, 	however, all right 	as an expedient 	and should 	be resorted 	to at once 	in this 	area. If 	there were 	any difficulties 	with regard  to the 	supply of 	materials, he 	would try 	to help them in 	securing these from the Government.

 KAZIRBAZAR,
  January 	4, 1947 Gandhiji 	began his speech by stating that the two sister communities had become estranged from one 	another today and he was even looked upon as enemy  number 	one by some members of the Muslim community. His object in confining 	himself to Noakhali was to test himself. In all his long life he had 	never harboured enmity against Muslim community. In fact plenty of 	the best years of his life had been spent among Muslim friends in 	South Africa.  Gandhiji 	said that it 	was continually 	being impressed upon him 	that his place was 	no longer 	in this 	Province but 	in Bihar 	where infinitely worse 	things were 	alleged to 	have taken place. The 	audience should be 	aware that he 	had all along 	been in 	correspondence with 	the popular Government in 	Bihar and all influence 	possible was 	being exercised by 	him over that Government 	from here; 	but he 	did not want to 	leave Noakhali 	because his task there 	was of an entirely 	different order. He had 	to prove by 	living among the 	Mussalmans that 	he was 	as much 	their friend as of the 	Hindus or 	any other 	community. This could evidently not 	be done 	from a distance 	or by 	mere word of mouth.  A 	Bihar Minister and several responsible officials who had come to him 	yesterday had placed before him all the facts within their knowledge 	without any reservation. They had admitted that brutal things had 	taken place in the course of one fateful week and that they were 	prepared to bear all justifiable censure passed on them on that 	account.  They 	knew their duty as a 	responsible Government. 	The charge 	of complicity 	or failure 	in doing 	all that was humanly 	possible was denied 	by them 	and they said they 	were prepared to undergo 	any ordeal 	in order 	to prove 	their innocence. They had 	been trying to 	answer the 	charges made by 	the Muslim League against 	them. Gandhiji said he 	would like to 	assure the 	audience that he 	would not 	rest until he 	was satisfied 	personally about the Bihar case and had done all that was humanly possible.  Gandhiji 	thought ‘that the attendance of both Hindus and Muslims at prayer 	meetings was dwindling and one day he would be left without anybody 	to listen to him at all’.libtech_493_footnoteBut he said that 	even then there would be no reason for him to give up     
 his mission in despair. He would then roam from village to village taking his spinning-wheel. With him it was an act of service to God. Such labour undertaken with an unselfish mind would speak for itself among those who were around him. A worker, he said, who travelled from village to village teaching the people how to clean their ponds effectively and teaching them other arts and crafts so as to enrich  the life of the villagers, should be able to make the villagers long for his company rather than shun him.
 Continuing, Gandhiji said that news had just reached him that the evacuees were now returning in fair numbers and the question of rehabilitation was becoming more and more acute. His advice to the evacuees would be that they should brave all hardships and return home quickly. By means of their own labour they must determine  to rebuild their homes as well as their own lives. Government should extend all necessary help and they should be approached by the evacuees. He was aware of the fact that various relief organizations were prepared to help the evacuees with finances and other material assistance. But why should they undertake a task which rightly belonged to the Government set up by the people themselves? If the Government failed to extend it either quickly enough or to a satisfactory extent, then it was for them to say so and seek supplementary aid of public charities in order to rehabilitate the people. But whatever shape these arrangements might take, the evacuees must be prepared to return home in the face of all possible dangers and difficulties.

          CHANDIPUR, 
  January 	5, 1947 I 	have not come here to talk politics.  His 	purpose, Gandhiji said, was not to reduce the influence of the 	Muslim League or to increase that of the Congress, but to speak to 	the people of the little things about their daily life, things 	which, if properly attended to, would change the face of the land 	and create a heaven out of the pitiable conditions in which they 	were all living today.  Bengal, 	said Gandhiji, was 	a land 	full of verdure, 	with plenty of 	water and 	fertile soil. 	Nature had 	showered her 	abundance on 	Bengal, but 	through ignorance, 	the people 	were suffering from 	poverty and disease. 	They appeared 	to be content 	with what little could be 	earned from betel-nut 	and coconut 	gardens and a 	little of 	agriculture. But 	with more knowledge, 	they could increase 	the productivity 	of the 	land many times and 	convert their 	villages into 	cleaner abodes 	of peace 	and pros- 	perity. If 	all the villagers joined 	together, the face 	of the land 	would be changed 	    in  no time.  Referring 	to the evacuees, Gandhiji said that they must come back home and 	face all dangers and difficulties. Anyone who had committed a sin 	should likewise make a clean confession to God, and then depend upon 	God for whatever He might choose to do. Truly religious men who made 	a confession to God did not repeat their errors.  Gandhiji 	said that only in the morning he had visited a house where the owner 	had been assured that if he divulged his secret hoard of gold, his 	life would be spared.     
 But when the man did so, the miscreants killed him and looted the gold. No man is free from sin and his advice to the miscreants would be to come forward and depend on God and live like brave honest men

I came to know about it from      
 Nirmal Babu’s letter afterwards. Manu has lost her equanimity. Kishorelal’s letter has played a great part in it. If instead of worshipping her, you worship God—if it is possible for you do that— then everything will become easy. If you cannot do that, then everything will go awry. Maybe even this yajna will come to nothing. And if that happens I shall be the main culprit, not any of you. But this is all too long to tell. I can see that you will not be able to have Manu as wife. If God wills otherwise, it is another matter. But if you on your own try to accomplish your design, Manu, who is with me, may be lost to you and she will certainly never learn anything from you. But if you pray to God to grant her as your wife, you will be able to have her as a pupil. This is a hard situation. Do what you can. I cannot see anything else.
 Dev will write the rest. It will be good if you share all this with Sushila. Do show her Nirmal Babu’s letter.

I pray to God that 	the tour which I begin tomorrow may be duly completed and  	produce the intended result. All of you should join me in this 	prayer. But before offering the prayer you should know why I have 	undertaken this tour. There is only one purpose behind this tour and 	it is very clear. May God cleanse and purify the hearts of Hindus 	and Muslims and may the people of the two communities give up 	mistrust and fear of each other. All of you should join me in this 	prayer and say that God is our Lord and may He give us success.  	One may ask, where is the need for a tour to achieve this object? 	How can one whose heart is not pure tell others to be pure? How can 	one who lacks courage, inspire courage in others? How can one who is 	himself fully armed, advise others to give up arms? These are all 	relevant questions, and such questions have also been put to  me. 	During this tour I shall try my best to convey to every villager 	that there is no impurity in my heart at all. I can prove all that 	only when I live and move among those who distrust me. The third 	question is difficult to answer because I myself move under police 	protection.     
 Fully armed police and military personnel are with me. They are alert and always respectfully guard me. All this is entirely in the hands of the Government. Our Government is of the view that it is its duty to provide me police protection during my tour. How can I stop this? I can only say that none but God is my protector. I do not know if you will believe me. I am speaking the truth. God alone knows a man’s heart; none else can know it. It is the duty of every believer in God to obey the dictates of his heart. It is my claim that I act in this way. But the Sikhs have not been deputed by the Government.  Can  I  not prevent their accompanying me? You should better know that they are also accompanying me on my tour with the permission of the Government. They have not come here with the intention to fight. They have even left behind their kirpans. They have come here to serve the two communities without any discrimination. The first lesson of the Indian National Army, which Netaji had formed, was that people belonging to all religions, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsis, etc., should regard India as their own country and should all work in such a way as to bring about unity. The Sikhs want to serve both the communities and they wish to do so under my guidance. How can I reject such friends, and why should I? They are serving because they have vowed to serve and not to show off. If I refuse to accept their service, I shall go down in my own estimation and shall prove a coward. It is my request to you that you also should trust  these  brothers of ours and, by treating them as brothers, take advantage of their help. They can help a lot; they have a great deal of experience. God has given them health and honesty.
 If what I have said about them is proved false, they will go away from here; and if I am keeping them here with any evil intention, I shall myself be doomed and the experiment for which I have come here will fail.
 During this tour, I want to teach you a few essential things, as for example, how to get pure water in the villages, how to keep ourselves clean, how best to utilize the soil from which we have sprung, how to breathe in life’s energy from the infinite sky above our head, how to draw fresh life from our surroundings and how best to use the sun’s rays. Our country has become impoverished. I shall try and teach you so that you may, be making proper use of these resources, convert this into a land of gold. I pray to God that during this tour I may succeed in performing such service to you.

 MASIMPUR,
 January 7, 1947
 People should try to purify themselves and their religion from within and not indulge in outward show, said Mahatma Gandhi.
 Replying to a question regarding the wearing of the sacred thread which, the questioner said, the Arya Samaj wanted every Hindu to wear, Gandhiji said that anyone who liked might wear the sacred thread but there should not be any movement or propaganda in this behalf. No good would be done by wearing the sacred thread alone as it could not remove the defects of the Hindu religion.
 Replying to another question as to whether there was difference between his ideals and those of the Arya Samajists, as the latter were telling the people, Gandhiji said there were differences in Arya Samaj itself, as there were several branches of it. Some of their ideals tallied with his, but with regard to others he differed from the Arya Samaj. For instance, while he had no difference as to ideals with Arya Samajists like Ghanshyam Gupta, Speaker of the Central Provinces Assembly, the same could not be said of every Arya Samajist.
 Asked for his advice as to how people should earn a living, Gandhiji said his advice was spinning for all people. He would also suggest weaving and carpentry. The people should devote themselves more and more to these  professions,  thereby leading a pure life.
 Gandhiji again stressed the importance of supply of pure drinking water in every village.

 January 7, 1947 Gandhiji said that if people did not accept this grant, namely Rs. 250 per family, Government should step in and build suitable houses without distinction of
 rich and poor and ask people to live therein. These houses must, however, be
 inspected by a competent engineer. No building but huts would do for the present.
 Mr. Zaman said that he had recommended to Government that the amount of loan should be increased to a maximum of Rs. 1,000 and these loans should also be interest free, to be payable in ten equal instalments. Moreover, an artisans’ grant of Rs. 200 should be granted. He had also recommended a utensils grant of Rs. 10 for each member of a family with a maximum limit of Rs. 100 to a family, this grant being free for members of a looted family. And finally he had recommended a cattle purchase grant of Rs. 250 for every farmer.
 Gandhiji, in his reply, said that he did not see why interest should be charged for these loans. He added that If Government did not charge interest it would be very much appreciated by the people.

         MASIMPUR, 
  January 	7, 1947  Gandhiji 	said that some Muslims had left the prayer ground. On enquiry he had 	come to learn that they had left because Ramdhun 	was being sung. He 	was glad that it occurred on the very first day of his pilgrimage. 	It was a matter for deep regret that his      
 Muslim friends should have been upset at the singing of Ramdhun. It indicated the nature of obstacles that must be faced and overcome if the country was to make progress. The nature of propaganda carried on here has been such that the Muslims could not even bear to hear Ramdhun sung by Hindu devotees.
I am sorry because some of my friends had not been able to
 bear any name of God except Khuda but I am glad because they have had the courage of expressing their dissent openly and plainly. This small incident probably gives an inkling of the mentality which had prevailed during the fateful October disturbances in the district. I am extremely careful not to wound the susceptibilities of anyone unneces-sarily. It is essential that my Muslim brethren should realize as also the Hindus that it does not matter by what name God is addressed. It is the same Creator whom people worship through many tongues. I appeal to the Muslim brethren to assure me of that freedom which is true to the noblest traditions of Islam. Even from the Muslim League platforms it has been repeatedly said that in Pakistan there will be full tolerance of the practice of their faiths by the minorities and that they will enjoy freedom of worship equally with the majority.
 Gandhiji observed that Pakistan did not and could not mean that Hindus in Bengal and Sind should give up their religion and follow the practice of the majority community in order not to rouse the latter’s displeasure. God could be approached through namaz as well as Ramdhun and there could not be a quarrel among branches of the same tree.
 Gandhiji said that there was nothing to quarrel over the Hindus, Muslims and Christians. When Gandhiji started from Chandipur, it was proposed that all through his way Ramdhun would be sung. But he thought better of it lest it displeased the Muslims. Although Ramdhun was very dear to him he did not like the idea that his Muslim brothers should think their Hindu brothers to be so arrogant as to march singing Ramdhun because of Gandhiji’s presence.
 Gandhiji added that he had been very careful in his speeches and deeds not to offend his Muslim brethren. He would desist from anything that displaced their sentiments or offended their religion. But he could never give up his Ramdhun which brought him so much mental peace. He had come to Noakhali to serve  all communities, to help them to live together peacefully and in healthy atmosphere. Every day during prayer, he not only recited from the Bhagavad Gita but also from the Koran, and religious differences simply did not exist for him.
 He had come to Noakhali, Gandhiji said, to serve Hindus and Muslims alike. But he would be helpless if Muslims wanted him to forgo the name of his God in exchange. As he did not like to parade his religion, so also he could not forgo his
 religious belief. It was the unity of God and religion that he had come to preach. He could not give it up, Gandhiji said, so long as he lived.
 Concluding, Gandhiji pleaded for tolerance from the majority community and urged and minority community not to give up reciting Ramdhun in all humility and without any feeling of hostility towards others. With proper understanding of each other’s religion, Gandhiji said, Muslim progress would be repaid and certain.libtech_519_footnote

339,"January 8, 1947",LETTER TO SHRIKRISHNADAS JAJU,"
         CHI. 	JAJUJI,       Wednesday, 	January 8, 1947 
  	Your letter of December 9 reached me around the 19th. Manu read it 	out to me. But it remained unanswered for lack of time. In the 	meanwhile I received another letter yesterday—it is dated December 	30—and it was also yesterday that I embarked on my walking tour. 	During the tour the correspondence is to be reduced to the minimum. 	For the past few days, I have been waking up daily at 2.30 or 3 in 	the morning and writing or dictating. In no other way can I cope 	with my work. I know that this method of working is wrong but I have 	no choice. If God wishes to save me, He will. If I restrict myself 	to the work here and completely stop letter-writing, there will be 	no need to wake up too early. Maybe I shall have to do that. Another 	way is that I should appoint old workers and sit back myself. But 	this seems wrong to me. There is no doubt that it was the proper 	thing to entrust independent work to the old co-workers. A great 	deal depends on how much burden Manu can bear. Enlisting someone 	else will go against my resolve. Throughout the tour I have to face 	the conflict between dharma and adharma. Manu sleeps in the 	same bed with me. When I get up I wake her up and dictate to her. So 	far she too is pulling along well. So much for the background—it 	was necessary to give some, otherwise I could have saved this much 	time.  	Now I come to the letter of December 9. From the latest I heard 	about your health from V. Lal it would seem that it is improving. 	Keep up the improvement and remain fully absorbed in your work.    
 My work should not be a hindrance to anyone. You may ask me whatever you wish to. I am carrying on a pleasant correspondencelibtech_520_footnotewith Prakasam about the work in Madras; whatever will be will be. I am rendering some help. We ourselves will have to act as experts. He will not be able to do it. What he can see to is that there will be no obstruction from the Government machinery. The Textile Commiss- ioner it would appear is a competent man. The final result is in the hands of God. Regarding Saraladevi what I want is that she should be appointed without delay. She is a very neat and efficient worker. I believe Dastaneji is already carrying on some correspondence with her. If I am unable to give a final verdict, obviously the Board of Trustees must do what it deems proper. About the  Punjab developments I feel that if things reach the point  of  fighting  we should fight. But I think the occasion will not arise. You should keep writing to Rajkumari. If there is an opportunity I  shall  write something.
 Your second letter is brief. There is nothing more to be said about the exhibition in Madras. I say this much for the future that if the Provincial Government or the Central Government or even the Congress itself adopts a policy contrary to that of the A. I. S. A., we must follow our khadi policy even at the risk of leaving the Congress. There is no doubt that we shall render true service to the Congress and the nation by acting in this manner. We are entitled to hold an independent opinion, which means that the public is quite awakened and enlightened regarding our policy.
 
     [PS.]  Blessings 	from  BAPU   I have 	gone through the statement of the A. I. S. A. I got up at 3 
  	o’clock, had it read out to me and read some of it myself. I am 	sending a wire today. You will have got it. I do not think that the 	statement needs to be revised. On the whole it reads well. You 	should regard me as useless for such work till my work here is 	completed. On reading it I was convinced that we should have 	decentralization as soon as possible. I think I did write upon this 	matter. We must    
 produce experts. We had better grant Dhiren Mazmudar the amount he wants. Rajkumari is probably in Delhi. She will not come here now.

         FATEHPUR, 
  January 	8, 1947  	I am so happy to see so many of you here this evening. It is a grand 	day for me.   1  The 	reports in the various sources have been collated. 
 When he reached Fatehpur in the morning, Gandhiji said, he had been surrounded by affection all round, and among the messages received were also some from sisters. They wanted to present him with sweets specially prepared by them, but Gandhiji had replied that he was hungering not for sweets for the tongue but for sweets for the heart. He was grateful for the accommodation offered by the village, that was all that he needed. Gandhiji did not want to be a burden on any village through which he was passing. His own food was carried along with him while the expenses of the whole party had already been defrayed by loving friends.
 Some Muslim friends had asked him why a feeling of estrangement was growing between the two communities in spite of the able leadership around, more specially in the Congress and the League. Gandhiji confessed that it was indeed true that the people in general always followed the lead which came from  above.  Therefore, it was not enough that leadership was able but it was necessary that there was accurate knowledge of the wants of the people. For himself he was only trying to depend wholly upon God and work at the task which came naturally to him. He commended the same course to everyone.
 Today I am going through the greatest test of my life. I am now to find if the road that I follow is really the true road for all people of this country. I will not leave Noakhali unless I am assured by members of both communities that they would live like brothers in perfect unity. If success does not come to me, I will not go away from Noakhali a defeated man, but would rather die in the achievement of my mission.
 Gandhiji told his audience that some Muslims had come to him to seek his advice as to which was the right road he should ask them to follow. He told them that he himself was in darkness and was searching for the right road and unless he found the same, he could not show them that path. The road that he was searching today was the road of unity but he could not tell them how to reach that road. He wanted them all to pray for success of his mission so that he might show to the country the right road to follow.

  1947              KAZIRKHIL, 
        DEAR 	FRIEND,  RAMGANJ 	P. S.,  NOAKHALI,  January 	9, 1947 
  	As you are aware I am on the move from day to day and this is the 	third daylibtech_525_footnote. I 	have had varied experience on  the  first  two  days    
 which is worth noticing. On the first day at Mashimpur at the evening prayer there was Ramdhun as usual. The Muslim part of the audience stayed there during the Ramdhun and then some of them withdrew at half-past five without saying why they were going. I observed that it was not time for evening namaz because the sun was still shining. So I asked one of my co-workers to enquire why they had gone. They quickly replied that they did so because Ramdhun was recited at the meeting. I, therefore, spoke about the withdrawal, a report of which you must have seen in the papers.libtech_526_footnote
 Yesterday was a pleasing contract. I was accommodated at Fatehpur by Maulvi Ibrahim Sahib in his madressa. He and his fellow- Muslims were very kind and very attentive. The Muslims attended the prayer meeting in large numbers. I had enquired beforehand whether they had any objection to the Ramdhun and they said they had none. But they would like us to have no tabla or accompaniment because the meeting would be held practically in front of the mosque. I at once saw the point and without a murmur told my companion, who was in charge of the tour, not to have any such accompaniment. The Muslim part of the audience sat out the whole meeting and Maulana Ibrahim Sahib took part in it and spoke affectionately about the programme.
 Today however, at at Dashpara, I observed that at first a poor Muslim had consented to have me on his farm. But later  on  he recanted and said he would not like to run the risk of the resentment of fellow-Muslims. And so I am on a plot of ground owned by a Hindu. The population in this village is overwhelmingly Muslim, there being 350 Muslim families to sixteen Hindu families.
 I do not mention this by way of complaint. I had expected varied experience both pleasant and unplesant. I bring this to your notice in order that, if you felt like it, you might use your influence in the direction you must consider right as a man, not as the Chief Minister. You will readily do so if you realise that I am engaged on purely a mission of peace and as an equal friend of both the parties.
 I   enclose   herewith   a   copy   of   a    statement    made    by Dr. Varadarajan Pillai. It seems to be an extraordinary thing if it is true. I have asked Prof. Nirmal Kumar Bose, whom of course you know and who is with me, to write to the Magistrate. But I felt that I should bring this matter to your notice.
 
 There are other things that have come under my observation. But I am anxious not to tax your energy more than necessary. For the time being therefore I forbear.
 One thing more I had forgotten to mention earlier.  In this village (Dashpara) Muslims told some Hindu friends that all my attempts at bringing about real friendship between the two commu- nities must fail so long as I go about fully protected by armed police or military, by whatever name these guards may be called. The fright of the military keeps them from coming to me and asking all sorts of questions for the resolution of their doubts. I do see some force in their argument. There will be none if either community was really brave. Unfortunately both lack this very necessary human quality. I would, therefore, like you to reconsider the position and if you feel convinced, to withdraw this escort. I do not need it. I even feel embarrassed and it certainly interferes with my sadhana. If you think that a firm and unequivocal written absolution from me will solve your difficulty I would be quite prepared to consider any draft that you may send me for signature. Failing that I suggest your making a declaration that on a satisfactory assurance being given to you by the Muslims in the area through which I may pass regarding my safety, you will withdraw the escort. If this happens it will be a dignified procedure. I will certainly appreciate it and it will produce a good effect all round. I hinted at some such thing at the prayer meeting this evening.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

         DASPARA, 
  January 9, 1947 Gandhiji said he had been assured of a large Muslim gathering at Daspara as the village was predominantly Muslim but very few had assembled and he was told that  many 	Muslims had left and that others did not come through fear of the 	police accompanying him. He felt ashamed that even one Muslim should 	have absented himself due to fear.  Gandhiji 	said that at the previous village he had lived in the house of 	Moulvi Ibrahim and a large number of Muslims were present at the 	prayer. He had always intended that he should live in Muslim houses 	during his tour in Eastern Bengal. His hosts would not have to spend 	anything as his needs regarding food would previously have been 	arranged for. From his Muslim friends he only wanted shelter.  He 	was pained 	to learn 	that many people 	in the 	village had 	left as they 	heard that 	Gandhiji had 	with him military and 	police. He 	would not like to 	depend on 	the military 	or the 	police for 	protection but 	the Bengal Government had 	decided to 	give him 	this protection. After 	all who could 	protect him if 	he fell ill or 	was otherwise 	to die. 	Only God could 	give real protection. Innocent people need have no 	fear. If 	people had 	done anything wrong 	they should 	repent before 	God and pray  for  His forgiveness.libtech_529_footnote One 	who is afraid of God should shed all fear of man. Those      
 who are guilty must take refuge in God. No man on earth can say of himself that he has never erred in life. It is only when one realizes one’s mistakes, makes a clear confession of all one’s crimes before God and takes a solemn pledge that one will not repeat them that one may expect mercy from God. But in any case, the sinner should humbly stand before God and be prepared to accept whatever punishment He may bestow.
 I would  suggest  one  course  to  Muslim  friends assembled here. You must tell the Bengal Government, which  is  guided  by public opinion, that my tour of the villages in the district means no harm to anyone and that I should be taken at my word. You must assure the Government that you could not possibly do any harm to a sojourner in your midst and that you regard it as an affront that the Government should fear any mischief on the part of the local Muslims and decide to send an escort for me. If you write in that vein to the Ministry,  then  my  own  requestlibtech_530_footnotelibtech_531_footnoteto  the   same   quarter   to   withdraw military protection from me is likely to be entertained.

  	I got your letter of December 16, 1946. I am advisinglibtech_533_footnotelibtech_534_footnoteSushila 	to go at the earliest opportunity. The education of children will be 	disturbed, but that seems to me inevitable. I had a letter from 	Sushila, too. I therefore, think, that she will start at the 	earliest. You should now wait for her and put up with the hardships 	till she arrives. It is no use at all worrying about me. God is 	taking the utmost care of me and protecting me. These days I get up 	daily at 3, and there has been no trouble so far. But I feel unhappy 	that, though I am able to eat my normal food, I cannot attend to all 	the work. However, that problem also will be solved. I am now 	arranging the work with that end in view. Do not worry in the least. 	And, moreover, I have so arranged the work that it is desirable to 	have the fewest possible co-workers with me just now. Sushila Pai 	and Sushila Nayyar have been posted separately and are working 	independently. With me are Nirmal Babu and Manu and a person named 	Ramachandran. He works hard but I cannot use him much.

I am still surrounded by darkness. I have no 	doubt whatever that it indicates a flaw somewhere in my method. Take 	it as though I had confined myself to this place to detect that 	flaw.

  January 	10, 1947 Gandhiji 	said he had been hearing for some time—and more insistently since yesterday—that if 	Muslims asked Hindus to accept Islam if they wanted to save  themselves 	or their property, and if the latter responded, there was no 	compulsion. Gandhiji said he was not concerned for a moment with the 	truth or otherwise of that statement. What he wanted to say was that 	this was acceptance of Islam under all the threat of force.  Conversion, 	Gandhiji held, was made 	of sterner 	stuff. The statement 	reminded him 	of the days when 	Christian missionaries so 	called used to 	buy children in 	days of 	famine and bring 	them up as Christians. 	This was surely no  	acceptance  of  Christianity. 	Similarly, acceptance of 	Islam, to 	be real and valid, 	should be wholly 	voluntary and 	must be based 	on proper 	knowledge of the 	two faiths—one’s own 	and the 	one presented for 	acceptance. Gandhiji 	could not conceive 	of the 	possibility of 	such acceptance of 	Islam by 	the women in 	front of 	him or children. This was 	the view Gandhiji 	had held all his life. 	He did 	not believe in 	conversion as 	an institution. He 	would not ask his friends 	to accept 	Hinduism because he 	happened to 	be a Hindu. 	Those who came to him 	with such a mind were recommended proper study of Hinduism and 	were told to incorporate 	in their 	own religion 	what was considered 	good in Hinduism. He 	called himself not 	merely a 	Hindu but 	a Christian, 	a Muslim, 	a Jew, 	a Sikh, 	a Parsee, 	a Jain 	or a 	man of 	any other 	sect, meaning thereby 	that he 	had absorbed 	all that was commendable 	in all 	other religions and 	sub-religions. In 	this way, he avoided any clash and expanded his own conception of religion.  What 	he had 	said might not 	commend itself to 	everybody. But 	he would 	like every 	Muslim to consider 	whether from what he had 	said it 	was not possible for 	them to see 	that Islam was 	much superior 	to what 	had been 	described to 	him during 	his pilgrimage. He had prayerfully studied as much as he could in his busy life of Islam’s    
 history written by Muslim divines and he had not found a single passage in condonation of forcible conversion such as he had described. Real conversion proceeded from the heart and a heart conversion was  impossible  without  an intelligent grasp of one’s own faith and of that recommended for adoption.
 Concluding, Gandhiji said that he was not going to be satisfied without a heart understanding between the two communities and this was not possible unless the Hindus and Muslims were prepared to respect each other’s religion leaving the process of conversion absolutely free and voluntary.

366,"January 	11, 1947",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
         LAMCHAR, 
  January 	11, 1947  Gandhiji 	 began his  after-prayer 	 speech  at 	 Lamchar  by  saying  	that  he 	would  confine himself to  a  question  that 	  had   been   facing 	  him   for   the   last 	few days. He gathered 	that a large number of artisans had lost both their homes as well  	as their 	instruments of 	trade which had 	either been destroyed 	or stolen. 	What was 	going to 	be done about these people?  There 	was a time, 	he said, 	when our villages 	had a full 	complement of artisans 	serving farmers. The 	latter were 	the centre of 	gravity of 	village economy. Payment 	was then 	made in kind, 	and it 	was in 	conformity with the 	needs of 	the producers, 	just as 	production itself 	was strictly 	related to the needs of 	the people. Different 	occupations were 	knit together by 	a bond 	of interdependence 	into an 	integrated whole. 	This was India’s 	village economy 	in pre-British 	days and in it all communities, 	including the 	Mussalmans shared 	to the fullest extent. 	Under its 	dispensation, no man could go without food, shelter and clothing in a village.  But 	the problem which faced the villagers in this part of the country 	today was what should be done about the artisans whose life had been 	dislocated by riots. Gandhiji expressed his hope that it would even 	now be possible to restore village economy to a sufficient extent to 	cope with the problem of unemployment. It was the first duty of the 	Government to provide the artisans with dwelling houses as well as 	to supply them with instruments and raw materials needed for plying 	their trade. Cash loans may be arranged; these should be free of 	interest and the payment spread conveniently over a long term. 	Naturally the question of security should not arise. The Government 	should be prepared to lose their money if any artisans died before 	full recovery of loans.  But 	if the Government did not perform its obvious duty, then moneyed men 	should come forward for the same purpose. They should help the 	artisans on the same terms as sketched above. Indeed, it was their 	duty to do so. The bond of co-operation which would thus be created 	between different classes of population, was a necessary 
 factor if our object was once more to restore healthy village life.libtech_547_footnote
 He advised the evacuees to brave all hardships and return home quickly. By means of their own labour they must be determined to rebuild their ruined homes as well as their lives.

 any man for his faith. Hinduism has undoubtedly sinned gravely through its custom of untouchability. All my life I have struggled for the eradication of that evil. But if the Muslims  hate  the  Hindus because they worship the one God by a different name and in a different way, then the Muslims are practising the  untouchability which is against the teachings of Islam. I am working for the day when the Muslims will be able to say to their Hindu neighbours that it does not matter by what name or in what way they worship God.

 In this way the situation will further deteriorate. When did I rebuke you ? If you see rebuke in what I said can we go on ? I do not even know if she talked to you before or after my suggestion.

BHATIALPUR,
    Gandhiji 	thanked them and said :  January 	14, 1947 
  	If your words come from your heart and not merely from your lips, 	then their effect will not be confined merely to India but will 	spread over the whole world.  They 	asked what his objection was to the setting up of a separate Muslim 	State after the events in Bihar. Gandhiji replied :  	If a Muslim State implied freedom to make unfriendly treaties with 	foreign powers to the detriment of the country, then obviously it 	cannot be a matter of agreement. No one can be asked to sign an 	agreement granting freedom to another to launch hostilities against 	himself; it would be suicidal policy.  On 	the young 	men asking 	whether Gandhiji did not 	think it 	advisable to 	concede Pakistan since 	it was holding 	back the issue of  Indian 	 independence,  Gandhiji said:  	Only after independence has been won can there be a question of 	granting Pakistan. To reverse the process was to invite foreign 	help. Azadi and Pakistan require the exclusion of all foreign 	powers. Until and unless India is free, there cannot be any other 	question.  	When you think of establishing Pakistan first you think in terms of 	getting it with the aid of a third power. When I  think  of  the 	freedom of India, I think in terms of achieving it without any 	foreign aid, be it Russian, Chinese or any other, but on the basis 	of our own inner strength. Then only will freedom be real and 	lasting. Once freedom is secured for the country as a whole then we 	can decide about Pakistan or Hindustan.  Gandhiji 	was then 	asked why he should 	not go to Bihar 	where the tragedy 	was on 	a colossal scale compared 	to Noakhali. 	His reply 	was : What 	has happened in Bihar is shameful enough. But the people    
 there are said to have realized their mistake. By going there I cannot do anything more than what I can do from here, for I am able to affect the Government and people of Bihar from Noakhali.
 The last question put to  Gandhiji was: After the  recent  disturbances   there is neither Pakistan nor peace. What is your solution to this situation? Gandhiji replied :
That is exactly what I am searching for in Noakhali. As soon as
I discover it the world shall know it.
 While taking leave of Gandhiji the Muslim youths asked for Gandhiji’s blessings to enable them to fulfil the promise made. Gandhiji said that so long as they spoke from their hearts and honestly tried to give effect to their promises, God would be on their side. Gandhiji told the youths that they must discuss what he had said with friends and meet him again if they had more questions to ask.

         BHATIALPUR, 
  January 	14, 1947  	It has been said that Pakistan did not imply  curtailment  of 	liberty to practise one’s own religion and pursue trade or 	profession after one’s own heart. Therefore, it would be wrong on 	your part to think in terms of boycotting the minorty community and 	thus making it impossible for them to carry on their normal life.  Gandhiji 	further observed that boycott implied intolerance and 	the assumption of an attitude of superiority by some over others and said : We 	are sinners because we look down upon  Harijans as  	untouchables. But Islam is great because it made no distinction 	whatever between man and man. If, however, you look down upon Hindus 	because they worship the same God under other names, then you are 	practising the same untouchability which is definitely a violation 	of a fundamental principle of Islam.  The 	number of 	Muslims who 	attended the 	meeting, Gandhiji said, 	was not in 	direct proportion to 	their population in 	the locality. 	When women 	were not afraid 	of him, 	he was puzzled why men 	should be afraid to meet him. 	Islam, Gandhiji 	emphasized, taught fear 	of only God and not man. One should be afraid to commit sin, but 	having committed it, 	one should surrender 	oneself to God and 	cheerfully bear any 	punishment that might be 	meted out. Gandhiji made 	a passing 	reference to the purdah 	system and urged that it should be scrapped. The system kept women in complete 
 darkness in every respect. The women of both communities should mix more freely and get to understand each other better.libtech_567_footnote
 Gandhiji repeated his request to the Muslims to write to H. S. Suhrawardy, the Bengal Premier, for withdrawal of Military and Police giving him protection.
 Gandhiji made a reference to his visit to Muslim houses that morning. He found   that   the   Muslim   women   hesitated    to    come    out    in    his    presence. He recalled the days of the Ali Brothers. At a Muslim women’s meeting the Ali Brothers had tied their eyes with a piece of cloth and delivered their lecture but Gandhiji was allowed to address the meeting with open eyes. Gandhiji added that real purdah was not of the body but the mind. What was needed was real education among women, more so among Muslim women. If darkness of their mind was not removed they could not do anything with outward purdah. Gandhiji also asked the audience to realize that Khuda and Rama were one, only called by different names. He had heard that many Muslims were afraid of punishment and had fled from their homes. A true Muslim, he said, should be afraid of sin and not punishment that might be inflicted due to that sin. Hindus also must learn that Khuda and Rama were one. This was the lesson he would impress upon the audience.

 DEAR BROTHER,
 Here is a copy of a telegram received by me. I know you are in Calcutta in Dr. Bidhan Roy’s good and able hands. At this time you ought to be spared all the trouble from friends who seek your assistance and advice. But I thought that you would perhaps know the facts much more than anybody else and give truer guidance. Hence, this trouble.
 I have telegraphed to Jawaharlal, Sardar, the President of the Congress and Dr. Khan Saheb. I purposely refrained from sending a wire to you in Calcutta. This too will be delivered to you by hand.
 I have seen your statement to the Press about your acceptance of office in the Interim Government. It is quite good and I have not the slightest doubt that your presence in the Cabinet will be of great service at this very critical juncture.
 I hope you will make rapid and solid recovery. Please do not hurry over the treatment. A medical adviser is entitled to consideration from a patient. That he happens to be a close friend of the patient should prove no disqualification from title to consideration if only because consideration shown to a medical adviser is really considera- tion shown to oneself.
 About movement here I dare say you glance at the newspaper reports of my words at the prayer meetings. I have put myself on trial as to whether I am an exponent of true ahimsa or only ahimsa so called. I am not relying upon Pyarelal or Sushila for my Urdu work though I see them often enough. Pyarelal is with me today, this being the last of the fifth village within his beat. If I do not follow this rule, the whole superstructure will come to pieces and the distribution of the party in affected villages will be a mockery.

 Gandhiji said that it was their primary duty to remove untouchability. Unless this virus was removed from their society, there could not be any real progress in this country. Secondly Hindu-Muslim unity should be effected. Both the Hindus and the Muslims should be eager to achieve this end. They took water from the same tank and rice from the same paddy fields. For the time being, they should forget politics and devote their sole attention to improve villages, spread education, develop industries and other constructive work. For this purpose, workers must be prepared to die.
 Replying to a question whether the refugees  should  now  return  home, Gandhiji said that they must return home at the earliest. They must, however, shed fear. Spinning also should form an important part of the duty of the workers. If they span at least one hour a day, they could supply yarn to weavers who were now looking  up to the Government for such supply for their handlooms. The cloth problem would consequently be easier in this way.

         NARAYANPUR, 
  January 	15, 1947 At 	the beginning of his prayer speech at Narayanpur, Gandhiji expressed 	his happiness at having been able to spend another night under the 	roof of a Muslim  friend 	in the course of his walking tour. In spite of the fact that he had 	been trying to reduce the size of his entourage, his efforts in that 	direction had so far not been very successful. And he was glad that 	his host had proved equal to the occasion and had not been baffled 	by the size of his party.  Then 	Gandhiji referred to an 	incident that had 	occurred a 	short while ago. The 	elders of the house 	wanted him to meet the zanana 	ladies. He 	had made an 	attempt, but 	without success. It 	was true, 	he continued, 	that Hindu 	women attended the prayer 	in large 	numbers. In this 	respect they 	were more advanced. But 	as such 	it became 	their duty 	to befriend their Muslim sisters and rescue them from the thraldom 	of the  purdah. 	 If they 	neglected this 	neighbourly duty, 	there was obviously 	some defect on 	their part.  India, 	Gandhiji said, was aspiring to be free. But if half the population 	was to remain in a paralysed condition, the type of freedom the 	people would attain could    
 never be perfect. Therefore, with utmost humility, he once more appealed to the elders among the audience to examine the effect of the purdah system and do away with it in the shortest possible time. For, in his opinion, the system, as he saw in his peregrination, was quite contrary to what the Prophet had preached.

MEETINGlibtech_583_footnote","
    
 
 RAMDEBPUR,
  January 	16, 1947  Gandhiji 	said that he had received certain questions from some Muslims while 	he was in Narayanpur yesterday.  [The 	first question was :] How could he adviselibtech_584_footnoteAssam and the Sikhs 	in the Punjab to stay out of Groups if his aim was Hindu-Muslim 	unity and how, after this, was it possible for the Muslim League to 	join the Constituent Assembly?  Gandhiji 	said there 	was no 	“if” about 	his aim. Hindu-Muslim 	unity had been 	his aim from 	his youth 	upward, that is, for an 	unbroken period of 	60 years. He 	saw no contradiction 	between his aim and his 	advice to 	the people 	of Assam, 	the Sikhs 	and, for 	that matter, the 	Frontier and 	those who 	felt like it, to stay 	out of Groups 	or from 	the Constituent 	Assembly. The Cabinet 	Mission’s Paper was 	of a 	voluntary nature 	and no party 	could be compelled 	to join 	the Constituent 	Assembly. They had no 	force to back their resolution or wishes except the force of public opinion.  He 	had, therefore, given no advice which should make it impossible for 	the Muslim League to join the Constituent Assembly. So far as he had 	read the resolution passed at the recent A. I. C. C. meeting,libtech_585_footnotethe Congress had 	completely identified itself with the Cabinet Mission’s Paper.  Gandhiji 	hoped that the Muslim 	League would join the 	Constituent Assembly 	in which 	it was 	open to 	it to make good its 	position by 	an appeal to 	reason. Otherwise 	the Constituent Assembly, 	because it was a  	voluntary organization brought into 	being by the 	only party that had 	force behind it, 	was like a 	house of 	cards. It 	could only become 	a solid 	structure if 	it was backed 	by the 	opinion of 	the Indian 	masses. Staying out by 	certain provines or 	groups could not 	and should not 	be  a hindrance to the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly, if it was otherwise good.  Gandhiji 	would ask: Why should 	Assam be absorbed 	in Bengal 	against its will 	or  the  Frontier 	 Province  or  the  Sikhs 	  into   the 	  Punjab   and   Sind?   The 	Congress or 	the League, 	as the 	case may be, should make 	their programme 	and policy 	intrinsically attractive 	so as 	to appeal to 	the reason of 	the recalcitrant Province 	or Group.  The 	second question put to him was: Gandhiji claimed to be a friend of 	both the communities, but he had been nursing back his own community 	for the last two months in Noakhali. What about the Muslims of 	Bihar, who have lost their all?  He 	would say the question ignored facts. He was not “nursing back” 	his own      
 community. He had no community of his own except in the sense that he belonged to all communities. His record spoke for itself. He freely admitted that he was trying to bring comfort to the Hindus of Noakhali, but not at the expense of the Muslims. If there was a sick member in his family and he seemed to attend to the sick member, it surely did not mean that he neglected the others.
 He had had repeated an insistent advice from Muslim friends that his place  was more in Bihar, where the Muslims were, in point of numbers, much greater sufferers than the Hindus in Noakhali. He was sorry that he had hitherto failed to make his Muslim critics see that he had sufficiently affected  the  Hindus  of  Bihar  in favour of the Muslim sufferers. If he listened to his critics against his own better reason and went to Bihar, it was just likely that he might injure the Muslim cause rather than serve it.
 Thus, for instance, he might not find corroboration for the many charges brought against the Bihar Hindus and the Bihar Government and, in order to be able to make such a declaration, he had accepted the better course, namely, to advise the Bihar Ministry, which had accepted his advice, that they should jointly with the Bengal Government or by themselves, appoint an impartial commission of inquiry.libtech_586_footnote
 [The third question was :] Why cannot the apostle of non-violence, the modern Buddha stop internecine war and blood-bath in the country?
 Gandhiji, replying to this question, acquitted himself from the charge of being the modern Buddha. He was and claimed to be a simple man having extensive experience at his back, but on that account claimed to be no better than any member of the audience. He was an equal servant of both the communities or all the communities of India. He wished he had the power to stop ‘internecine war’ and consequent ‘blood-bath’. The Buddha or the prophets that followed him had gone the way they went in order to stop wars. The fact that he could not do so was proof positive that he had no superior power at his back. It was true that he swore by non- violence and so he had come to Noakhali in order to test the power of his non- violence. As he had repeatedly said ever since his arrival in Bengal, he had no desire to leave Bengal unless both the communities showed by their action that they were like blood-brothers living together in perfect peace and amity.
 Gandhiji also dealt with a  question that was raised by  the Muslim   friends
 who had seen him  before  the  prayer  meeting.  They  had  asked  him  how  he expected friendly relations between the two communities when the Hindus agitated for the arrest and trial of those who were guilty of murders, arson and loot during the disturbances. The speaker confessed that he did not like these complaints. But he sympathized with the complainants so long as the wrongdoers avoided arrest and trial and so  long as  Muslim opinion in  Noakhali did not insist upon the guilty  parties
 
 disclosing themselves. He would be glad to see Muslim opinion working actively to bring the offenders not before the court of justice but before the court of public opinion. Let the offenders show contrition and let them return the looted property.
 Let them also show to those against whom offences were committed that they need fear no molestation, that the days of frenzy were over. Muslim public opinion should be such as to guarantee that miscreants would not dare to offend against any individual and only then could Hindus be asked to return safely to their villages. The speaker was sure that such purging before the court of public opinion was infinitely superior to a trial before a court of law. What was wanted was not vengeance but reformation.

        DEAR 	PRAKASAM,  NOAKHALI DISTT.,  January 	17, 1947 
  	I got yesterday your air mail letter of 9th instant. This means six 	days and you will know for your information how far I am from the 	haunts of so-called civilization. I got also your telegram yesterday 	saying that you would be sending a special representative with 	documents and instructions. I shall await them.  	Meanwhile, I have hurriedly read through your Advocate- General’s 	opinionlibtech_587_footnote. In 	the place of his signature there is a blank. The opinion is very 	elaborate and instructive. Will you, however, tell the 	Advocate-General that it would have been very helpful if he had 	summarised his conclusions and also if he had framed questions he 	has answered? Better still would have been if you had stated a case 	for his opinion. Then you could have sent to the Press for public 	information the question and his answers. The public would not be 	interested in the elaborate legal argument with which he has backed 	his conclusion.  Yours 	sincerely,  From 	a copy: Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and Library.

KAZIRKHIL,
           DEAR 	HAMIDUDDIN SAHEB,  RAMGANJ 	P.S., NOAKHALI DISTT.,  January 	17/19, 1947 
  	I thank you for your letter of 10th instant received by me only 	yesterday. I understand the cause of delay that took place in 	replying to my letter. I do not propose to enter into any 	controversy with you. But I propose to confine myself to removing 	misunderstanding that lurks in your letter.  	A statement of mine about the happenings in Noakhali would have been 	premature, for the impressions formed have been damaging and facts 	that come to me even now are disturbing, if they are true as at 	least some of them seem to me to be. The volunteers who are working 	are not under my guidance or discipline. Their removal is surely the 	function of the Government. I can  only  remove  those whom I have 	brought with me. I have already told Saheed Saheb that if for any 	reason whatsoever he finds the presence of anyone of them to be 	harmful to the country, he has but to serve a notice on them and 	they will go away without a murmur. I have excepted from the 	category only myself and a grand-daughter of mine who is with me. Of 	course I know nothing of the subversive activities of any of the 	volunteers. But if the report received by you is true and I were in 	your place I would certainly see to it that those responsible for 	such activities were summarily removed. I have no recollection of 	your having ever suggested to me to get rid of any volunteer. I 	would like you to tell me what I have said in public about the Bihar 	Government or the report of the Bihar Muslim League. I have been 	most reticent about these things. I have certainly entered into 	correspondence with Saheed Saheb and others. But I am not aware of 	having said much in public.  	I am sorry that I cannot accept your advice about Bihar nor can  I 	endorse your estimate of the situation if I were in Bihar. My firm 	opinion is that I could not do service to the Muslim cause by going 	to Bihar. Immediately I feel that I could, I assure you that I would 	not    
 wait for any prompting from you or any other friend. I have been in correspondence with friends who know and they dissuade me from going to Bihar, and that for very good reasons. But I must not go into it at this stage.
 You astound me when you tell me that you found Hindus were not the least enthusiastic about peace committees. When we last parted, you left me under the impression that you at least were going to stay in the district and see through the working of the peace committees and you then appeared to be very enthusiastic about all that was happening at the formation of the peace committees.
 Of course I should like you to visit this district again irrespective of whether I still “require any explanation”.
 Yours sincerely,

  	What has happened in Noakhali is God’s curse, not only for Bengal 	but for the whole of India and it is high time that our outlook was 	changed.  Gandhiji 	said that  Hindu 	 women  should  give up  the  habit 	 of  differen- 	tiating between high and 	low and between caste and 	caste. They should move 	with all women 	on a 	basis of 	equality. In 	particular Gandhiji 	advised Hindu women to 	mix freely with 	their Muslim sisters. If 	the women of 	the two communities 	had been on 	terms of friendship and 	if Hindu women were in close touch with their Muslim sisters, much of what happened in Noakhali could have been prevented.  Gandhiji 	also advised women in the villages not to waste any of their spare 	time but to take to spinning and other subsidiary work, such as 	keeping their villages clean and the water in their tanks pure.  Gandhiji 	also said that his advice to the Hindu women applied to the men also 	and they should move as friends among the Muslims. By friendly 	contact misunderstandings were cleared and chances of quarrels were 	eliminated.  Amrita 	Bazar Patrika, 20-1-1947         PARKOTE,  January 	17, 1947  	The sword can be met by the sword but that will lead to nothing. 	Remain non-violent and harbour no fear. If every one of you sheds 	fear, then the forty-two of you will be as strong as 4200.  After 	the talk Gandhiji asked the volunteers whether they were free from 	fear. 
 One of the volunteers said they felt no fear—but only when all forty-two of them were together.
That means that each of you is still possessed by fear, which
means that all of you are.
 Volunteers should have no fear even individually. Whatever may happen, you should never bow down your heads and succumb to fear and dishonour.
 Gandhiji asked the volunteers to engage themselves in work beneficial to the village. They should mix with the Muslims as brothers and friends. He deprecated the taking up of the lathi to fight the lathi and said this would never solve the problem. He said :
You cannot defeat anyone with the help of the lathi, but only
with love.
 When the volunteers asked Mahatma Gandhi to give them his blessings, Gandhiji said :
You have my blessings, but only if you follow my advice.

410,"January 	17, 1947","SPEECH AT PRAYER
MEETINGlibtech_590_footnote","
         PARKOTE, 
  January 	17, 1947  At 	Parkote, on the morning of the 17th, Gandhiji had read a speech 	delivered by the Qaid-e-Azam on the occasion of the foundation 	ceremony of a Girls’ High School by his sister, Miss Fatima 	Jinnah. During the after-prayer speech in the evening, he translated 	a portion of that speech in which Mr. Jinnah was reported to have 	said that Muslims should develop a high sense of responsibility, 	justice and integrity. Wrong was not to be imitated. If after 	consulting one’s conscience one felt that a contemplated action 	was wrong, one should never do it irrespective of any consideration 	or influence. If people acted up to this rule, no one would be able 	to prevent them from attaining Pakistan.  Commenting 	upon this, Gandhiji 	said that as 	there was no 	question of 	force here 	and  if  Pakistan  was 	 going  to 	 be  established by  sterling 	 qualities  of 	character,  everybody 	 would  welcome  such  a  	State,  no 	 matter  by  what  name  it 	 was called.libtech_591_footnote  No 	one could agree, he said, that loot, arson or forcible conversion,     
 no matter where committed, could ever be supported by the awakened conscience of man.
 Gandhiji referred to the fact that the celebration was in connection with a girls’ school and recalled that Mr. Jinnah had advised the Education Minister in Sind to launch a determined drive against illiteracy. In this lay the secret of future peace and unity. Literary education by itself did not carry one far for there never had been any dearth of literary men. What was needed was education for life. Men and women, he continued, were two limbs of the social body and if one limb was atrophied then the whole body would suffer in consequence. It was, therefore, very unfortunate that our sisters should be left in darkness and ignorance.
 Hindu women joined the prayer in large numbers. Why should not Muslim girls, if not women, find it possible to join the prayer? The obvious duty of the Hindu sisters, Gandhiji continued, was to go to their Muslim sisters purely in a spirit  of service.
 Gandhiji  added  that   they   ought   to   remember   Qaid-e-Azam   Jinnah’s advice and act up to it; for it was advice not confined to any particular community; it was of universal significance. The qualities which he had advised people to develop were not combativeness but a sense of justice and truth; and this implied that whenever justice was at stake, people ought to appeal to reason instead of taking recourse to barbarous methods of settling disputes whether private or public.

BADALKOT,
  January 18, 1947 Gandhiji’s answer was that he did not maintain illusion and never ascribed to himself any superior powers. He had met Mr. Jinnah many times, as they knew, and  their 	meetings had been marked by nothing but friendliness. Yet the 	results were negative as they all knew.  The 	fact was, continued Gandhiji, that a leader was made by his fol- 	lowers. He reflected in 	a clearer 	manner the aspirations 	lying dormant 	among the masses. 	This was 	true not only of India 	but of all 	the world. What 	he would 	therefore suggest to 	both Hindus and 	Mussalmans was 	that they should not 	look to 	the Muslim 	League or the 	Congress or 	the Hindu 	Mahasabha for the 	solution of 	their daily problems of 	life. For 	that they should look 	towards themselves; and 	if they did 	that then their desire 	for neighbourly peace 	would be reflected 	by the 	leaders. The 	political institutions 	might be 	left to 	deal with specifically 	political questions but 	how much did 	they know about 	the daily 	needs of individuals? 	If a 	neighbour was 	ailing, would they run 	to the 	Congress or 	the League 	to ask 	them what should be 	done? That was an 	unthinkable proposition.  On 	the previous evening Gandhiji had quoted Mr. Jinnah’s advice that 	women should rapidly be rescued from illiteracy. But Gandhiji said 	that that was not enough. Was the condition of the literate men any 	better for their literacy? Were they not, he asked, subject to the 	passing fashions of the political world? Germany, which had lain so 	long under Hitler, proved what he meant; as all knew it was in a 	sorry plight today. It was not literacy or learning which made a 	man, but education for real life. What did it matter if they knew 	everything but did not know how to live as brothers with their 	neighbours?  Gandhiji 	continued that if 	some people 	had committed 	grievous mistakes in 	their dealings with their 	neighbours, they should repent and 	ask God to forgive 	them. If 	He forgave them but the world did not, even then it did not matter 	to a man who had learnt 	to depend 	on God; 	such punishment nobly 	borne served to elevate 	a man. 	Gandhiji then 	said that in a 	book of 	sayings of 	the Prophet 	he had 	found that a man 	should never leave an 	error uncorrected. If he did, he would be hauled up on the Day of 	judgment and find no 	favour in the eyes of God.    
 It was not enough that they acquired the art of reading, writing, etc. It was necessary that they should learn the art of living on friendly terms with their neighbours. They should rescue the womenfolk, who formed half their numbers, from the thraldom of ignorance and superstition. Men should live in co-operation and work for the common good. For this, they should not look up to political parties for direction, but to their own souls or God.
 Personally, Gandhiji said, he had addressed himself wholly to that task. He would not leave this part of the country alive if the work remained unaccomplished. If he succeeded in overcoming the distrust of his Muslim brethren, and in establishing the fact that, after all, it was the daily things of life such as he had mentioned which mattered most, then its effect would be felt not merely in this part of the country but over the whole of India; and as such might even deeply affect the future peace of the world.

  January 	19, 1947  	Whatever I have been trying to say in these days, is contained in 	the sayings of the Prophet. The following passages are  therefore  	culled for your benefit :  No 	man is a true believer unless he desireth for his brother that which 	he desireth for himself.  He 	who neither worketh for himself nor for others will not receive the 	reward of God.    
 He is not of me, but a rebel at heart who when he speaketh, speaketh falsely, who when he promiseth, breaketh his promises and who when trust is reposed in him, faileth in his trust.
 Muslims are those who perform their trust and fail not in their word and keep their pledge.
 Whoever is kind to His creatures, God is kind to him.
 A perfect Muslim is he from whose tongue and hands mankind is safe.    The worst of men is a bad learned man and a good learned man is the best. When a man committeth adultery iman leaveth him.
 He is not a Momin who commiteth adultery or stealeth, or who drinketh liquor or who plundereth or who embezzleth; beware, beware.
 The most excellent jehad is that for  the  conquest of  self. Assist any person oppressed, whether Muslim or non-Muslim.
 The manner in which my followers become eunuchs is by fasting and abstinence.
 Women are the twin halves of men.
 Learned are those who practise what they know.
 The most valuable thing in the world is a virtuous woman.
 Give your wife good counsel; if she has goodness in her she will soon take it; leave off idle thinking and do not beat your noble wife like a slave.libtech_608_footnote
 Gandhiji said that certain Muslims had asked him: ‘Who is this Muslim woman Amtussalaam who is fasting at Sirandi?’ Gandhiji said Amtussalaam had been with him for a long time. She was a true Muslim. She always had Koran-e-Sharif with her and she was never without it. She also read the Gita. After giving her noble family connections, Gandhiji said :
But this pious and noble lady is now on the road to death for the
cause of Hindu-Muslim unity.
 He wished Amtussalaam to be successful in such a great cause.

425,,STATEMENT TO THE PRESS,"
    
 A correspondent writes to me to say that the strained relations between the Hindus and the Muslims bid fair, if timely warning is not taken, to replace Nagari and Urdu scripts with Roman. There are undoubtedly protagonists of the Roman as the universal script.  It seems to me that it would be a great human tragedy if such a result comes about. Time-saving devices are good up to a certain point. But they take the form of a mania when they destroy human relations and desirable restraints. I must not tarry to examine what they are. Suffice it to say that lovers of the Nagari script, which is scientifically almost perfect, and the Urdu script, which is so graceful, will not be carried away by the lazy craze for the Roman script. Would that both the communities will be sane enough to realize that the mutual dislike is not allowed to replace the two Indian scripts. But if that happy consummation does not take place, let those few or many who have regard for sacred human understanding assiduously learn both the scripts and thus enrich the Indian national language, Hindustani, as the
 
 easy fusion of Hindi and Urdu. Let the Provincial Governments beware of the lure of the Roman script. Let it not be said of India that it is so degraded as to become the blotting sheet of civilization.

MEETINGlibtech_618_footnote","
         KETHURI, 
  January 	21, 1947  Gandhiji 	explained the reasons 	which actuated 	the twenty-five 	days’ fast of 	Bibi Amtussalaam and the reasons which brought it to an end. The fast was broken at  9.30 	last evening after the 	recital of 	the Al 	Fateha in a powerful 	and melodious voice  by a 	Muslim gentleman 	who happened 	to be at the 	meeting. Many 	Muslim friends including 	Abdulla Saheb and his  lieutenant exerted themselves during the day 	to find  out how the fast could be ended while Gandhiji was present 	in Sirandi. It was common 	cause that the khadag 	for which 	the fast was said to 	have been undertaken 	could not, in 	spite of 	strenuous and honest 	efforts by 	many persons, be 	traced. And if Amtussalaambehn 	persisted in wanting 	the production 	of the 	khadag, 	she must 	die. But 	Gandhiji had 	explained to 	her that that could 	not be 	the real object 	of the 	fast; it 	must be a symbol of something behind it. Gandhiji then said that the lady’s whole     
 life was devoted to a heart unity between the Hindus and the Muslims. Therefore if there was a real prospect of such unity at least within the area where she was working, there was every prospect of the fast being ended.libtech_619_footnote
 After full and complete deliberation, a document was signed laying down the principle that to each one his religion was equally dear with any other person’s and that therefore different religions were to be mutually respected. To this end the signatories to the agreement have pledged themselves. Naturally, any wilful breach of the promise would implicate me in a fast. On the document being interpreted to Amtul Salaambehn, the lady broke the fast as  said before.
 Gandhiji assured the signatories that he would help to the best of his ability in the matter of preserving the just rights of each community even as he expected them actively to implement their promise.
 Gandhiji also expressed his desire that any development of any kind within the area mentioned in the document must be brought to his notice and convinced them that he would actively assist in the settlement of all disputes. Gandhiji told the Hindus and Muslims of his dislike of matters being rushed to police and law courts. Any surrender of its legitimate rights by the majority community or even  the minority community for the sake of reaching an agreement, Gandhiji warned, would not lead to a lasting peace.

       From 	a photostat of the Hindi: G. N. 5108         Blessings 	from  BAPU         PANIALA, 
  January 22, 1947 Gandhiji was 	happy that 	at last 	he had 	been able to 	visit the 	village of Paniala.libtech_622_footnotelibtech_623_footnoteBut that was not enough; he would feel happier still if the Hindus and the  Mussalmans 	succeeded in establishing unity and friendship between themselves.  Amtussalaam 	had undertaken 	her fast, 	as they 	all knew, 	with the same 	object. And 	the assurance that the 	villagers in 	her neighbourhood 	had given 	to her 	should go 	 a long way in healing the wound which tore the face of Bengal.     
 One problem, continued Gandhiji, which had been recently exercising him was in connection with the families of those who had lost their all in the course of the disturbances. There were many families which had lost their earning members. The survivors had to be looked after, while the children had to be educated and given adequate protection. That undoubtedly was the duty of the Government. Both he and they if they wanted heart peace should look at the question from a broader standpoint. In his humble opinion, where the wrong was done by some Muslims, reasonable arrangements for the above purpose should be made by the Muslims of the neighbourhood.
 Government would only act through force while the common citizen would act through persuasion and agreement. Through the establishment of good human relations, citizens should try to tide over the disasters which might overwhelm the social body. It was not good to depend on an organization based on force like the State for the above purpose.
 Gandhiji then referred to two more matters, namely, the duty of volun- teers and the rehabilitation of artisans. With regard to the volunteers his advice was that they should never discriminate between one type of duty and another, have no preferences, but should stick to their post even at the cost of their lives. It was the quality of discipline and sacrifice which made small things great in organized action. Then, referring to the pro- blem of the artisans, he continued, they ought not to depend upon charity however well-intended but on their own resources in order to tide over their present difficulties. In this connection he referred to his view supported by the scriptures of the world that he who ate his food without returning its equivalent by means of body labour was no better than a thief. Permanent peace would come in the world only when the bond of labour shared in common held together different units of the social body.libtech_624_footnote
 The first question was: “You said that Muslim majority provinces if they so chose had Pakistan already. What did you mean by this?”
 Gandhiji replied that he fully meant what he had said. Whilst there was an outside power ruling India there was neither Pakistan nor Hindustan, but bare slavery was their lot. And if anybody maintained that the measure of provincial autonomy they enjoyed was equal to independence, they were unaware of the contents of Independence. It was true that the British power was certain to go. But if they could not patch up their quarrels and indulged in blood-baths, a combination of powers was certain to hold them in bondage. Those powers would not tolerate a country so vast and populous as India and so rich in potential resources to rot away because of internal disturbances. Every country had to live for the rest. Days when they could
 
 
 drag on the frog-in-the-well existence were gone. Even before the Congress had taken up non-violent non-co-operation as the official policy for the whole of India, that is, before 1920, a resolutionto that effect was passed in Gujarat under the chairmanship of the late Abbas Tyabji Saheb. The speaker had said that it was open even to one province to vindicate its position and become wholly independent of the British power. Thus supposing that following the prescription, Bengal alone became truly and completely independent, there would be complete Pakistan of his defi-nition in Bengal. Islam was nothing if it did not spell complete democracy. Therefore, there would be one man one vote and one woman one vote irrespective of religion. Naturally, therefore, there would be a true Muslim majority in the Province. Had not Jinnah Saheb declared that in Pakistan minorities would, if possible, be even better off than the majority; therefore, there would be no underdog?libtech_625_footnote
 Gandhiji reiterated that if such a State was established by sheer merit and so long as the qualities of truth and justice were emphasized, as had been done by him (Gandhiji), nobody would raise any objection, call it Pakistan or by any other name. If the Muslims felt that in their contemplated Pakistan, Muslims alone would be allowed to remain, Gandhiji thought he must say that it was something un-Islamic. Islam, he said, was based on the fundamental principle of democracy and toleration of other faiths. If any individual, be he Hindu or Muslim or Christian, disobeyed the fundamental basis of others’ religion, it was he who fell, and not the religion. If Pakistan meant anything more, the speaker did not know; and if it did, so far as he knew, it would make no appeal to his reason.
 The second question was: “How did your ahimsa work in Bihar?”
 Gandhiji said that it did not work at all. It failed miserably. But, if the reports received by him from responsible quarters were to be relied upon, the Bihar Government was making full amends and the general population in Bihar also had realized the heinousness of the crimes committed by large masses of Biharis in certain portions of that Province.
 One of the Bihar Ministers came to Noakhali with the promise from the Bihar Government that they would spare no pains for rehabilitating the people. Gandhiji said he was receiving letters and resolutions passed by the Muslim League and he was conversant with the case referred to by them. He sent every case for immediate attention and thorough investigation by the Bihar Government. To the Bihar Government Gandhiji had suggested the setting up of an impartial tribunal to enquire into the happenings and the Bihar Government had promised to abide by its findings in toto.libtech_626_footnote
 The third question was: “Why are you silent about the eviction of Bengalis by
 
 the Assam Government?”
 Gandhiji said that he was not deliberately silent. The question was not new for him. Gandhiji said that he had it in his programme during his last visit to Assam. So far as his information went, Assam Government’s objection was to those who had settled in different parts of that Province without permission of the Assam Government.libtech_627_footnote
 When some years ago he went to Assam he was taken to the very spot where Muslims from Mymensingh had migrated and taken possession of vacant lands. He had then given his opinion and held it even now that it was not open to persons to usurp vacant land wherever it may be, that is, whether in their own Province or in another. For him it was not a Hindu-Muslim question. What he had said was of universal application. If Assam attempted to evict lawful possessors, it would be guilty of crime against humanity. What he had heard was quite the contrary. But if there was a question of unlawful eviction, the Assam Government would not be above law and it was open also to the Bengal Government to vindicate the position of evicted Bengalis, here happening to be Muslims.
 Gandhiji said that if the friends here had another tale to narrate he was ready to hear it. Most he could do was to advise the Assam Ministry to set up an impartial commission of inquiry as in Bihar and refer the whole subject to it. As a matter of fact the present Ministry of Assam was pursuing a policy chalked out by the Ministry previously in office.libtech_628_footnote
 The next question was: “What in your opinion is the cause of communal
 riots?”
 Gandhiji said that in his opinion the riots were due to the idiocy of both the
 communities.libtech_629_footnote
 No one party could create a riot, he said, if the other party remained non- violent and honest. Referring to the recent outbreaks in Bombay and other places, Gandhiji said he had seen how an “eye-for-an-eye and a tooth-for-a-tooth” policy had been pursued to its bitter end in these places. One day one Muslim was stabbed and the following day a Hindu was found stabbed and vice versa. What else could it be called, Gandhiji asked. It was the same outlook that lay at the root of all communal riots. Gandhiji asked :
We are children of the same soil and have the same origin and if
 any of my brothers provoked me to commit some evil act, why shall I submit to him? If anybody tried to force a change of religion or if
 
 
 anyone tried to molest a woman, why should he or she submit before this brute force?
 He added it was incumbent upon anyone to court death non-violently in resisting such force. How long would an oppressor continue in acts of violence if he found non-violent people who were determined to face death instead of surrendering? Retaliation, according to Gandhiji, was not the remedy and it was non-violence alone which could counteract wrong and put an end to the madness that was inherent in communal riots.
 The fifth question was: “Do you think that you would be successful in bringing peace to Noakhali without having it at the Centre?”
 Gandhiji replied that if by the Centre was meant a pact between Jinnah Saheb, President of the Muslim League and Acharya Kripalani, President of the Indian National Congress, he certainly held that such a pact was not necessary in order to bring about harmonious relations between the Hindus and the Muslims in Noakhali. So far as he knew neither the President of the Congress nor the President of the Muslim League desired discord between the two. They had their political quarrel. But the disturbances in India whether in Bengal, Bihar or elsewhere were insensate and hindered political progress. He, therefore, felt that it was open to the Hindus and the Muslims in Noakhali to behave like men and cultivate peaceful relations among themselves.
 The last question was: “Who according to your opinion have saved the Hindus and Hindu property in Noakhali? Do you not think that Muslim neighbours saved them?”
 Gandhiji replied that the question assumed a subtle pride. What was wanted was   a spirit of humility and repentance that there were enough Muslims found in Noakhali who had lost their heads to the extent of committing loot, arson and murder and resorting to forcible conversions, etc. If more mischief was not done, God alone was to be thanked, not man. At the same time the speaker was free to confess that be it said to their honour, there were Muslims who afforded protection to Hindus.

         DALTA, 
  January 	23, 1947  Gandhiji 	announced that the Chowdharis of the village had decided to give him 	the plot 	of ground 	on which 	the meeting 	was being 	held. He 	congratulated the 	Chowdharis on 	their generous action. 	The gift 	to him 	carried no 	meaning beyond that 	it was presented for 	public use 	irrespective of 	caste or 	party. Naturally there 	would be a proper 	document setting out the 	grant. He 	hoped that the 	donors would carry out 	the full purpose of 	the gift. 	The further 	cause for congratulation 	was that 	he was 	accom- modated 	in the 	house of Rai 	Mohan Mali. He did 	not consider himself to 	belong to 	any caste. 	He belonged 	to the lowest 	rung of the Hindu 	ladder. In reality 	there was no 	ladder; no high, no low. All were equal in the eyes of God as of law. It was a happy    
 conjunction of events that it happened to be Netaji’s birthday. What could be happier than that the Chowdharis should make their gift on this day and that a Scheduled Class friend, Rai Mohan Mali, should provide him habitation? In the speaker’s opinion the great and most lasting act of Netaji was that he abolished all distinctions of caste and class. He was not a mere Hindu, nor a mere Bengali; he never thought of himself as a caste Hindu. He was Indian first and last. What was more, he fired all under him with the same zeal so that they forgot in his presence all distinctions and acted as one man.
 No doubt there was much else to be credited to Netaji. Thus he had sacrificed a brilliant career for the sake of the country’s service and enlisted himself under the late Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das. He suffered various imprisonments, twice became President of the Congress and at last by great strategy gave the slip to the guard put over him by the then Government of Bengal and by sheer courage and resourcefulness reached Kabul and passed through European countries and finally found himself in Japan, collected from scattered material an army of brilliant young men drawn from all communities and from all parts of India and dared to give battle to a mighty Government. A lesser man would have succumbed under the trials that Netaji went through; but he in his life verified the saying of Tulsidas that “all becomes right for the brave”.
 Gandhiji ended by saying that the Hindus should progress by forgetting all distinctions of caste and both the communities should develop unity of heart. He was reminded of a saying of the Prophet in which it was said that a man would be judged on the Day of Judgment not by what he professed by his lips, nor by whom he followed, but by what he had himself done to implement the teachings received by him.

 MY DEAR KUMARAPPA,
 Whilst preparations are being made to massage me, I want to devote a few minutes to letters about things with which I am intimately connected. Yesterday I wrote to Aryanayakam. Today it is your turn.
 How is the village work flourishing? Are all kindred activities correlated with one another? Or is there still the jarring note? The work I am doing here is the most difficult of all I have hitherto undertaken and I know that those who are working for the country take an effective part in the work here if they do their best in their respective spheres. The village work that has been your lot can contribute probably the most to the fruition of what is being done
 here. At the same time I know that it is the most uphill work, as I find walking from village to village and putting before them sanitation, the spinning-wheel, weaving and the craft peculiar to the particular village. They listen, nod, assent but beyond that they will not go. Add to this the local differences and troubles.

 volunteer corps of about twelve hundred strong to defend the area from an onslaught of communal riots. Gandhiji remarked :
I heard of Hashnabad some time ago as the bright spot of
Hindu-Muslim unity during the riot period.
 The interviewers then told him of a food cricis developing in that area and asked him if he would say something about it in his speeches so as to draw the attention of the Bengal Government. Gandhiji replied :
 Though I am not saying anything about the coming food crisis, I am aware of the situation. I am trying to solve it in my own way. I do not see why the people should depend upon Government or other agencies for help. We hear nowadays of people trying to secure foodstuffs from foreign countries. As a matter of fact if people will help themselves, then the Government is bound to move and this is what I will call real democracy, which is built up from below. Bengal possesses rich lands. They can produce edible roots. But again it is difficult to induce people to revise their tastes and old habits. Look at these coconut trees. Coconut makes a good nutritious food. I am trying to accustom myself to it. Of course, I extract the oil from it and the remaining portion as you know, contains good protein. Then take the many kinds of roots in the soil of Bengal which belong to the potato tribe and these can be used as good food. Then again, you have abundance of fish. Fish, coconuts and these roots can easily take the place of rice.
 Incidentally Gandhiji mentioned the general supineness of the people. As an instance he mentioned the water hyacinth which, if the people en masse volunteered their services for a week without any aid from Government, they could get rid of within a week’s time, causing a saving of thousands of rupees.
 Gandhiji was asked his opinion about the Tebhaga Movementlibtech_639_footnotein Bengal. Gandhiji confessed his ignorance about the movement and asked for a note on the subject which the questioners have undertaken to supply.
 QUESTION: Can we not build up Hindu-Muslim unity through a concrete political programme?
GANDHIJI: Probably you can. But I have got my own ways. I
 think if people help themselves, then politics will take care of themselves.
 
  
 you.

         MURIYAM, 
  January 24, 1947 Gandhiji began by saying that he felt much pleasure in being housed in a Muslim libtech_641_footnotelibtech_642_footnotehouse. He and his party had received every attention. The Muslim friends  went 	so far 	as to find 	a maidan 	large enough to hold 	the largest 	number of 	visitors possible. 	And it 	so happened that 	the meeting 	was the largest 	of all 	during his 	pilgrimage. He 	attributed the largeness 	of the meeting 	to the fast of Bibi Amtussalaam 	which had a 	happy ending because of 	the sincere 	labours of Abdullah 	Saheb and 	his assistance and 	that of the 	leading Muslims of 	the villages 	concerned. Whether 	his inference 	was justified 	or not, 	he flattered 	himself with the belief 	he had 	expressed.  He 	was sorry 	that there was poison 	administered to the 	public by 	some newspapers. 	Newspapers today had almost replaced the Bible, the Koran, the Gita 	and the other 	religious scriptures. It was wrong but the fact had to be faced. 	Such being the case, 	he held 	it to be the 	duty of 	newspapermen to 	give nothing but 	facts to 	their readers.  He 	was also 	of opinion 	that the 	movement of 	minorities to 	the majority 	provinces was 	an impracticable 	proposition. He knew 	the time 	when the late 	two Imam 	brotherslibtech_643_footnoteand the late 	Mazharul Haqlibtech_644_footnoteSaheb led both the 	communities and 	the leading 	Hindus, such as 	the late Brajkishore 	Prasad and Dr. Rajendra 	Prasad gladly worked 	under them.

It 	was true that some 	Bihar Hindus had 	acted inhumanly 	but that 	aberration ought not to 	deflect the Muslims 	from their clear duty 	bravely to 	stick to 	their homes which were 	theirs by 	right. And 	the Bihari Hindus had 	to make 	all possible 	amends for the misdeeds 	of the Hindus 	who had become 	insane. He would 	say the same 	to Noakhali 	Hindus and Muslims. 	It was 	therefore a 	good omen that there were 	Muslims in the 	village to 	harbour him.

 January 25, 1947 Gandhiji first drew attention to the fact that the tallibtech_657_footnotegiven was out of tune. He suggested that all they did in the name of God should be in tune. If they were out of
 tune outside, they were likely to be out of tune  within.   He  then   alluded  to   two
 telegrams received from the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam in Madras and Bombay respectively. They said that he, an unbeliever, had no right to interfere in the Islamic Law. He submitted that the telegrams were based on ignorance of facts. He had not interfered at all in the practice of religion. He had neither the right nor the wish to do so. All he had done was to tender advice and that based on his reading of the Prophet’s sayings, etc. What was more, he had observed in many cultured Muslim families total
 
 disregard of the purdah as it is observed today. But that did not signify  less  observance of the purdah of the heart, which was the reality, in his opinion, aimed at by Islam. Whatever it was, it was open to the Muslim hearers to reject his advice if they felt that it was in conflict with the tenets of Islam. The critical telegrams received by him betrayed, in his opinion, grave intolerance of other opinion than that of the critics. Let them not forget that the courts of law including the Privy Council, which were often composed of non-Muslims, interpreted the Islamic Law and imposed its interpretation on the Islamic world. He, on the contrary, sought merely to give an opinion. If he could not do so for fear of criticism or even physical punishment, he would be an unworthy representative of non-violence and truth.

          CHI. 	MANILAL,       January 	26, 1947 
  	I am reaching your letter somewhat late. But it is difficult to 	attend to outside work in the midst of a tour in the course of which 	I keep on moving from one village to another every day.      
 Why did Dr. Bhagawat have to give up that diet? Has he also accepted defeat? I do not, of course, suggest by this that, if he has not accepted defeat, he should resume the whole food experiment. One should eat only such food as helps one to keep good health. If Datar refuses to put up the building, is anybody else willing to do so? Discuss the matter with the people there and let me know. Does Datar permit the use of his bungalow? Or does he seem reluctant to do so? You should not trouble Jehangirji in regard to shortage of funds. If needed, you may call for an additional five thousand from  the  Ashram. Ultimately, however, the expenditure on that place will have to be found by the village. If it cannot be done, we will have to consider whether we should stay on there permanently. We shall not succeed in propagating nature cure in villages by obtaining money from outside. I am certainly not unaware of the fact that Dr. Dinshaw is not able to attend to village work. This need not frighten you. There will be no harm if the Trust is made into a sub-trust of the Poona Trust, nor if it is made an independent one. However, even if it is a sub-trust, it must include some residents of the village. We should also ascertain what the residents themselves desire.
 I am glad that Gangabehn pays occasional visits to the place. Will the lady whom Appa Saheb has sent stay there permanently? Has she become friendly with the other women? I was happy to learn that Gokhale had calmed down still further. Can you say that Purushottam had been fully restored? I hope Paramanand’s eczema has been completely cured. I should advise him to get married immediately, for it is most uncertain when I shall be able to leave here. It is indeed a question whether I shall return alive from the place. The best course, therefore, would be to go through the marriage immediately. As far as  I understand, this marriage is not intended to be a means of pleasure. This is not the time for such marriages. I believe that it is intended as a help in self-control. If my assumption is correct, it need not matter where I am.
 The problem of the well seems to be a difficult one. If a deep well can be successfully, sunk, it will be a great achievement. But such efforts do not always succeed. You have written that you are going to
 think over it further. It will be good, however, if the Government people guide you in your  deliberations in the matter.  Ask Morarjibhai.

461,"January 26, 1947",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
         BANSA, 
  January 26, 1947 Today is 	the 26th of January, the day of our freedom. When Congress was born, 	India obtained a  new lease of life. Only  a   few Indians 	at the time were aware of the political significance of this, but  	gradually the Congress grew strong and it awakened freedom- 	consciousness in every village by starting mass agitation. In the 	days when there was no communal hatred no one cared whether  a  	person    
 was a Hindu or a Muslim. It is a sad thing to have to say that there are two opinions now where there was only one before. But for the poisoned atmosphere prevalant here, I would have unfurled the tricolour flag myself. Some friends suggested that I should perform the ceremony, but I refused. Had an English officer, however, decreed that there should be no flag-hoisting here, I would certainly have unfurled the flag, even if it cost my life. But to whom may I appeal today. Suppose I unfurled the flag and even my Muslim brothers accepted it but in sullen silence, I would not want that. At the same time, I must say what is in my heart. When the question of our having  a flag of our own came up, I thought it unjust to have only one colour for it, as there are not one but many communities in India. A day there certainly was, when all the communities of India—Hindu, Muslim, Parsi and others—cherished this flag as their own. Even lives were sacrificed for it. Today many flags have come into being. But the tricolour should stand alone as the Union Jack did at one time. But that golden day of unity unfortu- nately now belongs to the past. But to whom shall I appeal. With whom shall I fight? We are all sons of India and hence are brothers. What is our freedom worth if it accentuates internecine strife and hatred? But proclaiming unity is as absurd as building castles in the air.
 There can be only one call at present that we shall not rest till freedom is won. Today brother is fighting brother. How can there be a Pakistan before we win our freedom? Is it the British who will grant Pakistan? And who knows what kind of freedom we shall have? The Britisher is certain to quit. But America and Russia are not yet out of the picture. If we are not alert we are lost. Only a little while ago you all sang “Jana-gana-mana”. What an ennobling song! And we have many such. We can be united if we but sing them sincerely, from the heart. And if we don’t unite we shall be considered fools by the rest of the world. If you feel at heart that you should heed this warning of an old, experienced man, you must start from today to change your thoughts and deeds in accordance with my advice.
 I did not unfurl the flag today but the Pressmen  with  me unfurled it. It was for this same freedom that that great man of Bengal, Subhas Chandra Bose, laid down his life. If even for his sake we can’t perform the yajna, for whom shall we do it?

462,"January 27, 1947",A WOMAN’S DILEMMA,"
    
 Q. What is a woman to do when attacked by miscreants—run away or resist with violence? Have boats in readiness to fly or prepare to defend with weapons?
A. My answer to this question is very simple. For me there can
 be no preparation for violence. All preparation must be for non- violence if courage of the highest type is to be developed. Violence can only be tolerated as being preferable always to cowardice. Therefore I would have no boats ready for flight in emergency. For a non-violent person there is no emergency but quiet dignified preparation for death. Hence whether it is a man or a woman he or she will defy death even when he or she is unassisted; for the  real assistance is from God. I can preach no other thing and I am here to practise what I preach. Whether such an opportunity will come to me or be given to me I do not know. If there are women who when assailed by miscreants cannot resist without arms they do not need to be advised to carry arms. They will do so. There is something wrong in this constant enquiry as to whether to bear arms or not. People have to learn to be naturally independent. If they will remember the central teaching, namely, that the real effective resistance lies in non-violence, they will model their conduct accordingly. And that is what the world has been doing although unthinkingly. Since it has not the highest courage, namely courage born of non-violence, it arms itself even unto the atom bomb. Those who do not see in it  the  futility  of violence will naturally arm themselves to the best of their ability.
 In India, since my return from South Africa, there has been conscious and constant training in non-violence with the result we have seen.
 Q.	Can a woman be advised to take her own life rather than surrender?
 A. This question requires a definite answer. I answered it in Delhi just before leaving for Noakhali. A woman should  most certainly take her own life rather than surrender. In other words, surrender has no room in my plan of life. But I was asked in what way to take one’s own life. I promptly said it was not for me to prescribe the means and behind the approval of suicide under such  circumstances was and is the belief that one whose mind is prepared for even suicide will have requisite courage for such mental resistance and such internal purity that her assailant will be disarmed. I could not carry the argument any further because it does not admit of further development. It requires positive proof which, I own, is lacking.
 Q.	If the choice is between taking one’s own life or that of the assailant, which would you advise?
A. When it is a question of choice between killing oneself or
 the assailant, I have no doubt in my mind that the first should be the choice.

 DEAR FRIEND,
This is in answer to your question.
  It 	is a fact 	that I was 	hurt at 	the behaviour 	of many 	Muslims who 	sat out during 	the prayer 	and left 	when  I  commenced  my 	address.  I 	did say that 	I could 	not give 	up Ramanama 	at the 	bidding of 	any person 	or even 	if the 	kingdom of 	the world 	was offered 	to me; 	for Ramanama 	was to me the same 	as Allah, 	Khuda or God.  I 	do hold that 	the God of 	Hindus, Muslims, 	Christians, Parsees, 	Jews and others 	is one 	and the same, no 	matter by 	what name 	a votary 	mentions Him 	or recognizes 	Him. The 	idea is 	not my 	own. But 	I have learnt to believe that it is universal.  I 	do believe 	that all religions 	have equal status 	and that they 	are like 	leaves of the 	same tree. No 	two leaves 	are identical 	though they 	are from 	the same source.  It 	is a fact 	that in my daily 	prayers the Gita, 	the Koran 	and the 	other religious texts 	find place. 	You have but to 	procure a 	copy of 	the prayer 	book published by 	the Navajivan 	Press, Ahmedabad 	and others 	to find 	what they are. Nothing is 	my composition.  My 	religion embraces 	Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, etc., for 	the simple 	reason that I believe 	them to have 	an equal 	status. It is not a 	combination sweet or otherwise. Every religion has its own place even 
 
 as every leaf has. If I believe in the equal status of all the leaves of a tree, it is not a combination of my make but a recognition of a scientific fact.

  January 27, 1947 I am really happy that I am staying 	with a Harijan weaver. He  looks after me with such love and care! A 	place where love is not is a prison; 	and a hut where love abides is more than a palace. The fact is  	that I am charmed with all these huts of Bengal. How can you get 	light and air in a closed room? The tragedy is that while the style 	of living here is so simple and Nature has lavished her gifts so 	abundantly the Hindus and Muslims here do not treat one another as 	brothers. Shall we debase ourselves simply because our creeds 	differ? But I have every hope that we shall forget all this very 	soon and understand our responsibilities. Even now shops continue to 	remain closed in areas affected by the riots, and people look at 	each other with suspicion. But this harms only ourselves and no one 	is the gainer. On the one hand there is danger of a famine from 	failure of crops on the other we are harming ourselves by our 	ignorance and inertia. We are only digging    
 our own graves if we continue to behave as we are doing now.
 There are so many things we can do without troubling the Government. We can easily do many things ourselves; for instance, improving general health and sanitation, insisting on cleanliness, cultivating fresh fruit and flower plants, making good manure and compost, etc. Several such matters are awaiting our attention. If we use our brains to this end what a stupendous gain it will be to us all! And I guarantee that then we will not have a moment to spare for quarrels. But we can attain this happy state only if we have wisdom. It is my constant prayer that God may grant us good sense as this girl here has just been singing and endow us with the strength to do things purposeful.

 January 28, 1947
 Sardar Niranjan Singh Gill has told me of all the talk he had with you. He says whilst you do not mind his men working  in Noakhali you would doubt his bona fide until he with his men worked in Bihar just as assiduously as in Noakhali. In the circumstances I have told him that he should first go to Bihar and work there and in order to be able to do so effectively he should take from you a notelibtech_667_footnotelibtech_668_footnoteof recommendation to the leader in Bihar of the League Party. Unless he is so armed, I have told him, his work might, from the League point of view, fall flat. I added that he should keep himself in touch with you regarding his work there.
 As to his work in Noakhali, I have told him that, regard being had to your views as interpreted by the Sardar, he should withdraw his men from Noakhali unless you approved of his work in Noakhali. It is not enough that you tolerate his men’s work. It should have your written approval. His men can only be here as accepted friends of both Hindus and Muslims. I cannot entertain them on  any  other terms. I have told him too that he should find financial support not from private sources, including funds at my disposal, but should, in
 
 order to be above board, depend upon open public  support. Therefore I have suggested to him too that, if you approve of his activity here, you should subscribe to his appeal even if it be a token rupee. But there may be difficulty in this of which I could have no knowledge even though you might approve of his  activity  in Noakhali.

     KAZIRKHIL, 	RAMGANJ P.S., NOAKHALI DISTT.,  January 	28, 1947  DEAR 	FRIEND,  	I am sorry. I reached your letter only today. In the constant 	movement I feel called upon to do from day to day the letter was 	mislaid and it was discovered yesterday by chance in my unassorted 	and undocketed papers whilst I was searching for another document. 	From the trend of my answer you will see that nothing has been lost     
 by the delay for which I must hold myself responsible.
 You have done well to give me your views briefly. Having had such views before me often enough I have no difficulty in giving you my reply.
  I 	do not 	think that leaflets and 	pamphlets can 	do any 	good at the present 	moment. Unfortunately 	for the country 	those who have 	any influence 	over the masses 	have already 	made up 	their minds and 	closed them 	against any 	criticism. In 	such a 	state of 	society I 	feel that 	the kind of 	activity you 	suggest must 	fall flat. You should 	know also that such an attempt has been madelibtech_673_footnotelibtech_674_footnotebefore and is even now being made, 	in my opinion 	without producing any 	appreciable effect.  A 	volunteer corps 	such as you 	have in 	view could not 	be formed. 	If by any 	chance it 	is formed its 	effort will 	be discounted. 	Before that 	happy time 	comes it 	is necessary for 	each party 	or community 	to form 	its own corps 	of sincere 	Muslims and Hindus 	who will 	work for peace without 	any mental 	reservations. Out 	of such 	a band 	of selfless 	workers of Hindus 	and Muslims 	a combined 	corps is 	bound to 	come into being. 	Unfortunately we 	have not 	such men 	in any 	appreciable measure.  I 	doubt if 	there are 	many Muslim 	missionaries. But 	if there 	are even a 	few, there 	is nothing 	to prevent 	them from 	doing this valuable 	mission work. You say it 	is necessary to 	secure such service. 	My experience covering 	a period 	of sixty 	years tells me 	otherwise. Such 	services are not 	secured. They are 	freely given.  Of 	course it 	is possible to organize 	a volunteer 	corps of 	Muslims only. 	The pity of it is that 	it has 	not been done up to now 	in a proper 	friendly manner.  I 	have already 	said that a 	combination will 	be premature. 	Of course 	I have 	no knowledge 	of what 	the Congress organization 	is doing 	here and indeed 	elsewhere except 	such knowledge as 	is of no use 	being vague. I 	hope you 	realize your suggestions 	do not 	require money but men and women of the right type. Are they available ?

DEPUTATIONlibtech_675_footnote","
    
 PANCHGAON,
 January 28, 1947
 I have come here with the greatest goodwill in the world. I know if I fail in Noakhali my whole non-violence fails.
 Gandhiji said that he had always been a man of the masses and a man for the masses and he wanted to identify himself completely with the masses. If they could tell him the way how he could reach more effectively the hearts of Muslims, he was ready to listen. But on no account could he leave Noakhali.
 So far as others working in Noakhali were concerned it was the duty of the Government to find out if they were really standing in the way of restoration of peace.
 Referring to the question of his going to Bihar, Gandhiji said that he knew that it was the opinion of the Muslim League circles that he should go to Bihar. He was, however, doing his best for the Muslims of Bihar from Noakhali. He was in constant touch with the Bihar Government in this respect and a representative of that Government was now travelling with him. If he went now to Bihar and found that the Bihar Government had left nothing undone, he would have to say it without any reserve which in his opinion might not help the Muslim League case.
 With reference to the question of large-scale arrests of Muslims here, Gandhiji said that the duty of a reformer was to try to replace corporal punishment by awakening of the conscience. He had tried to do it in his life and succeeded though not
 
 in many cases. Their duty also should be to try to awaken this conscience so that culprits would come forward and own up their guilt. So long as this was not done, the ring-leaders should be arrested.
 With regard to conducting of prayers, Gandhiji said that if there was so much intolerance that one could not hold one’s prayers as one liked he did not know what lay in store for poor India. It was at the request of a devout Muslim friend that he had included verses from the Koran in his prayer. Of course, he never wanted to go against the tenets of Islam but he could not also listen to one particular person or half a dozen persons to whom they might refer him as to whether he was going against Islam by reciting from the Koran.

         PANCHGAON, 
  January 28, 1947 On my way 	here I was taken to three homes, one Hindu and two Muslim. It gave 	me very great pleasure as all I crave for is love. I was not 	informed in advance of the places I would be taken to, but I saw  	love in the eyes of those who invited me, and so I went. At all the 	three places I was offered something or other to eat, but it was not 	the time when I usually ate, so I said I would gladly accept some 	fruit if they sent any to my next halt. My granddaughter accompanies 	me. The women welcomed her with love and an old lady embraced her on 	knowing who she was. A Muslim sister who had made fish curry and 	rotis at the time, pressed her to partake of the fare. What was the 	poor girl to do? She refused the offer on the ground that she did 	not take anything at that early hour. The Muslim women thereupon 	suspected that this Hindu girl was not willing to eat, because at 	heart she felt she would be polluted. So, to allay their suspicion, 	she broke a piece from their roti and ate it. The sisters were 	satisfied. Neither I nor those who associate with me make any 	distinctions of caste or creed and we have no inhibitions against 	dining with anybody. But I appeal to my Muslim friends to look 	kindly upon those Hindus who think they would lose their religion if 	they ate at the hands of a Muslim. I understand that that belief is 	wrong. But the test of brotherly love does not lie only in eating 	together. This erroneous belief is sure to wear off with time. Much 	has been achieved already in this direction. But till that attitude 	changes please learn to appreciate love wherever you find it. Only 	in this way will you come near one another. 
 The Pressmen who follow me had arranged a mass dinner of all castes and creeds. Muslim brothers did not join in it. But the host of the Pressmen begged them earnestly not to insist on his participation in the common dinner. ‘You will leave me in a day’, he said ‘but calamity will beset me after you go. The people here will bring pressure to bear upon me saying that I had lost caste by eating with you and so I must become a Muslim.
 I felt that the man’s fear was well founded. So I had to request the Pressmen not to hold the common dinner in the poor man’s hut. I don’t know when Hindus and Muslims will shed their weakness and come close to one another. But I am prepared to give up my very life, if need be, to see this object realized, and I appeal to you all to pray with me: “O! God ! bring that golden day soon.”

  January 29, 1947 Gandhiji at the outset dealt with a question that was raised by some Muslim friends. Did he want Muslims to attend his prayer meetings? The reply was that he  insisted on neither the Muslims nor the Hindus attending the prayer meetings. If the    
 questioner meant to ask whether he would like the Muslims to attend such meetings, he had no hesitation in saying that he would certainly like them to attend. What was more, numerous Muslims had attended his prayer meetings which had gone on for years. The next question was whether he, the speaker, did not consider it wrong for him, a non-Muslim, to recite anything from the Koran or to couple Rama and Krishna with Rahim and Karim. They said it offended Muslim ears. The speaker replied that the objection gave him a painful surprise. He thought that the objection betrayed narrowness of mind. They should know that he had introduced the recital from the Koran through Raihana Tyabjee, a devoted Muslim with a religious mind. She had no political motive behind the proposal. He was no avatar as was suggested. He claimed to be a man of God humbler than the humblest man or woman. His object ever was to make Muslims better Muslims, Hindus better Hindus, Christians better Christians, Parsis better Parsis. He never invited anybody to change his or her religion. He had thought, therefore, that the questioners would be glad to find that his religion was so expansive as to include readings from the religious scriptures of the world.
 The next thing was that some friends had said that all prosecutions initiated by the Hindus against the Muslim offenders interfered with the progress of the work of peace between the two. It surprised him. What had peace between gentlemen to do with the prosecution of criminals. He could understand the objection if it meant that false prosecutions should be withdrawn. He would be whole-heartedly with the objectors. He went further and said that all such persons should be brought to book as perjurers. He said also that the proper course to avoid court procedure was for the guilty persons in all humility to make an open confession of their guilt and accept the judgment of the public. He would gladly help any such movement.
 The third thing was that young men who had gone to Calcutta and other places in search of a career were bound to give a portion of their time to the villages. The easiest thing for them to do would be to meet together and make an arrangement by which, say, half of them would take leave from office and serve for a stipulated number of months, at the end of which their place would be taken by the next batch. If they had a will, there would surely be some way also for serving the cause of the villagers. Those who did not find it possible to offer personal service might help by cash.
 Gandhiji ended by citing the example of England, Russia and other countries where every family had sent as many able-bodied men and women as possible for the defence of their country. This was how unity of heart was actually achieved in the world and he hoped that we in our country would be able to rise above small selfish considerations and create that unity without which life itself would not be worth living.

476,"January 30, 1947",FOREWORD TO “SELECTIONS FROM GANDHI”,"
    
 The following pages represent a labour of love. Professor Nirmal Kumar Bose first published his selections in 1934libtech_677_footnoteand  they contained extracts from my writings up to 1934. But my writings have never ceased and so the Professor felt that he should bring up his selections to as late a date as possible, i. e., up to 1942 with isolated later additions. Though therefore this is called a new edition, it is in reality a new book. The earliest and most elaborate attempt was made by the late Amulakhrai in Gujarati. But that was years ago. He covered my writings in Gujarati and Hindi too. The volumes being in Gujarati never attracted much attention. Such is our disregard of our own languages. But I have known nothing so thorough of its kind as these volumes.
 Professor N. K. Bose’s is such an attempt. He gave me his manuscript early in 1946 when I was in Bengal to do with it what I liked. But my preoccupations left me no time to look at them till for very shame I was compelled to do so. The selections made by the author show the thoroughness with which he has gone into his subject. Those who are interested in my writings will not fail to appreciate the author’s labours.

 In my wandering I did not find that there is any inclination on the part of the sufferers to go out of Bengal. Nor do I think it wise. For it they cannot, out of fright, return to their village homes, they will all be accommodated in other parts of Bengal. A large number are already in Assam. Some have gone to Bihar because there is a large Bengali settlement there. My own effort is to send them to  their villages, to make them shed all fear and to dissuade them from forsaking their ancestral homes. Nevertheless, if there are any who would like to go to Katni, of which there seems to be no likelihood, I would of course bear Shri Bhargava’s offer in mind.

  January 30, 1947 Gandhiji began by apologizing for the fifteen minutes’ delay. It was due to his  having been occupied with Zaman Saheb and Yusuf Saheb. These officers took him to  a model cottage they had had erected. It was a good house but in his opinion unfit for     
 human habitation in the Indian climate. Such a house could well be described as a box. The inmates would be baked as in an oven and they would be suffocated when they closed their doors and windows as had become their habit. He, therefore, suggested comfortable cottage of bamboo, straw and thatch. Such cottages will be airy, cool and artistic in the Indian setting, especially in the midst of stately palms of coconut and supari.
 He was also pleased when these officers informed him that the refugees had commenced to return from the places where they had taken refuge. He hoped that this return would continue with unabated zeal. He was of opinion that the people should dismiss all fear from their minds and feel safe in the midst of their own countrymen, whether Hindus or Muslims. When they learnt to fear their Maker alone they would cease to fear their fellows. They would find that there were none to frighten them if they were not afraid themselves. This had been his uniform experience in the course of the last sixty years of his life.
 The third question taken up by him was in connection with some fishermen who had met him on the previous evening. They had complained that in this country where fishing was confined to privately owned ponds for the major part of the year, it was impossible for them to live if they were boycotted by the majority community. Gandhiji expressed his surprise at this state of affairs and suggested that unless the Hindus and Muslims could rise above their present political differences and reasserted their common humanity and common brotherhood, life would become  an impossibility where nature had designed otherwise. He hoped, therefore, that the alleged conditions would be corrected by the joint efforts of the people concerned and real peace restored in the countryside.

  January 	31, 1947  An 	old lady asked Gandhiji what they should do in case they were 	threatened with conversion.  Gandhiji 	said that to him the answer was simple :  	Religion is the breath of one’s life and as no one could agree to 	forgo the right of breathing under any threat or compulsion, so no 	one should forsake his faith even if it be an alternative to death.  Be 	it man or woman, if 	one forsook one’s faith 	at anyone’s 	command, one had 	no religion. 	Unfortunately, Gandhiji continued, India 	had come to such 	a stage 	that some 	Indians easily abandoned 	their supposedly cherished faith. Religion was 	one’s breath of 	life. If 	anyone agreed to 	forgo his religion 	under threat, 	he would 	reduce himself 	to a brute.libtech_687_footnote  One 	of them asked what a woman, whose husband had turned a recluse, 	should do. Gandhiji said : Such 	a woman should lead a very chaste life. She should work  	for her livelihood. She should not hoard anything but only keep that 	which is absolutely necessary. It is wrong to assume that a person 	is a true hermit simply because he wears an ochre robe. If the 	desolate woman is at a loss to know what to do, she could take to 	spinning. I have called the spinning-wheel the kamadhenu. She 	should also chant God’s name as she spins. In my opinion this type 	of renunciation will surpass that of her husband. She should 	constantly keep herself occupied in altruistic work such as sweeping 	the village streets, giving bath to dirty children, etc. There is a 	proverb saying an idle mind is the devil’s workshop. There must be 	a similar proverb in Bengali. If we sit idle, doing nothing, a 	thousand unhealthy thoughts will crowd our mind. So one should never 	be without some sort of work at all times. This is the best solution 	for the problem.  The 	Sunday Hindustan Standard, 2-2-1947; 	and Eklo Jane Re, p. 	110               "

NABAGRAM,
  January 	31, 1947  Gandhiji 	congratulated the 	audience, which 	was exceptionally 	large, on 	the perfect 	quiet they observed 	throughout the 	prayer. He 	then referred 	to two communications he 	had received 	from Muslim 	writers who consoled 	him against 	his critics 	who questioned 	his right 	to speak 	about the purdah 	or  other 	things pertaining to 	Islam. The writers asserted, quoting from the Koran, that Islam was 	broad-based and was 	exceptionally tolerant. 	It welcomed 	criticism and invited 	the world 	to study 	the Koran. 	One of them 	also held that no group 	or nation 	had remained 	without a prophet 	or teacher. 	He mentioned 	these communications to 	show that all 	Muslims did 	not hold what 	he considered 	to be intolerant 	views. He 	hoped too 	that the 	audience which 	contained a 	large number of 	Muslims would appreciate 	the testimony 	of the 	two writers who did not 	appear to be biased.  He 	then dealt with the following question addressed to him by some of 	the workers :  The 	Muslims were boycotting Hindu artisans and craftsmen and were taking 	to occupations like fishing, fir trade, panlibtech_689_footnotecultivation, etc. 	Workers who desired to bring about peace between the two communities 	did not know what to do under the circumstances.  Gandhiji 	said he hoped 	that the news 	was exaggerated 	and that 	the boycott 	was confined 	to the 	fewest Muslims possible. 	He thought 	that it 	could not be 	sustained. The logical 	result was that any such 	move would be 	a compulsory 	exodus of 	the Hindus 	from the Muslim 	majority provinces, a 	result he 	had not heard 	a single 	leader encourage 	or contemplate. 	He invited 	his informants 	to bring 	the matter 	to the 	notice of the 	authorities, not 	with a view 	to having 	anyone punished but with 	a view 	to having 	an authoritative 	pronouncement from them. He 	further advised the 	audience to 	pray for 	wisdom to 	both the communities.  The 	second question was: There is a movementlibtech_690_footnotefor reducing the 	share of the owner from half to one-third of the agricultural 	produce. What is your opinion about this?  Gandhiji 	welcomed the move for the reduction of the landlord’s share from 	half        
 to one-third. He thought the move was substantial.libtech_691_footnoteHe was prepared to go further and concede the entire produce to the tillers of the soil. He believed that no one could claim ownership of land, which belonged to God alone. He further believed that no one who did not till the land had any claim to the produce. Only those who toiled should have a share in the output. But in no case should anybody claim proprietorship of the land itself. The land belonged to the Lord of us all and therefore to the worker on it. But till that ideal state of things came about, the movement towards the reduction of the landlord’s portion was in the right direction. But he warned the people against the use of compulsion or violence. He could have no part or share in violence. It was a reform to be brought about only by the cultivation of healthy public opinion. The reformers must have patience. He believed implicity in the aphorism: ‘As the end so the means’. In his opinion it was pernicious to hold that so long as the end was good any means, however violent or unjust, were justified. Many movements had come to grief by reliance on doubtful means.

But that does not diminish the value of the propositions. Alas I am far as yet from that state ! At the same time, I am hastening towards it.

 Please do not hesitate to write to me or dictate a letter for me whenever you feel like telling me something. Know that your messages will never be a strain on me.
 And now I put before you a poser. A young girl (19) who is in the place of granddaughter to me by relation shares the same bed with me, not for any animal satisfaction but for (to me) valid  moral  reasons. She claims to be free from the passion that a girl of her age generally has and I claim to be a practised brahmachari. Do you see anything bad or unjusti-fiable in this juxtaposition? I ask the question because some of my intimate associates hold it to be wholly unjustifiable and even a breach of brahmacharya. I hold a totally opposite view. As you are an experienced man and as I have regard for your opinion, I put the question. You may take your own time to

493,"February 1, 1947",INTERVIEW TO “THE HINDU”,"
         NABAGRAM, 
  February 1, 1947 I will consider my mission fulfilled 	if I see heart unity among Hindus and Muslims and until this is 	achieved, I must be moving about 	in this area.  Gandhiji 	emphasized to me that this was the first opportunity he had had of 	testing whether the ahimsa he had been practising was really of the 	brave. He said that in the past he had successfully tested the 	efficacy of his non-violence in his struggle with the British 	Government but he felt that his ahimsa was really not of the brave 	as somewhere in the background lurked the feeling that superiority 	in numbers would tend to sway the balance in such a struggle. 	Gandhiji does not think that real bravery has ever been brought into 	full play so far in his practice of ahimsa.  Noakhali, 	Gandhiji said, offered an 	almost ideal situation 	for testing 	whether ahimsa 	could effectively be used by a small number of people against an 	almost sullen   if not 	hostile majority all 	round. The 	problem here 	was also complicated by 	the fact 	of the 	existence of 	a popular 	Government controlling 	the destinies 	of the 	people. Even 	if he differed 	from the politics 	of those 	running the Bengal 	Government he was 	definite that if 	democratic Government was good for one Province it was equally good 	for another and, therefore, he must not do or say anything which would in any way    
 derogate from the prestige and authority of the Government. A straight fight with the alien ruling power was one thing for him, but a struggle with his own countrymen, however recalcitrant unwilling they might be in doing the right thing by those under their care, was a thing too difficult for him to contemplate. It was this difficulty that had induced him to keep the Bengal Premier posted with everything he saw or did in and about Noakhali.
 Ever since the commencement of his walking tour, Gandhiji has been moving amidst a sullen population on the one side and a frightened one on the other. He is, therefore, engaging himself in the dual task of infusing courage into the frightened Hindus and at the same time convincing the majority community of the right to protection of the minorities. He is placing before both communities his ideal of brotherly living and also a programme of sanitation and rural economy calculated to help both communities to better and healthier living.
 Asked if he would regard the return of all refugees to their villages as a sign of success of his ahimsa, Gandhiji replied in the negative and said that it would not be impossible to persuade all refugees to return home within a few days. But this would not be any indication of the success of the ahimsa of the brave; for the refugees would then be relying for protection on those who persuaded them to return. It would be real success if men and women picked up courage and decided of their own accord to return, willing to face cheerfully even death and starvation in preference to surrender or fight.    It was towards achieving this that Gandhiji had been addressing Hindus.

         AMISHAPARA, 
  February 	1, 1947 Gandhiji 	drew the attention of the audience to the fact that the universal 	law applicable 	to all meetings was that the visitors should be perfectly still and 	observe  silence 	no matter how vast the audience was.  Yesterday 	evening a Maulvi had wanted to speak for a short time. Gandhiji had 	sensed what he 	wanted to 	say. He 	therefore, contrary to 	his wont, 	allowed him to 	speak for 	the five minutes which he 	wanted by 	the watch. 	The Maulvi 	took no 	more than 	three minutes but said 	what he had wanted 	to say. 	He resented 	Gandhiji’s remark on 	the purdah 	system in 	vogue in 	Bengal as 	according to 	him, Gandhiji 	had no 	right  to 	speak on 	the Islamic Law.  Gandhiji 	thought this was a 	narrow view 	of religion. 	He claimed 	the right to 	study and 	interpret the 	message of 	Islam. Gandhiji said 	that throughout his 	long life he 	had had the privilege of 	mixing with many. Muslims 	in and out of India 	but he had 	nowhere heard 	anybody say 	that. Denouncing 	the system 	of purdah, 	which varied 	from country 	to country, 	Gandhiji said that he 	was certain 	it had 	little to 	do with the 	Koran. He 	was not inclined 	to believe 	that Islam 	was so 	susceptible to 	damage as 	to be 	confined within a 	narrow space beyond other 	people’s view. Gandhiji was 	sure that 	it was 	contrary to 	Islamic teaching.  The 	Maulvi had further resented coupling of the name of Rama, a mere 	young king, with Rahim, name of God; similarly of Krishna with 	Karim. Gandhiji said this was a narrow view of Islam. This erroneous 	view had emanated from his wrong notion that Rama and Krishna were 	names of ordinary human beings. Man worshipped the same God under 	different names and the Koran was not opposed to it. Rama and      
 Krishna were names of God and there was no bar in worshipping God as such, it certainly did not offend Islam. Islam was not a creed to be preserved in a box. It was open to mankind to examine it and accept or reject its tenets. He hoped that this narrow view was not shared by the Muslims of Bengal or India.
 Purity of heart was the criterion of a religious man but persons who looted other people’s properties, killed fellow-beings and took God’s name at the same time were irreligious. In this connection Gandhiji wanted to draw the attention of the audience to the work. Dr. Sushila Nayyar was doing in Changirgaon. She wanted to go   to Sevagram to attend to the hospital for whose management she was responsible, but her Muslim patients would not let her go till they were restored to health. She had also mentioned that in the village those, who had shared in the loot of October last were of their own accord bringing back some of the looted property. He was of opinion that this was a happy omen. If the infection spread, the courts would have no work to do so far as public loot was concerned. He for one would ask Government to waive the right of prosecution if the looted property was returned. But he said the return must be sincere and full, whether by the guilty one or the public, and not a mere token to avoid prosecution. What he aimed at was a change of heart and not a truce superimposed by the military or the police. A popular ministry could not impose its will on the people. Gandhiji said :
I shall most gladly leave Noakhali when I am certain that all are
 acting with amity and sincerity, but I shall lay down my life here for the fulfilment of my mission.
 Gandhiji then answered the following question :
 You have asked rich men to be trustees. Is it implied that they should give up private ownership of their property and create out of it a trust valid in the eyes of the law and managed democratically? How will the successor of the present incumbent be determined on his demise?
 In answer Gandhiji said that he adhered to the position taken by him years ago that everything belonged to God and was from God. Therefore it was for His people as    a whole, not for a particular individual. When an individual had more than his proportionate portion he became a trustee of that portion for God’s people.
 God who was all-powerful had no need to store. He created from day to day. Hence men also should in theory live day to day and not stock things. If this truth was imbibed by the people generally, it would become legalized and trusteeship would become a legalized institution. He wished it became a gift from India to the world. Then there would be no exploitation and no reserves as in Australia and other countries for white men and their posterity. In these distinctions lay the seeds of a war more virulent than the last two. As to the successor, the trustee in office would have the right to nominate his successor subject to legal sanction.
 Gandhiji referred to “small-talks, whispers and innuendos” going round of which he had become aware. He was already in the midst of so much suspicion and distrust, he told the gathering, that he did not want his most innocent acts to be misunderstood and misrepresented. He had his granddaughter with him. She shared the same bed with him. The Prophet had discounted eunuchs who became such by an operation. But he welcomed eunuchs made such through prayer by God. His was that aspiration. It was in the spirit of God’s eunuch that he had approached what he considered was his duty. It was an integral part of the yajna he was performing and he invited them to bless the effort. He knew that his action had excited criticism even among his friends. But a duty could not be shirked even for the sake of the most intimate friends.

SATGHARIA,
  February 	2, 1947  Gandhiji 	deliberately referred to 	his private 	life because he had 	never thought 	that the 	private life of 	individuals did 	not affect the 	course of 	the public 	activities of those 	individuals. Thus he did 	not believe that he 	could be 	immoral in 	private life and 	yet be 	an efficient public 	servant. His public 	conduct was bound 	to be affected 	by his 	private. He 	held that much mischief 	was made 	throughout the 	world by divorce between 	public and private 	conduct. And when 	he was engaged 	in the supreme 	test of non-violence in 	his life, 	he wished 	to be judged 	before God and man by 	the sum total 	of his 	activities, both 	private and 	public. As 	he had said years ago, 	non-violent life 	was an act of 	self-examination and 	self-purification whether 	by an individual, 	a group 	or a nation.  This 	led him to the answers of some questions addressed to him and 	arising out  of 	his remarks 	on trusteeship.  Q. 	Was it possible to defend 	by means of non-violence anything which could only be gained through 	violence?  A. 	It followed 	from what he had said 	above that what was 	gained by 	violence could 	not only be defended by non-violence but the latter required the 	abandonment of the 	ill-gotten gains.  Q. 	Was the accumulation of  	capital possible  except 	 through  violence 	whether open or 	tacit ?  A. 	Such accumulation by 	private persons was impossible except through violent means but 	accumulation by the State in a non-violent society was not only 	possible, it was desirable and inevitable.  Q. 	Whether a man accumulated 	material or moral wealth he did so only through the help or 	co-operation of other members of society. Had he then the moral 	right to use any of it mainly for personal advantage?  A.	No, 	he had no moral right.  Q. 	How would 	the successor 	of a trustee 	be determined? 	Would he only 	have  the right of proposing a name, the right of finalization vested in the State?  A.	As he had saidlibtech_712_footnotelibtech_713_footnoteyesterday, choice should be given to the original owner       
 who became the first trustee, but the choice must be finalized by the State. Such arrangement puts a check on the State as well as the individual.
 Q. When the replacement of private by public property thus took place through the operation of the theory of trusteeship, would the ownership vest in the State, which was an instrument of violence or in associations of a voluntary character like village communes and municipalities, which might of course derive their final authority from State-made laws?
 A. That question involved some confusion of thought. Legal ownership in  the transformed condition vested in the trustee, not in the State. It was to avoid confiscation that the doctrine of trusteeship came into play retaining for the society the ability of the original owner in his own right. Nor did he, the speaker, hold that the state must always be based on violence. It might be so in theory but the practice of the theory demanded a State which would for the most part be based on non- violence.

         SADHURKHIL, 
  February 	3, 1947  At 	the outset, Gandhiji said 	that what he had said 	about his private 	life was not 	for blind imitation. He never claimed to have extraordinary powers. What he did was    
 for all to do if they conformed to conditions observed by him. If that was not done, those who pretended to imitate his practice were doomed to perdition. What he was doing was undoubtedly dangerous, but it ceased to be so, if the conditions were rightly observed.
 Gandhiji referred with hesitation to the resolution passed by the Muslim Leaguelibtech_721_footnoteon the Constituent Assembly. It considered the Congress resolution to be dishonest and that it did not mean what it said. It was also said that the elections and other dealings of the Assembly were illegal. The speaker pleaded that there should be no imputation of dishonesty by one party to the other. It was not good for the great organization which they both were. There was no reason why they should regard each other as enemies. That practice would not lead them to independence. If the elections and proceedings were illegal their legality should be challenged in a court of law. Otherwise, the charge had no meaning. If they did not wish to recognize the courts as he did in 1920 and later, then the talk of illegality should cease. He would plead with the League that they should go into the Assembly and state their case and influence the proceedings. But if they did not, he would advise them to test the sincerity of the Assembly and see how it dealt with the Muslim problem. It was due to themselves and the rest of the country unless they wanted to rely upon the law of the sword which he was sure they did not wish to do. Then the League had said that the Assembly represented only the caste Hindus. Surely there were in the Assembly the Scheduled Classes, the Christians, the Parsis, the Anglo-Indians and all those who considered themselves sons of India. Then Dr. Ambedkarlibtech_722_footnotewas good enough to attend the Assembly, not to mention the other large number of the Scheduled Classes. The Sikhs too were still there. It was open to the League to put up their fight within the Assembly.
 As to the British Government who the League contended should dismiss the Assembly, he entertained the hope, though he admitted it was somewhat shaken, that they would honestly carry to the end the voluntary document. He submitted that the British Government was bound to act according to the State Paper even if a few Provinces chose to establish their independence in accordance with the Paper. He hoped that the British would not forfeit all credit for honest dealing with India.
 Gandhiji concluded by saying that whilst he felt obliged to refer to League politics, he warned the audience against inferring that the Hindus and Muslims were to regard each other as enemies. The League had made no such announcement. Let the political quarrel be confined to the politicians at the top. It would be a disaster if the
 
 quarrel permeated in the villages. The way to Indian independence lay not through the sword but through mutual friendship and adjustment. He was in Noakhali to show what real Pakistan could mean. Bengal was the one Province in India where it could be demonstrated. Bengal had produced talented Hindus and talented Muslims. Bengal had contributed largely to the national struggle. It was in the fitness of things that Bengal should now show how the Muslims and the Hindus could live together as friends and brothers. Then there would be no reason for Bengal to remain a deficit province. It ought to be a province of plenty.

       SADHURKHIL, 
  February 	4, 1947 At 	the time of Gandhiji’s speech some Muslim friends wished to read 	an address 	in Bengali which Gandhiji said might be read if it pleased the 	friends. It  referred 	to the 	music before mosques, 	cow-slaughter, etc. 	Gandhiji said 	he was 	not concerned 	with these questions. 	They were questions 	of law. 	He wanted 	to capture 	their hearts and 	see them welded into one. 	If that 	was attained, 	everything else would 	right itself. If their 	hearts were not united, 	nothing could be right. 	Their unfortunate lot 	would then be 	slavery. He 	asked them to 	accept the 	slavery of 	the one Omnipotent God 	no matter by what name they addressed Him. Then they would bend the 	knee to no man or men. It 	was ignorance to 	say that he 	coupled Rama, a 	mere man, with God. He 	had repeatedly made it 	clear that his Rama was the same as God. His Rama was before,  is 	present now and would be for all time. He was Unborn and Uncreated. 	Therefore, let them 	tolerate and respect 	the different 	faiths. He was himself 	an iconoclast 	but he had 	equal regard for 	the so-called idolaters. 	Those who worshipped 	idols also worshipped the 	same God who was everywhere, 	even in 	a clod 	of earth, 	even in 	a nail 	that was pared 	off. He had Muslim friends whose names were Rahim, Rahman, Karim. 	Would he therefore join 	on to the 	name of 	God when 	he addressed 	them as 	Rahim, Karim or 	Rahman?  Let 	them beware of the thought that all was well in Noakhali or the 	neighbouring parts. If the reports he received were at all true, 	things had not quite settled down. He did not refer to these things 	or the destruction that had been wrought because he did not wish to 	excite passion. He did not believe in retaliation. He had lived with 	Pathans. Badshah Khanlibtech_727_footnote, being tired of 	retaliation which had descended from generation to generation, had 	learnt the virtue of non-violence. He did not claim perfection for 	him. He could be angered. But he did claim for his friend the wisdom 	that dictated to him restraint on one’s love of vengeance. He 	wanted the same thing in Noakhali. Unless they sincerely believed 	that without real peace between the communities there was neither 	Pakistan nor Hindustan, slavery was their lot.   
   1925.       
 He had a visit from four Muslim friends who deplored the fact that he had not corrected the exaggeration about the number of murders in Noakhali and the adjacent parts. He had not done so because he did not wish to bring out all he had seen. But if it   at all mended matters he was free to declare that he had found no evidence to support the figure of a thousand. The figure was certainly much smaller. He was also free to admit that the murders in number and brutalities in Bihar eclipsed those in Noakhali. But that admission must not mean a call for him to go to Bihar. He did not know that he could render any greater service by going to Bihar than from here. He would not be worth anything if without conviction he went there at the bidding of anybody. He would need no prompting, immediately he felt that his place was more in Bihar than in Noakhali. He was where he thought he could render the greatest service to both the communities.

 P. O. RAMGANJ, NOAKHALI,
 February 5, 1947
 
MY DEAR ANAND AND BHAKTI,
It was a perfect delight to receive your letter.
 It is interesting to hear about Mr. R.’slibtech_728_footnoteviews. What you said was perfectly true, namely, without purity of heart real non-violence was impossible. If Mr. R. is of opinion that purity of heart is not an essential of non-violent conduct I would like to know the reason why he thinks so.
 That the real non-violent conduct of a person may well be followed in practice by the multitude is perfectly true. Such was my case and is today. But the prime mover has to be au fait with the science of non-violence.
 That Mr. R. may be an atheist would not matter if his conduct corresponds to that of a man of God. Such for instance was Brad- lawlibtech_729_footnotelibtech_730_footnote[sic]. His  atheism  was  only  so-called. He  had faith in the moral
 
 
 government of the world and his conduct was so straight that his funeral was attended by several clergymen. I was an eye-witness because I attended the funeral  myself.libtech_731_footnoteHis  body  was  cremated  at Wokinglibtech_732_footnotelibtech_733_footnote.
 I wonder if this answers your question. If this does not you must tax me again.
 My walking pilgrimage is going on steadily and it certainly gives me immense peace of mind. The upshot I do not know, nor do I care to know. Man has no control over results. That is the sole prerogative of God. Hence I can sing with Cardinal Newman :
 One step enough for me

It is the motto, having given it then, I must endeavour to live it myself.

 SRINAGAR,
 
  February 	5, 1947 Gandhiji began 	his remarks 	by asking the 	volunteers to 	 refrain  from providing decorations and 	a kind of 	ornamental shade where he 	sat. He 	was averse to  all 	these things. It was a waste of labour and money. All that was 	needed was a raised seat with something clean and soft to rest his 	fatless and muscleless bones. He wanted to deal that evening with a 	question that arose out of the meeting of the third instant but he 	could not deal with on the fourth as he had to deal with the 	statement read to him by the Muslim friends. The question was as 	follows :  You 	have asked those provinces 	which have the necessary 	courage to frame 	their own constitutions 	and then ask the British 	army to 	quit their territory 	as proof of 	the attainment 	of independence. 	What, in your 	opinion, should be 	the basis 	of the 	franchise in 	those free Provinces of 	India? Should communal 	electorates be replaced 	by functional 	ones in the Assemblies? 	Should there be  	functional  instead 	 of communal 	representation? Should there be 	joint electorates with 	reservation of seats 	for communal minorities 	or functional 	groups? Should 	there  be  favoured representation 	of any 	group for 	the time being? If 	so, of 	what group? Should we 	have joint electorate, and full adult franchise?  Gandhiji’s 	answer was unequivocal. 	Even one Province 	could frame its own 	constitution and 	enforce it, 	provided that 	it was 	backed not 	by a 	majority of 	one but 	by an overwhelming 	majority. Gandhiji held 	that no power 	on earth 	could resist the lovers 	of liberty 	who were ready 	not to 	kill opponents 	but to 	be killed by 	them. This 	was the view that 	he had enunciated at one 	time.libtech_745_footnoteBut today they 	had made considerable progress. He 	put a 	favourable interpretation 	on the 	Cabinet Mission’s 	State Paper. So 	far as 	he could see 	they could not 	resist the 	declared wish of 	a single province. 	If that 	was true 	of one province, 	say Bengal, 	how much 	more was it so for a 	number of 	provinces which the 	Constituent Assembly 	undoubtedly represented? But 	he was indifferent as to 	what the British 	Government said 	so far as India’s  independence 	was concerned. 	That rested with the 	people and 	with no 	outside power. 	Nor was there any 	question as to what India would do if the State Paper was withdrawn. 	India had 	been accustomed 	to a 	life in 	the wilderness. 	When Pandit Nehru and 	his friends 	accepted office he had 	said that it was 	not a bed 	of roses 	but a 	bed of 	thorns. Their goal was liberty and liberty they would have no matter what happened.  Naturally 	he could speak with confidence when the people had only non- 	violence in view as a steadfast simple policy without reservation. 	If, on the other     
 hand, they thought they could drive away the English by the sword they were vastly mistaken. They did not know the determination and courage of the British. They would not yield to the power of the sword. But they could not withstand the courage of non-violence which disdained to deal death against death. He knew no other power higher than non-violence. And if they were still without real independence, it was, he was sure, because the people had not developed sufficient non-violence. Anyway, the State Paper in his opinion was in answer to the non-violent strength that India had so far developed.
 If they contemplated the last War, they would plainly see that whilst the enemy powers so-called were crushed, the Allied Powers had won but an empty victory. Apart from the wanton destruction of human heads, they had—between the Allies and the enemies—succeeded in draining the world of its food materials and cloth. And the former seemed to be so dehumanized that they entertained the vain hope of reducing the enemies to helotry. It was a question whom to pity more—the Allies or the enemies. Therefore he asked the people bravely to face the consequence whatever it was, feeling secure in the confidence born of non-violence, be it as an honest policy.
 As to the franchise he swore by the franchise of all adults, males and females, above the age of twenty-one or even eighteen. He would bar old men like himself. They were of no use as voters. India and the rest of the world did not belong to those who were on the point of dying. To them belonged death, life to the young. Thus he would have a bar against persons beyond a certain age, say fifty, as he would against youngsters below eighteen. Of course, he would debar lunatics and loafers. Of course, in India free, he could not contemplate communal franchise. It must be joint  electorate, perhaps with reservation of seats. Nor could he contemplate favouritism for anyone, say Muslims, Sikhs or Parsis, for example. If there was to be favouritism he would single out physical lepers. They were an outcome of the crimes of society. If moral lepers would ban themselves, the physical lepers would soon be extinct. And they, poor men, were so frightened of modern society that they put forth no claims. Educate them truly and they would make ideal citizens. Anyway, side by side with adult franchise or even before that he pleaded for universal education, not necessarily literary except perhaps as an aid. English education, he was convinced, had starved their minds, enervated them and never prepared them for brave citizenship. He would give them all sufficient knowledge in the rich languages of which any country would be proud. Education in the understanding of the rights of citizenship was a short term affair if they were honest and earnest.

 INTELLECTUAL AND MANUAL WORK
 Q.  Why should we insist on a Rabindranathlibtech_749_footnoteor a Ramanlibtech_750_footnoteearning his bread  by manual labour? Is it not sheer wastage? Why should not brain workers be considered on a par with manual workers, for both of them perform useful social work?
 A. Intellectual work is important and has an undoubted place in the scheme of life. But what I insist on is the necessity of physical labour. No man, I claim, ought to be free from that obligation. It will serve to improve even the quality of his intellectual output. I venture to say that in ancient times Brahmins worked with their body as with their mind. But even if they did not, body labour is a proved necessity at the present time. In this connection I would refer to the life of Tolstoy and how he made famous the theory of bread-labour first propounded in his country by the Russian peasant Bondaref.

         DHARAMPUR, 
  February 	6, 1947  Gandhiji 	referred to a letter he had received from the Medical Superintendent 	of the Marwari Relief Society. The doctor said that he treated both 	Hindus and Mussa- lmans without any distinction. Muslim men and 	women gladly accepted his services. He noticed that in this part of 	the world the Muslims were poor. There was dirt and insanitation 	wherever he went. Would he (Gandhiji) say something about it?  He 	(Gandhiji) would gladly do so. For he had been a lover of 	cleanliness and sanitation for over fifty years. He had to speak 	much in disparagement of the West. It was therefore a pleasure to 	him to be able to say that he had learnt the laws of cleanliness 	from Englishmen. He was pained to see the same tanks in Noakhali 	used for drinking and cleaning purposes. It was wrong. The people 	thoughtlessly dirtied the streets, lanes and footpaths by spitting 	everywhere and clearing their noses. This was the cause of many 	diseases in India. No doubt, their chronic poverty was responsible 	for the diseases. But their chronic breach of the laws of sanitation 	was no less responsible. It was surprising that India lived at all. 	But it was worst in point of high death rate. America was probably 	the first in the list. And then those that lived were specimens of 	living death. The sooner therefore the inhabitants of Noakhali 	attended to the laws of sanitation the better for them. Poverty was 	no bar to perfect sanitation.  Then 	there was an invasion of Pressmen from far and near. The expression, 	Press Camp, was an attractive expression. But this Press Camp was in 	keeping with the village surroundings and that too with his. His 	surroundings were inconsistent with pomp. The Pressmen who 	accompanied him were living  under  difficult conditions. They had 	to live in such huts as the villagers were able to provide. They       
 had no unlimited accommodation. He would advise them not to venture out but be satisfied with the news that the five or six were able to provide. His barefoot walk need not provide sensation. It ought not to excite people. It was no difficulty for him. The earth of Noakhali was like velvet and the green grass was a magnificent carpet to walk on. It reminded him of the soft English grass he had noticed in England. It was wholly unnecessary to wear sandals to be able to walk on the Noakhali earth and grass. He could not probably have done it in Gujarat, and then he had inherited the traditions of his country. A pilgrimage was always performed barefoot. For him this tour was a pilgrimage pure and simple. But that should be no attraction to Pressmen and others. He considered it as no strain on him. And if God willed it, He would allow him to pull through it.
Let the Pressmen save the time and money; the latter they could
 contribute to the Noakhali Relief Fund or the never-to-end Harijan Fund.
 He then came to the questions put to him.
 Q. Supposing one or the other of the provinces wishes to declare its independence, what kind of constitution would you advise them to prepare? In 1925, you declared that in the Free India of your dreams only those would have voting rights who had contributed by manual labour to the service of the State. Do you adhere to that advice today with regard to the above provinces?
 A. Independence could be the same as for the whole of India. He adhered to what he had said in 1925, viz., that all adults above a certain age, male or female, who would contribute some body labour to the State would be entitled to the vote. Thus a simple labourer would easily be a voter whereas a millionaire or a lawyer or a merchant and the like would find it hard if they did not do some body labour for the State.
 Q. If contiguous provinces in India do not declare such independence but scattered ones do so, would not the presence of the non-federating units create difficulties for the rest in the matter of common action?
 A. He saw no difficulty if the society was of his conception, that is, based on non-violence. Thus supposing populous Bengal with its gifted Tagores and Suhrawardys framed a constitution based on independence and Assam with its opium habit dreamed away life, Orissa with its skeletons had no wish and Bihar was occupied  in family slaughter, they would all three be affected and covered by Bengal. Such infectiousness was inherent in his scheme of independence which was friend to all and enemy to none. It might well be that his was a voice in the wilderness. If so, it was India’s misfortune.
 Q. Do you expect the constitution of the free provinces to be made so attractive that others would voluntarily be drawn into it?
 A.	Attractiveness was inherent in everything that was inherently good.
 Q. Supposing the whole of Group A forms a common constitution, do you think provinces which are now under Group B or C will be able to join A if they so desired?
 A. It went without saying that if the Group A succeeded in framing a good constitution not only would it be open to B and C to join, they would irresistibly be drawn to it.
 Q. What about the States? Who will decide whether a State should join the Union or not: the present rulers or the people? If it is to be the latter then what changes would you expect to be first made in the constitutions of the present States?
 A. He was a mere humble ryot but he belonged to the many crores. The Rajas were nominally 640, in reality they were probably less than 100. Whatever the number was, they were so few that in an awakened India, they could only exist as servants of the ryots not in name but in actual practice. He did not share the fear underlying the question that the British would be so dishonest as to play the Rajas against the ryots. That was not the note of the Cabinet Mission Paper. But why should India depend upon the British Cabinet? When India was ready, neither the British nor the Rajas, nor any combination of the Powers could keep India from her destined goal, her birthright, as the Lokamanyalibtech_757_footnotewould have said.

  	I never succeeded in writing to you on your first personal letter. 	The second on B’s relation with A now comes. I must undertake this 	second today. I sent your letter to A. You left it open for me to do 	so. My loyalty to him demanded that I should.  	B has led you into doing an injustice to A. I discussed it with her. 	She saw the truth of it. A’s love is wholly free from animal 	passion. I have called it poetic. It is not a perfect adjective but 	I can find no better. He loved once a girl with the same passion 	with which he loves B. In either case, it was philanthropic. The 	first came in a flash, the second took practically two years to 	discover. He thought he would give B the best of him in point of 	education. In his opinion both cases went wrong because of my 	initial aversion. In the first, I relented when, as A thinks, it was 	too late. In the second, it is almost    
 too late. The first girl is married. He is entitled to hope till B is married elsewhere, if she is. So far as B knows herself, it is a sealed book. Now mark the beauty of it. A says so long as B does not change her mind, she will be as sister or daughter to him and [that he] would never make any other advances to her. B believes this assurance, what she objects to is his shadowing her as she calls it.
 If he does not get B as wife, he will never think of making love to another woman. He is too pure to think of any such thing. If you accept my analysis, you will render justice to A and lead B aright.
 I do wish you could see that in non-violent conduct, whether individual or universal, there is an indissoluble connection between private, personal life and public. You may be as generous and charitable as you like in judging men, but you cannot  overlook private deflections from the right conduct. If you are convinced about this proposition, you should pursue my connection with Manu and if you find a flaw, try to show it to me.
 I have written in order to save your time and to let you think.
 But I shall welcome discussion, if you like it.

         PRASADPUR, 
  February 	7, 1947 QUESTION: 	You have always been 	against charity and have preached the doctrine that no man is 	free from the obligation of bread-labour. What is your advice  for 	people who are engaged in sedentary occupations but lost their all 	in the last riots? Should they migrate and try to find a place where 	they can go back to their old accustomed habits of life or should 	they try to remodel their life in conformity with your ideal of 	bread-labour for everybody? What use shall their special talents be 	in that case?  In 	reply, Gandhiji said that it was true that for years he had been 	against charity as it was understood and that he had for years 	preached the duty of bread- labour. In this connection he mentioned 	the visit he had had from the District Magistrate and Zaman Saheb 	along with a police officer. They wanted his opinion about giving 	doles to the refugees. They had already decided to put before them 	the work of removal of the water hyacinth, repair of roads, village 	reconstruction or straightening out their own plots of land or 	building on their lands. Those who did any one of these things had a 	perfect right to rations. He said that he liked the idea. But as a 	practical idealist he would not take the refugees by storm. A 	variety of work should be put before the people and they should have 	one month’s notice that if they made no choice of the occupations 	suggested, nor did they suggest some other acceptable occupation but 	declined to do any work though their bodies were fit, they would be 	reluctantly obliged to tell the refugees that they would not be able 	to give them doles after the expiry of the notice. He advised the 	refugees and their friends to render full co-operation to the 	Government in such a scheme of work. It was wrong for any citizen to 	expect rations without doing some physical work.  He 	could never advise people to leave their homes. He would like even 	one solitary Hindu to feel safe under any circumstances and would 	expect the Muslims to make him perfectly safe in their midst. He 	should welcome them to worship God in    
 the way they knew.
 He certainly did not consider money got through speculation as rightly  gained. Nor did he consider it impossible for man to shed bad or evil habits at any time. If everybody lived by the sweat of his brow, the earth would become a paradise. The question of the use of special talents hardly needed separate consideration. If everyone laboured physically for his bread, it followed that poets, doctors, lawyers, etc., would regard it their duty to use those talents gratis for the service of humanity. Their output will be all the better and richer for their selfless devotion to duty.

 This is the letter I promised you when you were good enough to see me yesterday.
I am quite clear that you should not abruptly stop rations until
 
 
 due notice (at least one month) of their stoppage is given to the refugees that they will be stopped unless one of the specified items of work is done by them against the rations which should be adequate and medically fit for consumption. The items should include :
  Road 	construction or 	road repair for 	at least 	two hours 	per day, 	Sundays excluded.  Removal 	of water 	hyacinth for the same 	period as 	in (1), under supervision.  House 	building on their 	own vacated 	lands for 	the same period as in (1), with material and tools supplied by the Government. Village 	reconstruction for the 	same period as 	in (1). Cleaning 	of tanks 	for the same 	period as in (1).  Hand-spinning 	for four 	hours per day, 	cotton and wheel 	or takli 	being supplied 	by the 	Government; spinning to 	include ginning, 	carding or 	tunai or punai.  Weaving 	for the same 	period as in (6), 	tools and accessories 	and yarn, double-twisted 	in the 	case of hand-spun, 	being supplied 	by the Government.  Dhenki-husking, 	same period 	as in (1), dhenkis 	being supplied by 	the Government.  Oil-pressing 	out of coconut 	or seeds 	supplied by 	the Government.  Any 	other village craft 	chosen by 	the Government 	or refugees, 	approved by the 	Government for 	the period as 	in (1) or 	(6) as 	the case may be. 
 Efficient working of the foregoing is wholly dependent upon a well-thought-out scheme capably managed by the Government. This is no famine measure. It is conceived wholly in the spirit of  the  maxim, no labour no food.
 No breakdown in transport or other Government machinery should stop the supply of rations to the helpless unfortunate sufferers. I would suggest that refugees who are not willing or are
 otherwise incapable may be supplied rations against payment at fixed
 rates.
 The time for ploughing for the next crop is soon ebbing away. Therefore agricultural implements, bullocks and seeds have to be supplied at once or disaster may have to be faced.
This was written at 2 a. m. and has not been seen by Shri Satis
 Chandra Das Gupta of Khadi Pratishthan. I would suggest your seeing and consulting him since I am wholly ignorant of local conditions.

         NANDIGRAM, 
  February 	8, 1947  Q. 	The Mussalmans are 	boycotting the Hindus. Those Hindus who possess more land than they 	can till themselves are in a serious difficulty. What is your advice 	to them? What will they do about the surplus land which they hold 	but cannot till themselves, even if they take up the plough 	themselves?  A. 	In answer 	Gandhiji said 	that he had 	heard of 	the boycott 	and had made 	some remarks at 	previous meetings. He 	hoped, indeed he 	knew, that the 	boycott was 	not universal 	in Noakhali. 	It was 	probably confined to 	a few. Whatever the 	extent, he 	had no doubt 	that it was 	wrong and would do no 	good to 	the boycotters 	as it could 	not to 	those against whom 	it was 	directed. That 	opinion was 	held by him 	for a large 	number of 	years, say 	sixty. But 	there was 	a condition 	in which 	he would 	conceive it possible, 	i. e., 	if the 	Muslims regarded the 	Hindus as 	their enemies 	and wished 	to avoid 	their presence in 	Noakhali. That 	would amount to a 	declaration of 	war from 	which every Indian would 	recoil with horror. In 	isolated cases, 	his opinion 	was emphatic. 	The Hindu 	under the boycott 	would allow his 	land to 	lie fallow 	like the Australians 	or he would 	sell the surplus 	land. What was best 	was that 	nobody should possess 	more than he 	could himself use. 	That was the ideal  the  	society  should strive 	to reach.  Q. 	You have been working 	here for the last three months. Has there been any appreciable 	change in the mentality of the Hindus?  A. 	The question could best 	be answered by the Hindus concerned. He flattered himself with the 	belief that the Hindus had, at least for the time being, shed their 	cowardice to an extent.  Q. 	There is certainly a 	peace-loving section among the Mussalmans. After your presence in 	their midst, have they been influenced to such an extent that they 	are able to assert themselves against the worse element in their own 	community?  A.	As to this third question he was glad that the questioner admitted that    
 there was a peace-loving section among the Muslims of Noakhali. It would be monstrous if there was not. Whether they had developed courage to oppose the bad and mischievous element in Muslim society, he would give the same answer that he gave to the second question. The Muslim friends could reply with certainty. But he was vain enough to believe that several Muslim friends had been so affected. As for instance, the Muslim witnesses in Bhatialpur declared that the destroyed mandirlibtech_770_footnotehe had openedlibtech_771_footnotethey would defend against destruction in future with their lives. There were other consoling instances he had met with during his tour.
 Q. Several workers are engaged in village work according to your direction. what had been the result of their work on the local Hindu or Muslim population? If you had not been here, would their influence have been equal to what it is at present? Will the present influence of your workers be of a lasting character?
 A.  As to this fourth question Gandhiji said that if he was pure and meant what   he said, his work was bound to survive his death. He believed that there must be perfect correspondence between private and public conduct. Similarly, if  his associates were actuated purely by the spirit of service and were pure within and without and were not dominated by the glamour that surrounded him, they would work on with unabated zeal and their joint work would flourish with time. He had never subscribed to the superstition that any good work died with the worker’s death. On the contrary, all true and solid work made the worker immortal by the survival of his work after his death.

         BIJOYNAGAR, 
  February 	9, 1947  Q. 	It has been our 	experience that a worker becomes power-loving after some time. 	How are the rest of 	his co-workers 	to keep 	him in check? 	In other 	words, how are 	we to preserve 	the democratic 	character of the 	organization? We 	have found that 	non-co-operation with the 	party in 	question does not help. 	The work of the 	organization itself suffers. A. 	   This is not your experience  alone;  it   is  almost   	universal. Love 	of power is usual in man and often it only dies with his death.    
 Therefore, it is difficult for co-workers to keep him in check, if only because they are more likely than not to have the same human frailty; and so long as we do not know a single completely non-violent organization in the world, we cannot claim to know the utterly democratic character of an organization because, as can be definitely proved, no perfect democracy is possible without perfect non-violence at the back of it. The question would be proper if non-co-operation was violent as it often, if not invariably, is.  Claiming  to  know somewhat from experience the non-violent character of non-co- operation, I suggest that given a good cause, non-violent non-co- operation must succeed and no organization can suffer through offering non-violent non-co-operation. The questioner labours under the difficulty of having experience of non-co-operation, at best partially non-violent, at its worst bare-faced violence sailing under the name of non-violence. The pages of the Harijan and Young India are filled with instances of abortive non-co-operation, because of these two vital defects, non-violence being partial or totally absent. During my long experience, I also noticed that those who complain of others being ambitious of holding power are no less ambitious themselves, and when it is a question of distinguishing between half a dozen and six, it becomes a thankless task.
 Q. In almost all villages there are parties and factions. When we draft local help, whether we wish it or not, we become involved in local power politics. How can we steer clear of this difficulty? Should we try to bypass both parties and carry on work with the help of outside workers? Our experience has been that such work becomes entirely contingent upon outside aid and crumbles down as soon as the latter is withdrawn. What should we do then to develop local initiative and foster local co- operation?
A.    Alas for India that parties and factions are to be found in the
 villages as they are to be found in our cities. And when power politics enters our villages with less thought of the welfare  of  the  villages and more of using them for increasing the parties’ own power, this becomes a hindrance to the progress of the villagers rather than a help. I would say that whatever be the consequence, we must make use as much as possible of local help and if we are free from the taint of power politics, we are not likely to go wrong. Let us remember that the English educated men and women from the cities have criminally neglected the villages of India which are the backbone of the country. The process of remembering our neglect will induce patience. I have never gone to a single village which is devoid of an honest worker. We
 fail to find him when we are not humble enough to recognize any merit in our villagers. Of course, we  are  to  steer  clear  of  local politics and this we shall learn to do when we accept help from all parties and no parties, wherever it is really good. I would regard it as fatal for success to bypass villagers. As I knew this very difficulty, I have tried rigidly to observe the rule of one village one worker, except that where he or she does not know Bengali, an interpreter’s help has been given. I can only say that this system has so far answered the purpose. I must, therefore, discount your experiences. I would further suggest that we have got into the vicious habit of coming to hasty conclusions. Before pronouncing such a sweeping condemnation as is implied in the sentence that ‘work becomes entirely contingent upon outside aid and crumbles down as soon as the latter is withdrawn’, I would go so far as to say that even a few years’ experience of residence in a single village, trying to work through local workers, should not be regarded as conclusive proof that work could not be done through and by local workers. The contrary is obviously true. It now becomes unnecessary for me to examine the last sentence in detail. I can categorically say to the principal worker: ‘If you have any outside help, get rid of it. Work singly, courageously, intelligently with all local help you can get and, if you do not succeed, blame only yourself and no one else and nothing else.’
 Q. If we are to start khadi work in the devastated areas in Noakhali, should we begin with financial and technical aid from outside or slowly build up the whole structure with local men and money alone?
A. I will say in your own words: ‘Slowly build up the whole
 structure with local men and money’ taking care to make yourself sure that you know the whole art of spinning in the widest sense I have given to the term. What that sense is you should learn from my writings in the Harijan which you will do if you have the requisite eagerness.
 Q. The cultivators and land-owners who used to have their land tilled by Muslim labour have lost two crops namely mircha (long pepper), til seeds and mustard seeds owing to the loot of agricultural implements and bullocks and want of labour from Muslims. The time for ploughing fields for the next boro and aus crop is impending and unless the cultivators get these within fifteen days, they will almost lose that crop also.
A.    This is most unfortunate if it is true. I have no doubt that all
 such land should be put under cultivation not only for the sake of the
 owners but also for the State, which is or should be more concerned with the cultivation of food crops even than the owners. Therefore the owners should ask the authorities for this assistance and the State should see to it that all such land is beneficially cultivated. It is the duty of the State to ask and encourage Muslim labour to render this essential service whether the owner be a Muslim or a Hindu. The State should certainly see that all labour is adequately paid by fixing the wages.

  	I do not at all feel happy in having to take your time, but you are 	being drawn into this.  	The friends in our circle have been very much upset because of 	Manu’s sleeping with me. Kishorelal’s agony is difficult to 	bear. He is so upset that he is on the verge of breaking down. The 	same is the case with Narahari and Swamilibtech_777_footnote.  I  do  not  know  how   the  women  at Sevagram and 	elsewhere must be suffering. Here, on the contrary, everybody knows 	what is happening but I see no sign of its having any effect. Maybe 	that prevents me from feeling the full impact of people’s 	reactions. I keep playing with such fancies, for the co- workers’ 	pain makes me lose confidence in myself. My own mind, however, is 	becoming firmer than ever, for it has been my belief for a long time 	that that alone is true brahmacharya which requires no 	hedges. My experiments arose from this belief. I did make mistakes 	inthem. Unthinking imitation may also have harmed the persons 	concerned. But I am not conscious of myself having fallen.  	Manu’s sleeping with me is not a part of my experiment, but is a 	part of the present yajna. My mind daily sleeps in  an  	innocent  manner with millions of women, and Manu also, who is a 	blood  relation to me, sleeps with me as one of these millions.  	If she stops doing that out of deference to custom or to please 	co-workers, would I not be a hypocrite of the type described in  	chapter III [of the Gita]? If I do not appear to people 	exactly as I am within, wouldn’t that be a blot on my 	non-violence? I go to this length: Suppose that non-violence has no 	effect on the people here and I die. If I don’t let Manu sleep 	with me, though I regard it as essential that she should, wouldn’t 	that be a sign of weakness in me, and in that case would not my 	death, since I would have failed to realize perfect ahimsa, be the 	best thing for me? In other words, would not my experiment in ahimsa 	and truth remain incomplete or be tainted? Perhaps I have not 	expressed this last thought clearly. I referred  to  the  subject  	in  three  speecheslibtech_778_footnotelibtech_779_footnoteof  mine.   Fuller   reports

MEETINGlibtech_781_footnote","
         BIJOYNAGAR, 
  February 	10, 1947  At 	the outset Gandhiji 	referred to the fact 	that he was to go to 	Gopinathpur and 	was assured 	that it was 	no more 	than one and a 	half miles. He 	began his 	trek but 	Gopinathpur seemed to 	be receding from view. 	When they had walked 	for forty-five 	minutes he 	said he 	should go 	no further if 	he was not to 	collapse. He 	therefore, retraced his steps. It took full one hour and twenty minutes which was too much for     
 him. In future, those who invited him to walk to a place should measure the time taken  by a leisurely walk. He tendered his apology to the Hindus and Muslims of Gopinathpur and they owed an apology to Noakhali for not having been accurate and precise in their speech. He incidentally mentioned that the people were found to have blown their noses on the path. This was dangerous and dirty, especially for a people who had the habit of walking barefoot.
 A friend had told him that he found a Muslim trader who had proper scales and a Hindu who had improper scales and asked him whether it wasnot true that the Muslim traders were honest and the Hindu traders dishonest. He was sure that the inference was wrong. In this imperfect world no community was wholly honest or dishonest. All he could say was that a man who sported false scales for deceiving his customers was a criminal. But he could not take it upon himself to condemn the whole group or community.
 Q. You have said that you will stay here as long as perfect peace and amity between the two communities was not established and that you will die here if necessary. Do you not think that such a long stay here will unnecessarily focus Indian and world attention on Noakhali, leading people to think that excesses  still continued to be committed here, whereas on the contrary no unseemly acts have been committed by Mussalmans for sometime now?
 A. No impartial observer could draw the mischievous inference from his presence. He was there as their friend and servant. His presence had certainly advertised Noakhali as a beautiful place which would be a paradise on earth if the Hindus and the Muslims lived in hearty friendship. It may be that at the end of the chapter he might be noted down as a failure who knew very little about ahimsa. Moreover, it was impossible for him to stay in Noakhali if the Hindus and the Muslims satisfied him that they had established hearty friendship between  themselves. He was sorry to tell them that he had evidence to show that things were not quite as they should be.
 Q.   Don’t you think that the Hindus are artificially keeping up the appearance  of tension by staying away from their homes in spite of promises of good behaviour by the Mussalmans which they have also made good in cases where they have been given an opportunity?
 A. He did not think that many Hindus were wilfully staying away from their homes. No one would want to be away from his home without attractive inducements. He had heard nothing of such inducements. But he knew that fright and the absence of the wherewithal were keeping them back. Nevertheless, he was assured by the officials that the number returning was satisfactory. They could not cope with a greater number. When these obvious causes were present there was no occasion to draw far-fetched inferences which could not be proved. If, however, there were any
 instigators keeping them back, the law was there to punish them. The proof of the pudding was in the eating. If it was true that the general body of the Muslims really wanted the refugees back, he was quite sure they would gladly return. But the picture was not so rosy as was painted by the questioner.
 Q. Don’t you think that the dictates of non-violence and friendship to all demand withdrawal or dropping of cases against the Mussalmans?
 A. He did not know that there was much non-violence in the air. Even non- violent conduct could not arrest the course of law. And non-violent conduct on the part of the frightened injured party could not operate until the culprits declared themselves and were penitent. The fact was that not only was there no penitence on their part, but they were absconding. He was averse to mass arrests. And he was for severe punishment of those who were proved to have manufactured complaints.
 Q. Is not the double-faced policy of the Cabinet Mission at the root of the present trouble between the League and the Congress and ultimately between the Muslims and the Hindus?
 A. He would not accuse the Cabinet Mission of double-dealing. They had honestly suggested a solution which in their opinion was fair. The beauty of the Paper was that it contained no compulsion. Naturally, after acceptance the clauses became obligatory for the accepting party. But any party could refuse acceptance. Thus if Assam in the east and Baluchistan in the west rejected the Grouping, no power  on earth could compel them under the Cabinet Mission Paper. Lastly, assuming that the Cabinet Mission Paper was a trap, why should the Congress and the League fall into it?
 Q. Pakistan means complete independence for the Muslims in the Muslim majority Provinces and for the Hindus in Hindu majority Provinces. Why then does the Congress object to it?
 A. The answer was simple. If Pakistan meant independence only to the Muslims in the Muslim majority provinces and vice versa, it was summarily rejected. Happily not one Muslim leader, certainly not the Qaid-e-Azam, had ever given that meaning. Were the Hindus in Bihar to be independent and the Muslims helots? Or were the Hindus to be helots in Bengal? He hoped not.
 Q.  Can there be any hope of establishing Hindu-Muslim unity here in spite   of the Congress-League differences which are at the root of all the troubles everywhere? Even if it is established, how long can it be expected to last?
 A. He admitted that Hindu-Muslim unity could not be sustained in the face of Congress-League differences. He hoped, however, that apart from party politics, whilst there was time, the Hindus and the Muslims in Noakhali would act together as real friends. They should set an example to all India and especially to the League and the Congress. Anyway, that was the mission that brought him to Noakhali. He
 wanted to pass his examination in pure ahimsa. If it was pure, it must result in establishing that friendship which he desired at heart. Therefore, if it was not established, the failure would be his. And as ahimsa knew no failure, he had said he would do or die in Noakhali. Let the questioner and those who thought like him help the fruition of the effort.

549,"February 	11, 1947",SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING,"
         HAMCHANDI, 
  February 	11, 1947 QUESTION: A 	Billlibtech_782_footnotehas 	been introduced in the Bengal Assembly which contemplates reduction 	of the landlord’s share from one-half to one-third of the crop  in 	certain cases. According to the new proposal, a farmer who has been 	in service on his master’s land on or after December 22, 1946 	cannot be ousted from the land for a term of three years. Muslim 	farmers on the char 	lands have suddenly 	developed extraordinary enthusiasm for securing land on the barga 	system from Hindu 	land- owners. Many of the so-called owners in char 	lands are in fact 	farmers themselves, only they left the land in charge of the 	bargadars (tenants) 	when they fled during the riots in October last. Muslim farmers 	cannot just now be ousted from the land as the crop will not mature 	till about the month of June. Hindus will, therefore, lose 	possession of the land for the next three years at least if the Bill 	becomes law. Now that Hindu farmers are once more coming back to 	their lands, what should they do in order not to lose their 	agricultural occupation through the vagaries of the law?  ANSWER: It is improper to 	die before one’s death. Let them wait till the Bill becomes law. 	Yet, I would advise them to welcome reduction of the landlord’s 	share from one-half to one-third. The time is coming when all lands 	will belong to the State, that is, to the labourer on the land. This 	is not to be looked upon as a communal question. It may be that the 	landlords are Hindus in Noakhali. But if the legislation is sound, 	it should not matter whom it affects. I have serious doubts as to 	the propriety of not ousting labourers  for  a period of three 	years. I would want to see the proposed legislation. As to the 	alleged usurpation of land by the Muslims, in my opinion, that is 	indefensible, if true. Let there be authentic instances and I have 	no doubt that the grievances would be remedied. No Government of the 	people can, for a moment, tolerate usurpation. If there are Muslims 	who had tilled the land that was unoccupied by reason of the    
 disturbances, all that the tiller could claim is wages for the work done on the land. In reality, if he tilled the land for his neighbour who was in adversity, it would be a neighbourly act for which there could be no remuneration. Any such proved usurpation has to be reported to get remedied.
 Q. You have advised both men and women to turn into voluntary labourers to  hold no more land than they can till themselves. But under our present social system in which the State does not take responsibility for the education of the young and the maintenance of the aged and the infirm when there is none else to look after them, these expenses are paid out of rent received from the land or from profits derived from private ownership. What will happen to the above persons when land and capital are taken away from them? Could not suffering be avoided and adequate provision made for the education of the young and the maintenance of the aged or infirm?
A. I admit I gave the advice and I still adhere to it. I laid down
 a universal proposition for an ideal society. In the present case it is a virtue of necessity for it is said that they cannot get labour which is principally Muslim. The question about the education of the young and maintenance of the old and the infirm should not arise. The young would get education at home and persons who work willingly will find that the old and infirm would be supported.
 I am, however, free to confess that it is the business of the State to provide suitable education for the young and support for the aged and infirm. It should also be remembered that I have not suggested that owners should give up their land free of price. They would sell it on suitable terms or hold on to it and let it lie fallow. It will not hurt.

 KAFILATALI,
  February 	12, 1947  Gandhiji 	said that when he was 	studying in 	London over 45 	years ago, he 	had read 	of the 	bravery of 	the Manipuris. 	The members 	of the 	delegationlibtech_786_footnote, Gandhiji 	said, had 	complained to 	him that although caste 	Hindus in Assam 	considered the Manipuris 	part of themselves, 	yet they 	did not look 	after the interests 	of the 	Manipuris who 	had  a 	separate language, a 	separate culture and 	a separate tradition of 	their own. The 	caste Hindus, 	the delegation had 	complained, took 	advantage of the presence 	of the Manipuris 	in their 	midst only to swell 	their votes. But none 	either understood or 	cared for 	the Manipuris’ 	interests. Therefore, they 	thought, some 	arrangement should 	be made 	for safeguarding 	their interests.  Gandhiji 	said that all that 	he wanted 	to say on this 	was that 	if Hinduism 	was to 	survive, it 	would have 	to be casteless. 	He had 	long since forgotten that 	he belonged 	 to any 	caste. Therefore, he 	delighted in 	calling himself a 	Bhangi and 	acting like one. 	He did 	not believe in 	any artificial divisions.  If 	caste Hindus meant 	Brahmin, Kshatriya and 	Vaishya, these 	three were a hopeless 	minority which, when the 	British had 	wholly withdrawn and 	independence was 	truly established would, 	as the 	three superior castes, be 	wholly extinct. Gandhiji 	hoped that 	all inequalities 	would be a thing 	of the past. 	Then  the  so-called 	downtrodden would come 	into their own.  Gandhiji 	said that, when untouchability was really gone, there would be no 	caste. But while the caste system was in vogue, the untouchables 	would naturally want to belong to the higher castes. But that was an 	impossibility. Therefore any such attempt, according to Mahatma 	Gandhi, meant war among caste members on the one hand and the 	untouchables on the other. But when castes disappeared, all would be 	Hindus pure and simple. What he would say to the untouchables was 	that they should abolish all distinctions among themselves and 	observe the laws of cleanliness better than the so-called caste 	Hindus. And instead of working for separate treatment for themselves 	they should endeavour to merge themselves in the ocean of Hindu 	humanity.  Gandhiji, 	replying to a question, said he was emphatically of the opinion that 	the Hindus of Noakhali should not live in a special centre in 	Noakhali and erect factories where they could work. Apart from his 	views on cottage industries, he could    
 not contemplate separate quarters and separate industries for them. That was the way to establish poisonous Pakistan all over India.
 He could not approve of the idea anywhere in India. That was the way to create wars among themselves. It was not the way to independence. He could not approve of separate “quarters”, for communities professing different religions.
Independent India, as conceived by me, will have all Indians
 belonging to different religions living in perfect friendship. There need be no millionaires and no paupers; all would belong to the State, for the State belonged to them. I will die in the act of realizing this dream. I would not wish to live to see India torn asunder by civil strife.

         EAST 	KEROA, 
  February 	13, 1947  After 	congratulating the 	audience on 	the manner 	in which 	they had kept time 	during the Ramdhun, 	Gandhiji dealt with the 	two questions which had 	been put 	to him in 	course of the day.  Q. 	We agree 	that intrinsically 	a movement 	for reducing 	the share 	of the 	owner from half to a 	third of 	the crop is 	justified.libtech_797_footnoteBut could 	not the present 	Tebhaga movement 	in Bengal 	be postponed 	until such time as 	when the affected 	persons can be 	smoothly absorbed 	in other occupations 	according to some 	long-term plan 	sponsored by 	the State? 	We know 	you have 	said that the only 	way to 	effect such a 	radical transformation in 	society is 	through non-violence. But 	interested parties will 	sleep over that portion 	of your 	advice and parade 	your moral support to 	their demand 	and carry 	on the movement 	in their 	own violent 	way. Hence is it not 	wrong for 	you to lend 	support to 	the Movement 	under the present 	circumstances when there 	is every 	chance of 	the entire 	middle class of Bengal 	being completely ruined as 	a result? The 	common villager will 	also suffer no 	less because 	he will 	also be deprived 	of the 	services now 	being rendered to 	the village economy by them.  A. 	 In reply, 	Gandhiji uttered the 	warning that 	he only 	dealt with principles   as 	he knew them. He 	had not studied the 	local question. 	Therefore, the questioner 	ran the 	risk of 	his ignorance 	causing injustice.  He 	felt that the question betrayed exaggeration on the part of the 	questioner.        
 There was no ruin impending for the landlord. His land was not being confiscated. His portion, which he could take even if he was in Timbuktu, was merely to be reduced from 50% to 33%. He could see no ruin in the proposal. He was afraid they were too much obsessed by the communal question. They should rise above it and examine every problem strictly on merits. Then they would never go wrong. Therefore they should accept the moral principle underlying the demand for reduction of the owner’s share and work for solid amendments in which they were likely to succeed. Let them not face confiscation rather than moderate reduction. Let them remember that for years past India had lived through confiscation. Industry after industry had been ruined and both the artisans as well as the farmers of India had been progressively reduced to poverty.
 If the desired changes were brought about through non-violent means, the world would not be deprived of the talents of the classes, but then the latter would not exercise them at the expense of the labourers. In the non-violent order of the future, the land would belong to the State, for had it not been said ‘sabhi bhumi Gopalki’libtech_798_footnote? Under such dispensation, there would be no waste of talents and labour. This would be impossible through violent means. It was therefore a truism to say that the utter ruin of the land-owners brought about through violence would also involve the ruin of the labourers in the end. If the land-owners, therefore, acted wisely, no party would lose.
 Q. Some women workers who earn part of their living by weaving mats were advised by you the other day to work on co-operative principles. Bengal’s agriculture has been reduced to an uneconomic proposition through extreme fragmentation of holdings. Would you advise farmers also to adopt co-operative methods? If so, how are they to effect this under the present system of land-ownership? Should the State make the necessary changes in the law? If the State is not ready, but the people so desire, how are they to work through their own organizations to this end?
 A. Replying to the first part of the question, Gandhiji said that he had no doubt that the system of co-operation was far more necessary for the agriculturists than for the mat weavers. The land, as he maintained, belonged to the State; therefore, it yielded the largest return when it was worked co-operatively. Let it be remembered that co-operation should be based on strict non-violence. There was no such thing as success of violent co-operation. Hitler was a forcible example of the latter. He also talked vainly of co-operation which was forced upon the people and everyone knew where Germany had been led as a result.
 Gandhiji concluded by saying that it would be a sad thing if India also tried to build up the new society based on co-operation by means of violence. Good brought about through force destroyed individuality. Only when the change was effected
 
 through the persuasive power of non-violent non-co-operation, i. e., love, could the foundation of individuality be preserved and real abiding progress be assured for the world.

         WEST 	KEROA, 
  February 14, 1947 Gandhiji read two passages from Abdullah Suhrawardy’s collections of the sayings of the Prophet. Three Muslim friends of the place had come to him and asked  him 	to pray that God might make both [Hindus and Muslims] live in peace 	and friendship. When these friends came he was reading the sayings 	which he proposed to read to them. They were as follows :  Be 	in the world like a traveller, or like a passer-on, and reckon 	yourself as of the dead.  He 	considered it as a gem of gems. They knew that death might overtake 	them any moment. What a fine preparation for the event if all became 	as dead. The very next question was who was the best man and who was 	the worst. The Prophet considered him to be the best who lived long 	and performed good acts and him the worst who did bad acts. It was a 	striking saying that man was to be judged by what he did, and not by 	what he said.  These 	sayings were for all men and women and not merely for those who 	called themselves Muslims. Was the Hindu part of the audience doing 	good acts? Was untouchability a good act? He had shouted from the 	house-tops that it was a blot on Hinduism. So long as that blot 	remained, there was no peace and freedom for India. The British 	would go but their freedom would not come without the complete 	removal of untouchability.

  CHI. 	PYARELAL,  	I received your letter just now. The lesson for Manu is attractive 	from the point of view of handwriting. It needs more meticulousness. 	As you become more meticulous, your handwriting will become as 	beautiful as pearls. Then I shall not only read it myself, I shall 	also make Manu read it. This time there are four pages. My 	suggestion is that just two pages will be sufficient. Manu will not 	be able to take in     
 more at present because she has a heavy load of work and she does not wish to give up any of it. So she has no time left. I have not even asked her what she herself has in mind. I am not asking her even while dictating this. I am stealing even this little time. I am quite fatigued mentally and physically. The body wants to relax. Not so the mind. The mind is absorbed in Bengali. But the memory having become blunted, the progress is slow. Swamiji is not here. As such, I am the only one left to teach Sanskrit. And I cannot spare time. One cannot say that even Swamiji was giving much time. Manu’s development does not depend on learning all that. It largely depends on me. And so, it will depend on my efficiency and patience. I have not even in my dream considered keeping Kishorelal’s letter, or any letter, secret from you. But I do wish to spare you mental anguish. But if you cannot check your curiosity it would be only proper that you should see it. So I am sending you the letter. Return it after reading. From my point of view, it contains as much ignorance as love. From his point of view, there is a whole group of people who believe that my practice is impelled by lust. How can I say that the view of this group is altogether wrong ? For, man does not know himself. You will not find any open accusation made in these letters, though in Devdas’s letter it is openly made. Whether or not I am free from physical desire will probably be known only after my death. The term ‘probably’ is deliberately used, because it does not always happen that we are able to correctly judge a man after his death. Only God understands the heart of man. When I cannot say with any certainty about myself that  I do not feel the weight of whatever is happening, who can say that about Manu ? She appears to be unconcerned, but she herself may not be fully aware of the turmoil in her mind. I am not bothering her about it. I am carrying on, leaving everything in the hands of God. For me, all this is an inseparable part of the yajna and it remains to be seen how far my non–attachment can carry.
 I have read both your papers. I am sending them back, though you have said that it is not necessary to return the second paper. Your reply to Satis Babu is correct. The reply about Dr. Chandra Shekhar is also correct. He must certainly be given medicines, etc. If possible, persuade him to reduce the use of medicines. More than medicines, what is needed is nursing and reassurance.

 RAIPURA,
    CHI. 	GHANSHYAMDAS,  February 	15, 1947 
  	I sent you a letter through Sushila. But I have been upset somewhat 	by Sardar’s letter. Devdas’s letter is still ringing in my ears. 	 I do not remember what I wrote to you, for I have not kept a copy 	of it. All I wish today to write is that you should give up your 	attitude of neutrality. Sardar is quite clear in his mind that what 	I look upon as my dharma is really adharma. Devdas of course 	has written as much. I have great faith in Sardar’s judgment. I 	have faith in Devdas’s judgment too, but then, though grown up, in 	my eyes he is still a child. This cannot be said of Sardar. 	Kishorelal and Narahari too are grown-ups; but it is not difficult 	for me to  understand  their opposition. The link between you and me 	is your faith that my life is pure, spotless and wholly dedicated to 	the performance of dharma. If that is not so, very little else 	remains. I would, therefore, like you to take full part in this 	discussion, though not necessarily publicly—for I certainly do not 	want your business to suffer. But if I am conducting myself 	sinfully, it becomes the duty of all friends to oppose me 	vehemently. A satyagrahi may end up as a duragrahi if he 	comes to regard untruth as truth—that being the only distinction 	between the two. I believe that is not the case with me; but that 	means little, for after all I am not God. I can commit mistakes; I 	have committed mistakes; this may prove to be my biggest at the fag 	end of my life. If that be so, all my well-wishers can open my eyes 	if they oppose me. If they do not I shall go from here even as I am. 	Whatever I am doing here is as a part of my yajna. There is 	nothing I do knowingly which is not a part and parcel of that yajna. 	Even the rest I take is as a part of that yajna.  	I am dictating this with a mud-pack over my eyes and abdomen. 	Shortly afterwards I shall be going to the evening prayer meeting. 	This business about Manu is taking up a lot of my time, but I do not 	mind it because even her presence here is for the sake of that 	yajna. Her test constitutes a part of that yajna. I 	may not be able to explain it to you—that is a different matter. 	The point I must make my friends grasp is this: When I take Manu in 	my lap, do I do so as a pure- hearted father or as a father who has 	strayed from the path of virtue? 
 What I am doing is nothing new to me; in thought I have done it over the last 50 years; in action, in varying degrees, over quite a number of years. Even if you sever all connection with me, I would not feel hurt. Just as I want to stick to my dharma, you have to stick to yours.
 To come to another matter, the Hindu weavers here—known as tantis—are very angry. Their spinning-wheels and houses have been for the most part burnt. If they do not get a supply of yarn they have either to be idle or take to earth work as labourers. The officer in charge here tells me that the Government cannot provide them yarn unless the Central Government helps. I told him I might be able to obtain the needed supply if they were prepared to pay for it. He has agreed. Can you supply the yarn? If yes, then how much, when and at what price? Will it be necessary to obtain the sanction of the Interim Government? Please let me know in detail.

 RAIPURA,
  February 	15, 1947 The 	first question was: All over the district of Noakhali there is talk 	that the Muslim 	population should boycott the Hindus in every way. Some Muslims who 	have  worked 	for the Hindus recently or helped them during the riots report that 	they are under threat of boycott. In this context what should be the 	duty of those Muslims who genuinely desire peace.  Gandhiji 	replied that he had heard 	of the boycott 	before. But he 	entertained the 	hope that such was not 	the case on any 	extensive scale. He 	had one case brought 	to his 	notice three or 	four days ago 	by a Muslim traveller 	from Gujarat who had come 	to see 	him. He 	was rebuked for 	daring to 	want to 	see him. The 	traveller stood his 	ground and 	came out 	of the 	ordeal safely. 	Another poor Muslim who 	had come today was 	threatened with dire 	penalty if he dared 	to go to him. 	He did 	not know what truth 	there was 	in the 	report. The 	speaker then instanced 	printed leaflets that were pasted  on 	the walls in the name of the Muslim pitunilibtech_808_footnoteParty. These 	instances gave 	colour to 	the question. 	He would 	say to 	the Muslim 	friends and others 	that these things should 	not frighten or 	disturb them. 	They should ignore these things if 	they were isolated 	instances. If 	they were on 	an extensive scale, 	probably the Government 	would deal 	with the situation. 	If unfortunately 	boycott became the policy 	of the 	Government, it 	would be a 	serious matter. He 	could only think 	non-violently. If 	they gave proper 	compensation he 	would probably advise 	acceptance. He could 	not think 	out there 	and then the 	pros and 	cons. If, 	on the 	other hand, they resorted 	to confiscation, 	he would 	advise people to 	stand their ground and 	refuse to 	leave their homesteads 	even on pain of death. 	This he 	would say 	of all 	provinces whether 	Muslim majority or Hindu 	majority. He 	however hoped that no 	Government would be 	mad enough 	to subscribe 	 to the 	policy of 	boycott whether with or 	without compensation. 	Those who belonged 	 to the land 	for ages 	could not be removed 	from their homesteads merely for 	the reason that 	they found themselves 	in a 	minority. That 	was no religion, 	Hindu, Muslim, 	Christian or 	any other. 	It was intolerance.  The 	second question was: 	At East 	Keroa you 	advisedlibtech_809_footnotepeasants to 	work co- 	operatively in 	their fields. Should they 	pool together their land and 	divide the 	crop in 	proportion to the area of 	the fields they held? Would you give us an outline of the idea   of how exactly they are to work in a co-operative manner?  Gandhiji 	said that the question was good and admitted of a simple answer. His        
 notion of co-operation was that the land would be held in co-operation by the owners and tilled and cultivated also in co-operation. This would cause a saving of labour, capital, tools, etc. The owners would work in co-operation and own capital, tools, animals and seeds etc., in co-operation. Co-operative farming of his conception would change the face of the land and banish poverty and idleness from their midst. All this was only possible if people became friends of one another and as one family. When that happy event took place, there would be no ugly sore in the form of communal problem.

He then 	referred briefly to the speech reported to have been made by the 	ex-Premier Maulvi Fazlul 	Huq. He was reported 	to have 	said that as a non-Muslim 	Gandhi should not preach 	the teachings 	of Islam, 	that instead of 	Hindu-Muslim unity 	he was 	creating bitterness 	between the two 	communities and 	that had he (Gandhiji) 	gone to 	Barisallibtech_812_footnotehe would 	have driven him into 	the canal. 	He also 	wondered how the 	Muslims of Noakhali and Tippera could tolerate Gandhi’s presence so long.  Gandhiji 	said that he 	had grave doubts 	about the accuracy 	of the 	report. If 	it was 	the correct summary of 	the speech, 	he would 	consider it to be most 	unfortunate coming 	from a 	man holding 	the responsible 	position that the Maulvi 	Saheb held and 	aspiring to 	be the President 	of the 	Muslim League. He 	was not aware 	of having 	done anything 	to create 	bitterness between the 	two communities. The 	speaker had 	never claimed 	to preach 	Islam.

In 	the same speech Fazlul Huq had said that when Gandhiji returned from 	South Africa he had asked him (Gandhiji) to embrace Islam, whereupon 	Gandhiji had said that he was a Muslim in the true sense of the 	term. Mr. Huq had requested him to proclaim it publicly, but 	Gandhiji refused to do so. He said that he had no recollection 	whatsoever of the conversation and he was never in the habit of 	suppressing from the public what he had said privately. The 	audience, however, knew that he had stated in      
 various speeches in the district that he considered himself as good a Muslim as he was a Hindu and for that matter he regarded himself as an equally good Christian or Parsi. That such a claim would be rejected and on some occasions was rejected, he knew. That, however, did not affect his fundamental position and if he had said what was attributed to him by Fazlul Huq, Gandhiji would gladly declare his repentance if he would believe what was represented to him. Indeed he had put forth the claim in South Africa to be a good Mussalman simultaneously with being a good member of the other religions of the world. He would repeat for the sake of the ex-Premier of Bengal that he was misreported and he would welcome the correct version from him.libtech_813_footnote

  TALK WITH HINDU 	WORKERSlibtech_814_footnote     November 	21, 1946 
  Your 	proposal that 	these demands should be 	satisfied before 	the Peace Committees can 	be formed, 	virtually means a summary 	rejection of the 	peace offer. 	This will only succeed in 	embittering feelings 	still further. 	The Government 	offer should 	be accepted 	on grounds 	of expediency. 	I do not however 	plead for peace 	at any 	price, certainly not 	at the price of 	honour. Let 	us act on the square, and 	let us put them in 	the wrong. 	It was 	exactly in 	this way that Indians 	were able to 	gain the silent 	sympathy of 	a large 	number of Europeans 	in South 	Africa. If, 	after a 	fair trial, the 	Committees are 	found unworkable, you 	can come out with your honour 	intact. That sense of honour will give you a courage which no man can beat.  If 	I succeed cent per cent in my own plan, then conditions will 	improve. But of this, there does not seem to be any prospect at the 	present moment. Yet, as a man of hope, I continue to hope against 	hope. In the present case, I confess through bitter experience that 	there is no sign of change of heart, but certainly there has been a 	change of plan. Considerations of expediency demand that the 	proposal should therefore be accepted.  He 	also added that hitherto 	our non-violence 	had been 	non-violence of 	the weak; 	but now that we had to apply it against a section of our own 	countrymen instead   of against the British, it had to be non-violence of the strong.  The 	demands were now 	examined one 	by one. 	In place 	of the 	demand that 	certain Muslim officers 	should be replaced 	by Hindu 	officers, Gandhiji remarked that it was unreasonable and a 	communal demand.  While 	putting forward such a proposal, you should ask yourself if the 	Muslims of Bihar can reasonably make a similar demand. In my 	opinion, the present demand is absurd and I would personally never 	countenance it. You can, of course, substitute in its place, 	“impartial officers in place of biased ones”; that would be 	fair.  Then 	there was a demand for the removal of the Superintendent of Police. 	Gandhiji was against it also. In his opinion, the guilt lay 	elsewhere. The Chief Minister’s wishes might have been carried out 	by this officer, for he could not      
 obviously act on his own initiative. Someone remarked that Abdullah Saheb was a man without conscience. Gandhiji immediately replied :
 I   have   yet   to   see   a   Police   Superintendent   who   has   a    conscience. Mr. Suhrawardy was perhaps the fulcrum. He wanted to show the whole world what he was capable of doing. But he over-reached himself.
 Someone then pointed out to Gandhiji that the Ministry in Bihar had employed Muslim armed soldiers to quell the disturbances, the suggestion being that this was for the appeasement of the Muslims. Gandhiji was clearly of opinion that such a thing, if true, was surely a sign of weakness.
 The last point raised was in connection with the Hindu members of the Peace Committees. Manoranjan Chaudhuri pleaded for postponement, as most of the leading Hindus had left the district and only poor weavers, blacksmiths or farmers remained behind. If these were to be on the Committees, they would be no match for the more intelligent and educated Mussalman representatives. Gandhiji said with some warmth that if many had fled, leaving neighbours to their own fate, they did not deserve to be called leaders. The seats would have to be occupied by barbers, washermen and the like, who were as much interested in the preservation of their life and property as the rich. It was not unlikely that they might submit to the influence of Muslim members. But the risk had to be run if true democracy was to be evolved. Gandhiji then referred to the history of democracy in England, and expressed his admiration for the manner in which the common people of England had fought every inch of the ground for the preservation of their rights; and in this connection he mentioned the name of Wat Tyler.

 APPENDIX II
 BRITISH CABINET’S STATEMENT ON GROUPINGlibtech_815_footnote
 December 6, 1946 The conversations held by His Majesty’s Government with Pandit Nehru, Mr.  Jinnah, Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan and Sardar Baldev Singh came to an end this evening, as
 Pandit Nehru and Sardar Baldev Singh are returning to India tomorrow morning.
 The object of the conversations has been to obtain the participation and co-
 
 
 
 operation of all parties in the Constituent Assembly. It is not expected that any final settlement could be arrived at since the Indian representatives must consult their colleagues before any final decision is reached.
 The main difficulty that has arisen has been over the  interpretation  of paragraph 19(v) and (viii) of the Cabinet Mission’s Statementlibtech_816_footnoteof May 16, relating to the Meetings in Sections which run as follows :
 Paragraph 19(v) : These Sections shall proceed to settle provincial constitutions for the Provinces included in each Section and shall also decide whether any Group constitution shall be set up for those Provinces and if so, with what provincial subjects the Group should deal. Provinces should have power to opt out of Groups in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause
 (viii) below :
 Paragraph 19(viii) : As soon as the new constitutional arrangements have come into operation, it shall be open to any Province to elect to come out of any Group in which it has been placed. Such a decision shall be taken by the Legislature of the Province after the first General Election under the new Constitution.
 The Cabinet Mission have throughout maintained the view that the decisions of the Sections should, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, be taken by simple majority vote of the representatives in the Sections. This view has been accepted by the Muslim League, but the Congress have put forward a different view. They have asserted that the true meaning of the Statement, read as a whole, is that the Provinces have a right to decide both as to Grouping and as to  their own constitutions.
 His Majesty’s Government have had legal advice which confirms that the Statement of May 16 means what the Cabinet Mission have always stated was their intention. This part of the Statement, as so interpreted, must, therefore, be considered an essential part of the scheme of May 16, for enabling the Indian people to formulate a constitution which His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to submit to Parliament. It should, therefore, be accepted by all  parties  in  the Constituent Assembly.
 It is however, clear that other questions of interpretation of the Statement of May 16 may arise, and His Majesty’s Government hope that if the Council of the Muslim League are able to agree to participate in the Constituent Assembly, they will also agree, as have the Congress, that the Federal Court should be asked to decide matters of interpretation that may be referred to them by either side and will accept such a decision, so that the procedure both in the Union Constituent Assembly and in
 
 the Sections may accord with the Cabinet Mission’s Plan.
 On the matter immediately in dispute, His Majesty’s Government urge the Congress to accept the view of the Cabinet Mission in order that the way may be opened for the Muslim League to reconsider their attitude. If, in spite of this reaffirmation of the intention of the Cabinet Mission, the Constituent Assembly desires that this fundamental point should be referred for the decision of the Federal Court, such reference should be made at a very early date. It will then be reasonable that the meetings of the Sections of the Constituent Assembly should be postponed until the decision of the Federal Court is known.
 There has never been any prospect of success for the Constituent Assembly, except upon the basis of agreed procedure. Should a constitution come to be framed by    a Constituent Assembly in which a large section of the Indian population had not been represented, His Majesty’s Government could not, of course, contemplate—as the Congress have stated they would not contemplate—forcing such a constitution upon any unwilling parts of the country.

 SRIRAMPUR,
 Thursday, December 19,  1946
 In the morning, while I was administering his daily bath, Gandhiji spoke to me of his own accord about the happenings of the 17th. Ever since that day, no word had passed on this subject between him and me.
 He wished to learn from me as well as from Parasuram ‘if Sushila Nayyar had fallen in our estimation’ (Tumhari nazar me gir gai hai?) on account of that day’s incident. I said I could speak for myself, not for Parasuram. She had undoubtedly fallen, and the reason was this. No person however great had the right to disturb him as Sushila had apparently done. Gandhiji then said, ‘Supposing she did so with a good intention, perhaps to help me in my own work? She may have been suggesting certain steps even for my sake, not for her own; even then, would you say she was wrong?’
 I said, ‘Yes, even then. If she felt that you were contemplating a wrong step, she might have offered her suggestions and then left you free to decide.’
 Gandhiji said, ‘She is against my plan of tour on foot in the present condition of my health. she thinks that at least one old companion who knows all about my personal needs should accompany me, and she offered her own services. She
 
 suggested that it would not be safe to depend on new workers like you and Parasuram, who know so little about my physical requirements.’
 I said, ‘If I had been in her position, I would have placed my views fully before you and left you free to decide. If the decision had not been favourable, I would have waited patiently until you discovered your error.’
 After I spoke, Gandhiji repeated the substance of my views in his  own  language in order to make sure that he had understood me rightly.

 Sunday, December 22, 1946
 At night while reading Bapu’s diary I read “I had a curious dream”. I casually asked him what it was. He did not say and I kept quiet.
 At three o’clock the next morning, I woke up with the noise of Bapu jumping in bed. He said he was very cold and was taking exercise to warm up. After that, he asked me if I was awake and started telling me of his curious dream. After the dream he started explaining how his present step was a tapascharya (penance) for him, and how he was going through inconveniences. On the previous day, I had remarked that God did and would send him helpers in whatever he did.       In a short note I asked him if I
 would be allowed to come with him. I mentioned that what he had said about tapascharya and what I had said about God sending him help were not contradictory and tried to explain it. He answered with irritation that he had tried to explain things  to me but had not succeeded. . . . I could see that he was getting worked up. So I
 walked away. Suddenly I heard him slap his forehead. I rushed back and stopped him. . . .
 I am completely unnerved	I came yesterday with great trepidation.  Bapu
 had asked me to come for Gita	He again raised the topic this morning and I found
 that my self-control has not returned as yet.

 JAWAHARLAL NEHRU’S DRAFT OF CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE STATEMENTlibtech_820_footnote
 December 22, 1946
 The Working Committee have given careful consideration to the state ment issued by the British Government on December 6, 1946, as well as other statements made recently on their behalf in Parliament. These statements, though made by way of interpretation and elucidation, are clearly additions to and variations of the British Cabinet Mission’s Statement of May 16, 1946, on which the whole scheme of the Constituent Assembly was based.
  The 	Statement of 	May 16, 1946, laid down 	in paragraph 	15(iii) as basic 	principles of 	the constitution 	“all subjects other than Union subjects and 	all residuary powers 	should vest in the 	Provinces”, and 	that “Provinces 	should be 	free to 	form Groups 	with executives and 	legislatures”. The 	Provinces were 	thus intended to 	be autonomous, 	subject to the 	Union controlling certain 	specified subjects. Paragraph 	19 laid down, inter 	alia, 	the procedure 	for Sections 	to meet, 	for decisions 	to be taken 	as to whether 	Groups should be formed 	or not, 	and for any province 	to elect 	to come 	out of the Group 	in which 	it might 	have been placed.  In 	their resolution of 	May 24, 1946, 	the Working 	Committee pointed out 	what appeared 	to be a 	divergence between 	the basic 	principles and 	the procedure suggested, 	in that 	a measure 	of compulsion 	was introduced 	which infringed the basic 	principle of provincial 	autonomy. The Cabinet 	Mission, thereupon 	 issued  a Statement 	on May 	25, 1946, in 	which it 	was stated 	that “the interpretation put 	by the 	Congress resolution on 	paragraph 15 	of the Statement, to 	the  effect  that the provinces can 	in the 	first instance 	make the 	choice whether 	or not 	to belong 	to the Section 	in which 	they are placed does 	not accord with 	the Delegation’s 	intentions. The 	reasons for 	grouping of 	the provinces 	are well 	known and this 	is an essential 	feature of the 	scheme and 	can only be 	modified by 	agreements between 	the two parties”.  The 	Congress made it 	clear later that their 	objection was not to 	provinces entering 	Sections but to 	compulsory grouping and 	the possibility of 	a dominating 	province framing a 	constitution for 	another province entirely 	against the wishes 	of the 	latter. This might result 	in the 	framing of 	rules, franchise, 	constituencies etc., for 	elections and 	otherwise which might 	seriously prejudice or 	even nullify the 	provision for 	a province 	subsequently to opt 	out of a 	Group. We 	pointed out 	that this could 	never be the intention of the Cabinet Mission as it would be repugnant to the basic 
 
 
 principles and policy of the scheme they had propounded. Our own approach to the problem of constitution making has all along been that coercion should not be exercised and that the constitution of free India should be drawn up by the co- operation and goodwill of all parties concerned.
  In 	a letter dated 13th June, 	1946, from Lord Wavell to 	Maulana Azad, the 	President of the 	Congress, it 	was stated 	that “The Delegation and 	I are 	aware of 	your objections 	to the 	principle of 	grouping. I 	would, however, point 	out that 	the Statement 	of 16th 	May does 	not make 	grouping compulsory. It 	leaves the 	decision to 	the elected 	representatives of the 	provinces concerned 	sitting together in 	Sections. The 	only provision 	which is 	made is 	that the 	representatives of 	certain provinces 	should meet in 	Sections so 	that they can 	decide whether or 	not they 	wish to form 	Groups”. Thus the 	principle which was 	emphasized again was 	that grouping was 	not compulsory 	and in regard to Sections a certain procedure was indicated. This 	procedure was not clear 	and could 	be interpreted 	in more 	than one way and in 	any event 	a point 	of procedure could 	not override 	a basic 	principle. We 	pointed out 	that the 	right interpretation 	should be one 	which did 	no violence 	to that 	principle. Further, in 	order to 	smooth the 	way to the 	co-operation of 	all concerned in the 	working of 	the proposed 	scheme we suggested 	that if our 	interpretation was 	not accepted, we 	would be agreeable to a reference on this point to the Federal Court.  It 	is well known that the 	proposal in 	regard to grouping 	affected injuriously 	two provinces 	especially, namely, Assam 	and the North-West 	Frontier Province, 	as well 	as the 	Sikhs in 	the Punjab. 	Their representatives 	expressed their strong 	disapproval of 	this proposal. 	In a 	letter from 	Master Tara Singh to 	the Secretary 	of State 	dated 25th May, 1946, 	he gave 	expression to 	the anxiety 	and apprehensions 	of the 	Sikhs and asked for clarification 	in regard 	to certain 	matters. The 	Secretary of 	State sent an 	answer to 	this letter on 	1st June, 	1946, in the 	course of 	which he 	said, “I 	have considered carefully 	the detailed 	points you raise 	at the 	end of your 	letter. I 	fear the Mission 	cannot issue any 	additions to, 	or interpretation 	of, the 	Statement.”  In 	spite of 	this explicit 	statement, the 	British Government 	have, on 	December 6th, 	issued a 	statement which is 	both an 	addition to, 	and an interpretation 	of, the Statement 	of May 16, 1946. 	They have done so after 	more than six and a half 	months, during which 	period many developments have taken place as 	a consequence  of the 	original Statement. 	Throughout this period 	the position 	of the 	Congress was 	made repeatedly 	clear to the 	British Government or 	their representatives, 	and it 	was with 	full knowledge of this 	position that the British 	Government acted. That position 	was in conformity 	with the basic principles 	laid down in 	the Statement 	of May 	16, 1946, which Statement 	the Congress 	had accepted in its 	entirety. Further, 	the Congress 	had expressed 	its willingness 	to refer, 	if necessity 	arose, the 	point of 
 interpretation to the Federal Court, whose decision should be accepted by the parties concerned.
  When 	the invitation 	of the 	British Government 	was received by the 	Congress at 	the end of 	November last 	to send 	its representatives to 	London, the 	Congress position was 	clearly indicated again. 	It was 	on certain 	assurances of the 	Prime Minister 	of Great 	Britain that 	a representative 	of the 	Congress proceeded to 	London.  In 	spite of 	this assurance 	and of 	previous assurances to 	the effect 	that no 	additions to, 	or interpretations 	of, the Statement 	of May 	16, 1946, were 	going to 	be made, 	the British Government 	have now issued 	a statement 	which clearly, 	in many 	respects, goes 	beyond the original 	Statement, on the 	basis of 	which progress 	has been 	made till now.  The 	Working Committee 	deeply regret that 	the British 	 Government should 	have acted in a 	manner which 	has not been 	in keeping with 	their own 	assurances, and 	which has 	created suspicion in 	the minds 	of large 	numbers of people 	in India. For 	some time past 	the attitude of the 	British Government 	and their 	representative in 	India has 	been such as 	to add to 	the difficulties 	and complexities 	of the 	situation in 	the country. 	Their present intervention, on 	the eve of 	the meeting 	of the 	Constituent Assembly, and 	the manner and 	tone in 	which this has 	taken place, 	has lessened 	the chances 	of a peaceful 	and co-operative 	transfer of power 	in India, 	for which the 	Congress has 	been working. This has 	created a 	new situation 	which is full 	 of peril 	for the future, 	and because 	of this, 	the Working 	Committee have been anxious 	and given 	prolonged thought to it. 	Many of 	the speeches 	made recently in the 	British Parliament, 	which abound in wrong 	statements and 	inferences, are 	in tone and 	content representative 	of the 	authoritarian and 	aggressive traditions of 	British Imperialism. 	The India 	of today 	cannot tolerate this 	approach from 	any outsider and 	resents alien 	interference and intervention.  The 	Congress, however, cannot 	be diverted 	from its path by 	provocative utterances 	and external 	intervention. It seeks 	to frame, through 	the Constituent 	Assembly, a constitution 	of a free and independent 	India with the willing  	co- operation 	of all 	elements of 	the Indian 	people. The Working 	Committee regret that the 	Muslim League members of the constituent 	Assembly have 	refrained  from attending 	its opening 	session. The Committee, 	however, appreciate and 	express their 	gratification at 	the presence 	in the 	Constituent Assembly of 	representatives of 	all other 	interests and sections 	of the people 	of India, 	and note 	with pleasure the spirit 	of co-operation 	in a 	common task and 	a high 	endeavour which 	has been 	in evidence 	during the 	sessions of 	the Assembly. 	The Committee 	will continue 	their efforts 	to make 	the Constituent 	Assembly fully 	representative of 	all the people 	of India 	and trust that members of the Muslim League will give their co-operation in this great 
 task. In order to achieve this, the Committee have advised Congress representatives in the Assembly to postpone consideration of controversial issues to a subsequent meeting.
  In 	their Statement 	of December 	6, 1946, 	the British 	Government in 	giving their 	interpretation of 	a doubtful 	point of 	procedure have 	referred to 	it as a “fundamental 	point”, and suggested 	that the Constituent 	Assembly may refer 	it to the 	Federal Court. Subsequent 	statements made on behalf 	of the British 	Government have made 	it clear that they are not prepared to accept the decision of this 	court should it go against 	their own 	interpretation. On 	behalf of 	the Muslim 	League also it has 	been stated 	that they will not be 	bound by 	the decision 	of the 	Federal Court. 	While the Congress 	has always 	been willing to abide 	by such 	a reference 	and decision 	in regard to this 	matter, any reference 	now, when none of the 	other parties are 	prepared to 	join in 	it or to accept it, 	becomes totally uncalled 	for and unbecoming, 	and unsuited 	to the 	dignity of 	either the 	Congress or 	the Federal 	Court. By their 	repeated statements, 	British Statesmen have 	ruled this out.  The 	Working Committee are 	still of 	opinion that 	the interpretation 	put by 	the British 	Government in regard 	to the 	method of 	voting in 	the Sections 	is not 	in conformity with 	provincial autonomy, 	which is one 	of the 	fundamental bases of 	the proposed 	constitution. Nevertheless, the 	Committee are 	anxious to 	avoid anything 	that may 	come in 	the way of 	the successful 	working of the 	Constituent Assembly. To 	ensure this 	they will 	endeavour to seek and obtain 	the largest 	measure of  co- 	operation, provided that 	no fundamental 	principle is violated. 	They are, therefore, 	advising Congress 	representatives in 	the Constituent Assembly 	to accept the 	procedure suggested. But 	they cannot be 	parties to 	any coercion of 	a province against 	its will 	or to the 	interests of 	the Sikhs 	being made to suffer 	by a 	majority in 	a Section. 	In particular, 	any attempt 	to impose 	the basic 	structure of 	a provincial 	constitution, such 	as franchise, 	constituencies etc., 	against the wishes 	of  the 	 majority of 	representatives from 	the province 	concerned will have to 	be resisted. Such 	an imposition 	would render nugatory the 	right to 	opt out which 	has been given 	to a Province.  The 	Working Committee 	earnestly hope that their 	efforts to gain 	the co- operation in 	the Constituent 	Assembly of those 	who have so far 	denied it 	will meet 	with response 	and success, 	so that 	the great work that has now begun may proceed 	rapidly and 	end in the framing of 	a constitution which does 	justice and gives 	freedom and 	opportunity to 	every man 	and woman in 	India. In 	any event 	the Constituent 	Assembly must 	go on till 	it has 	accomplished its 	task and 	a free, 	democratic, and 	sovereign republic 	emerges from its labours.

 A. I. C. C. RESOLUTIONlibtech_821_footnote
 The A. I. C. C. having considered the events that have taken place in the country since the Meerut Session of the Congress in November last, the statement issued by the British Government on December 6, 1946, and the statement of the Working Committee of December 22, 1946, advises Congressmen as follows :
 The A. I. C. C. endorses the statement of the Working Committee of December 22, 1946, and expresses its agreement with the views contained therein.
 While the Congress has always been agreeable to making a reference to the Federal Court on the question of interpretation in dispute, such a reference has become purposeless and undesirable owing to recent announcements made on behalf of the British Government. A reference could only be made on an agreed basis, the parties concerned agreeing to abide by the decision given.
 The A. I. C. C. is firmly of opinion that the constitution for a free and independent India should be framed by the people of India on the basis of as wide an agreement as possible. There must be no interference whatsoever by any external authority, and no compulsion of any province or part of a province by another province. The A. I. C. C. realizes and appreciates the difficulties placed in the way of some provinces, notably Assam, the N. W. F. P. and Baluchistan and the Sikhs in the Punjab, by the British Cabinet’s scheme of May 16, 1946, and more especially by the interpretation put upon it by the British Government in their statement of December 6, 1946. The Congress cannot be a party to any such compulsion or imposition against the will of the people concerned., a principle which the British Government have themselves recognized.
 The A. I. C. C. is anxious that the Constituent Assembly should proceed with the work of framing a constitution for free India with the goodwill of all parties concerned, and, with a view to removing the difficulties that have arisen owing to varying interpretations, agrees to advise action in accordance with the interpretation of the British Government in regard to the procedure to be followed in the Sections. It must be clearly understood, however, that this must not involve any compulsion of a province and that the rights of the Sikhs in the Punjab should not be jeopardized.libtech_822_footnoteIn
 
 the event of any attempt at such compulsion, a province or part of a province has the right to take such action as may be deemed necessary in order to give effect to the wishes of the people concerned. The future course of action will depend upon the developments that take place and the A.I.C.C., therefore, directs the Working Committee to advise upon it, whenever circumstances so require, keeping in view the basic principle of provincial autonomy.

APPENDIX VIII
 LETTER FROM SATIS CHANDRA MUKERJEElibtech_823_footnote
 January 14, 1947
 Longevity can be prolonged indefinitely if only the utterance of Ramanama (the lord’s name) becomes with the sadhaka, not an act of conscious will or choice, but gets to be an automatic, inward process, springing from within and expressing itself outwardly, consciously or sub-consciously. This, in my view, is only possible when the utterance of the Lord’s name gets tacked on to, or better, becomes a part of the sadhaka’s breathing-movement.
 Therefore my second point is that the Lord’s name or Ramanama is no more an outer sound emitted by the sadhaka, but is verily a form of spiritual or Divine Energy. My third point is that when the utterance of Ramanama gets to be intimately
 associated with the breathing-movement of the sadhaka, it is bound to react on the
 whole of the sadhaka’s external system, including the mental apparatus, scripturally known as the Lingasharira or the sukshma sharira.
 My fourth point is that when the Spiritual or Chit Energy of the Divine so reacts, then the whole apparatus sthula and sukshma, gets to be impregnated with the Spiritual or Chit Energy derived from, or inhering in, Ramanama. Therefore when that happens, what is to us at present material (whether of grosser or the finer variety), becomes so energised by the Spiritual or Chit Energy (which is the essence of Ramanama), that the laws of matter manifesting themselves in material disinte-
 
 
 the initial stages. Those who participate in the Constituent Assembly or the Sections will proceed to frame a constitution in terms of the Cabinet Mission’s Statement, which constitution will be initially binding on them alone. 6. The constitution must be framed for the whole of India with specific provision laying down how those who have not participated in its making may avail themselves of it.” (Sardar Patel’s Correspondence, “Indians in Ladysmith”)
 
 gration and decay become, for the time being, suspended so to say. As the result of such suspension, the sadhaka could go on existing on the objective plane (as an objective entity), immune from the operation of the force which tends towards disintegration and decay.
 Lastly and fifthly, at this stage equanimity, a term which you have used, cannot be termed mental, that is, born of the control of the mind-stuff. Then it comes to be a function of the sadhaka’s soul life, and may therefore be called soul- born. At this stage the equanimity in question comes to be natural, deep, and spontaneous.
 The above point may be made clearer by saying that the type of equanimity which comes to be born of the process of utterance of Ramanama along with every exhalation and inhalation of the sadhaka’s breath, far transcends in its very nature the kind of equanimity of which we cannot at present conceive. the reason for it, as already pointed out, is that the type of equanimity in question is no longer mindborn, but is essentially an apparatus of soul-life or spirituality. This higher type of equanimity is scripturally termed as shanti. Of this type of shanti there are higher and higher grades of which the Gita speaks as, for example, (IV. 39) para shanti and (V.
 12) naishthiki shanti.
