In the absence, however, of any such explana-tion in the terms of the Settlement itself, the Government are unable to attach to the word in question any but its ordinary meaning, viz., “given back”, and, while they are ready at any time to carry out the agreement in this sense, they do not feel justified in throwing On the taxpayers the expense of transporting the articles from the places where they now are. I am to say that your further contention that the Government are responsible for delivering such articles in the same condition in which they were seized, does not appear to be warranted by anything in the terms of the Settlement. On the contrary clause 16(c) of the Settlement expressly says that “compensation will not be given for deterioration”. I am to add that under section 4(3) of Ordinance IX of 1930 even property seized but not forfeited may be used in such manner as the Magistrate may direct. The motor-car and cycle now in question were, however, actually forfeited and had they been sold or destroyed, the original owners would have had no further claim to them, since clause 16(a) of the Settlement agrees to the return of seized moveable property only if it is still in the possession of Government. I am therefore to express the hope that you will now make arrangements to take delivery of these forfeited articles without more delay, since it will not be possible for Government to be responsible for their custody indefinitely if those interested do not choose to avail themselves of clause 16(a) of the Settlement."
