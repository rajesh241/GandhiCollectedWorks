libtech_1_footnote,"1When Gandhiji was 15, he had removed a bit of gold from his brother’s armlet to clear a small debt of the latter. He felt so mortified about his act that he decided to make a confession to his father. Parental forgiveness was granted to him in the form of silent tears. The incident left a lasting mark on his mind. In his own words, it was an object-lesson to him in the power of ahimsa."
libtech_2_footnote,"2According to Mahatma Gandhi : The Early Phase, p. 212, one of the senten- ces in the confession was : “So, father, your son is now, in your eyes, no better than a common thief.”"
libtech_3_footnote,"1When 	his nephew and co-worker, Chhaganlal Gandhi, was proceeding for the 	first time to London in 1909, Gandhiji gave him his “London Diary” 	The diary filled about 120 pages. Chhaganlal Gandhi gave it to 	Mahadev Desai in 1920. But, before doing so, he copied out in a 	notebook about 20 pages of the original. The remaining 100 pages 	were not continuous writing, but merely a chronicle of incidents 	during his stay in London from 1888 to 1891. The original being 	untraceable, Chhaganlal’s copy is reproduced here with minimum 	editing. Gandhiji wrote the diary in English when he was 19."

It was argued that Parliamentary Government was 	very different from any form of representation known to the village 	communities of India. The Bill excluded Indians from the franchise 	on the ground that they had not exercised the franchise in their own 	country. The Indians pleaded that they had done so from ancient 	times in their village communities. But The 	Natal Mercury contested 	this view, and that of Sir Henry Sumner Maine, in his 	Village-Communities in 	the East and West, that 	Indian had been familiar with representative institutions almost 	from time immemorial. It maintained that Indian village-communities 	had nothing to do with political repre- sentation but only with the 	legal question of land tenure. It argued that village- community 	life was common to all primitive peoples and, if anything, proved 	the backwardness of a people, and quoted General Sir George 	Chesney's views in The 	Nineteenth Century to 	the effect that Indians were still in their political infancy."
