Tamil translator . . . expressed regret that his translation should have caused Gandhiji the distrubance. Gandhiji said, he was not at all to blame. The Andhra gentleman . . . had by now come up . . . to explain himself . . . Gandhiji rebuked him saying that he should first have made his request to him either in a note or in person instead of disturbing the prayer and trying to dictate what should be done. By so doing, he had  only forced him to come to a decision not to have translations at all and thus prevented his coming into contact with the people in the manner he wanted. The offender persisted in his attempts to further press his case, while expressing his regret for what had happened. Dr. Sushila Nayyar interrupted at this stage, and asked him not to cause Gandhiji unnecessary strain. The gentleman then withdrew.”"

I gave him a letter of introduction. Owing to illness he 	was not able to meet him, but sent on my letter. Later I received a 	letter from Mr. Gandhi, which bore my name and his signature in his 	own handwriting. I still have that letter and regard it as one of my 	cherished possessions.” The addressee came to know Gandhiji in 	South Africa while staying with her uncle, the Rev. Charles Philips, 	who was deeply interested in the Asiatic question. She did nursing 	work in the two World Wars and met Gandhiji during his visit to 	England."
